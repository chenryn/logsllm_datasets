sale on carder marketplaces, but lacked ﬁner grained data. In
this paper, we empirically explore interesting questions such
as the impact of EMV chip deployment by focusing in depth
on the leaked data from one of the major carder shops.
A study on the impact of EMV chip deployment in the U.K.
found a strong displacement effect of fraud moving from card-
present to card-not-present transactions [13,14]. We observed
far less pronounced displacement in this shop. Another study
cited carder shop prices of $20–30 per account [16]. While
this range matched initial offer prices, we show that buyers
were often able to purchase accounts at discounted prices.
Prior work has developed methodologies and performed
analyses of leaked or seized back-end data of for-proﬁt cyber-
crime enterprises including bullet-proof hosting [33], DDoS
attack services [18, 25], fake AV [39], illicit pharmaceuti-
cals [30], reshipping scams [23], and spam campaigns [40].
In our study, we adapted some of these methods to the leaked
dataset, and developed new analysis methodologies and met-
rics tailored to understanding marketplaces selling stolen ac-
counts. This has resulted in a deeper understanding of these
marketplaces, and an analysis framework that could be reused
on similar datasets by stakeholders such as law enforcement.
3 Authenticity and Ethics
The data that we analyze in this study was not collected by
us, but initially obtained by an unknown third party through a
presumably unauthorized means of access. We do not specu-
late about the motives behind this hack, but it is clear that as
in prior studies, our use of “found data” creates concerns of
authenticity and ethics [30, 39, 40].
3.1 Ethics
The ﬁrst concern is whether it is acceptable to analyze third-
party data likely obtained through unlawful means, and with-
out the usual standard of “informed consent.” We make a
utilitarian argument in line with prior studies of criminal
backends [18, 23, 30, 40]. Better understanding the economic
forces and common strategies in ﬁnancial fraud provides ben-
eﬁts to society by helping to improve countermeasures and
reduce future losses. The authors also believe that making
this knowledge more widely known does not contribute to
future fraud, as fraud strategies are already well documented
in underground forums.
We additionally took a number of steps to ensure that our
analysis does not create further harm. Firstly, we do not name
the shop in order not to provide any validation or beneﬁt to the
perpetrator of the hack. We also wish to avoid publicity for
the shop, which is still open for business. Secondly, when we
received a copy of the leaked data, we were assured that law
enforcement and other stakeholders such as card networks and
banks had already been notiﬁed about the affected accounts.
Thirdly, we only report aggregate or pseudonymous data. Per-
sonally identiﬁable information was either removed from the
dataset before it was shared with us, or hashed to allow de-
tection of duplicates while avoiding identiﬁcation of involved
parties. Most notably, the analyzed database contained no
identifying information about cardholders, as names had been
removed, and account numbers had been hashed, except for
the ﬁrst six digits identifying the bank. We submitted our
protocol to NYU’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) and our
study was deemed to not be human subjects research and it
was exempted.
3.2 Authenticity
Given the circumstances of how the dataset was obtained, we
needed to assess its authenticity and accuracy. As the ﬁrst step,
we conﬁrmed with security companies that information in the
database matched information they had previously scraped
from the shop. Furthermore, we received conﬁrmation that
test purchases done on behalf of banks were indeed present
in the database.
Second, we considered the internal and cross consistency
of the data. There were direct concordances between the
different elements of the database schema. For example,

when (re)computing seller commissions for batch releases
of accounts, we encountered only 16 (0.2%) of over 8,505
seller-release combinations where our calculations did not
match the shop’s calculations. The median disagreement was
roughly $30, or the price of about two accounts. We also
compared the number of sales per release in the orders table
to the recorded number of sales in the release statistics ta-
ble. There were only 11 (0.1%) of over 8,505 seller-release
combinations where the numbers differed. Disagreements
between order and inventory tables were minimal as well. Out
of over 7 million purchased magnetic stripe accounts, only
46 did not appear in the inventory table. For CNP accounts,
59 out of 300 k purchases were not listed in the inventory
table. We also found concordances between transaction and
customer support ticket data. For example, refund tickets had
a corresponding shop transaction. Finally, we determined
that 96.2% of 260 k unique Bitcoin wallet addresses from the
database were present on the public blockchain. This makes
us conﬁdent that the data we analyze is indeed authentic.
4 Data
While we received a copy of the leaked database, it did not in-
clude any code. Consequently, we needed to reverse engineer
the database schema and resolve ambiguities in the data.
Shop User Accounts. The database contains a table with
information related to individual shop users, such as user
identiﬁers and current account balances. Some entries were
ostensibly test accounts, others were created to vent frustra-
tions of being banned. For the purpose of this study, we con-
sider only active user accounts that have successfully bought
or sold accounts, which reduces the number of user accounts
from 89,196 to 75,109. We also deduplicated user accounts
based on information the shop administrators kept in the table.
Duplicate user accounts were created when a user was locked
out of their original account, since the site did not appear to
support password resets. Some users appeared to create new
accounts when the reputation of their old one was such that
they were no longer issued refunds. This further reduced the
number of accounts to 67,812 buyers and 121 sellers.
Card Account Information. Two tables contained a com-
plete record of all stolen accounts listed on the shop, split into
magnetic stripe and CNP. This data included the card num-
ber (hashed in our case), BIN, timestamp of when the card
was initially available for purchase, zip code (of the billing
address for CNP, and presumably where the card was stolen
for magnetic stripe), and additional metadata such as the card
type. The shop database also listed the issuing banks’ names,
which we manually mapped to a uniform representation in
case a single bank’s name appeared with variations.
Shop Transactions. The database contained a table with a
row for each completed order. We utilized several data points
in this table to perform our analysis of card pricing, buyer
activity, and revenue. We were able to compute the fees
collected by the shop for each sale by joining two internal
tables. Based on orders and fee percentages, we computed
the seller’s commission for each release.
To identify whether an order had been subsequently re-
funded, we combined the orders table with another table that
indicated user balances before and after a transaction, where
a refund can be identiﬁed by the after balance being larger.
Customer Support Tickets. The database also contained
customer support tickets, which we used to contextualize and
anecdotally support some of our ﬁndings. Site users, both
buyers and sellers, created support tickets through a dedicated
“support” tab on the shop. In their responses to these pri-
vate inquiries, site admin often used boiler plate language,
indicating that many shop users had similar questions.
5 Analysis
We begin our analysis of the shop with an overview of key
statistics over the four-year span of the dataset, as summa-
rized in Table 1. A total of 19 million unique accounts issued
by 7,092 different banks were listed for sale. The shop had
accumulated $103.9 M in gross revenue over the 4 years of the
data. The vast majority (95%) of this revenue was from sales
of stolen magnetic stripe accounts, over 20 times more than
the $4.8 M in gross revenue for CNP. The relative demand
for CNP accounts, however, was far greater than for magnetic
stripe accounts. Indeed, the shop sold 84% of all CNP in-
ventory, in contrast to only 40% of available magnetic stripe
accounts. With an inventory 42 times smaller than magnetic
stripe, the CNP market appeared to be limited by supply.
After deduplication, we counted 67,813 unique buyers and
121 sellers who had completed at least one purchase or sale
on the marketplace. There were 11 dual-role accounts that
both bought and sold. The markets for magnetic stripe and
CNP were fairly segmented, with only eight sellers (7%), and
21,718 buyers (32%) active in both. These “universal” shop
users were more proliﬁc than users operating in only one
domain. For example, their median net spend was 9.7 times
higher than CNP-only buyers (3.7 times higher than magnetic
stripe-only), and their median commissions were 4.4 times
that of specialized sellers. This suggests that only the most
skilled carders operated in both markets. In contrast, most
small-to-mid level actors were active in only one domain, and
may have specialized due to different skill sets and strategies
necessary for stealing and cashing out magnetic stripe and
CNP accounts. Most of our analysis explores these two largely
disparate markets separately.
5.1 Sellers
The shop depends on a consistent supply of freshly stolen
accounts, which are offered by external sellers. Gross rev-
enue of the shop was heavily biased towards the top sellers.
The largest seller alone contributed over 28% of the entire

shop’s gross revenue. When considering only CNP sales, the
largest seller in that domain was responsible for almost 60%
of revenue. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2, just 18 of
the highest-revenue sellers (15%) accounted for 81% of the
shop’s gross revenue. From an intervention perspective, this
indicates that undermining the activities of these few top sell-
ers could signiﬁcantly decrease the supply of stolen accounts,
and consequently the shop’s revenue. Especially the more
supply-constrained CNP market relies on its top seller. Given
the almost two times larger fraction of unsold magnetic stripe
inventory, however, it is possible that demand in that market
could be satisﬁed by the remaining sellers and inventory (al-
beit it is unclear whether their supply is as attractive as that
of the top sellers).
Accounts listed on the shop were grouped in releases, each
originating from a single seller. These releases had median
sizes of 791 magnetic stripe accounts, and 564 accounts for
CNP. Each release was assigned a seller commission rate
based on negotiation with the shop. These seller commissions
varied considerably, with a minimum of 45% and a maximum
of 90%. Perhaps due to the more restricted supply, the av-
erage commission for a CNP release was 81%, whereas an
average magnetic stripe release yielded only 55%. As shown
in Figure 3, the median seller earned $47 k in commissions,
and the highest earning seller almost $16.9 M.
Based on the perspective of this single shop, it appears
that many sellers are capable of sourcing stolen magnetic
stripe data, and that competition among sellers has resulted in
reduced commissions. On the other hand, few sellers seem to
be able to steal CNP account data, which may have allowed
them to negotiate higher commissions.
5.2 Buyers
The shop did not vet buyers, and provided a fully automated
account creation and purchasing process. As a result, 21,209
users in the database never made any purchase. The shop at-
tracted buyers of varying sophistication levels, ranging from
“amateur” to “professional” fraudsters. From a ﬁnancial point
of view, nearly all spending in the shop was due to repeat
customers (99.1% for magnetic stripe, and 91.9% of CNP).
Loyal buyers with higher spending and lower refund rates
were given discounts and access to new releases of accounts
before the rest of the customers. On the other end of the
customer spectrum, we observed support tickets from likely
inexperienced buyers requesting assistance in selecting ac-
counts for purchase. The willingness of the shop to give
advice to novice buyers highlights the potential of automated
shops to facilitate both professional and amateur fraud.
As shown in Figure 6, buyers of both magnetic stripe and
CNP accounts tended to spend more than buyers who focused
on one account type, but all kinds of buyers exhibited large
variation in the amount they spent. Even though the shop
had over 67 k active buyers, 81.3% of total spending was
concentrated in the top 9.3% (6,296) of buyers, as shown
in Figure 5. The highest spending buyer accounted for only
0.48% ($495 k) of the shop’s total revenue. This implies that
an intervention targeting only the highest spending buyers
would have a limited effect on the shop, unless it can disrupt
thousands of buyers.
5.3 Pricing
When customers purchased accounts, the prices they paid
ranged from $0.21 to $256.76 for magnetic stripe data, with a
median price of $13.91. CNP accounts ranged from $0.93 to
$48.50 with a median of $12.61. (These purchase prices do
not account for refunds, which we discuss in Section 5.5.)
Purchase prices of accounts changed over the course of
the dataset. The median purchase price of a magnetic stripe
account decreased from $15.66 in 2015 to $12.75 in 2018
(−18.6%), whereas it increased from $5.46 to $14.55 for CNP
(+166%). (This is also shown in Figure 12 in the appendix.)
During this time period, the shop witnessed an accumulat-
ing oversupply of magnetic stripe accounts, and increasing
demand for CNP accounts in short supply.
Customers frequently paid less than full price for their pur-
chases. Around 31% of purchased magnetic stripe, and 11%
of CNP accounts were advertised and sold at a discount. The
shop offered such discounts for older stock or bulk account
packages. In addition to these discounts that were available
to all customers, the shop also granted discounts to loyal
customers with a high purchase volume. Loyalty discounts
applied to 75% of magnetic stripe and 90% of purchased CNP
accounts, potentially overlapping with advertised discounts.
Across all sold accounts (including non-discounted sales),
