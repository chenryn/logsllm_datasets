the resultant social overlay network ’s graph structure prop-
erties (e.g., fast-mixing [22]) for their robustness. The chal-
lenge of churn, however, has been little addressed in these
SNSD designs, thus making them potentially vulnerable to
heavy churn.
In this paper, we focus on designing a robust social network-
based Sybil defense in the face of heavy churn as observed
in the real-world. To understand the magnitude of churn
in today’s distributed systems, we measure the number of
concurrent Skype users online over a 7-month period in 2014
at a granularity of 5-minute interval. We observe that only
10-25% of all users are online at any given instance. Fur-
thermore, our analysis of the datasets of Yahoo!
Instant
Messenger [7, 8] reveals that only a small fraction (5-15%)
of all users are online concurrently, corroborating the Skype
online concurrency pattern.
We examine the impact of such heavy churn on the so-
cial overlay network, created out of the trust relationships
of immediate neighbors of each node, which lies at the heart
of these decentralized SNSD schemes. Heavy churn disin-
tegrates this One-Hop overlay1 into multiple disconnection
components, as depicted in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). This re-
sults in poor network connectivity with two honest nodes
despite being online may not be able to communicate with
each other due to the disconnected overlay. A Two-Hop over-
lay created by adding links to all the 2-hop neighbors of
each node, similar to the one proposed in MCON [28], im-
proves the network connectivity but comes at the cost of
very poor attack resilience (Fig. 1(c)). This is because of
the creation of new 2-hop relationships, which also include
those between honest and Sybil nodes amounting to nearly
3 orders of magnitude greater than that of the One-Hop over-
lay under a modest attack. Note that the attack resilience
of SNSD schemes typically relies on the trust relationships
between the honest and Sybil nodes (attack edges) to be few.
We explore a new design point in the trade-oﬀ between
network connectivity and attack resilience. Our approach
aims to improve the network connectivity while incurring a

ious contexts (e.g., (i) ‘1-hop’ attack edges, and (ii) the ‘common
neighbors’ of two nodes, respectively).

Sybil regions are represented by green and red nodes respectively. Churn disintegrates the overlay from Fig. 1(a) to Fig. 1(b).
Two-Hop overlay is better connected but has a signiﬁcantly large number of 2-hop attack edges (Fig. 1(c)). Our approach
(Fig. 1(d)) strikes a balance in the trade-oﬀ between network connectivity and attack resilience, with a modest number of
disconnected online honest nodes from the largest connected component of the online honest region and 2-hop attack edges.
modest cost in terms of attack resilience (Fig. 1(d)). We
propose adding links from each node to only a selective few
k of its 2-hop neighbors based on a minimum expansion con-
tribution (MinEC) [20] heuristic. The main idea of MinEC is
that the formation of a potential 2-hop link (v, x) between
nodes v and x depends on the number of common neighbors
between the two nodes while penalizing their node degrees.
We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments
in a simulated environment. Our experiments reveal the
following. First, MinEC fares as good as Two-Hop in terms
of network connectivity and One-Hop in terms of attack re-
silience, for a wide range of parameter conﬁgurations. Sec-
ond, on our datasets with average degree 8-24, MinEC re-
quires only a few k ≈ 100 of all the 2-hop neighbors of
each node to achieve such level of robustness. This sug-
