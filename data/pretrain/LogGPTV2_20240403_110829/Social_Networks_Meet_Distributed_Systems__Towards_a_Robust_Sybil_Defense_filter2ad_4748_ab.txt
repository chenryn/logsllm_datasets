The graph structure properties of the resulting social overlay network, such as fast-mixing [22], are often considered for their robustness. However, these designs for Sybil defenses in social networks (SNSD) have largely overlooked the challenge of churn, making them potentially vulnerable to high levels of user turnover.

In this paper, we focus on developing a robust SNSD that can withstand heavy churn, as observed in real-world distributed systems. To quantify the extent of churn, we measured the number of concurrent Skype users online over a 7-month period in 2014, with data collected at 5-minute intervals. Our findings indicate that only 10-25% of all users are online at any given time. Additionally, an analysis of Yahoo! Instant Messenger datasets [7, 8] revealed a similar pattern, with only 5-15% of users being concurrently online.

We investigate the impact of such significant churn on the social overlay network, which is constructed from the trust relationships among immediate neighbors of each node—a core feature of decentralized SNSD schemes. Heavy churn can fragment this One-Hop overlay into multiple disconnected components, as illustrated in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). This fragmentation leads to poor network connectivity, where two honest nodes, even if both are online, may be unable to communicate due to the disjointed overlay. A Two-Hop overlay, created by adding links to all second-degree neighbors, as proposed in MCON [28], improves connectivity but significantly reduces attack resilience (Fig. 1(c)). This is because the new 2-hop relationships include many connections between honest and Sybil nodes, increasing the number of attack edges by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to the One-Hop overlay under a modest attack. The effectiveness of SNSD schemes generally depends on minimizing the number of trust relationships (attack edges) between honest and Sybil nodes.

To address this trade-off between network connectivity and attack resilience, we explore a novel design approach. Our method aims to enhance network connectivity while maintaining a reasonable level of attack resilience. We propose adding links from each node to a selective few k of its 2-hop neighbors, based on the Minimum Expansion Contribution (MinEC) heuristic [20]. The MinEC heuristic evaluates the potential 2-hop link (v, x) between nodes v and x by considering the number of common neighbors while penalizing the node degrees.

Our extensive experimental evaluations in a simulated environment show that the MinEC approach performs as well as the Two-Hop overlay in terms of network connectivity and as well as the One-Hop overlay in terms of attack resilience, across a wide range of parameter configurations. Specifically, on datasets with an average degree of 8-24, MinEC requires only a small number of 2-hop neighbors (k ≈ 100) per node to achieve this level of robustness. This suggests that our approach effectively balances the need for good connectivity and strong attack resilience, even in the presence of heavy churn.
