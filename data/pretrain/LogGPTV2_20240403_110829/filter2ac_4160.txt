**Title: Advanced Techniques in Modern Banking Trojans at Botconf 2013**

Banking Trojans have proven to be a highly effective business model for cybercriminals. However, the implementation of URL blacklists has significantly disrupted their operations. This presentation will explore the innovative command-and-control (C2) methods that cybercriminals have developed to evade these blacklists.

Another significant challenge for banking Trojan authors has been the emergence of Google Chrome and the 64-bit version of Microsoft Internet Explorer. These new browsers require novel techniques to intercept encryption functions and execute Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) attacks. The talk will delve into the specific strategies and technical approaches that banking Trojan developers use to overcome these challenges.
