### Abstract:
The detection of covert channels in an information flow model is crucial for verifying the security guarantees of an operating system. The Asbestos system is a well-known framework for protecting information confidentiality. This poster presents a formal approach to automatically detect covert channels in the Asbestos system. Our method innovatively generalizes a CSP (Communicating Sequential Process) based formal description of the Asbestos system and leverages Ray's noninterference equivalence for channel detection. The covert channels are identified using the CSP-based model checking tool FDR2.

**Keywords:** Covert Channel, CSP, Noninterference

### 1. Introduction
Information Flow Control (IFC) models are a class of computer security models that regulate access to all subjects and objects within a system. The recently developed Asbestos system extends traditional IFCs, enabling practical applications. However, the increased flexibility of the Asbestos system makes it more vulnerable to covert channel attacks compared to classical IFCs. There is limited research on the automatic detection of covert channels in the Asbestos system. This poster introduces a formal model using CSP concepts and demonstrates the automatic detection of covert channels in the Asbestos system.

### 2. Formal Detection Model
The formal detection model is defined as follows:

- **Detection Scheme (DS):** 
  - **CR:** Control Rules of the Asbestos system.
  - **GIFS:** Generalized Information Flow System, where \( \text{GIFS} = <S, O, \text{CONSTRAIN}, \text{IPC}, \text{IO}, \text{STATE}> \).
    - \( S \): Set of subjects.
    - \( O \): Set of objects.
    - **CONSTRAIN:** Control engine that manages information flow according to CR.
    - **IPC:** Set of events among subjects and objects, including {send, recv, create, created, delete, deleted, read, isread, write, written, execute, executed}.
    - **IO:** Set of events among subjects, including {io}.
    - **STATE:** Internal channels that CONSTRAIN uses to acquire or modify labels of subjects and objects.
  - **ASSERT:** An assertion stating "the Asbestos system has no covert channels."

Using CSP notions, the Detection Scheme DS can be represented as:
\[ \text{DS} = \text{OBJECTS} || (\text{aCONSTRAIN} \setminus \text{aOBJECT}) \]
where:
- \(\text{aCONSTRAIN} = \{\text{state, random, lock, unlock, pid, cr}\}\)
- \(\text{aOBJECT} = \{\text{command i P j Q command, created, deleted, isread, written, born, exit, ipc}\}\)

The ASSERT in the detection schema is based on Ryan's noninterference equivalence in CSP. Ryan's noninterference equivalence states that the set of failures of a system with all HIGH events shielded is equivalent to the set of failures of this system preventing all HIGH events. Formally:
\[ (\text{DS} || \text{STOP aHIGH}) \equiv (\text{DS} \setminus \text{aHIGH}) \]
where:
- \(\text{aHIGH}\) represents all high-level or security-sensitive events.
- \(\text{STOP aHIGH}\) means putting STOP in parallel with DS, synchronized over all HIGH events.
- \(\text{DS} \setminus \text{aHIGH}\) means preventing all high-level events.

If the Asbestos system satisfies Ryan's noninterference equivalence, we can assert that the system has no covert channels. Otherwise, if the equivalence cannot be verified, we conclude that the system has covert channels. We use the CSP model checker FDR2 for automatic detection.

### 3. Detection
The detection of covert channels in the Asbestos system is an automated formal verification process. The control rules (CR) in the Asbestos system can be represented as:
\[ \text{CR} = \text{cr requery then } (\text{cr res true if sender} \rightarrow \text{flow sender receiver}) \]
\[ \text{CR else } (\text{cr res false if sender} \rightarrow \text{!flow sender receiver}) \]

In a verification example, FDR2 took 42 seconds to complete the process and provided a counterexample, indicating the presence of covert channels in the Asbestos system.
