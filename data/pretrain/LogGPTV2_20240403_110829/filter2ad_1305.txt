Abstract. The detection of covert channels in an information flow  model is a 
practical  problem  in  determining  whether  the  security  guarantees  of  the 
operation system have been achieved. Asbestos system is a typical information 
confidentiality  protection  system.  This  poster  introduces  a  formal  approach to 
automatically  detect  covert  channels  in  Asbestos  systems.  The  approach 
innovatively  generalizes  a  CSP  (Communicating  Sequential  Process)  based 
formal  description  of  Asbestos  system  and  utilizes  Ray’s  noninterference 
Equivalence  in  the  detection  of  covert  channels.  The  covert  channels  are 
automatically detected by employing a CSP based model checking tool FDR2. 
Keywords: Covert Channel, CSP, Noninterference.

Introduction 
The Information Flow Control models (IFCs) usually refer to such class of computer 
security models, which require access of all subjects and objects under their control 
on a system wide basis. Recently developed Asbestos system [1] extends information 
confidentiality models (classical IFCs), resulting in its real application in practice. 
However,  as  Asbestos  system  becomes  more  flexible,  it  gets  more  susceptible  to 
covert channel attacks than classical IFCs. Few works discuss automatic detection of 
covert channels in Asbestos system. This poster contributes the field a formal model 
in CSP notions and realizes automatic covert channel detection in Asbestos system.

Formal Detection Model 
The formal detection model is defined as follows: 
Detection Scheme =
CR GIFS ASSERT  
,
,
CR represents the Control Rules of Asbestos system.   
GIFS  represents  the  Generalized  Information  Flow  System,  More  precisely, 
> , where S is the set of subjects, O 
GIFS
is  the  set  of  objects,  CONSTRAIN  is  the  control  engine  which  controls  the 
information flow in the system according to CR, IPC is the set of events among

That is, the Detection  Scheme is the synchronization of the  OBJECTS (representing 
all activities of subjects and objects) and the CONSTRAIN (representing information 
flow controls), with internal activities  (

The  ASSERT  in  the  detection  schema  is  based  on  Ryan’s  noninterference 
Equivalence  [2]  in  CSP.  Ryan’s  noninterference  Equivalence  states  that  the  set  of 
failures of a system with all HIGH events shielded is equivalent to the set of failures 
of this  system preventing all  HIGH events. That is:  (

where  aHIGH represents  all  high  level  events  or  all  security  sensitive  events.  That 
STOP   represents putting STOP in parallel with DS synchronized over all HIGH

level  events.  If  Asbestos  system  satisfies  Ryan’s  noninterference  Equivalence,  then 
Asbestos  system  is  noninterference,  and  we  can  assert  that  Asbestos  system  has  no 
covert  channels.  Otherwise,  if  Ryan’s  noninterference  Equivalence  can  not  be 
verified, we will assert that Asbestos system has convert channels. We utilize a CSP 
model checker FDR2 in automatic detection.

Detection 
The  detection  of  covert  channels  in  Asbestos  system  is  an  automatically  formal 
verification process. The CR in an Asbestos system can be represented as follows:

FDR2 spent 42 seconds to complete a verification example. It gives out a counter 
example, which shows Asbestos has covert channels.
