User: If I schedule print "Hello World!"; to run every hour with crontab, where will Hello World! be printed? Is there a log file?
If I do it with Java or C instead of Python, will it make any difference?
Thanks!
Assistant: They will be sent to the email address defined at the top of the crontab, or to the crontab's owner by default. See the crontab(5) man page for more details.
