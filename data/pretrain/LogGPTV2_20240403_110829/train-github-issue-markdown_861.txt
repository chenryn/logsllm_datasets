Found in variables.less (and, possibly in other files .less source files),
comments that start with `//*` can trick some compilers or style highlighters
as `/*` combination typically means start of a comment block. Add a space
after the double-slash (e.g. `// *`) or use a different ( _and consistent_ )
commenting style that does not create comment style clashes.
