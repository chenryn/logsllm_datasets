Hello.
We using react for some our projects and found, what on staging servers it
start generate warning about "It looks like you're using a minified copy of
the development build of React. When deploying React apps to production, make
sure to use the production build which skips development warnings and is
faster".
We still need all possible warnings about propTypes or about
controlled/uncontrolled components to debug all issues on environment, which
as close as possible to production, but still is not production. In this case
"staging" environment should be builded with minification to check app before
delivering on production.
Proposal: remove this warning (
react/src/renderers/dom/ReactDOM.js
Lines 94 to 100 in 67f8524
|  warning(  
---|---  
|  (testFunc.name || testFunc.toString()).indexOf('testFn') !== -1,  
|  'It looks like you\'re using a minified copy of the development build ' +  
|  'of React. When deploying React apps to production, make sure to use ' +  
|  'the production build which skips development warnings and is faster. ' +  
|  'See https://fb.me/react-minification for more details.'  
|  );  
) for `NODE_ENV === 'staging'` env, if this possible.
Thanks.
