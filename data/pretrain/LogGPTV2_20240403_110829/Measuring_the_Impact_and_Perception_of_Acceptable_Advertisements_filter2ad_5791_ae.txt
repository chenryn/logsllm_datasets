### Filter Matches Analysis

**Figure 8: Filter Matches per Group Ranking**
- Each row represents 1,000 domains within the respective Alexa ranking group.
- For each group, we plot the frequency at which each filter is triggered by domains in that group.

- Frequency scale: 1.00, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25, 0.00
- Number of Exception Filters: 1, 10, 100

**Figure 7: ECDF of Filter Matches per Surveyed Domain**
- We only include domains with at least one match.
- A single filter may match multiple elements (or requests) on a single domain.
- The solid line represents the total number of matches, while the dashed line represents the number of unique matching filters.

### Analysis of Top Filters

For the most popular sites taken from Alexa, we analyzed the top 50 most frequently activated filters. We found that the 5 most activated filters out of both the EasyList and Whitelist were all from the whitelist. These filters also related to Google, suggesting they may be more broad than necessary.

- **Whitelist Filters**: Skewed more towards shopping websites, aligning with their purpose.
- **Trigger Frequency**: 4 of these filters were triggered more often by the top 5,000 websites than by any other group. One filter, used for conversion tracking, was most frequently triggered by domains ranked between 100,000 and 1,000,000 on Alexa.

### User Perception Survey

**Goal**: To ensure that both publishers and users find whitelisted ads acceptable.

**Survey Method**:
- Conducted via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.
- Participants: 305 respondents, each paid $1 US, with at least 5,000 approved submissions and a 98% approval rate.
- Browser Usage: 61% Google Chrome, 28% Firefox, 9% Safari, 1% Opera, 1% Internet Explorer.
- Ad Blocking: 50% of users used some form of ad-blocking software.

**Sites Analyzed**:
- Google (search engine)
- Imgur (image hosting service)
- Walmart (online retailer)
- IsItUp.com (web service)
- Utopia-game.com (online game forum)
- Cracked.com (humor website)
- ViralNova (viral content curator)
- Reddit (user-submitted content site)

**Survey Statements**:
1. **Eye-Catching Ads**: "The advertisements are eye-catching and grab my attention."
   - Examples: Google Ad #2 (73% agree/strongly agree), Utopia Ad #2 (45%).
2. **Distinguished from Content**: "The advertisements are clearly distinguished from page content."
   - Example: ViralNova grid images (90% not distinguished from content).
3. **Obscuring Content**: "The advertisements on this page obscure page content or obstruct reading flow."
   - Examples: Sidebar ads, first search results, and top bar ads (e.g., Reddit #1, Google #1, Cracked.com #1).

**Summary**:
- Broad disagreement among participants about what is acceptable, confusing, or inhibiting.
- Highlights the need for deeper and larger studies to develop a more precise and flexible ad-blocking policy.

### Undocumented Filters

**Google's Introduction**:
- Officially added to the whitelist on June 21, 2013 (Rev. 200).
- Prior exceptions for specific publishers, such as golem.de, included unusual filters that made them active on www.google.com.
- These filters were modified two weeks later to match other restricted AdSense exceptions.

**A-List Filters**:
- 61 instances of Eyeo adding whitelist filters without community vetting, referred to as A-filters.
- No public disclosure or forum links provided.
- Added in Rev. 287, with the most recent addition in Rev. 955.
- Exceptions for large companies like Walmart and Time Warner Cable.
- A59 includes an unrestricted filter for Google’s AdSense for search service, observed on 78 distinct domains.

### Conclusion

The analysis and survey highlight the complexity and subjectivity in determining acceptable ads. Further research and user feedback are essential to refine and improve ad-blocking policies.
