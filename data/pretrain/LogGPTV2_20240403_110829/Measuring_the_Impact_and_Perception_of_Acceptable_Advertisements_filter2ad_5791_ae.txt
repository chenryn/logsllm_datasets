Figure 7: ECDF of ﬁlter matches per surveyed domain. We only include

for the most popular sites taken from Alexa. We chose the top 50
most frequently activated ﬁlters and found that the 5 most activated
ﬁlters out of both the EasyList and Whitelist were all ﬁlters from
the whitelist. These ﬁlters also related to Google. This implies that
these ﬁlters may be more broad than necessary.
We ﬁnd that the whitelist ﬁlters are skewed more towards shop-
ping websites, which we can attribute to the ﬁlter’s purpose.
We also ﬁnd that 4 of these ﬁlters were triggered more often by
the top 5,000 websites than by any of the other groups. There is one
ﬁlter that was used most often by the group of domains consisting
from Alexa rank 100,000 to 1,000,000. This particular ﬁlter is used
for conversion tracking.
6. USER PERCEPTION
Underlying the Acceptable Ads program is the goal that both
publishers and users ﬁnd the whitelisted ads to be acceptable. There
have been many studies of how users perceive Web advertisements
(e.g., [21]), and the degree to which they intrude on the user experi-
ence (e.g., [18]). In this section, we build on these efforts to survey
user perception of advertisements on popular websites based on the
criteria stated in Eyeo’s Acceptable Ads guidelines [1]. We used
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk [2] to solicit participation, limiting our
pool to workers with at least 5,000 approved submissions and at
least 98% approval rate. Each of the 305 respondents were paid
1$US and completed the 72 question survey in about 10 minutes.
50% of the users used some form of ad blocking software before,
with 61% using the Google Chrome browser, 28% using FireFox,
9% Safari, and 1% each for Opera and Internet Explorer. The results
of the survey are discussed below and shown in Figure 9.
The online survey showed eight different sites, each containing
one or more advertisements allowed by Adblock Plus. The eight
sites were selected based on their popularity and diversity of ad
placement. Speciﬁcally, we choose a search engine (Google), an
image hosting service (Imgur), an online retailer (Walmart), a Web
service (IsItUp.com), an online game forum (Utopia-game.com), a
humor website (Cracked.com), a viral content curator (ViralNova),
and a user-submitted content site (Reddit).

Figure 9: User perception survey results.
For each whitelisted advertisement, we asked the participants to
rate their level of agreement with statements relating to acceptability
on a Likert scale, e.g., “Strongly Disagree,” “Disagree,” “Neutral,”
“Agree,” or “Strongly Agree.” Each statement is a direct transcription
from the Adblock Plus policy (with minor adjustments for clarity)
and states characteristics that must or must not be true for an ad-
vertisement to be “acceptable”. Ideally, Adblock Plus should only
allow advertisements that meet these criteria.
Statement 1: The advertisements are eye catching and grab my
attention. - This ﬁrst statement measures the level of distraction
that the advertisement has on the user. There were two types of
advertisements that many users found to be attention grabbing or
distracting. Figure 10 shows two examples of the advertisements
deemed most attention getting, (10a, Google Ad #2, with 73%
agreeing or strongly agreeing) the image-based sales advertisements
displayed with search results on engines and, (10b, Utopia Ad
#2, 45%) the advertising bar next to navigation buttons on many
websites.
Statement 2: The advertisements are clearly distinguished from
page content. - This statement is designed to measure how well the
user can distinguish the advertisements from page content. Illus-
trated in Figure 10, the mixed content/advertising grid images used
in curator websites such as ViralNova appears to intentionally blur
the lines between advertisement and content. Almost 90% of users
viewing all grid-layout ads stated that they were not distinguished
from the content. Hence the allowance by Adblock Plus seems to
be in conﬂict with the program’s stated policies.
Statement 3: The advertisements on this page obscure page con-
tent or obstruct reading ﬂow. - This last statement measures the
degree to which users feel the ads are intrusive on content use. While
the mixed content/advertising grids seem to inhibit some content
use, other ad strategies were viewed as more invasive. In particular,
a little more than a third of users viewed sidebar advertisements
(e.g., Reddit #1, not shown), ﬁrst search results (Google #1), and
top bar advertisements (Cracked.com #1) as inhibiting.
Summary. While the above results are instructive, one must be
careful not to over-read the meaning of one survey. A summary of
the survey results in Figure 9(d) shows that there is broad dissension
amongst the participants about what was acceptable, confusing,
or inhibiting. However, this reenforces our experience; we have
observed that each person views advertisements differently—often
vastly so. Therefore, any single policy of whitelisting is unlikely
to serve the needs of a large and diverse user community well.
Developing deeper and larger studies of user desires is needed to
develop a better understanding of user preferences and ultimately a
more precise and ﬂexible advertisement blocking policy.
7. UNDOCUMENTED FILTERS
Over the course of our analysis outlined in the previous sections,
we discovered several instances where ﬁlters were added without

community vetting or public disclosure. For completeness, we
discuss two representative instances here.
Google’s introduction. Google was ofﬁcially added to the whitelist
on June 21, 2013 (Rev. 200).17 Prior to this, Eyeo allowed some
publishers (but not all) to show Google AdSense for search ads on
their own search pages. Of particular note among these exceptions
are the two ﬁlters added for golem.de (Rev. 67, Dec. 2012).18

These exception ﬁlters are structured differently than previous Ad-
Sense ﬁlters. Namely, the ﬁrst exception speciﬁes both golem.de
and www.google.com in the domain list. This is unusual as the
addition of Google in the ﬁrst-party domain option is not neces-
sary for showing search advertisements on golem.de. Rather, this
option makes the ﬁlter active on www.google.com. The second
ﬁlter is even more unusual as it unblocks the adBlock element
on www.google.com, i.e., the ﬁlter does not make any reference
to golem.de. None of the previous AdSense exceptions included
analogous ﬁlters.
Roughly two weeks later, Eyeo modiﬁed these ﬁlters19 to match
other restricted AdSense exceptions. In particular, they removed
www.google.com from the domain list in the ﬁrst ﬁlter and deleted
the second ﬁlter entirely.

The forum post for the golem.de ﬁlters does not provide any ra-
tionale for the initial dissimilarities between these other AdSense
exceptions, nor does it indicate the purpose of the later changes (or
even mention such changes were made). However, during the two
weeks the original ﬁlters were active, Google could conceivably
have used the ﬁlters (especially the element ﬁlter) to measure the
impact of whitelisting by adding an element with id adBlock. This
element would be active via the whitelist when normal ads were not.

Figure 11: Subset of A-ﬁlter groups. In contrast to typical ﬁlters, A-ﬁlter
groups do not contain a comment with a link to the forum. Insofar as we can
determine, none of these ﬁlters were publicly disclosed by Eyeo. In total, we
uncovered 59 A-ﬁlter groups.
A-List ﬁlters. There are 61 instances of Eyeo adding whitelist ﬁlters
without community vetting—many of which are exceptions for large
companies. We refer to these as A-ﬁlters because of the nondescript
comments preceding each group in the whitelist, e.g. !A1. Figure 11
shows four example sets. Insofar as we can determine, none of
these ﬁlters were publicly disclosed. In other words, none of the
A-ﬁlter groups appear in Eyeo’s notiﬁcation forum. Nearly all A-
ﬁlter additions use the same repository commit message, “Updated
116whitelists.”20 In contrast, for other ﬁlters, Eyeo includes a link to
the appropriate forum post in both the commit message and with a
comment in the whitelist itself.
Eyeo ﬁrst added A-ﬁlters in Rev. 28721, with sets A1 and A2.
Since the addition of these ﬁrst ﬁlters, Eyeo has continued to add A-
ﬁlters to the whitelist. The most recent one being A61 in Rev. 955.22
Over time they have also removed 5 A-ﬁlter groups; one of these
was re-added as a different A-ﬁlter, i.e. A7 as A28 in Rev. 625.23
Among the ﬁlters added are exceptions for large companies such
as Walmart and Time Warner Cable. Domains within an A-ﬁlter
group appear to be closely related, possibly under the same parent
organization, e.g., media company IAC owns both about.com and
ask.com.24
In Rev. 78925 Eyeo added A59. This ﬁlter group includes an unre-
stricted ﬁlter for Google’s AdSense for search service. Speciﬁcally,
this ﬁlter allows nearly all domains to show Google search ads.26
As we see in Table 4, this AdSense exception was the ninth most
popular ﬁlter in our survey, having been observed on 78 distinct
domains.
