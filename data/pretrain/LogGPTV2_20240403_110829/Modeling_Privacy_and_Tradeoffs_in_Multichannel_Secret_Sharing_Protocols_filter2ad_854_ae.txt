curve is actually well-behaved beyond a certain point. These

points correspond exactly to the bumps in the rate curve, i.e.,
for a given κ, the effects of delay are problematic for this
implementation only if there are fewer than κ underutilized
channels. This seems to be a direct consequence of the
simpliﬁed channel selection approach, since underutilized
channels will almost always be available to send according
to epoll, so the implementation will rarely need to wait for
additional channels to become available.
C. High-Bandwidth Channels
Our ﬁnal experiment is designed to push the limits of the
system and implementation to see how long they are able to
sustain near-optimal rates as the available bandwidth increases.
In other words, we wish to see at what point the bottleneck
becomes something other than the capacity of the channels. To
accomplish this, we return to the Identical setup and gradually
increase the channel rate from 100 Mbps to 800 Mbps in
increments of 25 Mbps. The multichannel rate is measured at
each point using iperf, as in the ﬁrst experiment.
First we choose parameters κ = μ = 1 so as to fully
maximize the multichannel rate. As shown in Figure 6, this

Individual channel rate (Mbps)
Fig. 6: Optimal and achieved rate for Identical setup with
increasing channel rate and μ = 1
results in performance leveling off around 750 Mbps total, or
when the individual channel capacity reaches approximately
150 Mbps. To complement this, we run another round of
experiments with μ = 5 and varying values of κ, for which the
overall multichannel rate will be lower for the same total
amount of trafﬁc. Interestingly, even though the threshold
affects the rate very little during normal operation, it makes a
signiﬁcant difference once the system and implementation are
pushed to their limits, with large κ values causing the protocol
to fall short of optimal much sooner than small values.

VII. CONCLUSION
to understand the inherent privacy and
performance tradeoffs of any approach to network privacy.
In this work, we have presented a rigorous model of multi-
channel secret sharing protocols in real networks, including
a corresponding privacy measure. From this model, we have
derived formulas and programs to calculate optimal privacy
and performance metrics from the properties of individual
channels and the parameters of the protocol. Benchmarks on
a reference implementation demonstrated the utility of our
model, reinforced the accuracy of our analysis, and showed
that multichannel secret sharing protocols can be efﬁciently
