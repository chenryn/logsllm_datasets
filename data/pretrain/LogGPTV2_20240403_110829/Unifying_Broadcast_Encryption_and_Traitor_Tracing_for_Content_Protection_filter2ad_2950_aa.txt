Abstract
In this paper we study the design of efﬁcient trace-
revoke schemes for content protection. In state-of-art,
broadcast encryption and traitor tracing are viewed as
two orthogonal problems. Good traceability and efﬁcient
revocation seem to demand different types of design. When
combined into trace-revoke schemes, existing schemes only
offer efﬁciency on one aspect but weak on the other. More-
over, there are two major styles of pirate attacks, namely
the clone device attack and anonymous re-broadcasting
attack. In current state-of-art,defending against these two
attacks are viewed as two different problems that demand
different trace-revoke schemes. In current state-of-practice,
a content protection system has to deploy two trace-revoke
schemes in order to provide complete protections against
both attacks. As a result, the system incurs the complexity
of having to manage two schemes, even worse the overall
strength of the system is the weakest link in either scheme.
In this paper we present a uniﬁed trace-revoke system
that can offer superior efﬁciency on both traceability and
revocation capability as well as simultaneously defend
against two attacks in a uniﬁed way. Our uniﬁed system
offers everything that the original two schemes combined
can provide, but our system is much simpler and more
efﬁcient. The design of our uniﬁed framework carries both
scientiﬁc and real world practical signiﬁcance. We reduce
the tracing time from tens of years to hours. The much
improved simplicity and efﬁciency of our uniﬁed system
caused it to be adopted by the new version of AACS [1],
This same paper entitled “A uniﬁed broadcast encryption and traitor
tracing system for clone attack and anonymous attack” was accepted to
appear in Annual Computer Security Application Conference 2007, but
had to withdraw from proceeding due to on-going commercialization. A
patent was ﬁled early 2007.
Advanced Access Content System,
the industry content
protection standard for the new Blu-ray TMhigh-deﬁnition-
video optical discs. Scientiﬁcally our design shows it is
possible to design an efﬁcient broadcast encryption scheme
and traitor tracing scheme in a uniﬁed way. We also
showed the equivalence of the two major types of attacks
which are currently viewed as different attacks. This opens
brand new directions for future research on broadcast
encryption and traitor tracing.
I. Introduction
This paper is concerned with the protection of copy-
righted digital content. Piracy has become a more and
more serious concern for the movie and music industries.
The receiving devices like DVD players are interchange-
ably called receivers, decoders or devices in this paper.
A broadcast encryption system [2] has been shown
to be very useful
in content protection. It allows the
broadcaster to distribute content to authorized devices and
exclude(revoke) compromised devices.
Since the content in these models is usually large, a
broadcast encryption scheme adopts hybrid encryption.
More concretely, each receiver is assigned a set of unique
secret keys (called device keys); another key (called the
media key) is randomly chosen to indirectly encrypt the
content. The enabling building block for revocation is a
structure called a Media Key Block (MKB) that gets put
in the header and distributed together with the content, for
example, on the movie disc. An MKB is essentially the
media key encrypted by non-revoked receivers’ device keys
again and again. A non-revoked device can use one of its
valid device keys to decrypt the MKB and obtain the valid

media key to decrypt the content. If a receiving device is
revoked in this MKB, it will get garbage after decrypting
the MKB and therefore cannot access the content.
Different pirate attacks can happen in the above system.
In a clone attack, one or more devices are compromised
and the extracted device keys are used to construct a
clone device (or a software program) that can decrypt the
encrypted content. Once a clone is found, it is possible
to feed testings to the clone and deduce which (traitor)
keys are inside the clone box based on the outcome
of the testings. Broadcast encryption and traitor tracing
schemes [3] for clone attack can be combined into trace-
and-revoke schemes [5], [6], [7].
Anonymous attack
is
also referred to be
”re-
broadcasting attack” in the literature [8], [9]. In this type of
attack, attackers redistribute the media key or the decrypted
content to stay anonymous and avoid being identiﬁed. Thus
different versions of the content and content encrypting
keys need to be used. A series of recovered pirated copies
of the content/keys allows the detection of the traitors who
have involved in constructing and distributing the copies. A
trace-and-revoke scheme for anonymous attacks has been
shown in [12].
The revocation efﬁciency of a broadcast encryption
system is mainly measured by the size of the header,
namely the MKB, since that is the communication over-
head involved in revocation. In order to have a smaller
MKB, intuitively it is better that any device key is shared
by multiple devices so that one encryption in the MKB can
enable multiple devices. On the other hand, the efﬁciency
of a traitor tracing scheme is measured by how many tests
(or recovered pirated copies) it takes in order to identify
traitors. To enable faster tracing, intuitively one wants the
devices to share as few keys with other devices as possible.
As one can see, the goal to achieve efﬁcient tracing and
efﬁcient revocation seem to be conﬂicting. Furthermore
defending against the above two attacks demands differ-
ent types of tracing. In fact the state-of-art trace-revoke
scheme
[6] for clone attack achieves good revocation
but not efﬁcient tracing on clone devices, while the trace-
revoke scheme [12] for anonymous attack achieves good
traceability but not as efﬁcient on revocation.
Unfortunately in order to provide complete protection
for both attacks, a content protection system has to deploy
both schemes. For example, the Advanced Access Content
System (AACS)[1], the new industry content protection
standard for Blu-ray high-deﬁnition-video opticial discs,
contains the state-of-the-art broadcast encryption [6] and
tracing traitors technology [12]. As one can imagine, the
weakness on traceability and revocation in either scheme
will defeat the system.
In this paper we will present a single trace-revoke
scheme that uniﬁes broadcast encryption and traitor tracing
140
for both attacks. It provides superior efﬁciency for both
traceability and revocation. A content protection system
will now only need to deploy one scheme, a simpler and
more efﬁcient scheme. For that reason AACS has adopted
our uniﬁed system in its “ﬁnal” speciﬁcation.
Although AACS inspired this work, we are more inter-
ested in the general problem. We think that any broadcast-
distribution content protection scheme can be helped by
the concepts in this paper. Scientiﬁcally the design of our
uniﬁed system sheds new insights and should open new
research directions on designing trace-revoke schemes that
are efﬁcient for both tracing and revocation, as well as
defending two attacks in a uniﬁed way.
In rest of the paper, in Section II we will overview the
state-of-art and practice broadcast encryption and traitor
tracing technology and their drawbacks. We will summa-
rize the main contributions of this paper in Section III and
point out its many advantages over the current system. We
will present our uniﬁed system in Section IV. In Section V
we will show how our uniﬁed system can be used for traitor
tracing for both clone attack and anonymous attack in
the same way and greatly improves traceabilities for both
attacks. We will present two tracing schemes, one dynamic
and the other semi-static, and analyze their traceabilities.
Our new system reduces the tracing time from tens of years
to hours. In Appendix we will show security proof and
some experimental results.
II. Current state-of-art and practice
Our work is highly inspired by real world applications
like AACS. While there exist much work on public key
based broadcast encryption [7], the very small storage
available to store the device keys for content protection
makes any public key based scheme impractical to use.
The current state-of-art symmetric key based broadcast
encryption scheme is the subset difference based “NNL
scheme” [6], after the scheme’s authors. The current state-
of-art and practice of a trace-and-revoke scheme for re-
broadcasting attack is the “JL scheme” shown in [12],
after the scheme’s authors. Both schemes are deployed in
AACS.
A. NNL scheme: A revoke-trace scheme for
clone attack
Let D be the set of devices and K be the set of device
keys. Every device d ∈ D owns a subset of keys, denoted
by Kd. Similarly, associated with every key k ∈ K is a set
of users Dk = {d ∈ D : k ∈ Kd}. The NNL scheme [6]
organizes the devices as the leaves of a tree and its subset
difference based device key assignment provides the most
concise MKB.

Fig. 1. Dynamic Tracing algorithm
The goal of NNL tracing algorithm for a clone attack
is either identify a traitor by detecting its compromised
device keys, or create a MKB that the clone device cannot
decrypt (i.e., the clone decoder is disabled). In a black box
tracing algorithm, the only means to diagnosis traitors is to
submit tests, also referred to as forensic MKBs, to the clone
and observe its response. The structure of a forensic MKB
is quite simple: we disable certain keys by encrypting a
random bit string instead of the media key. The remaining
keys are said to be enabled. Based on the keys inside the
clone, the clone may or may not play the content, giving
tracing agency information on which keys are inside the
clone. The tracing in subset cover based schemes relies on
two things:
1) Bifurcation property: for every key k ∈ K such that
|Dk| > 1, there exists keys k1 and k2 such that Dk1∪
Dk2 = Dk and Dk1 ∩ Dk2 = ∅. With this, we can
replace k with k1 and k2 and still cover the same
set of devices.
2) subset tracing procedure: given a set of keys F , ﬁnds
at least one key in F owned by the clone device.
The tracing algorithm maintains a covering of all legit-
imate devices F . The algorithm proceeds by repeatedly
identifying a compromised key k ∈ F, removing it, and
adding to F k1 and k2 satisfying the bifurcation property.
If |Dk| = 1 then the single device in Dk is a traitor. This
process is reiterated (see Figure 1) until the clone box is
unable to play the MKB associated with F.
The efﬁciency of this type of tracing is mainly measured
by how many forensic MKBs are totally needed to com-
plete tracing. That number for NNL tracing is O(T 3logT )
where T is the number of colluding traitors involved in
clone attack.
The above polynomial result seems to be satisfactory
on paper. But it is not a practical solution. The measures
taken by the clone might slow down the testing process.
For example, each test might take 1 minute to ﬁnish. For
a clone device comprising 100 key sets (T = 100), the
polynomial results require over 100 million individual tests
against the clone, which converts to 15 years’ tracing time.
Since time-to-respond to attacks is crucial, the signiﬁcant
tracing time may translate to expensive high-performance
parallelized hardware for testing.
B. JL scheme: A trace-revoke scheme for
anonymous attack
As mentioned earlier, the pirates may choose to re-
distribute the per-content encrypting (media key) or the
decrypted plain content. In this type of anonymous attack,
traitor tracing schemes need to distribute different versions
of the content or encrypting keys to different devices. The
current state-of-art and practice traitor tracing scheme for
anonymous attack is the JL scheme shown in [12].
In the JL scheme, in order to economically prepare
different versions of content for different users, the content
owner chooses various points in the content and creates
variations at those points. Each variation is not only differ-
ently watermarked, but more importantly also differently
encrypted. Each device receives the same augmented con-
tent but can only decrypt one variation at each augmented
segment. In other words, devices play back the content
through different paths. This effectively creates different
content versions. To avoid a big number of variations at any
chosen point, JL scheme uses two levels of assignment as
shown in [10]. An “inner code” is used to assign variations
within each content, eg, a movie; an “outer code” is used
to assign movie versions over a sequence of movies. What
is relevant to the discussion in rest of the paper is that
each movie comes with different version and each version
is differently encrypted. Every device has only one key to
decrypt one version for each movie. The keys link to movie
versions are called tracing keys (dubbed as sequence keys
in AACS).
Each device is assigned a set of tracing keys from a
large matrix. The columns correspond to the movies in
the sequence; the rows correspond to different versions
for each movie. For example, the matrix might be 255 by
256. In a sequence of 255 movies, each movie has 256
movie versions. Each device is assigned exactly one key
from each column, 255 in totals. Each key is one of the
256 versions.
When recovering a sequence of pirated movies, the
license agency expects to detect traitors by linking the
recovered versions to the devices who were originally
assigned those versions. The JL scheme employs an ef-
ﬁcient coalition detection algorithm [11] that only needs
to recover approximately O(T ) number of pirated movies
in order to detect traitors in a coalition of size T . The algo-

rithm tries to ﬁnd the smallest coalition that can explain the
all recovered movies/keys and can incriminate traitors if
the probability of them being framed by larger coalition is
negligibly small. We will use this same coalition detection
algorithm as a basic step in our new uniﬁed semi-static
tracing scheme in Section V-C.
JL scheme also allows revocation of a set of compro-
mised tracing keys and supports multi-time tracing when
new attacks arise. Similar to an MKB (media key block)
that has been used to revoke device keys in a broadcast
encryption scheme, one can use a TKB (tracing key block)
to revoke tracing keys. The only difference is that the JL
scheme has more than one correct K, (called variant data
in AACS), one for each version of the content. Figure
2 shows an example of an TKB with sample encrypted
in the cell. The cells marked ”X” is
variant data Ki
revoked, some garbage data is encrypted in those cells.
Each compliant device uses its valid tracing key indirectly
to decrypt the TKB and obtains a valid variant data from
some column. The revoking device will get garbage after
processing all the columns in the TKB.
However, as shown in [12], since one TKB can output
multiple valid variant data, if the attackers combine the re-
voked keys with the keys that have not been detected, there
are multiple paths to obtain the same valid variant data. As
a result, recovering one variant data does not gain as much
as information as before. Indeed the q variations now has to
spread over c columns. Each column only effectively gets
q/c variations. It is clear that traceability degrades when
the effective q decreases. When the number of columns c
becomes big enough, the traceability degrades so low that
it becomes untraceable. The scheme is overwhelmed and
broken in that case. As shown in [12], that puts a limit
on the revocation capability of the scheme. Indeed it has a
ﬁnite revocation capability and traceability degrades with
revocations.

system
