# Appendix B: Evaluation Cases

Our evaluation reveals that some devices exhibit a better security posture than others. In this section, we analyze three devices, categorizing them based on their overall security assessment. The categories are: Good, Satisfactory, and Needs Improvement, which highlight both good security practices and areas for improvement.

## A. Good: Withings Home

### Functional Features
The Withings Home device is a camera equipped with an air quality sensor. It includes a mobile companion application, integrates with cloud endpoints, and communicates over the Internet and the local network. The device exposes mDNS service, enabling zero-configuration protocols (e.g., Appleâ€™s Bonjour) to find and configure it. Initial configuration uses Bluetooth, followed by IP communication. Device updates require user consent.

### Assessment
- **mDNS Service**: No issues were found.
- **Mobile Application**: Utilizes secure storage for sensitive data, employs cryptographic protocols, and has appropriate permission provisioning.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Self-hosted by Nokia, enabling user notifications and control.
- **Network Communication**: Full encryption between device-to-cloud, app-to-cloud, and app-to-device, mitigating MITM attacks.
- **Clear-Text Authentication**: The device authenticates in clear-text over the Internet to associate with the cloud management interface (XMPP server).

## B. Satisfactory: Nest Cam

### Functional Features
The Nest Cam is an indoor camera that detects motion, records video, and notifies users of activities. It requires forced configuration via the mobile application using Bluetooth and a PIN/barcode. All activities and controls operate through cloud endpoints. Device updates are automatic, ensuring the latest firmware.

### Assessment
- **Client Model**: No exposed services, reducing attack vectors.
- **Certificate Pinning**: Ensures secure device-to-cloud communication.
- **Mobile Application**: Manages all Nest products, requesting access to microphone, camera/photos, geolocation, and other sensitive services.
- **Internet Dependency**: Without Internet access, the device is inaccessible.
- **Google DNS**: Forcibly uses Google DNS, ignoring DHCP configurations on the local network. Static routes can be configured on the gateway to redirect DNS traffic.

## C. Needs Improvement: MiCasa Verde VeraLite

### Functional Features
The VeraLite is a smart-home Z-Wave controller that monitors and controls low-energy sensors and other devices. It pairs through a cloud portal using a pre-printed PIN. Manual updates are required, but the device notifies users of new updates. The device exposes web, DNS, UPnP, and SSH servers. The mobile application requests excessive permissions, such as calling, controlling phone network state, and camera access. The VeraLite is a discontinued product.

### Assessment
- **Hardened Mode**: Disables many running services, but they are enabled by default.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Multiple exploitable vulnerabilities, as shown in Table VIII.
  - **UPnP Services**: Uses a vulnerable version of the libupnp library.
  - **SSH Services**: Uses a vulnerable dropbear (2016.72) implementation.
  - **Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) Mode**: Supports 3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, and aes256-cbc, which can be exploited to recover plaintext from ciphertext.
  - **DNS Service**: Allows queries for third-party domains without recursion, enabling DNS cache snooping.
- **Mobile Application**: Requires account creation with the Vera vendor.
- **Security Issues**:
  - No certificate pinning, making it susceptible to MITM attacks.
  - Clear-text authentication on cloud endpoints.
  - Exploitable services and exposure of sensitive information.
  - Unsupported operating systems.

| Verda         | High   | CVE-2012-0920                                                                                              |
| VeraLite      | Critical| CVE-2016-7406, CVE-2016-7407                                                                               |
| Wink 2        | High   | CVE-2016-7408                                                                                              |
