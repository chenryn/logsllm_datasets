User: Please briefly introduce the functions and differences between NAT and routers.
Assistant: NAT (Network Address Translation) is a network address translation technology that allows multiple devices to share a public IP address. NAT maps the private IP address inside the LAN to the public IP address, and then converts the public IP address back to the private IP address when the data packet is sent out. A router is a network device that forwards data packets from one network interface to another to connect different networks. Routers can route data packets, improve network reliability and security, and perform network management and monitoring. The main difference between NAT and router lies in their different functions. NAT is mainly used for IP address translation, while router is used for forwarding and routing of data packets. A router can have the function of NAT, but NAT cannot replace a router. When there are multiple devices in the local area network that need to connect to the external network, the data packets need to be routed to the external network through a router. If multiple devices need to use the same public IP address, address translation needs to be performed through NAT.
