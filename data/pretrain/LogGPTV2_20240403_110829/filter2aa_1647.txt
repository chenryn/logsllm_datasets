Bringing Processor Firmware up to Code
Bio
Matt (a.k.a. Syncsrc)
●
Recovering EE / CompE
●
Builder and user of hardware debug features
●
Uses “BIOS” and “UEFI” interchangeably
●
Currently responsible for platform security of a cloud
●
Religiously updates firmware
●
Formerly a product security validation lead at Intel
Background
Background - Patches for Spectre & Meltdown
●
Meltdown
○
PTI (Linux), KVA Shadow (Windows)
●
Spectre v1
○
Lfence (forced serialization)
●
Spectre v2
○
Retpoline (“pollutes” BTB) - An incomplete fix, per Intel
○
IBRS & IBPB (new MSRs to control BTB)
○
Microcode updates are necessary to expose these new MSRs
What is Microcode?
●
Can be thought of as “Processor Firmware”
○
A Brief History of Microprogramming
●
Can be patched to fix bugs & errata
○
However, processors don’t have any non-volatile storage
○
Any applied patches are lost on reset or power-down
●
Stored and applied by the BIOS or Operating System
○
Reloaded on every boot, reset, S3 resume, etc...
○
Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures SDM Volume 3A, section 9.11.6
Obtaining Microcode Patches
●
From BIOS Updates
○
MacBook and Surface users are covered
●
From Operating System Updates
○
Linux: redistributed by most distros (via microcode_ctl.rpm or intel-microcode.deb)
■
Users can also download microcode.dat directly from Intel
○
Microsoft didn’t start distributing microcode until 2 months after it was released
■
Still only distributing for some processor and Windows versions
●
Patches existed, but were impossible to apply to many systems
Systems Unable to Patch Spectre
●
Still no way to mitigate Spectre v2 on millions of systems
○
Other than buying a new OS (or a new computer)
●
Windows PCs that are 3 to 9 years old *
○
Mostly shipped with Windows 7 or 8 pre-installed
○
BIOS updates delayed or unavailable
●
3rd-party microcode update drivers are ineffective
* CPUs more than 9 years old are not receiving microcode updates from Intel

Are there any other options?
●
When can microcode patches be applied?
○
BIOS - users can’t modify
○
OS - microcode drivers run too late
○
Bootloader - maybe?
●
No existing EFI utility to load microcode 
○
TianoCore is open source though
○
And already has code that applies microcode updates
○
How hard could it be?
Uload.efi
●
Built using EDK2
●
Mostly code appropriated from MicrocodeUpdateDxe
○
Made into an EFI shell app
●
Loads microcode to all Processors/Threads
Inserting Uload into EFI Boot
●
POST: Power On Stuff That-happens
●
Determine bootloader from NVRAM variables
●
Locate boot drive & partition
○
Involves UUIDs somehow
●
Run Bootloader (eg: bootx64.efi, shim.efi)
○
Bootloader is just an EFI application, it can be replaced
●
Bootloader launches kernel
Micro-Renovator
●
Script to automatically update EFI boot partition
○
Runs from a Linux Live CD
●
Finds EFI partition and bootloader
○
Copies microcode and Uload.efi to the boot partition
○
Installs Shell.efi and sets as the primary boot option
○
On boot, startup script runs Uload prior to the OS bootloader

Limitations
●
Breaks Sleep (S3)
○
Hibernation still works
●
No secure boot support (yet)
●
Occasional inconsistent behavior after booting into Windows
●
Microsoft appears to be actively reverting the changes made by earlier 
versions of MicroRenovator
Summary
●
Firmware patching is an unsolved problem
○
UEFI should have made things better, but didn’t
●
Component vendors needs to focus on enabling patching for end-users
○
Not system builders (they aren’t incentivized)
○
IoT and Mobile spaces have the same issue
●
It shouldn’t take bootloader hacks to apply security patches to operating 
systems that are still under support
