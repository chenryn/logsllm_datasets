vation. This ﬁgure shows the best Alembic can perform given
the sparse nature of the DNS resolutions for the domains in
DZ .
result is important as the effectiveness of Alembic depends on
the frequency of DNS resolutions for a domain. Speciﬁcally,
Alembic requires at least W/2 observation days before and
after the candidate date. In other words,
the span of the
observation window depends on the resolution frequency of the
domain. At a minimum, the window may span W consecutive
days, i.e., the domain saw a DNS resolution on all W days. In
the worst case, the domain may only be resolved once over our
dataset’s collection period. As mentioned above, we cap the
date range necessary to collect W days of resolution behavior
at 120 days. We show the date range of the observation window
with respect to the number of days away from an exact match
in Figure 7. In total, we ﬁnd 4,543 (25.5%) of all changes
fall within an Alembic observation window. Encouragingly,
the bulk of these ownership change events occurred within ten
days of an observation (red line in Figure 7)—even for larger
observation ranges.
We believe our algorithm is a necessary step towards
fostering additional research into domain ownership changes.
Furthermore, our results show that Alembic, which works
without relying on archiving and parsing WHOIS records,
identiﬁes potential changes in ownership. We plan to improve
and reﬁne Alembic to account for multiple ownership changes
and sparsity in the input DNS data. For the latter, we propose
investigation into the relationship between the frequency of
resolutions for a domain and the span of the observation
window required to detect ownership changes. Finally, we plan
to explore other detection signals to use as component scores.
D. Additional Discoveries Using Alembic
We used Alembic to help identify abuses of both positive
and negative residual trust. Here we discuss examples that fall
into each of these categories. For the former, we highlight
previously benign domains which were later used for command
and control (C&C), leveraging the domain’s historic reputation

to exploit whitelisting. For negative residual trust, we highlight
a potential attack vector whereby a leftover domain from a
state-sponsored threat could be used to trivially gain access to
sensitive networks where an infection has already occurred.
1) Abuse of Positive Residual Trust: Here we study cases
where Alembic helped identify cases of positive residual trust
abuse. We present a brief look at two of the 263,847 domain
names that were located by Alembic and subsequently became
malicious only after expiring.
First we look at doctorcompany.net. After expiration,
malware began using this domain for command and control
(C&C). Anti-virus analysis from VirusTotal suggests this par-
ticular malware was variant of Win32/Polif [3] (a.k.a. Symmi).
This particular threat is capable of numerous malicious ac-
tivities including downloading and executing arbitrary ﬁles,
logging keystrokes and other sensitive data, and exﬁltrating
any stolen information.
Using available historic WHOIS data, we estimate that
doctorcompany.net changed owners once between 2008
and 2014. As shown in Table VI, the new owner chose to use
an identity protection service when registering the domain,
a common tactic used to by both legitimate and malicious
users to exclude personal information from WHOIS records.
Throughout the second lifetime of the domain and until its
expiration—listed in the WHOIS record as February 7, 2014—
the domain used the same nameservers, suggesting the owner
remained the same during that year. We conﬁrmed the domain
became available for registration again on April 29, 2014—
81 days after the listed expiry date and long enough to
have passed through the entire expiration process described
in Section II. About a month later on May 25, 2014, we
saw malicious binaries attempting to query this domain. Since
this domain had approximately six years of history without
abuse, subsequent use by malware beneﬁted from the domain’s
positive residual trust.
Similarly, clicky.info was also used for malware
command and control (C&C) only after domain expiration. AV
analysis suggests this particular malware sample is a variant of
Win32/Nivdort [14], a trojan that steals key-presses, browsing
history, credit card information and user-names and passwords.
Using historic WHOIS, the domain’s ownership appears to
have changed eight
times over the course of eight years.
A summary appears in Table VII. Using historic WHOIS,
we were able to conﬁrm this domain was in pending delete
status on February 11, 2014, and we subsequently conﬁrmed
its expiration on February 13, 2014 using the techniques
mentioned in Section IV-A. As seen in Table VII, it was
subsequently seen re-registered on March 9, 2014. The ﬁrst
observed communication by malware to this domain occurred

TABLE VII: Ownership changes to clicky.info
on March 15, 2014—less than a week after being re-registered.
Consequently, malware using this domain is able to leverage
almost eight years of positive residual trust.
The WHOIS data for clicky.info shown in Table VII
also highlights that that ownership changes are not always
preceded by an expiration (domain registrations typically last
at least one year). This further motivates the need for an
algorithm like Alembic that helps locate ownership changes
and illustrates the need for better awareness around the abuse
of residual trust in domains.
2) Abuse of Negative Residual Trust: Next, we highlight
a potential attack vector that leverages expired APT domains.
On June 9, 2014 the security company CrowdStrike publicly
released a report [2] detailing the cyber espionage activity
of PLA Unit 61486. Also known as PUTTER PANDA, Unit
61486 is a branch of the Chinese SIGINT community.4 Their
mission, according to CrowdStrike, is to steal the trade secrets
of corporations in the satellite, aerospace, and communication
industries.
CrowdStrike’s report identiﬁes Chen Ping, as the primary
persona responsible for obtaining domains for Unit 61486’s
C&C infrastructure. This moniker was derived from the reg-
istrant email stored in the WHOIS records, cpyy.chen-
@gmail.com. We leveraged this knowledge to identify us-
reports.net, an expired domain in our dataset that was
previously registered using Chen Ping’s email. We reanimated
the domain, pointed it to a sinkhole, and found that despite
being expired for years (and Unit 61486’s activities being
publicized in high-proﬁle white-papers) our sinkhole began
receiving connection attempts, every three seconds, from a
national government research lab in Taiwan.
It follows that any malicious party with knowledge of the
C&C protocol can capitalize on expired C&C domains to gain
entry into already compromised networks—all for the low
price of domain registration. This raises an important question:
Should domains be available for re-registration after they were
previously used for malicious purposes? We discuss this issue
more in the following section.
VI. DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL REMEDIES
Throughout this study, we have highlighted malicious re-
trust as the root cause of many
registration and residual
seemingly disparate security problems. In Section III, we

outlined several attacks and security lapses made possible
by the abuse of this residual trust. Current solutions only
address the symptoms of the underlying problem, not
the
cause, resulting in a plethora of techniques that only address
narrow avenues of abuse. Instead, these problems would be
better solved by addressing the underlying abuse vector.
In this section, we discuss potential remedies, both non-
technical and technical, for residual trust abuse. Unfortunately,
there is no single solution that can completely solve the
problem; instead, a comprehensive remedy necessitates discus-
sion and cooperation between all affected stakeholders. Our
analysis of remedies is intended to outline the challenging
nature of the problem with the hope it will foster further
investigation by the security community.
A. Non-Technical Remedies
While any domain may carry residual trust, the severity of
potential abuse is much greater for certain types of domains,
e.g., those previously used by ﬁnancial institutions or critical
infrastructure. In short, domains that affect large numbers of
users and systems, if abused, would beneﬁt more from greater
protections than other less important domains.
One potential remedy is to restrict critical industries to
specially regulated zones. The idea is to limit who can register
expired domains from one of these protected zones. Indeed,
we already see this type of behavior with zones like gov
and edu. Unfortunately, there are several unresolved questions
and challenges with this solution. First, what criteria must
be met for a domain to be considered critical? Second, how
do we identify the existing critical domains? Third, assuming
such domains could be identiﬁed, how do we migrate each
domain from its existing zone? Finally, who is responsible
for creating and managing the critical zones? These questions
are made even more complicated by the global reach of the
Internet; many diverse organizations (with different goals and
motivations) would need to reach a consensus before any
global solution could be adopted.
Rather than rely on custom zones, another potential option
is to have the registrars or registries enforce special registration
policies for critical domains. This solution is attractive as it
could provide protection to critical domains under all zones
and not simply those under a special top-level domain. How-
ever, this requires identiﬁcation and reporting of all critical
domains to either the registrars or registries and, for many
organizations, this could be a challenging task. It also does
not solve the problem of which domains qualify for protected
registrations. This solution may be further complicated by
the fact that any solution involving the registrars or registries
also presumes that they would be willing participants. Given
their ﬁnancial interest in selling domains, there is a strong
possibility that they would be reticent to employ any policies
that make domain registration more cumbersome.
The previous two solutions focus on identifying critical do-
mains; however, such solutions do not address the case where
a non-critical domain is used as a trust anchor. For example, in
Section III-B we saw how email addresses for expired domains
were used for account management, thereby opening up the
possibility for an attacker to hijack the account using malicious
re-registration. For these domains, non-technical remedies need

to be augmented with technical ones; we will discuss a couple
such options in detail below.
B. Technical Remedies
When non-technical remedies fail, a technical solution is
needed to mitigate problems. There are innumerable services
that rely on third party domains, either for infrastructure or
from users, and it is unlikely that many of these domains would
ﬁt some strict deﬁnition of a critical domain. As such, the non-
technical policies proposed above would not be sufﬁcient.
Instead, these systems should employ some process, such
as Alembic (Section V), for identifying potential ownership
changes. Such changes should be used to expire or revise the
inherent residual trust of the associated domains. For instance,
systems that rely on e-mail should re-evaluate access policies
when e-mails expire or change ownership. A ﬁrewall rule that
whitelists a domain should be revised to reclassify domains
in order to avoid missing new attacks. A security information
and event management (SIEM) device that classiﬁes a domain
as “low risk/spam/click-fraud/SEO” may revise the scoring
of domains that have changed ownership. Given the active
role of expired domains in APT attacks, this recommendation
applies equally to forensic analysts and those investigating
post-compromise events.
For smaller numbers of domains, it may be possible to use
WHOIS to identify when the residual trust of domains should
be re-evaluated, but this will not scale due to the complexities
of bulk WHOIS collection. Furthermore, the lack of consistent
formatting, use of privacy protection services, and inconsistent
veriﬁcation of WHOIS data may cause inferences relying on
it to be unreliable. A system like Alembic could be used
to address some of those concerns. In particular, it could be
used to help identify ownership changes when scaling WHOIS
becomes untenable, and since it relies on underlying network
properties, it may ﬁnd ownership changes that would be missed
in WHOIS due to unreliable or forged data.
Dealing with residual trust is a challenging problem, but
ignoring it exposes users and systems to a host of security
issues. A comprehensive solution for this problem will require
additional research and discussion by the security community.
VII. RELATED WORK
There has been a wealth of research focused on using
DNS as a tool for detecting malicious behavior. For example,
researchers have previously used elements of DNS to classify
malicious websites [37], [23]. Other researchers have used
DNS information to understand and predict future malicious
behavior [42], [43], [27], [29] and identify previously unknown
malicious domains [19], [17], [18], [51], [40], [41]. In addition
to using DNS for prediction and detection of malicious in-
frastructure, other work has focused on protecting the domain
name system itself from abuse [25], [20]. Even commercial
entities frequently use DNS-based tools to help protect against
known malicious domains through the use of blacklists [46].
Our understanding of expired domain abuse ﬁrst came from
early research into the fate of failed banking domains by Moore
and Clayton [39]. Their study focused on expired ﬁnancial
sites and found some instances where old, failed bank web
sites were re-registered and likely used for nefarious purposes.
However, the study authors were narrowly focused on methods
for detecting failed banking domains.
Unlike this previous work, we study how residual trust—
implicitly transferred between owners of a domain name—
affects the security of systems and entities that rely on DNS.
Our multi-year study demonstrates that residual trust abuse is
being actively exploited and the problem is growing. Further,
our work shows that this phenomenon impacts prior work by
the security community and, thereby, demonstrates the need for
more research into residual trust and malicious re-registrations.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Domains can change ownership for many reasons (e.g.,
expirations, auction, transfers) and the remaining residual trust
is abused by clever attackers hoping to evade whitelists, hijack
accounts, exploit software systems, or even buy access to
existing infections. In short, we ﬁnd that residual trust abuse
is the root cause of many security issues on the Internet. At
its core, there are potential policy and technical remedies.
Policy remedies could identify potential avenues for exploiting
residual domain trust and prevent or police re-registrations
as appropriate. When that fails,
technical remedies should
actively try to identify ownership changes; we propose one
such algorithm, Alembic.
Using a dataset of 179,326,265 expired domains spanning
from December 2008 to July 2015, we quantify and character-
ize residual trust abuse and malicious re-registration. We found
that 385,741 expired domains were contacted by malware or
appeared on a public blacklist. This intersection contained
almost a third, 101,322 (31.7%), of public blacklists domains
in our dataset, and more troubling, a little over quarter, 27,758
(27.4%), of these domains expired before being blacklisted. In
addition, only 3,327 (1.4%) domains contacted by malware
after expiration ever appeared on a public blacklist. These
ﬁndings demonstrate that the residual trust of expiring domains
is being actively exploited. To make matters worse, we observe
that the number of domains showing up on blacklists after
expiration has grown from 784 between 2009 and 2012 to
over 9,000 domains in 2014 alone; this shows that residual
trust abuse is a growing phenomenon.
In order to help the research community ﬂag poten-
tially dangerous reanimated domain names, we developed
a lightweight algorithm to rank potential domain ownership
changes using only features that can be passively collected
from DNS. We used this algorithm to identify several cases
of residual trust abuse; speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed instances
where re-registered domain names were used as infrastructure
to facilitate attacks and one instance where an expired APT-
related domain name could have been re-registered to gain
access to an overseas government research lab.
