bors that y contributes to v’s neighborhood. This value is
obtained by subtracting the amount of overlap (|N ({v}) ∩
N ({y})|) between the immediate neighborhoods of v and y
from y’s node degree |N ({y})|.
We now describe the details of our approach. First, each
node v computes an expansion contribution score f (v, y) for
each node y ∈ N2({v}) of all its 2-hop neighbors. Second, v
generates a ranked list of at most k of its 2-hop neighbors
with the lowest scores. We thus name our heuristic min-
imum expansion contribution (MinEC). Third, each node v
initiates a 2-hop link request to every node x in v’s ranked
list. Fourth, a 2-hop link (v, x) is created if and only if x is
present is v’s ranked list and vice-versa. For better under-
standing, consider the following example where x receives a
2-hop link request from v. If x has v in its ranked list as well,
x reciprocates the request by creating the 2-hop link (x, v)
which completes the handshake for future communication
512over this link. However, if v is not present in the ranked list
of 2-hop neighbors of x, then the node x would discard the
2-hop link request from v.
The exception to this rule of creating the 2-hop link (x, v)
is that if x is a Sybil node receiving the link request from an
honest node v, the Sybil node x will reciprocate the request
regardless of v’s presence in x’s ranked list. Such a deviation
from the protocol of a 2-hop link creation enables more 2-hop
attack edges to be formed than in the protocol-compliant
scenario, thus playing into the advantage of the adversary.
In essence, the main rationale of MinEC is that, by reward-
ing the number of common neighbors between two nodes v
and y and penalizing their node degrees, the expansion [20]
of each node’s neighborhood is done at a slow rate as k
grows. This enables, with a high probability for a small k, (i)
an honest node to form 2-hop (honest) edges with other hon-
est nodes due to high clustering coeﬃcient typically found
in the social network graphs, and (ii) an honest node to min-
imize the addition of 2-hop (attack) edges with Sybil nodes
since they would contribute to more new Sybil nodes to an
honest node’s neighborhood. From another perspective, the
formation of 2-hop links can be viewed as a variant of the
link prediction problem [19], and the MinEC heuristic is a link
predictor method.
5.3 Analysis
Here, we present the intuition behind our hypothesis and
the choice of k from an analytical perspective.
Creation of 2-hop attack edges. Let a d-regular graph
G = (V, E) be α-expander, i.e., for every subset of nodes
S ⊂ V and |S| < |V |/2, the expansion factor is X(S) =
|N (S)|/|S| ≥ α = Ω(1). The theory on expander graphs [5]
tells us that, for a given set of nodes S ⊂ V , the expansion
factor is X(S) ≥ d/4, when the set S is very small relative
to the size of the graph (|S| << |V |) and the graph’s second
largest eigenvalue is µ = 2
d − 1.

We now put this in the context of our system. Let a graph
G with the above properties represent a large social overlay
network containing a single Sybil node v and the rest are
honest nodes. Then, the system would contain g = d 1-hop
attack edges between v and its immediate neighbors N ({v}).
Let S = {v} ∪ N ({v}) represent the small neighborhood
around v. The expansion factor of S at such a local level [5]
is X(S) = |N (S)|/|S| ≥ d/4 since |S| = d + 1 (<< |V |) for a
large graph. We note that here N (S) = N2({v}), represent-
ing the number of 2-hop neighbors of v. An application of
the naive Two-Hop heuristic would enable v to create a total
of g2 ≥ d + (d + 1)d/4 = O(d2) 2-hop attack edges which
include 1-hop attack edges and the new 2-hop attack edges
with its 2-hop neighbors N2({v}).
