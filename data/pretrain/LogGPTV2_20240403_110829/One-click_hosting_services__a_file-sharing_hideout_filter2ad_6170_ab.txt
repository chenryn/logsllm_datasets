2000kbps, they can do only one concurrent download at a time, the
maximum size of an uploaded Ô¨Åle is no more than 200MB (it used
to be 100MB until recently), 3 there is a mandatory wait time be-
tween successive downloads, etc. To entice users to upload as much
content as possible, RapidShare offers ‚Äúpoints‚Äù to an uploader each
time her content is downloaded. Points, can, in turn, be exchanged
for Premium accounts or extra download capacity. Such incentives
have quickly enabled RapidShare to store a huge variety of songs,
movies, games, software, books and other types of content. Last but
not least, it is important to note that RapidShare is not responsible
for any copyright violations due to illegal Ô¨Åle sharing conducted
using their infrastructure. Uploaders need to declare that the up-
loaded content is not protected by copyright laws, and RapidShare
is further legally protected by not offering any indexing or search
facilities for the content they store.
3. MAIN DATASETS
Table 1 summarizes the main dataset of this study - we refer to
this dataset as our ‚Äúclient-side‚Äù traces. We collected Ô¨Çow traces in
the IPFix format, as well as HTTP packet headers, at two monitor-
ing locations: Monitor1 is the main Internet access link of a Na-
tional Research Network that serves a population of about 10,000
students and academics. Monitor2 is the main Internet access
link of a University campus network of about 1,000 students and
faculty. Both monitoring points are located in Europe and have a
user base composed mostly of university students. One may ar-
gue that these demographics are biased and not general in terms
of age and location. Our analysis, however, focuses on informa-
tion that would not depend, most likely, to these demographics.
Data from Monitor1 cover about 4 months, while the Monitor2 data
cover about 5 months. Table 1 also mentions the total number of
unique client IP addresses that access RapidShare during the mon-
itoring period from each of our monitoring sites. We saw about
750 IP addresses at Monitor1 and 450 IP addresses at Monitor2.
These numbers should be viewed as an upper bound on the number
of actual RapidShare users in the two monitored networks because
some users may be using DHCP. The identiÔ¨Åcation of RapidShare
Ô¨Çows was performed using the HOST header Ô¨Åeld of HTTP re-
quests (searching for the string ‚Äúrapishare.com"). Based on that
data, we could then identify all relevant RapidShare Ô¨Çows in our
traces. We also use some additional datasets that are described later
in the paper, when Ô¨Årst introduced.
4. OCH TRAFFIC VOLUME
In this section we examine the trafÔ¨Åc volume of OCH services,
and of RapidShare in particular, in our client-side traces. We com-
pare the trafÔ¨Åc volume that these services generate with Web and
BitTorrent trafÔ¨Åc, as well as with major video streaming services.
As shown in Table 1, in Monitor1 OCH services generate 3.32%
of the total trafÔ¨Åc volume. This is low compared to BitTorrent traf-
Ô¨Åc (44.5%) but a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction (25%) of the total HTTP trafÔ¨Åc
(12.8%). The fraction of OCH trafÔ¨Åc is signiÔ¨Åcantly lower in Mon-
itor2. Figure 2 shows the aggregate trafÔ¨Åc rate downloaded from all
OCH services in hourly intervals (the curve for Monitor2 includes
5 more months of data). 4 The hourly rates vary widely and, even
though the long-term average is only about 1Mbps in either mon-
itor, the hourly OCH rate often reaches up to 10-20Mbps, which
3To overcome this Ô¨Åle size limit, uploaders partition large objects
in Ô¨Åles of that size and share them through several URLs.

is signiÔ¨Åcant compared to the total trafÔ¨Åc rate in these traces. We
were hoping to see a clear trend in this timeseries, but this is not
the case even in the 9-month period covered in Monitor2.
RapidShare generates more than 80% of the OCH trafÔ¨Åc volume
in our traces; so, in the rest of this paper we focus on this particular
OCH service. Figure 3 compares the average daily download rate
of RapidShare with two popular video streaming sites: YouTube
(www.youtube.com) and GoogleVideo (googlevideo.com).
Note that RapidShare generates more (Monitor1) or comparable
(Monitor2) trafÔ¨Åc volume than these major content providers.
Finally, Figure 4 shows the hourly trafÔ¨Åc rate for Web and OCH
trafÔ¨Åc during a randomly selected week in September 2008 at Mon-
itor1. Note that OCH trafÔ¨Åc follows a similar diurnal pattern with
Web trafÔ¨Åc: much less activity during the evening hours and week-
ends. Afterall, OCH can be viewed as just another Web service.
5. CHARACTERIZATION OF RAPIDSHARE
CLIENTS
In this section, we focus on the characteristics of RapidShare
clients that are active in our two university traces. As mentioned
in Table 1, an upper bound for the number of RapidShare clients
during the course of our study is around 750 for Monitor1 and 450
for Monitor2.
5.1 Flow sizes and client downloads
First, we analyze the Ô¨Çow sizes downloaded by RapidShare clients.
Figure 5 shows the CDF of the download Ô¨Çow sizes for all Rapid-
Share connections. 50% of the Ô¨Çows are smaller than 700B at Mon-
itor1 and 7KB at Monitor2, while 90% of the Ô¨Çows are smaller than
150KB at both monitors. Since most Ô¨Åles provided by RapidShare
are typically several megabytes long, these smaller Ô¨Çows proba-
bly correspond to Web page accesses, failed/stopped downloads or
Web page refreshes to see the remaining wait time until the next
download can start. The remaining 10% of the Ô¨Çows, which trans-
fer more than 150KB, are probably actual downloads from Rapid-
Share. In the rest of the paper we use a threshold of 150KB to dis-
tinguish between ‚Äúcontent download Ô¨Çows‚Äù (larger) and ‚Äúbrowsing
Ô¨Çows‚Äù (smaller). As shown in Figure 5, the CDF increases slowly
after 100KB or so, meaning that the identiÔ¨Åcation of content down-
load Ô¨Çows should be robust to the selection of this threshold.
Figure 6 shows the complementary CDF (C-CDF) of content
download Ô¨Çow sizes. Up to the point of 100MB, Ô¨Çow sizes appear
to be Pareto distributed, as probably expected. For larger Ô¨Çows we

note two signiÔ¨Åcant drops, one at 100MB and another at 200MB.
These sizes correspond to the maximum upload Ô¨Åle size limits that
RapidShare enforces for free uploaders: this limit was 100MB and
was increased to 200MB in October‚Äô08. Premium users, on the
other hand, can download and upload Ô¨Åles up to 2GB. The dif-
ference between the two distributions for Ô¨Åles larger than 200MB
implies that there are much fewer Premium users at Monitor1 than
at Monitor2.
Next, we examine the number of daily content downloads per
user (or client). We assume that a client uses the same IP address
during the day, and so the daily downloads from the same IP ad-
dress are interpreted as downloads from the same user. Most clients
perform more than one download per day (57% of clients at Mon-
itor2), and only 23% of clients perform more than 10 downloads
in the same day. Note that large objects (movies, software, etc) are
often split into 100MB or 200MB Ô¨Åles, and so a large number of
consecutive Ô¨Çows by the same user may correspond to download-
ing different parts of the same object. Figure 7 shows the C-CDF
of the daily number of content download Ô¨Çows per client at Moni-
tor2. This empirical distribution can be approximated by a Pareto
distribution with shape parameter 0.66. This low value of the shape
parameter implies extremely large variability, to the point that nei-
ther the variance nor the mean of the underlying distribution are
well-deÔ¨Åned. The C-CDF for Monitor1 is similar.
5.2 Premium vs. Free users
As previously mentioned, RapidShare supports two user types:
Free and Premium. All content is available to both types and the
Figure 5: CDF of RapidShare download Ô¨Çow sizes at the two
monitors.
main difference is that the former are limited in terms of their up-
load Ô¨Çow sizes, concurrent downloads, and download throughput.
RapidShare reports that the download throughput of Free users is
throttled to 200-2000kbps. In this section we attempt to identify
Premium users based on their download throughput, assuming that
content download Ô¨Çows that receive more than 2Mbps are gener-
ated by Premium users. Of course, we may underestimate the num-
ber of such users when their throughput is limited by their access
link capacity or by Internet congestion, and not by RapidShare.
Figure 8 shows the distribution of the average download rate per
user observed on a daily basis. The rates were calculated consid-
ering only content downloads Ô¨Çows. Almost all users at Monitor1
( 95%) and more than 80% of users at Monitor2 experience an av-
erage throughput that is less than 2Mbps, suggesting that most of
them are Free users. At Monitor2, the remaining 20% (5% for
Monitor1) of the users enjoy throughput up to 14Mbps and they
must be Premium customers. Though, the percentage of Premium
users is not very large, and may vary based on the user demograph-
ics and geographic location, it is important to note that there exists a
signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of users willing to pay a fee to use a service that
is also offered for free, as long as they can enjoy some ‚Äúpremium
features‚Äù.5
5The artful reader may argue that cracked or phished Premium ac-
counts are sometimes available. On the other hand, RapidShare can
detect and block these accounts as easily as a typical user can locate
and use them.

5.3 File popularity
Here, we examine the Ô¨Åles shared by RapidShare clients in our
client-side traces. Due to privacy concerns, we limit our analysis
to the number of unique Ô¨Åles, ignoring the actual Ô¨Ålenames. We
further examine the type of content shared using RapidShare in
Section 8. Note that the same content object (a movie or a song,
for instance) can be stored as several different Ô¨Åles in RapidShare
(aliases). The following analysis focuses on the popularity of in-
dividual Ô¨Åles, not of the underlying content. We should Ô¨Årst note
that we only focus on Ô¨Åle popularity as seen at our two monitoring
sites. Obviously, we cannot make any statements about the popu-
larity distribution of different Ô¨Åles in a wider scale. Our main focus
is to examine whether caching RapidShare content close to clients
would make sense or not.
Figure 9 shows the popularity of each Ô¨Åle as the number of clients
that downloaded that Ô¨Åle in our traces. More than 75% of the Ô¨Åles
were downloaded only once. The inner plot focuses on the distri-
bution of the most popular Ô¨Åles. Very few Ô¨Åles are highly popular
among the clients of each monitor; less than 0.05% of the Ô¨Åles were
downloaded more than Ô¨Åve times, and only a handful of Ô¨Åles were
downloaded more than ten times. These results suggest that there
would be little beneÔ¨Åt to cache RapidShare Ô¨Åles close to clients,
arguing in favor of a centralized infrastructure where all servers re-
side at the same location. Indeed, as the next section shows, this
appears to be the case with RapidShare. Also, this Ô¨Åle popular-
ity distribution makes RapidShare very different than traditional
CDNs that rely heavily on caching popular Web objects close to
clients and that maintain cache hit rates of more than 90% [2, 12].
5.4 Summary
This section performed a characterization of RapidShare client
behavior using client-side traces from two university networks. Our
results show that more than half of the clients perform more than
one Ô¨Åle download per day. These downloads are mostly performed
by non-paying users, who experience download throughput up to
2Mbps. However, a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of users (around 12%) is
willing to pay a small fee to get a better service. The premium
users seen in our client-side traces experience download through-
put up to 14Mbps (i.e. downloading a 200MB Ô¨Åle in less than 2
minutes). The users‚Äô daily activity mainly involves downloading a
small number of Ô¨Åles, which often corresponds to a single media
object.
In terms of trafÔ¨Åc patterns, even though RapidShare can be viewed
as just another Web service, the popularity of unique Ô¨Åles down-
loaded by its clients differs signiÔ¨Åcantly from that of traditional
Web browsing. We observed only a small number of Ô¨Åles be-
ing downloaded more than once during the whole monitoring pe-
riod. This suggests that caching RapidShare content close to clients
would offer little or no beneÔ¨Åt.
6. SERVICE ARCHITECTURE
In this section we attempt to understand the RapidShare archi-
tecture based on information from our client-side traces as well as
from active measurements. In particular, we explore the number
of deployed servers, their network connectivity, geographical loca-
tion, load balancing and content replication strategies.
