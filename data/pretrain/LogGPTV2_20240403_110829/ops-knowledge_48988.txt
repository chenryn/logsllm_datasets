User: Please demonstrate how to use Ansible automation tool to configure and deploy Docker containers
Assistant: The following are the basic steps to configure and deploy Docker containers: 1. Install Ansible First, you need to install the Ansible automation tool. On Ubuntu, you can use the following command to install: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ansible ``` 2. Prepare Ansible host On the Ansible host, you need to install Docker-related Ansible modules. On Ubuntu, you can use the following commands to install: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install python-pip sudo pip install docker-py ``` 3. Write Ansible Playbook An example Ansible Playbook is as follows: ``` - hosts : localhost gather_facts: no tasks: - name: start nginx container docker_container: name: nginx image: nginx ports: - "80:80" - "443:443" ``` This Playbook will start a server named nginx on the local host The Docker container uses the nginx image, and maps the container's 80 and 443 ports to the host's 80 and 443 ports. 4. Run Ansible Playbook To run this playbook, use the following command on the command line: ``` ansible-playbook playbook.yml ``` This command will read the file named playbook.yml and start it on the local host An nginx container. That's the basic steps to configure and deploy Docker containers using Ansible automation tool. According to the actual situation, Ansible Playbook can be further customized to meet specific needs.
