Internet without modiﬁcations to BGP and provide incremental
approaches to secure BGP and are orthogonal to cryptography
based secure BGP solutions.
Recently, Haeberlen et al. [19] propose NetReview to detect
routing anomaly caused by attacks and misconﬁguration using
fault patterns and checking tamper-evident logs with these pat-
terns in NetReview servers of ASes. In NetReview, routing mes-
sages are recorded in a tamper-evident log to analyze anomalous
behaviors of BGP routes based on deﬁned fault patterns. In this
way, NetReview can detect invalid routes caused by attacks or
conﬁguration faults and policy conﬂicts. However, NetReview
does not address the response mechanism to detected faults.
Different from NetReview, which detects BGP faults based on
fault patterns, TBGP enforces route attestation rules to guar-
antee normal behaviors of BGP routes. TBGP focuses on the
prevention of forged routes caused by unintended or malicious
misconﬁguration, but does not address detection/prevention of
policy conﬂicts, which we believe can be improved by conﬁgu-
ration static analysis [26].
C. Design Goals of TBGP
From a security perspective, TBGP seeks to defend against
different kinds of BGP attacks and guarantee the availability of
BGP routes and normal packet forwarding in the presence of
adversaries. We identify the following security goals [6].1
1) AS Number Authentication: BGP speakers can verify
whether an AS is the real owner of an AS number and is
authorized to use the AS number.
2) BGP Speaker Authentication: BGP speakers can verify
whether a speaker is legal to announce preﬁxes, to guar-
antee that the BGP speaker is associated with an AS
number.
3) AS Path Veriﬁcation: BGP speakers can verify whether the

Furthermore, in order for a secure BGP solution to be practi-
cally deployable on the Internet, the following goals should be
satisﬁed.
1) Acceptable Performance: A secure BGP solution should
introduce minimal performance overhead (e.g., CPU cy-
cles, memory footprint, and communication cost) over or-
dinary BGP and does not signiﬁcantly degrade the perfor-
mance of a BGP speaker and the convergence performance
of BGP.
2) Incremental Deployment: A secure BGP solution should be
partially deployable without disruption, which means that
a subset of entities (e.g., routers, ASes, or ISPs) can deploy
the solution without incurring loss of network connectivity.
III. DESIGN OF TBGP
For clarity, we initially assume that TBGP is fully deployed
(i.e., on all participating routers in the network), and the allo-
cation of AS numbers and IP preﬁxes to ASes is certiﬁed by
authorities. We then relax this assumption for efﬁcient crypto-
graphic operations and incremental deployment.
A. Overview
Ordinary BGP provides conﬁgurable ﬁlters called IN ﬁlters
and OUT ﬁlters, which ﬁlter incoming and outgoing routes, re-
spectively. With the ﬁlters, operators can conﬁgure their routers
to discard routes that violate certain conditions. Filters are used
by providers to ensure that they only accept or announce routes
from/to their neighbors. If all providers perform this correctly,
the network would be safe from attacks. However, many net-
works cannot ﬁlter violated routes effectively, due to the difﬁ-
culty of inferring the validity of routes from different ISPs. Ba-
sically, TBGP is designed to attest routes to check whether they
comply with the BGP speciﬁcation in ﬁlters and provide an au-
tomatic route ﬁltering mechanism.
In TBGP, a BGP speaker signs a route if it complies with a
set of route attestation rules in the OUT ﬁlters. By verifying
the signatures in the IN ﬁlter, a neighboring router can easily
know whether the route is valid in terms of BGP speciﬁcation.
With this mechanism, a transitive trust relationship can be built
among the routers along a routing path. The root of this trust
relies on the preﬁx owners that sign the route with preﬁx pri-
vate keys. Each BGP speaker veriﬁes, in its IN ﬁlter, the signa-
ture piggybacked in a received route update from its neighbor.
A successful veriﬁcation means that the route is attested by the
neighbor and is authentic, and the route in Adj-RIB-IN is up-
dated. The BGP speaker selects the best route for the preﬁx. If
the best route is changed, the BGP speaker announces the se-
lected routes to its neighbors. Before that, the BGP speaker at-
tests the route under propagation according to route attestation
rules. A route is signed by the private key of the AS number only
if it has been successfully attested, and thus neighbor routers
can easily check whether the route is trusted and authenticated
by verifying the signature.
To illustrate the idea of TBGP, we refer again to Fig. 1. Sup-
pose AS 1 announces that it is the owner of preﬁx 12.34.8.0/24.
Then R1 is authorized to announce the AS PATH {1} signed
with its private key. R2 in AS 2 receives the route update and
updates it in Adj-RIB-IN for route selection only if it success-
fully veriﬁes the signature in the IN ﬁlter. If the route is selected
as the best route to the destination 12.34.8.0/24 in R2, then R2
checks whether the route under propagation complies with the
attestation rule. The route is authenticated only if the route is
successfully attested. In this example, the AS_PATH of route
under propagation is {21}, which prolongs the AS_PATH in the
previously received route update. Then, AS 1 and AS 2 build
trust between themselves. R2 signs the AS PATH using its pri-
vate key that correspond to the AS number. Similarly, R3, R4,
and R5 verify the route in their IN ﬁlters and announce the route
to their ASes with the correct signature. Thus, AS 1, AS 2, AS 3,
AS 4, and AS 5 build a trust relationship for preﬁx 12.34.8.0/24.
Now, the routers in AS 6 cannot launch the preﬁx hijack at-
tack (see Section II) by announcing the ownership of the preﬁx
12.34.8.0/24 because they do not have the correct private keys
to sign the routes for the preﬁx. Similarly, it cannot launch the
invalid path attack (see Section II) by propagating the forged
route {61} because the route cannot be successfully attested by
AS 5 (assuming that no router is compromised). In Section IV,
we will discuss how to prevent forged routes if some routers are
compromised.
Thus, TBGP well considers different route attestation re-
quirements for different types of BGP sessions and effectively
eliminates aggregate signatures of a full AS path in route
attestations as in existing cryptography-based secure BGP
solutions. The next two subsections explain more details of the
route attestation rules and establishing transitive trust relation-
ships between different ASes/routers.
B. Route Attestation Rules for TBGP
The trust of a BGP system depends on the expected behavior
of each router when selecting and announcing route informa-
tion. A set of route attestation rules is deﬁned in TBGP, which,
if correctly enforced by a router system, can guarantee the au-
thenticity and correctness of its announced information.
First, let us consider the basic attestation rules for BGP
sessions among different ASes in TBGP, where we assume
an AS only has one BGP speaker. The OUT ﬁlter of a BGP
speaker checks whether an announced route follows the route
attestation rules based on the information in the IN ﬁlter. The
announcement is signed and further propagated only when it
passes the check. A neighboring BGP speaker, upon receiving
the announcement, ﬁrst veriﬁes if it is actually sent by a speaker
that owns the AS number. If attestation veriﬁcation succeeds,
then it means the route is trusted, and the announcement is
accepted. Thus, these two BGP speakers can build a trust re-
lationship. This is done recursively along an AS_PATH. Thus,
there is no need for a BGP speaker to check and verify every
hop in the AS_PATH, i.e., preﬁx veriﬁcation and AS_PATH
veriﬁcation for all speakers in the path. A neighboring BGP
speaker only needs to verify limited information, such as the
signature of preﬁxes or AS but not both. These attestation
operations are enforced by a BGP attestation service (see
Section IV). Through the built trust relationship, aggregated

signatures are eliminated. Before we introduce the detailed
rules, Table I gives the symbols used in these rules.
Deﬁnition 1: BGP Route Announcement Rule: A BGP
speaker is authorized to send a valid BGP announcement,

conditions are true:
1)
2)

is the owner of
This rule illustrates that an announcement is valid if and only
if: i)
; ii) or it is a reannouncement after
a previous announcement; or iii) it is an announcement after a
previous announcement that does not include valid routes. We
note that since a route update triggered by ISP policy changes
is similar to that speciﬁed by the third condition of this rule, we
do not discuss it explicitly. Note that this security rule considers
the address aggregation and legal AS prepending issues during
route propagation.
in this rule denotes that it is legal
to prepend its own AS number in an AS path.
The ﬁrst condition in this rule describes that the advertise-
ment speaker in
is authorized to announce the preﬁx if it
is the owner of the preﬁx, and the announced route should only
contain itself in the AS Path. For example, AS 1 in Fig. 1 is
allowed to advertise AS path {1} to its neighbors. The second
condition describes that the BGP speaker is allowed to advertise
a route if it is a readvertisement of a previous route and prolongs
the AS path with its AS number, or the AS path in the readver-
tisement route is a subset of the full AS path which is prolonged
by including its AS number.2 For instance, in Fig. 1, AS 2 ad-
vertises the AS path {21}, which is legal if the AS path in the
previously received route update from AS 1 is {1}. Suppose that
AS 3 receives the AS path {21} for the destination 12.34.8.0/24
and receives the AS path
) for
preﬁx 12.34.9.0/24 in the route from AS 2. The announced route
whose AS path is {21} for preﬁx 12.34.0.0/20 is allowed be-
cause it is the intersection of these two preﬁxes, and thus it is a
legal route aggregation based on the second condition.
(for some AS number
The third condition describes the situation that the announced
route is legal if the route under propagation is the union of
a record in previous received route updates and its own AS
number after receiving a route withdrawal. For example, as-
suming that the link between AS 2 and AS 3 in Fig. 1 fails,
2Actually, route disaggregation is similar to the route aggregation. In general,
AS should achieve another type of secret keys different from the preﬁx owner
keys if it announces itself as the origin of the aggregated/disaggregated preﬁx.
However, this process is application-speciﬁc, and we do not discuss it in this
paper.
AS 3 then withdraws the route to AS 5. Since AS 5 has received
a route update with AS_PATH {421}, which is recorded in the
attestation service, the route attestation rule allows AS 5 to ad-
vertise the route with AS_PATH {5421} to its neighbor ASes.
If AS 5 advertises a route whose AS path is not recorded, then
the route under propagation is regarded as a forged one and
dropped. In addition, if a BGP speaker receives a route con-
taining its own AS number, e.g., the route oscillation cases dis-
cussed in [27], then it announces another recorded route, which
is similar to the route withdrawal case above.
Deﬁnition 2: BGP Route Withdrawal Rule: A BGP speaker
,
is authorized to send a valid BGP withdrawal,
if and only if the following condition is true:
is the owner of
1)
.
Similarly, this rule describes that a route withdrawal is al-
lowed if and only if
or there is no avail-
able route record for preﬁx
in the attestation service. For ex-
ample, assuming that the link between AS 1 and AS 2 fails in
Fig. 1, AS 2 does not have an available route to AS 1. Then, the
BGP speaker in AS 2 is allowed to send route withdrawals to
AS 3 and AS 4.
C. Trust Establishment
The above route attestation rules guarantee the validation of
BGP announcements if they are really enforced on each router.
We can use these rules to verify this via attestation service in
the IN and OUT ﬁlters of a BGP speaker. As aforementioned,
when a BGP speaker in AS 1 receives an announcement, it is
ﬁrstly checked and veriﬁed by the attestation service in the IN
ﬁlter. If the received announcement is sent by the owner of
a preﬁx, the preﬁx string is used to verify the signature. As
shown in Fig. 2, through veriﬁcation, the identity of the orig-
inating BGP speaker in AS 1 and the ownership of the preﬁx
are validated in AS 2. This is the ﬁrst level of a trust relation-
ship for preﬁx 12.34.8.0/24. If the announcement is propagated
to AS 3 by a delegated BGP speaker in AS 2, then we need
to verify whether the speaker of AS 2 is authorized to propa-
gate this route. Thus, the AS number of AS 2 is used to verify
whether the BGP speaker is an authentic owner of AS 2. If the
announcement is veriﬁed in the IN ﬁlter of AS 3, then AS 3
can trust the announcement because the successful veriﬁcation
means that the received AS_PATH is composed with previous
consecutive trusted ASes. Thus, the received route should be
updated as an active record and stored in the route database for
further attestation by the OUT ﬁlter. Similarly, AS 4 can build
trust with AS 2 by verifying the announcement.
After a BGP speaker completes a route selection process,
the chosen route is further propagated if there is a change in
the route. The route announcement is then checked in the OUT
ﬁlter. First, the active record
of the route record updated in
the IN ﬁlter, which triggers the route recomputation, is located.
If the record does not exist or does not match a received route,
which means that the route is sent by the owner or the route
update follows a received route not including a valid AS path,
then all the records of the preﬁx are fetched from the route data-
base. Then the attestation service checks whether the announce-
ment is allowed based on the route attestation rules. If the an-
nouncement is legal, then it is signed and sent to the neighboring
