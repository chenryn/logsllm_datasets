clicking a potentially malicious ad, but also goes against any
given standard of the online advertisement industry. In this
regard, we performed an empirical analysis to investigate the
FLIS services’ compliance, in displaying overlay ads, with the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) standards.
Compliance with IAB standards. IAB is an organization that
develops standards for the online advertising industry. It has
deﬁned metrics that deal with the behaviors speciﬁc to the
nonlinear (overlay) video ads [13]. According to these metrics,
an overlay ad should not cover more than 1/5 (20%) of the
height of a player, with the best practice to display the ad at
the bottom half of the streaming content.
To measure the FLIS services’ compliance with IAB
standards, we analyzed the crawled data that was used to
identify the channel providers (see Section III-B for details).
Along with the network trafﬁc,
this data contains HTML
code, source URL, and absolute location and size of all
 elements of each crawled webpage (iframes-log).
We selected 44,960 pages from this data that were identiﬁed
to be broadcasting live streams using the RTMP protocol.
Next, we extracted the pageUrl from the network trafﬁc of
each crawled webpage by interpreting the RTMP connect
message (Figure 3). This pageUrl corresponds to the source
URL of an  that embeds a Flash player in the
webpage. Once we have identiﬁed the source URL of the
 that embeds a Flash player, we use the iframes-
log to identify its location and size on the page (same as
the position and size of the rendered Flash player). Finally,

is present. This provides the aggregators with an oracle to
detect the presence of an ad-blocker, which can then be used
to force users to disable their ad-blockers.
(cid:5) antiblock. Similar to the ad-block detection technique
with advertisement.js, antiblock.org provides a script
that allows website administrators to detect the presence of a
multitude of extensions and plugins that block advertisements.
In addition, the script attempts to avoid detection by a few ad-
block extensions. In case the script detects that advertisements
are still blocked, the default behavior is to make the webpage
inaccessible. This ultimately forces users to disable their ad-
blocking solutions if they want to access the page’s contents.
Our analysis highlights a clear violence of the IAB stan-
dards by the FLIS services in displaying overlay ads on the
video player. Moreover, our ﬁndings indicate that the parties in
the FLIS ecosystem undeniably compel their users to interact
with the overlay ads and adopt various deceptive techniques
to gain ad revenue from the unintended clicks.
E. Exposing Users to Malware, Scam, and Adult Websites
In this section, we investigate the ad websites opened when
a user is deceived (or lured) into clicking the overlay ads
displayed on the video player by the FLIS parties. From our
experiments, we noticed that the interaction of users with the
overlay ads opened a variety of ad websites. These sites often
present security threats including exposure to malware, scams,
and link-hijacking.
Automated interaction with overlay video ads. To gather ad
websites that opened when a user interacts with the overlay
ads, we implemented an additional module in our crawler
detailed in Section III-B. During the crawl, the module identi-
ﬁes the  responsible for rendering the Flash player
by utilizing a whitelist of the identiﬁed channel providers.
Afterwards,
it uses the iframe-logs and tries to click the
 elements (i.e., overlay ads etc.), overriding the
Flash player on the webpage. Before clicking an overlay, the
crawler sleeps for 20 seconds to allow any redirections. Finally,
it log any redirections to different domains and capture the
screenshots of the opened ad webpages. Our crawler visits each
page using four different user-agent strings covering popular
browsers and operating systems.
At
the end of this process, our crawler collected the
screenshots of 30,354 ad pages that were opened due to the
clicking of overlays in the top 1,000 aggregator domains.
Capturing an image of the ad page provides us with the essence
9
of what a user would have been exposed to while interacting
with the overlay ads. We observe that these images contained a
large variety of sites for deceptive malware downloads, scams,
and adult material.
Ethical considerations. To discover whether ads are malicious
or not we have to, unavoidably, deliver clicks on them and
monitor their ﬁnal destination. As it becomes clear in the next
paragraphs, the vast majority of ads present on FLIS services
are of a malicious nature. This was not a surprise for us since
the nature of ads that we encountered when considering this
project was also mostly malicious and is what prompted us
to conduct this study. We argue that, even though our crawler
may have charged some advertisers9 for the duration of our
crawling experiment, this was probably beneﬁcial for the Web
at large since we absorbed the ads that would have otherwise
victimized real users. Moreover, our crawling methodology is
in line with previous studies that have seeked to understand
online ads [15], [17].
Classifying advertisements. To automatically categorize the
collected ad websites we clustered the pages based on their
visual appearance. We used a perceptual hash function [53]
to automatically cluster the screenshots of the ad pages. A
perceptual hash function returns similar hashes for two images,
if one is visually similar to the other that may have gone
through modiﬁcations such as scaling, aspect ratio alterations,
or minor changes in color. We computed the perceptual hash
of all screenshots and cluster them in groups by using the
Hamming distance between hashes as our distance metric. If
the distance between two hashes was less than an empirically
calculated threshold10, we clustered the corresponding pages.
By using the perceptual hash functions, we achieved a preci-
sion of 99.8% and recall of 98.4% (compared against manually
generated ground-truth of 1,000 screenshots). Once the clus-
tering process ﬁnished, we manually veriﬁed the clusters, and
examined each cluster for malware, scam, and adult ads. We
categorize ads as malware when they lead to the installation
of malware (binary or browser extension).
Findings. Table III shows the results of our clustering and
labeling, separated by four user-agent. The ﬁrst thing to notice
is that, on average, 50% of the time, a click on an overlay ad
leads the user to a malware-hosting webpage. The majority of
malware-hosting pages were constructed to imitate the look
and feel of the FLIS services, often trying to trick the user to
install malware by pretending that she needs special software
(binary or extension) to watch the live stream. Figure 8 shows
an example of such a webpage, that was opened after clicking
an overlay ad on stream2watch.com. This page is trying to
trick the user into downloading a malicious plug-in as if it
were provided by original streaming website.
Meanwhile,
in Table III, one can notice that speciﬁc
browsers were much more exposed to the malware-hosting
webpages than others. Chrome and Safari,
the two most
popular browsers, are the ones most exposed to the malware
pages through overlay ad clicking. One logical reason for this
trend is that, as depicted in recent security studies, attackers
9Most reputed ad networks have deployed detection mechanisms to ﬁlter
bot generated clicks and cease charging the advertisers when they identify
artiﬁcial trafﬁc [14], [21], [49].
10We select
the value 0.3 as threshold. To do that, we computed the
clustering accuracy on a subset of the extracted screenshots for each threshold
value between [0,1] with a step of 0.1 [25]. A threshold of 0.3 achieved best
precision and recall.

are more inclined in targeting the popular browser(s) for ad in-
jections and malversting [48], [51], [30]. As such, for Internet
Explorer and Firefox, it may be more beneﬁcial for malicious
advertisers, along with presenting malware sites, to expose
FLIS users to money laundering scams, adult gaming/video
websites, and fraudulent technician services.
Overall, while advertisers are the root cause for malicious
ads, the involvement of the FLIS parties cannot be entirely
exempted as they expose their users to security threats. From
the prevalence of discovered abuse, it is evident that the FLIS
parties are more inclined towards malicious advertisers to
monetize their operations, exposing their users to malware-
laden domains, fraudulent scams, and adult content.
We found that 1.6% of ads displayed on the crawled FLIS
pages had escaped their  and redirected the entire
page to a malicious website. We observed two different types
of abuses in these malicious websites. In the ﬁrst type, the
malicious page imitates adobe.com and offers the malware
disguised as the latest version of Adobe Flash. In the second
type,

F. Additional Malicious Activities
G. Malicious Payloads Investigation
Immediate distributor of malware. During our experiment
with overlay ads, we accidentally found that seven simi-
lar aggregator domains resolving to same IP address, were
distributing a malicious Android application. When visited
through a speciﬁc mobile browser user agent
the website
redirects to m.liveonlinetv247.info. This webpage offers a
complimentary application to watch free live sport streams on
the mobile device. The offered application is an adware known
as Android Airpush. It contains an advertising package that has
the capability to display advertisements without user content
and carry out potential ad fraud. This ﬁnding highlights the
direct involvement of the FLIS service in exploiting users for
monetary gains.
Link hijacking. We also observed link hijacking while an-
alyzing the overlay ads in FLIS domains. As mentioned
earlier, FLIS services use advertiser scripts that render multiple
 elements to place overlay ads on the video player.
This use of an  adequately separates the advertiser
from the including page, as the advertising scripts cannot
interact with the DOM of the parent frame because of the
Same-Origin Policy (SOP) [11], a web application security
speciﬁcation. However, there are certain exemptions in SOP
that allow all frames to navigate any other frame which
they can reference. As an example, an advertiser’s overlay
 can redirect the entire FLIS page to a different tar-
get by using Javascript’s window.top.location.href
method. This method allows any child  to access
the location of the topmost window, in the windows hierarchy,
and can redirect it to a potentially malicious webpage in the
same tab.
To ﬁnd out more about the nature of malware offered to the
users of FLIS services, we downloaded all the payloads from
the labeled malware ad webpages. We found that based on the
user-agent string, in other words, based on the browser and OS
of a victim, malicious domains present environment-speciﬁc
payloads. For instance, a user with a Google Chrome browser
was presented with a malicious extension when redirected to
the ad website. Similarly, an executable was presented for
Firefox running on Microsoft Windows, an Apple Mac image
for Safari OS X and so on. To analyze malware binaries we
used the VirusTotal (VT) service [10], to determine whether the
binary had ever been scanned before and whether it was labeled
as malicious by an antivirus vendor. To examine malicious
Chrome extensions, we leverage the techniques from [48], [51]
and manually analyze the behavior of collected extensions in
the browser.
Malware binaries and their distributors. Table IV sum-
marizes the malware dataset obtained during our analysis of
FLIS services. During our experiments with overlay ads, we
downloaded 12,683 malware payloads, yielding 1,353 distinct
binaries, out of which 629 samples were unknown to VT. This
means, that at the time of scanning the binary using the VT
service, the binary was not in the VT’s database. Of these,
one binary was initially classiﬁed as benign by all the AV in
VT and later labeled as malware by a reputable AV after the
few days re-scan. Thus, this ﬁle is considered as a zero-day
malware sample. At the same time we noticed that, most of
the malware samples submitted to VT belong to families like
fake installers for malicious browser plug-ins, adwares, and
browser activity monitors.
