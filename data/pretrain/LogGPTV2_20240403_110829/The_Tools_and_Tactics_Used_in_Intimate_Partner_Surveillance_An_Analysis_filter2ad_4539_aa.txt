Abstract
Abusers increasingly use spyware apps, account compro-
mise, and social engineering to surveil their intimate partners,
causing substantial harms that can culminate in violence. This
form of privacy violation, termed intimate partner surveillance
(IPS), is a profoundly challenging problem to address due to
the physical access and trust present in the relationship be-
tween the target and attacker. While previous research has
examined IPS from the perspectives of survivors, we present
the ﬁrst measurement study of online forums in which (po-
tential) attackers discuss IPS strategies and techniques. In
domains such as cybercrime, child abuse, and human trafﬁck-
ing, studying the online behaviors of perpetrators has led to
better threat intelligence and techniques to combat attacks.
We aim to provide similar insights in the context of IPS. We
identiﬁed ﬁve online forums containing discussion of moni-
toring cellphones and other means of surveilling an intimate
partner, including three within the context of investigating
relationship inﬁdelity. We perform a mixed-methods analysis
of these forums, surfacing the tools and tactics that attack-
ers use to perform surveillance. Via qualitative analysis of
forum content, we present a taxonomy of IPS strategies used
and recommended by attackers, and synthesize lessons for
technologists seeking to curb the spread of IPS.
1 Introduction
Technology-based intimate partner surveillance (IPS) causes
immense harms. A discrete form of intimate partner violence
(IPV), IPS is the deliberate surveillance of an intimate partner
with or without their knowledge, levied through technical and
non-technical methods. Survivors have reported their abusers
use spyware apps, account compromise, GPS trackers, shared
cellular plans, and more to monitor their digital lives and
physical locations [18, 19, 32, 41, 46]. Prior work has also
indicated that a wealth of IPS apps are available online [6]
and in active use against victims [17, 22, 39].
To better protect targets of abuse, we need to both im-
prove technologies’ robustness to abuse and better inform
interventional approaches that directly aid victims [17, 22].
To achieve these aspirations, however, we need to better un-
derstand how those interested in perpetrating IPS learn to
conduct these attacks. To date, there have been few inves-
tigations into how attackers locate the resources that help
them enact abuse. Chatterjee et al. [6] highlight that blogs,
videos, and question-and-answer sites exist online that help
facilitate IPS, but stop short of investigating the communities
who make use of them. There is a methodological hurdle in
discovering this information: we need a way to hear from
potential attackers directly.
In this work, we provide the ﬁrst study exploring how po-
tential attackers use the Internet to learn how to enact IPS
against their victims. We identify a set of ﬁve public, online fo-
rums where people discuss inﬁdelity in intimate relationships
and tools for monitoring cellphones. We build a crawler to re-
trieve the conversations on these forums and use it to compile
a dataset containing over 200 K posts spread across almost
20 K threads. This dataset contains an unprecedented amount
of information about the strategies of IPS attackers, contextu-
alized in user-generated natural language. While prior work
has described the attacks experienced by victims, we present a
detailed view of how these attacks are created and developed—
the capabilities attackers seek, the vulnerabilities they exploit,
and the community dynamics that enable them.
We analyze this data using mixed-methods. We begin with
quantitative measurements of the forums, their users, and their
posting behaviors. These analyses reveal that most forums
contain “superusers” involved with a disproportionately large
fraction of threads. For two of the ﬁve forums, we discover
that their content consists almost entirely of spam advertising
particular spyware tools, in a manner that may be consistent
with search engine optimization (SEO) techniques deployed
by the creators of those tools. We also determine that many of
their most highly viewed threads are about technology-based
IPS, suggesting these forums have generated a signiﬁcant
audience for IPS-related content.
We then perform qualitative coding of a large sample of
750 threads (250 from each of the three forums that are not

inundated by spyware ads). Via thematic analysis [4], we
surface novel insights about the online behaviors of IPS at-
tackers. We show that potential attackers seek online support
for suspicions of inﬁdelity, and that community members
respond by outlining exactly how to track, monitor, and other-
wise compromise the privacy of an intimate partner. We show
that discussion of IPS is prevalent in these forums, with one
forum having 78% of sampled threads related to IPS.
We develop a taxonomy of IPS attacks surfaced from the
suggestions made in these forums (Table 3). Tool-based
attacks directly weaponize technology such as audiovisual
recorders, keyloggers, backup recovery tools, and more, and
can be understood in two subcategories: those requiring phys-
ical access to a partner, and those that do not. Coercion and
subterfuge attacks manipulate a partner into unlocking their
devices or accounts. Finally, we see many suggestions to out-
source attacks by hiring private investigators.
Although some of these strategies have been reported by
victims [19, 32], our analysis provides the complementary
view of potential perpetrators. We highlight tools, tactics, and
services that have not been reported previously, and which we
believe were previously unknown to those helping victims.
We also report on the conversational patterns within these
forums that enable would-be attackers (what we describe
as escalation), and, conversely, patterns in which they are
discouraged away from IPS (de-escalation). These ﬁndings
suggest that public forums can serve as a source of threat
intelligence informing interventions to dissuade abuse.
In fact, our work is already having impact for IPS interven-
tions. We shared our results with the team running a clinic pro-
viding direct assistance to IPV survivors facing IPS [17, 22],1
who are working towards using our ﬁndings in their pro-
cedures. More broadly, our analyses yield insights for tech-
nologists, platforms, and advocates on how we might defend
against and mitigate the spread of IPS. We close by discussing
implications for platforms, future work in automated threat in-
telligence, and how policymakers might address the for-proﬁt
operations that ﬁnancially beneﬁt from abuse.
2 Background and Related Work
IPV and technology abuse. Prior work has examined the be-
haviors, justiﬁcations, and tactics of intimate partner abusers
[23,27,43], including work identifying suspicions of inﬁdelity
as a leading trigger for IPV in heterosexual couples [3, 36].
Of this literature, a growing body of work explores the role
of technology in IPV, including how abusers exploit tech-
nology to monitor, harass, control or otherwise harm their
targets [6, 11, 18, 19, 32, 41, 46]. Chatterjee et al. [6] ob-
served that abusers are likely exploiting easy-to-ﬁnd online
resources, including tutorials, question-and-answer sites, and
videos explaining how to use spyware for IPS. Roundy et
1https://www.ipvtechresearch.org
al. [39] used datasets from a major antivirus vendor to explore
a broader class of creepware that includes spyware, but also
SMS bombers, hacking tutorials, and more. These works have
provided valuable intelligence for corresponding anti-IPS in-
terventions with victims and survivors [17, 22].
To date, however, less research has examined the role of
online communities in IPV. Some have examined how targets
experience IPV in digital media and seek support through
online forums [12, 30], but to the best of our knowledge, ours
is the ﬁrst study to measure and analyze how forums lead
attackers to such tools. Our work conﬁrms that attackers are
discussing and recommending IPS strategies on public forums
available to any Internet user. We also identify new tactics,
such as custom scripts to monitor websites visited and launch
man-in-the-middle attacks.
Online measurement studies. Prior work has used measure-
ment and analysis of online forums to shed light on commu-
nities discussing criminal or otherwise malicious behaviors.
For some of these communities, this research has led to the
development of threat intelligence.
Commercially motivated criminals, such as spammers and
black-hat hackers, use online forums as marketplaces and for
learning adversarial techniques from each other [16, 35, 45].
Research on this phenomenon has identiﬁed structure, trust,
and superusers in these communities [1, 2, 21]. Relatedly,
online forums used by pedophiles and others involved in
the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse materi-
als have been studied to gain insights into the way partici-
pants justify or normalize abuse, and share technical and non-
technical strategies that facilitate abuse [13]. Similar methods
have also been used to analyze forums associated with hate
groups [7, 38], cyberbullying [8, 29], doxxing [40], mis- and
disinformation campaigns [42], harassment [24, 25, 31], and
sex trafﬁcking [37]. These measurement studies include ones
that directly document abuse (e.g., hate and harassment on so-
cial media), as well as those investigating perpetrators’ discus-
sions of tactics (e.g., perpetrators sharing ways to maximize
the emotional impact of harassing messages).
Our work falls in the latter category. While methodologi-
cally similar, we differ in our focus on people who use online
forums to discuss strategies for IPS. Similar to the work on cy-
bercrime and child abuse forums, analysis of online resources
such as craigslist and backpage has led to threat intelligence
that helped combat human trafﬁcking [37]. We aim to have
a similar impact on IPS and IPV more broadly. In summary,
our research questions are:
• What role do online forums play in surfacing IPS resources
to potential attackers?
online communities?
• What role do commercially motivated entities play in these
• What tools and tactics are being suggested to potential
attackers, and at what levels of technical sophistication?

3 Forums and Datasets
To answer these research questions, we perform a mixed-
methods analysis of a large sample of posts and threads from
public online forums with a high density of IPS-relevant con-
versation. In this section, we review our analysis targets and
data collection approach, as well as the resulting datasets.
Inﬁdelity and IPS forums. We identiﬁed several forums
whose content includes a large number of posts touching on
IPS. These were discovered through a combination of pointers
from prior work [6] and online web searches using a com-
bination of terms such as “spyware track wife”. While we
endeavored to be exhaustive, we restricted attention only to
publicly available forums, excluding forums accessible only
to registered users or users who had crossed some threshold
number of active posts. We may also have missed forums
that are not easily found via search engines. Finally, many
forums have a small number of posts touching on IPS, but
with the overwhelming majority of content being irrelevant
to our study. We excluded those from our analysis and se-
lected forums that seemed to have a higher concentration of
IPS-related posts. Future work might explore techniques to
discover IPS-related forums that are harder to access and ﬁnd.
Our analyses focus primarily on three forums that aim to
help people navigate inﬁdelity. To prevent the publication of
this work from advertising spyware, or from unintentionally
impacting these public forums by convincing them to go
private, we anonymize them.2 The forums we study include:
• Forum A, a community dedicated to discussing “inves-
tigative equipment.” Forum A is a subforum of a website
providing resources on resolving marital conﬂicts with
Alexa rank approximately 500,000.
• Forum B, a community dedicated to advice on “detect-
ing inﬁdelity and deception.” Forum B is a subforum of
a website providing resources on cheating in romantic
relationships, with Alexa rank approximately 900,000.
• Forum C, a moderated Reddit subforum that bills itself
as “a safe place to ask for advice and guidance” for those
facing inﬁdelity in a relationship. As of February 2020, Fo-
rum C had approximately 80,000 subscribers, and Reddit
was the 18th most popular website in the world.3
We additionally investigated two subforums that focus on spy-
ware tools: Forums D and E, both subforums of a community
for cellphone advice. Forum D focuses on spyware for mobile
phones, while Forum E focuses on spyware generally. These
subforums surfaced in Internet searches for the same sets of
IPS-related keywords as those used to discover the three inﬁ-
delity forums above. As we discuss further in Section 4, our
analysis concludes most content on these forums are spam

advertisements for particular spyware tools. For simplicity,
we will use the term “forum” to refer to the communities we
studied in-depth (e.g., Forum C), and “parent forum” to refer
to their parents where needed (e.g., Reddit).
Data collection. We collected data from Forums A, B, D
and E via custom crawlers built using Scrapy, an open-source,
Python-based framework for web scraping.4 Our crawlers
preserved the threaded structure of each forum’s content, as
well as metadata like views and post and update timestamps
where available. We did not download any media beyond
text—speciﬁcally avoiding images—and stored all data in a
local database on a secured server. Our analysis covers a set
of scrapes collected using this pipeline in October of 2019.
For Forum C, we used the scrape available via the Reddit
corpus within ConvoKit [5], which was collected in October
2018. Table 1 summarizes the complete dataset.
Limitations. Our study combines quantitative and qualita-
tive methodologies to characterize a sampling of publicly
available forums where discussion of IPS tactics manifests.
We emphasize our work may not generalize to discussion on
private forums, such as those that require the creation of an ac-
count and a threshold of posts or months active for access, or
those occurring within private social groups on larger social
media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. We also focus
on English-language forums, and thus our ﬁndings cannot
be taken to represent the scope of IPS discussion worldwide.
We believe there is compelling future research in investigat-
ing larger public-facing communities, like other subreddits or
closed communities on and off of inﬂuential social networks.
Ethics. Throughout this work, we were sensitive to the ethics
of using online discussions of highly personal topics for re-
search. Our data is from publicly available fora accessible on
the Internet without authentication. Our IRB ofﬁce reviewed
the study and deemed it to not be human-subjects research,
since all data was already in the public domain. Still, we
took precautions to ensure our research remained safe and
privacy-preserving. The only identiﬁers we used were the pub-
lic usernames associated with each post. We did not pursue
identiﬁcation of people from their posts or usernames, or col-
lect or store images. In reporting our work, we have scrubbed
information that might trace back to the people behind the
pseudonyms, e.g., locations or speciﬁc narrative details.
4 Forum Activity and Users
We begin by measuring the nature of activity on these forums.
Later on (Sections 6, 7), we use qualitative methods to more
deeply characterize their content.
