User: How to use Git for version control and manage software code?
Assistant: The following are the basic steps to use Git for version control and software code management: 1. Install Git: Install the Git client on your computer, the download address is https://git-scm.com/downloads. 2. Create a warehouse: Open the Git Bash terminal, enter the folder of your project, and use the command "git init" to create a warehouse. 3. Add files: Use the command "git add filename" to add the files to be tracked to the warehouse. 4. Submit the modification: Use the command "git commit -m 'commit information'" to submit the modification and add the description information of the modification. 5. View status: Use the command "git status" to view the status of the current warehouse. 6. Branch management: Use the command "git branch branch name" to create a new branch, use the command "git checkout branch name" to switch to a different branch, and use the command "git merge branch name" to merge branches. 7. Remote warehouse: Use the command "git remote add origin remote warehouse address" to associate the local warehouse with the remote warehouse, and use the command "git push -u origin branch name" to push the branch in the local warehouse to the remote warehouse. 8. Multi-person collaboration: If multiple people jointly develop a project, you can use the command "git clone remote warehouse address" to copy the code in the remote warehouse to the local for modification, and use the command "git pull" to synchronize the changes in the remote warehouse to local warehouse. The above are the basic methods of Git version control and software code management. The specific use needs to be optimized and adjusted according to your actual situation.
