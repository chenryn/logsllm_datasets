ABSTRACT
Reliability is a critical requirement of the Internet. The availabil-
ity and resilience of the Internet under failures can have signiﬁcant
global effects. However, in the current Internet routing architecture,
achieving the high level of reliability demanded by many mission-
critical activities can be costly. In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a
novel solution framework called reliability as an interdomain ser-
vice (REIN) that can be incrementally deployed in the Internet and
may improve the redundancy of IP networks at low cost. We then
present robust algorithms to efﬁciently utilize network redundancy
to improve reliability. We use real IP network topologies and traf-
ﬁc traces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and
algorithms.

INTRODUCTION
Reliability is a major concern on the Internet. As it becomes a
critical infrastructural component of the global information-based
society, the availability and resilience of the Internet under fail-
ures can have signiﬁcant global and social effects. Recognizing the
importance of Internet reliability, the GENI initiative [16] states
that “any future Internet should attain the highest possible level of
availability, so that it can be used for mission-critical activities,
and it can serve the nation in times of crisis.” The Internet service
providers (ISPs) also recognize the importance of reliability. In a
recent survey of major network carriers including AT&T, BT, and
NTT, Telemark [40] concluded that “The 3 elements which carriers
are most concerned about when deploying communication services
are network reliability, network usability and network fault pro-
cessing capabilities. The top 3 elements all belong to the reliability
category.”
Unfortunately, due to accidents, maintenance mistakes, natural
disasters, and even malicious attacks, failures are part of the ev-
eryday life of an IP network (e.g., [19, 32]). Cable cuts, the most

common physical-layer failures, occur virtually every few days in
extensive networks, despite many measures for the physical protec-
tion of cables [19].
One of the major goals of network engineers and operators is to
eliminate or minimize the impacts of failures on customers. Indeed,
IP network owners have clear incentives to manage these failures
well, because unmanaged failures can cause severe service disrup-
tions and lead to signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and reputation damages.
However, achieving high reliability by tolerating failures well
generally requires signiﬁcant investments. A major challenge is ob-
taining redundancy at a reasonable cost. By redundancy, we mean
both the diversity of physical connectivity and the over-provisioning
of bandwidth to carry trafﬁc originally passing through any failed
equipment. Optical layer protection on a SONET ring provides re-
dundancy, but at a cost that limits its deployment [17]. Therefore,
IP networks rely also on IP routing to detect and reroute trafﬁc
around failures. However, IP rerouting still depends on available
redundancy. With the cost of over-provisioning and, in particu-
lar, the expenses to obtain rights of way to install alternative paths
(e.g., along natural gas pipelines, highways or railways), many IP
networks, in particular ISP networks, face the challenge of adding
redundancy in a cost-effective way to stay competitive in the highly
competitive ISP market.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework called reliability
as an interdomain service (REIN) to increase the redundancy (i.e.,
physical diversity and bandwidth) available to an IP network at low
cost, thereby increasing the failure processing capability of IP net-
works. Speciﬁcally, previous studies consider redundancy only in
a single network, which is limited by its budget and rights of way.
Our key observation is that there can be redundancy across multiple
networks. For example, large IP networks in the US cover the same
geographic regions and place their routers at similar sites (e.g., ma-
jor cities). If we overlay two networks, for two sites in both net-
works, when one network does not have direct links between these
two sites, the other network may have. Even when both networks
have direct links between these two sites, the links may be placed
at different locations (e.g., one along highway and the other along
railway). Thus, when there is a failure inside one network, the other
network can provide redundancy. By designing a framework that
allows neighboring networks to use the resources of each other as
backup, we may be able to improve network reliability at low social
and network cost. This may be more beneﬁcial to smaller networks
with limited resources than to larger networks with more resources
to manage physical diversity and capacity internally.
Our idea of pooling the resources of multiple networks together
for mutual backup provides a totally new avenue towards improv-
ing network reliability at low cost. A similar idea is already being
practiced in some other contexts. For example, multiple partici-
pants contribute to a common pool of resources to form a shared
insurance. This can be far more affordable than individual provi-
sioning. The airline industry also uses a similar idea. When an
airline’s aircraft for some ﬂight segment is not available due to me-
chanical problems or late arrival, the airline may use other airlines’
ﬂights to provide transport for its customers. This is far cheaper
than each airline having a large number of reserved aircrafts. Such
sharing of resources improves the reliability of individual carriers,
reduces the backup costs of individual carriers, and also reduces
social cost (i.e., less waste of overall resources).
We caution that the beneﬁts of our scheme depend on several
practical factors.
In particular, it depends on the agreement be-
tween neighboring networks to participate in the scheme and share
more information than they currently do. For instance, for best
performance, REIN would require cross-provider shared risk link
group (SRLG) data which may not be readily available. Also, the
potential physical diversity improvement using the scheme may be
limited among a group of networks, such as those that have their
ﬁbers laid in the same conduit. In this case, a single event such
as an excavation accident could impact all networks in the group.
These practical factors must be taken into account while weighing
the cost and beneﬁts of the scheme.
Complementing the REIN framework, we design algorithms to
efﬁciently utilize both the intradomain and the interdomain redun-
dancies to improve network reliability. It is our observation that,
even if a network has enough redundancy to handle a failure sce-
nario under optimal usage of the redundancy, the implemented al-
gorithm may not use the redundancy efﬁciently enough, leading
to reduced reliability. For example, the widely implemented fast
rerouting (FRR) algorithm uses only the shortest paths for rerout-
ing. This limited form of rerouting may not efﬁciently utilize all
available network redundancy [22]. For example, in our evalua-
tions, we show that there are single-link failure scenarios in the
Abilene network where shortest-path-based rerouting would require
a bandwidth nearly 300% of actual link capacity at a bottleneck
link, while the bandwidth requirement of an optimal rerouting al-
gorithm is far below actual link capacity. Although TCP congestion
control or priority-based schemes could alleviate the impact, over-
loaded links can cause long delays, high packet loss rates, reduced
network throughput (e.g., TCP ﬂows), BGP session resets, and/or
even router crashes.
Our algorithms address two practical challenges. First, although
various optimal rerouting algorithms have been studied before (e.g.,
[5, 26]), they are typically based on ﬂow-based routing, which is
not readily implementable in the Internet. We introduce the gen-
eral notion of the coverage of a set of paths, and devise a general
technique to convert a ﬂow-based routing to a path-based routing
that is implementable in the Internet. This technique can be applied
in a broader context, such as trafﬁc engineering (TE) in general.
Second, as virtual private networks (VPNs) become a fast grow-
ing segment of IP business and a major source of revenue, there
is growing practical need for integrating VPNs. Although there are
previous studies on bandwidth provisioning for VPNs (e.g., [10, 12,
30]), we present the ﬁrst formulation and algorithms on integrating
trafﬁc engineering and failure protection with VPNs.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and algo-
rithms using real IP network topologies and trafﬁc traces. We show
that network reliability may be substantially improved by using a
small number of interdomain bypass paths. For example, we eval-
uate the number of interdomain bypass paths required to reduce
the percentage of links with low link connectivity (i.e., less than or
equal to 2) in a network. We show that we can reduce this percent-
age to 0 for Abilene using only 3 paths, and from 29% to 8% for
Sprint using only 5 paths, assuming that these interdomain bypass
paths are not part of any intradomain shared risk link groups. We
also evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and algorithms to
reduce trafﬁc intensity at bottleneck links during failure scenarios.
For Abilene, we show that there exist failure scenarios where we
can reduce the trafﬁc intensity on the bottleneck by 270% of the

bottleneck link capacity, when Abilene uses the COPE trafﬁc en-
gineering technique [42] as the basis. For a major IP network, we
show that there exist failure scenarios where we can reduce the nor-
malized trafﬁc intensity on the bottleneck link by 118% and 35%
of the bottleneck link capacity, when the network uses oblivious
routing [6] and COPE as basis, respectively. The reduction is more
substantial if the networks use standard shortest path routing. Fur-
thermore, the impacts of the diverted trafﬁc on the neighboring IP
networks that provide the bypass paths are small.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
the overall architecture of REIN. Next, we present our algorithms
for integrated trafﬁc engineering, VPN provisioning, and fast rerout-
ing in Section 3 and our algorithms for selecting interdomain by-
pass paths in Section 4. In Section 5, we present evaluation results.
In Section 6, we discuss related work. Our conclusions and future
work are in Section 7.
2. ARCHITECTURE
In this section, we outline the basic system architecture of REIN.
It is further speciﬁed in the following sections.
2.1 Overview
An IP network needs to be protected against failures both inside
and outside of the network.
In this paper, we focus on protect-
ing intradomain links and directly connected interdomain (peering)
links.
To motivate and illustrate the basic idea of the REIN architec-
ture, we consider one recent event [43] on January 9, 2006, when
the Sprint backbone network, a major US backbone network, was
partitioned into two disconnected components by two ﬁber cuts.
Figure 1 illustrates the event. This event led to the disconnection of
long-distance service for millions of Sprint PCS and Nextel wire-
less customers west of the Rockies, network partitions for corpo-
rations that relied on the carrier to link ofﬁce networks, and sub-
stantially decreased throughput of transcontinental Internet trafﬁc
routed over Sprint.
The key observation of REIN is that under network partition-
ing, it is possible to route trafﬁc between disconnected components
through neighboring IP networks. We refer to such routes through
neighboring IP networks as interdomain bypass paths. In the pre-
ceding example, both of the two disconnected components of the
Sprint network have peers connected to AT&T. For instance, Fig-
ure 1 shows one peering between Sprint and AT&T at Los Angeles,
and another peering of the two networks at Dallas. If Sprint were
able to use AT&T’s network as a backup, it could be connected and
thus have greatly reduced the impacts of the partitioning.
The Sprint incident is one example of network partitioning. In
Section 5, we have evaluated the connectivity of many IP networks
and found, in each case, that there are backbone links that have
connectivity less than or equal to two (as high as 60% of links in
some smaller networks that are more vulnerable). These networks
may improve their connectivity through REIN.
REIN is also useful when an IP network is not partitioned, but
nevertheless does not have enough redundant bandwidth to reroute
trafﬁc around failures. Such a network can beneﬁt from the addi-
tional bandwidth made available through REIN. For example, in
our evaluations, we identify failure scenarios in the Abilene net-
work where, when two links are down, a single link becomes a
bottleneck and the total trafﬁc demand on the link could be almost
3 times its capacity even under optimal rerouting. However, using
REIN, the network can handle the failure scenarios without over-
loading any links.
To realize the beneﬁts of REIN, we need to address the following
practical issues:
• Why would IP networks share interdomain bypass paths?
• What is the signaling protocol to share these paths?
• How can the imported interdomain bypass paths be used in
the data path?
• After an IP network imports these paths, how does it effec-
tively utilize them in improving reliability?
In the next three subsections we discuss the ﬁrst three issues re-
spectively. We address the fourth issue in Sections 3 and 4.
2.2 Business Models
Similar to traditional Internet interdomain business relationships,
there can be multiple business models for the sharing of interdo-
main bypass paths. We are particularly interested in models that
involve only two neighboring IP networks, because the two net-
works can reach an agreement and provision their peering links to
support the agreed model independent of other IP networks. Since
there is no need for global coordination, such models allow incre-
mental deployment in the Internet.
• The ﬁrst is a peering model where networks A and B provide
mutual backup without ﬁnancial settlement. This model im-
proves the reliability of both networks at low cost, and thus
provides both networks with incentives. Similar to the tradi-
tional Internet peering relationship which depends on sym-
metry in trafﬁc, there should be some enforcement of sym-
metry in bypass path capacity provisioning and usage. A
potential advantage of mutual backup through peering is that
the two networks involved tend to have similar geographic
coverage and thus the bypass paths are less likely to have
long detour delay.
• The second is a cost-free model without the requirement for
symmetry. For example, the backbone of the educational
Abilene network overlaps with many commercial IP networks.
Although in typical cases Abilene will not carry any com-
mercial trafﬁc, it is possible that Abilene can provide interdo-
main bypass paths for commercial networks in emergencies,
as these commercial networks are part of a critical national
infrastructure.
• The third is a provider-customer model. This is similar to
the traditional provider-customer relationship in the Inter-
net; that is, network A will pay network B to provide bypass
paths. The cost model can be either a ﬁxed pricing model or
a usage-based pricing model. The usage of the bypass paths
(e.g., in terms of amount of time and/or trafﬁc volume) may
be limited to avoid potential abuse. A bypass path provider
might charge lower prices just as some ISPs charge lower
prices for backup BGP links (e.g., shadow links of UUNet).

2.3 Signaling Interdomain Bypass Paths
We consider the case where network B provides interdomain by-
pass paths to network A. We assume A peers with B at multiple
locations referred to as points of presence (PoPs).
We emphasize that there can be multiple choices of protocols or
mechanisms for A and B to signal the interdomain bypass paths.
One possibility is manual conﬁguration. Since, as we will show
later, it typically needs only a small number of interdomain by-
pass paths between two neighboring networks, manual conﬁgura-
tion is possible and may be the preferred conﬁguration mechanism
in many setups. Below we present signaling based on BGP as it
does not require introducing a new protocol. In a cleaner signaling
mechanism, each network could setup a dedicated REIN server, and
the protocol we present below could be run over a TCP connection
between the two REIN servers.
Figure 2 shows the networks used in the description. To discover
interdomain bypass paths re-entering at border router a1 of net-
work A through neighboring network B, a1 makes a special BGP
announcement to its corresponding peer b1, over the existing eBGP
session between a1 and b1. The destination address of the BGP
announcement is a1. This BGP announcement can be considered
as a request for bypass paths in B through b1 back to a1. The
message could include additional attributes such as desired start-
ing points of the bypass paths (e.g., starting from a2 to B and then
to a1) and desirable bandwidth. The additional attributes are car-
ried as opaque attributes in the BGP message. The message carries
a unique BGP community tag REIN PATH REQUEST to enable
