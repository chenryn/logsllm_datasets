I attached a crash report as gist.  
Please have a look.
Our app is a corporate messenger with telephony and video meeting
capabilities.  
The version that is crashing was built for x64 arch and was running using
Rosetta on Apple M1 hardware.
The crash occurs sporadically. Users report that may happen suddenly when they
navigate thru the UI or start a telephony / video call. We use WebRTC features
and WebAssembly, fyi.
The crash I published were caught by Mac OS, despite we have a Sentry crash
reporter configured.
I see the stack trace from com.github.Electron.framework is not symbolicated,
so, probably not useful.  
Could you please suggest how to symbolicate it?
Will appreciate any help on this. Thanks.
