User: What editors or IDEs offer decent autocompletion for wxPython on Windows or Linux? Are there any? I tried several and support is either non-existant or limited.
Assistant: I'm partial to PyCharm. However, most IDEs will auto complete code based on what modules you've imported, so it's not specific to PyCharm.
