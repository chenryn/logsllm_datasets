User: I'm trying to add a python egg to my eclipse pydev path via Eclipse Settings -> PyDev -> Interpreter - Python -> New Egg/Zip(s), and in the dialog where I browse to the egg file, and click the "open" button on the dialog, it simply keeps the dialog open and browses into the egg.
This is on OS X with Helios SR 2.
Assistant: On my Mac I have some .egg's that are files, and some .egg's that are folders, for example my SQLObject is a folder but my oauth is a file.  I am not exactly sure why, it could be because of how I downloaded and installed them.
The ones that are folders can't be chosen by the "Add zip/jar/egg" chooser, but the simple solution is just to include those via "Add source folder".
