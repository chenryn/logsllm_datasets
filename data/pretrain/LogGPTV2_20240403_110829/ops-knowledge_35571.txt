User: Supposedly Python 2.7 is included native to OSX 10.8 and above (if I remember correctly), but I recently installed Python 3.5 to use for projects while I work through UDacity. Lo and behold, the UDacity courses seem to use 2.7 - wups! So instead of trying to uninstall 3.5 (this procedure seemed to scary for neophytes such as myself), I simply installed 2.7 in addition to the recently installed 3.5 and just run the 2.7 IDLE and Shell. Is this ok, or will I run into problems down the road?
Assistant: It should be fine. Its actually pretty common to have multiple Python environments. It helps to prevent dependency conflicts between your projects. That is what is happening when you are using tools like pyenv and virtualenv.
Using tools like pyenv and virtualenv may also help you with the path problems that others mentioned. They have commands to set up the path so that their version of pip, python, etc are used.
