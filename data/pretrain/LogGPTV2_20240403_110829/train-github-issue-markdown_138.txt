### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
May be needed to access.
### Describe the solution you'd like.
`.loc` and `.scale`, or methods.
### Describe alternatives you've considered.
No.
### Additional context (e.g. screenshots, GIFs)
Messing with args when differrent dists have different args and they can be
either keyword or positional ones is extremily inconvenient. `loc` and `scale`
are universal ones, so should be available easily.
