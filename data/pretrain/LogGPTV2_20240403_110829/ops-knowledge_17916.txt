Assistant: To design an efficient network architecture to ensure the stability and security of data transmission, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Design of network topology: A reasonable network topology can improve the availability and stability of the network. Common network topologies are star, ring, bus, tree and mesh. When designing a network topology, factors such as network scale, bandwidth, delay, and transmission distance need to be considered to achieve optimal performance and reliability. 2. Selection and configuration of network equipment: Network equipment includes routers, switches, firewalls, etc. It is necessary to select appropriate equipment according to the network scale and needs, and make appropriate configuration and adjustments to improve network performance and security. 3. Formulation of network security policies: Network security policies are the key to ensuring network security. Reasonable network security policies need to be formulated, including access control, data encryption, malware prevention, and vulnerability repair. 4. Network monitoring and management: Network monitoring and management can discover and solve network faults, and improve network reliability and stability. It is necessary to select the appropriate network monitoring tools and establish an effective network management mechanism. 5. Data backup and recovery: Data backup and recovery are important measures to ensure data security. It is necessary to select an appropriate backup plan and perform data backup and test recovery regularly to ensure that data can be recovered in time when network failures or security incidents occur.
