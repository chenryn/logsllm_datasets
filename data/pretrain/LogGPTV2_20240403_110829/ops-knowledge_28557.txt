User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Getting 408 errors on our logs with no request or user agent I'm getting a lot of requests turning up in our apache logs that look like this

www.example.com:80 10.240.1.8 - - [06/Mar/2013:00:39:19 +0000] "-" 408 0 "-" "-" -


There seems to be no request and no user agent.  Has anyone seen this before?

Assistant: Are you by any chance running your web servers in Amazon behind an Elastic Load Balancer?

It seems they generate a lot of 408 responses due to their health checks.

Some of the solutions from that forum thread:


RequestReadTimeout header=0 body=0

This disables the 408 responses if a request times out.
Change the ELB health check to a different port.
Disable logging for the ELB IP addresses with:

SetEnvIf Remote_Addr "10\.0\.0\.5" exclude_from_log
CustomLog logs/access_log common env=!exclude_from_log



And from this blog post:


Adjust your request timeout to be 60 or above.
