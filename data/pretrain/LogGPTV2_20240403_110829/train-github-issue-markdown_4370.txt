Hi, I'm using the experimental-allure-playwright reporter, I can change the
location of the "allure-report" folder by command line. However, it seems like
the "allure-results" folder is always saved in the main project directory ora
by setting it like an environmnet variable before launching the playwright
script. Since I'm running the playwright runner programmatically, what if I
wanted to programmatically set that path or by the playwright.config field? Is
there a way to do that? Thank you!
