## Context
I initially found the HOC pattern to be confusing, since (as a consumer) you
can't explicitly see what prop(s) are being added.
_(Also, it seems weird to create a component that can't stand on it's own, and
then wrap it into something that can.)_
Here is an explanation of the render-props pattern, which solves that (first)
problem to offer a better Developer eXperience:
