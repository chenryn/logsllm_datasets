Hello,
I was working on a personal project, and I could not figure out why my
expressions were not getting rebound in my views after new data. I was not
getting any compile or console errors. Eventually I found out that I was not
linking to angular2-polyfills in my index.html.
I know that the quickstart tutorial tells you to include the link, but I think
it would be helpful to raise some sort of error if angular2-polyfills is not
imported.
