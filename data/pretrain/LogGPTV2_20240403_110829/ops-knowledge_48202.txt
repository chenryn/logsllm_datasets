User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some running logs
 0 18:25:24,332 INFO Revalidating client: 0x14f05578bd80013
 1 16:09:22,982 INFO Notification: 2 (n.leader), 0xa0000009a (n.zxid), 0x1 (n.round), FOLLOWING (n.state), 1 (n.sid), 0xa (n.peerEPoch), LEADING (my state)

The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Notification time out: <*> 和 Received connection request /<*>:<*>
B: Notification: <*> (n.leader), <*> (n.zxid), <*> (n.round), FOLLOWING (n.state), <*> (n.sid), <*> (n.peerEPoch), LEADING (my state) 和 Revalidating client: <*>
C: Notification time out: <*> 和 Interrupted while waiting for message on queue
D: Connection broken for id <*>, my id = <*>, error = 和 Interrupting SendWorker
