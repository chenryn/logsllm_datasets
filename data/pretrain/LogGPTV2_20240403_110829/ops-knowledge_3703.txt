User: I can run the command line version of Python but I cannot seem to run it from the command prompt. I have recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8 and it worked fine with Windows 7. Now Windows 8 will not recognize Python. Thanks, William
Assistant: Go to C:\python33 or wherever you installed it.
Right click on "pythonw" and pin to taskbar,
Run from taskbar.
