TABLE VIII: Example of a feature ranking returned by Proﬁt
(in this case, for AIRPLAN 5).
by Proﬁt depends on the quality of the proﬁling-input suite.
Our ability to accurately quantify leakage is strongly linked to
our ability to accurately estimate the likelihood of collisions
between observations from different secrets. Ideally, we would
like to increase the size and diversity of our input set I to be as
close as possible to the input domain I, so that the probability
distribution of collisions would approach the real probability
distribution—that is, the one that we would see if we could
afford to execute the whole input domain I. If the input set I
is so small that it hardly ever causes any of those collisions,
leakage could be overestimated. On the other hand, if the suite
is too large, it may be unfeasible to execute it due to resource
constraints.
Normal distribution of feature values: Since we model the
probability density function for each secret with a Gaussian
curve, we are assuming that, for a given feature, and for each
secret, the probability of the feature given the secret should fol-
low an approximately normal distribution. If the user expects
signiﬁcantly different distributions, or if a goodness-of-ﬁt test
reveals that these distributions are far from being normal, one
may want to model the probability density functions using a
different kind of distribution.
One-dimensionality of
features: The feature space that
we consider in this work is intentionally limited to one-
