### Considerations for Feature Identification and Leakage Quantification

- **Quality of Profiling Input Suite:**
  - The accuracy of leakage quantification depends on the quality of the profiling input suite. To accurately estimate the likelihood of collisions between observations from different secrets, the input set should be as close as possible to the entire input domain. A small input set may overestimate leakage, while a large set may be unfeasible due to resource constraints.

- **Normal Distribution of Feature Values:**
  - We assume that the probability density function for each secret follows an approximately normal distribution. If the distributions are significantly different or not normal, alternative distribution models may be more appropriate.

- **One-Dimensionality of Features:**
  - The feature space considered in this work is intentionally limited to one-dimensional features. This simplification is necessary for the current analysis but may be expanded in future work.
