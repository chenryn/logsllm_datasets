## Abstract
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) allows Autonomous Systems (ASs) to apply diverse routing policies for selecting routes and propagating reachability information to other ASs. While numerous studies have focused on the Internet topology, little is known about the specific routing policies employed by network operators. This paper aims to infer and characterize the routing policies used in the Internet.

We find that routes learned from customers are generally preferred over those from peers and providers, with peer routes typically being preferred over provider routes. We present an algorithm for inferring and characterizing export policies, showing that ASs often announce their prefixes to a selected subset of providers. The primary reason for this selective announcement is traffic engineering, aimed at controlling incoming traffic. The impact of these routing policies can be significant; for example, many Tier-1 ASs reach their (direct or indirect) customers via their peers rather than directly. Furthermore, selective announcement implies that there are fewer available paths in the Internet than indicated by the AS connectivity graph. Our findings highlight the need for caution when choosing selective announcement policies for traffic engineering. Additionally, we study export policies to peers and find that ASs tend to announce all of their prefixes to other peers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study on understanding routing policies applied in the Internet.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet connects thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASs) operated by various administrative domains such as ISPs, companies, and universities. Inter-AS routing is determined by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). A key feature of BGP is its ability to allow ASs to adopt diverse routing policies to control route selection and propagate reachability information. For instance, a multihomed AS can control inbound traffic by announcing prefixes to a subset of its providers, thereby limiting reachability through specific providers. This means that connectivity does not necessarily imply reachability, as the extent of reachability is determined by both connectivity and routing policies.

Despite extensive research on Internet topology, little is known about the specific routing policies employed by network operators. Understanding these policies has several implications:
1. **Global View**: Each ISP has information about its own policies, but many ASs are reluctant to disclose them. The Internet Routing Registry (IRR) data is often incomplete or outdated, making it difficult to obtain a global view of typical routing policies.
2. **Internet Properties**: The global view of routing policies can affect important properties of the Internet, such as reachability and robustness. Selective announcement policies can lead to fewer available paths, impacting the overall robustness.
3. **Traffic Engineering**: Inference of other ASs' routing policies can aid in effective traffic engineering. Network operators can change their policies to shift traffic load among multiple candidate paths, which requires predicting these paths based on inferred policies.

In this paper, we first infer and characterize import routing policies, focusing on the preference settings for routes learned from providers, customers, and peers. We find that in most cases, route preferences align with AS relationships. We also present an algorithm for inferring export policies and characterize the selective announcement practices. Finally, we study export policies to peers and find that ASs tend to announce all of their prefixes to other peers.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Internet Architecture
- **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)**: Used for routing within ASs.
- **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**: Determines routing between ASs, including interior BGP (iBGP) and exterior BGP (eBGP).
- **AS Relationships**: Provider-to-customer and peer-to-peer relationships.
- **Annotated AS Graph**: Represents AS relationships using a graph with nodes as ASs and edges classified into provider-to-customer and peer-to-peer relationships.

### 2.2 Routing Policies
- **Import Policies**: Rules for selecting the best routes and assigning local preferences.
- **Export Policies**: Rules for determining whether to advertise the best route to neighbors, including permitting or denying routes, assigning MED, tagging BGP communities, and prepending AS paths.

## 3. Data Sources
We use data from the Oregon RouteView server and Looking Glass servers. The Oregon RouteView provides a global view of the routing system from various backbones and locations. On November 2002, it peered with 56 ASs, including nearly all Tier-1 ASs. We also use BGP tables from 15 ASs' Looking Glass servers, providing fine-grained routing information. Combining these sources, we have 68 routing tables from different ASs, spanning a wide range of sizes and geographic locations.

## 4. Inferring Import Policies
### 4.1 Route Preference Among Provider, Customer, and Peer Routes
BGP's default policy of selecting the shortest AS path can be overridden by setting local preferences. Network operators typically assign higher local preferences to customer routes, followed by peer routes, and then provider routes. We use BGP routing tables to infer these preferences and analyze their consistency with next-hop ASs.

### 4.2 Consistency Analysis
We define typical and atypical local preferences and find that the percentage of atypical local preferences is very small. To get a more complete view, we also use the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) to infer import policies, although the IRR data may be incomplete or outdated.

## 5. Inferring Export Policies
We present an algorithm for inferring and characterizing export policies, focusing on how ASs announce their prefixes to their (direct or indirect) providers. Our results show that a significant number of ASs announce their prefixes to a selected subset of providers, primarily for traffic engineering. We also study export policies to peers and find that ASs tend to announce all of their prefixes to other peers.

## 6. Conclusion
This paper presents the first systematic study on inferring and characterizing Internet routing policies. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preferences and practices of network operators, highlighting the importance of considering these policies in traffic engineering and network management.
