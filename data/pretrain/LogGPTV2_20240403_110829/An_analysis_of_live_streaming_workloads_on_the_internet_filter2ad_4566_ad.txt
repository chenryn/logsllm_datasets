UDP-dominant based on which protocol was used the most in that
region. For QuickTime and Real, roughly 50% of AS domains are
TCP-dominant, and over 25% of countries are TCP-dominant.
The transport protocol used by Windows Media, on the other
hand, is surprisingly different. TCP sessions are clearly the major-
ity, at 80% of all sessions, with HTTP dominating the other stream-
ing protocols. Microsoft’s proprietary streaming protocol, MMS,
is the second most used. To understand why there are much more
TCP sessions compared to the other streaming formats, we look
carefully at how the player probes the network. Version 9 of the
Windows Media Player uses the following prioritization by default:
(i) RTSP/TCP, (ii) RTSP/UDP, and (iii) HTTP, with MMS only used

as the last resort. Note that older players will strictly prioritize UDP
over TCP. However, our data shows that HTTP, not RTSP/TCP is
the dominant protocol. Looking further, perhaps our measurements
for Windows Media are capturing an Akamai-speci(cid:2)c server con-
(cid:2)guration that prioritizes HTTP connections. The reason for us-
ing HTTP is that it has been shown that HTTP scales better than
the other streaming protocols for the Windows Media Server [18].
Therefore, the numbers from Windows Media may not necessarily
be representative of transport protocol use on the Internet.
To summarize, we (cid:2)nd that roughly 40-50% of the AS domains
are TCP-dominant. We hypothesize that hosts from such domains
are behind NATs or (cid:2)rewalls that limit the range of UDP commu-
nications. This has implications on the deployment of UDP-based
congestion control protocols [10]. Deployment may be limited to
domains that allow UDP, and universal communications using UDP
may not be possible. In addition, our (cid:2)ndings have similar impli-
cations on the deployment of new applications and services in the
network, as they may need to be restricted to using TCP.
7. WHERE ARE HOSTS FROM?
In this section, we look at the distribution of clients tuning in to
live streaming media.
We answer the following questions:
 Where are clients from?
 What is the coverage of a stream?
 What is the relative distance between clients participating in
the same stream?
7.1 High›Level Characteristics
Figure 10 indicates where the clients of the DailyTop40 streams
are from. The x-axis is countries. The y-axis is the number of IP ad-
dresses from each country. The mapping from IP address to country
is obtained using the methodology described in Section 7.2. Over-
all, there are IP addresses from 223 countries in the trace, but for
presentation purposes we only show the 20 most common countries
in this (cid:2)gure. The country with the largest number of IP addresses
is the US, which has twice as many IP addresses as any of the next
4 countries: China, Germany, Spain, and France. The participation
from all of Europe dominates all other continents.
7.2 Granularity of Locations
We look at locations at four different granularities: AS do-
mains, cities, countries, and time zones. AS domains represent
network-level proximity. Geo-political regions of cities and coun-
tries provide us with insight into the diversity (or lack thereof) of
people who are tuning in to streams. This also provides us with in-
sight into whether or not Internet streaming is enabling new modes
of communications reaching wider audiences than traditional radio
or local TV stations which have physically concentrated audiences
(within a few towns or cities). In addition, we would like to know
how well the Internet’s truly (cid:147)global(cid:148) reach, crossing countries and
oceans, is currently being exploited. Time zones provide insight on
the relative distance between people. Perhaps people in the same
time zone are likely to have similar behavior compared to people
from different time zones due to time-of-day effects.
To map an IP address to a location, we use Akamai’s EdgeScape
tool, a commercial product that maps IP addresses to AS domains,
cities, countries, latitude-longitude positions, and many other geo-
graphic and network properties. The mapping algorithms are based
on many sources of information, some of which are host-names,
traceroute results, latency measurements, and registry information.
We have compared the EdgeScape IP-to-AS mapping with the map-
ping extracted from BGP routing tables available from the Route
Views project [20], and have found that the mappings are a near
perfect match. We also veri(cid:2)ed the country-level mapping, using
the freely available GeoIP database [17], and found the differences
between the EdgeScape and GeoIP to be negligible. We manu-
ally veri(cid:2)ed the city-level mapping for some DSL IP addresses and
university campuses (our own and others) and found it to be accu-
rate. More formal veri(cid:2)cation [16] showed that the mapping results
from EdgeScape are consistent with results from another commer-
cial mapping tool, Ixia’s IxMapper [13].
We note that EdgeScape does not provide us with time zone
information. We estimate the time zone by bucketing longitudes
into 15 degree increments, roughly corresponding to time zones.
7.3 Metrics
Next, we zoom in to each stream to better understand how
clients are distributed. We look at three metrics that capture client
diversity, clustering, and the distance between clients.
Diversity Index
Our (cid:2)rst metric, the diversity index is de(cid:2)ned as the number of
distinct (cid:147)locations(cid:148) (AS domains, cities, countries, or time-zones)
that a particular stream reaches. For example, if a stream is viewed
by only clients located in the United States, the country diversity
index is a low value of 1.
Clustering Index
The clustering index, our second metric captures how clustered
or skewed the client population is, and is de(cid:2)ned as the minimum
number of distinct locations that account for 90% of the IP ad-
dresses tuning in to each stream. For example, if 95% of clients
are located in the United States, 3% are in the UK, and 2% are in
Poland, the clustering index is 1. If the clustering index is small,
then only a small number of locations account for most of interests
in the streams.
Radius Index
The above two metrics give us a count on the number of distinct
locations, but does not provide us a proximity measure of how these
locations relate to one another. For example, if a stream covers 2
distinct time zones, are these time zones next to each other on the
same continent, or is one of them on one continent and the other
one on another continent halfway around the world? To capture
the distance between locations, we use the time zone radius index
which captures the spacing between client time zones.
To compute the radius index for each stream, we compute the
centroid time zone de(cid:2)ned as the time zone in which the average
distance between the centroid and all points (all time zones weighted

by the number of clients in each time zone) is minimized. For ex-
ample, for a stream in which there are people from two time zones,
half from the US East coast and the other half in the UK, the cen-
troid time zone would be somewhere in the middle in the Atlantic
Ocean. We then compute the distribution of clients as a function
of how far away they are from the centroid. Figure 11 depicts this
distribution for all large streams in the trace, each line representing
a stream. Note that for some streams, most of the mass is at 0 ra-
dius, meaning that most clients are in the same time zone. For a
few other streams, the peak is at 1, meaning most hosts are one time
zone away from the centroid. A peak at 6 means that most hosts
are 6 time zones away from the centroid. Location-wise, this means
that there are two large bodies of mass half-way around the world
(12 time zones) from each other. As a representative statistic, the
radius index is the minimum distance (radius) at which 90% of all
clients are covered. A small radius index means that most of the
population are (cid:147)close(cid:148) to each other, whereas a large index means
the population are (cid:147)far(cid:148) apart.
7.4 Large vs. Small Streams
Figure 12 depicts the diversity and clustering index for all Dai-
lyTop40 streams, separated into large vs. small streams. The indices
for AS domain and city granularities are shown in Figures 12(a) and
(b). Note that the two granularities look very similar. Perhaps this
re(cid:3)ects that there are a large number of small or regional AS do-
mains, and/or, that the EdgeScape mapping of IP address to city
may assign all IP addresses that belong to an AS to the same city
if it does not have any better information in its database. We wish
to make two observations. First, for large streams, the diversity of
AS domains (the right-most curve) is wide, ranging from 200-3,500
distinct domains. At the city-level, the diversity is also from 200-
3,500 cities. This range is much larger than traditional radio and TV
broadcasts that are physically limited to a few towns or cities. The
clustering index for large streams (second line from the right) is also
relatively large(cid:150)again, re(cid:3)ecting the wide coverage. Roughly 90%
of IP addresses are from 10-1,000 cities/AS domains. Second, the
diversity and clustering indices for smaller streams (the two lines
on the left) are generally smaller than large streams. However, the
index is still large in that half of the small streams cover 100 cities
or more! This re(cid:3)ects the power of the Internet as a transmission
medium as it does not share the same physical limitations on its
transmission range as traditional local radio or TV.
Next, we look at the country diversity and clustering indices in
