User: Please provide an Apache configuration file for deploying PHP based web application.
Assistant: The following is an Apache configuration file for deploying PHP-based web applications: ``` <VirtualHost *:80> ServerName example.com DocumentRoot /var/www/html <Directory "/var/www/html"> AllowOverride All Require all granted </Directory> ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined <FilesMatch \.php$> SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php7.4- fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/" </FilesMatch> </VirtualHost> ``` Note that this configuration file assumes your web application is located in the /var/www/html directory and uses PHP 7.4 Runs as FPM (FastCGI Process Manager). Since we use a UNIX socket to handle PHP requests, we specify a proxy:unix handler and connect it to our PHP-FPM socket. Additionally, we enabled local configuration of .htaccess files and allowed all requests to access all files under the DocumentRoot. Finally, we write the error log to the error.log file in the Apache log directory, write the access log to the access.log file, and specify in the <FilesMatch> directive that all .php files be processed with php-fpm.
