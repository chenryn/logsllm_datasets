### Problem description
I am trying to wrap ListItem into a custom component to reduce
boilerplate/duplicates in my code.  
Original code:
            } value="/base32"/>,
                } value="/base32Hex"/>,
                } value="/base64"/>,
                } value="/base64url"/>,
                } value="/hex"/>
as you can see - a lot of duplicities (running version to be inspected can be
found here).
So I decided to wrap the component to get rid of duplicates:
    const MenuItem = ({anchor, ...other}) => (
    );
But the menu item is no longer selectable (try difference between these two
sementically identical approaches)
    const App = () => (
         {/* Change here to /mi, update, run -> MenuItem is not selected */}
    );

I have asked on StackOverflow and user Chris pointed out the probable cause. I
would create a PR, but I am just a beginner when it comes to React, so my
repair would probably cause more harm than good :-).
