User: what happens to my script in python that does not run through crontab every minute.
My script has execute permissions and then calls two other scripts in python.

This is the content of my crontab (#crontab -l):
*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/rsm/samplesMonitor.py

Thank you guys.
Assistant: It should be */1 instead of *\1 (forward slash instead of backslash). Also, make sure the path is correct; there usually are no subdirectories under /usr/bin.
