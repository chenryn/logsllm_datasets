The protected ServletRequestAttributes#getSession(boolean ) method returns a
null session on child threads.  
This is wrong because it doesn't get into account what happens in the
constructor:
[code]  
public ServletRequestAttributes(HttpServletRequest request) {  
Assert.notNull(request, "Request must not be null");  
this.request = request;  
// Fetch existing session reference early, to have it available even  
// after request completion (for example, in a custom child thread).  
this.session = request.getSession(false);  
}  
[/code]
I think that the following code into the getSession method:
[code]  
this.session = this.request.getSession(allowCreate);  
return this.session;  
[/code]
Should be as follows:
[code]  
HttpSession newSession = this.request.getSession(allowCreate);  
if (newSession != null) {  
this.session = newSession;  
}  
return this.session;  
[/code]
