User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the function of the cimserver daemon? I noticed in /var/log/messsages a process 'cimserver' was logging some interesting messages:

Nov 27 15:33:37 lb-web-standby cimserver[2250]: Failed to deliver an indication: Cannot 
connect to the-hostname-of-the-server-im-current-on:49152. Connection failed.
Nov 27 15:33:37 lb-web-standby cimserver[2250]: Failed to deliver an indication: 
Invalid locator: the-hostname-of-the-server-im-current-on:49152


I did a little digging and I was able to find a command reference for cimserver online, but no details as to what task it specifically performs. I know that CIM stands for the Common Information Model in computing, but I don't understand why there is a daemonized task running on our box related to this. What exactly does this process do and why is it giving connection errors in the log?

Assistant: The cimserver daemon is simply a server daemon that allows connections using the Common Information Model.  It's typically used by vendors and OEMs as a way for their management and monitoring software and/or services to connect to their servers.

HP uses it for their WBEM Services, IBM uses it (among other things) for their Performance Expert DB2 monitoring software, Cisco uses it for SAN management, VMware uses it for hardware monitoring, Dell uses it for their OpenManage remote management and server monitoring packages (though I can't find a link for that which isn't a .pdf), and other vendors and OEMs use it for similar purposes.

You haven't provided enough inofrmation to determine precisely what it's being used for on your system, or diagnose the errors, except to say that it expecting to connect to something on port 49152, and can't, hence the error.
