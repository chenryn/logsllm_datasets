Windows 8.1
Every time I open atom (without passing any location or file to open), it
opens up with an empty editor pane as expected.
But when I press Ctrl-\ the tree view does not open.  
If I go to "Toggle Tree View" from the menu, it also does nothing, no matter
how often I click it or hit the key binding.
Only after opening a new window, e.g. by opening a folder or file via the
menu, does the toggling work again and the tree view responds.
