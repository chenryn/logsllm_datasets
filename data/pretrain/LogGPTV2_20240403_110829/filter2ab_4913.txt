**ATT&CK ID:** T1546.010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** AppInit DLLs

Adversaries may use AppInit DLLs to establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious code. This technique involves loading dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes through the `AppInit_DLLs` registry value. Specifically, the `AppInit_DLLs` value is located in the following registry keys:

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows`

When a process loads `user32.dll`, it also loads any DLLs specified in the `AppInit_DLLs` value. Since `user32.dll` is a common library used by nearly all Windows applications, this method can effectively inject malicious code into a wide range of processes, thereby enabling persistent execution and potential privilege escalation.
