Detected under valgrind, and looking at the code, it looks like there is a
problem, but I don't know enough about that code to solve it quickly:

The problem is inside the macro PyArrayIter_GOTO: some items of the argument
destination are accessed without having been set previously (when they are
swapped with the copyswap function).
