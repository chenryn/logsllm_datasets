Yazov: 
TS [Thread Starter] laundered $300, 
the speed is comparable to the 
second cosmic speed.  Everything 
was magnificent, I’ll go back 
Avatar: 
I did some laundering of money from 
a female partner, everything was 
quick and excellent and he [the TS] 
takes a small percentage, which also 
makes one happy.

there are no logs to back up his claim. Moderator please ban him.

Oversight of User 
Behavior 
Forum Administration 
• Forum Admins and Moderators can also manage the activities of 
users through bans 
– To leave fictitious rules in topics.  The fact that a transaction has 
been carried out must be confirmed by the appropriate proof 
upon the first request of the administration.  If this cause is 
violated, the user leaving a fictitious review will be banned, and 
perhaps even permanently..   
– To leave the following type of message: “TS [Thread Starter] is a 
burner [rip off artist] you shouldn’t have anything to do with 
him.” We will immediately post the logs proving guilt.. 
– Reviews from users with 1-10 messages who have not been on 
the forum for long will be deleted at the discretion of the 
moderator.

Estimates of Buyer Profits 
• Estimating gains for data buyers is much more 
complex 
– Likelihood of ripping may be high 
– There is an expectation that not all data will be 
functional 
• Estimates of direct funds acquired by identity thieves 
in the US in 2012 
– Credit card= ave.=$1,448; median= $300 
– Debit card= ave.=$552; median= $200 
Estimated ROI: Dumps 
• There were 117 instances of positive feedback from 
dumps sales 
– Assuming 65 cards are valid and active, the ROI 
varies based on what metric is used 
• Credit Card Loss Average 
–($94,120-$10,260)/$10,260= 8.17 ROI 
• Credit Card Loss Median 
–($19,500-$10,260)/$10,260= 0.9 ROI 
– Using the median loss, buyers could gain 
$2,281,500 
Estimated ROI: Dumps 
• There were 117 instances of positive feedback from 
dumps sales 
– Assuming 65 cards are valid and active, the ROI 
varies based on what metric is used 
• Debit Card Loss Average 
–($35,880-$10,260)/$10,260= 2.49 ROI 
• Debit Card Loss Median 
–($13,000-$10,260)/$10,260= 0.26 ROI 
– Using the median loss, buyers could gain 
$1,521,000 
Estimated ROI: eBay/PayPal 
• There is only one instance of positive feedback 
– Assuming 25 accounts are operational, the ROI is 
improved from that of dumps 
• Credit Card Loss Average 
– ($36,200-$1,362.50)/$1,362.50= 25.5 ROI 
• Credit Card Loss Median 
– ($7,500-$1,362.50)/$1,362.50= 4.5 ROI 
• Debit Card Loss Average 
– ($13,800-$1,362.50)/$1,362.50= 9.12 ROI 
• Debit Card Loss Median 
– ($5,000-$1,362.50)/$1,362.50= 2.66 ROI

Discussion 
•The forums appear to be organized at two levels 
•The sales process blurs the line between colleagues 
and peers 
•The forums comprise teams and formal 
organizations 
• The network of stolen data markets are generally 
inefficient  
• Variations across stolen data markets based on 
centrality of users by status and participation  
Market Disruption 
• Based on our analyses, disruption should 
focus on the entire forum rather than 
individual sellers or Sybil attacks 
– Dark Market 
• Pursue and prosecute payment services for 
their role in facilitating illicit transactions 
– Short term benefit, but long term impact 
Evaluation and Partnerships 
• There is a substantial need for law 
enforcement and academic partnerships 
– Vetted forums are the key vehicle but are closed 
off from general access 
– Evaluate and capture off-forum communications 
– Assess the impact of disruption methods on 
market operations 
Further Research 
• There is a need for substantial additional research  
– Data collection and analysis of various forums and 
IRC channels to validate findings  
– Data from either current or recently shut down 
PMs and ICQ communications to understand 
difference between advertised and negotiated 
price  
– Exploration of social network position relative to 
advertised price  
– Additional research on payment mechanisms and 
their influence on price
