### Sales Process and Social Organization

#### Sales Process
- **Seller Posts an Ad in the Forum:**
  - The seller advertises their services or products in a dedicated forum.
- **Sales Occur Via ICQ/Email/Jabber:**
  - Buyers place orders and pay for services electronically using methods such as Liberty Reserve, WebMoney (WM), Western Union, MoneyGram, or escrow payments involving other forum users.

#### Sales Process Facilitators
- **Guarantor Services:**
  - Guarantors are provided to ensure that neither party is deceived during transactions.
  - **Terms for Working Through a Guarantor:**
    1. Both the buyer and seller must agree to use a guarantor.
    2. Both parties must contact the guarantor via ICQ.
    3. One party gives the money to the guarantor, and the other provides the goods.
    4. The guarantor's services are free up to $30, with fees ranging from 8% for transactions up to 500 WMZ, 6% for 500-3000 WMZ, and 5% for over 3000 WMZ.

#### Customer Feedback
- **Customer Feedback in the Forum:**
  - Buyers leave feedback on their experiences, which can influence future sales.
  - **Example Feedback:**
    - **Yazov:** "TS [Thread Starter] laundered $300, the speed was impressive. Everything was magnificent, I’ll be back."
    - **Avatar:** "I did some laundering of money from a female partner, everything was quick and excellent, and he [the TS] takes a small percentage, which is also good."
    - **Hans:** "Has your service been tested or vouched? I can provide potential business for you in carding items…"
    - **Bitmore:** "He is a ripper!!! Don't believe him! His drops are from Florida."
    - **Dentmer:** "I am no ripper, I have never had a complaint. This poster just wants to cause trouble. As you can see, there are no logs to back up his claim. Moderator, please ban him."
    - **Kimpo:** "I have contacted him on another forum. I asked if he would accept escrow for guarantee, and he refused!"

#### Social Organization
- **Product Reviews:**
  - Sellers post ads in the forum, and customer feedback is posted in the same forum.
  - **Moderator Review/Approval:**
    - Goods are checked voluntarily or at the request of the forum administration.
    - The check is conducted by a designated moderator and lasts one to three days.
    - After the check, the moderator ensures that there are no negative discussions about the product and writes a review before closing the topic.
    - Refusal to provide a product for testing can result in a ban and the deletion of the announcement.

- **Administrative Oversight:**
  - **Forum Admins and Moderators:**
    - Manage user behavior through bans and oversight.
    - Fictitious reviews or unverified claims can lead to bans.
    - Reviews from new users (with 1-10 messages) may be deleted at the moderator's discretion.

### Macro-Level Organization
- **Forums as Formal Organizations:**
  - Forums serve as marketplaces for buying and selling.
  - They have a managerial structure and connections between different forums.
  - These forums have a long-term duration and act as formal organizations.

    - Total: 119 non-ripping, 63 ripping, total 182.

- **Estimating Gains:**
  - Estimating gains for buyers is complex due to the likelihood of ripping and the expectation that not all data will be functional.
  - Estimated direct funds acquired by identity thieves in the US in 2012:
    - Credit Card: Average = $1,448, Median = $300.
    - Debit Card: Average = $552, Median = $200.

- **Estimated ROI: Dumps**
  - 117 instances of positive feedback.
  - Assuming 65 cards are valid and active:
    - **Credit Card Loss:**
      - Average: ($94,120 - $10,260) / $10,260 = 8.17 ROI.
      - Median: ($19,500 - $10,260) / $10,260 = 0.9 ROI.
      - Using the median loss, buyers could gain $2,281,500.
    - **Debit Card Loss:**
      - Average: ($35,880 - $10,260) / $10,260 = 2.49 ROI.
      - Median: ($13,000 - $10,260) / $10,260 = 0.26 ROI.
      - Using the median loss, buyers could gain $1,521,000.

- **Estimated ROI: eBay/PayPal**
  - One instance of positive feedback.
  - Assuming 25 accounts are operational:
    - **Credit Card Loss:**
      - Average: ($36,200 - $1,362.50) / $1,362.50 = 25.5 ROI.
      - Median: ($7,500 - $1,362.50) / $1,362.50 = 4.5 ROI.
    - **Debit Card Loss:**
      - Average: ($13,800 - $1,362.50) / $1,362.50 = 9.12 ROI.
      - Median: ($5,000 - $1,362.50) / $1,362.50 = 2.66 ROI.

### Discussion
- **Organizational Levels:**
  - Forums appear to be organized at two levels: the sales process and the social organization.
  - The sales process blurs the line between colleagues and peers.
  - Forums comprise teams and formal organizations.
  - The network of stolen data markets is generally inefficient, with variations based on user centrality.

### Market Disruption
- **Disruption Strategies:**
  - Focus on disrupting the entire forum rather than individual sellers or Sybil attacks.
  - Pursue and prosecute payment services for their role in facilitating illicit transactions, providing short-term benefits and long-term impact.

### Evaluation and Partnerships
- **Law Enforcement and Academic Partnerships:**
  - There is a substantial need for partnerships between law enforcement and academia.
  - Vetted forums are key but are closed off from general access.
  - Evaluate and capture off-forum communications.
  - Assess the impact of disruption methods on market operations.

### Further Research
- **Research Needs:**
  - Substantial additional research is needed.
  - Data collection and analysis of various forums and IRC channels to validate findings.
  - Data from current or recently shut down PMs and ICQ communications to understand the difference between advertised and negotiated prices.
  - Exploration of social network position relative to advertised price.
  - Additional research on payment mechanisms and their influence on price.
