still cant write any "@"
what is so dificult to change that? i know 2 types of keyboards... the ones
with the @ on the number key "2" and the one with the "@" on the "Q"
you just have to remove the shortcut on alt(right) + "Q"
you CANT work with atom in EUROPE!!! the keyboards in europe have the @ on the
"Q"-key
