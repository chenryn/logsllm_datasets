choice of the lookup quorum results in the same intersection
probability as a random one. The most interesting fact about
the UNIQUE-PATH strategy is the extremely small number
of messages it sends. Surprisingly, accessing a target quorum
of size 1Q I requires fewer than IQ 1 messages, including the
reply message! This happens due to the early halting. When
a quorum of target size IQI is accessed, the first hit occurs
at approximately half of the way. Thus, an average of IQI/2
messages are sent until hit. The reply follows the reverse
path, but due to the path reduction optimization, the reply
path length is usually shorter. In addition, the originator of
the lookup includes itself in the lookup quorum, which
reduces the number of messages by one.
We use a salvation technique to prevent dropping of RW
messages. If node v does not succeed to forward a RW mes(cid:173)
sage to the neighbor chosen in a given step, v makes a new
attempt to send this message to another random neighbor.
RANDOM advertise with FLOODING lookup. Fig(cid:173)
ures 6(a) and 6(b) depict the performance of the FLOODING
access strategy. The hit ratio grows super linearly with TTL.
For example, for 800 nodes, a hit ratio of 0.5 is achieved for
TTL=2, whereas a hit ratio of 0.85 is achieved for TTL=3.
The number of messages sent by FLOODING is quite small
and is comparable to the PATH strategy. However, notice that
in order to increase the hit ratio to 0.9 in a network of 800
nodes one has to increase the TTL to 4, resulting in a sig-

messages with TIL 3, FLOODING with TIL 4 sends 35 mes(cid:173)
sages (this is both due to the increased flooding scope and ad(cid:173)
ditional reply messages). This demonstrates the biggest disad(cid:173)
vantage of the FLOODING strategy: the lack of a fine grained
control over the intersection probability. This is in contrast
to the PATH strategy. In mobile networks, FLOODING per(cid:173)
forms quite similar to static networks and is thus not depicted.
UNIQUE-PATH advertise with UNIQUE-PATH
lookup. As proven in Theorem 5.3, in this combination, at
least one of the RWs has to be of length n(10~ n ). Figure 6(c)
depicts the hit ratio for various RW TTL values for a net(cid:173)
work of 800 nodes. Both advertise and lookup were
accessed by UNIQUE-PATH, rather than by PATH, which
considerably improved their performance. We can see that a
0.9 hit ratio is achieved when the length of advertise RW
and lookup RW together is around 350, almost n/2. Thus,
if both walks use the same TTL, it must equal approximately
175 ~ 1.5 10; n ~ n/5. For such a choice of TTLs, the
number of messages of the lookup access is about TTL/2,
since the first hit occurs at approximately half the way.

Quorum systems.
Quorum systems were initially used
in [14] and [13]. Bi-quorums were introduced in [29]. Her-
lihy used quorums and consensus to implement shared objects
in [19]. Other quorum based implementations of distributed
shared objects include [2, 25]. Probabilistic quorum systems
were initially introduced by Malkhi et al [27].
Reconfigurable quorum systems were first explored by
Herlihy [20], followed by the dynamic reconfigurable mecha(cid:173)
nisms of [25] and [1], yet without analyzing the failure proba(cid:173)
bility of a single quorum. Both methods are unsuitable for ad
hoc networks due to their large message complexity.
A probabilistic quorum system for sensor networks ap(cid:173)
pears in [8]. The access to both write and read quorums is
performed by flooding (gossiping) a corresponding request
throughout the entire network.
In writes, the data is saved
by 8(n) nodes, yet only 8(logn) nodes send an acknowl(cid:173)
edgement. For reads, the ids of 8 (log n) random nodes are
included in the header of the corresponding message; only
these nodes are supposed to send a reply to the read request.
Quorum Based Location Services. One of the most widely
used application of quorums in ad hoc networks thus far has
been in implementing location service. Examples of quorum(cid:173)
based location services include, [31], Octopus [28], GLS [21],
and GCLP [32]. All those works differ from our in that most
of them use geographic knowledge, do not use probabilistic
quorums and do not utilize a-symmetric quorum systems.
In the work of Haas and Liang [18], a uniform random quo(cid:173)
rum system is used for mobility management. Nodes form a

virtual backbone. When a node moves, it updates its location
with one quorum containing the nearest backbone node. Each
source node then queries the quorum containing its nearest
backbone for the location of the destination. The selection of
nodes into quorums is done randomly during runtime.
In [23, 24] both read and write quorums are random subsets
of nodes. The write quorum is accessed by random gossip,
which also constructs random membership. The read quorum
is accessed by contacting a set of random nodes picked out of
the random membership directly (relying on routing), in the
same way as in our RANDOM access. Our work could be
seen as a generalization [24], since it provides a number of
alternative quorum access strategies, while [24] only provides
RANDOM advertise x RANDOM lookup.
In GeoQuorums [10], geometric coordinates determine the
location of home servers. These focal point coordinates define
geographic areas that must be inhibited by at least one server
at any time. Sets of focal points are organized in intersecting
quorums. The quorums are further used to implement atomic
memory abstraction in mobile ad hoc networks.
In [6], a location service is implemented through randomly
selected quorums. Yet, no means are provided in [6] to deter(cid:173)
mine the required size of the random quorum and no theoreti(cid:173)
cal evaluation of the quorum selection algorithms is supplied.
9 Discussion
We have explored various access strategies for implement(cid:173)
ing probabilistic bi-quorum systems in ad hoc networks.
In
particular, we have shown that asymmetric bi-quorums can
offer better performance than symmetric ones. Moreover, we
have shown that even without geographical knowledge, it is
possible to obtain efficient quorums. The bi-quorum system
we have found most efficient is the one that uses RANDOM
for advertise and PATH for lookup (or vice versa). This
is due to the use of random walks in PATH, which eliminates
the need for multiple hop routing.
An appealing application of quorums is distributed shared
objects. It was shown in [2] that atomic registers can be imple(cid:173)
mented using quorums. Yet, such an implementation requires
both read and write operations to access one adve rt i s e and
one lookup quorum (with some known optimizations).
