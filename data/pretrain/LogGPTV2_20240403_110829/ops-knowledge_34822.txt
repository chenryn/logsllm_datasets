User: In Celery's logs there are 
Task blabla.bla.bla[arguments] succeeded in 0.757446050644s: None
How to replace this None with something more meaningfull? I tried to set return value in tasks but no luck.
Assistant: Are you defining your tasks with ignore_result=True (or did you set CELERY_IGNORE_RESULT to True)? If you did, you should try disabling it.
