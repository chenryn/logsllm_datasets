### Effects of Submarine Cable Deployment on Internet Routing

#### Performance Improvements and Degradations

One would expect the most significant performance improvements for virtual probes (VPs) in Africa and South America, particularly those close to the new submarine cable. Figures 2B1 and 2B2 confirm this expectation for communications from South America crossing the South Atlantic Cable System (SACS). For instance, before SACS was launched, traffic from Brazil to Angola via the West Africa Cable System (WACS) had to pass through São Paulo, London/Lisbon, and Sangano, traversing twice the great-circle distance between Brazil and Angola. This resulted in a round-trip time (RTT) of at least 279 ms. With SACS, the RTT dropped to as low as 108 ms. These statistics are consistent with previous findings [36].

In contrast, Figures 2D1 and 2D2 show only a slight RTT decrease (10 ms, or 3%) for VPs in Africa, comparable to the decrease observed for VPs in North America (Figures 2E1 and 2E2). Figure 3 highlights that the most significant RTT reductions were on paths from South America to Angola (226 ms, a 67% drop), South Africa (199 ms, a 55% drop), and Nigeria (138 ms, a 46% drop). However, these drops were at least twice the percentage reduction observed on paths from Africa to Brazil (73 ms, a 21% drop). For example, IP paths from Dar-es-Salam (TZ) used to traverse Mombassa (KE), London (UK), Paris (FR), Amsterdam (NL), and Miami (US) to reach Brazil. Post-SACS, these paths switched to Mombassa (KE), Marseille (FR), Madrid (ES), Lisbon (PT), Sangano (AO), and then Brazil. We will examine these circuitous paths and their causes in Section 4.2.

Our dataset confirms that for pairs from South Africa to Brazil, the observed minimum RTTs decreased from 298 ms to 116 ms [60]. Minimum RTTs also decreased by 44% for pairs from Zambia, 35% for pairs from Nigeria, and 3.5% for pairs from Ghana to prefixes in Brazil. However, the dataset also reveals performance degradations, such as increased RTTs for most VPs in Europe and Asia (Figures 2G and F). The largest RTT increase occurred for pairs sourced from Africa to Angola (241 ms, a 161% increase), which surprisingly crossed SACS after its launch (Figure 3). Other notable increases include paths from North America to Brazil (189 ms, a 123% increase), Europe to Angola (102 ms, a 69% increase), and Africa to China (a 24% increase).

#### Effects on Country Paths and Transit ASes Serving Forward Paths

We investigated the changes in forward paths from South America, Africa, and Europe to Angola. Before SACS, packets from South America to Angola first traveled to Europe and then went through the WACS cable [59] to Angola (inferred via hostnames indicating WACS landing points). Angola Cables (AC) served 46% of the observed pairs. After SACS, all observed pairs transited through AC, leveraging SACS for lower latency (Figure 4A). Figure 4B shows paths from Europe to Angola, where the use of SACS increased latency due to higher propagation delay and an increase in the number of transited routers (Figures 2G1 and G2).

Figure 5 illustrates how, after SACS, a high proportion of observed paths for certain continent/destination country pairs followed circuitous paths within AC’s network, crossing the sea multiple times. We computed the AS-centrality (Section 2.1) of ASes within the forward paths and inferred the top three transit ASes that serve most pairs (Table 1). After SACS, the same top two ASes remained, although the AS-centrality of AC shifted to 90%. However, observed packets routed within AC took suboptimal routes: for 27.2% of pairs, packets routed via Cape Town/Johannesburg (ZA) traveled an additional 13,502 km, and for another 55% of pairs, packets entering AC through London traveled an additional 7,081 km. Suboptimal paths from Africa (through Europe, possibly North America, and Brazil) to Angola, inducing the RTT increase of 241 ms post-SACS, were either due to suboptimality within AC itself or to neighbors routing packets towards AC even though going through SACS was not the shortest route anymore (Figure 5A).

The next largest median RTT increase was for paths from North America to Brazil, which rose by 187 ms (123%) for observed pairs in this category. Figure 5 shows two trajectories used by 25% of these paths: from North America, packets crossed Europe or Asia, entered AC Points of Presence (PoPs) at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in South Africa, then went to Angola before crossing SACS to Brazil. This proves the existence of a direct link from South Africa to Angola (via WACS), making the suboptimal African paths previously mentioned even more curious.

Paths from Europe to Angola showed a median increase of 102 ms (69%). Figure 5 shows the trajectory of such paths sourcing from Europe and entering AC in Europe before going to Brazil and crossing SACS, on their way to their destinations in Angola. Our dataset indicates that after SACS, 99% of paths went through Fortaleza within AC’s network, compared to none before. Since using the WACS cable was still an option for AC post-SACS, there was suboptimal routing within AC for this category. Packets routed this way traveled roughly 6,435 km more than when they went from London (UK) to Luanda (AO) through WACS.

Conversely, the largest median RTT decrease (38%) corresponds to paths from South America to Angola: 99% of observed paths directly traversed SACS when routed within AC, enabling packets to travel a great-circle distance of 6,641 km less than before. This case demonstrates that optimal routing within AC’s network can indeed substantially improve end-to-end performance for the AS paths it serves.

We observed only a third of such improvement from Africa to Brazil (a drop of 73 ms, or 21%). Further investigation revealed cases of suboptimal interdomain routing for paths going notably from Mauritius, Ghana, Tanzania, South Africa, or Zambia to Brazil via cities on other continents, which result from the persistent lack of peering among neighboring ASes [29,30,32,34].

We then used Figure 3 and Table 1 to check whether SACS introduced new backup IP paths between the regions AC connected. No observed pairs hinted at the existence of paths from South America to Europe/Asia via SACS and Africa. Instead, paths from North America toward destinations in Africa via SACS benefited from an RTT decrease of at least 20 ms; SACS could thus play the role of a valid backup path for North American ASes to reach African countries or could be used for load balancing purposes. We also checked whether AC received/routed packets post-SACS through new IXPs. Before the SACS launch, AC was present at public peering points spanning five continents [3,4,47]. We observed AC peering at five additional IXPs (in UK, US, BR, and RU) post-SACS for the same set of pairs, indicating an expanded interconnection footprint.
