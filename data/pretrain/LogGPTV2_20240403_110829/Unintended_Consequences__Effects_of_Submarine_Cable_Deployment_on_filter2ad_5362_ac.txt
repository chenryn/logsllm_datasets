ments for VPs in Africa and South America, i.e., close to the cable. Figure 2B1
and 2B2 show that this is the case for communications from South America cross-
ing SACS. For example, before SACS launch, traﬃc from Brazil to Angola via
AC visited S˜ao Paulo, London/Lisbon, and Sangano via the WACS cable [59],
traversing double the great-circle distance between Brazil and Angola, before
reaching Luanda (AO) with an RTT of at least 279 ms. The use of SACS dropped
this RTT to a low of 108 ms. These statistics are consistent with those AC pre-
sented in [36].
In contrast, Fig. 2D1 and 2D2 reveal only a slight RTT decrease (10 ms i.e.,
3%) for VPs in Africa, comparable to that of VPs in North America (Fig. 2E1
and 2E2). While Fig. 3 shows that the most signiﬁcant RTT drops are on paths
from South America to Angola (226 ms a 67% drop), South Africa (199 ms, a 55%
drop), and Nigeria (138 ms, a 46% drop), it shows that these are all at least twice
the percent drop observed on paths from Africa to Brazil (73 ms, a 21% drop). In
fact, IP paths from, for instance, Dar-es-Salam (TZ) traversed Mombassa (KE),
London (UK), Paris (FR), Amsterdam (NL), Miami (US) to reach Brazil before
SACS deployment, and switched to Mombassa (KE), Marseille (FR), Madrid
(ES), Lisbon (PT), Sangano (AO), and Brazil after SACS. We inspect these
circuitous paths and their causes in Sect. 4.2.
Our dataset conﬁrms that, for  pairs from South Africa toward Brazil
that beneﬁted from SACS, observed minimum RTTs decreased from 298 ms to
116 ms (highlighted in [60]). Minimum RTTs decreased 44% for  pairs
from Zambia, 35% for those from Nigeria and 3.5% from Ghana toward pre-
ﬁxes in Brazil. The dataset also reveals performance degradations e.g., for RTTs
from most VPs in Europe and Asia (Fig. 2G and F). From the inspection of
performance per continents/countries destination, we learned that the biggest
RTT increase occurred for  pairs sourced from Africa to Angola (241 ms
i.e., 161%), which surprisingly crossed SACS after its launch (Fig. 3). This is
followed by cases of paths from North America to Brazil (189 ms increase i.e.,
123%), Europe to Angola (102 ms – 69%), and Africa to China (24%).
4.2 Eﬀects on Country Paths and Transit ASes Serving Forward
Paths
We investigated the change in forward paths from South America, Africa, and
Europe to Angola. Before using SACS, packets from South America to Angola
ﬁrst traveled to Europe, and then went through the existing WACS cable [59] to
Angola (inferred via hostnames that indicate WACS landing points). AC served
46% of  pairs observed by both Ark and Atlas VPs. After SACS, paths
for all observed  pairs transited through AC, leveraging SACS for lower
latency (Fig. 4A). Figure 4B shows paths from Europe to Angola, where the
forward paths crossed SACS instead of the existing WACS. In this case, the use
of SACS increased latency due to higher propagation delay and an increase in
the number of transited routers (Fig. 2G1 and G2).

of  pairs crossed Europe and then An-
gola via AC. SACS provided to all measured
 pairs a more direct path between these
two continents and improved performance.
(B) Partial AS paths from Europe to Angola.
AC was the major transit provider for traf-
ﬁc from Europe to Angola throughout the en-
tire period of study. However, the use of SACS
within AC signiﬁcantly lengthened the physical
path, and thus the latency of the forward path.
Fig. 4. Impact of SACS deployment on the set of transit cases on observed paths
going from South America to Angola (RTT improvement) and from Europe to Angola
(RTT degradation). The white ovals inside AC are part of traceroutes post-SACS we
manually geolocated using hints in hostnames.
Figure 5 illustrates how, after SACS, a high proportion of observed paths
for certain continent/destination country pairs followed circuitous paths within
AC’s network, crossing the sea multiple times.
We computed the AS-centrality (Sect. 2.1) of ASes within the forward paths
and inferred the top three transit ASes that serve most  pairs (Table 1).
After SACS, the same top two ASes remained, although the AS-centrality of
AC shifted to 90%. However, observed packets routed within AC took a sub-
optimal route: for 27.2% of  pairs, packets routed within AC via Cape
Town/Johannesburg (ZA) traveled a great-circle distance of 13,502 km more
than before SACS, while for another 55% of  pairs, packets entering AC
through London traveled 7,081 km more than before SACS. Suboptimal paths
from Africa (through Europe, possibly North America, and Brazil) to Angola
inducing the RTT increase of Fig. 3 (241 ms) post-SACS were either due to sub-
optimality within AC itself or to neighbors that were routing packets towards AC
even though going through SACS was not the shortest route anymore. Figure 5A
depicts how 55% of paths originating in diﬀerent African countries entered AC
either through South Africa, via Europe down to Brazil, and crossed SACS before
landing in Angola.
The next largest median RTT increase was for paths from North America
to Brazil, which rose 187 ms (123%) for observed  pairs of this category.
Figure 5 shows two trajectories used by 25% of these paths: from North America,
packets crossed Europe or Asia, enter AC PoPs at IXPs in South Africa, then
all went to Angola before crossing SACS to Brazil: this proves the existence of
a direct link from South Africa to Angola (via WACS), making the suboptimal
African paths previously mentioned even more curious. All three most-central

post-SACS are in italic. Although all our pre-selected paths post-SACS cross SACS,
AC may still have an AS-centrality lower than 100%, since the AS-centrality does not
account for cases where the AS is either the source or the destination of the AS path.

ASes for the same pairs changed after SACS launch, with a higher AS-centrality
and 100% of  pairs were served by AC post-SACS (Table 1).
Paths from Europe to Angola showed a median increase of 102 ms (69%).
Figure 5 shows the trajectory of such paths sourcing from Europe and entering
AC in Europe before going to Brazil and crossing SACS, on their way to their
destinations in Angola. We learned from our dataset that after SACS, 99% of
paths went through Fortaleza within AC’s network vs. none before. Since using
the WACS cable was an option for AC post-SACS, there was suboptimal routing
within AC for this category. Packets routed this way traveled roughly 6,435 km
more than when they went from London (UK) to Luanda (AO) through WACS.
Conversely, the largest median RTT decrease (38%) corresponds to paths from
South America to Angola: 99% of observed paths directly traversed SACS when
routed within AC, enabling packets to travel a great-circle distance of 6,641 km
less than before. This case shows that optimal routing within AC’s network can
indeed substantially improve end-to-end performance for AS paths it serves.
We saw only a third of such improvement from Africa to Brazil (a drop of
73 ms i.e., 21%). Further investigation revealed cases of suboptimal interdomain
routing for paths going notably from Mauritius, Ghana, Tanzania, South Africa,
or Zambia to Brazil via cities on other continents, which result from the persis-
tent lack of peering among neighboring ASes [29,30,32,34].
We then used Fig. 3 and Table 1 to check whether SACS introduced new
backup IP paths between the regions AC connected. No observed  pairs
hinted the existence of paths from South America to Europe/Asia via SACS and
Africa. Instead, paths from North America toward destinations in Africa via SACS
beneﬁt from an RTT decrease of at least 20 ms; SACS could thus play the role of a
valid backup path for North American ASes to reach African countries or could be
used for load balancing purposes. We also checked whether AC received/routed
packets post-SACS through new IXPs. Before the SACS launch, AC was present
at public peering points spanning ﬁve continents [3,4,47]. We observed AC peer-
ing at ﬁve additional IXPs (in UK, US, BR, and RU) post-SACS for the same set
of  pairs, i.e., and expanded interconnection footprint.
