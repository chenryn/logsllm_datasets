## Abstract
Online microblogging services, exemplified by Twitter, have gained immense popularity in recent years. However, these systems often suffer from performance bottlenecks, malicious attacks, and high operational costs due to their centralized architecture. This demonstration introduces Cuckoo, a decentralized and socio-aware microblogging system designed to address these issues. Cuckoo leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques and social relations to provide scalable, reliable, and cost-effective microblogging services. The demo will showcase the benefits of decentralization and socio-awareness in improving the performance and robustness of microblogging systems.

## 1. Introduction
The phenomenal success of Twitter-like services has made microblogging a popular communication tool. Twitter, launched in October 2006, had over 41.7 million users by July 2009, and its user base continues to grow. Unlike traditional weblogging, microblogging relies on an opt-in publish-subscribe (pub-sub) model, where users "follow" others to receive their microblogs. This model automatically delivers updates without requiring users to poll information sources.

Microblogging also offers social networking features, such as maintaining personal profiles, discovering potential acquaintances, and finding interesting topics. Social links in microblogging often reflect real-life relationships. For instance, Twitter users can be classified into different social identities, such as broadcasters (e.g., celebrities and news media) and miscreants (users who try to contact everyone).

Current microblogging systems are centralized, leading to performance bottlenecks, single points of failure, and vulnerability to service blocking and malicious attacks. To address these issues, we propose Cuckoo, a decentralized and socio-aware microblogging system. Cuckoo aims to reduce bandwidth costs, remove single points of failure, and improve robustness while maintaining or even enhancing performance.

## 2. Cuckoo in a Nutshell
### Decentralization
Cuckoo is built on a hybrid overlay structure that combines structured and unstructured P2P overlays. The structured overlay, based on Pastry, organizes user clients for location services and improved availability. The unstructured overlay, based on gossip protocols, disseminates micro-news among users with similar interests. Dedicated servers still hold user profiles and statuses but serve as backup to ensure availability.

### Socio-Awareness
Cuckoo leverages social relations such as friends, neighbors, followers, and followees. Friends help each other to balance load and improve availability. Normal users directly push microblogs to their followers. For high-profile users like broadcasters, gossip-based push between neighbors is used to propagate micro-news.

## 3. Demo Scenarios
### Demo Setup
The demo runs Cuckoo in a site network connected to the Internet using three netbooks, each running several Cuckoo applications. Each application represents a Twitter user. Cuckoo is compatible with most current microblogging systems and does not require any server-side modifications.

### Cuckoo Use Cases
#### Bandwidth and Traffic Saved
Cuckoo's decentralized architecture significantly reduces bandwidth and traffic. A traffic analyzer measures real-time traffic from peers and servers. Most micro-news is fetched via peer collaboration, reducing the need for frequent server requests.

#### Dissemination Effect
Cuckoo's socio-aware dissemination is demonstrated through propagation coverage, showing the percentage of online followers who successfully receive micro-news. The dissemination analyzer illustrates this with a bar chart, highlighting the effectiveness of mutual assistance among neighbors.

## 4. Conclusion
Cuckoo is a decentralized and socio-aware microblogging system designed to be more scalable and reliable than current centralized systems. The demo showcases Cuckoo's design rationale, architecture, and practical benefits, including significant performance gains.
