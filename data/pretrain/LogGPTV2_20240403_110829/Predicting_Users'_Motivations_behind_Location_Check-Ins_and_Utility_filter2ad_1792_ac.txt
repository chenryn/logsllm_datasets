2) Inferred Purpose vs. Utility: In this scenario, the actual
purpose of the check-in is not known. As a consequence, the
purpose vector is not a binary vector anymore but it contains
probabilities, as they are output by the SVM purpose classiﬁer
9
of the previous stage. On the one hand, this provides less
certainty about the actual purpose of the check-in; on the
other hand, it enables a linear combination of purposes to be
expressed in the regression function, instead of a single one.
The regression results for this scenario show that, overall,
the linear model achieves a slightly better ﬁt (R2 = 0.21)
and a slightly lower mean error (1.18), where p < .01. In
terms of coefﬁcients of the purpose parameters, we observe
that they are all positive and larger than 8, as the purpose vector
contains the probability distribution over purposes, and thus
larger coefﬁcients can be used for the regression. The largest
predictor is the same as in the previous case, i.e., “inform
about people around” (value of 32.45, p < .01). Moreover,
the coefﬁcients of the other parameters (obfuscation and user
features) are similar to the previous case as well. The intercept
is negative at −10.8.
Compared to the case where the actual purposes are known,
the inferred purposes achieve overall similar results, although
we observe a slight improvement of 5% in terms of overall
ﬁt of the model for the case where the purpose classiﬁer is
used. This suggests that better results can be achieved for the
linear model, by allowing for a larger ﬂexibility in terms of
purposes. We believe that, in practice, this is to be expected as
users who check into places usually do so for a combination
of purposes, rather than a single one. In our dataset, we also
collected information about an optional secondary purpose, but
we obtained too few entries for such an information.
B. Non-linear Model of Utility vs. Purpose
In order to overcome possible limitations of the linear
model, we compared the previous results with those obtained
by using a non-linear model based on the model tree technique
M5P [34]. This model produces a tree of regression models,
where linear regression functions are found at the nodes of
the tree. We performed the regression over all the check-ins
in WEKA, using 10-fold cross validation.
We ﬁrst consider the case where the actual purposes are
known. The regression produces signiﬁcantly better results in
terms of mean absolute error of prediction, which is 0.66
compared to 1.19 of the linear model (-56%), by taking into
account 362 rules present in the tree. As expected, the non-
linear model performs better than the linear one, as the M5P
model is better able to model the complex subtleties of the
users perceived utility. The correlation coefﬁcient of the overall
model is also relatively high (81%). In particular, we observe
that the users’ age is the ﬁrst attribute that is considered in the
M5P output tree, i.e., the age provides the largest reduction
in the error of the utility regression function: For participants
who are less than 33 years old, the subsequent attribute is the
level of semantic obfuscation; however, for participants that
are older, the subsequent attribute is the frequency of visiting
the second-ancestor of the check-in venue. This ﬁnding shows
how participants that belong to distinct age groups seem to
use different criteria when evaluating the utility of check-
ins after they are obfuscated. As part of future work, we
intend to further study the relationship between motivation-
based features and demographic ones, by means of a semi-
structured interviews in addition to online surveys. For the case
where the purposes are inferred and not known, we observe a
month in the past), or by including additional information to
help participants remember about the context of their check-in
(e.g., attached pictures). Finally, the use of a 5-point scale to
quantify utility (with only the 1 and 5 options annotated) could
lead to different interpretation between participants.
We intend to overcome some of the aforementioned limi-
tations by integrating a larger number of participants through
more diverse advertisement campaigns that,
in addition to
MTurk, include a broader set of people from other countries.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we study the users’ motivations for checking
in on a popular platform (Foursquare), and we design an
automated mechanism to infer and exploit these motivations,
in order to reduce the amount of excessive details that are
released by a check-in. First, we show that the purposes of
check-ins play a signiﬁcant role in determining their utility
for the users, after we remove or replace some details on the
semantic and geographic levels. In particular, we show that
obfuscating (or reducing) information on the semantic level
has a signiﬁcantly more negative effect on the utility of the
check-ins, compared to obfuscating on the geographic level.
By exploiting these insights, we design and evaluate an
it
automated purpose inference mechanism, showing that
achieves a performance that
is two times better than the
baseline. Furthermore, we re-use the output of the inference
mechanism to build and evaluate a regression model for utility,
given the purpose of the check-in and the level of obfuscation.
We show that a non-linear characterization of utility achieves
a small prediction error (0.68 over the range [1, 5]), and we
show that for more than 60% of users’ check-ins, at least
one of the proposed obfuscation methods can be used without
signiﬁcantly damaging their utility. This makes it possible
for application and system developers, using generalization
techniques, to incorporate privacy-preserving tools that have
a negligible effect on the usability of the system, yet provide
a higher level of privacy to the users. For instance, such a tool
could choose the appropriate level of obfuscation (in terms of
utility, based on–among other things–the inferred motivation
behind the check-in) and either directly apply this level of
obfuscation to the shared information or make a suggestion to
the user and let her choose the level of obfuscation she prefers.
Beyond helping model the perceived utility, inferring the
purposes of individual location check-ins can reveal useful
to create new features on LBSNs. For example, users could
be offered the “directions to the venue” feature for check-ins
which purpose is “Wish people to join me” or offered to share
a group picture for check-ins which purpose is “Inform about
people around me”. More generally, the classiﬁcation of the
check-ins (wrt their purposes) could be used to automatically
adjust the way the check-in history is presented to the users.
As part of future work, in addition to overcoming some
of the limitations we discussed, we plan to provide further
insight into behavioral patterns and provide explanations for
the regression models, by collaborating with experts from
social psychology at partner institutions. Moreover, we intend
to study the differences, in terms of check-in behaviors (and
the implications on the perceived utility of check-ins), between
different LBSNs. Finally, we plan to run a trial (based on an
mobile app that allows users to obfuscate their check-ins) in
order to assess the potential of our approach in the wild.
