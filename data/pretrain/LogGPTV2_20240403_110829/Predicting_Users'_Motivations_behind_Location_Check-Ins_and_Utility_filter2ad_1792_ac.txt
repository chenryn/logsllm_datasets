### 2) Inferred Purpose vs. Utility

In this scenario, the actual purpose of the check-in is unknown. Consequently, the purpose vector is no longer binary but contains probabilities, as output by the SVM purpose classifier from the previous stage. This introduces a degree of uncertainty about the actual purpose of the check-in. However, it also allows for a linear combination of purposes to be expressed in the regression function, rather than a single purpose.

The regression results for this scenario show that the linear model achieves a slightly better fit (RÂ² = 0.21) and a slightly lower mean error (1.18), with p < .01. The coefficients of the purpose parameters are all positive and greater than 8, reflecting the probability distribution over purposes. This enables the use of larger coefficients in the regression. The most significant predictor is "inform about people around" (value of 32.45, p < .01). The coefficients of other parameters (obfuscation and user features) are similar to the previous case. The intercept is negative at -10.8.

Compared to the case where the actual purposes are known, the inferred purposes achieve overall similar results, with a slight improvement of 5% in the overall fit of the model when the purpose classifier is used. This suggests that allowing for greater flexibility in terms of purposes can yield better results for the linear model. In practice, users who check into places often do so for multiple reasons, rather than a single one. In our dataset, we collected information on an optional secondary purpose, but there were too few entries to draw meaningful conclusions.

### B. Non-linear Model of Utility vs. Purpose

To address potential limitations of the linear model, we compared the results with those obtained using a non-linear model based on the M5P model tree technique [34]. This model generates a tree of regression models, with linear regression functions at each node. We performed the regression on all check-ins in WEKA using 10-fold cross-validation.

For the case where the actual purposes are known, the non-linear model produced significantly better results in terms of mean absolute error of prediction (0.66 compared to 1.19 for the linear model, a 56% reduction), with 362 rules in the tree. As expected, the non-linear model outperformed the linear one, as M5P is better suited to capturing the complex subtleties of users' perceived utility. The correlation coefficient of the overall model was relatively high (81%). Specifically, the users' age was the first attribute considered in the M5P output tree, providing the largest reduction in the error of the utility regression function. For participants under 33 years old, the subsequent attribute was the level of semantic obfuscation. For older participants, the subsequent attribute was the frequency of visiting the second-ancestor of the check-in venue. This finding indicates that participants in different age groups use different criteria when evaluating the utility of obfuscated check-ins.

As part of future work, we plan to further study the relationship between motivation-based features and demographic ones through semi-structured interviews and online surveys. For the case where purposes are inferred and not known, we observed that...

### VI. Conclusion

In this paper, we examined users' motivations for checking in on Foursquare and designed an automated mechanism to infer and exploit these motivations to reduce the amount of excessive details released by a check-in. We demonstrated that the purposes of check-ins play a significant role in determining their utility after removing or replacing some details on the semantic and geographic levels. Specifically, we found that obfuscating information on the semantic level has a more negative effect on the utility of check-ins compared to obfuscating on the geographic level.

By leveraging these insights, we designed and evaluated an automated purpose inference mechanism, achieving performance twice as good as the baseline. We then used the output of the inference mechanism to build and evaluate a regression model for utility, given the purpose of the check-in and the level of obfuscation. The non-linear characterization of utility achieved a small prediction error (0.68 over the range [1, 5]), and for more than 60% of users' check-ins, at least one of the proposed obfuscation methods could be used without significantly damaging their utility. This makes it possible for application and system developers to incorporate privacy-preserving tools that have a negligible effect on usability while providing a higher level of privacy to users.

Beyond modeling perceived utility, inferring the purposes of individual location check-ins can reveal useful insights for creating new features on LBSNs. For example, users could be offered the "directions to the venue" feature for check-ins with the purpose of "Wish people to join me" or the option to share a group picture for check-ins with the purpose of "Inform about people around me." More generally, the classification of check-ins (based on their purposes) could be used to automatically adjust how the check-in history is presented to users.

As part of future work, we plan to address some of the limitations discussed, provide further insight into behavioral patterns, and offer explanations for the regression models by collaborating with social psychology experts at partner institutions. Additionally, we intend to study the differences in check-in behaviors and their implications on the perceived utility of check-ins across different LBSNs. Finally, we plan to run a trial using a mobile app that allows users to obfuscate their check-ins to assess the potential of our approach in real-world settings.
