### RMSE and Linearity of Trajectories

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is inversely proportional to the linearity of a trajectory from the perspective of Vx. Figure 14 illustrates the relationship between the verification results of 1,000 flights and their linearity. For honest trajectories, the verification result remains consistently low, whereas for dishonest trajectories, the results increase with non-linearity, as indicated by a higher RMSE.

We also investigated the minimum RMSE required to achieve zero false acceptance and rejection rates in the local verification scheme. The findings are presented in Figure 15. It can be concluded that the required linearity decreases as the number of position reports used to calculate Vx increases.

### Challenges with Linear Tracks and Clock Drift

This section highlights the challenges associated with linear tracks in the presence of clock drift. Such scenarios may pose significant problems, particularly where rapid detection rates are necessary. For example, the minimum number of location claims needed increases when dealing with linear tracks, which is undesirable in contexts requiring fast detection. To address this issue, several approaches to mitigate linearity are discussed in the following section.

### Linearity Mitigation Approaches

#### Placement of Verifiers
Long reception ranges can lead to high dilution of precision (DOP) for tracks far from the verifiers. DOP causes distances between locations to appear shorter, reducing the tolerance for non-linearity. To tackle this, we recommend a linearity-aware placement of verifiers within the area of interest. Evenly distributing verifiers across the area reduces the DOP, thereby increasing the tolerance for non-linear tracks. In cases where only specific tracks are possible (e.g., on roads or rails), a strategic placement of verifiers can completely prevent linear tracks.

#### Bounding Clock Drift
Another approach is to reduce the minimum required RMSE by bounding the estimated clock drift. If the upper bound of clock drifts is known and the estimated clock drift exceeds this bound, the track claim may be considered dishonest. This method is effective if the clock drift bound is lower than the linear deviation caused by the adversary's dishonesty.

#### Collaborative Estimation of Clock Drift
A collaborative scheme for estimating clock drift can also prevent attacks exploiting linearity. By determining the clock drift coefficients relative to other verifiers, a global clock drift estimate can be agreed upon, making it impossible to hide linear dishonesty through different clock drift estimations. Trusted provers can be used to exchange clock drift estimators after a sufficiently non-linear track has been accepted, thus learning the clock drift coefficients for other verifiers.

#### RMSE Calculation
In cases where the above approaches are not feasible, verifiers must calculate the RMSE as part of the verification process. Each verifier can then determine whether it is capable of verifying a track. Tracks that are too linear for verification should be rejected to prevent the system from being vulnerable to attacks.

### Discussion and Future Work

The strength of our track verification scheme lies in its simplicity. Any node that knows its own position and can capture the timestamps of received claims can calculate Vx. Additionally, the scheme operates passively, requiring no additional communication between verifiers and provers beyond the track claims. This makes verifiers simple devices that can be easily integrated into existing systems and run in parallel without disrupting them.

#### Mobile Adversary
In Section III-A, we demonstrated that our scheme is secure against stationary adversaries by assuming a fixed propagation delay Δx. If this assumption is removed, the scheme may not be secure. A mobile adversary must move in such a way that the propagation delays from the attacker's positions to all verifiers change exactly as they would on the claimed track. In scenarios where the adversary cannot move freely (e.g., due to obstacles in a city), a mobile adversary may not be able to claim arbitrary tracks. However, in other scenarios, such as a vehicular ad hoc network, an adversary using a helicopter or drone could claim dishonest tracks. From a practical standpoint, such an attack would still be difficult to execute, as it would likely violate the reception area sanity check described in Section V.

#### Adversary’s Knowledge
Another parameter of the threat model is the adversary's knowledge. In our security analysis, we assumed the attacker knows everything, including its position and the positions of all verifiers. This knowledge makes the verification insecure when |V| < 3. Capkun et al. proposed a scheme for secure location verification using covert base stations (CBS) whose locations are unknown to the attacker at the time of execution. This idea can be applied to our scheme, making it more secure by increasing the difficulty for the adversary to bypass the reception area sanity check and reducing the number of verifiers required for secure verification.

#### Limits of Our Scheme
Like other location verification schemes based on signal arrival measurements, our scheme is not secure if an adversary can transmit independent signals to all verifiers. Such attacks require extremely accurate timing and knowledge of the exact positions and reception ranges of all verifiers, making them highly sophisticated and difficult to execute.

### Related Work

This section provides a brief overview of related work. A more comprehensive review of secure localization and location verification is available in [20].

1. **Distance Bounding Protocols**: These protocols use cryptographic techniques to establish an upper bound on the physical distance to a prover. They are active and require specialized hardware, unlike our passive approach.
2. **Multilateration**: This passive localization technique uses the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of signals at geographically distributed stations. It requires precise time synchronization, making it expensive and suitable only for smaller deployments. Our scheme does not require time synchronization, significantly reducing infrastructure costs.
3. **Angle-of-Arrival**: Systems using directional antennas can prevent attacks and localize emitters. However, these systems are costly and susceptible to multi-path reflections and side-lobes.
4. **Kalman Filters**: Kalman filters can be used to verify the integrity of tracks from ADS-B data but assume errors are mainly due to non-malicious factors. They are not secure against malicious injection of spoofed position claims.

### Conclusion

In this work, we presented a mechanism for securely verifying tracks of mobile nodes such as cars or aircraft. Our scheme leverages the prover's mobility to avoid the need for synchronization and additional communication. We have proven that three verifiers using our scheme can securely detect stationary attackers. Extensive simulations were conducted to analyze performance under realistic conditions, and requirements for a secure implementation were derived. The applicability of our scheme to air traffic monitoring was demonstrated using real traffic data.
