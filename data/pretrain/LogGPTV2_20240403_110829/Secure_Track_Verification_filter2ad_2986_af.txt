the RMSE, the less linear the trajectory from the viewpoint of
Vx. Figure 14 shows the dependency of the veriﬁcation results
of 1000 ﬂights on the linearity. While the veriﬁcation result
stays constantly small for honest trajectory claims, the results
for dishonest trajectories increases along with the non-linearity
(i.e. with the RMSE).
We also considered the least required RMSE to achieve a
zero false acceptance and rejection rate for the local veriﬁ-
cation scheme. The results are shown in Figure 15. We can
conclude that the least required linearity becomes smaller the
more position reports we used to calculate V x
T .
it
As this section showed,
is challenging to deal with
linear tracks in combination with clock drift. This might
pose a problem for some scenarios. For instance, the least
number of required location claims increases if linear tracks
are considered. This is disadvantageous for scenarios where
fast detection rates are desired. To mitigate this problem, we
discuss several approaches to avoid or deal with linearity in
the next section.
C. Linearity Mitigation Approaches
Long reception ranges result in a high dilution of precision
(DOP) for tracks far away from the veriﬁers. Due to DOP,
distances between locations further away appear shorter which
leaves less room for non-linearity. To tackle this problem, we
recommend a linearity-aware placement of veriﬁers in the area
of interest. For instance, distributing the available veriﬁers
evenly across the area reduces the distances between tracks
and veriﬁers and thus the DOP. In cases where only certain
tracks are possible (e.g. provers are moving on roads or rails),
a linearity-aware placement of veriﬁers can even prevent linear
tracks completely.
Another way to deal with linearity is to reduce the least
required RMSE by bounding the estimated clock drift. If the
upper bound of clock drifts is known and ˆtx
drift exceeds it,
211211
the track claim might be dishonest. This approach is only
applicable, if the clock drift bound is lower than the linear
deviation caused by the dishonesty of the adversary.
Lastly, a collaborative scheme for estimating ˆtx
drift can
also prevent attacks which exploit linearity. Therefore, the
clock drift coefﬁcients relative to some (or all) of the other
veriﬁers must be determined. This knowledge can then be
used to agree on a global ˆtx
drift, making it impossible to
hide linear dishonesty in different clock drift estimations.
The pairwise clock drift coefﬁcients can be determined using
trusted provers. After a track with a sufﬁciently high non-
linearity has been accepted by the system, they exchange
their clock drift estimators and, by that, learn the clock drift
coefﬁcients for the other veriﬁers.
For cases in which none of the above approaches is feasible,
veriﬁers must calculate the RMSE as part of the veriﬁcation
process. Each veriﬁer can then assess whether it is in the posi-
tion to verify a track or not. Tracks too linear for veriﬁcation
should be rejected a priori in order to avoid laying the system
open to attacks.
VIII. DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK
The strength of our track veriﬁcation scheme lies within its
simplicity. Any node which knows its own position and is able
to capture the timestamps of the received claims can calculate
V x
T . Besides that, the scheme works completely passive. Ex-
cept the track claims, there is no additional communication
between veriﬁers and provers necessary. Hence, veriﬁers are
simple devices which can be integrated into existing systems
easily. Furthermore, they can run in parallel to systems which
need to be secured without touching them.
This simplicity of our scheme enables many applications.
In some of them, different threat models might be interesting.
Therefore, we discuss several adjustments of our threat model.
A deeper analysis will be subject to future work.
A. Mobile Adversary
In section III-A, we have proven that our scheme is secure
for stationary adversaries by assuming a ﬁxed propagation
delay Δx
A. If we remove this assumption, the scheme might
not be secure anymore. However, the adversary must be able
to move in a way such that the propagation delays from the
attackers positions to all veriﬁers change exactly as they would
change on the claimed track. In scenarios where the adversary
cannot move freely (e.g. due to obstacles in a city), a mobile
adversary might not be able to claim arbitrary tracks. Yet,
this might be a valid threat in other scenarios. For instance,
if the attacker has more degrees of freedom than legitimate
nodes, it might be able to successfully claim dishonest tracks.
An example would be a vehicular ad hoc network and an
adversary that uses a helicopter or drone to claim dishonest
tracks. From a practical point of view, such an attack would
still be hard to realize since such an adversary will most likely
violate the reception area sanity check described in section V.
investigate the requirements
for successful GPS spooﬁng attacks. They derive placement

constraints for a mobile attacker which tries to spoof the
GPS-derived location of several receivers. One of their results
is that the attacker’s transmission locations must lie on a
hyperboloid to spoof two receivers and on a hyperbola for
three receivers. In GPS, receivers use the TDoA of satellite
signals to calculate their locations. Since our scheme also
relies on ToA measurements, a mobile attacker would face
similar placement constraints in our scheme. In fact, pre-
liminary research on placement constraints suggests that the
additional degree of freedom of the mobile attacker can be
compensated by requiring an additional veriﬁer.
B. Adversary’s Knowledge
Another parameter of the threat model is the adversary’s
knowledge. In our security analysis, we assumed that the
attacker knows everything. In particular, it is aware of its
position and the positions of all veriﬁers. This knowledge
makes the veriﬁcation with |V | < 3 insecure.
ˇCapkun et al. proposed a scheme for secure location veriﬁ-
cation whose security is based on covert base stations (CBS)
[13]. By CBS, the authors mean veriﬁers whose locations are
not known to the attacker at the time of execution of the secure
location veriﬁcation. A potential attacker would have to guess
the CBSs positions right in order to time the transmissions of
its claims without causing inconsistencies at the veriﬁers.
This idea is also applicable to our scheme. It would beneﬁt
from CBSs in two ways. First, bypassing the reception area
sanity check is much harder if the adversary does not know
where its signal is expected. It could guess the area based
on signal propagation models, but the effort would be much
higher and the chance to be detected much larger. Second, the
number of veriﬁers required to securely verify tracks can be
reduced. In theory, just a single veriﬁer would be sufﬁcient as
long as it is covered. If the attacker is not able to estimate the
propagation delay Δx
A of its signal to veriﬁer Vx, it can only
guess ΔA and would be detected with a high probability (see
Figure 3).
Similar to CBSs, mobile veriﬁers would increase the detec-
tion probability of dishonest tracks signiﬁcantly. The adversary
must keep track of all veriﬁers to launch timing attacks and
bypass the reception area sanity check. Mobile veriﬁers are
indeed a realistic scenario. In air trafﬁc monitoring, honest
airplanes could also act as veriﬁers. Airplanes equipped with
ADS-B receivers and GPS meet all requirements for calcu-
lating V x
T for surrounding airplanes. If dishonest tracks are
detected, the pilot could warn the ground stations, e.g., using
voice communication. Another advantage of using airplanes
as veriﬁers is that at high altitudes, airplanes can have ranges
of more than thousand kilometers4. Together with the high
density of today’s air spaces, a world-wide coverage could
be easily achieved without the need of new infrastructure. In
OpenSky, a single sensor receives position reports of up to 60
airplanes at the same time during peak trafﬁc hours. Thus, high
4assuming that communication is possible if there is a line-of-sight con-
nection
numbers of veriﬁers |V | could be achieved by using trusted
airplanes for veriﬁcation.
C. Limits Of Our Scheme
As all location veriﬁcation schemes which rely on signal
arrival measurements, our scheme is not secure if an adversary
is able to transmit independent signals to all veriﬁers. The
attacker could use directional antennas or launch a coordinated
attack from different positions. In that way, it can time the
signal arrivals at the veriﬁers exactly as if they were sent
from the claimed positions. However, such attacks are very
sophisticated since they require an extremely accurate timing.
In addition to that, the attacker still has to know the exact
positions and reception ranges of all veriﬁers.
IX. RELATED WORK
This section gives a brief overview of work that is related
to ours. A more general overview of secure localization and
secure location veriﬁcation is available in [20].
1) Distance bounding protocols: Distance bounding pro-
tocols are two-way ranging protocols that rely on crypto-
graphic techniques to enable a veriﬁer to establish an upper
bound on the physical distance to a prover. These protocols
are based on timing the delay between sending out chal-
lenge bits and receiving back the corresponding response
bits. The idea was ﬁrst proposed by Brands and Chaum in
1994 [21]. Sastry et al. then proposed using it for secure
location veriﬁcation in 2003 [6]. Later, more general concepts
for using distance bounding for secure location veriﬁcation
were proposed among others by Singelee and Preneel [7]
and ˇCapkun and Hubaux [9]. Distance bounding protocols,
however, are active and require highly specialized hardware to
keep the processing time constant and as short as possible [8].
In contrast, our approach is passive and does not require any
specialized hardware or protocol.
2) Multilateration: Mutlilateration is a passive localiza-
tion technique based on the time difference of arrival (TDoA)
of signals at geographically distributed stations. Multilat-
eration is often used in radar systems for localization of
mobile targets [22] and has also been proposed for location
veriﬁcation [5], [12]. The major drawback of multilateration
is that it requires very precise time synchronization on the
order of nanoseconds at the veriﬁers. This requirement makes
the technique quite expensive and affordable only for smaller
deployments. Conversely, secure track veriﬁcation as we pro-
pose in this work does not require time synchronization which
dramatically reduces the costs of infrastructure.
The authors of [16] have used mobility-differentiated ToA
as a special form of TDoA for location surveying in sensor net-
works. However, the algorithms proposed in their work assume
non-adversarial settings whereas our approach is designed to
be secure against location spooﬁng attacks.
3) Angle-of-arrival: The location of wireless transmitters
can be estimated by using the angle-of-arrival of the incoming
signals. Systems have been proposed that rely on directional
antennas [10], [11] to prevent attacks and to localize emitters.

However, directional antennas with a high degree of direc-
tionality are costly and several antennas are required at each
veriﬁer in order to capture attacks from all possible directions.
In addition, angle-of-arrival methods are highly susceptible
to multi-path reﬂections of the signal [23] and directional
antennas typically exhibit side-lobes which can be exploited
by the attacker to fool the system in real-world scenarios.
4) Kalman Filters: Kalman ﬁlters are algorithms that use
a series of measurements observed over time to ﬁlter out noisy
input data and produce more accurate estimations of the output
state. Kalman ﬁlters have been proposed as a way to verify
the integrity of the tracks received from ADS-B data [24].
However as pointed out by [25], [26], Kalman ﬁlters assume
that the errors in the location claims are mainly because of
non-malicious factors such as mobility or channel interference.
Kalman ﬁlters are not secure against malicious injection of
spoofed position claims.
X. CONCLUCION
In this work, we presented a mechanism for securely verify-
ing tracks on which mobile nodes such as cars or aircraft claim
to move on. Our scheme exploits the prover’s mobility to avoid
the need for synchronization and additional communication.
Besides that,
it does not assume any restrictions on the
attacker’s knowledge. We have proven that three veriﬁers using
our scheme are able to securely detect stationary attackers.
Furthermore, we have conducted extensive simulations to ana-
lyze the performance of our scheme under realistic conditions.
We analyzed many different aspects such as error propagation,
system requirements, and practicality. In particular, we used
real trafﬁc data to demonstrate its applicability to air trafﬁc
monitoring. Based on insights from our simulations, we de-
rived requirements for a secure implementation of our scheme
and discussed different threat models.
