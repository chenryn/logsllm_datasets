## Abstract
Existing secret key generation schemes for body-worn devices using wireless channel characteristics, such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI), rely on node mobility and often suffer from low bit rates. In this work, we propose a novel RSSI-based secret key generation protocol, iARC, which is independent of mobility and induces artificial randomness in the channel through the use of dual antennas and dynamic frequency hopping.

## 1. Introduction

Previous schemes, such as ASK-BAN [2], which depend on body motion, are not suitable for many real-time applications. In contrast, SeAK [1], designed for initial trust establishment between a new device and an existing Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN), can be used for periodic key renewal even when the person is stationary. Our proposed protocol, iARC, leverages dual antennas and dynamic frequency hopping to generate secret keys, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.

### 1.1 Inducing Artificial Channel Randomness

We assume a system with one Control Unit (CU) that aggregates sensor data and one or more wearable sensor devices (D). The CU is equipped with two antennas, A1 and A2, which have different characteristics and are placed close to each other. The CU uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate a random bit string \( r \in \{0, 1\}^{128} \), which is used for antenna selection. iARC employs frequency diversity and random antenna switching to induce artificial randomness in the channel.

### 1.2 Secret Key Generation

The secret key generation process in iARC consists of the following steps:

1. **Channel Sampling:** The CU and D exchange packets on a particular channel and record the RSSI values.
2. **Quantization and Multiple Bit Assignment:** Each RSSI sample is assigned an n-bit code word.
3. **Dynamic Frequency Hopping:** The CU and D decide on a dynamic channel hopping pattern based on the lowest level of RSSI. They repeat the channel sampling, quantization, and frequency hopping until the required number of probes \( N \) for key generation is exchanged.

The total number of probes \( N \) is divided into \( B \) sub-blocks of equal length. Each sub-block key \( k_{sb} \) is derived in a different channel, and the final secret key \( K \) is obtained by concatenating all the sub-block keys:
\[ K = k_{sb1} \parallel k_{sb2} \parallel \cdots \parallel k_{sbB} \]

## 2. Results

iARC achieves a bit rate of 800 bps with 100% bit agreement between the two legitimate body-worn devices, generating a 128-bit key in 160 ms. The keys generated by iARC pass the NIST test with entropy ranging from 0.92 to 0.99.
