ABSTRACT
The existing secret key generation schemes for body-worn
devices using wireless channel characteristics, e.g., received
signal strength indicator (RSSI) are dependent on the node
mobility and have very low bit rate. In this work, we propose
a novel mobility independent RSSI based secret key gener-
ation protocol – iARC, which induces artiﬁcial randomness
in the channel by employing dual antennas and dynamic
frequency hopping eﬀectively.

SeAK [1] proposed for initial trust establishment between
a new device and an existing Wireless Body Area Network
(WBAN), iARC can be employed by the body-worn devices
for periodic key renewal even when the person is not in mo-
tion. We have validated our system using Opal and Iris
motes operating in 2.4 GHz, and used TinyOS to program
the devices. We have conducted extensive set of experiments
to validate our protocol in diﬀerent real-time environments.

Inducing artiﬁcial channel randomness
We assume that there is one Control Unit (CU) which acts
as an aggregator for the sensor data, and one or more wear-
able sensor devices (D). The CU uses two antennas A1 and

A2 having diﬀerent features which are placed very close to
each other. The CU employs a pseudo-random number gen-
erator (PRNG) to generate a random bit string r P t0, 1u128
which is used for antenna selection. iARC employs frequency
diversity along with random antenna switching to induce ar-
tiﬁcial channel randomness.
1.2 Secret key generation
The secret key generation process consists of the following
steps: (1) Channel sampling, (2) Quantization and multi-
ple bit assignment, and (3) Dynamic frequency hopping. In
iARC, the total number of probes N required for key genera-
tion is divided into B number of multiple sub blocks of equal
length and each sub block key ksb is derived in a diﬀerent
channel. The ﬁnal secret key K is obtained by the concate-
nation of all the sub block keys as shown by the following
equation: K “ ksb1 (cid:107) ksb2 (cid:107) ¨¨¨ (cid:107) ksbB.
Channel sampling is the phase in which the CU and D
exchange packets on a particular channel and record RSSI.
Quantization is the process in which each RSSI sample is
assigned an n bit code word. The CU and D decide Dy-
namic channel hopping pattern based on the lowest level of
RSSI. The CU and D perform channel sampling, quantiza-
tion and frequency hopping repeatedly until the total num-
ber of probes N required for key generation are exchanged.
2. RESULTS
iARC achieves bit rate of 800 bps with 100% bit agree-
ment between the two legitimate body-worn devices, and
generates a 128 bit key in 160 ms. The keys generated by
iARC pass the NIST test with entropy ranging from 0.92 to
0.99.
