User: Our system needs to support multiple languages (such as Chinese, English, French, etc.), please provide an internationalization solution to support users of different language versions.
Assistant: The internationalization solution is mainly divided into the following steps: 1. Text extraction: Extract all texts that need to be translated, including page text, button text, menu text, prompt text, etc. 2. Translation: translate the extracted text, and save the translated text of each language in a file, for example, Chinese is saved in the zh_CN.properties file, and English is saved in the en_US.properties file. 3. Internationalized coding: Add internationalized coding to the page so that the system can automatically display the corresponding translated text according to the user's language environment. You can use Spring's internationalization support, or use front-end methods such as JavaScript. 4. Language switching: Allow users to switch between different language versions through the user's personal settings or page switching buttons. 5. System prompt: The system needs to be able to display corresponding prompt information according to the user's language environment, such as error prompts, warning prompts, etc. 6. Testing and maintenance: After completing the above steps, multilingual testing is required to ensure that the system can work normally in various language environments. At the same time, after the system is upgraded and new functions are added, the translated text and related internationalization codes need to be updated in time.
