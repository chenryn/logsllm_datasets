This is a hacker convention.
Use your head.

Personal Space
PICTURES
Be Polite – Ask first
Still, expect to be in a picture or two.
Ask nicely if you don’t want to be in one.
NOT EVERYTHING IS FREE
Just because you see it laying

SWAG & VENDORS
DEF CON is unique in that:
Swag is DEF CON branded stuff.
Vendors is a vendor hall.  Each vendor has 
something to contribute to the hacker 
community.
Do you feel like a phony? It’s okay, 
just about everyone else does too. 
Remember, if you are hanging 
with a group of people and you 
feel like a fraud because they are 
all super smart, keep in mind they 
chose to have you as a friend.
DOUBLE DOG DARE
Reach out.
Put yourself out there.
Find someone with something you 
share.
TRIPLE DOG DARE
Do something you have never done 
before.
Try one of the villages.
Go to a party.
