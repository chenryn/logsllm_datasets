Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-say-hello-to-html-
elements has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include links
to screen shots if possible.
I noticed that when I scroll the instructions on the left pane, the code
editor scrolls too, making me scroll back to the top when I want to type code.
It wouldn't have been an issue if I had only a few Waypoints but with over
1000 hours of coding, it should be fixed please.
Here is a screenshot of the editor when the instruction is scrolled down:
