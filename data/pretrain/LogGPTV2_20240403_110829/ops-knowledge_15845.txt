User: I stupidly downloaded python 3.2.2 and since then writing 'python' in the terminal yields 'command not found'. Also, when starting the terminal I get this:

-bash: export: `folder]:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/git/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/Applications/android-sdk-mac_86/tools:/Applications/android-sdk-mac_86/platform-tools:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/ant/bin': not a valid identifier
Why the Android SDK folder is there is beyond me. It's all jazzed up. Any ideas how can I remove the offending file, folder or fix his problem? I've checked the System Profiler and python 2.6.1 and 2.7.2.5 shows up.
Assistant: Something got messed up in your $PATH.  Have a look in ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, etc., and look for a line starting with export that doesn't end cleanly.
