On my Nexus 5. Open the gallery, and then go into the app two levels deep.
Then, hit the Android back button enough times to get back to the OS's main
launch screen. Then, bring up the app switcher and select the Gallery app from
the list of backgrounded apps. Tap the gallery app.
Expected: quick resume of the gallery app
Actual: black screen for a few seconds. Almost feels like a resume is slower
than a cold start.
