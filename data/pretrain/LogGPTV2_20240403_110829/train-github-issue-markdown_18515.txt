Hello,

I am currently working on a select box that needs to include the following options, with "Audi" and "Ford" sharing the same label:

- Volvo
- Saab
- Opel
- Audi
- Ford (labeled as "Audi")

When I attempt to render this in Symfony 2.7, my `FormType` is configured as follows:

```php
$builder->add('brand', 'choice', array(
    'choices' => array(
        'volvo' => 'Volvo',
        'saab' => 'Saab',
        'opel' => 'Opel',
        'audi' => 'Audi',
        'ford' => 'Audi'
    )
));
```

I expected all five options to be rendered, but only four are actually displayed:

- Volvo
- Saab
- Opel
- Audi

It appears that the option with the value "ford" is being overridden by the one with the value "audi". I am unsure if this is the expected behavior or a bug, but it is causing some frustration. Could someone provide assistance or insight into this issue?

Thank you in advance!

Best regards,
