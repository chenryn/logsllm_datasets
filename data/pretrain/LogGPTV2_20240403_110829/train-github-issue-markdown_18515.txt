Hi
I have a select box that has to contain the following options. Mention the
same label for the options "audi" and "ford".
      Volvo
      Saab
      Opel
      Audi
      Audi
When I try to render this in Symfony 2.7, my FormType looks like this.
    $builder->add('brand', 'choice', array(
        'choices' => array(
            'volvo' => 'Volvo',
            'saab' => 'Saab',
            'opel' => 'Opel',
            'audi' => 'Audi',
            'ford' => 'Audi'
        )
    ));
I would assume all 5 fields are going to get rendered. In fact, only 4 get
rendered and the view looks like this:
       Volvo
       Saab
       Opel
       Audi
It seems the option with value "audi" is overriden by the option with value
"ford". I don't know if this is standard behaviour or a bug, but it's quite
annoying. Can any of you help me?
Thanks in advance!
