## üìù Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. Install PowerToys
  2. Open Settings, relaunch as administrator with button
  3. Open Settings, navigate to Shortcut Guide
  4. Radio selection UI has background set to "light", but the actual overlay used is dark background until I change the selection to dark and back to light. (note: PC Setting/app mode remained on dark mode the entire time).
### ‚ùå Actual result
_What is the actual result of the above steps?_
Changing setting to dark and opening the guide again: no change (as expected,
the background remained dark)  
Changing setting to light and opening the guide again: now it is light.
