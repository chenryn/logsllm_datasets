As far as I can tell, when `&str` appears as the return type of a function,
this silently implies `&'static str`. I think this holds for all other types
as well, not just `str`. I propose that we force people to be explicit here,
since our general rule is that any borrowed pointer that is returned from a
function must have an explicit lifetime.
