User: How to design a secure network topology to protect sensitive data and applications in the corporate network? Please provide a suitable network security solution.
Assistant: To design a secure network topology to protect sensitive data and applications on an enterprise network, the following aspects can be considered: 1. Hierarchical network design: Divide the network into different subnetworks, each with different Security policies and access control rules to achieve access control and security isolation. 2. Strengthen border security: install firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti-virus software and other security devices at the border of the network to protect the network from external attacks. 3. Encrypted communication: Use encryption protocols such as VPN or SSL to ensure the security of sensitive data during transmission. 4. Authentication and access control: Use measures such as strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to restrict access, and set access control to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and applications. 5. Monitoring and auditing: Deploy a security monitoring system and a log auditing system to monitor all activities in the network in real time, and detect and handle security incidents in a timely manner. Combining the above measures can effectively protect sensitive data and applications in the enterprise network. At the same time, it needs to be customized according to the specific situation to meet the security needs of different enterprises.
