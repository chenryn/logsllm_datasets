I was using Twitter Bootstrap on a recent project and had a page with a body
class of "page_spanish". After a ton of troublshooting, I determined that a
bootstrap selector was picking up the "span" inside of the class and it was
messing up the layout of the page.
Can the selector for this be made more narrow so it won't pick up class names
that contain "span" somewhere in them?
