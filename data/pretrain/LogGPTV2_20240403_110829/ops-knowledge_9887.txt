User: I am developing using PyDev in Eclipse. I have put in some comments in my code. I get wavy red lines underneath certain words. The program runs fine and there are no warnings mentioned. So what is the meaning of these wavy lines.
e.g.

#!/usr/bin/python - I get the line under usr and python

# generated by accessing registry using another script written in VBScript.
# The scripts can do the follwing things.

- I get wavy lines under the words registry and following.

I need these comments as I may run the module on its own later. 
Thanks for the help.
Assistant: Might be this is just a spellchecker. You have a typo "follwing" instead of "following".
