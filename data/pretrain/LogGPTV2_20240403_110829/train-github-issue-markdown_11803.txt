**Current Behavior**
In Angular 2 RC2, routing in Internet Explorer 11 throws an exception when the back button is used more than once. Additionally, component lifecycle hooks are not being called correctly. This issue is a duplicate of #7722.

**Expected Behavior**
- The application should not throw an exception.
- Component lifecycle hooks should be called correctly.

**Steps to Reproduce the Problem**
1. Open the Plunker provided in the official Angular documentation:
   - [Angular Router Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html)
   - [Plunker Example](http://plnkr.co/edit/h0o2IuoZYvXGtC1ejQBl?p=preview)
2. Perform some navigation within the application.
3. Open the Developer Console (press F12).
4. Use the browser's back button multiple times.

**Error Output**
