User: How to configure DNS server? How to implement internal DNS resolution and external DNS resolution?
Assistant: 1. First, choose the appropriate DNS server software. Commonly used DNS servers include BIND, NSD, Unbound, etc. 2. Create zones on the DNS server, including internal and external zones. The internal zone refers to the corresponding relationship between the host name and the IP address of the internal network managed by the DNS server, while the external zone refers to the corresponding relationship between the external domain names that the DNS server can resolve. 3. For internal DNS resolution, it is necessary to add a record (A record) corresponding to the host name and IP address in the internal zone file. At the same time, a reverse resolution record (PTR record) needs to be added so that the DNS server can resolve the IP address into a host name. 4. For external DNS resolution, it is necessary to configure domain name resolution records (A record, CNAME record, etc.) in the external zone file, and use the forwarding function of the DNS server to forward unresolvable domain name requests to the public DNS server for processing. The forwarding function needs to be set in the configuration file of the DNS server. 5. Finally, the DNS of the internal host needs to be set to the IP address of the DNS server, so that the internal host can perform domain name resolution through the DNS server. In short, to realize the internal resolution and external resolution of the DNS server, it is necessary to configure the DNS server and add corresponding domain name resolution records in the internal zone and external zone files. At the same time, a forwarding function needs to be set so that the DNS server can forward unresolvable domain name requests to the public DNS server for processing.
