In the following proposition, we derive the probability
of D successfully pairing with a rogue BS, when the ON
slots of the helper are inferred with probability p(cid:48)
I. Note
that in general p(cid:48)
I is different than the pI of Proposition
1. The inference of the helper’s ON slots in Proposition
1 must occur based on very few samples because the ad-
versary must quickly decide whether to perform signal
cancellation. In the rogue BS case, the adversary can an-
alyze [h(mD),mD] + mH based on all the samples, so it is
expected that p(cid:48)

E[P4].2 Let also E[P(ti)] denote the average power mea-
sured over slot ti using the ﬁrst few samples. The ad-
versary classiﬁes ti to one of four cases by mapping
E[P(ti)] to the closest threshold. That is, case P1 is
inferred if E[P(ti)] > E[P1]+E[P2]
, case P2 is inferred if
≤ E[P(ti)] < E[P2]+E[P3]
E[P1]+E[P2]
, etc. A wrong infer-
ence is made when E[P(ti)] that belongs to case Pi is
mapped to a case Pj with Pi (cid:54)= Pj. In Proposition 1, we
have assumed that the probability pI for correctly infer-
ring cases P1 and P4 is equal to one. In P1, the RSS is
expected to be relatively high due to the co-transmission
from D and H.
In P4, the RSS is expected to be low
because neither D nor H are transmitting. However, the
thresholds for cases P2 and P3 are expected to be very
close, thus leading to frequent wrong inferences. We ex-
perimentally verify this claim.
Experimental Evaluation of pI: Experimental setup:
To evaluate pI, we setup three NI-USRP 2921 devices in
an indoor laboratory environment. Two USRP devices
represented D and H, whereas a third USRP device is
placed at 24 feet away acting as an adversary. The trans-
mit power for an ON slot was set to 20dBm for both D
and H with a symbol duration of 1ms. The devices were
set to work at 2.4GHz and were synchronized. The sam-
pling frequency was set to 2MHz. We tested two scenar-
ios: (1) H is stacked on top of D, and (2) H is moved
away from the legitimate device. The experiment setup
is shown in Figure 8(a).
We implemented amplitude shift keying (ASK) to
transmit MC ON-OFF coded messages and repeatedly
transmitted message {1,0,1,0} from D and message
{1,1,0,0} from H simultaneously. The signals from H
are MC-coded only when the bit value is one. The su-
perposition of the two signals implemented all four cases
P1-P4.
Results: Let PDH denote the probability of detecting that
D and H transmit simultaneously, PNDH denote the prob-
2E[P2] and E[P3] can be similar but not exactly the same, so we can
assume some ordering to make a classiﬁcation rule.

ability of detecting that neither D nor H transmit, and
PH denote the probability of detecting that H is transmit-
ting alone. These correspond to pI for any of the candi-
date scenarios. In the ﬁrst experiment, we measured the
detection probability as a function of the sampling win-
dow size used for computing the average RSS value for a
given slot. Intuitively, a longer sampling window would
lead to better inference but will delay the cancellation op-
eration. Figure 8(b) shows the resulting detection proba-
bilities as a function of the sample window. We observe
that the detection probabilities PDH and PNDH are rela-
tively low and are further reduced with the increase of
the sample window. However, the detection probability
PH is close to 0.5 irrespective of the sample window size.
This indicates that differentiating between the ON slots
of the helper and of the legitimate device, when only one
of the two transmits, is practically equivalent to a ran-
dom guess. Our results justify the selection of pI = 1
when the H and D are simultaneously absent or present,
and pI = 0.5 otherwise.
In the second experiment, we repeated the ﬁrst experi-
ments but conﬁgured H and D to vary their transmission
power on a per-slot basis. The power was varied to re-
duce the inference capability of A. Speciﬁcally, H and
D oscillated their power at random between 10dBm and
20dBm. Figure 8(c) shows the detection probabilities as
a function of the window of samples used for inference.
Effect of proximity on pI: We further performed ex-
periments to evaluate the effect of the proximity between
D and H on their distinguishability. We repeated the ﬁrst
experiment and varied the distance between H and D.
In the ﬁrst part of the experiment, H was moved away
from D while keeping the D-A and H-A distances sim-
ilar (the helper’s motion was perpendicular to the D-A
line. Figure 8(d) shows that the detection probability for
each case is similar to the case where H is stacked on
top of D. In the second part of the experiment, H was
moved towards A, and therefore, the distance between H
and A was gradually reduced. Figure 9(a) shows the re-
spective detection probabilities. As expected, decreasing
the distance between A and H improves the adversary’s
inference capability, but the inference remains imperfect

D and H when H is moved towards A, and (b) detection probability as

when D and H remain relatively close.
In the fourth experiment, we repeated the second
part of the third experiment but conﬁgured H and D to
vary their transmission power on a per-slot basis. The
power was varied to reduce the inference capability of
A. Speciﬁcally, H and D oscillated their power at ran-
dom between 10dBm and 20dBm. Figure 9(b) shows the
same results when the distance between D and H was
also varied, with H moving towards A. We observe that
PH remains a random guess even when H is moved away
from D (comparison of PH in Figures 9(a) and 9(b)), in-
dicating that a power variation approach can account for
situations where H is not placed exactly on top of D. Dis-
tinguishing signals from D and H using RSS remains a
random guess even when H is 2ft away from D.
6.1.2 Fast Helper Detection Based on Time
In this section, we discuss an inference technique that ex-
ploits the possible time misalignment between the trans-
missions of H and D due to clock drift and different path
delays to the receiver. There have been extensive studies
on synchronization of independent wireless nodes, but
practically it is impossible to reach perfect synchroniza-
tion [51]. The adversary can exploit the synchronization
offset between H and D to infer the presence of helper’s
ON signals. If H is faster (slower) than D, the ON slots
of H will appear slightly earlier (later) than the ON slots
of D. An example of a fast H is shown in Figure 10,

The lower part of Figure 10 shows an exam-
ple of applying the randomized start time for each bit.
We observe that no device is always faster (slower), thus
preventing A from ﬁxing its clock to H.
Experimental Evaluation of pI: To verify the valid-
ity of our time randomization approach and its impact
on the inference probability pI, we setup three NI-USRP
2921 devices in an indoor laboratory environment as D,
H, and A, respectively. As in previous experiments, H
was stacked on top of D, whereas A was placed 24 feet
away from D,H. The transmit power for an ON slot was
set to 20dBm with a symbol duration of 1ms. An arti-
ﬁcial clock misalignment τ = 0.1msec was set between
H and D to emulate the maximum synchronization error.
We then varied the random time offset ε selected by H
and D. The experiment lasted for the transmission of 106
sequences of 40 bits each.
Figure 11 shows the fraction of slots for which each
device was detected to be faster as a function of the max-
imum synchronization error ε. We observe that for suf-
ﬁciently high values of ε, H is almost 50% of the time
faster than D. Practically, using time misalignment to
distinguish the helper becomes a random guess.
6.2 Protocol Evaluation
In the ﬁnal set of experiments, we evaluated the integrity
protection offered by HELP against an adversary capable
of canceling and injecting signals. We setup two USRP
devices stacked over each other as D and H, one device
(Rx1) at 24ft from D,H acting as the BS and a second
device RX2 set by RX1 that performed cancellation on
RX1. The transmitters and the receivers are shown in
Figure 12(a) and Figure 12(b), respectively. The dis-
tance between the two receivers was set to approximately
one wavelength λ to cause signal inversion at RX1. Af-
ter receiving the transmissions of D and H at Rx1 and
Rx2, cancellation was performed via signal processing in
MATLAB [34]. The signal of RX2 was added to RX1 to
cancel the transmission of D and H, whereas a random
signal was added to emulate A’s signal injection.
In the ﬁrst scenario, we transmitted MC ON-OFF se-
quences of length (cid:96) = {4,8,12,20}, while the helper was
inactive. We measured the probability δ of accepting A’s
random sequence at the BS (RX1). We also varied the
probability of successful cancellation pC by suppressing
cancellation for a corresponding fraction of bits. Fig-
ure 12(c), shows δ as a function of (cid:96) for various pC. We
observe that for high cancellation probability values pC,
a message cancellation/injection has a high success prob-
ability (close to one).
We repeated the experiment of the ﬁrst scenario in the
presence of H who transmitted at random slot locations
simultaneously with D. In the experiment, the adversary
