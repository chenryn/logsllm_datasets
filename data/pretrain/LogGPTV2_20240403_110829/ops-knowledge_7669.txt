Question: Alice suspects that one of the blocks in the blockchain she downloaded may have been compromised. She only has the hash of the final block from a trusted source. What method can she use to ascertain the integrity of the entire blockchain?
"A": "Alice can compare the hash of each downloaded block to the corresponding hash from the trusted source to identify any discrepancies.",
"B": "Alice can verify the integrity by checking the hash of the last block against the one from the trusted source; if they match, the blockchain is intact.",
"C": "Alice needs to find a new trusted source for each block to compare all individual block hashes.",
"D": "Alice can ignore the hash chain and instead rely on checking transaction data within each block for inconsistencies."
Answer: B
