should raise when `orient='columns'` and index is non_unique  
`orient='index'` and column is non_unique?
I'm trying out to_json and read_json on a data frame with 800k rows. However,
after calling to_json on the file, read_json gets back only 2k rows. This
happens if I call them in series or if I give to_json a filename and call the
filename with read_json. Judging by the size of the file, all the data is
being written (the json is roughly the size of the pickled data frame object).
Any idea what's going on?
