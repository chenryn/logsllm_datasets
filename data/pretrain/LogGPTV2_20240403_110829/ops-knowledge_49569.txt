User: I wrote a simple script to delete a few files from some directories, I have to delete all the .exe files and all the .dll files. I manage to delete the .exe files using os.remove("path_name") but when I am trying to delete the .dll files I get "Windows Error: [Error 267] The directory name is invalid". I am adding my code below and I hope someone can help me solve the problem.
for name in dirs:
    dirPath = RES_PATH + "\\" + name
    dirsInside = os.listdir(dirPath)
    LOG_FILE = open(dirPath + "\\log.log", 'w')
    for doc in dirsInside:
        if (".exe" in doc):
            os.remove(dirPath + "\\" + doc)
        elif (".dll" in doc):
            shutil.rmtree(os.path.join(dirPath, doc))
        if ("ResultFile.txt" in doc):
            pathToResultFile = dirPath + "\\" + doc
            fileResult = open(pathToResultFile, 'r')
            lines = fileResult.readlines()

thanks in advance. 
EDIT
when I am trying to use the os.unlink() I get:
"WindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied"
for the .dll file (the .exe file is deleted as it should)
Assistant: Because it is .dll that you are trying to delete there is  a big chance that the file is in use, and therefore can't be deleted.
Try to see if you can delete it manually first.
