In Node we have os.EOL which abstracts the OS.
In Deno we have std/fs/eol which is an os-invariant enumeration. The docs for
writeFile and similar just use denormalized `\n`.
Is this a case where we can prefer the Node pattern over the Go pattern, or is
there some other recommended way to do this sort of thing? I'm simply trying
to write a file with line breaks.
