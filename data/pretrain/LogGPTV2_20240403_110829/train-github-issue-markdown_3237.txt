 **Alexander Shabanov** opened **SPR-9828** and commented
The proposed improvement is to modify signature for each
org.springframework.util.Assert.* method so that it will return the checked
value to let programmer to make check and assignment in "one turn".
This would improve readability of the initializers that uses spring's Assert
and minimize the code, e.g. instead of having to write
notNull(foo, "Foo can't be null"); // static import omitted for clarity  
hasText(bar, "Bar can't be empty");  
this.foo = foo;  
this.bar = bar;
someone can write
this.foo = notNull(foo, "Foo can't be null");  
this.bar = hasText(bar, "Bar can't be empty");
