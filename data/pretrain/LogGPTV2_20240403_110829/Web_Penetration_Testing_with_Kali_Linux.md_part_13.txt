Hamster and Ferret
Hamster is a utility used to steal cookies using HTTP session hijacking with passive
sniffing also known as Sidejacking. Hamster eavesdrops on a network, captures any
seen session cookies, and imports stolen cookies into a browser GUI environment so
the attacker can replay the session. Hamster uses Ferret to grab session cookies.
Hamster can be accessed by navigating to Sniffing/Spoofing | WebSniffers and
selecting Hamster.
When you launch Hamster, a Terminal will open starting the Hamster service. The
default proxy IP will be 127.0.0.1:1234.
You can access Hamster by opening a browser and navigating to
http://127.0.0.1:1234.

Traffic must travel through Hamster for it to do its job. You can select which adapter
to use by clicking the adapters link. For my example, I'm going to sniff eth0.
Hamster will redirect you to a Sidejacking activity page. You will notice you are not
receiving any packets. Hamster needs a sniffer to grab traffic. You can use Ferret
by accessing Sniffing/Spoofing | Web Sniffers and selecting Ferret. A Terminal
window will pop up with some options. Type in ferret -i INTERFACE to select
the interface to sniff with Ferret. Ferret will tell you it's sniffing and the command
prompt will hang in a running state. As you see traffic, the traffic capture will appear
as text in Ferret.

Once Ferret is running, navigate back to Hamster, and you should start to
see packets. Any targets on the network will appear. Click on a target to see
captured cookies.
Click on any cookie to access the capture session. In my example, I replay accessing

Man-in-the-middle attack
A man-in-the-middle attack is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker
makes a connection with victims and relays messages between victims, making them
believe they are talking directly to each other. There are many forms of this attack,
such as using a Hak5 Pineapple wireless router that pretends to be a trusted wireless
access point while really acting as a man-in-the-middle between a victim and
wireless network. Another example is using Kali to forward traffic between a victim
and default router while sniffing for useful information, such as login credentials.
Many cloud services such as Facebook and Gmail leverage secure login
via HTTPS, which prevents a generic man-in-the-middle attack. To bypass
HTTP Secure, you can use SSLstrip, which will reveal all login information
to your man-in-the-middle attack. The SSLstrip / man-in-the-middle
combination is a very effective method to steal victim's login credentials, if
you have an attack system on the same network as the target system(s).
dsniff and arpspoof
dsniff is a set of password sniffing and network traffic analysis tools designed to
parse different application protocols and extract relevant information.
arpspoof is used when an attacker sends fake address resolution protocol (ARP)
messages into a local area network. The goal of this process is to associate the
attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host, causing any traffic
meant for the IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.
One manual method to perform a man-in-the-middle is using arpspoof and dsniff
to sit between systems. The first step is identifying the IP address of your victim
and default gateway of the network using techniques from Chapter 2, Reconnaissance
– Core Concepts, Once you know the IP addresses, you need to tell your victim you
are really another system or the default gateway. For example, if victim one is
172.16.76.128, the default gateway is 172.16.76.2, and the attacker is 172.16.76.131,
you would set your 131 IP address to look like the victim and default gateway using
the arpspoof command.
Open two Terminal windows and type the following commands in each window to
spoof your victims:
[ 193 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Attacking Authentication
TERMINAL 1:
arpspoof -t 172.16.76.128 172.16.76.2 // tells victim 2 you are the
default gateway
TERMINAL 2:
arpspoof -t 172.16.76.2 172.16.76.128 // tells victim 1 you are the
default gateway
If you enter the commands correctly, you should see that traffic is being replayed
through the attacking system. Traffic is not going to and from the victim, so the
victim would not see traffic going out of the network at this point. To complete the
attack, you need to enable IP forward so traffic will continue to flow from the default
gateway to the victim and vice versa, while the attacker is watching traffic between
the victim and default gateway.
Open a third Terminal window and type:
echo 1> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
At this point, traffic should be flowing between the victim and default gateway while
going through the attacker system. The following screenshot shows the ping fail
while IP forward is not enabled.
[ 194 ]

Chapter 5
Next, launch dsniff to watch the traffic. dsniff can be found under Sniffing/Spoofing
| Network Sniffers, and selecting dsniff. A Terminal window will open, displaying
the usage commands for dsniff, as shown in the following screenshot:
To start dsniff, type dsniff and select the interface to sniff using -i and the
interface. For my example, I typed dsniff to sniff all traffic on eth0 as shown
in the following screenshot:
dsniff will catch any login information. If a victim logs into a system via FTP for
example, you will see the login attempt and credentials once the session is closed,
because dsniff needs to see the entire session.

Ettercap
Ettercap is a free and open source comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle-based
attacks.
Ettercap can be used for computer network protocol analysis and security auditing,
featuring sniffing live connections, content filtering, and support for active and passive
dissection of multiple protocols. Ettercap works by putting the attacker's network
interface into promiscuous mode and ARP for poisoning the victim machines.
To launch Ettercap, navigate to Sniffing/Spoofing | Network Sniffers and select
the Ettercap graphical.
The first step is selecting what interface you plan to sniff. Navigate to the Sniff tab,
select sniffing type (Unified sniffing or Bridged sniffing) and the interface you plan
to sniff.
[ 196 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 5
Now; Ettercap will show more menu options, as shown in the following screenshot:
Let's scan the network for available hosts. Navigate to the Hosts and select Scan for
hosts. Ettercap will quickly scan the entire class C and list all identified hosts. Usually
the router is the first host that is found. The following screenshot shows four devices
found during a scan.
In this example, we found four devices. We can assume .1 is the router, and we
will be targeting the victim machine .128. Let's select the router for Target 1 and
the victim .128 for Target 2. This will place our system between both the victim
and router for a classic man-in-the-middle attack. Select each target, and click the
appropriate check box. You can verify the targets by navigating to Targets and
selecting Current Targets.

Next, we can look at the man-in-the-middle options found under the tab Mitm.
There are options for Arp poisoning..., ICMP redirect..., Port stealing..., and Dhcp
spoofing.... For this example, we will select Arp poisoning... and choose the Sniff
remote connections parameter.
Now, we are ready to capture traffic between the router and our victim. Interesting
information, such as username and password information, can be captured and
displayed in the execution window.
Driftnet
Driftnet is a man-in-the-middle tool used to capture images from live network traffic.
Driftnet requires a man-in-the-middle attack to be established prior to working. You
can leverage the arpspoof and dsniff or Etthercap methods previously covered to
launch your man-in-the-middle attack prior to launching Driftnet. Driftnet can be
run simultaneously to give you quickly the visibility of all images flying across
the wire.
[ 198 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 5
Driftnet can be found under Sniffing/Spoofing | Web Sniffers and selecting
Driftnet. Driftnet will open as a Terminal displaying how to use the tool. You will
need to specify which interface you want to sniff and what you want to do with
images captured off the wire. For example, you can choose to have a beep sound
for every image using the –b command, display images on the terminal screen, or
send captured images to a directory. The screenshot provided shows an example of
capturing images from eth0 and placing those images in a folder located at /root/
Desktop/CapturedImages.
The following example assumes an existing man-in-the-middle attack is
established using eth0 as the listening port.
Once Driftnet is launched, a separate blank Terminal window will pop up. If you
have told Driftnet to display images, they will appear in this window. If you selected
not to display images, such as using –a, images will not appear; however, be sent to
the folder specified in the execution command. The following screenshot is driftnet
capturing images from a victim surfing to www.drchaos.com.

SQL Injection
A database stores data and organizes it in some sort of logical manner. Oracle and
Microsoft SQL are popular examples of database management systems that allow
users to create multiple types of databases used to store, query, and organize data
in creative ways.
Structured Query Language, which is better known as SQL, is the underlining
common programing language that is understood by most database management
systems. It provides a common way for application to access the data in the database
by using a common set of commands the database can understand.
Attackers exploit these databases by making them output information that they
should not be displaying. Sometimes this is as simple as the attacker asking for
privileged information from the database management system. Other times, it is
taking advantage of poor configurations by database administrators. Attackers may
also take advantage of a vulnerability in the database management system that
allows the attacker to view or write privileged commands to and from the database.
Attackers typically send malicious code through forms or other parts of a webpage
that have the ability to accept user input. For example, an attacker may enter random
characters, as well as long statements, with the goal of identifying weakness in how
the input variables and parameters are designed. If an input field is set to only accept
usernames up to 15 characters long, an error message may appear revealing details
about how the database is configured.
The Firefox plugin HackBar will let you test SQL queries and inject your own queries
for changing SQL requests. The HackBar plugin will also let a Penetration Tester
examine HTTP post information.

Chapter 5
In the following example, we will try to perform a SQL injection on the website
DrChaos.com. Let's navigate to www.DrChaos.com using Firefox on our Kali
server console and try to log into the website. First, we will try the username
administrator and the password 12345 to login. You should see that will fail.
Now, navigate to the View menu bar in Firefox and select the HackBar menu. Click
the Load URL button and click the Enable Post data button. You will see the URL we
were logging into as well as the username and password we just attempted.

Attacking Authentication
We will now add a single quotation mark after the administrator username. Soon as
we click on the Execute button, we receive a SQL injection. This may mean the server
is vulnerable to SQL injection, because the server is responding to SQL errors.
We will put in SQL injection by adding an OR 1=1 ## statement at the end of
the line.
Once we execute the code, we are logged on as administrator to www.drchaos.com.
[ 202 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 5
We have patched www.DrChaos.com so it is no longer vulnerable to this attack.
However, you can see SQL injections are very valuable to attack, because they
give a web Penetration Tester an easy method to gain full access to a system.
SQL injection success is dependent on the attackers knowledge of SQL commands. If
you need to brush up on your SQL skills, we recommend looking at W3 School of SQL
at: http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp.
sqlmap
sqlmap automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and
taking over of database servers. sqlmap comes with a detection engine, as well as a
broad range of Penetration Testing features that range from database fingerprinting
to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating
system via out-of-band connections.
Features include support for common database management systems, support for
many SQL injection techniques, enumerating users, password hashes, and many
others. sqlmap also supports database process' user privilege escalation using
Metasploit's Meterpreter getsystem command.
sqlmap is a tool that can be used to exploit database servers and is built into Kali. To
use sqlmap, you will need to point the tool to a URL of a SQL script on a webserver.
These can be identified because they usually have php in the URL.
You can find sqlmap under Vulnerabilty Analysis | Database Assessment |
sqlmap. A Terminal window will open displaying the sqlmap help page.
The basic syntax to use sqlmap is:
sqlmap –u URL -- function
A common function is dbs. The dbs keyword will have sqlmap get the databases.
sqlmap -u http://www.drchaous.com/article.php?id=5 --dbs
You can see from our results we have several databases that were found. For this
example, we will concentrate on the test database.
[ 203 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Attacking Authentication
Once you have found a vulnerable web server, you select the database by using the
–D command and the name of the database.
sqlmap –u http://www.drchaos.com/article.php?id=5 -D test --tables
The table keyword is used to retrieve all the tables in the test database on our web
server. We see we have successfully retrieved two tables, admin and content.
Once you issue the following command, sqlmap will display all tables:
sqlmap -u http://www.drchaous.com/article.php?id=5 -D test --tables
Specific columns can be selected by using the following command:
sqlmap -u http://www.drchaous.com/article.php?id=5 -T tablesnamehere
--columns
If there is any relevant information in the tables, it can be retrieved using the
following command:
sqlmap -u http://www.drchaous.com/article.php?id=5 -T tablesnamehere -U
test --dump
-U test –dump
This will create a file named test, and dump all the raw information from the
database table to that file. In many cases, this can include passwords and other
sensitive information.
Cross-site scripting (XSS)
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability found on web applications. XSS allows
attackers to inject scripts into the website. These scripts can be used to manipulate
the web server, or the clients connecting to the web server.
Cross-site scripting has accounted for a large majority of popular web-based attacks.
Many times when my team is requested by customers to examine compromised
web servers that have had data stolen, it has been a result of cross-site scripting.
Cross-site scripting attacks have resulted in attackers defacing websites, distributing
malware to clients, and stealing sensitive information from websites, such as credit
card and other personal identifiable information.
[ 204 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 5
One method to check for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities is checking if an input
field, such as a search box, is vulnerable. An example that could be used to test an
input field on a website is using the simple search string as follows:
CHAOS
You could use the previous script to test any website however, we don't recommend
inputting the string on every website you come across, as it could alert targets of your
malicious intentions. If you chose to use a similar script for testing cross-site scripting,
make sure to use another website other than www.DrChaos.com in the script.
Testing cross-site scripting
Google has created the Gruyere project as a means to test web application exploits
and defenses .The Gruyere project website has several vulnerabilities embedded
into it, including XSS. You can run your own Gruyere project online, or you can
download it to a local machine for your testing.
Once we were logged into our own instance of Gruyere, we were able to copy the
previous string into the username input field and clicked the Submit button. The
following screenshot shows the Gruyere home page with the CHAOS script displayed.
The string used in input field is as follows:
CHAOS

Attacking Authentication
Once we ran the XSS script in the username input field, we noticed some code was
displayed on the website. At this point, we were able to generate a pop-up alert
anytime the username was seen on the website.
In addition, http://xss.progphp.com/ is another popular site to test XSS attacks
and scripts. You can take several scripts and input them into the website to see how
XSS interacts with websites and your own web browser safely.
XSS cookie stealing / Authentication
hijacking
Script kiddies may use XSS for generating pop-up alerts however, as a professional
Penetration Tester, the real value of XSS is to gain privileged access to a system.
The next section will examine how to do this. If you have not done so already, create
your own Gruyere instance online for testing the next section's concepts.
Navigate to http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/start. App Engine will start
a new instance of Gruyere for you, assign it a unique ID and redirect you to
http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/123456/ (where 123456 is the unique
ID for this example).
Each instance of Gruyere is completely isolated from any other instances, so your
instance won't be affected by anyone else using Gruyere. You'll need to use your
unique ID instead of 123456 in all the examples.
If you want to share your work and project you complete in Gruyere with someone
else (for example, to show them a successful attack), just share the full URL with
your friend including your unique ID.
Do not use the same password for your Gruyere account as you use for any real service.
Let's walk through an example of using a XSS vulnerability to steal a session cookie.
If you try this technique on a local network, your Kali box and vulnerable web server
must be able to communicate. Because we are using Gruyere project, we needed to
put our Kali Linux box on the Internet with a public facing IP address, so Kali Linux
can properly communicate with the target Gruyere server.
