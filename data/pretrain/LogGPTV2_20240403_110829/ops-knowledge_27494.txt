User:  Please explain what are the basic principles of object-oriented programming?
Assistant: The basic principles of object-oriented programming are the four core principles (SOLID principles), design principles, pattern principles, and practice principles. SOLID principles: 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class is only responsible for one function, following the principle of "high cohesion and low coupling". 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Open for extension and closed for modification, following the principle of "interface-oriented programming". 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The subclass can replace the call of the parent class anywhere, and the call of the parent class should not make mistakes, following the principle of "inheritance relationship". 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A class should not depend on interfaces it does not need, and the interface should provide customers with a small and refined interface, following the principle of "the customer's interface should only depend on the interface it needs". 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstraction, and follow the principle of "abstract should not depend on concrete implementation, and concrete implementation should depend on abstraction". Design principles: 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 2. Open Closed Principle (OCP) 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 6. Synthetic Reuse Principle (CRP): Reuse is better than inheritance to achieve loose coupling between classes. Pattern principle: The main purpose of design patterns is to provide a general solution and template to solve some common design problems. Commonly used design patterns include factory pattern, singleton pattern, observer pattern, decorator pattern, etc. Practical principles: Practical issues such as easy maintenance, easy expansion, convenient code reuse, strong code readability, and code performance should be considered when writing code. For example, use comments, reasonable naming conventions, code encapsulation, etc. to improve the readability and maintainability of the code. At the same time, you should also do a good job in code testing and other work to ensure the quality of the code.
