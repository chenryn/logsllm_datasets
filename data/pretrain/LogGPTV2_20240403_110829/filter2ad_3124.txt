ABSTRACT
How do anomalies, fraud, and spam eﬀect our models of nor-
mal user behavior? How can we modify our models to catch
fraudsters? In this tutorial we will answer these questions -
connecting graph analysis tools for user behavior modeling
to anomaly and fraud detection. In particular, we will focus
on three data mining techniques: subgraph analysis, label
propagation and latent factor models; and their application
to static graphs, e.g. social networks, evolving graphs, e.g.
“who-calls-whom” networks, and attributed graphs, e.g. the
“who-reviews-what” graphs of Amazon and Yelp.
For each of these techniques we will give an explanation of
the algorithms and the intuition behind them. We will then
give brief examples of recent research using the techniques
to model, understand and predict normal behavior. With
this intuition for how these methods are applied to graphs
and user behavior, we will focus on state-of-the-art research
showing how the outcomes of these methods are eﬀected by
fraud, and how they have been used to catch fraudsters.

1. TUTORIAL PERSPECTIVE
In this tutorial we focus on fraud, spam and anomaly de-
tection through the lens of normal user behavior modeling.
The data mining and machine learning communities have de-
veloped a plethora of models and methods for understanding
user behavior. However, these methods generally assume
that the behavior is that of real, honest people. On the
other hand, fraud detection systems frequently use similar

techniques as those used in modeling “normal” behavior, but
are often framed as an independent problem. However, by
focusing on the relations and intersections of the two per-
spectives we can gain a more complete understanding of the
methods and hopefully inspire new research joining these
two communities.
2. TARGET AUDIENCE
This tutorial is aimed at anyone interested in understand-
ing user behavior data, from data miners to security re-
searchers to practitioners from industry and government.
For those new to these algorithms, the tutorial will cover the
necessary background material to understand these systems
and will oﬀer a concise, intuitive overview of the state-of-
the-art in user behavior modeling. Additionally, the tutorial
aims to oﬀer a new perspective that will be valuable and in-
teresting even for researchers with more experience in these
domains. In particular, for those researchers having worked
on fraud detection systems, we hope to inspire new research
directions through connecting with recent developments in
modeling “normal” behavior.
