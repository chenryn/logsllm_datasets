When attempting to install the latest version of `matplotlib` using `pip`, I encountered the following error:

```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):

    if self.version < other.version:
TypeError: unorderable types: str() < int()
```

The issue was caused by the `freetype-config --ftversion` command returning unexpected output. The command's output was as follows:

```plaintext
freetype-config --ftversion
grep: warning: GREP_OPTIONS is deprecated; please use an alias or script
(...)
warning: GREP_OPTIONS is deprecated; please use an alias or script
2.5.2
```

The warnings were generated by `grep`, which was complaining about the `GREP_OPTIONS` environment variable being set. After unsetting this variable, the installation proceeded without errors. 

To resolve the issue, I executed the following command:

```bash
unset GREP_OPTIONS
```

After unsetting the `GREP_OPTIONS` variable, the `matplotlib` installation completed successfully.
