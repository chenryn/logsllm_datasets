User: As a newbie to app engine and python I can follow the examples given by Google and have created a python application with a template HTML page where I can enter data, submit it to the datastore and by reading back the data, just sent, recreate the sending page so I can continue adding data and store again.  However what I would like to do is submit the data, have it stored in the datastore without the sending page being refreshed. It seems like a waste of traffic to have all the data sent back again.
Assistant: Have a look at Pyjamas pyjs.org
It's a Python Compiler for web browsers. Write your client side in Python and Pyjamas will compile it into JavaScript.
