titleblackhat:us-21 DBREACH: Database Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression Heuristics
Databases often store sensitive data such as personally identifiable information. For this reason, databases often provide a data-at-rest encryption feature. Large databases may also attempt to compress data to save storage space. However, combining encryption and compression can be dangerous and potentially leak the underlying plaintext. This class of vulnerabilities is known as a compression side-channel. Compression side-channel attacks were most notably demonstrated during the CRIME (2012) and BREACH (2013) attacks to break SSL. In practice, compression side-channel attacks have so far been limited to a web security context. In this presentation, we demonstrate the first compression side-channel attacks on a real-world database. We show how an attacker is able to extract encrypted content that was inserted by another user.We list the necessary preconditions for such an attack to take place, reveal the inner workings of the attack, and discuss possible mitigations.
