User: How to do a good job in website security protection? Please list common security vulnerabilities and corresponding preventive measures.
Assistant: First of all, to do a good job in website security protection, you need to have the following common security defense measures: 1. Ensure website program updates: Regularly update the website program version to fix security loopholes and defects. 2. Use HTTPS: The website should enable HTTPS, and use an SSL certificate to provide a secure transmission protocol for the website to ensure the security of transmitted data. 3. Install a firewall: A firewall should be installed on the server to filter malicious access, and can block IP addresses with attack characteristics. 4. Enforce password policy: Remind users to use strong passwords and recommend changing them regularly. 5. Data backup: Regular backup of website data. Below are common security vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. 1. SQL injection: The attacker obtains sensitive data in the database by executing SQL commands. Precautions: - Validate input parameters - Use prepared statement processing - Application should have no privileges to access the database, use a database user with minimal privileges 2. CSRF: Attackers can perform authentication requests by exploiting the victim's identity. Preventive measures: - Verify the HTTP Referer header to ensure that the request comes from the same website - CSRF Token 3. XSS: Attack other users by injecting malicious script or HTML code. Precautions: - Filter user input, especially HTML code. - Use HTTP Content Security Policy (CSP). - Mark the cookie as "HttpOnly". 4. File reading vulnerability: Bad configuration may allow attackers to read or write important files. Precautions: - Check the file type. - Make sure important files are not accessed by HTTP servers. - Limit file upload size and type. 5. Unauthorized access: Attackers can access information they do not have permission to access. Precautions: - Use a strong authentication and authorization system - Minimize privileges - Make sure admin pages are encrypted. 6. Code injection vulnerability: An attacker can inject arbitrary code into the code. Precautions: - Check code execution. - Input validation. - Be wary of unsafe functions.
