Question: In configuring an Android device that uses metadata encryption, you need to adjust the init sequence to ensure that the `/data` partition mounts correctly at startup. Which of the following modifications to the init sequence are required to prevent potential deadlocks and ensure Keymaster is ready before `/data` is mounted?
"A": "Start vold after mounting `/data` to ensure filesystems are ready for encryption.",
"B": "Place `exec_start wait_for_keymaster` before the `mount_all` invocation related to `/data` in the init sequence.",
"C": "Run the vdc tool after `vold` starts to set up the metadata-encrypted device.",
"D": "Delay the startup of Keymaster until after `/data` has been successfully mounted."
Answer: B
