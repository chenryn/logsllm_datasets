**Description:**
Higaisa, a known threat actor, employs the tactic of adding a spoofed binary to the start-up folder to achieve persistence on the compromised system. This method ensures that the malicious code is executed each time the system boots, allowing the attacker to maintain long-term access.[117][118]
