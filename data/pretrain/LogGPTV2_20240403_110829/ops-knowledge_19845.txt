User: I have installed openstack on Ubuntu 12.04 single node using devstack. Now, it was running smoothly till yesterday. When i ran ./stack.sh today, it showed an error
./stack.sh:672 nova-api did not start
I have python-paste and python-pastedeploy installed. How to fix this error?
Assistant: General rule of thumb for devstack.
Always unstack.sh before re-running stack.sh or pulling from repositories and re-running stack.sh
