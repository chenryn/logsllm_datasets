User: I recently removed Macports and all its packages and installed Python, Gphoto and some other bits using Homebrew. However python is crashing when looking for libraries as it is looking for them in a MacPorts path. My PATH is correct and the python config show the right path /usr/local/Cellar etc. 
Can someone tell me how to set Python to use the libraries installed via Homebrew, I suppose change the path effectively?
Assistant: I wouldn't use the Macports packages in Homebrew. I'd reinstall them all.  A lot of Python packages are compiled , or at least have compiled elements.  You're asking for a lot of potential troubles mixing them up.
