this scares the slave.
Is it theoretically possible for a RAT to dis-
able this light? [47]
disturbingly referring to his victim as “the slave,” as is
common in this subcommunity. The ﬁrst response by
“Jabaar” notes that “[p]eople have been trying to ﬁgure
this out for a very long time. The light won’t be able to
be disabled as it is built into the hardware.” Others agree:
“Capital Steez” writes that there is “no way to disable it,”
and “FBITM” concurs “there [i]s no way to do” it. Still
others suggest using social engineering in an attempt to
convince the victim that the LED is normal, for example,
“Orochimaru” writes, “You can’t physically turn it off but
you can use social engineering to fool them. Maybe send
an error or warning msgbox that says ‘Camera is now
updating, please do not disturb’ or something.” There are
many such threads on Hack Forums alone, all expressing
similar sentiments: disabling LEDs is a capability the
ratters really want to have but do not think is possible.
Unfortunately, the implications of surreptitiously cap-
turing video do not end with privacy violations like law
enforcement, school ofﬁcials, and ratters spying on peo-
ple. As part of the general trend of growing frustration
with passwords as an authentication mechanism, some
companies are moving to biometric identiﬁcation; in
particular, using facial recognition on video taken with
webcams. For example, BioID is software-as-a-service
which provides biometric identiﬁcation to online service
providers using a webcam [8]. Luxand’s FaceSDK is
a cross-platform software development kit that uses the
webcam to identify the user [34].
In principle, this sort of facial recognition is trivially
defeated by providing the expected picture or video to
the software performing the authentication. Malware that

can capture video of the victim can replay that video to
authenticate to the given service. This is not a new attack.
The Android Face Unlock system was defeated shortly
after being released by holding a picture of the face in
front of the camera [9]. Duc and Minh [16] describes
weaknesses of several facial recognition authentication
systems in the presence of pictures. By disabling the
indicator LED before capturing video, the victims have no
way of knowing that their accounts may be compromised.
Although the ability to disable the LED can lead to
serious privacy and security problems, there are at least
two legitimate use cases. The ﬁrst is that some people
really do not want the LED on while they are recording.
We do not ﬁnd this to be a compelling use as the beneﬁt
does not seem to outweigh the potential cost; however,
others may value this more than we do.
The second use case is signiﬁcantly more compelling:
laptop recovery. For example, the OS X version of
Adeona software captures pictures using the laptop’s in-
ternal iSight to aid in recovery of a laptop that has been
stolen by taking a picture of the thief [51, 52]. The LAN-
rev software used in the Lower Merion School District
incident discussed in the introduction had a similar “Theft
Track” feature which is how the school ofﬁcials were able
to obtain pictures of students. For this use, one does not
want the thief to know he is being observed.
10 Responsible disclosure
The authors followed responsible disclosure practices by
disclosing the LED disabling vulnerability to Apple prod-
uct security team on July 16, 2013 and the virtual machine
escape on August 1, 2013. The disclosures included the
source code for iSeeYou and the virtual machine escape
as well as directions for mounting both attacks. Apple
employees followed up several times but did not inform
us of any possible mitigation plans. The iSightDefender
code was also provided to Apple and is now publicly
available.11
11 Conclusions and future work
Engineering details of privacy technologies can have real-
world consequences. As discussed in Sections 1 and 9,
a computer user today potentially faces a variety of ad-
versaries — from law enforcement and school ofﬁcials to
criminals — who want to capture images or video clandes-
tinely. Currently, the only technological barrier standing
in their way is the camera-on indicator LED. We have
shown that, at least in some cases, the barrier can be
overcome.
In particular, we have shown that being able to repro-
gram the iSight from user space is a powerful capability.
Coupled with the hardware design ﬂaw that allows the
11See supra note 9.
indicator LED hardware interlocks to be bypassed, mal-
ware is able to covertly capture video, either for spying
purposes or as part of a broader scheme to break facial
recognition authentication. Although the iSightDefender
defense described in Section 7 raises the barrier for mal-
ware, including RATs, to take control of the camera with-
out being detected by requiring root privileges, the correct
way to prevent disabling the LED is a hardware solution.
In this paper, we have examined only a single genera-
tion of webcams produced by a single manufacturer. In
future work, we plan to expand the scope of our inves-
tigation to include newer Apple webcams (such as their
most recent high-deﬁnition FaceTime cameras) as well as
webcams installed in other popular laptop brands.
The virtual machine escape described in Appendix A
demonstrates the danger that reprogrammable peripheral
devices such as keyboards and mice pose. We plan to
undertake a much broader examination of these devices
in an attempt to understand the security implications of
connecting one device to a computer which can, under at-
tacker control, pretend to be a wide range of devices. One
particularly promising direction is to study how drivers
react to malformed or malicious responses from devices.
In the worst case, a user space program could reprogram
a peripheral device which in turn exploits a poorly written
driver to inject code into the kernel.
