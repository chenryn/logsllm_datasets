Hello,
I'm a CG artist and I'm working in 3d studio max (among other software) and
the program has a lot of separate windows that need to be in view all the
time. Therefore I bought a new big 45" monitor so I can view all the windows
and settings at once. Unfortunately Fance zones doesn't work with programs
that have multiple windows within the same program so snapping the main window
to a zone works but snapping the other ones to other zones doesn't work.
When I saw PowerToys for the first time and noticed that Fancy Zones feature
it actually had me come up with the idea to buy such a big monitor. I would
very much like to be able to snap those windows to their zones and improve my
workflow this way.
Thanks in advance.
