5 Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we proposed a new single-hop unidirectional CP-ABPRE scheme, which supports
attribute-based re-encryption with any monotonic access structure, to tackle the open problem left
by the existing CP-ABPRE schemes. We also showed that our scheme can be proved IND-sAS-CCA
secure in the random oracle model assuming the decisional q-parallel BDHE assumption holds.
Removing the ROM. The technique introduced in [19,27] might be a possible approach to
remove random oracles. We leave this as our future work.
This paper also motivates some interesting open problems, for example, how to construct a CCA
secure CP-ABPRE scheme in the adaptive access structure model, i.e. achieving IND-aAS-CCA secu-
rity.

A Proof of Theorem 1
Proof. In the IND-sAS-CCA-Or game, A can achieve the following re-encryption keys from Ork:
rkS→(M(cid:48),ρ(cid:48)) and rkS(cid:48)→(M(cid:48)(cid:48),ρ(cid:48)(cid:48)), where S |= (M∗, ρ∗) and S(cid:48)
|= (M(cid:48), ρ(cid:48)). Following the restrictions
deﬁned in the game, A cannot query the private key skS(cid:48) for any S(cid:48) |= (M(cid:48), ρ(cid:48))12 but the private key
skS(cid:48)(cid:48) for any S(cid:48)(cid:48) |= (M(cid:48)(cid:48), ρ(cid:48)(cid:48)).
Suppose an IND-sAS-CCA-Or secure CP-ABPRE scheme is not selective collusion resistant. Then
A is able to compromise the private key skS(cid:48) from rkS(cid:48)→(M(cid:48)(cid:48),ρ(cid:48)(cid:48)) and skS(cid:48)(cid:48). Using rkS→(M(cid:48),ρ(cid:48)), A can
(M(cid:48),ρ(cid:48)). A then decrypts the re-encrypted ciphertext
