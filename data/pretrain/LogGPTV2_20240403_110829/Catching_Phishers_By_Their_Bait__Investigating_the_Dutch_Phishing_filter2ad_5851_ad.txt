Porkbun and GoDaddy.com are signiﬁcantly less popular than
one would expect. Another interesting observation is the use
of REG.RU, a Russian domain registrar, which is found 46
times in our dataset. An overview of the 10 most popular
domain registrars can be found in the middle of Table 6.
Certiﬁcates authorities The fourth step in the end-to-end
life cycle of a phishing campaign is acquiring a TLS certiﬁ-
cate. As explained in Section 3.2, we leverage this step to
detect phishing domains in our analysis. Let’s Encrypt is the
main supplier of TLS certiﬁcates in our dataset, as 67% of
all FQDNs use such free certiﬁcates. Additionally, we found
146 domains with a certiﬁcate issued by cPanel, software of-
ten used to manage the domain. Most certiﬁcates (99%) are
Domain Validated (DV), but we gathered 33 TLS certiﬁcates
issued through CloudFlare’s free certiﬁcate service which
were Organisation Validated (OV). These certiﬁcates require
additional validation steps which are highly unlikely for a
phisher to fulﬁll, as this would disclose their identity.
6 Phishing website deployments
In the four month data collection period, our domain crawler
made a total of 499,497 visits to 7,936 unique FQDNs. As
explained in Section 3.3, the crawler visits every domain
labeled as potential phishing by our domain detector and
monitors it for a period of a maximum of seven days after
initial discovery. Properties such as the used phishing kit, the
IP address and WHOIS record are gathered during this process.
Besides choosing a suitable TLD and a domain name to be
used for their phishing attack, phishers also need a place to
host their website. By resolving the IP addresses of identiﬁed
phishing domains and mapping them to their corresponding
Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), we determined the
hosting provider of each domain. An overview of the top ten
providers can be found in Table 6. Similar to the domain
registrations mentioned in Section 5, Namecheap is the most
popular hosting provider among attackers in our dataset. The
overall popularity of Namecheap has various reasons. First of
all, it is – like it says – cheap and as attackers want to max-
imise their proﬁts, it makes sense to rent an inexpensive VPS
instead of an expensive one. Second, Namecheap accepts pay-
ments in Bitcoin [36], which offers more operations security
to attackers due to the relative anonymity of Bitcoin transac-
tions. Finally, it is mentioned explicitly by various phishing
kit creators in their manuals.
Surprisingly, none of the hosting providers in this list can be
regarded as bulletproof – i.e., very reluctant to LEA requests
– except from HS, short for Host Sailor. This provider does
have a disreputable background [24], but is used by only 58
domains in our dataset. Another interesting entry in Table 6
is Combahton, an inexpensive German hosting provider used
by services like zap-webspace.de and gamingweb.de. From
the lack of bulletproof hosting providers we derive that these
phishers are not concerned about an extended lifespan of their
domain. As long as they act quickly, they are long-gone before
their domain is taken ofﬂine by third-parties. However, the
choice of these services does open avenues up for possible law
enforcement interventions, as mainstream hosting providers
– such as Namecheap – are willing to cooperate with law
enforcement.
6.1 Phishing kit prevalence
As stated in Section 4.2, we obtained a total of 70 phishing
kits, which we dissected and grouped into 10 families of
similar kits. During the data collection period, our crawler
found matching ﬁngerprints for 7 of the 10 different families.
We show the size of the Dutch phishing landscape and the
popularity of the different phishing kit families in Figure 8, in
which the total number of active and online phishing domains
are shown per day, categorized per phishing kit family.
Although we expected a wide variety of phishing kits to be
used, the opposite turned out to be true. The overwhelming
majority of phishing domains our detector found was made

Figure 8: Number of domains active per day, grouped per phishing kit family (n = 1,363)
using one of many variants of phishing kits within the uAdmin
family. Almost 89% of all identiﬁed phishing websites were
made with a kit within this family, shown by the size of the
lower blue bars in Figure 8. As explained in Section 4.2, these
phishing kits contain many templates for different banks and
often include decoy pages, making them attractive to aspiring
phishers. The support for many different bank login templates
also explains why many of the domains are labeled as ‘multi-
ple’ in Figure 8. These domains have ﬁngerprint matches of
both uAdmin and another phishing kit family. It seems that
phishing kit creators are integrating as many templates as
possible from different kits into the uAdmin framework. The
structure of this framework remains often unchanged, as we
could locate the control panel on its default location on 775
of the 1,211 FQDNs (64%) that matched a ﬁngerprint of a
phishing kit in the uAdmin family. Finally, as shown in red
in Figure 8, the category unknown consists of new, unknown
phishing kits found on live phishing domains. As explained
in Section 3.4, we manually veriﬁed that these domains were
indeed phishing, and created ﬁngerprints of the used kits ac-
cording to the characteristics of these live domains.
6.2 Campaign duration
Since our crawler monitored each identiﬁed phishing domain
for a maximum of seven days (168 hours), we were able
to closely follow these domains and capture the end-to-end
life cycle of a typical phishing campaign. Additionally, as
stated before in Section 5, we manually checked the dataset
Figure 9: Histogram of phishing domain uptimes, domains
with multiple certiﬁcates included (n = 1,363)
to prevent any false positives from being included in the data
and only included domains with a complete end-to-end life
cycle in our analysis, which allowed us to analyze this in the
next paragraphs.
First, we plot a histogram of the uptimes of all domains in
our dataset in Figure 9 with a logarithmic Y-axis. As one can
see, the majority of domains have an uptime of 0 to 200 hours,
which coincides with our maximum analysis period of 168
hours. However, there are 75 domains with an uptime of more
than 168 hours (7 days). After manually inspecting this unex-
pected result, we found that these domains requested multiple
TLS certiﬁcates during their uptime, which caused our do-
main crawler to restart the crawling cycle as soon as a new
certiﬁcate was issued. Since these outliers heavily inﬂuence
the results and prevent us from determining timestamps of
the steps in the life cycle, we exclude them for the remainder
of the analysis in this paragraph.

ing phishing domains in our dataset. On average, a phishing
domain in our dataset is online for 45 hours, but we ﬁnd a
median uptime of 24 hours. The uptimes are shown as a cumu-
lative distribution function (CDF) in Figure 10. Thus, 50% of
all domains have a lifespan less than a day, whereas just over
30% is online for more than two days. These numbers again
stress the fact that speed is key in anti-phishing initiatives.
Installation of phishing kits Although it is hard to deter-
mine which actors are behind phishing attacks on Dutch con-
sumers, the timestamps of the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of an active
phishing kit installation does give some clues into the region
of the world these attackers operate from. And as shown in
Figure 11, the phishing kit installation times (in UTC+1) line
up nicely with the Dutch circadian rhythm. Most phishing
kits are installed successfully during the day, whilst almost
none of them are installed in the middle of the night. This
ﬁnding, and the fact that most manuals of the gathered phish-
ing kits are written in Dutch, extends the conclusions of Han
et al. [17], as this would indicate that both victim and attacker
originate from the same country.
During installation and testing of the kit, visitors are occa-
sionally redirected to popular benign domains like Google or
Bing, or to the website of the target organization. During our
crawls, we observed 49 different phishing domains doing this
before their phishing kit was fully deployed and operational.
End-to-end life cycle steps We can determine timestamps
of all steps within a typical phishing campaign – shown in Fig-
ure 2 and explained in Section 2 – by combining the retrieved
WHOIS records and crawling timestamps of all identiﬁed phish-
ing domains. Unfortunately, 460 FQDNs in our dataset lack
WHOIS information due to inconsistent information formatting
or server errors beyond our control. Therefore, these domains
are excluded from the analysis in this paragraph. Additionally,
we focus this analysis on type IV phishing domains only. As
type III domains include hijacked domains which have not
been registered purposefully for phishing.
The end-to-end life cycle analysis on the remaining 818
domains is summarized in Figure 12 as a horizontal box plot,
with the hours since domain registration on a logarithmic
X-axis. As indicated by the red bars inside the boxes, a phish-
ing domain is online – i.e., returns a successful HTTP 200
response – three hours after registration on average. Often-
times, quickly followed by the installation of a phishing kit,
on average only one hour later. After a successful installation,
the phisher sends out the bait to its potential victims and waits
for credentials to be ﬁlled in. The domain goes ofﬂine after 40
hours on average. The majority of domains complete this full
life cycle within a couple of days. Note however, that there are
also outliers. In these cases, the domain was registered many
days in advance, waiting to be used by the attacker. In our
dataset, only 114 of the 818 domains (14%) were registered
more than 24 hours before coming online.
6.3 External resources & evasion techniques
During our analysis of phishing domains in the wild, we
noticed that some websites make external connections. As
explained in the Section 4.1, phishing websites could either
include all impersonated resources – e.g., JavaScript, CSS
and images – on the domain, or refer to resources hosted
externally. Analyzing the resources loaded by all identiﬁed
phishing domains tells us that only 104 domains (7.6% of the
total dataset) load their resources directly from their benign
counterparts. This ﬁnding contradicts the assumption under-
lying the work of Oest et al. [39] and makes their method of
