### Domain Registrars and Their Popularity
Porkbun and GoDaddy.com are significantly less popular than expected. Interestingly, REG.RU, a Russian domain registrar, appears 46 times in our dataset. The top 10 most popular domain registrars are listed in Table 6.

### Certificate Authorities
The fourth step in the end-to-end life cycle of a phishing campaign is acquiring a TLS certificate. We use this step to detect phishing domains. Let’s Encrypt is the primary provider, with 67% of all FQDNs using their free certificates. Additionally, 146 domains have certificates issued by cPanel, a common domain management software. Most certificates (99%) are Domain Validated (DV), but we found 33 TLS certificates issued through CloudFlare’s free service that were Organization Validated (OV). These OV certificates require additional validation steps, making it highly unlikely for phishers to obtain them as it would reveal their identity.

### Phishing Website Deployments
During the four-month data collection period, our domain crawler visited 499,497 unique FQDNs across 7,936 potential phishing domains. The crawler monitors each domain for up to seven days after initial detection, gathering properties such as the used phishing kit, IP address, and WHOIS record.

Phishers need a hosting provider for their websites. By resolving the IP addresses of identified phishing domains and mapping them to their corresponding Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), we determined the hosting providers. Namecheap is the most popular hosting provider among attackers, likely due to its affordability and acceptance of Bitcoin payments, which offer more operational security. Surprisingly, only Host Sailor (HS) can be considered a bulletproof hosting provider, but it is used by only 58 domains in our dataset. This suggests that phishers are not overly concerned about the longevity of their domains, as they can act quickly before being taken offline.

### Phishing Kit Prevalence
We obtained 70 phishing kits, grouped into 10 families. Our crawler found matching fingerprints for 7 of these families. Figure 8 shows the size of the Dutch phishing landscape and the popularity of different phishing kit families. The majority of phishing domains (89%) were created using variants of the uAdmin family, which includes many templates for different banks and decoy pages. The control panel was located at its default location on 775 out of 1,211 FQDNs (64%). New, unknown phishing kits are shown in red in Figure 8.

### Campaign Duration
Our crawler monitored each identified phishing domain for up to seven days, allowing us to capture the end-to-end life cycle of a typical phishing campaign. A histogram of the uptimes of all domains in our dataset (Figure 9) shows that the majority of domains have an uptime of 0 to 200 hours. After excluding outliers, the average uptime of the remaining 1,288 phishing domains is 45 hours, with a median of 24 hours. This highlights the importance of speed in anti-phishing initiatives.

### Installation of Phishing Kits
The timestamps of the first identification of active phishing kit installations provide clues about the regions where attackers operate. Figure 11 shows that installation times align with the Dutch circadian rhythm, suggesting that both victims and attackers may originate from the same country. During installation, visitors are occasionally redirected to benign domains like Google or Bing, or to the target organization's website.

### End-to-End Life Cycle Steps
By combining WHOIS records and crawling timestamps, we can determine the timestamps of all steps in a typical phishing campaign. Figure 12 summarizes the end-to-end life cycle for 818 type IV phishing domains. On average, a phishing domain goes online three hours after registration, followed by the installation of a phishing kit one hour later. The domain typically goes offline after 40 hours. Only 114 out of 818 domains (14%) were registered more than 24 hours before coming online.

### External Resources and Evasion Techniques
Some phishing websites make external connections, either including all impersonated resources on the domain or referring to externally hosted resources. Only 104 domains (7.6% of the total dataset) load their resources directly from their benign counterparts, contradicting the assumption in Oest et al. [39].
