User: I'm learning python now using a mac which pre-installed python 2.7.5. But I have also installed the latest 3.4.
I know how to choose which interpreter to use in command line mode, ie python vs python 3 will bring up the respective interpreter. 
But if I just write a python script with this header in it "#!/usr/bin/python" and make it executable, how can I force it to use 3.4 instead of 2.7.5?
As it stands, print sys.version says:
2.7.5 (default, Aug 25 2013, 00:04:04) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)]
Assistant: You know, you can start python with py -specific version 
To run a script on interpreter with a specific version you'll just start your script with following parameters, py yourscript.py -version
