User: When using Git for team collaboration development, how to avoid code conflicts and ensure the smooth progress of the development process?
Assistant: 1. Specify the file naming conventions of team members, such as adding the author's name or download time after the file name. 2. Try to let each team member focus on their own tasks, and avoid multiple people modifying the same file or code at the same time. 3. Submit the code in time, keep the latest code version, and avoid the conflict caused by the modification of multiple people. You can use branching, merging, pulling, etc. to coordinate. 4. Before merging the code, conduct a code review to ensure the code quality as much as possible and reduce the occurrence of conflicts. 5. Pay attention to code quality, ensure the standardization and consistency of the code structure, fix errors and defects in the code in a timely manner, and avoid wasting time on unnecessary changes. 6. It is best to adopt some technical solutions to assist the team's collaboration, such as using some automation tools, to get timely feedback and prompts when writing code, and to avoid some basic mistakes. 7. Team members can conduct code reviews on a regular basis to discover problems in code quality in a timely manner, avoiding conflicts in the middle of the process and affecting the development process and efficiency. 8. Choose the correct version control tool. Git is currently the mainstream version control tool. Using Git in the team development process can effectively avoid code conflicts and problems.
