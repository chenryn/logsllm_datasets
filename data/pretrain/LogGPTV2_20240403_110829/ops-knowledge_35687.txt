User: I'm working with a Python script and I have some problems on delaying the execution of a Bash script.
My script.py lets the user choose a script.sh, and after the possibility to modify that, the user can run it with various options. 
One of this option is the possibility to delay of N seconds the execution of the script, I used time.sleep(N) but the script.py totally stops for N seconds, I just want to retard the script.sh of N seconds, letting the user continue using the script.py. 
I searched for answers without success, any ideas?
Assistant: You should run sleep using subprocess.Popen before calling script.sh.
