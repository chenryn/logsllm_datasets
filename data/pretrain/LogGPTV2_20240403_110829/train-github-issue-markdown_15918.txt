`.text-center` and `.text-right` do not apply to table td / th elements, as
the align left rule for those takes precedence.
I've added this as a workaround; an alternative might be to add `!important`
to the `.text-` rules
    .table th, .table td {
      &.text-center { text-align: center; }
      &.text-right { text-align: right; }
    }
