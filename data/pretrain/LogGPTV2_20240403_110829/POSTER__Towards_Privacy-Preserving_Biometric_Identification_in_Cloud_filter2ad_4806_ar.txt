and multiplication provided by the FABB use well-known MPC protocols,
based on the properties of the cryptographic sharing primitive selected. These
categories include the BGW protocol in [17], BDOZ in [18], SPDZ in [58],
MASCOT in [113] and the highly specialized three-party protocols in [13].
Arithmetic Black-Box Extension
Following the work presented by Lipmaa and Toft in [126], we proceed to extend
our black box, in order to have inequality tests for our protocol. Arithmetic
circuits and protocols for secure comparison have been introduced in [44,55],
among others. Inequality tests can be found in [126], where the authors use
the same FABB conceptualization. In the context of our FABB extension, the
following operations are provided:
[z] ← [x] ?= [y] | [z] ∈ {0, 1} .
[z] ← [x] ?
< [y] | [z] ∈ {0, 1} .

3.3 Assumptions
We assume that the embedded biometric sensors are tamper-proof devices.
A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is available in order to establish a secure
channel for the transmission of the newly extracted biometric samples from
the user to the multimodal AaaS system. To protect the privacy of the user
towards the cloud-based providers, the new and stored templates are distributed
in the cloud using a secret sharing key scheme. The reference thresholds ϑi
that determine the unimodal authentication are held and tuned by the cloud-
based UAs and they secretly share them during the execution of the protocol.
Regarding the training procedures and the user-speciﬁc weighted score level
fusion, we assume that UAs hold and calculate the performance rates FARi,
126

CLOUD-BASED IDENTITY PROVIDERS
FRRi and the parameters for the accuracy. We make the assumption that they
carry out the training of the matching algorithms on their unimodal datasets by
regulating the ϑi while they also utilize established techniques to manage the
user-speciﬁc error rates. As mentioned previously, the calculation of these rates
and any related actions on the computing of such metrics are outside the scope
of this paper. Finally, the UAs are considered to be untrusted computational
parties. However, due to their conﬂicting and competing interests, UAs do not
collude.
3.4 Notation
We assume that all inputs and intermediate values are elements of a ﬁnite
ﬁeld bounded by p (Fp), such that x (cid:28) p, for any value x in Fp, in order to
avoid overﬂows. We assume that the underlying cryptographic primitive is secret
sharing. Additionally, we use the notation introduced in [57], where [x] represents
the secretly shared value of x. To express operations provided by the FABB, we
use the inﬁx representation [z] ← [x] + [y]. In reality, the operations (addition,
multiplication gates) are provided by the underlying protocols, as referred to
Section 3.2. Our protocol is as secure as the underlying MPC functionality that
is implemented. Negative numbers are represented in the typical way, where
the lower half of the Fp ﬁeld represents the positives and the other half the
negatives.
Under the FABB model, the complexity is measured by the number of
the non-concurrent black-box operations that are executed. MPC protocols
based on linear secret sharing schemes can oﬀer addition of shares and
scalar multiplication, approximately at the same cost of similar “plaintext”
operations. However, multiplications require information exchange between
the computational parties since common MPC protocols work on linear secret
sharing schemes and the non-linear operations require additional information
that is hold by diﬀerent parties [58].
Concurrent operations that require information exchange between parties is
referred to as a communication round. Comparisons are by themselves arithmetic
circuits, composed of addition and multiplication gates. Their computation and
communication cost is much higher than for a multiplication, and thus is in the
interest of the algorithm designer to minimize their use.

4 Proposed Multimodal Authentication System
This section describes our novel multimodal authentication system using cloud-
based providers. Prior to the detailed description, we ﬁrst give an overview
of the scheme which is depicted in Figure 5. The user requests the login to a
service. The SP wants to authenticate the user based on biometric information.
In our indicative scenario, the SP requires a multimodal authentication result
based on three modalities (face, ﬁngerprint, iris). However, the SP does not
have the authorization, expertise or intention to be involved in the biometric
feature recognition. For that reason, the SP redirects the user to the multimodal
AaaS system. The computing infrastructure involves third parties that operate
as unimodal AaaS providers with their unimodal DBs outsourced to the cloud.
It is assumed that the user has already been enrolled in the remote unimodal
subsystems of these providers to be authenticated for several applications
and services that require unimodal recognition. The architecture includes the
transmission of the user credentials, such as his name, from the SP and the
presence of his fresh biometric samples from the user. According to the purposes
of the service, the preferences and the requirements of the SP, the user’s
biometrics can be submitted locally to the SP’s sensors, or on any other device
with embedded sensors that corresponds to the web application of the SP. The
credentials and the new template of the extracted biometrics are encrypted and
securely transmitted to the multimodal AaaS system. The third parties search
to their cloud-based DBs for the corresponding stored templates and securely
perform unimodal authentication and multimodal fusion. Given the application
and the recommendations of the SP, the AaaS system sets the decision threshold
of the overall authentication procedure, and communicates the output to the
SP. The user learns from the SP whether his access is granted or denied.
4.1 Parties and Roles
For an in-depth examination of the infrastructure and functionality of the
multimodal AaaS system, Figure 6 illustrates the distributed cloud-based
providers and presents the interaction diagram of the parties in our design.
User: This entity wants to access various services provided by the SP and
requests the login to the service. The user may also carry a personal device that
he uses to authenticate himself while he performs the authentication-related
action by presenting his fresh biometric features.
Service Provider: Party that is interested in the authentication of the user.
SP knows and holds the credentials of the user and transmits them to the
multimodal AaaS system. The SP may hold a device with embedded sensors

and request the submission of user’s biometrics locally. The entity does not
actively participate in the computation. It is informed only of the ﬁnal decision
of the multimodal result.
Unimodal Authenticators: These parties operate as unimodal AaaS providers.
They also can be considered as IdMaaS developers that establish the users’
identities and outsource their tools for BaaS purposes. They hold their respective
unimodal templates stored in distinct unimodal DBs and they are in charge of
adjusting the reference thresholds ϑi of their unimodal subsystems. Moreover,
they also use training techniques to manage the FARi(ϑi) and FRRi(ϑi)
parameters in order to select the user-speciﬁc weights wi. We consider the
maintenance of the templates to be an orthogonal problem. If the stored
unimodal templates have to be updated in the DB of each UA, this can be
directly managed by the authorized UAs that can adjust the biometric data
of the user and recalculate the performance metrics, thresholds and weights of
their schemes.
Multimodal Identity Provider: In our system, for clarity purposes this
party is the product of the cooperation of the UAs. It is considered to be an
IdMaaS intermediary provider that is responsible for the communication of the
user and the SP with the cloud-based UAs in the computation environment.
Towards the UAs third parties, MIP performs the tasks of the communication
of the credentials of the user and the secure transmission of the encrypted

authentication system.
new templates that are generated from the sensors after the feature extraction
module. Additionally, the MIP sets the ﬁnal decision threshold τ and securely
communicates the authentication result to the SP.
Input data: All the input data of the parties are considered to be private. In
our privacy-preserving protocol, biometric information is represented in binary
form; the data are measured and converted by the sensor and sent to the MIP
and the UAs computational parties using secure private channels. We assume
that input data are integers that can be represented as elements of the ﬁnite
ﬁeld Fp. For ﬁxed point precision, the data can be multiplied by a suﬃciently
large decimal constant. This procedure takes place to avoid complex decimal
130

CLOUD-BASED IDENTITY PROVIDERS
arithmetic with arithmetic circuits.
Dealers: They have to provide inputs to the protocol for the computation in
a shared form. In our case, the user provides the biometric data extracted by
the sensors. Additionally, MIP receives the new templates and transmits the
secret shares of the new templates to the UAs. The cloud-based UAs receive
the secret shares of the new templates and transmit the secret shares of the
stored templates. Finally, UAs communicate the parametrization.
Computational parties: They are the set of servers in charge of executing the
protocol. They receive the shares from the dealers and execute the computation.
The role of these parties can be executed by the UAs and partly by the MIP
that sets the decision threshold. Note that there is no upper bound on the
number of the involved computational parties.
Output parties: The parties that learn the ﬁnal output. In our case, the SP
and the MIP play this role while no other party, including the UAs, learns any
auxiliary information besides their original inputs.
4.2 Threat Model
The users are considered malicious. A user might actively try to collect and
alter the extracted new templates and/or stored and exchanged information
within the multimodal AaaS system, in an attempt to gain access to the data
or the service which he does not have the permission to access. The SP is an
active adversary. It may try to learn information about the users. We consider
that its aim might be to gain access to the computation environment, collect or
modify the data in an attempt to disrupt and extract conﬁdential information
about users, other competitive SPs and the multimodal AaaS system iteself.
The devices with the embedded biometric sensors can either by owned by the
users or by the SP. In the ﬁrst case, they are trusted (tamper-evident). We
assume that these devices support cryptographic operations and the security
mechanisms in order to provide access control and protection against malware.
In the second case, according to the preferences and requirements of the SP,
if the devices with the biometric sensors are held by the SP, then both the
SP and the devices are considered honest-but-curious entities. The case that
the SP gains access to the fresh biometric features and tries to learn the
private data of the user is not included in the scenario. Within the distributed
domain, the MIP is an honest-but-curious entity. It follows the mutimodal
authentication speciﬁcations and it performs the protocol honestly, but it
might try to collect the exchanged data, learn the calculation results within
the computation environment and extract unauthorized private information
about the users. The UAs are malicious. Although they do not collude due to
PROPOSED MULTIMODAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
131
their competing interests, the data they calculate and forward to the MIP and
consequently to the SP might be corrupted.
4.3 Authentication Phases
Following the interaction diagram of Figure 6, the next phases for the
authentication of the user using our multimodal AaaS system are executed:
1. The SP that wants to authenticate the user requests an identiﬁcation
document or personal credentials.
2. The user transmits this information to the SP.
3. The SP communicates the credentials of the user to the cloud-based MIP.
4. The MIP requests the user to provide his biometric samples. For our scenario,
the authentication is performed on face, ﬁngerprint and iris samples.
5. The user presents his biometrics to the sensors of a device that is best suited
to the operational requirements of the SP and it is compatible with the web
application of the SP. During the feature extraction operation, the acquired
fresh biometrics are securely extracted and their binary representation as
new templates are transmitted to the MIP.
6. The MIP transmits secret shares of these new templates to the remote UAs.
Figure 7 illustrates the authentication modules using a weighted score level
fusion and represents the ﬂowchart that takes place in the cloud. The UAs
receive the secret shares of the encrypted new templates. According to the
given user credentials, they subsequently transmit secret shares of their
relative unimodal stored templates.
For the unimodal matching score generation module, the computation domain
uses the technique of Hamming Distance algorithms to match the biometric
templates. Given the matching score of the user and according to the
conditions of (1), each UA holds the reference threshold ϑi for its unimodal
subsystem and it can compute the user’s performance rates. During the
weights selection operation, based on the results of FAR from Equation
(3), FRR from Equation (4) or the overall accuracy given by Equation (5),
the UAs deﬁne the weights on a user-by-user basis. It is noted that the ϑ
and the performance rates of the user are considered to be private data
and they are not transmitted in the interactive computation environment.
Hence, the technical expertise of each UA for the calculation of weights is
not accessible to the cloud-based parties. Additionally, since the weights are
arithmetic metrics they cannot disclose any sensitive information about the
132

speciﬁc weighted score level fusion.
user’s identity and thus they are public and they are provided by the UAs
to the AaaS system.
In the fusion module, according to our analysis in Section 3.1, the weights
are used to assign diﬀerent degrees of importance to the user’s modalities.
The proposed multimodal AaaS system incorporates the unimodal matching
scores and the weights of the UAs by applying a user-speciﬁc weighted sum
rule, given by Equation (6). Additional details regarding the selection of the
user-speciﬁc weights based on the performance rates for score level fusion
models can be found in [209].
7. The computation environment of the UAs secretly shares the result of the
fusion module to the MIP. According to the purpose of the service application
and the preferences of the SP, the MIP sets the decision threshold τ and
compares the ﬁnal fused score (6) following the conditions of (2). The output
of the decision module is binary represented as 1 that means that the
authentication is accepted, or 0 that corresponds to a failed user recognition.
PROPOSED MULTIMODAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM
133
The user is rejected when the system fails to correspond the new templates
to the stored data in the DBs of the UAs, for instance when the user is not
registered in one or more unimodal subsystems of the UAs and his biometric
data are not stored in the unimodal DBs of these providers. It can also
happen when the matching scores are poor, resulting a ﬁnal fusion score that
failed to surpass the threshold of decision.
8. The MIP communicates the binary output of the decision module to the SP.
9. The SP informs the user for his successful or failed authentication.
4.4 Distributed Calculation of Multimodal Authentication
with MPC
In this section, we give a detailed treatment of our secure distributed protocol for
the biometric authentication mechanism and analyze its complexity, security and
privacy. To facilitate readability, we divide the process into the modules presented
in Figure 7. In the context of the MPC, this is no more than a conceptual
division rather than a tangible task separation. It is important to stress that
they together form a unique and uninterrupted arithmetic circuit, with a single
output point. The protocol does not suﬀer from the typical composability
related security weaknesses presented by Canetti in [42]. Instead, our protocol
is designed following the composable hybrid model for MPC introduced in [41].
To maintain privacy and adhere to the security deﬁnition, the modules are
adapted such that any leakage of information is avoided, commonly referred to
as data-obliviousness [44].
MPC Protocols
1. New template transmission: The MIP receives from the user the fresh
templates. Note that the new templates represent the raw acquired biometrics
and they are of a publicly known ﬁxed size N m for each m ∈ M modality.
They are encrypted either with the public keys of the servers or a distributed
shared key. The MIP transmits the new templates in secret shared form,
using an underlying sharing mechanism, such as the secret sharing scheme
presented in [190], towards the computational parties. These parties could
then learn their bit representation of the inputs as follows: Ti = t1, ..., tN
where tj ∈ {0, 1} for all j ∈ {1, ..., N}, by using mechanisms, such as the
ones outlined in [55].
2. Stored template transmission: The service providers send the binary
