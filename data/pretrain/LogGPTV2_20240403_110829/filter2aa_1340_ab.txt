Bad Guys won’t put in the effort...
What should consumers do then?
Wired > Wireless Cameras
Verify and understand the limitations of the 
products*
Cameras have unintended great uses!
Real Estate
Household / Business Cleaners
Dog Walkers
Etc.
Windows for Consumers
What We Tell Users
• Patch your devices
• Install Anti-virus
• Use HTTPS only
• Use a password manager
• Watch out for suspicious downloads
• Don’t use suspicious wifi
• Pick “strong” passwords*
Let’s talk about the past
• Back at DEF CON 20 Zack gave a talk…
The Old Focus
• Corporate Accounts
• Internal Networks
• Relay Auth
• Mmmmm. Data
NTLM Hashes
• Md4(unicode($password)
• 128 bit hash
• Used for network authentication and 
signing
NTLM Network Authentication
• 3 way Handshake
• Client -> Server: Sup, what do you support
• Server -> Client: We speak klingon, Challenge Code
• Client -> Sever: My voice is my passport, verify me.
• Two Flavors
• V1 – Server Challenge Only
• V2 – Client challenge added to server challenge
• Microsoft has recommended to move away from 
NTLM in favor of Kerberos
• Auto Authentication to Things
WPAD
• DHCP Option
• WPAD from DNS from DHCP 
• LLMNR
• NBNS
• Windows 10 seems to be authing less to 
this, but some applications (LOOKING AT 
YOU CHROME) do.
Not Just WPAD
• This isn’t another “wpad is bad” talk.
• Injection of UNC paths in IE/Edge
• File formats with UNC Paths
• 3rd party applications without CORS
Corporate Internal Only?
THIS IS STILL A HUGE ISSUE
You might see where this is going
Corporate Internal Only?
• We’ve never really talked about impact of 
cracking the NTLM Network Challenges…
• Corporate? VPN Access, Sharepoint, Shared Passwords, 
local admin if permissions are set?
• What about personal users?
• Shared passwords? 
• Local file shares? 
• Provides only guest access remotely and admin.
Now
ZackAttack Update
Release 0.1.2
“for Zacks who can’t code good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too”
Now
So what?
• At a minimum, information disclosure of 
email of the user. That’s bad enough.
• Offline password attacks.
• And if you can crack the password…
Heavy Microsoft User?
• Outlook Emails!
• OneDrive
• Remote File Access
• WiFi Sense
Offline Cracking? That’s 
Original….
• Breaches - both services and local
• Encrypted files / datasets
• Really bad services
• But harvestable from a LAN? And as a 
single signon token?
What We Tell Users
• Patch your devices
• Doesn’t Mater
• Install Anti-virus
• Some HIDS catch 1122334455667788, but that’s it
• Use HTTPS only
• It’s only a matter of time you hit a HTTP endpoint
• Use a password manager
• Still have your Microsoft account, but helps with other sites
• Watch out for suspicious downloads
• Does not apply
• Don’t use suspicious wifi
• Are you going to not use wifi when on the road?
• Pick “strong” passwords
What We Shouldn’t Be Telling 
Users
• Use this cool VPN service! Totally 
Trustworthy!
What We Need To Tell Users
• Pick strong passphrases
• Enable 2-Factor (yes, it’s 10+ steps)
• Use unique creds per site
• Maybe avoid hotmail/outlook mail for a 
bit
How can we fix it?
• Disable NTLM Auth (but what user is going 
to do that)
• Don’t use a Microsoft account to log in 
to your windows system
So TL;DR
• Got a Stock Windows Laptop?
• Attacker on the same network?
• Use a Microsoft Account to log in?
• You’re pwned.
Summary of Issues
• Fitness / Notification Devices can be 
tracked through various means
• WiFi Security Cameras can get blasted 
offline and see/know nothing
• Consumer Windows Laptops leak identity 
and creds for offline cracking
