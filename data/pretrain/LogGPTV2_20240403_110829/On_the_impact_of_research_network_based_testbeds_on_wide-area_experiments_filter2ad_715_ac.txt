tiple nodes. However, the actual paths used in terms of
physical hops are typically diﬀerent for each node even if
they use the same ISP. This is due to their geographical
separation. In addition, even if nodes use the same ISP, the
AS-level path traversed by them to a common destination
may still be diﬀerent based on routing preference.
5.2 The Difference between Flows
in GREN and Commercial Networks
We ﬁrst compare the performance properties of ﬂows in
Case 1 (G2G) and Case 4 (C2C). Despite the fact that
the commercial and GREN networks are physically separate
(and thus diﬀerent), we still wish to measure whether there
exists signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the performance properties of
paths in these networks, enough to impact the evaluation of
applications over the testbed.

5.2.1 RTT
Figure 9 shows the distribution of RTTs that will be ex-
perienced by applications over G2G and C2C paths. The
ﬁrst two ﬁgure depicts the average RTT experienced for a
path along with the standard deviation of RTT observations
recorded for that path. The paths are sorted according to
their RTT. The results show that G2G and C2C RTTs have
diﬀerent characteristics despite similar geographic locations
of the nodes considered. While the maximum average RTT
in G2G can be up to 200ms, the maximum average RTT can
be up to 300ms in C2C. The ﬁgures also show that average
RTTs of individual paths in G2G are slightly lower for most
samples than in C2C. The average RTT of a C2C path was
24.4% higher than that of a G2G path. Also, while 37% of
the RTTs in G2G paths were more than 100ms, 50% of the
RTTs on C2C paths were more than 100ms. C2C RTTs are
also more unstable. While only 2 paths in G2G exhibit high
variance, approximately 21 paths in C2C had high variance.
The last ﬁgure also depicts the minimum RTT recorded for
G2G and C2C paths. As expected these distributions are
similar since they tend to reﬂect the real distance between
nodes and we chose these nodes in similar locations. How-
ever, the dynamic variations of RTT is larger on C2C paths
than on G2G paths.
In conclusion, the RTTs experienced under Case 4 can be
diﬀerent (typically higher average and variance) from that
experienced under Case 1. These increases are likely due to
path inﬂation from routing policies [23] of commercial ISPs.
5.2.2 Path Loss
Path loss is an important property that aﬀects the through-
put achieved by TCP-friendly application ﬂows that are
commonly used by several applications ranging from appli-
cation layer multicast, DHTs and data dissemination sys-
tems.
The tulip tool [10] was used to measure loss rates for
the G2G and C2C paths and the resulting loss rate distri-
butions are shown in Figure 10. These results show that
while the loss rate is close to 0 for 58% of G2G paths, it
is close to 0 for 45% of C2C paths. The average loss rate
for G2G paths was 0.059 while the loss rate for C2C paths
was 0.078. In summary, we believe that overall G2G paths
exhibit lower losses than C2C paths. Commercial networks
carry more traﬃc and this could be one of the reasons for
this observation.
5.2.3 Available Bandwidth and Capacity
Many high throughput demanding applications such as
those in data dissemination can vary in performance de-
pending on the available bandwidth and capacity available

Figure 10: Path loss rates measured for G2G and C2C paths.
on Internet paths. Figure 11 shows the average and standard
deviation of the available bandwidth between the pairs of
nodes in Case 1 and Case 4 found using the Spruce tool. The
results show that the average available bandwidth on G2G
paths are signiﬁcantly higher than those on C2C paths. For
example, the maximum average available bandwidth mea-
sured on a C2C path was 50,000 Kbps while more than
80% of the G2G paths had more than 50,000 Kbps avail-
able bandwidth on average. Overall, the average available
bandwidth was 600% higher on G2G paths than that on
C2C paths. Additionally, while 95% of G2G paths had an
available bandwidth greater than 10Mbps, only 37% of C2C
paths had available bandwidth more than 10Mbps.
Similar trends were seen when measuring the capacity of
G2G versus C2C paths. Figure 11 also shows the capacity
between the pairs of nodes in Case 1 and Case 4 measured
using the pathrate tool. The results show that C2C paths
have signiﬁcantly lower capacity than G2G paths. Overall,
the average capacity on G2G paths was 532% higher than
that on C2C paths. Additionally, while 95% of G2G paths
had capacity greater than 50Mbps, only 25% of C2C paths
had available bandwidth more than 10Mbps.
5.2.4 Bottleneck Location
To investigate whether Case 4 (C2C) paths having lower
capacity and available bandwidth than Case 1 (G2G) paths
is an artifact of the commercial nodes having lower access
bandwidth or a general observation about the commercial
network paths, we used the pathneck tool to locate bottle-
necks on all 110 C2C paths.
Table 2 shows the top 3 choke points and their conﬁdence
levels as reported by pathneck as well as whether the choke
point resides in the network (I) or at the access link A. The
results show that for 64.8% of the paths considered, the main
choke-point (CP1) lies in the network rather than the access
link and overall 66.4% of the paths have at least one of the
top three chokepoints in the network. Thus the previous
results about capacity and available bandwidth are primar-
ily because Case 4 paths have lower capacity and available
bandwidth than Case 1 paths and that a majority of the
bottlenecks are in the core of the network.
5.2.5 Throughput
Finally, we measure the actual TCP throughput achieved
over all 110 G2G and all 110 C2C paths to compare the ﬁnal
impact all network properties can collectively have on ap-
plication throughput. Figure 12 shows the TCP throughput
between the pairs of nodes in Case 1 and Case 4 measured
using Iperf. Again we ﬁnd that C2C paths on average have
lower throughput than G2G paths. Note that while the G2G
paths have large available bandwidth and capacity, the ob-
tained TCP throughputs are lower in scale since the actual
connections may have large RTTs, path losses may occur
or the PlanetLab node may be overloaded; all of which can
reduce the ﬁnal TCP throughput achieved. However, the
important fact is that the TCP throughputs achieved are
higher than on C2C paths. Overall, the average through-
put obtained on G2G paths was 127% higher than that on
C2C paths. Additionally, while 70% of G2G paths had a
throughput greater than 1500 Kbps, only 30% of C2C paths
had a throughput greater than 1500 Kbps.
5.3 Representativeness of Case 2 and Case 3
The previous section showed that Case 1 and Case 4 paths
are very diﬀerent from each other in performance properties,
and hence the use of G2G paths for evaluating application
performance can make results less representative. It remains
to be seen whether we can still leverage the nodes belong-
ing to G to perform experiments and this depends on how
representative Case 2 and Case 3 paths are. Thus, in this
section, we measure the representativeness of Case 2 and
Case 3 traﬃc.
The results are shown in Figure 13. The ﬁgure compares
performance properties for all 110 C2C, G2G, C2G and G2C
paths. Figure 13(a) shows the RTT for all four types of
paths. The curves show that C2G and G2C RTTs are similar
in nature to each other and to C2C except in a few cases
and are slightly higher than G2G RTTs for a majority of
paths. More importantly, Figures 13(d),13(e) show that the
available bandwidth and capacity on C2G, G2C and C2C
paths are similar to each other and all lower than those of
G2G paths. One anomaly seen is that in Figure 13(d) some
of the G2C paths have higher available bandwidth than the
