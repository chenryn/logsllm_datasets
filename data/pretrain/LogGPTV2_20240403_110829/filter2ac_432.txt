### Title: Veni, No Vidi, No Vici: Attacks on ETW-Blind EDR Sensors in the EU-21

Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a built-in feature originally designed for software diagnostics. Today, it is essential for Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. ETW is deeply integrated into the Windows kernel and is involved in numerous API calls to trace OS events. Many EDRs, business, and academic projects rely on ETW functions to respond to security threats. However, ETW is vulnerable to attacks that can disable it, rendering EDRs ineffective.

In this analysis, we will examine existing attacks on ETW and uncover some of its internal workings, including data structures and kernel API routines. We will also demonstrate two new attacks that can blind ETW-based EDRs without triggering any OS security features, such as Kernel Patch Protection (KPP). A newly released tool, Binarly Sensor, can detect both attacks, while an updated version of MemoryRanger can prevent only the second one.

#### First Attack: NT Kernel Logger Session
The first attack targets the NT Kernel Logger Session, which is used by Process Monitor to collect network events. To blind Process Monitor, we use an application to illegally stop a running NT Kernel Logger Session. Similar attacks can be performed on other logger sessions, such as the Circular Kernel Context Logger.

#### Second Attack: ETW Logger Sessions Used by Windows Defender
The second attack focuses on ETW Logger sessions used by Windows Defender. This attack involves patching ETW data structures. We will demonstrate a kernel driver that queries information and stops ETW Logger sessions, thereby disabling defense mechanisms.

#### Detection and Prevention
Binarly Sensor, a new protection tool, can detect both types of attacks. It uses a kernel driver to extract information about critical OS data and code, enabling it to reveal various attacks on the Windows kernel. While Binarly Sensor can detect both attacks, the updated MemoryRanger can only prevent the second one.

These attacks affect all versions of Windows from Vista to 11, highlighting the importance of addressing these vulnerabilities in the design of ETW's core features.
