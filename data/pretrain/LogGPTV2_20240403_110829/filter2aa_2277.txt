Who are we?
Who is Paparazzi?
Micro unmanned aerial vehicle framework
http://paparazzi.enac.fr
Why do I care?
We're not going to preach the advantages of 
autonomous or RC vehicles - you know this 
already.
Paparazzi:
- Innovative
- Competitive
- Hugely flexible
"Many start Paparazzi as UAV hobbyists and 
leave as professionals!"
