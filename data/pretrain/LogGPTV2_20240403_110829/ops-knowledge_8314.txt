User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Sync non-AD LDAP instance with Office365 / Azure AD We have a non-AD LDAP environment that we wish to sync with our o365 Azure AD directory.

Is this currently possible with DirSync, AAD Sync or similar?

Assistant: (answering my own question)

It now seems like Microsoft has officially launched (in preview) an Azure AD Domain Services solution. This should theoretically allow third party directories to sync (over LDAP) with Azure Active directory to allow O365 credentials to log in to local applications that use that 3rd party directory.
