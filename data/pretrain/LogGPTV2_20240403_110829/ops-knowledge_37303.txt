User: As far as I can tell Tornado is a server and a framework in one. It seems to me that using Flask and Tornado together is like adding another abstraction layer (more overhead). Why do people use Flask and Tornado together, what are the advantages?
Assistant: instead of using Apache as your server, you'll use Tornado (of course as blocking server due to the synchronous nature of WSGI).
