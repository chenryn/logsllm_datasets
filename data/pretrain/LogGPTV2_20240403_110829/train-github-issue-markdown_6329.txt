I was testing different methods trying to grasp the objective. When I decided
run my next solution, I got a bunch of code right under the "run bar". What
you see here is only just a part of it. It's fairly long.  
I have had a few problems with some of my challenges were not getting
validated until the next day when I logged back in. I still have one level
that won't pass, unless I'm' missing something simple.
