We need a configurer that resolves placeholder as application's environment
entries.
Our application is deployed on different environments (development,
integration, production) and even in production we have the same application
deployed many times.
We must build different web archives just to change few properties (mail
server, reporting server, etc.).
In a J2EE application, such properties should be configured in application's
environment entries (JNDI).
I'll attached a proposal for an EnvironmentEntryPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.
