We require a configurer that can resolve placeholders using the application's environment entries. Our application is deployed across multiple environments, including development, integration, and production. Even within the production environment, the same application is deployed multiple times. Currently, we have to build different web archives just to modify a few properties (e.g., mail server, reporting server, etc.).

In a J2EE application, these properties should be configured via the application's environment entries (JNDI). I am attaching a proposal for an `EnvironmentEntryPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` to address this issue.
