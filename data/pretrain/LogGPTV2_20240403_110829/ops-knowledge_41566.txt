User: Please explain what is load balancing, list several commonly used load balancing algorithms, and briefly introduce their characteristics.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technical means to provide high availability and scalability by distributing network traffic to multiple servers. Through load balancing, user requests can be distributed to multiple servers, thereby reducing the load on a single server and improving server availability and performance. Commonly used load balancing algorithms include: 1. Round robin algorithm: assign requests to different servers in sequence according to server priority. Applies to situations where the server performance is similar. 2. Minimum number of connections algorithm: Allocate requests to the server with the least number of connections to make the load more balanced. It is suitable for situations where the server performance is uneven or the difference between servers is large. 3. Least Processor Algorithm: Allocate requests to the server with the lightest processor load. It is suitable for situations where the performance of the server processor does not change much, but the network bandwidth and I/O performance vary greatly. 4. IP hash algorithm: hash the server according to the client's IP address to ensure that all requests from the same client are assigned to the same server, avoiding the problem of data inconsistency. The choice of load balancing algorithm depends on specific application scenarios and requirements. Generally speaking, the polling algorithm is suitable for situations where load balancing is relatively simple, while the algorithm for the minimum number of connections and the algorithm for the least number of processors are more suitable for situations with high load and high concurrency.
