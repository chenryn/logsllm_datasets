User: There is an existing MySQL database, and the data in one of the tables needs to be archived according to time to reduce query time. Please provide a simple file scheme.
Assistant: You can use MySQL's partition function to implement archiving. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Create a new archiving table with the same structure as the original table, but do not set any primary keys and indexes. 2. Add a new field of date and time type in the original table for partitioning (for example, take each month as a partition). 3. Set partition rules on the original table, such as partitioning by date: ALTER TABLE original_tbl PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(date_column) ( PARTITION p201501 VALUES LESS THAN ('2015-02-01'), PARTITION p201502 VALUES LESS THAN ('2015 -03-01'), PARTITION p201503 VALUES LESS THAN ('2015-04-01'), ... ); 4. Regularly import old data into the archive table, you can use the INSERT INTO SELECT statement, for example, January 2015 Import the data into the archive table: INSERT INTO archive_tbl SELECT * FROM original_tbl WHERE date_column >= '2015-01-01' AND date_column < '2015-02-01'; 5. To clear old data regularly, you can use the DELETE statement, such as clearing 2015 Data in January: DELETE FROM original_tbl WHERE date_column >= '2015-01-01' AND date_column < '2015-02-01'; 6. When querying data, first determine whether the query condition involves the data to be archived, if If yes, the archived table and the original table are queried at the same time, and the results are combined. For example, to query the data in January 2015: SELECT * FROM original_tbl WHERE date_column >= '2015-01-01' AND date_column < '2015-02-01' UNION ALL SELECT * FROM archive_tbl WHERE date_column >= '2015-01-01 ' AND date_column < '2015-02-01'; Through the above steps, the function of archiving the data of a certain table in the MySQL database according to time can be realized to reduce the query time.
