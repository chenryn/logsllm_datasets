### Issue: Removing Null Padding from UDP Packets Sent from a Linux Computer

**Problem Description:**
I am attempting to remove null padding from UDP packets sent from a Linux computer. Currently, the system pads the packet size to 60 bytes. I am using a raw socket with `AF_PACKET` and `SOCK_RAW` to construct the Ethernet frame header, IP header (where I specify a packet size of less than 60 bytes), and the UDP packet itself. When I send the packets over a local network, Wireshark shows that the packets have null padding.

**Current Setup:**
- **Socket Type:** Raw socket (`AF_PACKET`, `SOCK_RAW`)
- **Packet Construction:**
  - Ethernet Frame Header
  - IP Header (with specified packet size < 60 bytes)
  - UDP Packet

**Observed Behavior:**
- Packets are padded to 60 bytes, as observed in Wireshark.

**Question:**
How can I remove this null padding from the UDP packets?

**Response:**

Unfortunately, removing null padding from UDP packets at the application level is challenging because it is often handled by the network driver. However, you can check and potentially modify the driver settings to disable this behavior.

**Steps to Check and Modify Driver Settings:**

1. **Check if Pad Short Packets is Enabled:**
   Use the `ethtool` command to check if your network interface's driver has the "pad short packets" feature enabled.

   ```sh
   sudo ethtool -d eth0
   ```

   This command will display the current driver settings for the `eth0` interface. Look for the `pad-short-frames` or similar setting.

2. **Disable Pad Short Packets (if supported):**
   If the driver supports disabling the pad short packets feature, you can use the following command:

   ```sh
   sudo ethtool -K eth0 tx off
   ```

   Note: The exact option may vary depending on the driver. Some drivers might not support disabling this feature.

3. **Verify the Change:**
   After making the change, verify that the setting has been updated:

   ```sh
   sudo ethtool -k eth0
   ```

   Ensure that the `tx` or `pad-short-frames` setting is now disabled.

4. **Test the Configuration:**
   Send the UDP packets again and use Wireshark to verify that the null padding is no longer present.

**Additional Notes:**
- Modifying driver settings can affect network performance and stability. Ensure that you understand the implications before making changes.
- If the driver does not support disabling the pad short packets feature, you may need to consider alternative approaches, such as using a different network interface or modifying the driver source code.

This approach should guide you in the right direction to resolve the issue.
