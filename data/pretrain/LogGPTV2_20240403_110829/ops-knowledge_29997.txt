User: I have a python web-application running inside the Google App Engine.
The application creates on user-demand a string and I want the string to be send to the browser client (application/octet-stream?) as a file.
How can i realize this?
Assistant: Setting a content-disposition: attachment header will cause most browsers to download whatever you send them as a file. Safari sometimes ignores it.
