User: According to the following requirements, a CI/CD-based continuous delivery solution is provided, including automation of version control, build, test, and deployment stages. 1. Use Git as a code warehouse management tool\n2. Use Jenkins as a continuous integration and continuous delivery tool\n3. Use Docker as a containerization technology\n4. Use Ansible for automated deployment
Assistant: Solution overview: In this solution, Git will be used for code management, Jenkins will be used as a CI/CD tool for continuous integration and continuous delivery, Docker will be used for application containerization, and Ansible will be used for automated deployment. The scenario will be divided into the following phases: version control, build, test, package, deploy. 1. In the version control stage, Git is used for version control. Team members develop their own functions on the local branch, and push the code to the central code warehouse, and then merge and resolve conflicts. 2. In the construction phase, use Jenkins for continuous integration and automatically compile the code. At this stage, many build parameters can be defined, such as source code paths, build parameters, build tools, compile commands, etc. 3. In the testing phase, after the construction is completed, the code is automatically pushed to the Docker warehouse for construction, and unit tests and integration tests are run. At this stage, post-build test scripts and environment variables can be defined. 4. In the packaging stage, after the test is passed, the application is packaged into a Docker image and pushed to the Docker warehouse. At this stage, you can define environment variables and target Docker warehouses in the packaging process, etc. 5. In the deployment phase, after the Docker image is successfully packaged, use Ansible for automated deployment. At this stage, we can define the application's tags and target servers, etc. The whole process is as follows: ![CI/CD flow chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huang-sinong/nlp-emotion-classification/main/CI-CD_1.png) Summary: Advantages of using this scheme It lies in the ability to effectively manage and version control code, discover and solve problems as early as possible, automate construction and testing, automate code deployment and manage containers. This helps to improve the efficiency and quality of software development, shorten the software development and release cycle, and reduce the operation and maintenance costs of applications.
