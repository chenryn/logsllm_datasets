– The Science
– The Experiments
The Science:
• This is your brain on taste
• Tastes Like Chicken
• Commercially Prepared foods DOS your 
brain.
• You are what you eat, literally!
The Experiments:
• How to taste Chocolate
• Chocolate & Wine
• Why the fuss over a Vinegar?
• Miracle Fruit
Banyuls
What the Experts say:
Banyuls is a grenache-based fortified wine that has been made 
since the thirteenth century. It was then that a physician and 
alchemist named Arnaud de Villeneuve discovered the method of 
mutage, when he figured out that the fermentation of wine could be halted by 
adding pure grape spirit to it, thereby leaving it sweet. Banyuls is allowed to 
ferment until it has about six percent alcohol, then spirit is added, raising the 
alcohol level to about fifteen percent. …a sweet wine that is a classic 
companion to semi-sweet or dark chocolate. While rich and full-bodied, it is less 
sweet and syrupy than a typical dessert wine. It possesses a lovely garnet color 
and a good balanced acidity that makes it come off as more delicate than 
vintage port.
What I say:  Meh!  ---
That is, until you pair it with Chocolate…
How to taste Chocolate
• Use your Eyes
• Touch it
• Use your Ears
• Smell It
• Now Put it on your tongue - It must melt, to be 
tasted.
The steps to tasting anything  
(especially chocolate):
• 1. Put a tiny piece in your mouth, allow it to melt
• 2. Concentrate on mouth feel and change of flavors over 
time
• 3. Look for flavor notes: Do they change, are they 
combined or separate, how intense are they?
• 4. Do you feel bitterness, acid, astringency?  Mild or 
harsh?
• 5. See if you recognize all 3 tasting phases : 
–
A. What you feel at first
–
B.  What you feel as it melts
–
C.  “The end of the mouth”  -- what you feel as you swallow.
6. How do you rate it out of 10?
When is a vinegar not a 
vinegar?
•
Balsamic vinegar is a thick, sweet vinegar made from the pure 
and unfermented juice of grape called the "must." 
•
native to Modena, Italy 
•
True, gourmet balsamic vinegar is slowly aged in wooden 
barrels. 
•
The process of making balsamic vinegar begins by boiling the 
grape juice until it becomes a thick syrup. It is then transferred to 
the wooden barrels to start the aging process. 
•
This can take from 6 months to several years. 
•
The balsamic vinegars sold in your average grocery store are 
probably only aged for a few months in stainless steel tanks
Miracle Fruit
• The science:
•
Large glycoprotein chain 
called Miraculin. was so 
large it was hard to find. 
•
Miraculin binds to the taste 
buds and is activated by 
acidic/bitter foods, releasing 
sugars onto your taste buds.  
•
Sour becomes sweet.
• The Experiments:
• Dissolve on your tongue 
coat the whole thing!
• Taste stuff.
• Effects last for ~60min.
Ready to Experiment?
• For best effect try them in this order:
– Banyuls & Venezuelan Chocolate  -first 
taste the wine, then allow the chocolate to 
melt on the tongue, then taste the wine 
again.
– Identify the 5 Michel Cluizel Plantations
– Taste the balsamic vinegar
– Miracle fruit - (allow it to dissolve and coat 
the tongue) now try *anything* from the 
samples.
