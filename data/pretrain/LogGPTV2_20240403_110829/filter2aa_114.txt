### The Experiments

**How to Taste Chocolate:**
1. **Visual Inspection:** Look at the color and texture.
2. **Touch It:** Feel the texture and temperature.
3. **Listen to It:** Listen for the snap when you break it.
4. **Smell It:** Inhale the aroma.
5. **Taste It:** Place a small piece on your tongue and let it melt.

**Steps to Tasting Anything (Especially Chocolate):**
1. **Put a Tiny Piece in Your Mouth:** Allow it to melt.
2. **Concentrate on Mouthfeel and Flavor Changes:** Notice how the flavors evolve over time.
3. **Identify Flavor Notes:** Are the flavors combined or separate? How intense are they?
4. **Evaluate Sensations:** Do you feel bitterness, acidity, or astringency? Are they mild or harsh?
5. **Recognize the Three Tasting Phases:**
   - **Initial Impression:** What you feel at first.
   - **Melt Phase:** What you feel as it melts.
   - **End of the Mouth:** What you feel as you swallow.
6. **Rate It:** On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate it?

**Banyuls:**
- **Expert Opinion:**
  - Banyuls is a grenache-based fortified wine that has been made since the 13th century. Arnaud de Villeneuve, a physician and alchemist, discovered the method of mutage, which involves halting fermentation by adding pure grape spirit, resulting in a sweet wine. Banyuls is allowed to ferment until it reaches about six percent alcohol, then spirit is added, raising the alcohol level to about fifteen percent. This sweet wine is a classic companion to semi-sweet or dark chocolate. While rich and full-bodied, it is less sweet and syrupy than a typical dessert wine, with a lovely garnet color and balanced acidity that makes it more delicate than vintage port.
- **Personal Opinion:**
  - Meh! But pairing it with chocolate changes everything.

**When is a Vinegar Not a Vinegar?**
- **Balsamic Vinegar:**
  - Made from the unfermented juice of grapes called "must."
  - Native to Modena, Italy.
  - True, gourmet balsamic vinegar is aged in wooden barrels, a process that can take from 6 months to several years.
  - Store-bought balsamic vinegars are often aged for only a few months in stainless steel tanks.

**Miracle Fruit:**
- **The Science:**
  - Miraculin, a large glycoprotein chain, binds to the taste buds and is activated by acidic or bitter foods, releasing sugars onto the taste buds, making sour foods taste sweet.
- **The Experiments:**
  - Dissolve the miracle fruit on your tongue to coat it.
  - Taste various foods and observe the effects, which last for about 60 minutes.
