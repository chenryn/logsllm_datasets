queried H oracle with the values Z∗
3 = uV = vU . From
the value, F can directly output CDH(U, V ) = Z∗
3 . This
contradicts the CDH assumption.
The success probability of F in this case is
P r[F ] ≥
2
s(k)2t(k)
p4(k)
(6)
where p4(k) is the probability of the event that CASE 1.2.2
occurs and the adversary M succeeds in this case. t(k) is the
polynomial bound on the number of distinct H calls made
by the adversary M .
For CASE 1.2.3 and CASE 1.2.4, the simulation of A and
B is similar to that of CASE 1.1.1. The details are omitted.
Together with (3), (4) and (5), the success probability of
S is
P r[S] ≥ maxi=1,2,3,5,6{
s(k)n(k)2t(k) pi(k)}
1
where p5(k), p6(k) are deﬁned in CASE 1.2.3 and CASE 1.2.4
respectively.
The success probability of F is
P r[F ] ≥
2
s(k)2t(k)
p4(k)
(7)
where p4(k) are deﬁned in (6).
If the adversary M succeeds with non-negligible probabil-
ity in any case above, we can also solve the BDH or CDH
problem with non-negligible probability, which contradicts
the assumed security of BDH, CDH problem. In addition,
note that the BDH problem can be reduced to CDH prob-
lem. So we can conclude that our scheme is based its security
on BDH problem.
6. PROTOCOL COMPARISON
The Table 1 shows the comparison between ID-based two-
party AKE protocols in terms of eﬃciency, security model
and underlying hardness assumptions. We do not take into
account subgroup validation and oﬀ-line computation that
may be applicable.
We use the following symbols to explain the computa-
tional performance of each scheme. For simplicity, we just
consider expensive operations:
• P: pairing.
• E: exponentiation in G.
• T: exponentiation in GT .
• Enc: the encryption algorithm of KEM.
• Dec: the corresponding decryption algorithm of KEM.
We denote by ECK the enhanced Chen-Kudla protocol [8],
by EMB the enhanced McCullagh-Barreto protocol [8]. We
also denote by MBDH the modiﬁed bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman,
on which protocol 2 of paper [12] is based. The notation
(cid:96)-BCAA1 means bilinear collision attack assumption, on
which EMB scheme is based.
As stated in the introduction, both protocol 1 and pro-
tocol 2 from [12] do not support the adversary’s Ephemer-
alKeyReveal queries to those sessions owned by the peer of
Test session, so both protocols do not achieve requirements
of CK model (the CK model allows adversaries to make
EphemeralKeyReveal queries to all session except for Test
session and its matching session). We denote by CK∗ their
security model below. BR denotes the Bellare-Rogaway
model [2], where no EphemeralKeyReveal queries are al-
lowed. Also, note that neither BR nor CK∗ models cover
KGC-fs, while our eCK model covers it. KCI denotes se-
curity against key-compromise impersonation. KGC-fs de-
notes KGC forward security.
As shown in Table 1, compared with CK and Smart schemes,
our scheme has advantages over them both in the hardness
assumption and the security model. While SCK-1 and SYL
schemes base security on BDH assumption as well, the eCK
model of our scheme is stronger than theirs BR model which
does not support EphemeralKeyReveal queries at all.
Compared with ECK and EMB, our scheme has advan-
tages both in eﬃciency and the security model. Also, com-
pared with Wang05, the assumption of our scheme is more
standard and the model is stronger. Compared with CC071,
CC072, our eCK model better supports EphemeralKeyRe-
veal queries than their CK∗ model, which is even weaker
than CK model.
Finally, the comparison between Boyd et al.’s protocol and
ours is a bit complicated. Since their protocol is generic, it
can be instantiated using any combination of KEM as long as
they are CCA secure. If the underlying KEM is instantiated
using any KEM scheme in standard model, obviously, our
protocol in random oracle is more eﬃcient. On the other
hand, if the underlying KEM is instantiated using any KEM
scheme in random oracle, e.g. Boneh-Franklin encryption
scheme [4], which is CCA-secure under BDH assumption,
the operations of 1Enc+1Dec+2E need (1P+2E)+(1P+1E)
+2E=2P+5E totally while our scheme needs operations of
2P+3E.
7. CONCLUSIONS
It is well known that the ID-based authenticated key ex-
change is surprisingly diﬃcult to design and prove. The
main issue is that without corresponding static private key,
it is diﬃcult for the simulator to deal with SessionKeyReveal
and EphemeralKeyReveal queries. One usual approach is to
rely security proof on GBDH assumption, which is used to
keep the consistency of random oracle queries.
In this paper, based on the trapdoor test technique we
present a new provably secure ID-based AKE protocol whose
security relies on BDH instead of GBDH assumption. More-
over, Our scheme is proven secure in eCK model, which bet-
ter supports SessionKeyReveal and EphemeralKeyReveal queries.
To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the ﬁrst ID-
based AKE protocol provably secure in the eCK model.
Compared to previous ID-based AKE protocols based on
gap assumption, our proposal has a more standard assump-
tion, i.e. BDH assumption. On the other hand, compared
to other ID-based AKE protocols without gap assumption,
our proposal has advantages over them either in eﬃciency
or in security model.
1The assumption of this protocol depends on that of under-
lying KEM.
