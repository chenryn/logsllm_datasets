### Permission Decisions and Data Collection

#### Existing Datasets
Several datasets on permission decisions have been published, including [8] and [30]. Other datasets, such as [2] and [10], include runtime decisions but were collected in non-realistic scenarios. Initially, we considered using the dataset from Wijesekera et al. [2], as it appeared to meet our requirements. However, this dataset was deemed unsuitable for our goals because:

- Participants' decisions were collected offline during an exit interview, which means the context at request time differs from the decision time.
- The number of decisions per participant (10-15) is insufficient for training a machine learning model.

#### Our Data Collection Campaign
To address these limitations, we decided to conduct our own data collection campaign using a partial implementation of SmarPer. This approach allowed us to build a dataset that better aligns with our objectives. Key challenges in our data collection included:

- Gathering sufficient data for machine learning analysis within a limited timeframe.
- Avoiding overwhelming users with frequent prompts or causing prompt habituation.
- Dealing with the sparsity of data due to the variety of apps, permissions, and contextual information.

To mitigate these challenges, we selected a subset of popular apps from the US Google Play Store, focusing on those that request access to location, contacts, and storage. By choosing popular apps, we increased the likelihood of:

- Collecting more decision data from each app.
- Having multiple participants use the same app, thus generating more diverse data.

#### Features Collected
We selected 32 raw features for our machine learning analysis, categorized as follows:

- **App Information (6)**: UID, GID, package name, name, version, and Google Play Store category.
- **Foreground App Information (3)**: Package name, name, and activity.
- **Request Information (4)**: XPrivacy category, method name, parameters, and whether it is dangerous (denying it may break the app).
- **Decision Information (4)**: Type, current time, time to make the decision, and whether the decision has been modified by the user.
- **Device Status (14)**: Screen in interactive mode, screen locked, ringer state, headphones plugged, headphone type, headphones with a mic, battery percent, charging state, charger type, network connection type, dock state, latitude, longitude, and location provider.
- **Semantic Location (1)**: Users are asked to choose a label for their current geographical location (e.g., home, work, public, other).

#### Data Collection Considerations
Our current SmarPer implementation aims to collect users' permission decisions at runtime. To avoid overwhelming users and ensure reliable data, we implemented the following mechanisms:

- **Prompt Rate-Limiting**: We do not limit the number of prompts if the user is actively using the app. For background apps, we apply rate-limiting policies to prevent excessive prompts.

#### Methodology
1. **Recruitment**:
   - Participants were recruited through online forums and campus flyers.
   - Requirements: At least 18 years old, regular Android users, and regular users of at least two of the selected apps.
   - Incentive: $50 gift card.

2. **Setup, Training, and Entry Survey**:
   - Participants had access to training materials and completed an entry survey.
   - Remote participants used their personal devices, while local participants could use provided smartphones.
   - We explained the functioning of SmarPer and its privacy-preserving features.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - Participants ran SmarPer on their devices for at least 10 days.
   - Goal: Collect at least 75 decisions per participant.
   - Data was uploaded daily over an encrypted connection.

4. **Static Policies and Exit Surveys**:
   - At the end of the study, participants defined static permission settings and completed an exit survey.
   - Supplementary interviews were conducted to understand decision-making processes.

5. **Data Quality**:
   - Checks were performed to validate the quality of the data.
   - Inconsistent or rapid responses were flagged, and noisy data was removed.

#### Data Set Details
- **Participants**: 47 joined, 41 completed.
- **Data Collected**: 4.82 million app requests, 8,521 manual permission decisions.
- **Demographics**: 41% female, 71% aged 18-25, 29% aged 26-50, mostly students and professionals.
- **Exploratory Analysis**:
  - Decision types: 42% allow, 27% obfuscate, 31% deny.
  - Participants were more likely to allow contacts and deny location requests, contradicting their reported privacy concerns.
  - Some participants were more active than others, leading to variations in the number of decisions and decision types.

These results highlight the unique privacy preferences of each user and the complexity of predicting permission decisions.
