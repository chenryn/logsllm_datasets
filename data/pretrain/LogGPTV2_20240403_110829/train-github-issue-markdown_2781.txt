This behavior seems very weird to me.
If I run test.ts with
    deno run test.ts --allow-net
I get the following error
    error: Uncaught PermissionDenied: network access to "http://127.0.0.1:3333/", run again with the --allow-net flag
        at unwrapResponse (rt/10_dispatch_json.js:24:13)
        at sendAsync (rt/10_dispatch_json.js:75:12)
        at async fetch (rt/26_fetch.js:279:29)
However, this works if I run it like this
    deno run --allow-net test.ts
Everything works fine.
I feel like most users expect the same behavior from both examples.
