User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MSSQL Server 10 runaway log growth, 100GB/week I have started as an IT Manager and my remit covers MSSQL server. A database that I have inherited uses around 100GB of HD in the space of a week, in the LDF file. This in turn uses all available disk space on drive C: and the server falls over. 

Can I therefore use the Restricted File Growth option on the LDF file to stop it using the entire drive? If so, what happens when this file is full?

Also, what would be causing this type of activity? Would this be due to a poorly written SQL query?

Assistant: Check whether the DBs are in Full Recovery mode.  If they are, have you got jobs running to actually back up the transaction logs running on a frequent enough schedule to keep them to a manageable size? 

Edit:

When the file is full due to restricted growth your DB will stop processing transactions as it has nowhere to log them.  You need to sort out the reason for the file growing so much rather than restricting the file.
