ABSTRACT
Voice access technologies are widely adopted in mobile de-
vices and voice assistant systems as a convenient way of user
interaction. Recent studies have demonstrated a potentially
serious vulnerability of the existing voice interfaces on these
systems to “hidden voice commands”. This attack uses syn-
thetically rendered adversarial sounds embedded within a
voice command to trick the speech recognition process into
executing malicious commands, without being noticed by
legitimate users.
In this paper, we employ low-cost motion sensors, in a
novel way, to detect these hidden voice commands. In partic-
ular, our proposed system extracts and examines the unique
audio signatures of the issued voice commands in the vi-
bration domain. We show that such signatures of normal
commands vs. synthetic hidden voice commands are distinc-
tive, leading to the detection of the attacks. The proposed
system, which benefits from a speaker-motion sensor setup,
can be easily deployed on smartphones by reusing existing
on-board motion sensors or utilizing a cloud service that pro-
vides the relevant setup environment. The system is based
on the premise that while the crafted audio features of the
hidden voice commands may fool an authentication system

in the audio domain, their unique audio-induced surface vi-
brations captured by the motion sensor are hard to forge. Our
proposed system creates a harder challenge for the attacker
as now it has to forge the acoustic features in both the audio
and vibration domains, simultaneously. We extract the time
and frequency domain statistical features, and the acoustic
features (e.g., chroma vectors and MFCCs) from the motion
sensor data and use learning-based methods for uniquely
determining both normal commands and hidden voice com-
mands. The results show that our system can detect hidden
voice commands vs. normal commands with 99.9% accuracy
by simply using the low-cost motion sensors that have very
low sampling frequencies.

1 INTRODUCTION
Voice controllable systems (VCS) have become increasingly
popular in recent years. They provide a convenient way of
meeting a user’s various daily needs through voice com-
mands and taking actions when necessary, such as access
control, personal schedule/memo inquiry, smart home appli-
ance control, online purchases, etc. Due to their convenience,
these systems have already been integrated into various plat-
forms including mobile phones (e.g., Siri and Google Now),
stand-alone assistants (e.g., Amazon Echo Dot, Google Home
and HomePod), and even smart appliances (e.g., smart TVs
and smart refrigerators). A market research report suggests
that the global voice assistant market is expected to grow at
approximately $7.8 billion by 2023, at 39.27% of Compound
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) between 2017 and 2023 [3].
With the ever-growing deployment, the VCSs’ security vul-
nerabilities become an increasing public concern.
Due to the open propagation properties of sound, voice
commands as an input solution have some fundamental
vulnerabilities. An emerging class of potentially devastat-
ing attacks against VCSs is known as hidden command at-
tacks [9, 28], which are recognizable to the VCS devices
but are incomprehensible to humans. These hidden voice
commands are generated by iteratively shaping their audio
features to meet the requirements for being understandable
to VCSs, but hard to be perceived by the users [10]. The mali-
cious hidden voice commands could be played covertly by an
adversary, in the vicinity of the victim, to make the victim’s
device inadvertently obey the adversary’s command. For
example, the adversary could play hidden voice commands
(e.g., “browse evil.com”, “call 911”) via a loudspeaker to trig-
ger actions on the victim’s VCS devices to browse phishing
sites or make spam calls to the 911 emergency center. The
hidden voice commands could also be embedded in the audio
tracks of regular media (e.g., Youtube videos, radios or TVs),
potentially controlling many VCS devices exposed to that
media [31].To ensure the successful deployment of VCS, it is
thus paramount to combat the hidden voice command attack.
In this paper, we develop a defense system that could be
integrated with VCSs by utilizing the vibration signatures
of the voice command to uniquely determine if the issued
command is provided by a human user or falls in the cate-
gory of hidden voice commands. We notice that many VCS
devices such as smartphones and standalone voice assistant
systems (e.g., HomePod1) are already equipped with motion
sensors, which could capture vibration signals caused by
voices. It has been shown that the features of speech, cap-
tured in the vibration domain, have enough information to
perform speaker identification [22]. However, Anand et al.
[5] showed that live human speech is unable to significantly
impact the on-board motion sensors of a smartphone (es-
pecially accelerometer) via aerial medium, and in order to
have a noticeable impact, the speech generating device need
to share a common solid surface with the motion sensors.
1The on-board motion sensor is to detect when HomePod is moved to start
its sound quality re-calibration [17].
We thus design two modes for our defense mechanism. First,
we let the user’s own device play back the received voice
command and use the device’s built-in sensors to measure
the vibration signatures for verifying the voice commands,
which is referred as the frontend mode. Alternatively, the
user can also choose to play back the voice commands in the
backend mode via cloud services, when the user’s VCS device
does not have motion sensors or playing back the command
may be disturbing to the user. In this mode, a low-cost device
(e.g., a loudspeaker with an on-board motion sensor) in the
cloud plays back the user’s voice command. Moreover, our
system is able to verify voice commands with partial play-
back (e.g., 0.5 second and even less than a single word) and
is easy to integrate with the VCS without causing additional
delay.
Realizing such a system that seeks to use vibration signals,
measured by the low-sampling-rate and low-fidelity motion
sensors, to discriminate live human vs. hidden voice com-
mands is challenging. To address this problem, our system
derives unique features from the vibration signals to cap-
ture the inherent vibration signatures of voice commands.
In particular, we derive the temporal and frequency statis-
tical features aiming to achieve a higher tolerance of the
errors induced by low-fidelity motion sensors. We further
seek to obtain acoustic features in the low-frequency vibra-
tion domain relying on MFCC and chroma vectors so as to
capture the speech characteristics embedded in the voice
commands. To distinguish hidden voice commands from nor-
mal commands, a feature selection strategy is developed to
find a set of features that are more discriminative to the dif-
ferences between the two types of commands and are also
relatively more independent from various people’s voices
and command contexts. This process is aided by empirically
analyzing a set of pre-collected voice commands that are
mixed with various hidden voice commands. Based on the
selected vibration features, our system could effectively de-
tect the existence of hidden voice commands using machine-
learning-based methods with only limited training efforts.
In addition, motion sensors are affected by ambient vibra-
tion noises (e.g., surface vibrations caused by environmental
noises and people walking around). Our system calibrates
the input motion sensor data by removing the mechanical
noises with a high-pass filter and identifies the data seg-
ment containing the commands by adaptively examining the
energy levels of motion data variance.
Why Vibration? Existing studies usually defend against
these hidden voice command attacks using audio domain
features, such as speech vocal features [12, 25, 30]. Carlini
et al. [9] proposed audio-feature-based classification as a
possible countermeasure to detect the hidden voice com-
mands. However, features in the audio domain have been
shown to be susceptible to duplication by voice synthesis
attacks [23]. An adversary could iteratively modify a voice
command to exhibit all of the required features desired for
recognition by a voice controllable system, while remaining
undetectable to human listeners. This vulnerability of the
audio domain features prompted us to look for the features
in the vibration domain. Different from audio, the vibration
domain features are hard to imitate for the following reasons:
(1) the vibration signatures of an audio captured by the mo-
tion sensor is unique and new, shown in the form of distinct
amplitudes, frequencies and aliased signals, which are hard
to forge or imitate from an audio signal in software (shown in
Section 4). (2) any two sounds having similar audio features
could result in distinct vibration features because the rela-
tionship between audio and vibration is non-linear (shown
in Section 5.2); and (3) the resulting vibration response is
also associated to the physical vibration properties of the
device and the specifications of the motion sensor. Thus, the
vibration domain approach can work in conjunction with the
audio domain approach to more effectively detect the hidden
voice commands. The adversary would have to mimic both
audio features and vibration features to maintain the “hid-
den voice command” characteristics of the generated voice
command.
We summarize our contributions as follows.
• Detection of Hidden Voice Commands using Vibra-
tion Domain Features of Speech: We propose a solution
in the vibration domain to detect the existence of hidden
voice commands that are incomprehensible to a human
listener but recognized by the VCSs. Our method uses
unique speech features, found in the vibration domain
including statistical time/frequency features and acoustic
features, to distinguish normal commands from hidden
voice commands. These vibration features are able to ver-
ify the voice commands with even partial voice commands
(e.g., 0.5 second).
• Design and Implementation of the Proposed De-
fense System: We design a novel classification-based de-
fense system, as the core of our proposed detection ap-
proach for distinguishing between normal commands and
hidden voice commands. We implement the proposed de-
fense system for the scenarios where an attacker may
launch hidden voice commands externally via a loud-
speaker or internally on the victim’s smartphone. We use
the inbuilt accelerometer of the victim’s device (e.g., smart-
phone or stand-alone assistant) or a low-cost device in the
cloud to measure the vibrations generated by these voice
commands, when played back completely or partially via
the speaker in the victim’s device or the cloud device, re-
spectively. We then extract and select highly discriminative
vibration features and perform machine learning-based
classification to detect the hidden voice commands.
• Evaluation of the Proposed Defense: We evaluate the
proposed defense system by classifying normal command
samples and corresponding hidden voice commands. We
perform the experiment under both frontend playback and
backend playback. Our results show that the proposed de-
fense system is able to detect these hidden voice commands
with 99.9% accuracy. These accuracies can be deemed sig-
nificant enough to believe that the proposed defense has
the potential to be successfully deployed against the hid-
den voice commands.

Security of Voice Controllable Systems. Due to the pop-
ularity of recent VCS services, such as Siri, Cortana, Google
Now and Alexa, many studies have focused on the security
issues of these systems [9, 15, 21, 23, 28, 32]. For instance,
researchers have shown that the intentional electromagnetic
interference on headphone cables can be used to inject com-
mands into voice assistants [21]. The attacker could spoof
the system by using either voice morphing techniques [23]
or the permission bypassing attack method [15]. More re-
cently, DolphinAttack [32] used the non-linearity of micro-
phones to modulate voice commands on ultrasonic carriers
to launch inaudible voice command attacks. Commander-
Song [31] stealthily embedded voice commands into songs
to launch attacks. Additionally, existing work [9, 28] demon-
strates hidden voice commands by using the mangled audio
