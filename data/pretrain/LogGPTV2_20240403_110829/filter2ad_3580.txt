1.  PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Internet  Traffic  Engineering  (TE)  is  a  very  important  research 
topic  for  production  networks,  where  TE  is  typically  formulated 
into minimizing the maximum link utilization (MLU).  For exam-
ple,  with  increasing  IPv6  traffic,  the  backbone  network  of  CER-
NET2[1]  is  suffering  big  traffic  pressure  on  some  critical  long-
haul  links  under  the  traditional  shortest-path  routing.  Taking 
CERNET2  as  an  example,  we  develop  a  practical  and  cost-
effective  intra-domain  TE  method  in  this  paper.  Existing  intra-
domain  TE  proposals,  such  as  MPLS-based  proposal  [2],  Open-
Flow-based  proposal  [3]  and  reactive-TE  proposal  [4],  need  to 
make  great  modifications  to  routers,  and  even  have  to  replace 
existing routers with brand new routers, which makes the deploy-
ment be very high-cost. Other TE proposals, such as the work [5], 
optimize OSPF weights for the goal of TE. Although these meth-
ods  have  low  deployment  cost,  they  need  to  frequently  change 
OSPF  weights  based  on  dynamically  changed  traffic  matrices. 
Each change to OSPF weights may lead to transient routing loops 
or traffic disruption. Frequent routing loops or traffic disruption is 
intolerable  for  network  operators.  Therefore,  in  this  paper,  we 
propose a new intra-domain TE method named CTE. CTE works 
in an OSPF/IS-IS network, where shortest-path routing is run. The 
core  idea of  CTE is to  use loop-free  next hops [7] to  route some 
traffic,  which  is  realized  by  configuring  some  static  routes  and 
some  access  control  list  (ACL)  rules.  CTE  does  not  make  any 
modifications  to  existing  routers.  We  only  need  to  develop  a  re-
mote  control  program  that  can  configure  static  routes  and  ACL 
rules on routers. In addition, CTE can be incrementally deployed.  
We now use an example to illustrate how CTE works. Figure 1 
is a network topology composed a set of nodes and a set of links. 
The lowercase letters beside a node denote the prefixes associated 
with  the  node.  We  suppose  that  the  capacity  of  each  link  is  100 
units  and  the  weight  of  each  link  is  1.  We  give  the  shortest-path 
tree towards  the destination F as shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2, 
the solid arrows direct the next hops towards the destination F and 
the  dash  lines  will  not  be  used  by  the  traditional  shortest-path 
routing  towards  the  destination  F.  Table  1  shows  a  prefix-
granularity traffic matrix. Table 2 shows the corresponding node- 
granularity  traffic  matrix.  Under  this  traffic  matrix,  the  MLU

achieved  by  the  traditional  shortest-path  routing  is  1.0,  which  is 
high. We now show how CTE reduces the MLU. We suppose that 
Node A and Node D are two nodes that CTE can control. Node B 
is  a  loop-free  next  hop  of  Node  A  towards  F.  Node  E  is  a  loop-
free  next  hop of Node  D towards F. For CTE, the  available next 
hops of Node A towards F are {D, B} and the available next hops 
of  Node  D  towards  F  are  {F,  E}.  Based  on  the  node-granularity 
traffic  matrix  and  the  shortest-path  routing,  we  can  calculate  the 
optimal splitting ratios across the available next hops of each CTE 
node towards each destination. We will give the specific optimiza-
tion model  of this step in Section 2. In this example, the optimal 
splitting  ratio  across  the  available  next  hops  {D,  B}  of  Node  A 
towards  F  is  3:2  in  order.  The  optimal  splitting  ratio  across  the 
available  next  hops  {F,  E}  of  Node  D  towards  F  is  1:1.  Using 
these  splitting  ratios,  the  minimum  MLU,  which  is  0.4,  can  be 
achieved.  The  next  step  of  CTE  is  to  configure  static  routes  and 
ACL rules to realize the calculated splitting ratios as close as pos-
sible. In this example, to realize the calculated splitting ratios, we 
only  need  to  configure  a  static  route  ‘reaching  the  destination    
via B’ on Node A and configure an ACL rule ‘reaching the desti-
nation    via  E  for  the  source   ’  on  Node  D.  Static  routes  and 
ACL rules have higher priority than OSPF routes. The  MLU un-
der the hybrid routers is 0.4, which the minimum. In addition, we 
design  a  mechanism  of  updating  static  routes  and  ACL  rules  to 
avoid routing loops and traffic disruption. 
2.  CTE APPROACH 
We first develop an optimization model of calculating splitting 
ratios  under  a  whole  traffic  matrix  as  shown  in  Table  3.  This 
model is named TEW model for short. We now explain the TEW 
model.                    is  the  set  of  nodes.                      is 
the set of links. We use     to denote the capacity of a link      . 
      is a traffic matrix, where     denotes the size of traffic from 
Node  i  to  Node  j.  {        |              }  is  the  set  of  routing 
variables, where     denotes the size of traffic destined to Node j 
over  Link  k.  The  splitting  ratio  over  Link  e  on  Node  i 
is  
.     (    ) denotes the available next hops of Node 
∑
     ( )
i  towards  Node  j.  If  Node  i  is  a  legacy  node,  the  available  next 
hops  of  Node  i  are  only  the  shortest-path  next  hops  of  Node  i 
towards Node j. If Node i is a CTE node, the available next hops 
of Node i are the shortest-path  next hops  and  the  loop-free  next

variables.  All  the  other  signs  are  constants.   is  a  small  enough 
constant.  The  traffic  matrix  can  be  collected  by  deploying  Net-
Flow on each node. Inspired by the work [3], we develop a model 
of calculating optimal splitting ratios under the situation that Net-
Flow  is  only  deployed  on  the  routers  that  CTE  can  control.  This 
model  is  named  TEP  model  for  short.  We  refer  readers  to  our 
technical  report [6]  for  the  TEP model.  We  now  give  the  perfor-
mance gap between the TEW model and the TEP model. 
Theorem 1. We suppose that the MLU achieved by splitting ra-
tios calculated by the TEW model is    and the MLU achieved by 
splitting ratios calculated by the TEP model is   .          
must  stand,  where   is  the  maximum  packet  loss  rate  among  all 
the ingress-egress pairs.  
Proof. See our technical report [6]. 
In the previous paragraphs, we have described how to compute 
proper splitting ratios across multiple next hops. We can configure 
static routes and ACL to  implement calculated splitting ratios.  In 
this  paper,  we  mainly  focus  on  how  to  update  static  routes  and 
ACL  rules  without  producing  any  transient  routing  loops  and 
traffic  disruption.  For  description  simplicity,  we  use  (       ) to 
denote  the  fraction  of  traffic  that  is  routed  by  the  node   via  its 
neighbor   towards the destination  . Some static routes and ACL 
rules will be configured to achieve the routing fraction  (       ). 
Our  TEW  and  TEP  models  can  guarantee  that  if   (       )  
 ,  (       )     must stand. If some static routes and ACL rules 
associated with  (       )     are installed before the static routes 
and  ACL  rules  associated  with   (       )      are  completely 
removed, transient routing loops may occur. Therefore, we design 
a reliable update mechanism as follows. 
Reliable  update  mechanism:  (a)  we  should  remove  all  the 
static routes and ACL rules associated with  (       )     before 
we  install  some  static  routes  and  ACL  rules  associated  with 
 (       )    .  (b)  if  (       )    ,  we  can  directly  install  or 
remove any static routes and ACL rules associated with  (       ).  
 Theorem  2.  The  reliable  update  mechanism  will  not  produce 
any routing loops and traffic disruption. Using the reliable update 
mechanism, we can finish the updating in at most two steps. 
Proof. See our technical report [6]. 
3.  EVALUATIONS 
All the routers in the CERNET2 backbone have deployed Net-
Flow.  We  collected  a  range  of  traffic  matrices  from  2013-02-19 
22:10:00 to 2013-03-26 15:20:00 under the traditional OSPF rout-
ing.  In  addition,  we  collected  the  capacity  of  each  link  and  the 
OSPF  weight  of  each  link.  The  traffic  matrices are  packaged  per 
five minutes. In the simulations of this paper, we assume that our 
desired  splitting  ratios  can  be  achieved  by  configuring  static 
routes and ACL, which we will evaluate in the future. We applied 
splitting  ratios  computed  by  CTE  based  on  the  previous  five-
minute  traffic  matrix  to  the  next  five-minute  traffic  matrix  and 
calculated  the  MLU  reduction  ratio,  which  is  measured  by  the 
ratio of the MLU achieved by the optimized routing (such as CTE)   
Figure 3. Partially deployed results                Figure 4. CDF curves  
to the original MLU achieved by OSPF.  Figure 3 shows results of 
the  average  MLU  reduction  ratio  during  all  the  five-minute  time 
intervals with the number of nodes that CTE can control. We find 
that  if  we  only  upgrade  two  nodes  to  support  CTE,  the  average 
MLU  reduction  ratio  will  be  0.75.  In  addition,  we  give  the  CDF 
curves of the MLU reduction ratios as shown in Figure 4. ‘CTE 2’ 
denotes the results of upgrading two routers. ‘CTE all’ denotes the 
results  of  upgrading  all  the  routers.  ‘Limit’  denotes  the  TE  limit 
results,  i.e.  assuming  that  MPLS  is  universally deployed,  desired 
splitting  ratios  can  be  realized  and  traffic  matrices  are  known  in 
advance.  From  Figure  4,  we  find  that  if  CTE  is  universally  de-
ployed, the near optimal TE can be achieved.    
4.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we propose a promising TE method named CTE. 
Without  making  any  modifications  to  existing  routers,  CTE  only 
needs  a  remote  control  program  to  configure  static  routes  and 
ACL  rules.  Moreover,  CTE  is  incrementally  deployable.  Our 
evaluation  results  show  that  CTE  achieves  near  optimal  TE  per-
formance  when  fully  deployed,  and  achieves  considerable  TE 
performance when partially deployed. Some future work include: 
how  to  use  minimum  number  of  static  routes  and  ACL  rules  to 
achieve  the  desired  splitting  ratios  and  how  to  incrementally  up-
date static routes and ACL rules.
