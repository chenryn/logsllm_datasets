Amazon AWS is the world's largest and most mature cloud computing platform, which provides almost all types of cloud services, including computing, storage, database, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc. The advantage of AWS is that it has strong performance, good stability, and supports a wide range of application scenarios. The disadvantage is that the learning threshold is high, the complexity is high, and it is not friendly enough for beginners. Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform launched by Microsoft, which includes all the main services of cloud computing, including computing, storage, database, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, etc. The advantage of Azure is that it is easy to use, fast to promote, and friendly to enterprise users; the disadvantage is that its performance is poor and its stability is not as good as that of AWS. Google Cloud Platform is a cloud computing platform launched by Google, which covers computing, storage, database, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other services. The advantage of GCP is that it has fast performance and is superior to other cloud computing platforms in terms of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The disadvantage is that the market share is small and user support is not perfect. In general, which cloud computing platform to choose should be decided according to the actual needs and technical capabilities of your own business.
