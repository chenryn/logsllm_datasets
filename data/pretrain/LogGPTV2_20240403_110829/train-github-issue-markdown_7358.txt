I started noticing a white trail when resizing the Atom window if a medium-
sized file is loaded (or larger). This GIF was made with a file that has 1000
lines and `This is a test` text in every other line:

(sorry for the quality! still learning how to create GIFs)
The trail is shown only when the resizing increases the size of the window,
not when the size is decreased.
Atom version 31.0. OSX 10.8.5
