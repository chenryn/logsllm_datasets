7 Related Work
Parking services. Although domain parking services
have been here for years, little has been done to under-
stand their security implications. What comes close are
the works on typo-squatting [37, 22, 9], which reveals
that domain owners utilize this technique for proﬁt. Also,
prior research shows that malicious domains tend to be
parked once detected [27, 17]. Most related to our re-
search is the study on click spam [10], which focuses
on click-spam detection and also mentions the possible
involvement of one parking service (Sedo) in such ac-
tivities based on its JavaScript. Such code was not found
in our research. Compared with the prior work, what we
did is a systematic study on the illicit activities of parking
services, which has never been done before. This is made
possible by the new inﬁltration analysis we performed.
Our study not only conﬁrms the presence of illicit opera-
tions within parking services but also brings to light their
scope and magnitude.
Illicit activities in online advertising. Ad-related il-
licit activities have been extensively studied. Exam-
ples include click-fraud [21, 4, 5, 11, 25], drive-by-
download [18], trending-term exploitation [23] and im-
pression fraud [32]. Such prior work all looks at a con-
ventional adversary who performs malicious activities
whenever possible. The parking services, however, are
very different: they run legitimate business with adver-
tisers and ad networks. However, our study reveals that a
signiﬁcant portion of their revenues actually come from
illicit activities, which raises the awareness about this
completely unregulated business.
Inﬁltration into malicious infrastructure. To under-
stand how underground businesses work, a lot of stud-
ies attempt to inﬁltrate their business infrastructure. Ex-
amples include the work on Spam [16, 15], CAPTCHA
solving [24], blackhat SEO [36] and Pay-per-install net-
works [8]. Different from such prior research, we need
to inﬁltrate the parking monetization process without dis-
rupting its operations. This was achieved using a new ap-
proach through which we controlled some nodes on both
ends of the monetization ecosystem and managed to link
them together.
8 Conclusion
This paper reports the ﬁrst systematic study on illicit ac-
tivities in parked domain monetization. To demystify this
“dark side” of parking services, we devised an inﬁltra-
tion analysis to gain control of some start nodes and end
nodes of the parking ecosystem, and then connect the
dots, sending our crawling trafﬁc across the nodes under
our control on the both ends, with the monetization enti-
ties (domain parking services, ad networks) in-between.
This analysis provided us a unique observation of the
whole monetization process, which enabled us to con-
ﬁrm the presence of click fraud, trafﬁc spam and trafﬁc
stealing. We further expanded those seed chains to mil-
lions of monetization chains collected over 5.5 months,
using the stamps of their monetization options. Over
such data, our study revealed the pervasiveness of the
illicit monetization practices and their revenues, which
calls for policy efforts to control those illicit operations.

Appendix
The true operation of
the shady search sites.
fastonlinefinder.com is one of a large number
of search sites we refer to as “shady”. They are shady
in that they rarely display organic results and emphasize
on sponsored ads. Moreover, they have been reported in
previous works on click fraud [18, 4] and have been pre-
sumed malicious to some extent. Additionally, many vic-
tims have often complained about a “redirect” malware
hijacking their trafﬁc and redirecting to these search sites
as shown in Figure 5.
Through our empirical investigations, we discovered
the actual role they play. We found their true operation
was to act as click servers for search ads (similar to tradi-
tional click servers of other none search advertisements)
and as such they are owned and operated by ad-nets. An-
other use of those search sites was to set the click referral
and as such, the advertiser will assume their ad was dis-
played on the referring search site.
It is important to note here, that the use of such search
sites is not illegal. It is only misunderstood due to their
abuse by ad-net publishers. A fraudulent publisher will
use a malware or Trojan to generate clicks on their ads
and since the clicks lead to an ad-net’s search sites, the

association. Note that the same website used here for our

Evidence Survey. Along our inﬁltration we collect a set
of evidence to support our ﬁndings. We start with Figure
6 which conﬁrms trafﬁc stealing by one parking service
that is not reporting trafﬁc, as shown in 6(a), which have
been monetized through 7search and veriﬁed by our
payment for the trafﬁc as shown in 6(b).
