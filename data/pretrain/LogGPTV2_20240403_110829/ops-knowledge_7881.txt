User: Please list at least three different load balancing algorithms and analyze their pros and cons.
Assistant: 1. Polling algorithm The polling algorithm will distribute requests to each server in sequence, and each request will be evenly distributed to different servers, so as to achieve the purpose of load balancing. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to implement, and requests can be quickly allocated to different servers, which is suitable for situations with a small number of servers. The disadvantage is that the load of the server cannot be considered, and the server overload cannot be effectively avoided. At the same time, the response time of the server may be inconsistent. 2. Algorithm of the least number of connections The algorithm of the least number of connections allocates requests according to the current number of connections of the server, and preferentially allocates requests to servers with fewer connections, so as to achieve the purpose of load balancing. The advantage is that it can effectively avoid server overload and improve the response speed and load capacity of the server. The disadvantage is that the algorithm needs to record the number of connections of each server, which increases the complexity of the system, and is not friendly to the support of automatic server expansion. 3. Weighted Round Robin Algorithm The weighted round robin algorithm allocates requests according to the weight of servers, servers with high weights will get more requests, and servers with low weights will get fewer requests. By adjusting the weight of the server, more accurate load balancing can be achieved. The advantage is that it can perform load distribution according to the actual situation of the server, which is suitable for the situation where there are a large number of servers and the load changes frequently. The disadvantage is that the implementation complexity is high, and the weight of each server needs to be adjusted, and the load change should be monitored and adjusted in real time.
