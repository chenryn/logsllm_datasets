You Want Answers?
What is an acceptable level of mass-market encryption?
128-bit SSL is standard in the browser and OS, we need 
fingerprinting, encryption and steganography
How does the “average joe” fingerprint and protect their daily 
communication?
Use M from multiple points of access for max reliability
What are the true benefits of open-source vs. major company-
owned encryption services?
Open-source is expandable, solid, reliable, free-of-influence 
(political, etc.)
What percentage of your daily digital communication is sent 
unencrypted?
National average=15%, strive for 50% of important info
How do we deem information important? Test: a leak would 
cause detrimental financial impact
How do we accelerate the adoption of PHP at the server level?
PHP high-quality applications that are anywhere-deployable
PHP that pushes boundaries and innovates
PHP that opens new markets and propels the languages‟ dev

General Encryption.1
Why Use Encryption?
40-bit SSL can be cracked by an Intel 
Pentium 266 in one hour
Reduce leaks of competitive company 
info & reduce liability
ITworld.com: provides authentication, 
integrity and accountability
Unencrypted records can be 
subpoenaed
Maintain file integrity over lossy 
TCP/IP Base64/MIME
Manyonymity is easy with a quick 
learning curve and more sophisticated 
features as expertise grows
Manyonymity:
General Encryption.2
Key Concepts
Algorithm: mathematical formula used 
to transform information
Fingerprinting: representing a file with 
a one-way key that only the unique 
makeup of that file would yield
Encryption: replacing information with 
a new representation of that 
information, often using an algorithm
Steganography: hiding information 
almost imperceptibly in a picture or 
other file (for example, JPEG or MP3)
Geometric Transformation: using 
geometry and its formulas to encrypt 
data, developing theory
Manyonymity:
General Encryption.3
Geometric Transformations
Using geometric formulas such as the 
area of a circle as an algorithm to 
generate strong, difficult-to-reverse 
results when encrypting
Example: Area Of A Circle
• Given the area of a circle, calculate the 
dot density of the perimeter
• Use the simple dot density value 
(100/inch) to reverse for the area
• Area + dot density value=seed
• Send the dot density value via email
Could be used with other functions and 
shapes, could be combined
Strung together like a key chain, 
reversible only if one knew each notch

Introduction To M.1
What is Manyonymity?
Distributed: an encryption system with 
centralized server lists used to link 
logon information, facilitate searches 
and alert installations re: updates
Modular: add additional encryption 
options using secure, authenticated 
delivery as they become available (i.e. 
steganography for MP3)
Innovative: designed to bring 
encryption to everyone by making 
fingerprinting and encryption 
accessible without sacrificing the 
option of more sophisticated features
Manyonymity:
Introduction To M.2
Key Points
Easier to use than existing add-on 
Windows or Linux apps that compute 
MD5 hashes, quick email links provide 
one-click accessibility of verification
New methods of encryption ranging 
from simple (byte-shifting or XOR) to 
complex (geometric transformation or 
Twofish) immediately usable
Plugin modules allow deployments to 
evolve as fingerprinting and encryption 
methods change
Open-source will ensure rock-solid, 
smooth and fast code
Requirements: Apache 1.3.x, PHP 
4.3.x, MySQL 4.0.x, mcrypt
Manyonymity:
Installing M.1
 Tips for Apache,  PHP 
& MySQL
 Download & unzip
 Change mconfig.php 
options
 Test installation & 
register server
 Demo: configuring 
Manyonymity, 
bringing it to “GO”
Manyonymity:
Installing M.2
 Tips for Apache,  PHP & MySQL
 Download latest versions of all software, 
watch for problems (i.e. Apache 2.x 
experimental w/ PHP 4)
 Only turn on PHP options in „php.ini-
recommended‟ that are required, limit ext.
 Remove all MySQL user accounts except 
localhost/root and add strong password
 Set new values for max_execution_time= and 
memory_limit= compatible with hardware
 Only open Apache/HTTP port 80 through 
firewall, watch Slashdot for recent patches
Manyonymity:
Installing M.3
 Download & unzip
 Get the latest version from M 
homepage [www.manyonymity.com]
 Compatible with Linux and Windows, 
.tar and .zip are identical
 Comes with modules: TCRYPT & 
MD5FING, must authorize!
 Use MD5 hash to verify download
 Unpack to www with directory structure
Manyonymity:
Installing M.4
 Change mconfig.php options
 Verify $masterserver matches M homepage
 Set $serverroot= to your absolute URL, i.e. 
[www.getanygame.com/m/]
 Create MySQL db, set db name and password
 Set security level, see comments, recommend 
setting „H‟ for high
 Configure color scheme via hex or word color 
codes, i.e. „#FFFFFF‟ or „black‟
Manyonymity:
Installing M.5
 Test installation & register server
 Run „Test Installation‟ tool, make 
changes accordingly, M won‟t accept 
logins until „Test Installation‟ generates 
(0) errors at runtime
 Run „Register Server‟ tool to establish 
your server with the Master, will add 
your installation and poll for 
availability, statistics
