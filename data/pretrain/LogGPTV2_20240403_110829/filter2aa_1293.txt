## Key Questions to Consider
1. **What is an acceptable level of mass-market encryption?**
   - 128-bit SSL is standard in browsers and operating systems. We need fingerprinting, encryption, and steganography.
   
2. **How does the average person protect their daily communication?**
   - Use Manyonymity from multiple points of access for maximum reliability.
   
3. **What are the true benefits of open-source vs. major company-owned encryption services?**
   - Open-source is expandable, reliable, and free from external influences (political, etc.).
   
4. **What percentage of your daily digital communication is sent unencrypted?**
   - The national average is 15%. Strive for 50% of important information to be encrypted.
   - Importance can be determined by whether a leak would cause detrimental financial impact.
   
5. **How do we accelerate the adoption of PHP at the server level?**
   - Develop high-quality, deployable PHP applications.
   - Innovate and push boundaries with PHP.
   - Open new markets and propel the development of the language.

## General Encryption
### Why Use Encryption?
- **Security:** 40-bit SSL can be cracked by an Intel Pentium 266 in one hour.
- **Protection:** Reduces leaks of competitive company information and reduces liability.
- **Authentication, Integrity, and Accountability:** ITworld.com highlights these benefits.
- **Legal Protection:** Unencrypted records can be subpoenaed.
- **File Integrity:** Maintains file integrity over lossy TCP/IP Base64/MIME.
- **Ease of Use:** Manyonymity has a quick learning curve and offers more sophisticated features as expertise grows.

### Key Concepts
- **Algorithm:** A mathematical formula used to transform information.
- **Fingerprinting:** Represents a file with a one-way key unique to that file.
- **Encryption:** Replaces information with a new representation using an algorithm.
- **Steganography:** Hides information almost imperceptibly in files like JPEGs or MP3s.
- **Geometric Transformation:** Uses geometric formulas to encrypt data, developing theory.

### Geometric Transformations
- **Example:** Using the area of a circle to generate strong, difficult-to-reverse results when encrypting.
  - Given the area of a circle, calculate the dot density of the perimeter.
  - Use the simple dot density value (e.g., 100/inch) to reverse for the area.
  - Area + dot density value = seed.
  - Send the dot density value via email.
- **Combination:** Can be used with other functions and shapes, combined, and strung together like a key chain, reversible only if one knows each notch.

## Introduction to Manyonymity
### What is Manyonymity?
- **Distributed:** An encryption system with centralized server lists to link logon information, facilitate searches, and alert installations about updates.
- **Modular:** Add additional encryption options using secure, authenticated delivery as they become available (e.g., steganography for MP3).
- **Innovative:** Designed to bring encryption to everyone by making fingerprinting and encryption accessible without sacrificing the option of more sophisticated features.

### Key Points
- **Ease of Use:** Easier to use than existing add-on Windows or Linux apps that compute MD5 hashes.
- **New Methods:** Ranging from simple (byte-shifting or XOR) to complex (geometric transformation or Twofish).
- **Plugin Modules:** Allow deployments to evolve as fingerprinting and encryption methods change.
- **Open-Source:** Ensures rock-solid, smooth, and fast code.
- **Requirements:** Apache 1.3.x, PHP 4.3.x, MySQL 4.0.x, mcrypt.

## Installation
### Tips for Apache, PHP & MySQL
- **Download & Unzip:** Get the latest version from the Manyonymity homepage [www.manyonymity.com].
- **Change mconfig.php Options:** Verify $masterserver matches the Manyonymity homepage, set $serverroot to your absolute URL, create a MySQL database, set the db name and password, set security level, and configure color scheme.
- **Test Installation & Register Server:** Run the "Test Installation" tool and make changes accordingly. Run the "Register Server" tool to establish your server with the Master.
- **Demo:** Configuring Manyonymity, bringing it to “GO”.

## Maintenance (Admin)
### Maintaining Inter-Server Relationships
- **Why?:** Ensures universal login, integrated searches, and alerts/updates.
- **Server List:** Communicates server status, popularity, and available modules.
- **MD5 Admin Password:** Don’t forget to add it.
- **Update Server Info:** Run after any changes to catalog your server and update its listing.

### Reports & Alerts
- **Statistics:** Calculated in real-time include active uses of each module, member signups, and volume indicators.
- **Reports:** Include historical uses of each module, member detail, and db consistency.
- **Alerts:** Delivered in a “task list” format, highlighting unperformed maintenance and updates.

### Adding Modules
- **Module List:** Available at the Manyonymity homepage.
