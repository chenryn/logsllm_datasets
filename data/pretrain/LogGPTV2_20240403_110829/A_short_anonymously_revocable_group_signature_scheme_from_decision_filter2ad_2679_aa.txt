ABSTRACT
In group signature schemes, a signature is anonymous for
a veriﬁer, while only a designated Privacy Manager (P M )
can identify the signer. This identiﬁcation is used for tracing
a dishonest anonymous signer in case of an illegal act using
the signature. However, P M can violate signers’ anonymity.
Recently, Brickell and Li propose a novel countermeasure
for the anonymous dishonest signer without P M in the set-
ting of the direct anonymous attestation. Here, we call the
generalized group signature version anonymously revocable
group signature scheme. In this scheme, after an illegal act
using a group signature was found, the membership of the
dishonest signer can be anonymously revoked for excluding
the signer without the help of any P M . However, since
the Brickell-Li scheme is based on the RSA assumption and
the DDH assumption, the signature is long. In this paper,
we propose a short anonymously revocable group signature
scheme from supersingular curves, where we adopt the de-
cision linear (DLIN) assumption. Compared to the simple
adoption of the Brickell-Li DDH-based revoking approach to
supersingular curves, the length of our signature is reduced
to about from 30% to 60%.

INTRODUCTION
Group signature scheme [5] allows a group member to
anonymously sign a message on behalf of a group, where
the membership of the group is controlled by a group man-
ager (GM ). The simple but important application is an

anonymous authentication between anonymous users (group
members) and the servers (GM or veriﬁers). Consider a
network service available for only valid users. In advance,
a user registers with GM to join the group. In the authen-
tication for the use of the service, the user sends his group
signature to a server in order to convince the server that
the user is valid for the service as a group member. The
anonymity of the group signature can protect users’ pri-
vacy from servers. However, in case of complete anonymity,
dishonest users may make abuse of the services, since the
users are untraceable. For example, in an anonymous BBS
(Bulletin Board System), Weblog services, or SNS (Social
Network Services), an anonymous user may submit libelous
articles, while it is diﬃcult to trace the user. For solving
this problem, the group signature schemes have introduced a
designated party who can identify the signer from the group
signature. We call this party a privacy manager (P M ) here.
Then, after a user made abuse in an anonymous service, the
user can be traced by P M via the group signature.
However, P M can violate signers’ anonymity, whereas the
signers are unaware of the violation. Thus, P M can collect
users’ privacy secretly, and P M may be a big brother.
We can ﬁnd a countermeasure against the anonymous
abuse without introducing P M , in a direct anonymous at-
testation (DAA) scheme [4]. The DAA scheme is a vari-
ant of group signature scheme without P M , which is de-
signed for the remote authentication of a Trusted Platform
Module (TPM) while keeping user’s privacy. The TPM can
anonymously prove to a remote server that it is a valid mod-
ule. This scheme has a novel anonymously revoking method;
The membership of a dishonest user can be anonymously re-
voked and the user is excluded without the help of any P M .
Namely, the dishonest user remains anonymous after the il-
legal acts, but the signatures that the dishonest user issues
after the revocation, can be detected. In this method, when
GM and/or veriﬁers want to exclude a dishonest user who
issued a signature ˆσ, they add a tag included in ˆσ into RL.
Given RL, another honest signer computes his signature σ
ensuring that the signer of σ is diﬀerent from the signer of ˆσ
in RL. Thus, the veriﬁers can check whether a signer is the
dishonest signer or not, and can revoke the anonymous dis-
honest signer. Except for this check, the signature reveals no
information about the signer to all veriﬁers and even GM ,
and thus there is no big brother. In addition, even if a user
is illegally revoked via RL generated by dishonest veriﬁers,
the user can be aware of the revocation by checking the tags
in RL. To emphasize the anonymous revocation in the set-
ting of general group signatures instead of DAA, we call such
337
a scheme anonymously revocable group signature scheme.
The disadvantage of the anonymously revocable group sig-
nature scheme is that the identity of the dishonest signer is
untraceable. Thus, it is not suitable for applications where
illegal acts cause very serious problems. On the other hand,
it can be suitable for the situation where illegal acts make
other users unpleasant, or the problems caused by dishonest
users can be compensated by insurance. An example of the
applications is the anonymous authentication in an anony-
mous BBS, Weblog, or SNS. By the scheme, the dishonest
user who sent a libelous article is anonymously excluded and
the following articles can be stopped by the server (i.e, ver-
iﬁer), while the anonymity of other users remains.
The previous scheme [4] is based on the strong RSA as-
sumption and the DDH assumption. However, since we need
the RSA modulus with the long key size (1024 bits or more),
signatures becomes long.
In this paper, we explore an anonymously revocable group
signature scheme from bilinear maps, since pairing-friendly
elliptic curves make signatures short. Let e : G×H → T be a
bilinear map (i.e., pairing) on groups G,H,T with the same
prime order. Then, since we can have the DDH assumption
on T , we can simply adapt the DDH-based anonymously
revoking method of [4] to T . However, elements of T must
be as long as the RSA modulus, and thus we cannot expect
short signatures. On the other hand, we can ﬁnd the XDH
(eXternal DH) assumption [3], where the DDH assumption
holds on G with short elements. It can be expected that this
assumption is true in a subset of non-supersingular curves,
but this does not hold for supersingular curves (i.e., G = H).
In [6], we can ﬁnd an alternative method for short signatures,
where, in addition to bilinear groups G,H,T , another DDH
group with the same order is utilized. Using these groups, we
achieve the DDH-based anonymously revoking method with
short signatures (Very recently, the solution is proposed in
[8]). However, in this case, implementations of two elliptic
curves are required, which is an overhead.
In this paper, we propose a short anonymously revocable
scheme that can be eﬃciently implemented by supersingular
curves with the embedding degree 6, in the random oracle
model. To achieve the anonymity, instead of using the DDH
assumption, we adopt the decision linear (DLIN) assumption
often used in pairing-based group signature schemes [2, 3].
The length of our signature is about from 30% to 60% of the
signature that is simply adapted the DDH-based method of
[4] on T , where the ratio varies according to the number of
revoked members. In almost all cases (more than 2 revoked
members), the ratio is from 30% to 40%.
2. MODEL AND SECURITY DEFINITIONS
The previous work [4] proves the security in a universally
composable framework. On the other hand,
it is popu-
lar that literatures on recent group signatures (e.g, [2, 3,
6]) prove the security in the model formalizing attacking
games [1]. Thus, we adopt the latter model.
The participants in the model are group members (users),
veriﬁers, and GM .
A anonymously revocable group signature scheme consists
of the following algorithms and protocols. Non-negative in-
teger (cid:96) is a security parameter.
Setup: This probabilistic initial setup algorithm, on input
1(cid:96), outputs public parameters param.
KeyGen: This probabilistic key generation algorithm for
GM , on input param, outputs the group public key
gpk and GM ’s secret key msk. Assume that gpk in-
cludes param.
Join: This is an interactive protocol between a probabilistic
algorithm Join-U for the i-th user and a probabilis-
tic algorithm Join-GM for GM , where the user joins
the group managed by GM w.r.t. gpk. Join-U, on
input gpk, outputs usk[i] that is the user’s secret key.
On the other hand, Join-GM, on inputs gpk, msk,
outputs nothing.
Sign: This probabilistic algorithm, on inputs gpk, usk[i], a
revocation list RL of tags of revoked signatures, and
a message M to be signed, outputs the signature σ
including a tag part tag.
Verify: This is a deterministic algorithm for veriﬁcation.
The input is gpk, a signature σ, a revocation list RL,
and the message M . Then the output is ’valid’ or ’in-
valid’. The validity means that the signature is issued
by a group member, and that the signer is diﬀerent
from the signers computing tags in RL.
The security requirements, t-revocability, anonymity, non-
frameability are informally deﬁned as follows. The formal
deﬁnitions will be shown in the full paper.
t-Revocability: This property captures the unforgeability
of the signature in the environment that signatures can
be anonymously revoked, which is derived from the
traceability in the conventional group signatures [1].
Consider the revocability game between an adversary
A and the challenger, where A corrupting t members
tries to forge t + 1 valid signatures σ0, . . . , σt including
tag0, . . ., tagt respectively. The revocation list RL0
given to σ0 is empty, and RLi given to σi is (tag0, . . .,
tagi−1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ t. Namely, A tries to forge a valid
signature after t signatures are revoked. A can request
joining for honest users and corrupted users, honest
user’s signing, and corrupting honest users. The t-
revocability requires that for all PPT A, the probabil-
ity that A wins the revocability game is negligible.
Anonymity: This is deﬁned as well as traceable signature
scheme [7]. Consider the anonymity game between an
adversary A and a challenger, where A tries to guess
the identity of the signer among two non-corrupted
candidates given a signature in the situation that even
GM is corrupted. The permitted queries are joining
for honest users, honest user’s signing, and corrupt-
ing honest users. The anonymity requires that for all
PPT A, the advantage of A on the anonymity game is
negligible.
Non-Frameability: This requires that a signature of an
honest member cannot be computed by other members
and even GM .
In the conventional group signature
scheme, this property is required to protect the honest
member against being illegally traced from a signature
that was not issued by the member.
In the anony-
mously revocable setting, the honest member cannot
be traced, but may be illegally revoked using the tag.
This is why this non-frameability is also required in
the anonymous revocation setting.

versary A and a challenger, where A tries to forge a
signature of a honest member. In this game, A also
corrupts GM . Thus, the permitted queries are the
same as the anonymity game. The non-frameability
