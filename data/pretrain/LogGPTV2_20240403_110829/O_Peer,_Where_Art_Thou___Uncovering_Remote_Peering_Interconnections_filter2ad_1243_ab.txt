However, in our work we show that RTT alone [36] is not suf-
ficient to achieve accurate inference (see Section 4). Instead, we
combine RTT measurements with several other domain-specific
design aspects of remote peering and achieve significantly larger
accuracy and coverage levels, calculated using a substantial valida-
tion dataset. Our goal is to establish a general, thoroughly validated
RP inference methodology and yield valuable insights on the global
RP ecosystem.
3 DATASETS & MEASUREMENTS
3.1 Active Measurement Sources
We employ ping measurements to estimate the latency (RTT) be-
tween an IXP and its member ASes, and traceroute measurements
to extract the IP-level paths traversing peering links.
Pings. We conduct ping measurements from a number of Van-
tage Points (VPs), namely Looking Glasses (LGs) and RIPE Atlas
probes (RA); the exact location of these VPs is known. Castro et
al. [36] used the PCH LGs [15] that provided access to PCH border
routers deployed in 22 IXPs. Unfortunately, PCH does not allow
ping queries through their LGs anymore. Instead, using IXP web-
sites, we compiled a list of 23 publicly accessible LGs, that provide
direct interfaces inside the IXP networks, e.g., to an IXP route server.
To automate the querying of these LGs we use the Periscope plat-
form [45].
We augment the set of the ping-enabled VPs through RA [19], a
well-established global Internet measurement platform with more
than 25,000 probes. To identify RA probes colocated with IXP in-
frastructure, we search for probes with source IPs in the address
space of an IXP’s peering LAN, and for probes which resolve to an
ASN assigned to an IXP NOC4. We discovered 66 such RA probes.
Merging the available LG and RA VPs provides good coverage
in the RIPE (29 IXPs) and APNIC (11 IXPs) regions. Only 6 IXPs
4 Note that probes connected to the IXP members themselves are not useful for our
methodology, since these members can be also remote to the IXP, and thus may affect
the RTT-based inference step biasing the ping measurements.

AFRINIC.
Traceroutes. We collect all the publicly available RA IPv4 tracer-
oute measurements (i.e., built-in and user-defined) [19]. In total,
we study 3.15 billion traceroute paths towards 600K IPs, probed
between Jan. 2017 and Mar. 2018. We use the collected traceroute
paths to extract IP-level IXP crossings (see Section 3.3 and steps 3,
4 of Section 5.2), as well as private connections between ASes over
facilities (see step 5 of Section 5.2).
3.2 IXP Peering LANs and Ports
Our methodology combines multiple sources of IXP-related infor-
mation with the measurements of Section 3.1.
IXPs, members, and interfaces. To identify traceroute hops that
traverse IXPs, and feed our methodology with IXP-related infor-
mation, we combine multiple sources to build an up-to-date list of
IXPs, their members, and the associated IXP interfaces (i.e., IP ad-
dresses belonging to IXP prefixes that are assigned to IXP member
ASes). We retrieve the related IXP information directly from IXP
websites by parsing the provided Euro-IX [52] json and/or csv
machine-readable formats, and the publicly available databases of
Hurricane Electric (HE) [11], PeeringDB (PDB) [16], and Packet
Clearing House (PCH) [15].
To address cases of conflicting data, we consider IXP websites as
the most reliable source of information since the data are directly
provided by the IXP operators; in fact, while websites may share
peering policy information with e.g., PeeringDB, they maintain
their own IXP-related information, such as membership lists. We
then rank the other IXP sources based on their fraction of conflict-
ing entries compared to the website data (Table 1). Consequently,
we apply the following preference ordering to resolve conflicts:
IX P websites > HE > PDB > PCH.
The final dataset includes 31, 690 IXP IP-to-AS mappings (IXP
interfaces) and 729 IXP prefixes from 703 IXPs (Table 1). Interest-
ingly enough, the IXP prefixes and interfaces that are unique in
the websites are quite few (4 and 24 respectively), since the other
databases are usually populated with up-to-date entries. To the
best of our knowledge, the collected dataset comprises the most
complete list of IXPs, IXP prefixes, and IXP interfaces to-date.
IXP port capacity. We record the capacity of the peering ports
allocated to each IXP member, using the json/csv datasets directly
provided through the IXP websites, and the PDB records. For each
IXP, we also compile the available port capacity options through
the pricing section of its website [70]. As we explain in Section 5.1.1,
knowing the port capacities allows us to distinguish IXP peers that

CoreSite LA1 facility, PDB reports 108 ASes (∼43%) that are not
listed in Coresite’s list of locally deployed networks [6], indicating
possible inaccuracies in PDB. Even in the face of such artifacts, the
combination of the heuristics we apply in Section 5 results to high
accuracy/coverage.
3.5 IXP Local/Remote Members for Validation
Inferring remote peering accurately, requires thorough investiga-
tion of the challenges related to interconnectivity between IXPs and
their members, as well as information to validate the peering infer-
ence itself. To this end, we contacted IXP operators and requested
lists specifying which of their members are local and/or remote.
We received validation data5 for 6 IXPs. However, the provided
lists do not cover the entire list of the members of these IXPs. This
is due to the fact that IXP operators usually know whether their
members are connected through resellers, but not where they are
located, or if they use a L2 carrier to access their colocation facilities.
In essence, they do not/cannot know “what goes on beyond that
cable” [23]; a gap that is the primary motivation of this work.
We further augmented the validation dataset by manually ex-
tracting lists of remote and local members from websites of IXPs
that publish the port type of their members (physical or virtual
through a reseller). In total, we collected validation data for 6 IXPs
directly from their operators, and for 9 more IXPs from their web-
sites. In addition, we enriched the total IXP list in the validation
dataset with the facilities at which the IXPs are present based on
data from Section 3.4. All relevant statistics are shown in Table 2.
We split the validation dataset in two subsets, “control” and “test”,
depending on whether they include IXPs with publicly accessible
colocated VPs from which ping measurements can be triggered. The
reason for this discrimination is that we need to (i) re-evaluate ex-
isting inference approaches [36] and investigate further challenges
in order to fine-tune our approach, and (ii) properly validate the full
methodology using active measurements. Since only the test subset
contains IXPs with accessible ping-enabled VPs, we used the control
subset to evaluate latency-wise inference challenges (see Section
4), and the test subset to ping local and/or remote target interfaces
