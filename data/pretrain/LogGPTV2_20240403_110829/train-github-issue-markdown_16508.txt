under OSX 10.10.3 atom build 0.199.0 if you close all windows then hit
atom->preferences the preferences windows does not come up. You have to do it
twice.
If using keyboard shortcuts you must hit command+, two times in order to
actually get the presences window.
Expected behavior: hit it once and the preferences window comes up. If no
windows are currently open then it should not only open a window, but then
automatically open preferences.
