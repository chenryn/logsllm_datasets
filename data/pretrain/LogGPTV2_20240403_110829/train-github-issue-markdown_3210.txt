## Steps to Reproduce
I am attempting to create my first Flutter application. After creating a new project in Android Studio, I added the `shared_preferences` plugin (version 0.3.3) to the `pubspec.yaml` file. However, this caused the iOS build to fail. I have managed to isolate the issue with the following command line steps:

1. `flutter create -i swift hello`
2. `cd hello`
3. Edit `pubspec.yaml` to include: `shared_preferences: ^0.3.3`

**Note:** I suspect that this issue might occur with any Objective-C based plugin, not just `shared_preferences`.
