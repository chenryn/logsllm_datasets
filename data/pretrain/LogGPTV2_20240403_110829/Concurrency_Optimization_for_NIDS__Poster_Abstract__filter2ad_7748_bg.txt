PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sylvia Karin Neef, Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology Stuttgart, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Heike Horn, Stefan Winter, Ute Hofmann, Thomas E. Muerdter, Elke Schaeffeler, German Ott, Matthias Schwab, Mathias Haag
Nontargeted tissue metabolomics is a promising approach for the assessment of tumor-specific alterations and biomarker identification In this 
regard, molecular profiling experiments could benefit from the opportunity to use clinical specimens archived as formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) tissue We developed a method for nontargeted metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of FFPE tissue samples and carried out protocol 
optimization by systematic assessment of assay reproducibility (analytical precision and technical reproducibility) for structurally annotated 
metabolites Comparison of porcine FFPE tissue with fresh-frozen samples revealed high overlap of metabolic features in organic (>90%) and in 
aqueous (>85%) extracts indicating high preservation of polar and nonpolar metabolites in FFPE tissue Notably, a considerable proportion of 
features were exclusively detected in FFPE tissue which could in part be assigned as N-methylated and N-formylated phosphatidylethanolamine 
species indicating headgroup-specific modifications of lipids during fixation Further assessment of tissue size and fixation time on analyte recovery 
revealed metabolite class-specific differences in their detection abundance In this regard, the recovery of specific lipids (eg phosphatidylinositoles 
and acylcarnitines) remained largely unaffected thus rendering these molecules as potential biomarkers useful for future diagnostic applications 
Finally, the applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by analyzing a set of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and corresponding 
nontumorous FFPE tissue samples, achieving clear phenotypic distinction on the basis of their metabolomic profiles Notably, metabolites found to 
be significantly altered between ccRCC and nontumorous FFPE samples showed considerable overlap (>20%) with metabolites previously identified 
to differ between ccRCC and nontumorous in fresh-frozen kidney tissue

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are often used for commercial production of recombinant therapeutic proteins Optimization of cell culture medium 
and feeds is required to obtain maximum product yield Metabolomics analysis allows for quick determination of nutrient limitations or metabolite 
buildup during cell culture To better understand the metabolic events affecting cell biomass and antibody titer, we designed a semi-targeted workflow 
to confidently measure critical nutrients while allowing for the discovery of previously unidentified metabolites that affect growth and antibody yield 
Separate cultures of CHO cells expressing the same recombinant antibody were supplemented with 6 different feeds and extracellular metabolites 
were sampled at different timepoints Our analytical platform comprised of a dual UHPLC system for RP and HILIC separation of the same sample 
enabling increased analysis throughput while improving metabolome coverage, and the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid MS, with AcquireX 
intelligent acquisition software, for maximizing the number of metabolites interrogated by MS/MS resulting in confident metabolite annotations An in-
house spectral library of 60 metabolites was constructed from authentic standards to ensure confident identification Differential analysis of cell media 
provided robust metabolic indicators of cell growth and antibody yield The semi-targeted approach rapidly detected amino acid and vitamin depletion 
for some of the feeds correlating to improved titer in shorter times Overlapping two LC separations resulted in a 30% decrease in analysis time without 
compromising reproducibility or compound detection This high-throughput semi-targeted workflow provided greater understanding for the rational 
design of cell media and feeds for improved commercial biopharmaceutical production

An iterative approach integrating metabolomics with sensory science to improve the horticultural quality
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Victor Castro-Alves, Örebro University, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Irina Kalbina, Åsa Öström, Åke Strid, Tuulia Hyötyläinen
The integration between metabolomics with sensory studies can be a powerful tool to improve the overall taste and aroma of horticultural produce; 
however, improvements in sensory quality have been inferred mostly on changes of specific metabolites It also is not entirely clear what is the 
relationship between what consumers regard as a crop with increased sensory quality and potential metabolites that influences its sensory 
attributes Thus, we propose an iterative approach to increase the sensory quality of horticultural produce by applying comprehensive metabolic 
characterization by GC-Orbitrap and LC-QTOFMS and integrating the data both with sensory data and growing conditions using advanced 
bioinformatics tools Each round of data correlation leads to suggestions of improvements in crop production, which were taken through cycles 
to arrive at an improved production protocol To show the feasibility of this approach, we addressed the reduction of quality in herbs grown at 
greenhouses caused by the lack of UV exposure Results show that when the herb dill is grown for 2 weeks with daily 4-hour supplementary UV-
light, the horticultural produce improved 30% of its sensory quality from the situation at the outset towards the ‘gold standard’ This data was linked 
with the phenolic compounds profile in the dill, thereby revealing the potential of integrating metabolomics with highly innovative testing for culinary 
aspects Overall, this approach can lead to practical applications for the horticultural industry that benefits both producers and consumers, while 
also contributing to the basic understanding of the concept of crop quality

Metabolomics analysis of high cell density erythroblast cultures: Small molecules trigger cellular oxidative stress
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Joan S. Gallego M., Delft University of Technology - Sanquin, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Joan S. Gallego M., Nurcan Yagci, Angelo D’Alessandro, Emile van den Akker, Aljoscha Wahl, Marieke von Lindern
Transfusion-ready erythrocytes can be cultured from hematopoietic progenitors but at market-incompatible high costs A limitation in maximum cell 
density, 2 x 10^6 cells/mL, has been observed during in vitro erythroblast expansion Understanding the origin of this cell density limitation may 
provide strategies, both at media composition and feeding regime levels, to facilitate economically feasible upscaling Growth-limiting conditioned 
media from proliferating cells cultured with varying levels of cell densities, 07 - 15 x 10^6 cells/mL, were generated Media reconstitution 
experiments, performed by separating fresh media and growth-limiting supernatants using a 3kDa cut-off, and testing the effect of the filtrates 
and retentates on expanding erythroblasts, indicated that small molecules (<3kDa) are responsible for growth limitation Targeted and untargeted 
metabolomics measurements during 36 hours of culture, for both the intra- and extracellular compartments, indicated progressive degradation 
of nucleosides and a strong depletion of essential lipids and amino acids in the medium, and an intracellular decrease in intermediates of the 
glutathione-ascorbate, γ-glutamyl and cysteine-methionine cycles The latter pathways are involved in glutathione metabolism, a key intracellular 
antioxidant Dilution of growth-limiting media suggests that, in addition to potential inhibitors, depletion of nutrients could be limiting growth To 
identify potential depleted metabolites, growth-limiting media was supplemented with the components of fresh medium Following a one-factor-at-
a-time experimental design, components in the basal media IMDM were found to partially restore growth Current experiments aim to optimize the 
medium and/or genetically adapt metabolic pathways to enable erythroblasts to grow at high cell density, and at low cost

Ion mobility - MS based workflow for fast untargeted metabolite profiling
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Endre Laczko, FGCZ / ETH Zurich, Switzerland
CO-AUTHORS: Junmin Hu, Sebastian Streb
The potential of metabolomics to support personalised and translational, evidence based medicine is anticipated for quite some time A variety of 
research laboratories have already demonstrated successfully that metabolomics can provide data to support personalized and evidence based 
medical decisions However, no workflow was presented by the metabolomics research community yet which has the quality of point-of-care 
analytical testing approved and in use all over the world in medical practice The lack of robust, reproducible and fast metabolite quantification 
workflows from start to end prevents metabolomics to step into day to day clinical applications In this applied context, a metabolomics 
methodology has to fulfil several criteria: 1) Fast and robust metabolite extractions 2) Fast and robust metabolite measurements and quantifications 
3) Fast and standardized data analysis 4) Simple and intuitive data documentation We have investigated in our laboratory the potential of ion 
mobility - mass spectrometry (IM-MS) workflows to close this quality gap Here we like to present a point-of-care compatible IM-MS workflow as well 
as experimental data to demonstrate the speed and robustness of metabolite quantification by an untargeted metabolomics method

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sotirios Katsikis, University of Athens, Greece
CO-AUTHORS: Karolos Eleftherakos, Eleftherios A. Petrakis, Leandros A. Skaltsounis, Maria Halabalaki
Skin secretions of Amphibians are a unique and fascinating source of various bioactive natural compounds, like small peptides, alkaloids, and 
biogenic amines In order to describe and explain differences between species, populations and specimens but also to find specific biomarkers, 
a metabolomics profiling of the skin secretion of the Greek endemic Lyciasalamandra helverseni and Lyciasalamandra luschani basoglui 
(Salamandridae family) was carried out These species are found in the Aegean islands of Karpathos, Kasos and Kastellorizo, from where the 
samples were sourced The metabolomics analysis was carried out using LC-HRMS (Orbitrap) and the pre-processing of data was performed with 
mzMine v239 and XCMS v15 with IPO parameter optimization The preprocessed data were then used to create multivariate statistical models 
using SIMCA (v141) An evident separation in all taxon subdivisions was observed by employing unsupervised PCA The supervised PLS-DA, OPLS-
DA and O2PLS-DA models built were also able to reveal markers for identifying population differences MS^n experiments of a selection of m/z 
were further utilized to assist with compound annotation, along with 2D NMR (HSQC and HMBC) of selected pooled samples Evidence concerning 
novel elements of the species alkaloid arsenal is also presented Acknowledgment: The present work was co-funded by the European Union (ERDF) 
and Greek national funds through the Operational Program “Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation”, under the call “STRENGTHENING 
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION INFRASTRUCTURES” (project code: 5002803)

Assessing the use of Dried Blood Spot technologies for metabolomics research
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nathan Lawler, Edith Cowan University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Mary C Boyce, Stacey N Reinke, David I Broadhurst
Typically, for blood-based metabolomics studies, whole blood is collected via venepuncture with plasma or serum being processed and biobanked 
for later analysis This approach requires trained personnel and specialised laboratory equipment, so is generally limited to the laboratory or clinical 
setting Moreover, venepuncture is often considered too invasive for applications requiring multiple repeat sampling within a short time The use 
of dried blood spots (DBS) as an alternative collection method provides the advantage of reducing invasiveness, collection volume, and allowing 
collection to take place outside of the laboratory Despite these advantages, there has been very limited adoption of DBS technology due to limited 
metabolite coverage, together with poor analytical stability and reproducibility Recently, some of these limitations have potentially been resolved 
with improved collection technology; however, these methods have not yet been rigorously tested using high-resolution platforms In this study, two 
different DBS technologies (hemaPen™ and hemaSpot™) were compared against traditional venepuncture Blood samples were collected, using the 
three different methods, from six healthy adult participants Samples were prepared and data were acquired using a standard blood LC-Orbitrap-
MS workflow Raw files were processed using Thermo Compound Discoverer v30 Metabolite coverage was assessed based on the number of 
identifications made using an in-house authentic chemical reference library as well as open-access spectral databases Metabolite stability was 
assessed based on the percentage of metabolites present in DBS samples versus venepuncture samples Analytical reproducibility was assessed 
using calculation of relative standard deviation of signal The results of these comparisons will be presented

NMR in large-scale epidemiology
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Heli Salmela, Nightingale Health, Finland
CO-AUTHORS: Salla Ruosaari, Peter Würtz
Background: Advances in metabolomics now allow comprehensive biomarker profiling of entire biobanks and clinical trials This provides a plethora 
of scientific opportunities such as discovery of novel biomarkers for onset of cardiovascular diseases and tracking their progression, as well as 
etiological insights into established cardiometabolic risk factors Methods: Nightingale Health Ltd has developed a high-throughput metabolomics 
platform for population-wide initiatives and screening programs, and it is now being applied to profile close to 1000000 biobanked blood samples 
with extensive electronic health care records, including the entire collection of the UK Biobank with 500000 samples While reflecting the 
combined effects of lifestyle, environment and genetics, metabolomics provides a powerful tool for monitoring the health of individual patients or 
study participants over time Here, we display the selection of the established and the most promising novel NMR biomarkers for disease events 
and risk prediction, focusing on how analyzing large cohorts facilitates biomarker discovery We highlight cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, 
but also demonstrate how NMR metabolomics can be used in various smaller intervention studies and, for example, in research on gut microbiome 
and gut diseases Conclusions: Here we showcase the benefits of metabolomic profiling in large-scale epidemiological settings for improved risk 
stratification These results demonstrate how NMR metabolomics produces enhanced cardiovascular and diabetes risk prediction, allows novel 
means to track effectiveness of interventions and gives promise of future biomarker discovery for several chronic diseases

Metabolites from human odour and textiles applying thermal desorption and GC×GC-TOFMS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Paulina de la Mata, University of Alberta, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Sara Vaezafshar, Rachel H. McQueen, James J. Harynuk
The relationship between human odour on different types of fabric is important in the textile industry because if differences in the generation 
and retention of body odour on fabrics can be controlled, it will be possible to make high performance garments that will require less frequent 
washing Reduced laundering will extend the lifetime of the garment, and reduce the consumption of water and energy The retention of molecules 
(metabolites) by fabrics depends on the distinct properties of the fabric, including its type and any applied finishes Performance apparel is designed 
to draw moisture from the inside to the outside of the fabric for quick drying and wearer comfort This study presents the results of an extensive 
investigation into the chemical analysis of metabolites of human body odour T-shirt samples of five different fabric types worn by volunteers during 
at least one hour of physical activity for up to 20 wear and wash cycles were studied Fabric samples were analyzed by direct thermal desportion 
(TD) of the fabric with separation and detection of the molecules effected by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry (GC×GC TOFMS) Chemometric tools were used to study the differences observed between fabric types (cotton, polyester, and a 
cotton/polyester blend) and finishes on cotton fabrics

Charles E. Wade, Óttar Rolfsson, Pär I. Johansson
Objective: Investigate the endothelial cell phenotype(s) that causes Shock-Induced Endotheliopathy (SHINE) in trauma Background: We have 
studied more than 2,750 trauma patients and identified that patients with high circulating syndecan-1(endothelial glycocalyx damage marker) in 
plasma have an increased mortality rate compared to patients with lower levels Notably, we found that patients suffering from the same trauma 
severity could develop significantly different degrees of endothelial dysfunction as measured by syndecan-1 Methods: Prospective observational 
study of 20 trauma patients admitted to a Level 1 Trauma Centre and 20 healthy controls Admission plasma syndecan-1 level and mass 
spectrometry were measured and analyzed by computational network analysis of our genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the microvascular 
endothelial cell function Results: Trauma patients had a significantly different endothelial metabolic profile compared to controls Among the 
patients, four phenotypes were identified Three phenotypes were independent of syndecan-1 levels We developed GEMs representative of the 
observed phenotypes Within these phenotypes, we observed differences in the cell fluxes from glucose and palmitate to produce Acetyl-CoA, and 
secretion of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (component of syndecan-1) Conclusions: We confirm that trauma patients have a significantly different 
metabolic profile compared to controls A minimum of four SHINE phenotypes were identified, which were independent of syndecan-1level (except 
one phenotype) verifying that the endothelial response to trauma is heterogeneous and most likely driven by a genetic component Moreover, we 
introduced a new research tool in trauma by using metabolic systems biology, laying the foundation for personalized medicine

Advances and future perspectives in Eco-Metabolomics: From fingerprints to molecular mechanisms
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kristian Peters, Biochemistry of Plant Interactions, IPB Halle, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Treutler H, Marr S, Balcke G, Döll S, Gorzolka K, van Dam NM, Neumann S
Eco-Metabolomics is the application of metabolomics to ecology and biodiversity research to understand fundamental mechanisms regarding 
interactions of organisms with the environment, other organisms and within species communities Ecological experiment designs that are often 
carried out in fields require a large number of samples to control the high variability of metabolite profiles The focus on a broad range of non-model 
species that may never have been subjected to metabolite profiling before results in biochemically highly diverse profiles Thus, major challenges 
include a wealth of data resulting from multi-level experiment design factors and a multitude of novel substances (“unknown unknowns”) Here, 
we give an overview on current challenges in Eco-Metabolomics and present major advances The large data generated by Eco-Metabolomics 
experiments necessitate the integration of advanced statistical approaches to pinpoint metabolite features that explain the underlying research 
question most significantly Feature selection methods can be used to perform subsequent identification only of the most relevant features using 
targeted in vitro methods like MS2/MS3, NMR or by applying in silico tools like MetFrag Finally, we explain how annotating compound classes  
(eg using MetFamily and ClassyFire) represents a major breakthrough to describe molecular mechanisms in ecology and biodiversity research

Ion Mobility Spectrometry paired with 13C Enrichment Strategies for Improved Metabolite Identification
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Robin Kemperman, University of Florida, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Chris W.W. Beecher, Timothy J. Garrett, Richard A. Yost
Ion mobility (IM) is a rapid gas-phase separation technique that can separate isobars that are unresolved by LC-MS The combination of LC-
IM-MS has shown great potential for metabolomics applications because of the ability to deconvolute complex samples and perform structure 
elucidation, in addition to calculate collision cross sections (CCS) of each metabolite based on their measured IM drift times (DT) In this study we 
have implemented a unique isotopic labeling technique into our LC-IM-MS metabolomics workflow for higher accuracy and confidence in metabolite 
identification Isotopic ratio outlier analysis (IROA) uses the 13C enriched signal of all biochemically-synthesized metabolites in yeast, using a 5% 
or 95% 13C randomly labeled glucose in the cell media IROA produces characteristic isotopologues which confirm biological origin, number of 
carbons, and removes artifacts IROA is a powerful method for metabolic profiling; however, many isobars and isomers remain unresolved and the 
addition of numerous isotope signals increases the complexity of spectra IM helps resolve overlapping IROA patterns and increases the confidence 
in metabolite identification; moreover, mass spectra show increased S/N ratios in the LC-IM-MS scans compared to LC-MS scans Fragments of 
IROA-labeled metabolites maintain the IROA signature which aids in identification, however, due to low abundances are not always detected For 
example, Arginine eluted at RT=07 min, with an appropriate IROA pattern (m/z range of 1751196-1811401); however, it’s in-source fragments were 
hidden in the noise After IM-filtering at DT=161 ms, 5 different IROA patterns belonging to arginine fragments were detected

Recent advances in metabolomics have enabled larger proportions of the human metabolome to be analyzed quantitatively A significant 
contribution to this field includes the chemical derivatization of metabolites and the use of isotope-coded derivatization (ICD) Chemical 
derivatization allows in principle a wide coverage in a single method, as it affects both the separation and detection of metabolites: it increases 
retention, stabilizes and improves the sensitivity of the analytes Here, we describe a derivatization technique which simultaneously labels 
carboxylic acids, thiols and amines using the reagent dimethylaminophenacyl bromide (DmPABr) We further improve the quantitation by employing 
ICD, which uses internal standards derivatized with an isotopically-labelled reagent (DmPABr-D6) We demonstrate the ability to measure and 
quantify 64 central carbon and energy-related metabolites including amino acids, N-acetylated amino acids, metabolites from the TCA cycle and 
pyruvate metabolism, acylcarnitines and medium-/long-chain fatty acids To demonstrate the applicability of the analytical approach, we analyzed 
SUIT-2 cells utilizing a 15-minute single UPLC-MS/MS method in positive ionization mode SUIT-2 cells exposed to rotenone showed definitive 
changes in 28 out of the 64 metabolites, including metabolites from all 7 classes mentioned This method provides broad coverage of the human 
metabolome and quantification of amines, carboxylic acids and thiol-containing metabolites

Educating the Next Generation – a Framework for Introducing HRMS and Metabolomics into Undergraduate Curricula
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Stacey Reinke, Edith Cowan University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Nathan G Lawler, Yingqi Tu, Mary C Boyce
Over the last decade the growth in metabolomics research has been exponential This has been paralleled by increased educational opportunities 
at and above the postgraduate level However, any acceleration in the knowledge economy inevitably creates a vacuum of essential skills in the 
next generation of potential scientists Currently, topics such as high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), cheminformatics and data science are 
extremely limited in most undergraduate education curricula This needs to be rectified to ensure the stable growth of metabolomics Implementing 
metabolomics content into curricula is challenging as it must both meet certain pedagogical requirements, whilst being integrated into a diverse 
number of existing undergraduate courses For example, understanding HRMS needs to be embedded into chemistry curricula; pathway mapping 
into biochemistry curricula; spectral deconvolution and database searching into data science curricula As a first step to addressing these issues, 
an authentic learning framework for the metabolomic analysis of blood, using HRMS, has been developed and effectively integrated into an
