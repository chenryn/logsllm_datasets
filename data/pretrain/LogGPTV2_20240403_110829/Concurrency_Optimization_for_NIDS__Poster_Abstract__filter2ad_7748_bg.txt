**Abstract:**
Nontargeted tissue metabolomics is a promising approach for assessing tumor-specific alterations and identifying biomarkers. This study developed a method for nontargeted metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Protocol optimization was achieved through systematic assessment of assay reproducibility, including analytical precision and technical reproducibility, for structurally annotated metabolites.

Comparison of porcine FFPE tissue with fresh-frozen samples revealed high overlap of metabolic features in both organic (>90%) and aqueous (>85%) extracts, indicating that polar and nonpolar metabolites are well-preserved in FFPE tissue. Notably, a significant proportion of features were exclusively detected in FFPE tissue, which could be attributed to N-methylated and N-formylated phosphatidylethanolamine species, suggesting headgroup-specific modifications during fixation.

Further evaluation of the impact of tissue size and fixation time on analyte recovery showed metabolite class-specific differences in detection abundance. For example, the recovery of specific lipids, such as phosphatidylinositols and acylcarnitines, remained largely unaffected, making these molecules potential biomarkers for future diagnostic applications.

The applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by analyzing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and corresponding nontumorous FFPE tissue samples. Clear phenotypic distinction was achieved based on their metabolomic profiles. Significantly altered metabolites between ccRCC and nontumorous FFPE samples showed considerable overlap (>20%) with those previously identified in fresh-frozen kidney tissue.

### P-277: Semi-Targeted Metabolite Profiling for Improved Cellular Bioprocessing Outcomes Utilizing a Dual Separation/Mass Spectrometer with Intelligent MSn Acquisition

**Presenting Author:** Amanda Souza, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Ioanna Ntai, Anson Pierce, Paul Gulde, Martin Samonig, John Brann, Christopher Elicone, Ralf Tautenhahn, Daniel Lopez Ferrer, Andreas Huhmer

**Abstract:**
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for the commercial production of recombinant therapeutic proteins. Optimization of cell culture medium and feeds is essential to achieve maximum product yield. Metabolomics analysis enables the rapid determination of nutrient limitations or metabolite buildup during cell culture.

To better understand the metabolic events affecting cell biomass and antibody titer, we designed a semi-targeted workflow to measure critical nutrients and discover previously unidentified metabolites. Separate cultures of CHO cells expressing the same recombinant antibody were supplemented with six different feeds, and extracellular metabolites were sampled at various time points.

Our analytical platform included a dual UHPLC system for RP and HILIC separation, increasing throughput and metabolome coverage, and the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid MS with AcquireX intelligent acquisition software for maximizing the number of metabolites interrogated by MS/MS. An in-house spectral library of 60 metabolites was constructed from authentic standards to ensure confident identification.

Differential analysis of cell media provided robust metabolic indicators of cell growth and antibody yield. The semi-targeted approach rapidly detected amino acid and vitamin depletion, correlating with improved titer in shorter times. Overlapping two LC separations reduced analysis time by 30% without compromising reproducibility or compound detection. This high-throughput semi-targeted workflow provides greater understanding for the rational design of cell media and feeds for improved biopharmaceutical production.

### P-278: An Iterative Approach Integrating Metabolomics with Sensory Science to Improve Horticultural Quality

**Presenting Author:** Victor Castro-Alves, Örebro University, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Irina Kalbina, Åsa Öström, Åke Strid, Tuulia Hyötyläinen

**Abstract:**
Integrating metabolomics with sensory studies can enhance the overall taste and aroma of horticultural produce. However, improvements in sensory quality have often been inferred from changes in specific metabolites, and the relationship between consumer perceptions and potential metabolites influencing sensory attributes remains unclear.

We propose an iterative approach to improve the sensory quality of horticultural produce by applying comprehensive metabolic characterization using GC-Orbitrap and LC-QTOFMS, and integrating the data with sensory data and growing conditions using advanced bioinformatics tools. Each round of data correlation leads to suggestions for improving crop production, which are then tested in cycles to develop an optimized production protocol.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we addressed the reduction in quality of herbs grown in greenhouses due to the lack of UV exposure. Results showed that when dill was grown with daily 4-hour supplementary UV-light for 2 weeks, its sensory quality improved by 30% compared to the initial condition, approaching the 'gold standard'. This data was linked with the phenolic compounds profile in the dill, revealing the potential of integrating metabolomics with innovative testing for culinary aspects.

Overall, this approach can lead to practical applications in the horticultural industry, benefiting both producers and consumers, and contributing to the basic understanding of crop quality.

### P-279: Metabolomics Analysis of High Cell Density Erythroblast Cultures: Small Molecules Trigger Cellular Oxidative Stress

**Presenting Author:** Joan S. Gallego M., Delft University of Technology - Sanquin, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Nurcan Yagci, Angelo D’Alessandro, Emile van den Akker, Aljoscha Wahl, Marieke von Lindern

**Abstract:**
Transfusion-ready erythrocytes can be cultured from hematopoietic progenitors, but at market-incompatible high costs. A limitation in maximum cell density (2 x 10^6 cells/mL) has been observed during in vitro erythroblast expansion. Understanding the origin of this limitation may provide strategies to facilitate economically feasible upscaling.

Growth-limiting conditioned media from proliferating cells cultured at varying cell densities (0.7 - 15 x 10^6 cells/mL) were generated. Media reconstitution experiments, performed by separating fresh media and growth-limiting supernatants using a 3kDa cut-off, indicated that small molecules (<3kDa) are responsible for growth limitation. Targeted and untargeted metabolomics measurements over 36 hours of culture, for both intra- and extracellular compartments, indicated progressive degradation of nucleosides and strong depletion of essential lipids and amino acids in the medium, along with an intracellular decrease in intermediates of the glutathione-ascorbate, γ-glutamyl, and cysteine-methionine cycles, which are involved in glutathione metabolism, a key intracellular antioxidant.

Dilution of growth-limiting media suggests that, in addition to potential inhibitors, nutrient depletion could be limiting growth. To identify potential depleted metabolites, growth-limiting media was supplemented with components of fresh medium. Following a one-factor-at-a-time experimental design, components in the basal media IMDM were found to partially restore growth. Current experiments aim to optimize the medium and/or genetically adapt metabolic pathways to enable erythroblasts to grow at high cell density and low cost.

### P-280: Ion Mobility - MS Based Workflow for Fast Untargeted Metabolite Profiling

**Presenting Author:** Endre Laczko, FGCZ / ETH Zurich, Switzerland  
**Co-Authors:** Junmin Hu, Sebastian Streb

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics has the potential to support personalized and translational, evidence-based medicine. While several research laboratories have successfully demonstrated the utility of metabolomics, no workflow has yet been approved for point-of-care analytical testing in medical practice. The lack of robust, reproducible, and fast metabolite quantification workflows hinders the integration of metabolomics into clinical applications.

In this context, a metabolomics methodology must meet several criteria: 1) Fast and robust metabolite extraction, 2) Fast and robust metabolite measurement and quantification, 3) Fast and standardized data analysis, and 4) Simple and intuitive data documentation. We investigated the potential of ion mobility - mass spectrometry (IM-MS) workflows to address these challenges.

Here, we present a point-of-care compatible IM-MS workflow and experimental data demonstrating the speed and robustness of untargeted metabolomics methods for metabolite quantification.

**Presenting Author:** Sotirios Katsikis, University of Athens, Greece  
**Co-Authors:** Karolos Eleftherakos, Eleftherios A. Petrakis, Leandros A. Skaltsounis, Maria Halabalaki

**Abstract:**
Skin secretions of amphibians are a unique source of bioactive natural compounds, including small peptides, alkaloids, and biogenic amines. To describe and explain differences between species, populations, and specimens, and to find specific biomarkers, we conducted a metabolomic profiling of the skin secretion of the Greek endemic Lyciasalamandra helverseni and Lyciasalamandra luschani basoglui (Salamandridae family).

Samples were sourced from the Aegean islands of Karpathos, Kasos, and Kastellorizo. Metabolomic analysis was performed using LC-HRMS (Orbitrap), and data preprocessing was done with mzMine v2.39 and XCMS v1.5 with IPO parameter optimization. Multivariate statistical models were created using SIMCA (v14.1). Unsupervised PCA and supervised PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, and O2PLS-DA models revealed markers for identifying population differences.

MS^n experiments and 2D NMR (HSQC and HMBC) of selected pooled samples were used to assist with compound annotation. Evidence of novel elements in the species' alkaloid arsenal is presented. This work was co-funded by the European Union (ERDF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program "Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation" (project code: 5002803).

### P-282: Assessing the Use of Dried Blood Spot Technologies for Metabolomics Research

**Presenting Author:** Nathan Lawler, Edith Cowan University, Australia  
**Co-Authors:** Mary C Boyce, Stacey N Reinke, David I Broadhurst

**Abstract:**
Blood-based metabolomics studies typically require whole blood collected via venepuncture, with plasma or serum processed and biobanked for later analysis. This approach is limited to laboratory or clinical settings and is often too invasive for repeated sampling. Dried blood spots (DBS) offer a less invasive alternative, reducing collection volume and allowing collection outside the laboratory. However, DBS technology has been limited by poor metabolite coverage, analytical stability, and reproducibility.

This study compares two DBS technologies (hemaPen™ and hemaSpot™) against traditional venepuncture. Blood samples were collected from six healthy adult participants using the three methods, prepared, and analyzed using a standard blood LC-Orbitrap-MS workflow. Raw files were processed using Thermo Compound Discoverer v3.0. Metabolite coverage was assessed based on in-house and open-access spectral databases. Metabolite stability and analytical reproducibility were also evaluated.

Results from these comparisons will be presented, providing insights into the potential of DBS technologies for metabolomics research.

### P-283: NMR in Large-Scale Epidemiology

**Presenting Author:** Heli Salmela, Nightingale Health, Finland  
**Co-Authors:** Salla Ruosaari, Peter Würtz

**Abstract:**
Advances in metabolomics now allow comprehensive biomarker profiling of entire biobanks and clinical trials, providing opportunities for discovering novel biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases and tracking their progression. Nightingale Health Ltd. has developed a high-throughput metabolomics platform for population-wide initiatives and screening programs, currently being applied to profile nearly 1,000,000 biobanked blood samples, including the entire UK Biobank collection of 500,000 samples.

Metabolomics, reflecting the combined effects of lifestyle, environment, and genetics, is a powerful tool for monitoring the health of individual patients or study participants over time. Here, we present established and promising novel NMR biomarkers for disease events and risk prediction, focusing on how large cohort analysis facilitates biomarker discovery. We highlight cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and demonstrate the application of NMR metabolomics in smaller intervention studies and research on gut microbiome and gut diseases.

These results demonstrate enhanced cardiovascular and diabetes risk prediction, novel means to track the effectiveness of interventions, and the promise of future biomarker discovery for chronic diseases.

### P-284: Metabolites from Human Odour and Textiles Applying Thermal Desorption and GC×GC-TOFMS

**Presenting Author:** Paulina de la Mata, University of Alberta, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Sara Vaezafshar, Rachel H. McQueen, James J. Harynuk

**Abstract:**
Understanding the relationship between human odour and different types of fabric is important for the textile industry. Controlling the generation and retention of body odour on fabrics can lead to high-performance garments that require less frequent washing, extending garment lifetime and reducing water and energy consumption.

This study presents the results of an extensive investigation into the chemical analysis of metabolites of human body odour. T-shirt samples of five different fabric types, worn by volunteers during at least one hour of physical activity for up to 20 wear and wash cycles, were analyzed. Fabric samples were subjected to direct thermal desorption (TD) with separation and detection by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC TOFMS). Chemometric tools were used to study the differences between fabric types (cotton, polyester, and a cotton/polyester blend) and finishes on cotton fabrics.

### P-285: Metabolic Systems Analysis of Shock-Induced Endotheliopathy (SHINE) in Trauma – A New Research Paradigm

**Presenting Author:** Hanne Hee Henriksen, Section for Transfusion Medicine, Capital Region Blood Bank, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark  
**Co-Authors:** Sarah McGarrity, Rósa S. Sigurðardóttir, Travis Nemkov, Angelo D’Alessandro, Bernhard O. Palsson, Jakob Stensballe, Charles E. Wade, Óttar Rolfsson, Pär I. Johansson

**Abstract:**
Objective: Investigate the endothelial cell phenotypes causing Shock-Induced Endotheliopathy (SHINE) in trauma. Background: In a study of over 2,750 trauma patients, we identified that high circulating syndecan-1 (endothelial glycocalyx damage marker) levels in plasma correlate with increased mortality. Patients with the same trauma severity can develop significantly different degrees of endothelial dysfunction.

Methods: Prospective observational study of 20 trauma patients admitted to a Level 1 Trauma Centre and 20 healthy controls. Admission plasma syndecan-1 levels and mass spectrometry data were analyzed using computational network analysis of our genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of microvascular endothelial cell function.

Results: Trauma patients had a significantly different endothelial metabolic profile compared to controls. Four phenotypes were identified, three of which were independent of syndecan-1 levels. GEMs representative of the observed phenotypes showed differences in the cell fluxes from glucose and palmitate to produce Acetyl-CoA and the secretion of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (a component of syndecan-1).

Conclusions: We confirm that trauma patients have a significantly different metabolic profile compared to controls. At least four SHINE phenotypes were identified, verifying that the endothelial response to trauma is heterogeneous and likely driven by a genetic component. This study introduces a new research tool in trauma using metabolic systems biology, laying the foundation for personalized medicine.

### P-286: Advances and Future Perspectives in Eco-Metabolomics: From Fingerprints to Molecular Mechanisms

**Presenting Author:** Kristian Peters, Biochemistry of Plant Interactions, IPB Halle, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Treutler H, Marr S, Balcke G, Döll S, Gorzolka K, van Dam NM, Neumann S

**Abstract:**
Eco-Metabolomics applies metabolomics to ecology and biodiversity research to understand fundamental mechanisms of organism-environment interactions. Ecological experiment designs often require a large number of samples to control for high variability in metabolite profiles. The focus on non-model species results in biochemically diverse profiles, presenting major challenges in data management and the identification of novel substances ("unknown unknowns").

We provide an overview of current challenges in Eco-Metabolomics and present major advances. Advanced statistical approaches are necessary to pinpoint metabolite features that significantly explain the underlying research question. Feature selection methods can be used to perform subsequent identification of the most relevant features using targeted in vitro methods like MS2/MS3, NMR, or in silico tools like MetFrag. Annotating compound classes (e.g., using MetFamily and ClassyFire) represents a breakthrough in describing molecular mechanisms in ecology and biodiversity research.

### P-288: Ion Mobility Spectrometry Paired with 13C Enrichment Strategies for Improved Metabolite Identification

**Presenting Author:** Robin Kemperman, University of Florida, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Chris W.W. Beecher, Timothy J. Garrett, Richard A. Yost

**Abstract:**
Ion mobility (IM) is a rapid gas-phase separation technique that can resolve isobars unresolved by LC-MS. The combination of LC-IM-MS has shown great potential for metabolomics applications due to its ability to deconvolute complex samples and perform structure elucidation, in addition to calculating collision cross sections (CCS) based on measured IM drift times (DT).

In this study, we implemented a unique isotopic labeling technique into our LC-IM-MS metabolomics workflow for higher accuracy and confidence in metabolite identification. Isotopic ratio outlier analysis (IROA) uses 13C enriched signal from all biochemically-synthesized metabolites in yeast, using 5% or 95% 13C randomly labeled glucose in the cell media. IROA confirms biological origin, number of carbons, and removes artifacts. However, many isobars and isomers remain unresolved, and the addition of numerous isotope signals increases spectral complexity.

IM helps resolve overlapping IROA patterns and increases the confidence in metabolite identification, with increased S/N ratios in LC-IM-MS scans compared to LC-MS scans. Fragments of IROA-labeled metabolites maintain the IROA signature, aiding in identification. For example, arginine eluted at RT=0.7 min with an appropriate IROA pattern (m/z range of 175.1196-181.1401). After IM-filtering at DT=16.1 ms, 5 different IROA patterns belonging to arginine fragments were detected.

### P-289: Derivatization of Central Metabolites in SUIT-2 Cells Using Dimethylaminophenacyl Bromide Enabling LC-MS/MS Energy-State Analysis

**Presenting Author:** Cornelius Willacey, Analytical BioSciences and Metabolomics, Leiden University, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Martijn Naaktgeboren, Edinson Lucumi Moreno, Daan van der Es, Naama Karu, Ronan M. T. Fleming, Amy C. Harms, Thomas Hankemeier

**Abstract:**
Recent advances in metabolomics have enabled larger proportions of the human metabolome to be analyzed quantitatively. Chemical derivatization and isotope-coded derivatization (ICD) are significant contributions to this field. Derivatization affects both the separation and detection of metabolites, increasing retention, stability, and sensitivity.

Here, we describe a derivatization technique that simultaneously labels carboxylic acids, thiols, and amines using dimethylaminophenacyl bromide (DmPABr). We further improve quantitation by employing ICD, which uses internal standards derivatized with an isotopically-labeled reagent (DmPABr-D6). This method allows the measurement and quantification of 64 central carbon and energy-related metabolites, including amino acids, N-acetylated amino acids, TCA cycle metabolites, pyruvate metabolism, acylcarnitines, and medium-/long-chain fatty acids.

To demonstrate the applicability of the analytical approach, we analyzed SUIT-2 cells using a 15-minute single UPLC-MS/MS method in positive ionization mode. SUIT-2 cells exposed to rotenone showed definitive changes in 28 out of the 64 metabolites, including metabolites from all 7 classes mentioned. This method provides broad coverage of the human metabolome and quantification of amines, carboxylic acids, and thiol-containing metabolites.

### P-290: Educating the Next Generation – a Framework for Introducing HRMS and Metabolomics into Undergraduate Curricula

**Presenting Author:** Stacey Reinke, Edith Cowan University, Australia  
**Co-Authors:** Nathan G Lawler, Yingqi Tu, Mary C Boyce

**Abstract:**
Over the last decade, the growth in metabolomics research has been exponential, paralleled by increased educational opportunities at and above the postgraduate level. However, this growth creates a vacuum of essential skills in the next generation of scientists. Currently, topics such as high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), cheminformatics, and data science are limited in undergraduate education curricula, which needs to be rectified to ensure the stable growth of metabolomics.

Implementing metabolomics content into curricula is challenging as it must meet pedagogical requirements while being integrated into diverse undergraduate courses. For example, understanding HRMS needs to be embedded in chemistry curricula; pathway mapping in biochemistry curricula; and spectral deconvolution and database searching in data science curricula.

As a first step, an authentic learning framework for the metabolomic analysis of blood using HRMS has been developed and effectively integrated into an undergraduate course. This framework aims to provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge to contribute to the field of metabolomics.
