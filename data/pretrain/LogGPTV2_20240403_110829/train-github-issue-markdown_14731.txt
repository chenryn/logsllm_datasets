In one of our screens with Material Scaffold no AppBar is set and the body is
a ListView containing normal Flutter widgets and a WebView. The ListView is
wrapped in a SafeArea.
When scrolling up, as expected, the normal Flutter widgets are not visible
behind the statusbar. Unfortunately on iOS the WebView IS visible below the
statusbar. It seems like the padding given by SafeArea is not working for
WebViews/PlatformViews on iOS.
I created a simple version which you can see in attached gif.
