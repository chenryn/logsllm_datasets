Iâ€™m using the German ergonomic keyboard mapping Neo and Mac OS.
By default, Atom has several key bindings of the form `Alt+X` (`X` being a
letter). These correspond to special characters on my keyboard map, e.g.,
`Alt+F` (or, in Apple terms `Option F`) is `=`.
Expected behaviour:
  * The symbol is inserted.
Actual behaviour:
  * The key binding is triggered.
I suppose you could argue that this behaviour is not a bug; in this case I
urge you to reconsider the default bindings, since the current default
effectively blocks me (and other non-English keyboard users) from entering
various special characters.
