User: Implement an instant messaging system based on WebSocket technology, which supports multi-person chat and file transfer.
Assistant: To implement an instant messaging system based on WebSocket technology, the following steps need to be followed: 1. Design the system architecture: Considering the requirements of multi-person chat and file transfer, the system needs to be divided into two parts: server-side and client-side. The server needs to maintain the connection information and chat records of all users, and the client needs to provide an interface and logic for handling user behavior. 2. Choose a technology stack: WebSocket technology is a full-duplex communication protocol based on the TCP protocol, which reduces the overhead of HTTP requests, so Node.js is usually chosen as the server-side development language. Clients can choose modern JavaScript frameworks such as Vue or React for development. 3. Implement basic instant messaging functions: open WebSocket connection, send and receive messages, close connection, etc. These functions are the basis of message transmission. 4. Realize multi-person chat function: need to consider how to group users, keep chat records synchronized, and deal with users who have exited the chat room. 5. Realize the file transfer function: It is necessary to convert the file into a binary stream for transmission, and consider how to improve the transmission efficiency and ensure the security of the transmission. 6. Write test cases: It is necessary to write corresponding test cases to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system. 7. Deployment and release: deploy the system to the server and release it to users, so that users can use the realized multi-person chat and file transfer functions. In general, when implementing an instant messaging system based on WebSocket technology, it is necessary to focus on how to deal with the details of user connection and message transmission, and at the same time achieve ease of use and stability in user interface and function design.
