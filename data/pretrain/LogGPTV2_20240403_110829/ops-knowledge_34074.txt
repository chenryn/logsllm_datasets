User: I have Python 3.2.2 downloaded and have been using IDLE to execute code; however, I was wondering whether it is possible to have Python 3.2.2 run through Terminal as opposed to Python 2.6.1 on which it is currently running. 
How would I got about doing so? Would there be any bad side effects?
Assistant: No side effects, you can also use alias python3="/directory/where/python_binary" to get python3 as an shortcut to real python binary.
