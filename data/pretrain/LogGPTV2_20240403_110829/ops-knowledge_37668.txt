User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题CentOS - lm_sensors installation I need to install CentOS 5 server using kickstart installation.
As part of the installation, I need to install lm_sensors package.
When I'm installing lm_sensors manually, I'm running sensors-detect command.
But this command is requires an interaction with user.

What I need to do in order to make fully automatic CentOS installation with lm_sensors?

Thanks

Assistant: I think you can use a %post script for this:

%post --log=/root/sensors-detect.log
yes | sensors-detect


This thread at the lm-sensors mail list discusses this very issue. Piping yes seems to work, although it may not be the cleanest option.
