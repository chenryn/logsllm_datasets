field strength needs to meet certain requirements. The E field
interference on a touchscreen is shown in Fig. 6a. The critical
E field that is required to cause a ghost touch is defined as
Ecrit and can be calculated as follows. The detailed derivation
process can be found in Appendix C.
We assume VT n is the output voltage variation caused by
the IEMI noise. To generate the ghost touch, we need to fulfill
the following requirement, i.e.,
|VT n| ≥ |VT | = ∆C

where Qt = ∆C·Vc, representing the charge change caused by
the real touch. Solving (C-13), (C-15) and (9) simultaneously,
Ecrit =

Based on (10), if EZ is larger than Ecrit, a ghost touch is
successfully generated.
Simulation Validation of Touchscreen Response to Radi-
ated IEMI: Fig. 7a and 7b show the simulated Vo of a single
QT sensor under a finger touch and IEMI attack based on the
developed model, respectively. For this simulation, switches
S1-S3 are controlled with 100kHz signals as shown in Fig. 5.
All simulation parameters are listed in Table I. The touch event
is simulated using a positive 0.5 pF capacitance change. The
IEMI signal is simulated using a noise voltage source Vn at
the input of the QT sensor. Vth is set to 2.75 V. To cause a
ghost touch, Vn should meet the requirement in 11.

As shown in Fig. 7a, Vo changes when there is a finger touch
due to the change in capacitance. Once Vo exceeds Vth, a touch
event is recognized. Under the simulated IEMI attack (shown
in Fig. 7b), Vo exceeds Vth even when there is no touch. This
validates our QT sensor model analysis, and motivates our
subsequent experiments for generating ghost touch events in
real scenarios.

E. Relationship of IEMI Frequencies and a Successful Attack
From Section IV-D, we know that the E field strength will,
in part, decide the IEMI attack effectiveness. Nevertheless, as
shown in previous work [19], the frequency of the interfering
signal also plays a critical role. Therefore, we conduct the
following analysis to first reveal the relationship of IEMI
frequencies and a successful IEMI attack. Fig. 6b shows the
voltage source Vn which is the input voltage of the QT sensor
due to the IEMI attack. Based on the superposition theory,
we can derive the equivalent circuit of a QT sensor under an
IEMI attack where only the noise source Vn is considered
(see Fig. 8a). Rs is ignored since it is much smaller than the
impedance of CM.

The mathematical calculation of the minimum IEMI interfer-
ence that can cause a ghost touch event is thoroughly explained
in Appendix B. The calculation gives us the lower boundary of
IEMI attacks. In real attacks, we would like to maximize the
IEMI interference. A similar calculation process also applies.
The maximum interference can be achieved if one of the
following two conditions is met.
• Condition 1: The phase angle is φ0 = 3π
2 and the frequency
of the IEMI signal satisfies (B-9) and (12) simultaneously.

As we will show in Section V-D, by conducting several
experiments with a Chromebook equipped with a touchscreen
diagnostic data collection program, we confirm our developed
theory by identifying various frequencies at which ghost
touches are caused at the required minimum E field. The
impact of φ0 is minimized by finding the worst case in
multiple measurements at each frequency.
V. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT EVALUATION
In Section IV, we developed a theory for IEMI ghost touch
attacks and validated it using simulations. In this section,
we will demonstrate the IEMI attack using a relatively ideal
experiment setup by targeting a laptop with electrode plates
placed directly on both sides of the laptop touchscreen. With
this setup, we generate real experimental results to validate
our previous analysis, e.g., the required E field and needed
frequencies for effective IEMI attack signals.
A. Experimental Setup
As a proof-of-concept, we generate radiated IEMI using
electrode plates placed on opposite sides of our target de-
vice. A signal generator (RIGOL DS 1052E) and an RF
power amplifier (Amplifier Research 25A250A) are used to
generate the desired voltage. The output of the RF amplifier
is monitored by an oscilloscope (RIGOL MSO4054). The
touchscreen of a Chromebook laptop is used as the target. This
laptop is installed with Touch Firmware Tests [20] developed
by the Chromium Project. This program records all of the
touched positions recognized by the touchscreen controller
during the test. The recorded data is collected by an external
device over Wi-Fi. A test report is also generated that lists all
touched locations during the testing period. During the test,
the Chromebook is disconnected from the adapter and placed
on a non-conductive surface 70 cm above the ground to avoid
undesired EMI noise.
B. IEMI Generation
The E field parameters are selected based on our calcula-
tions in Section IV-E. Fig. 9 shows the placement of the two
electrode plates. Plate 1 is an 8 mm x 8 mm copper plate
taped on the front of the touchscreen. Plate 2 is a 150 mm x
150 mm copper plate taped on the back of the touchscreen.
The distances d between each plate and the touchscreen are
both 10 mm (see Fig. 9a). A non-conductive foam sheet is
inserted between the plates and the touchscreen for mechanical
support. The thickness t of the touchscreen itself is 5 mm. The
dielectric constant of the foam sheet is in the range of 1.8 -
3 [21]. To simplify the calculation of E field strength, Ez, we
use the following equation based on VE, the voltage across
the plates.
Ez =
VE
2d + t
(14)
Further, to validate the accuracy of (14), we compare our cal-
culated results with simulation results using Ansys HFSS [22].
Note that the simulation reflects the real configuration by
considering the foam sheet and the plate sizes. The HFSS uses
finite element analysis to solve Maxwell’s equation, thereby
providing accurate calculation results.
Fig. 9b shows the simulated E field on the touchscreen
caused by the two plates when VE = 15V . We found that
the magnitude of the simulated E field is approximately equal
to the calculated results using (14), which indicates that the
simplified (14) is a good estimate for the generated E field
strength. Hereafter, we will rely on (14) to derive the VE based
on the required Ez.

C. Evaluation of E Field Strength IEMI on Touchscreen Be-
havior to Validate Our Theory
To exclude possible interference from the electrode plates
affecting the touchscreen functionality, we first do not apply
voltage to the electrode plates and collect touchscreen diag-
nostic data by drawing a random pattern on the touchscreen
with a finger. This confirms that the touchscreen functions
normally.
Stationary IEMI attack: Once we confirm the electrodes
themselves have no impact on the touchscreen, we calculate
the required VE for an IEMI attack. We collect parameters for
a typical touchscreen from [13]. The minimum detectable ca-
pacitance change ∆C is 0.1 pF and the touchscreen controller
excitation signal Vin is 5 V. We also incorporate the overlap
area 8mm × 8mm due to the electrode. From (10), we have
Ecrit = 883V/m. Following (14), the corresponding VE is
calculated as 22 V.

Fig. 10: Ghost touch under an IEMI attack with (a) 20 V, 140 kHz and (b)
25 V 140 kHz voltage excitation VE.
We then set VE on the signal generator to be a sinusoidal
voltage source with a frequency of 140kHz. Instead of apply-
ing 22 V directly, the amplitude of VE is gradually increased
until a ghost touch is observed. The process is repeated three
times to find the minimum voltage that causes the ghost touch.
In our experiment, we do not detect ghost touches when VE
is lower than 20 V. When the voltage is higher than 20 V,
however, ghost touches start to appear. As shown in Fig. 10a,
a ghost touch is successfully generated at the center of plate
1 when VE is 20 V. Note that the required minimum VE for
ghost touches is close to our theoretical calculation (i.e., 22
V), showing that our analysis is accurate. When we increase

VE above 20 V, multiple ghost touches are observed. This is
because when the voltage is high compared to the minimum
VE, several locations under plate 1 (as opposed to just one)
have sufficiently high E field strengths to induce ghost touches.
Fig. 10b shows that two ghost touches are generated when VE
is 25 V.
Moving IEMI attack: We have demonstrated that the touch-
screen is vulnerable to stationary IEMI sources. We further
expand our experiment by moving our electrode plates around
to verify if only certain locations on the touchscreen are vul-
nerable. To account for jitter caused by moving the electrode
plates, we increase the applied VE to 30V / 140kHz (E field
strength of 1200V/m) to ensure the E field is always higher
than Ecrit. As shown in Fig. 11a, many ghost touch points
are evident when plate 1 moves from left to right. Fig. 11b
shows the ghost touch points when plate 1 moves from top
to bottom. The results show that all physical locations of the
touchscreen are equally vulnerable to an IEMI attack.
D. Evaluation of IEMI Frequencies on Touchscreen Behavior
to Validate Our Theory
As we mentioned in Section IV-E, the E field frequency
also impacts the IEMI attack in addition to its strength. We
therefore conduct several experiments to validate our analysis
on calculating the required signal frequencies for a successful
IEMI attack.
Sweeping IEMI Attack Frequencies to Validate Our The-
ory: From [17], [23], we know that the touchscreen system is
sensitive to noise in the range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz due
to integrated low pass filters in the touch sensing circuit.
We sweep the frequency from 10 kHz to 10 MHz to cover
the sensitive frequency range using steps of 10 kHz. With
each chosen frequency, we tune the voltage applied on the
two electrode plates until ghost touches are detected. If the
generated E field exceeds 3000V/m and there is still no
ghost touches detected, then we claim that the selected E field
frequency cannot generate a ghost touch. We run each test for
5 seconds and after each measurement reboot the Chromebook
to reset the touchscreen. The procedure is repeated three times
for each frequency. All collected results are plotted in Fig. 12
which shows a complete view of the frequency dependency for
successful IEMI attacks. As we can see in this figure, certain
excitation frequencies out-perform other frequencies (requires
smaller E field strength to trigger ghost touch), which validated
our previous theory of IEMI frequencies, see equation (12)
and (13).

Fig. 12: Minimum E field that causes the ghost touch at different frequencies
Targeted IEMI Attack Frequencies to Validate Our The-
ory: In Section IV-E, we show that fsw and Ds determine
the minimum/maximum IEMI interference using an E field
with frequency fE. These parameters can be calculated from
two adjacent frequencies with the maximum interference (local
lowest Ecrit). Using the results presented in Fig. 12, we select
two adjacent frequency points and derive fsw = 70kHz
and Ds = 0.125. Based on these calculations, we can then
derive all E field frequencies that can cause minimum IEMI
interference (denoted as fEmin) or maximum IEMI interfer-
ence (denoted as fEmax) using (B-6), (12) and (13). In the
frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 MHz, fEmax and fEmin
are listed as follows.
fEmax = 140 kHz, 420 kHz, 700 kHz, 980 kHz
fEmin = 560 kHz, 1120 kHz
Note that these calculated frequencies match the experimen-
tal results shown in Fig. 12. For frequencies other than fEmin
and fEmax, we can still obverse ghost touches with larger
than minimum E field strengths. It is worth noting that the
IEMI signal cannot cause any interference at 700 kHz. This
is likely caused by internal filters that are in place to avoid
undesired interference from internal electronics components
at those frequencies. For frequencies higher than 1 MHz,
the impact of the sensor circuit’s internal low pass filter and
parasitic parameters become more significant [23]. Since this
is often proprietary information of touchscreen manufacturers,
the experimental results become less consistent with our
calculations. When we set the frequency larger than 3.4 MHz,
no ghost touches are detected.
VI. PRECISE SCREEN CONTROL USING IEMI ATTACK
In modern touchscreen systems, the electrodes at the touch
sensor grid are scanned by the controller [13]. The controller
drives a single column (TX electrode) and scans every row
(RX electrode) as shown in Fig. 13a. The process is repeated
for every column so that the capacitance of all the electrodes
can be measured. For example, in Fig. 13a, column Y2 is being
driven and rows X1 to X4 are being sensed in sequence. When
the IEMI attack on the screen occurs at the moment when a
single pair of electrodes is being scanned (see Fig. 13b), it is
possible to generate a ghost touch at that specific location. A
ghost touch will be recognized at (X2, Y2) when IEMI occurs
while those electrodes are being sensed.

and (b) ghost touch on a precise location.
Generating an E field with a small focusing area is chal-
lenging. However, it is possible to generate a ghost touch at a
specific location on the screen without synchronizing with the
sense lines if the IEMI signal is generated with an appropriate
antenna using a short pulse. This essentially mimics a finger
touch event. In Section V, we use two copper plates which are
attached to the front and back of the victim device to generate
a focused small E field. Although such a setup is impractical
in real attack scenarios, we can use the same methodology
to design a new antenna, e.g., using two copper plates right
