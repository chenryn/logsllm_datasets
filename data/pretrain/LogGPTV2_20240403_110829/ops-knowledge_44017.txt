**Issue:** It appears that the problem with `pip` not working correctly is due to spaces in the Python installation path.

**Question:** How can I make `pip` work without having to reinstall everything in a directory without spaces?

**Solution:** I encountered the same issue on Windows 10, and after trying various solutions, the problem persisted. To resolve it, I uninstalled Python 2.7 and installed version 2.7.13, which resolved the issue completely. 

If you prefer not to change your Python version, another approach could be to modify the environment variables or use a virtual environment, which can help avoid issues related to spaces in the installation path.
