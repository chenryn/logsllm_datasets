User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: I had the same issue on windows 10, after trying all the previous solution the problem persists so I decided to uninstall my python 2.7 and install the version 2.7.13 and it works perfectly.
