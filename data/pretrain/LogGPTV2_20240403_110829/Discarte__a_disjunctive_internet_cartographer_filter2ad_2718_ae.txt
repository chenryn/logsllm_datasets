Address alignment would be trivial if record route implementa-
tions were standardized (and such standards were adhered to). We
believe the implementation diversity in record route (Section 3) ex-
ists because RFC 791 does not specify how to treat options on ex-
piring packets. For topology discovery, Arriving is the most appeal-
ing RR implementation, where addresses are recorded for expiring
packets. If this scheme were universal, an alias could be discovered
with a single packet.
A more powerful record-route option would include the ability to
“skip” a conﬁgurable number of addresses before starting to record.
In this way, successive RR probes could record 9 hop subsections
of a path, giving complete RR information from end to end, as op-
posed to the current 9 hop limit. Implementation is simple: routers
need only increment the RR array index pointer even if the RR ar-
ray is full, allowing the index to wrap. Thus, the sender sets the
initial RR pointer value to 4 − (4 × k) mod 256 to skip k hops
before starting to record the route. Recall that a router along the
path only records the route if the pointer value p is in the range
4 ≤ p < l where l is the length of the RR option in the IP header.
11. CONCLUSION
Internet topology measurement faces a continuing problem of
scale: more nodes and links are added, measurement platforms like
PlanetLab grow, and ﬁltering policies and implementations remain
diverse. To capture this topology requires not simply the ability to
collect, store, and query against the 1.3 billion response packets in
our data set, but also the ability to ﬁlter this data to discern which
observations and interpretations are valid. Toward this goal, we
adopted disjunctive logic programming to merge our expectations
of network engineering practice—common vendor choice and ad-
dress preﬁx assignment—to interpret and merge our topology data.
DisCarte provides a novel cross-validation tool for network topol-
ogy discovery—it ﬁnds aliases that increasingly cannot be detected
by active probing (30% of addresses we found could not be probed),
it ﬁnds routers that do not decrement TTL (329) or generate ICMP
errors (2,440), it veriﬁes that probed paths are consistent during a
measurement—but extracting this information requires signiﬁcant
effort. Expectations of network engineering practice provide the
hints required to interpret this data accurately, and a divide-and-
conquer approach allows the ﬂexible interpretation to take place
quickly over subsets of the data and resolve contradictions.
Our effort owes its inspiration to Vern Paxson’s Strategies for
Sound Internet Measurement [31]. Our approach that led to Dis-
Carte is to measure the same path and topology using two different
methods so that their consistency can ensure an accurate result (one
of Paxson’s “calibration” strategies). Along the way, we adopted
many of his hints: study small components ﬁrst (the PlanetLab
topology before the Internet; small cliques before larger ones), in-
vest in visualization (we used neato and dot [13] to compare topolo-
gies), build test suites (our regression tests include 77 difﬁcult-to-
interpret traces and groups of traces), and we make available our
data and analysis scripts.

Our future work is to develop two related components: an application-
speciﬁc version of our (inefﬁcient but general-purpose) DLP-based
solver, and a more efﬁcient measurement interpretation scheduler
that would choose to study related measurements together to re-
duce the computational requirements of the analysis. In this ﬁrst
application of record route in topology measurement, getting the
right answer took precedence over performance; making the mea-
surements and analysis efﬁcient enough to be repeated will take
engineering.
