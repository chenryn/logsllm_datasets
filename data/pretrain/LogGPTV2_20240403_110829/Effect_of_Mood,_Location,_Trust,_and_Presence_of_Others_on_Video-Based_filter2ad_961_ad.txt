counted for 70% of the responses). The most frequently cited
reason for agreeing to help was “the length of time the partic-
ipant knew the other person,” followed by their “conﬁdence
in their ability to recognize that person effectively” and “they
are responsive when I ask them to help me” (see Table 8).

Table 9: Reasons for declining video chat, sorted by frequency
4.8 Reasons for Declining
When participants opted to decline to an ESM prompt to au-
thenticate via video chat, we also asked reasons for declining.
The most common reason they provided was that they were
“busy” (59% for initiate and 65% for help; see Table 9). The
percentage of “busy” was consistent across the four-week pe-
riod (52.3%, 69.3%, 65.6%, 58.7%, respectively). The other
common reasons included “I don’t want to” and “I’m not in
a location to use video chat”. Participants also gave more
“other” explanations (5% vs. 2%) when they were prompted
to help versus initiate.
4.9 Post-Survey Results
In general, participants self-reported that they were comfort-
able with interacting through video chats (M = 2.2, SD = 1.1).
Only 10% of the participants reported that they disagreed
or strongly disagreed that they were comfortable interact-
ing through video chats in general. When we asked about
seeking authentication from another person through video
chat, they were still relatively comfortable (M = 2.8, SD = 1).
About 23.3% of the participants reported that they disagreed
or strongly disagreed that they were comfortable seeking au-
thentication through video chats. The majority of participants
also had fun helping others (M = 2.5, SD = 1.1), would have
liked seeing the other person on video chats when helping
them (M = 2.6, SD = 1.2), and liked the opportunity to help
other people (M = 2.3, SD = 1.2).
5 Discussion and Implications
We explored people’s perceived willingness to use video chat
as an alternative social authentication method. Furthermore,
we explored the contextual factors that may affect people’s
perceived willingness to use such authentication. Our results
suggest that people are, in general, willing to use video chat as
a social authentication method. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that trust
in other people, location, mood, and the presence of others are
factors that could potentially affect people’s perceived will-
ingness to use social authentication. We included participants’
quotes in the discussion, which are illustrative sources. The
primary data was from the ESM questionnaires. The quotes
just helped us to further interpret the data we saw from the
logistic regression models.
5.1 Use Video-Based Social Authentication in
a Small Group of People Who Know Each
Other Well
Video-based social authentication differs from general video
chat, in which the motivation for participation is usually the
desire for closeness [56]. For video-based social authentica-
tion, for people who initiate the authentication, the motivation
is usually the singular desire to get authenticated when pri-
mary authentication fails. For example, “I think a veriﬁcation
through video chat is very secure if I cannot get access to
the app and my family or friends can help me out.” (P4).
For people who help the authentication, the most commonly
cited reasons for agreeing to help are “Length of time we’ve
known each other” and “I know I would recognize them effec-
tively.” Examples included, “Only because it’s Alice” (P19)1
and “Cause I like to help people and think I would recognize
her” (P11). Our study shows that the motivation of people
participating in video-based social authentication is very dif-
ferent from participating in general video chats.
When participants declined to video chat to authenticate,
the reason they most often gave was that they were busy. It
was not lacking of ability (e.g., only 1 – 2% of the time was
the reason a technical issue) or because of trust or familiarity
issues (1 – 2% of the time) that participants declined (see
Table 9), but rather because they were unable to since they
were already engaged in other activities. It is also worth noting
that under the circumstances of the study, participants were
queried at random times, but under actual conditions, they

would be initiating themselves, not via a prompt. Thus, it is
likely that participants would be more willing to initiate since
they would be likely available to do so.
Furthermore, when a person was asked to help and they
declined, they gave substantive reasons for not helping instead
of just saying that they did not want to (20% for initiate, see
Table 9). This indicates that to not seem unhelpful or selﬁsh,
individuals want to clarify that it is not just that they “do not
want to” help, but instead, they are sick, sleeping, or just do
not know the person well enough to have a video chat for
authentication.
These ﬁndings are in contrast to prior work on friendsourc-
ing questions on Twitter, for example, which found that some
participants found “friendsourcing anything at all was too
onerous” [76]. While we can only speculate on the reasons
for the differences in ﬁndings, there are some possible reasons
behind these differences. For example, in our study, we did
not offer any ﬁnancial incentives for participants to either ini-
tiate or help. Sometimes ﬁnancial incentives are a disincentive
to participation [76]. Another possible reason is that in our
study, participants only had to reach out to one member of
their social network groups rather than their entire network
of Twitter followers.
Our results show that social authentication, such as the
video-based authentication we propose here, may beneﬁt from
existing social ties (relationships between people to share in-
formation, feelings, knowledge, and experience [30]). Partici-
pants who already know each other beneﬁt not only from the
ability to recognize each other, they are also willing to help
each other. This ﬁnding is consistent with the near-perfect
correlation between in-person trust and whether participants
knew each other prior to the study (see Section 4.6). It is
also consistent with the results generated from the logistic
regression model (see Table 7), suggesting that trust is an
efﬁcient predictor of people’s perceived willingness to help
with a video-based authentication. People tend to help people
they know and trust. For example, more than half of social
network users self-reported that they had asked questions on
social networks to get help [70]. Even when there are social
costs to helping friends, people are still willing to help [76].
When participants agreed to initiate a video-based authen-
tication, they were also more likely to choose someone they
already knew (see Section 4.5). Participants reported conﬁ-
dence in their ability to recognize the person requesting help,
which suggests the individual may experience a sense of ac-
complishment and self-conﬁdence because of their abilities to
succeed at the task of authentication. This is consistent with
previous studies that people are more easily able to recognize
familiar faces than unfamiliar faces [17, 20].
Our results also suggest that individuals may beneﬁt from
using video chat as an additional opportunity for social in-
teraction since another motivating factor was that it gave the
participant a sense of personal accomplishment stemming
from assisting others. We interpret this based on the fact that
some of the participants wanted to “be helpful”. Boredom is
also a factor, as it was mentioned multiple times by partici-
pants. For example: “I’m bored, so why not?” (P15) or “I’m
not busy right now.” (P3). This comment, while not speciﬁ-
cally mentioning boredom, is related since the participant did
not have anything else going on that might prevent her from
engaging in a video chat. Since they could have still chosen
to ignore the prompt but did not, it suggests that people would
welcome the opportunity to interact socially via this form of
authentication. This is similar to other online social activi-
ties such as social questions and answers [33, 70, 79], where
people ask for help, and others help when available.
These ﬁndings indicate that using video chat as fallback
authentication, especially within a small group of people who
know and trust each other (e.g., family and close friends), is
potentially feasible.
5.2 Use Location and Mood Detection for
Video-Based Social Authentication Sys-
tems
Our results show that when individuals were at home and
when they were alone, they agreed to initiate and help more
often. This differentiates video-based social authentication
from general video chat at home, where, for example, video
chat with family or friends often involves multiparty inter-
actions [56]. In other single party video chats, for example,
people who use video chats at a long distance often use other
techniques such as an instant message to check if the partner
is in a location that is good for video chats ﬁrst [3,54,72]. But
as we discussed earlier, in our study, participants received ran-
dom prompts. Our study reveals that location is one of the key
factors for video-based social authentication. For example,
“while I think it is a very secure way to verify who someone
is, sometimes I did not have the ﬂexibility or availability to
verify anyone in my network right when they needed me. I was
often in meetings, driving in my car, or coaching hockey for
my children and did not see the texts until much later.” (P25).
In real-world situations, people may be able to connect
with each other in advance to enhance the response rate and
response time of the video-based social authentication. Previ-
ous research has used location as a contextual factor to adapt
the form of authentication [5,44,59]. Our paper extends these
works to further suggest that video-based social authentica-
tion may be most appealing as an option when people are
at home and alone. Future video-based social authentication
could use location detection to help people choose whom to
ask for help in getting authenticated.
As we expected, a pleasant mood was associated with par-
ticipants being willing to authenticate via video chat. What
is not clear is the directionality of this relationship. Is it that
participants who were in a more pleasant mood already were
willing to use video chat to authenticate? Or is it that when
participants reported that they would agree to help with a
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    11
friend to authenticate via a video chat put them in a more
pleasant mood? Research on social networking-based chat
services indicates that messages between members of a so-
cial network group can increase feelings of well-being and
connectedness [19].
Furthermore, research on altruism and helping behaviors
suggest that when people help others, it may improve their
own mood [8,39]. If participants realized this, they have been
more, instead of less likely to respond when they were in a
pleasant mood. However, if participants were worried about
how their negative effects may affect others, they might have
been less willing to authenticate via video chat. One partici-
pant’s response sheds some light: “I’m grumpy in the morn-
ing, and I don’t think I would be very enjoyable to video chat
with right now.” (P9). This comment suggests that existing
mood affects the willingness to use video chat for authen-
tication, and also demonstrates a recognition that the other
person would be negatively affected by their unpleasant mood
as well. Future video-based social authentication systems
could consider integrating wearable devices that detect mood
(e.g., [25, 92]) if designers wanted to use mood as a decision
criterion for choosing notaries.
5.3 Potential Pitfalls and Solutions for Video-
Based Social Authentication Systems
5.3.1 Interaction and attractiveness
Our results reveal that people in video-based social authenti-
cation maybe not only be motivated by helping one another
but may also be motivated by the interaction with others as a
beneﬁcial form of social contact. This is similar to one of the
motivations of friendsourcing, which is connecting to social
networks [11]. In addition, participants also sometimes re-
ported that when they were willing to help, the reasons were
because: they wanted additional contact with the other person
(11%), they thought the other person was attractive (11%), or
the appearance of other people as happy or friendly (4%). For
example, “He has a nice smile!” (P26). One participant even
combined these reasons boldly, saying, “Honestly, I’m only
willing to help them because they’re hot, that’s why I want
more contact with them.” (P10). This participant wanted more
contact with the other participants because they perceived
them as attractive. They thought of the simulated authentica-
tion opportunity as a way to achieve more contact.
Our ﬁnding that some people reported they were motivated,
at least in part, by how attractive the chat initiator was, is not
surprising or unique. People who are physically attractive
beneﬁt from many advantages. For example, attractive people
are paid more, get higher fringe beneﬁts [27], are more highly
trusted [22, 40], are able to charge higher prices for Airbnb
listings [49], are more likely to be elected to public ofﬁce [55],
and perform better in high school and university [23,31]. One
reason for these beneﬁts is that people tend to respond to
attractive individuals with approaches and afﬁliative tenden-
cies [88]. Some researchers even argue that a reason physi-
cally attractive people live longer than less attractive people
is because of accrued beneﬁts over a lifetime [46].
Our ﬁnding that a reason people cited for their willingness
to help was when the initiator was attractive is consistent
with the body of research on the positive relationship between
physical attractiveness and receiving help [9]. Across many
situations, people are more willing to help people they per-
ceive as attractive. However, while physically attractive peo-
ple are more likely to receive help across the board, this aspect
of human bias should ideally not be ampliﬁed by technology.
We acknowledge that, without thoughtful consideration,
video-based social authentication, like all technology that
includes images of users, has the potential to extend or exacer-
bate existing biases against less attractive people. In this case,
it is possible that less attractive people may have a harder time
getting someone to help authenticate them than more attrac-
tive people. However, it is important to note that attractiveness
was not one of the top ﬁve reasons people gave for agreeing
to help someone with a video chat. The majority of reasons
people gave were knowing someone a long time, being able
to effectively recognize them, how responsive they are, and
the number of friends they have in common. So, while people
cannot change many aspects of their physical attractiveness,
they do have control of many other reasons people would
authenticate them. For example, users could choose authenti-
cators they’ve known for a long time and/or reciprocate when
they are asked for help.
Furthermore, this ﬁnding reinforces our perspective that
video-based social authentication may only be suitable as a
fallback authentication method and may not be appropriate
as the primary authentication method. It would seem to be
most appropriate for use within a small group of people who
know and trust each other well (e.g., family members and
close friends). Interaction Appearance Theory suggests that
perceptions of physical attractiveness can be altered by social
interaction [1]. Positive social interaction leads to higher per-
ceptions of physical attractiveness among people who interact
with each other regularly [1]. In a situation where people used
video-based social authentication over a long time period, it
is possible that users could even build such regular social in-
teractions that their mutual perceived physical attractiveness
could increase [1].
5.3.2 SMS usability and reliability
We chose to use SMS to deliver ESM questionnaires due to
its ubiquitous availability and universal support by mobile
devices and cellular providers, as our participants used differ-
ent devices and services. However, SMS may not always be
