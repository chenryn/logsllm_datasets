In the es6 spec, various DataView functions have an _optional_ littleEndian
argument: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-
dataview.prototype.getuint32, however the es6 typings included with typescript
have these arguments as mandatory:

This causes problems when trying to compile code where the littleEndian
argument is not specified.
