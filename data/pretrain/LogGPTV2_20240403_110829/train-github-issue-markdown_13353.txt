Hi,
I have been running into a recurring issue with the test code below (I am just
quoting the most minimal version but the issue manifests itself every time
pyplot is invoked). I have been running matplotlib 3.4.3 on Visual Studio Code
(which freezes and needs manual restart) and jupyter-lab ("The kernel appears
to have died. It will restart automatically").
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
plt.plot([1,2,3], [1,2,3])  
plt.show()
On jupyter-lab, the above code also generates a deluge of runtime warnings
(which I am happy to send them in a separate file).  
I have tried removing and reinstalling matplotlib (multiple times) but the
issue reproduces itself.  
I am really not sure how to approach this. The code was working fine until a
few weeks ago, at which point I am not sure what changed. I am running this on
a Windows machine (arm64 architecture).
Thanks for any help, advice, or insight!
