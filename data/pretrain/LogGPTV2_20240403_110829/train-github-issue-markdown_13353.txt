Subject: Recurring Issue with Matplotlib in Visual Studio Code and Jupyter-Lab

Hello,

I have encountered a recurring issue with the following test code, which is a minimal example. The problem consistently appears whenever `pyplot` is invoked. I am using Matplotlib version 3.4.3 on a Windows machine with an ARM64 architecture.

### Minimal Example
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
plt.show()
```

### Symptoms
- **Visual Studio Code**: The application freezes and requires a manual restart.
- **Jupyter-Lab**: The kernel dies and automatically restarts. Additionally, a large number of runtime warnings are generated (I can provide these in a separate file if needed).

### Troubleshooting Steps Taken
- Reinstalled Matplotlib multiple times.
- Verified that the issue persists across both environments.

### Additional Information
- The code was functioning correctly until a few weeks ago, and I am unsure what changes may have caused this issue.

Any help, advice, or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
