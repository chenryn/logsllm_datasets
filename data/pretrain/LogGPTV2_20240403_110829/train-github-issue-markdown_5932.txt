 **Describe the bug**  
SQLAlchemy (on the latest master version) does not place correct parenthesis
when using the `||` operator.
**Expected behavior**
    expr = type_coerce(Author.id + literal(1), types.String)
    f = (Author.first_name + expr).label('f')
    session.query(f).select_from(Author)
I expect the following query:
    SELECT author.first_name || (author.id + ?) AS f
    FROM author
Producing:
    Name1
    Name2
    ...
Instead SQLAlchemy generate the following query:
    SELECT author.first_name || author.id + ? AS f
    FROM author
Leading to incorrect results:
    1
    1
    ...
Unlike the SQL operator `+`, the operator `||` has the highest precedence.  
Therefore to interpret this query correctly parenthesis are needed.
