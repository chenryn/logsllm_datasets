## Solution:
In this Roulette game, we need to make more than `ONE_BILLION` dollars, winning at least `HOTSTREAK` times, in order to get the flag.
A typical game is similar to the following:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/roulette# ./roulette
Welcome to ONLINE ROULETTE!
Here, have $2436 to start on the house! You'll lose it all anyways >:)
How much will you wager?
Current Balance: $2436   Current Wins: 0
> 42
Choose a number (1-36)
> 24
Spinning the Roulette for a chance to win $84!
Roulette  :  9
Not this time..
It's over for you.
How much will you wager?
Current Balance: $2394   Current Wins: 0
>
```
We start with a random amount of cash. We place a bet on one of the number, and if we get it right we double our bet. Given the odds, though, most chances are that we'd lose. Unless we cheat, that is.
First, let's check what happens if we try to bet on more than we have:
```
How much will you wager?
Current Balance: $9      Current Wins: 0
> 10
You can't bet more than you have!
How much will you wager?
Current Balance: $9      Current Wins: 0
```
The program won't let us. This is enforced by the following logic:
```c
long get_long() {
    printf("> ");
    uint64_t l = 0;
    char c = 0;
    while(!is_digit(c))
      c = getchar();
    while(is_digit(c)) {
      if(l >= LONG_MAX) {
	l = LONG_MAX;
	break;
      }
      l *= 10;
      l += c - '0';
      c = getchar();
    }
    while(c != '\n')
      c = getchar();
    return l;
}
long get_bet() {
  while(1) {
    puts("How much will you wager?");
    printf("Current Balance: $%lu \t Current Wins: %lu\n", cash, wins); 
    long bet = get_long(); 
    if(bet = LONG_MAX) {
        l = LONG_MAX;
	      break;
      }
```
Which means that we aren't allowed to bet on LONG_MAX, but we are allowed to be on LONG_MAX + 1 (which will be interpreted as 0) or higher:
```
Current Balance: $9      Current Wins: 0
> 2147483647
You can't bet more than you have!
How much will you wager?
Current Balance: $9      Current Wins: 0
> 2147483648
Choose a number (1-36)
> 1
Spinning the Roulette for a chance to win $0!
```
What happens if we bet on LONG_MAX + 100000000?
```
Current Balance: $1245   Current Wins: 0
> 2247483647
Choose a number (1-36)
> 1

WRONG
Stop wasting your time.
*** Current Balance: $2047484894 ***
Wait a second... You're not even on a hotstreak! Get out of here cheater!
```
`get_bet` returns with 2247483647 interpreted as signed, which is -2047483649 as a signed long:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/roulette# python
Python 2.7.15 (default, May  1 2018, 05:55:50)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux2

2247483647
>>> numpy.int32(2247483647)
-2047483649
>>>
```
The bet is subtracted from the cash, but since the bet is negative, the cash grows:
```c
      bet = get_bet();
      cash -= bet; // => cash -= -2047483649 => cash += 2047483649 = 1245 + 2047483649 = 2047484894
```
As long as we don't guess right, we are richer. However, we have to be on a hotstreak to win, otherwise the program identifies us (correctly) as cheaters.
To correctly predict the upcoming number, we'll have to find another bug.
The chosen number is selected by calling `rand`:
```c
long spin = (rand() % ROULETTE_SIZE)+1;
```
However, `rand` is only pseudo-random. Given the same seed, it will produce the same outcome. The seed is selected by calling `/dev/urandom`:
```c
long get_rand() {
  long seed;
  FILE *f = fopen("/dev/urandom", "r");
  fread(&seed, sizeof(seed), 1, f);
  fclose(f);
  seed = seed % 5000;
  if (seed :)\n", cash);
```
So, given the amount of cash (a.k.a. random seed), we can predict all the upcoming random numbers, using the following C program:
```c
#include 
#include 
#define ROULETTE_SIZE (36)
#define NUM_RAND_NAMBERS (10)
int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
   int i;
   srand(atoi(argv[1]));
   for( i = 0 ; i  ")
    r.sendline(str(amount))
    r.recvuntil("> ")
    r.sendline(str(number))
    for i in range(7):
        line = r.recvline().strip()
        if line != "":
            print line
for i in range(3):
    number = random_arr.pop(0)
    random_arr.pop(0)
    make_bet(1, number)
make_bet(LONG_MAX + 100000000, 1)
print r.recvall()
```
The output:
