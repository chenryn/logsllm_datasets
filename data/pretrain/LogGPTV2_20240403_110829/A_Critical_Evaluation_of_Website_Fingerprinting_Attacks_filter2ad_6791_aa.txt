## Abstract
Recent studies on Website Fingerprinting (WF) claim to have found highly effective attacks on Tor. However, these studies often make assumptions about user settings, adversary capabilities, and the nature of the Web that may not hold in practical scenarios. This study critically evaluates these assumptions by conducting attacks under conditions where the assumptions do not hold. We show that variables such as users' browsing habits and differences in the location and version of the Tor Browser Bundle, which are typically omitted from current WF models, significantly impact the attack's efficacy. We also empirically demonstrate how prior work is susceptible to the base rate fallacy in open-world scenarios. To address this, we augment our classification method with a verification step, reducing false positives by over 63%. Despite this improvement, the problem remains an open issue for WF attacks.

## 1. Introduction
Anonymous communication systems, such as The Onion Router (Tor), are designed to protect users from malicious websites and network eavesdroppers by hiding the content and metadata of communications. Tor, with approximately three million daily users, is the most popular anonymous communication network, specifically designed for low-latency applications like web browsing. Tor routes connections through three-hop circuits and encrypts traffic using onion routing, ensuring that no single relay can know both the origin and destination of the communication simultaneously.

Although Tor hides routing information and communication content, analyzing network traffic can provide rich information to a capable attacker. By examining timing, frequency, and length of messages, an attacker can bypass robust security mechanisms and identify communicating parties. Website Fingerprinting (WF) allows an adversary to learn about a user's web browsing activity by recognizing patterns in their traffic. The adversary compares the network traces of Tor users to a set of pre-recorded webpage fingerprints to identify the accessed page.

Several previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of WF attacks on Tor, despite encryption, padding, and application-level defenses. However, these studies often make simplifying assumptions that give unrealistic advantages to the adversary. For example, many studies assume that the adversary and user use the same Tor Browser Bundle (TBB), visit the same localized version of a limited set of pages almost simultaneously, and use only one tab for browsing. Violating these assumptions can significantly reduce the attack's efficacy, making it less of a threat in real-world scenarios.

The goal of this study is to assess the practical feasibility of WF attacks proposed in prior work. Our contributions include:
- A critical evaluation of the assumptions made by prior WF studies.
- An analysis of the variables affecting the accuracy of WF attacks.
- An approach to reduce false positive rates.
- A model of the adversary's cost to maintain a successful WF system.

## 2. Website Fingerprinting
In a typical WF scenario, the adversary aims to identify which page a user is visiting, potentially for surveillance or intelligence purposes. The WF attack is treated as a classification problem, where the categories are webpages and the observations are traffic traces. The adversary collects traffic traces by visiting webpages and trains a supervised classifier using features such as packet length, direction, and inter-arrival times. When a user visits a webpage over Tor, the adversary records the network trace and runs the classifier to guess the visited site.

The first WF attacks were developed to identify pages within a single website over SSL connections. In 2002, Sun et al. tackled the more challenging problem of identifying individual pages within a set of websites, leading to Hintz’s attack on an anonymizing web proxy (SafeWeb). Many WF studies on one-hop proxy attacks followed. Herrmann et al. deployed the first WF attack on the Tor anonymity network with a 3% success rate for a world of 775 pages. Subsequent studies significantly improved the accuracy, with some reporting success rates over 90% for a world of 100 pages.

## 3. Model
We model the WF adversary as passive and local, able to eavesdrop on the user's traffic but unable to modify packets or decrypt their contents. Figure 1 depicts the basic WF scenario, where the attacker taps the network between the victim and the Tor entry guard, collecting traffic traces and comparing them against a database of webpage fingerprints.

### 3.1 Assumptions
We compiled the assumptions made in the literature on WF attacks on Tor, dividing them into three parts: (i) Client-side, (ii) Adversary, and (iii) Web.

**Client-setting:**
- **Closed-world:** The user can only visit k webpages, a strong assumption as k is small compared to the actual number of webpages.
- **Browsing behavior:** Users browse sequentially, one page at a time, with only a single tab open. Real-world studies suggest that users often have multiple tabs or windows open, especially on slower Tor connections.

**Web:**
- **Template websites:** All websites are built using templates, simplifying the model.
- **Localized versions:** Studies often use localized versions of webpages to avoid different language versions, which can significantly affect trace sizes. For example, the English version of ask.com has a much larger trace size than the German version.

**Adversary:**
- **Page load parsing:** The adversary can detect the beginning and end of different page loads in a traffic trace, a challenging task.
- **No background traffic:** The adversary can filter all background network traffic, which is nontrivial in real-world settings.
- **Replicability:** The adversary can train the classifier under the same conditions as the victim, a significant challenge in practice.

## 4. Variables Affecting WF Attack Accuracy
We identified several variables that affect the accuracy of WF attacks, which were omitted from previous models. These include:
- User's browsing habits
- Differences in the location and version of the Tor Browser Bundle
- Variations in webpage content and structure
- Background traffic and other network activities

We conducted comparative experiments to evaluate the effects of these variables on traffic traces and classifier accuracy. Our results show that the accuracy can drop by up to 70% when these variables are considered.

## 5. Reducing False Positive Rates
We addressed the issue of false positives in an open-world scenario of 35K webpages by using a Classify-Verify approach. This method reduces the number of false positives by over 63%, though it does not completely solve the problem.

## 6. Adversary's Cost Model
We modeled the cost that an adversary would incur to maintain a successful WF system. Maintaining a perfect WF system is costly, as the adversary needs to collect information about different localized versions of webpages, user's browsing settings, and update the system over time to recover from data staleness.

## Conclusion
Our study critically evaluates the assumptions made in prior WF research and demonstrates the significant impact of variables such as user's browsing habits and differences in the Tor Browser Bundle. While we have reduced false positives, the problem remains an open issue for WF attacks. Future work should focus on developing more realistic models and effective countermeasures.
