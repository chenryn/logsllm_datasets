User: Can python retrieve the name of the user that owns a windows service?
I've had a fiddle with win32serviceutil but to no avail, nor can I find much documentation on it beyond starting and stopping services.
Thanks!
Assistant: Sorted, I had the service run a python script with win32api.GetUserName() as it's output.
