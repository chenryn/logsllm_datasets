**ATT&CK ID:** M1022  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Restrict File and Directory Permissions

To enhance security, the `sudoers` file should be configured to enforce the following policies:
- Always require passwords for sudo commands.
- Prohibit users from executing potentially risky processes with elevated privileges.

This configuration helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and ensures that only necessary actions are performed with higher privileges.
