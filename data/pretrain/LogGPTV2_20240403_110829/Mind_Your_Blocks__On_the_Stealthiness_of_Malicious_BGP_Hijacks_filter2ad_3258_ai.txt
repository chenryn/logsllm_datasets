IV. RESULTS
We now turn to the description of our results, by detailing
step-by-step the outcome of every component of our experi-
mental environment in Figure 1. We ﬁnish with a thorough
investigation and validation of the candidate malicious BGP
hijacks we have identiﬁed.

SUMMARY OF THE BGP AND TRACEROUTE DATASET.
Fig. 3. BGP hijack identiﬁcation: scores between January 2013 and June
2014.
A. Data collection results
We consider a dataset of BGP and traceroute data collected
between January 2013 and June 2014 (1.5 years). A summary
of the dataset is provided in Table I.
During 18 months we monitored a total of 391,444 distinct
IP address blocks which sent spam to our spamtraps. These
networks were operated from 18,252 different ASes. Finally,
more than 5.5M data plane measurements and about 25.6M
BGP routes towards these networks were collected.
B. Multi-stage scoring and ﬁltering results
Figure 3 shows the distribution of scores for the monitored
spam networks. The ﬁrst part of the curve between the score
value 0 and approximately 0.25 corresponds to 31.29% of
spam networks exhibiting almost no variability in collected
BGP routes and traceroutes. These are very likely benign
cases. 68.60% of spam networks have a score between 0.25
and 0.75. Networks in that category usually exhibit a set of
various anomalies, which makes them hard to attribute to a
benign or malicious routing behavior. They may suffer from
limitations of the aggregation model or from inaccuracies in
the collected data [32], which, in the case of a benign routing
behavior, mistakenly increases the suspiciousness score and, in
the case of a malicious routing behavior, prevents it from being
correctly extracted by our scoring system. Finally, 0.11% of
monitored spam IP address blocks have a score higher than
0.75 and correspond to the most likely hijacked networks.
There are 437 different IP address blocks which exhibit a
score higher than 0.75. Each of them was monitored only once
during the 18 months of the experiment.
C. Validation of candidate hijack results
We leverage here the methodology presented in Sec-
tion III-C to (in)validate uncovered candidate hijacks. Due
6
to the large amount of time required to manually investi-
gate cases, we focused our analysis on the 437 spam IP
address blocks that scored above 0.75 in our multi-stage
scoring and ﬁltering system, i.e., the upper quartile in the
scoring distribution. Manual in-depth analysis of these 437
cases reveals that 373 of them are benign cases for one of
the following reasons. First, most benign cases correspond
to networks which disappear from the routing tables for a
few hours to several days while the network is monitored
and reappear after the network stopped being monitored thus
