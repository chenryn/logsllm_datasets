optimizations applied.
Reducing the Number of Consistency Checks in Corre-
lated OT: We further optimize the correlated OT protocol
by reducing the number of consistency checks. The protocol
of [41] performs one check between every pair of OT inputs,
for a total of k2 checks. We apply an optimization from [43]
(which [41] is based on, but does not use) which reduces
the number of checks to μ · k for a small constant μ. This
greatly reduces the computational costs of the protocol, for
a small sacriﬁce in security: based on the analysis in [43],
using μ = 3 should result in losing no more than 9 bits of
statistical security. In Fig. 17 we show a micro-benchmark of
the effect of using μ = 3 instead of μ = 10, which would
be the default without the optimization. The optimization
reduces the triple generation time by up to 40%.
XI. MEMORY USAGE
Supplementary to our peformance benchmarks for the
online and preprocessing phases, we also measured peak
memory usage.
For the online phase, none of our benchmarks exceeded 6
GB in memory usage; this is well below the available RAM
in our experimental setup (16 GB) and our max. heap size
JVM setting (15 GB). As such, memory does not present a
bottle-neck. Peak memory usage was consistently lower for
(cid:18)(cid:18)(cid:18)(cid:25)
SPDZ2k than SPDZ (up to a 1.4 factor improvement) across
all benchmarks.
For the ofﬂine phase, SPDZ2k and MASCOT memory
usage was below half a gigabyte. While Overdrive’s memory
usage was much higher (˜4GB for k = 64) it still fell well
below the available RAM (16GB) of our machines.
