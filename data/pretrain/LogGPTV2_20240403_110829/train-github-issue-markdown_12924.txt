As far I know, .once would fire only one time.  
However, .once would **fire multiple times** , when the DOM is " **not** " the
last binding DOM in template.
For example,
    btn#1 
    btn#2
while if I change the order of the two buttons, i.e.,
    btn#1 
    btn#2 
.once would has the expected behavior.
For the same issue, I can't assign multiple .once listeners for multiple DOMs.
    btn#1 
    btn#2 
    btn#3 
I was wondering this is a feature or bug.  
Thank you.

  1. btn#1 should fire only one time
  2. If hitting the buttons, fire alert only "once" for all of the three buttons!
### What is actually happening?
  1. btn#1 fire multiple time
  2. btn#1 and btn#2 fire multiple times.
