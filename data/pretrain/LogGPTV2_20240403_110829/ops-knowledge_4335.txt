User: Please sort out the CI/CD workflow and introduce some open source CI/CD tools.
Assistant: The CI/CD workflow usually includes the following steps: 1. Code management: Use Git and other version control tools for code management to ensure code version control and traceability. 2. Code construction: Use Maven, Gradle and other construction tools for automatic construction to generate executable applications or library files. 3. Code inspection: Use tools such as Lint and Checkstyle to conduct code inspection to ensure that the code complies with the norms and best practices. 4. Unit testing: Use JUnit, TestNG and other unit testing frameworks for automated unit testing to verify the correctness and robustness of the code. 5. Integration testing: Use Selenium, Cucumber and other integration testing frameworks to conduct automated integration testing to verify the correctness of collaboration between different modules and the soundness of system functions. 6. Deployment: Use Docker, Kubernetes and other containerized technologies for application deployment and management to ensure the stable operation of the application. 7. Monitoring and feedback: Use monitoring and feedback tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system performance and provide exception prompts, so as to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. The following are some open source CI/CD tools: 1. Jenkins: An open source automated build tool that supports various version control systems and build tools, and is easy to configure, use, and expand. 2. Travis CI: A cloud-based CI/CD tool that supports multiple programming languages and automates building and deploying applications. 3. CircleCI: A fully automated CI/CD platform that supports multiple programming languages and development tools, providing developers with flexible customization and integration methods. 4. GitLab CI/CD: A fully integrated CI/CD system that works seamlessly with the GitLab platform and can be used to automatically build, test, and deploy applications. 5. TeamCity: A professional CI/CD tool suitable for automated construction and integration of enterprise-level applications and complex software projects.
