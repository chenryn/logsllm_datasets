User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题eJabberd and GTalk no longer federating. Did Google drop support for server-to-server XMPP? Recently GTalk and my local eJabberd installation have stopped talking to each other.
The eJabberd log says the following:

I'm using eJabberd 2.1.11. Any suggestions? Or did Google finally kill XMPP federation for GTalk?

Assistant: If you enforce encryption (STARTTLS) on your s2s link, you're effectively blocking federation with GTalk. They don't support encrypted S2S.
