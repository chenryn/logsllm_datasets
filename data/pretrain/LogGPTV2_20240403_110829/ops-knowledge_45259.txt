User: How to build a high availability system? What is failover and load balancing?
Assistant: The following aspects need to be considered in building a high-availability system: 1. Multi-node deployment: Divide the functions of the system into multiple nodes, and realize system load balancing by allocating requests to different nodes, so as to avoid the failure of a single node from affecting the entire system. 2. Data backup and disaster recovery: back up data regularly to avoid data loss, and set up a disaster recovery mechanism for backup data to ensure that even if the system in a certain area is destroyed, it can be restored in time. 3. Using cloud services: Cloud services can be used to easily deploy multiple nodes and data backup, while also enabling automatic disaster recovery and maintenance. Failover refers to automatically transferring requests to other healthy nodes when a node fails to ensure the continuity and stability of the system. Failover can be implemented in software or in hardware, such as using a redundant array of hard disks (RAID). Load balancing is a technique that distributes requests from multiple clients to multiple servers to improve system performance and scalability. Load balancing can use a variety of algorithms, such as round robin, least connection, etc. Load balancing can be implemented by hardware and software. Common load balancing software includes Nginx, HAProxy, and Apache Tomcat.
