##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
ansible core (ssh login)
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.3.0.0
      config file = ... /ansible/etc/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
      python version = 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Aug 18 2016, 08:36:59) [GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-17)]
##### CONFIGURATION
new install from tar ball
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
##### SUMMARY
When a host file contains the same host under multiple groupings the final
ansible_user setting overrides and the ansible_user=xxx is ignored from the
actual host entry being used.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Create an inventory file
    [bobs-machines]
    machineA  ansible_user=bob
    machineB  ansible_user=bob
    [sallys-machines]
    machineA ansible_user=sally
    machineC ansible_user=sally
validate the user that ansible is using
ansible -vvv **bob** s-machine -m ping
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I would expect that both machineA and machineB are used with ssh user bob.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    ESTABLISH SSH CONNECTION FOR USER: sally
    ESTABLISH SSH CONNECTION FOR USER: bob
    SSH: EXEC ssh -C -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s -o KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no -o PreferredAuthentications=gssapi-with-mic,gssapi-keyex,hostbased,publickey -o PasswordAuthentication=no -o User=sally -o ConnectTimeout=10 ...

If the command was run with ALL to run against all hosts, I'm not sure what I
would expect the correct bahavior to be. There are two possbility of either
running against each host once using one or the other ansible_user settings or
treating differnt users as different hosts and running against each of them.
The current behavior is to run against each host exaclty 1 time regardelss of
ansbile_user settings and use the last ansbile_user specificed.
In this example since the example command above is not running agianst Sally's
host, the values for Sally's host should have no impact to Bob's hosts.
