User: I have a simple python script I can run through terminal. Is there a way to put a shortcut on my mac desktop to open terminal and run like "cd ~/Desktop/script.py"? I have tried automator but i couldn't get it to work
Assistant: you have to create a samplename.sh file and put the below line and run it ./samplename.sh
~/Desktop/script.py
create symbolic link to that .sh file and place it on desktop.
