answer , anyone can help me ?
The source is currently in transit and will move to the OmniSharp org. What
you need to do is this:
find the extension folder for ./script/code in your home dir, like ~/.code-
oss-build-dev/extension  
add a sym link that points to the omnisharp extension (for now from your
installation, soon from the github project)
