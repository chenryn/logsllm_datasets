## Abstract
After several years of theoretical research, the first implementations of distance bounding protocols have recently emerged. These protocols are typically analyzed for three types of attacks: Distance Fraud, Mafia Fraud, and Terrorist Fraud.

In this paper, we define and analyze a fourth main type of attack, called **Distance Hijacking**, which poses a serious threat in many practical scenarios. We show that many proposed distance bounding protocols are vulnerable to Distance Hijacking and propose solutions to make these protocols resilient to this type of attack.

We demonstrate that verifying distance bounding protocols using existing informal and formal frameworks does not guarantee the absence of Distance Hijacking attacks. We extend a formal framework for reasoning about distance bounding protocols to include overshadowing attacks. Using the resulting framework, we prove the absence of all identified attacks for protocols to which our countermeasures have been applied.

## 1. Introduction
Distance bounding protocols enable a device (the verifier) to securely obtain an upper bound on its distance to another device (the prover). Several distance bounding protocols have been proposed in recent years, differing in performance and security guarantees. Some protocols use digital processing and short symbols, while others rely on analog processing and signal streams similar to radar systems.

The security of distance-bounding protocols has primarily been evaluated by analyzing their resilience to three types of attacks: Distance Fraud, Mafia Fraud, and Terrorist Fraud. In Distance Fraud, a dishonest prover convinces the verifier of a false distance. In Mafia Fraud, an attacker interferes with the communication between an honest prover and the verifier. In Terrorist Fraud, a dishonest prover colludes with another attacker to deceive the verifier.

However, we show that many of these protocols, including the classical Brands and Chaum protocol and the recent CRCS protocol, are vulnerable to **Distance Hijacking** when used in environments with multiple provers. In Distance Hijacking, a dishonest prover exploits the presence of an honest prover to convince the verifier of a false distance. This type of attack can pose a serious threat in many practical scenarios.

Conceptually, Distance Hijacking lies between Distance Fraud and Terrorist Fraud. Unlike Terrorist Fraud, it involves a dishonest prover interacting with other honest provers. Unlike Distance Fraud, it involves additional honest provers. These differences have significant consequences, as existing countermeasures against Terrorist Fraud may not deter Distance Hijacking.

We provide an exhaustive classification of attacks on distance bounding protocols, including Distance Hijacking. Our classification leads to more descriptive and less generic names for previously known attack types. We perform a case study of existing protocols, showing that all protocols based on the Brands and Chaum structure are vulnerable to Distance Hijacking, while those based on the Hancke and Kuhn structure are less vulnerable. We propose two classes of effective and inexpensive countermeasures to secure these protocols against Distance Hijacking.

None of the existing frameworks for analyzing distance bounding protocols guarantees the absence of Distance Hijacking. We extend the formal framework of Basin et al. to capture all known types of Distance Hijacking and use it to formally prove the effectiveness of our countermeasures.

We also show that all distance bounding protocols, including those based on the Hancke and Kuhn protocol, may be vulnerable to Distance Hijacking in multi-protocol environments. Such attacks can be seen as a variant of the Chosen Protocol Attack but do not require shared cryptographic material. We discuss designs that enable such attacks and propose mitigating measures.

## 2. Background
A distance bounding protocol enables a verifier to establish an upper bound on its physical distance to a prover. As an example, we consider the basic Brands and Chaum protocol with signatures. The prover P generates a random bit string and sends a commit to the verifier V. The verifier then initiates a rapid bit exchange, where bits are sent one-by-one, and the prover must respond quickly with the exclusive-or (âŠ•) of the challenge bit string and his own bit string. The verifier derives an upper bound on the distance from the response times. After this phase, the prover sends the concatenation of the bits signed with his signature key. The verifier verifies the commit and the signature.

The goal of a distance bounding protocol is to provide a guarantee for the verifier V. Traditional analysis considers three types of attacks: Distance Fraud, Mafia Fraud, and Terrorist Fraud. All these attacks aim to make the verifier believe that the prover is closer than it really is. The main difference between these attacks is in the parties involved and their relationships.

## 3. Distance Hijacking
In this section, we define a fourth class of attacks, **Distance Hijacking**, which has been overlooked in the design of distance bounding protocols. We relate this class to the three classical attack types and propose an exhaustive classification of attacks on distance bounding protocols.

### 3.1 Definition of Distance Hijacking
A prover P is honest if and only if all of P's actions conform to the protocol specification.

**Definition 1.** A Distance Hijacking attack is an attack in which a dishonest prover P exploits one or more honest parties P1, ..., Pn to provide a verifier V with false information about the distance between P and V.

A protocol is vulnerable to Distance Hijacking if it allows P to perform a successful Distance Hijacking attack. These attacks do not exclude the involvement of other attackers or honest verifiers that might enable the execution of the attack.

In the context of distance bounding protocols, the information about the distance is the upper bound. Hence, attacks involve convincing V that P is closer than it actually is. In a typical Distance Hijacking attack, a dishonest prover P convinces a verifier V that P has executed a distance measurement phase, whereas this phase was actually executed by an honest prover P'.

### 3.2 Example of Distance Hijacking
**Example 1.** Figure 2 depicts a basic Distance Hijacking attack on the signature-based Brands and Chaum protocol from Figure 1.

In the attack, V thinks he is communicating with P, where P is dishonest. When an honest prover P' tries to prove his distance, P initially allows the protocol to proceed as normal between P' and V, waiting until the final signature is sent by P'. Before this point, V has no cryptographic evidence that the messages were sent by P'. When P' sends the signature, P jams the message, re-signs the content c with his own signature key, and sends the result to V. V will successfully verify the commit and the signature, falsely concluding that P has also sent the previous message. Thus, V assumes that P is within the claimed distance.

## 4. Countermeasures
We propose two classes of effective and generic countermeasures to secure distance bounding protocols against Distance Hijacking. These countermeasures are inexpensive and do not introduce additional messages or cryptographic operations.

### 4.1 Case Study
We perform a case study of existing protocols, showing that all protocols based on the Brands and Chaum structure are vulnerable to Distance Hijacking, while those based on the Hancke and Kuhn structure are less vulnerable. We apply our countermeasures to these protocols and use the extended formal framework to prove their effectiveness.

## 5. Formal Framework
None of the existing frameworks for analyzing distance bounding protocols guarantees the absence of Distance Hijacking. We extend the formal framework of Basin et al. to capture all known types of Distance Hijacking and use it to formally prove the absence of these attacks for protocols to which our countermeasures have been applied.

## 6. Multi-Protocol Environments
All distance bounding protocols, including those based on the Hancke and Kuhn protocol, may be vulnerable to Distance Hijacking in multi-protocol environments. Such attacks can be seen as a variant of the Chosen Protocol Attack but do not require shared cryptographic material. We discuss designs that enable such attacks and propose mitigating measures.

## 7. Location Hijacking
We generalize Distance Hijacking to **Location Hijacking**, showing that it is possible to hijack locations at which no other provers reside. This further highlights the need for robust security measures in distance bounding protocols.

## 8. Related Work
We review related work on distance bounding protocols and their security analysis, highlighting the gaps in existing frameworks and the importance of our contributions.

## 9. Conclusion
In conclusion, we identify Distance Hijacking as a significant threat to distance bounding protocols in multi-prover environments. We demonstrate the vulnerability of prominent protocols to this type of attack and propose effective countermeasures. We also extend a formal framework to model and prove the absence of Distance Hijacking and address the security of distance bounding protocols in multi-protocol environments. Finally, we generalize Distance Hijacking to Location Hijacking, emphasizing the need for comprehensive security measures in distance bounding protocols.
