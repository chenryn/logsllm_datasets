### Mail Service Provider Identification and Challenges

**Service Operation and Certificate Usage:**
The service at `provider.com` utilizes the ID from certificates. However, `myvps.com` operates its own mail server on a VPS hosted by `provider.com`. This scenario is particularly challenging to identify both automatically and accurately, especially when dealing with VPS servers hosted by web hosting companies. For instance, certain web hosting providers (e.g., GoDaddy with the domain `secureserver.net`) allow their VPS servers to create certificates under specific subdomains (e.g., `vps123.secureserver.net`). This can lead to misleading information, as third-party providers may present their customers' certificates. Without prior knowledge, automatic detection of such cases is difficult, necessitating manual identification.

**Banner/EHLO Messages and Misidentification:**
Another source of error arises from Banner/EHLO messages, which are unrestricted text. It is possible for a server to falsely claim to be `mx.google.com` in these messages. Since our approach prioritizes Banner/EHLO messages over MX records, this can result in mislabeling the server as `google.com`.

**Identifying Misidentifications:**
To efficiently find instances of misidentification, we observe that corner cases typically involve unpopular servers with few domains pointing to them. For example, IP addresses used by VPS servers (and their associated certificates) would appear only a few times in our dataset. In contrast, IP addresses and their associated certificates used by popular third-party mail providers would be more common, as these MX records are used by many domains. By examining the number of domains pointing to each IP address, we can quickly identify potentially misidentified MX records.

**Global Counters and Confidence Scores:**
We maintain two global counters: `numIP` (number of domains pointing to each IP address) and `numCert` (number of domains using each certificate). The confidence score for inferring the mail provider ID for an IP address is `max(numIP, numCert)`. If an IP address lacks certificate information, `numCert` is ignored. This score significantly reduces the number of cases requiring manual examination. However, it is impractical to manually check all providers in large datasets, so we focus on large providers.

**Manual Examination Heuristics:**
Once potential candidates are identified, we use various heuristics to simplify the manual review process. For example, a server claiming to be `google.com` but not residing in Google’s AS can be quickly dismissed. Additionally, GoDaddy uses specific hostnames for dedicated servers (e.g., `mailstore1.secureserver.net`) and different patterns for VPS servers (e.g., `s1-2-3.secureserver.net`), which aids in quick identification.

### Assigning Mail Provider IDs

**MX Record Assignment:**
Each MX record will be assigned a mail provider ID based on TLS certificate information, Banner/EHLO messages, or the MX record itself. If a domain has multiple primary MX records with different provider IDs, the domain is split across the multiple providers.

### Relative Accuracy of Approaches

**Approach Evaluation:**
We evaluate four approaches: (1) MX-only, (2) cert-based (combining TLS certificates and MX records), (3) banner-based (combining Banner/EHLO messages and MX records), and (4) priority-based (combining TLS certificates, Banner/EHLO messages, and MX records). We use 200 random domains sampled from three sets: all `.gov` domains, a stable set of Alexa domains, and a stable set of 1 million `.com` domains. Each set is sampled twice, once randomly and once with unique MX records, resulting in 1,200 domains.

**Ground Truth and Manual Labeling:**
Since there is no ground truth for mail providers, we manually label domains with SMTP servers by scanning relevant information. The labeled data is used to compare the results of the different methods.

**Results:**
The priority-based approach performs the best, with an accuracy of at least 97% for the two sets of domains. It missed 21 out of 1,200 domains and required manual examination of 20 domains. The MX-only approach, relying on a single data source, performs the worst, with an accuracy of only 40% for 200 random `.com` domains with unique MX records.

### Limitations

**Multi-Hop Delivery and MX Records:**
The priority-based approach has several limitations. First, email delivery often involves multiple hops, and we only observe the first step using DNS MX records. Second, MX records can point to any arbitrary server, and there is no guarantee that the server is responsible for handling the domain’s incoming mail. Additionally, our method is based on IPv4 addresses, and future work could extend it to handle IPv6 and corner cases more effectively.

### Large-Scale Identification of Mail Providers

**Target Domains:**
We apply the priority-based approach to three lists of target domains: Alexa Top 1M domains, stable random `.com` domains, and `.gov` domains. Data is collected over nine days (seven for `.gov` domains) between June 2017 and June 2021.

**External Data Sources:**
We use OpenINTEL for DNS measurement data and Censys for Internet-wide scans. OpenINTEL provides daily snapshots of DNS records, while Censys collects application-layer information from port 25 scans.

**Data Gathering:**
We extract DNS records and IP addresses from OpenINTEL and augment them with routing information. For each IP address, we query Censys for port 25 scanning data, including Banner/EHLO messages and certificates.
