I am encountering an issue with a potentially faulty Accelerate backend, and I'm unsure how to resolve it.

### Input:
```python
import numpy as np
# or
import pandas as pd
```

### Output:
```
init_dgelsd failed init
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
  File "/Applications/PyCharm.app/Contents/plugins/python/helpers/pydev/_pydev_bundle/pydev_import_hook.py", line 21, in do_import

    raise RuntimeError(msg)
RuntimeError: Polyfit sanity test emitted a warning, most likely due to using a buggy Accelerate backend. If you compiled NumPy yourself, please refer to the `site.cfg.example` file for configuration details. Otherwise, report this issue to the vendor that provided NumPy.
RankWarning: The polyfit function may be poorly conditioned.
```

### Issue Description:
The error message indicates that the `polyfit` function in NumPy is not functioning correctly, likely due to a problematic Accelerate backend. This results in a `RuntimeError` and a `RankWarning`, suggesting that the `polyfit` function may be poorly conditioned.

### Steps to Resolve:
1. **Check Installation Source**:
   - If you compiled NumPy yourself, review the `site.cfg.example` file for proper configuration.
   - If you installed NumPy via a package manager, report the issue to the provider of the NumPy package.

2. **Update or Reinstall**:
   - Ensure that you are using the latest version of NumPy and Pandas.
   - Consider reinstalling NumPy and Pandas in a clean virtual environment to rule out any potential conflicts.

3. **Alternative Backend**:
   - If the issue persists, you may need to switch to a different BLAS/LAPACK backend, such as OpenBLAS or MKL, by configuring the appropriate settings in your `site.cfg` file.

If you need further assistance, please provide additional details about your setup and the steps you have already taken.
