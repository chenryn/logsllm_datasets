         * BUILTIN\Administrators
         * Account Operators
         * Backup Operators
         * Print Operators
         * Server Operators
         * Domain Controllers
         * Read-Only Domain Controllers
         * Group Policy Creators Owners
         * Cryptographic Operators
      * Other Delegated Groups including any custom created groups with effective Tier 0 access.
#### Deploy your PAW(s)
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Ensure that the PAW is disconnected from the network during the operating system build process.
1. Install Windows 11 using the clean source installation media that you obtained earlier.
   > [!NOTE]
   > You might use Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) or another automated image deployment system to automate PAW deployment, but you must ensure the build process is as trustworthy as the PAW. Adversaries specifically seek out corporate images and deployment systems (including ISOs, deployment packages, etc.) as a persistence mechanism so preexisting deployment systems or images should not be used.
   >
   > If you automate deployment of the PAW, you must:
   >
   > * Build the system using validated and authentic installation media.
   > * Ensure that the automated deployment system is disconnected from the network during the operating system build process.
1. Set a unique complex password for the local Administrator account. Don't use a password that has been used for any other account in the environment.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Microsoft recommends using [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) to manage the local Administrator password for all workstations, including PAWs. If you use LAPS, ensure that you only grant the PAW Maintenance group the right to read LAPS-managed passwords for the PAWs.
1. Install Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 11 using the clean source installation media.
1. Configure Windows Defender Exploit Guard
1. Connect the PAW to the network. Ensure that the PAW can connect to at least one Domain Controller (DC).
1. Using an account that is a member of the PAW Maintenance group, run the following PowerShell command from the newly created PAW to join it to the domain in the appropriate OU:
   `Add-Computer -DomainName Fabrikam -OUPath "OU=Devices,OU=Tier 0,OU=Admin,DC=fabrikam,DC=com"`
   Replace the references to *Fabrikam* with your domain name, as appropriate. If your domain name extends to multiple levels (for example, child.fabrikam.com), add the other names with the "DC=" identifier in the order in which they appear in the domain's fully qualified domain name.
1. Apply all critical and important Windows Updates before installing any other software (including administrative tools, agents, etc.).
1. Force the Group Policy application.
   1. Open an elevated command prompt and enter the following command: `Gpupdate /force /sync`
   1. Restart the computer
1. (Optional) Install other required tools for Active Directory Admins. Install any other tools or scripts required to perform job duties. Ensure to evaluate the risk of credential exposure on the target computers with any tool before adding it to a PAW.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Using a jump server for a central location for these tools can reduce complexity, even if it doesn't serve as a security boundary.
1. (Optional) Download and install required remote access software. If administrators are using the PAW remotely for administration, install the remote access software using security guidance from your remote access solution vendor.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Carefully consider all the risks involved in allowing remote access via a PAW. While a mobile PAW enables many important scenarios, including work from home, remote access software can potentially be vulnerable to attack and used to compromise a PAW.
1. Validate the integrity of the PAW system by reviewing and confirming that all appropriate settings are in place using the following steps:
   1. Confirm that only the PAW-specific group policies are applied to the PAW
      1. Open an elevated command prompt and enter the following command: `Gpresult /scope computer /r`
      1. Review the resulting list and ensure that the only group policies that appear are the ones you created previously.
   1. Confirm that no other user accounts are members of privileged groups on the PAW using the following steps:
      1. Open **Edit Local Users and Groups** (lusrmgr.msc), select **Groups**, and confirm that the only members of the local Administrators group are the local Administrator account and the PAW Maintenance global security group.
         > [!IMPORTANT]
         > The PAW Users group should not be a member of the local Administrators group. The only members should be the local Administrator account and the PAW Maintenance global security group (and PAW Users should not be a member of that global group either).
      1. Also using **Edit Local Users and Groups**, ensure that the following groups have no members:
         * Backup Operators
         * Cryptographic Operators
         * Hyper-V Administrators
         * Network Configuration Operators
         * Power Users
         * Remote Desktop Users
         * Replicators
1. (Optional) If your organization uses a security information and event management (SIEM) solution, ensure that the PAW is [configured to forward events to the system using Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)](/archive/blogs/jepayne/monitoring-what-matters-windows-event-forwarding-for-everyone-even-if-you-already-have-a-siem) or is otherwise registered with the solution so that the SIEM is actively receiving events and information from the PAW. The details of this operation vary based on your SIEM solution.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If your SIEM requires an agent which runs as system or a local administrative account on the PAWs, ensure that the SIEMs are managed with the same level of trust as your domain controllers and identity systems.
1. (Optional) If you chose to deploy LAPS to manage the password for the local Administrator account on your PAW, verify that the password is registered successfully.
   * Using an account with permissions to read LAPS-managed passwords, open **Active Directory Users and Computers** (dsa.msc). Ensure that Advanced Features are enabled, and then right-click the appropriate computer object. Select the Attribute Editor tab and confirm that the value for msSVSadmPwd is populated with a valid password.
### Phase 2: Extend PAW to all administrators
Scope: All users with administrative rights over mission-critical applications and dependencies. This should include at least administrators of application servers, operational health and security monitoring solutions, virtualization solutions, storage systems, and network devices.
> [!NOTE]
> The instructions in this phase assume that Phase 1 has been completed in its entirety. Do not begin Phase 2 until you have completed all the steps in Phase 1.
Once you confirm that all steps were done, perform the following steps to complete Phase 2:
#### (Recommended) Enable **RestrictedAdmin** mode
Enable this feature on your existing servers and workstations, then enforce the use of this feature. This feature requires the target servers to be running Windows Server 2008 R2 or later and target workstations to be running Windows 7 or later.
1. Enable **RestrictedAdmin** mode on your servers and workstations by following the instructions available in this [page](https://aka.ms/rdpra).
   > [!NOTE]
   > Before enabling this feature for internet facing servers, you should consider the risk of adversaries being able to authenticate to these servers with a previously-stolen password hash.
1. Create "RestrictedAdmin Required - Computer" group policy object (GPO). This section creates a GPO that enforces the use of the /RestrictedAdmin switch for outgoing Remote Desktop connections, protecting accounts from credential theft on the target systems
   * Go to Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\System\Credentials Delegation\Restrict delegation of credentials to remote servers and set to **Enabled**.
1. Link the **RestrictedAdmin** Required - Computer to the appropriate Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 Devices by using the following policy options:
   * PAW Configuration - Computer
      * -> Link Location: Admin\Tier 0\Devices (Existing)
   * PAW Configuration - User
      * -> Link Location: Admin\Tier 0\Accounts
   * RestrictedAdmin Required - Computer
      * ->Admin\Tier1\Devices or -> Admin\Tier2\Devices (Both are optional)
   > [!NOTE]
   > This is not necessary for Tier 0 systems as these systems are already in full control of all assets in the environment.
#### Move Tier 1 Objects to the appropriate OUs
1. Move Tier 1 groups To the Admin\Tier 1\Groups OU. Locate all groups that grant the following administrative rights and move them to this OU.
   * Local administrator on more than one server
      * Administrative Access to cloud services
      * Administrative Access to enterprise applications
1. Move Tier 1 accounts to the Admin\Tier 1\Accounts OU. Move each account that is a member of those Tier 1 groups (including nested membership) to this OU.
1. Add the appropriate members to the relevant groups
   * **Tier 1 Admins** - This group contains the Tier 1 Admins that restricted from logging on to Tier 2 hosts. Add all your Tier 1 administrative groups that have administrative privileges over servers or internet services.
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > If administrative personnel have duties to manage assets at multiple tiers, you will need to create a separate admin account per tier.
1. Enable Credential Guard to reduce risk of credential theft and reuse. Credential Guard is a new feature of Windows 11 that restricts application access to credentials, preventing credential theft attacks (including Pass-the-Hash). Credential Guard is transparent to the end-user and requires minimal setup time and effort. For more information on Credential Guard, including deployment steps and hardware requirements, see the article, [Protect domain credentials with Credential Guard](/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard).
   > [!NOTE]
   > Device Guard must be enabled in order to configure and use Credential Guard. However, you are not required to configure any other Device Guard protections in order to use Credential Guard.
1. (Optional) Enable Connectivity to Cloud Services. This step allows management of cloud services like Azure and Microsoft 365 with appropriate security assurances. This step is also required for Microsoft Intune to manage the PAWs.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Skip this step if no cloud connectivity is required for administration of cloud services or management by Intune.
   * These steps restrict communication over the internet to only authorized cloud services (but not the open internet) and add protections to the browsers and other applications that process content from the internet. These PAWs for administration should never be used for standard user tasks like internet communications and productivity.
   * To enable connectivity to PAW services complete the following steps:
   1. Configure PAW to allow only authorized Internet destinations. As you extend your PAW deployment to enable cloud administration, you need to allow access to authorized services while filtering out access from the open internet where attacks can more easily be mounted against your admins.
      1. Create **Cloud Services Admins** group and add all the accounts to it that require access to cloud services on the internet.
      1. Download the PAW *proxy.pac* file from [TechNet Gallery](https://aka.ms/pawmedia) and publish it on an internal website.
         > [!NOTE]
         > You will need to update the *proxy.pac* file after downloading to ensure that it is up-to-date and complete.
         > Microsoft publishes all current Microsoft 365 and Azure URLs in the Office [Support Center](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). These instructions assume that you will be using Internet Explorer (or Microsoft Edge) for administration of Microsoft 365, Azure, and other cloud services. Microsoft recommends configuring similar restrictions for any 3rd party browsers that you require for administration. Web browsers on PAWs should only be used for administration of cloud services, and never for general web browsing.
         >
         > You might need to add other valid Internet destinations to add to this list for other IaaS provider, but do not add productivity, entertainment, news, or search sites to this list.
         >
         > You might also need to adjust the PAC file to accommodate a valid proxy address to use for these addresses.
         >
         > You can also restrict access from the PAW using a web proxy as well for defense in depth. We don't recommend using this by itself without the PAC file as it will only restrict access for PAWs while connected to the corporate network.
      1. Once you've configured the *proxy.pac* file, update the PAW Configuration - User GPO.
         1. Go to User Configuration\Preferences\Windows Settings\Registry. Right-click Registry, select **New** > **Registry Item** and configure the following settings:
            1. Action: Replace
            1. Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER
            1. Key Path: Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
            1. Value name: AutoConfigUrl
               > [!CAUTION]
               > Do not select the **Default** box to the left of Value name.
            1. Value type: REG_SZ
            1. Value data: enter the complete URL to the *proxy.pac* file, including http:// and the file name - for example `http://proxy.fabrikam.com/proxy.pac`. The URL can also be a single-label URL - for example, `http://proxy/proxy.pac`
               > [!NOTE]
               > The PAC file can also be hosted on a file share, with the syntax of `file://server.fabrikan.com/share/proxy.pac` but this requires allowing the file:// protocol. See the "NOTE: `File://` based Proxy Scripts Deprecated" section of this [Understanding Web Proxy Configuration](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2013/10/11/web-proxy-configuration-and-ie11-changes.aspx) blog for additional detail on configuring the required registry value.
