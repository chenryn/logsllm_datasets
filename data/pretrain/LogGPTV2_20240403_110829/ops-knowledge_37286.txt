I encountered a "segmentation fault error" with `yum`. Upon investigation, I discovered that the issue was related to `zlib`. However, in my attempt to fix it, I inadvertently made things worse. Now, I need to reinstall `zlib`, but since `yum` is no longer working, I need to do this using `rpm`, `wget`, or another method.

Could someone provide me with a step-by-step procedure for reinstalling `zlib`?

**Update:**

Initially, I expected more active responses from the community. However, I ended up contacting my server provider. They diagnosed the hard disk and found a physical fault. I backed up my data on another server, and they replaced the hard disks and installed a fresh operating system. Now everything is working fine.
