User: I would like to assign a global hotkey to my Python application, running in Gnome. How do I do that? All I can find are two year old posts saying, well, pretty much nothing :-)
Assistant: Check out the Deskbar source code - they do this; afaik, they call out a C library that interacts with X11 to do the job
