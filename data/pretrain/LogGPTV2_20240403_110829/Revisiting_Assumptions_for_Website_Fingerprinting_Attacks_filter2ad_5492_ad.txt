using sectioning by time duration. Figure 15 shows that the accuracy
decreases from 83.35% with 1 section to 75.70% with 5 sections with

5% overlap. However, as the % of overlap increases to over 10%,
the accuracy with 5 sections is higher than with 1 section. For
example, when the % of overlap is 20%, the accuracy for 1 section

Sectioning by number of packets means the number of packets
is the same for each section while sectioning by time duration
means the time interval is the same but number of packets could
be different for each section. The results show that sectioning by
time duration is better than sectioning by number of packets for
predicting both websites A and B (first and second websites).
4.5 Predicting Overlapping Point
Previous work [24] showed that the accuracy to find the split point
in overlapped trace is 32%. In Section 3, we showed that the split
point of two continuous traces can be accurately found. In this
section, we attempt to improve the prediction accuracy on the start
and end of where the two webpages overlap.
Our method works as follows. To determine if there is an overlap,
we hypothesize that the number of packets during an overlap will
be higher than when there is no overlap, since there will be the
network traffic from two webpages instead of one. We divided the
time into bins, so that we have discrete bins. For each bin, we then
counted the number of packets. If the number of packets in a bin
is higher than a threshold, we consider this as an overlap part. In
all our overlapped traces, we know the ground truth, so we can
calculate the accuracy of our prediction.
We vary the size of the bin from 1 millisecond to 10 seconds.
Figure 17 shows the prediction accuracy for the overlap and non-
overlap part when the bin size was 500 milliseconds. The accuracy
is around 60% when predicting either the overlap or no-overlap
part. Increasing the bin size shifts the graph to the right. We also
considered the size of all the packets in each bin as a predictor and
we obtained a similar result.
4.6 Summary
We proposed a “sectioning” algorithm that can achieve better accu-
racy (around 70% when predicting either the first or second website)
than previous methods (57% when predicting first website and 26%
when predicting second website) when there is some overlap of two
websites. We also showed that the exact point where the overlap
starts and stops can be reasonably predicted. The overlap part can

number of sections and overlap %, using b) sectioning by
time duration.
decreases to 57.67%, and the accuracy for 10 sections is 71.44%. This
shows that unlike sectioning by number of packets, the sectioning
algorithm improves the accuracy when predicting website A. From
Figure 16, it can be seen that with 5% overlapping packets, the
prediction accuracy with 1 section is 26.09%. When the number
of sections increases to 4, the accuracy also increases to 68.25%.
This indicates that sectioning helps in mitigating the impact of
the overlap. Increasing the number of sections further from 4 to
10 slightly increases the prediction accuracy and peaks at 70.11%
with 10 sections. As the % of overlap increases from 5% to 20%, the
accuracy decreases as expected. When there are 20% overlapping
packets, the accuracy for 1 section decreases further to 17.47%. As
the number of sections is increased to 4, the accuracy is 48.58%.
With 10 sections, the accuracy is 62.59%. This result shows that
sectioning by time duration is slightly better than sectioning by
number of packets, but the shape of the graphs is similar.

thus be effectively ignored and an effective website fingerprinting
attack performed.
5 ANALYSIS OF PARTIAL TRACES
5.1 Motivation
This section shows the impact of the possibility of partial traces
(only part of the website traffic have been captured) on website
fingerprinting attacks. This could happen when a victim visits one
website and close the browser before the download is complete or
the adversary was only able to record part of the trace (either the
beginning or the end).
We assume there is only one website in the traffic trace. However,
the adversary is only able to record a fraction n of the traffic trace.
When n = 100%, then this is the assumption taken from previous
work that an attacker is able to capture entire traces for all websites.
We vary n from 80% to 100% of the traffic trace from either the
beginning or the end. The adversary can observe the first n% of a
website’s traffic trace before some interference occurs, or the last
n% of a website’s traffic trace. Figure 18 shows the result of our
experiments. When the whole trace is recorded, the accuracy is
at 89.9%. When 10% of the packets are missed at the end of the
trace, then the accuracy goes down to 64.1%. However, when 10%
of the packets are missed at the beginning of the trace, then the
accuracy goes down to 15.05%. It can be seen that capturing the
first n% of a website’s trace is more important than the last n%. This
could be due to more outgoing requests from the client to the server
which makes fingerprinting easier and more identifiable. This result
confirms that of [9]. The figure also shows that as the percentage of
the trace available decreases, the accuracy decreases significantly.
Figure 18: Accuracy of website fingerprinting when observ-
ing different percentages of network traffic traces.
5.2 Sectioning Algorithm on Partial Traces
Since we have shown that our sectioning algorithm can still provide
a high prediction accuracy for overlapped traces, we now apply
the same algorithm to partial traces. The hypothesis is the same:
some sections will be missing, but this should not affect the other
sections. We used the sectioning algorithm by time duration as this
has been shown to provide a better prediction accuracy. We also
Figure 19: Prediction accuracy when varying the number of
sections and the % of missing packets from the beginning.
used the same dataset as before. The training datasets consist of the
whole network traces. The testing datasets consist of the remaining
instances with missing packets either at the beginning or at the
end. For each testing dataset, we remove the first n% of packets
either from the beginning or from the end.
5.3 Results
Figure 19 and Figure 20 show the accuracy in correctly predicting
websites based on partial traces, when varying the % of missing
packets and the number of sections. The base case is with 1 section,
which means no sectioning algorithm applied. From Figure 19, it
can be seen that with 5% missing packets from the beginning of a
trace, the prediction accuracy with 1 section is 20.76%. When the
number of sections increases to 4, the accuracy increases to 57.34%.
This indicates that sectioning helps in mitigating the impact of the
missing packets. Increasing the number of sections further from 4
to 10 slightly increases the prediction accuracy and peaks at 62.66%
with 8 sections. As the % of missing packets increases from 5%
to 20%, the accuracy decreases. This is expected since with more
missing packets, it affects more sections, which makes prediction
of the whole website harder. By using our sectioning algorithm, the
accuracy improves significantly from the base case.
Figure 20 shows the accuracy of correctly predicting websites
based on partial traces with packets missing from the end. When
missing 5% and 10% packets from the end of a trace, the prediction
accuracy with 1 section is 79.02% and 58.80% respectively. With 10
section, the accuracy is 64.78% and 53.92% respectively. It is slightly
lower than the base case. However, when the % of missing increases
to 15% and 20%, the accuracy with 10 sections is 42.35% and 30.61%
compared to the base case 35.92% and 19.49%.
5.4 Summary
We show that our “sectioning” algorithm can also be used for partial
traces. It has a better accuracy (62.66%) comparing to previous meth-
ods (20.76%) on predicting websites with missing packets at the
beginning. Our algorithm achieves similar accuracy with packets

6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, our goal is to address the impracticalities of website
fingerprinting attacks and propose solutions to several limitations:
(1) We propose a “splitting” algorithm to identify two continu-
ous network traces with an accuracy of 80% in finding the
split point of the two traces.
(2) We propose a “sectioning” algorithm to improve the accuracy
in website prediction of two overlapping traces from 22.80%
to 67.9% and partial traces from 20.76% to 62.66%.
For the future work, we will test our algorithm in the open world
setting and will consider the scenario when more than two pages are
continuous or overlap. Moreover, we have shown some promising
results in predicting exactly where two webpages overlap; we plan
to investigate this further. We will also run more experiments with
a more diverse dataset.
