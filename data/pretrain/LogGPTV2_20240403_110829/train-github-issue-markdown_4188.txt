**EDIT:** For the impatient ones, Skip down to my comment below with
directions on how to install all dependencies for Julia on Ubuntu 12.04.
It'd be great to have an Ubuntu PPA that collects all the software that Julia
needs to compile. This could significantly cut down on compile times, and
would be a nice first step toward having actual binary packages of Julia for
debian.
From my tests, the following packages work with/are necessary to build Julia:
    gfortran
    llvm-3.1-dev (ppa:dr-graef/llvm-3.1.precise)
    libblas-dev
    liblapack-dev
    libarpack2
    libpcre3-dev
    libglpk-dev
    lighttpd
    libgmp-dev
    libunwind7-dev
    libreadline-dev
This leaves SuiteSparse (Only 3.4.0 is available, no 4.0.2, as far as I can
see), FFTW (Installing `libfftw3-dev` didn't work for me; I got the dreaded
LoadError, so I figured I'd just let Julia compile her own which works), zlib
(It doesn't come with large file support by default), and whatever else I'm
missing.
