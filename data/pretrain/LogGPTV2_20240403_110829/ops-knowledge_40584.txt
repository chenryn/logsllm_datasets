User: Please explain how to ensure the stability of a web application under high load conditions, and what specific measures include?
Assistant: 1. Horizontally expand system resources: increase hardware resources such as servers, load balancers, and distributed caches to support higher concurrency and processing capabilities. 2. Vertical expansion of system resources: enhance the processing capacity of the server to support higher performance. 3. Database optimization: For high-load web applications, the database is usually the bottleneck. Therefore, database optimization is required, such as adding indexes, compressing tables, and partitioning. 4. Caching technology: Use caching technology to reduce the pressure of database access, such as using caching technology for page caching, query caching, object caching, etc. 5. Distributed deployment: Divide the application program into multiple parts and distribute them on different servers to realize distributed computing and load balancing, and improve the reliability and performance of the entire system. 6. Code optimization: If the system still has problems under high load, you can consider optimizing the code, such as shortening code execution time and reducing memory usage. 7. Monitoring and alarm system: establish a system monitoring and alarm system, detect system failures and alarms in time, and take corresponding measures to solve problems. 8. Automated testing: While the application is being developed, automated testing can be established to ensure the stability of the application under high load conditions.
