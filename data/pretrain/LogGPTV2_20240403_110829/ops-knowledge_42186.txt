Certainly! Here is the log converted into a more structured and clear format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "Sun Dec 04 05:15:09 2005",
  "epoch_timestamp": 1133644509,
  "severity": "error",
  "client_ip": "222.166.160.184",
  "message": "Directory index forbidden by rule: /var/www/html/"
}
```

This structure organizes the information in a JSON format, which is both human-readable and easy to parse programmatically.
