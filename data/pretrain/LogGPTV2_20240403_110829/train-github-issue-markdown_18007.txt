##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
eos_config
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.3.0
      config file = /home/vagrant/iostest/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
Using default config
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Ubuntu managing Arista
##### SUMMARY
In this special case when multiple VLANS are created without a name (or the
same name) associated to them, the "show run" of an Arista config puts them in
one line such as "vlan 10-11". This breaks the idempotency since it will
attempt to add the VLAN again. It will attempt to add VLAN 10 or 11 again, for
example. It appears as though during the running config check, the module is
parsing for an individual VLAN line with that particualr VLAN.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  1. Create a task that adds a NEW vlan to an arista switch. Do not add a name to this vlan at this time.
  2. Run the task again but change make vlan 11 instead of vlan 10
  3. Run the exact task in step 1...adding vlan 10 to the switch again
    #eos.yaml
    - name: role add vlan using eos_config module
      connection: local
      eos_config:
        lines:
         - vlan 10
        provider: "{{ cli }}"
      register: vlan_created_out
    #arista-vlan.yaml
    ---
    - name: playbook - vlan add using eos_config
      hosts: eos
      gather_facts: no
      connection: local
      vars_files:
        - creds.yaml
      roles:
        - { role: vlan_add }
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Step 1) Expected output, changed=1 and new vlan 10 created  
Step 2) Expected output, changed=1 and new vlan 11 created  
Step 3) Expected output, changed=0 and vlan 10 not attempted to be created
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Step 1) Expected output, changed=1 and new vlan 10 created  
Step 2) Expected output, changed=1 and new vlan 11 created  
Step 3) Expected output, changed=1 and vlan 10 attempted to be created
again...you can see when logging AAA commands that the vlan is attempting to
be created every time.
