It is very common use case when user wants to add reference of module file
(external file) by dragging and dropping it to editor. But right now VScode is
not supporting this feature. When user try to drag a file from the explorer
window it is opening that file in the editor.
In the below screen shout you can compare Visual studio and VS code action for
drag and drop.
