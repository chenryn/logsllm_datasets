It is a common use case for users to add a reference to an external module file by dragging and dropping it into the editor. However, this feature is currently not supported in VSCode. When a user attempts to drag a file from the explorer window, VSCode simply opens the file in the editor instead of adding a reference.

For comparison, please refer to the following screenshot, which illustrates the difference in behavior between Visual Studio and VSCode when performing a drag-and-drop action:

In the GIF, you can see that Visual Studio adds a reference to the file, whereas VSCode opens the file directly.
