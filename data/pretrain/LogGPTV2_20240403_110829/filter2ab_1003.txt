**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Cobalt Strike

Cobalt Strike is a sophisticated penetration testing tool that can execute payloads on remote hosts using PowerShell. This technique does not write any data to disk, making it difficult to detect.[56][57] Additionally, Cobalt Strike can leverage PowerSploit and other scripting frameworks to perform execution, further enhancing its capabilities for post-exploitation activities.[58][59][60][61]
