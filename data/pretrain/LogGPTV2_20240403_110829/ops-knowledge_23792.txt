I'm currently developing Python regression tests using Jenkins. For some reason, each individual test in the test suite is taking approximately 15 minutes to run (with a total of around 70-80 tests) when executed in Jenkins. However, when I run the same tests from the command line on the same Windows machine, each test takes only about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Additionally, I have added print statements in some of the files, but none of them appear in the Jenkins command-line output.

Has anyone else encountered this issue or have any suggestions?

Also, I am not performing a sync every time I build; I only sync once.

**Response:**

Thank you for providing these details. Here are a few steps and considerations that might help diagnose and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Machine Load:**
   - Ensure that the machine running the Jenkins job is not under heavy load. High CPU or memory usage can significantly slow down test execution.
   
2. **Jenkins Memory Allocation:**
   - Verify that Jenkins has been allocated sufficient memory to run the tests. You can adjust the JVM heap size in the Jenkins configuration file (`jenkins.xml` or `java.args` in `jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration`) to ensure it has enough resources.
   
3. **Jenkins Master vs. Slave:**
   - Clarify whether you are running the tests directly on the Jenkins master or on a Jenkins slave/agent. Running tests on a slave can sometimes affect performance due to network latency or resource constraints on the slave.
   
4. **Output and Logging:**
   - The absence of print statements in the Jenkins console output suggests that the test environment or logging configuration might be different. Ensure that the logging level and output settings in Jenkins are configured to capture the print statements. You can also try using a more robust logging library like `logging` in Python to see if the messages are being captured.

5. **Test Environment Differences:**
   - Compare the environment variables, dependencies, and configurations between the Jenkins environment and your local environment. Any discrepancies could be causing the performance difference.

6. **Network and Resource Access:**
   - If your tests involve network calls or access to external resources, ensure that the Jenkins environment has the same access and that there are no network delays or restrictions.

By systematically checking these areas, you should be able to identify and address the root cause of the performance discrepancy. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the Jenkins community or support for further assistance.

Thank you!
