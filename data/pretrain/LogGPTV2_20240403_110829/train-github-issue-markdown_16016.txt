### System Information

- **Operating System:** Windows container on GitLab

- **Other Information:**

After upgrading to Playwright v1.36.1, I encountered errors when running the Playwright job in GitLab, and the tests failed to execute. The errors occurred after running the following commands:

1. `npx playwright install --with-deps`
2. `npx playwright install chrome`

#### Error Messages

I also attempted to install FFMPEG separately using `npx playwright install ffmpeg`, but encountered the same error.

#### Additional Context
- We are currently using Playwright v1.34.3.
- The previous version (v1.35) also worked without issues when I last upgraded.

Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any additional steps I should take to resolve this issue.
