After upgrading to v1.36.1 I ran the Playwright job in GitLab and I got some
error messages and Playwright tests don't run .The errors displayed after
running `npx playwright install --with-deps` and `npx playwright install
chrome`
_Failed to install browsers  
Error: Failed to download Chromium 115.0.5790.75 (playwright build v1071),
caused by

and

Currently we are using 1.34.3 and I think it also worked on 1.35 when I tried
to upgrade after the last version was out
I noticed that there is a FFMPEG message so I also tried `npx playwright
install ffmpeg` but got the same error
