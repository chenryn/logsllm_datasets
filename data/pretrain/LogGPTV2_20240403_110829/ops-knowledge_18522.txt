User: Write a program in Python that can connect to a remote server via SSH and execute commands.
Assistant: The following is the Python code implementation: ```python import paramiko # Log in to the remote server ssh = paramiko.SSHClient() ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) ssh.connect('remote_hostname', username='username', password=' password') # Execute command stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('ls -l') # Output command result print(stdout.read().decode()) # Close SSH connection ssh.close() ``` The paramiko library needs to be installed: `pip install paramiko`. Code analysis: 1. `paramiko.SSHClient()` creates an SSHClient object. 2. `set_missing_host_key_policy()` sets the host key policy, which means that if there is no key of the remote server locally, it will be added automatically. 3. `ssh.connect()` logs in to the remote server. 4. `ssh.exec_command()` executes the command and returns 3 file objects, representing the standard input, standard output and standard error output respectively. 5. `stdout.read().decode()` reads standard output and decodes it as a string. 6. `ssh.close()` closes the SSH connection.
