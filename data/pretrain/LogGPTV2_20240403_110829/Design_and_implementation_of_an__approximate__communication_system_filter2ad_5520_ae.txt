### Comparison of Apex with Re-transmission Strategies

As the channel condition deteriorated, the performance gains of Apex became even more pronounced. This observation led us to further investigate how Apex compares to various re-transmission strategies.

#### Apex vs. Re-transmission Strategies

Another method to evaluate the benefits of Apex is to measure the reduction in re-transmission traffic it can achieve. To do this, we configured a traditional system to re-transmit each lost symbol multiple times, with a re-transmission limit of up to 7 attempts (a common practice in 802.11 systems). Figure 16 illustrates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for both Apex (with no re-transmissions) and the traditional system (with 1, 2, or 3 re-transmissions). At the limit of 3 re-transmissions, the traditional system achieved the same PSNR as Apex. 

To better understand the bandwidth savings, we compared the relative bandwidth consumed by Apex (with no re-transmissions) to the traditional system (with a 3-retransmission limit) in a wireless scenario. Figure 17 shows the increased volume of traffic (including re-transmissions) for the traditional system compared to the number of transmissions in Apex. Both schemes achieve the same PSNR for the video, but as the channel quality degrades, the bandwidth requirements for the traditional system increase significantly.

### Performance of Apex on Audio

We also evaluated the performance improvements offered by Apex for audio. For this, we used WavPack [5] to generate a compressed encoding of an audio clip. WavPack produces two output files: one containing frequencies important for human perception (middle of the auditory range) and another with less perceptible frequencies (at the fringes of the auditory range). We mapped the bits corresponding to the first set to more error-resilient bit positions and the bits corresponding to the second set to more error-prone bit positions. Our results show that Apex can improve the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) calculated using Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) by about 1 (on a scale of 0-5) under certain conditions. Research has shown that a MOS reduction of only 0.1 is noticeable to the human ear [26]. Further experimental details are omitted for brevity.

### Parameter Selection: Number of Pilot Symbols

One key parameter in the Apex system is the number of pilot symbols used per frame (1 in 100). We determined this value through a series of experiments where we varied the number of pilot symbols in 1500-byte packets and observed the accuracy of predicting Bit Error Rates (BERs) in different bit positions. The more pilot symbols used, the higher the overhead, but the more accurate the estimation. Table 5 shows this variation, where the error is defined as (Actual BER - Estimated BER) / Actual BER. To balance the trade-off between overhead and accuracy, we decided to use 1 pilot symbol for every 100 symbols of data, resulting in an overhead of 1% due to the Apex BER estimation process.

### Related Work

We categorize prior related efforts into the following areas:

#### PHY-MAC Approaches

Recent research has explored wireless communication techniques that leverage mechanisms at the Physical (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) layers to recover more bits from erroneous packets, such as PPR [18], ZipTx [21], SOFT [36], and Maranello [13]. While these schemes apply generally to all data, they do not exploit the unique approximation properties of wireless errors. In contrast, Apex learns and utilizes the structure of wireless symbol errors to enhance the performance of media delivery applications.

SoftCast [17] is a related scheme that improves wireless media delivery performance in multicast settings by using properties of wireless errors similar to Apex. However, there are three main differences:
1. **Media Representation**: SoftCast requires media content to be represented and transmitted in a raw numerical format, which is different from popular standards like H.246. Media in these formats must be converted to the SoftCast format, a computationally intensive process. Apex, on the other hand, does not define a new media representation format and can use any existing format.
2. **Channel Adaptation**: SoftCast uses a static data representation format that is agnostic of wireless channel conditions. Apex dynamically adjusts mappings between bit sequences and symbols, and between data bits and bit positions based on channel conditions.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: SoftCast is designed for multicast traffic without receiver feedback. Apex focuses on unicast traffic, using immediate MAC layer acknowledgments to fine-tune the mappings for improved performance.

#### Network-Layer Approaches

Some recent research, such as MIXIT, has shown that knowledge of correct or incorrect symbol decoding from the PHY layer can be leveraged in multi-hop wireless settings to better recover data on opportunistic end-to-end paths [19]. These approaches operate on a network-wide scale by leveraging diversity across multiple nodes but discard symbols received in error, unlike Apex, which is designed for a single wireless hop.

#### Transport-Layer Approaches

Transport layer protocols like UDPlite [20] have been designed to allow applications to accept corrupted data values to recover some content. Several studies [31] have shown that under certain network conditions (e.g., high latency), this leads to better media streaming performance. These schemes complement our approach.

#### Application-Layer Approaches

Several research efforts aim to improve the quality of streaming content at the application layer through effective data prioritization. The primary technique is the addition of Forward Error Correction (FEC) to different data components to make them more resilient. A good survey of such schemes is provided in [35]. Other researchers have studied hybrid ARQ-based and FEC-based mechanisms for loss recovery [11, 28]. These techniques do not take advantage of the natural properties of the wireless channel, which Apex effectively exploits.

Prior theoretical studies [23, 16, 10, 33, 2, 27] have explored the existence of differential error properties at bit positions for individual constellation maps. Our work builds on these findings by designing constellation map switching, data bit placement strategies, and radio RF pipeline modifications, and evaluates these through practical implementation on real wireless hardware and experimentation for real media applications.

Finally, recent work [8, 38] highlights the benefits of exploiting differential error resilience for video delivery in unicast and broadcast settings based on numerical simulations. Specifically, [38] proposes modifications to the DVB-H [1] standard to leverage differential error resilience for terrestrial broadcast of video. In contrast, Apex explores the concept of approximate communication through a full system implementation and extensive experimentation.

### Conclusions and Future Work

This paper demonstrates that approximate communication is a promising idea. Our results on the WARP SDR platform show that our approximate communication system provides significant improvements in video quality, ranging from 5 dB to 20 dB in different scenarios. However, this is just the beginning, and several optimization problems remain open.

For example, a joint construction of data modulation schemes and constellation map selection might lead to further performance gains. Modulation schemes with unequally spaced constellation points could be particularly useful for unequal protection of bit positions. Additionally, the impact of buffering induced by Apex on performance needs to be better understood.

A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based implementation of Apex would be necessary to address these issues. We are currently building such a system and will explore these and other issues in future work.
