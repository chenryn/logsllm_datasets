−3). As the channel
condition became more error-prone, the gains of Apex increased
even further. This result prompted us to study how Apex compares
to various re-transmission strategies next.
Apex vs re-transmission strategies: One other way to com-
pute the gains of Apex is to compute how much re-transmission
trafﬁc it can save. To characterize this, we let the traditional sys-
tem to re-transmit each lost symbol multiple times. We bound
the re-transmission limit of the traditional system to upto 7 re-
transmission attempts (as is common in 802.11 system). In Fig-
ure 16, we show the PSNR of the two schemes (Apex with no re-
transmissions, and traditional with 1, 2, or 3 re-transmissions). At
the limit of 3 re-transmissions, the traditional scheme achieved the
same PSNR as Apex. It is more instructive to see the relative band-
width consumed by Apex with no re-transmissions, when com-
pared to traditional with 3 re-transmission limit for this wireless
scenario. Figure 17 shows the increased volume of trafﬁc (includ-
ing re-transmissions) for traditional communication, compared to
the number of transmissions in Apex. Note that both schemes now
achieve the same PSNR for the video, but as the channel deterio-
rates from time to time, the bandwidth requirements of traditional
communication sharply increases.
Audio on Apex: We have characterized the performance im-
provements offered by Apex for audio as well. For this we gener-
ated a compressed encoding of an audio clip using WavPack [5].
The WavPack tool generates two output ﬁles, one corresponding
to the audio frequencies which are important for human percep-
tion(the frequencies in the middle of the auditory range) and an-
other with information about frequencies not perceived properly
(frequencies at the fringe of auditory range) by human ears. We
map the bits corresponding to the ﬁrst set on more error resilient
bit positions while, the bits corresponding to the second set to more
error prone bit positions. We ﬁnd that Apex can improve the Mean
Opinion score calculated using Perceptual Evaluation of Speech
Quality(PESQ) of the audio received audio by about 1 (on a scale
of 0-5) in certain conditions. Research has shown that a MOS re-
duction of only 0.1 is noticeable by the human ear [26]. We omit
details pertaining to rest of the experiments for the sake of brevity.
Parameter selection — number of pilot symbols needed: One
of the parameters for the Apex system is the number of pilot sym-
bols used per frame (1 in 100). We made this choice through a
sequence of experiments, where we varied the number of pilot sym-
bols in a 1500 byte packets and observed the accuracy of predict-
ing the BERs in different bit positions. Greater the number of pilot
symbols, greater is the overhead of the scheme, but higher is the
likelihood of accurate estimation. Table 5 shows this variation,
where error is deﬁned as (Actual BER - Estimated BER)/Actual

decided to use 1 pilot symbol for every 100 symbols of data, i.e.,
an overhead of 1% due to Apex BER estimation process.
5. RELATED WORK
We partition prior related efforts into the following categories.
PHY-MAC approaches: In recent years, a growing number of
efforts have designed and studied wireless communication tech-
niques that utilize mechanisms at the PHY and MAC layers to re-
cover more bits out of erroneous packets, e.g., PPR [18], ZipTx [21],
SOFT [36], and Maranello [13]. While these schemes apply gen-
erally to all data, the transmitters in such schemes do not exploit
the unique approximation properties of wireless errors. In contrast,
transmitters in Apex learn about and utilize the structure in wire-
less symbol errors to improve the performance of media delivery
applications.
SoftCast [17] is a recently proposed, related scheme that im-
proves wireless media delivery performance in multicast settings
by using properties of wireless errors in a manner similar to Apex.
SoftCast represents data values in a “raw” numerical (analog) for-
mat and maps them directly to wireless symbols with speciﬁc trans-
mit power levels. However, there are three main differences be-
tween the two schemes: (i) SoftCast requires that media content
be represented and transmitted in the raw numerical format, dif-
ferent from what is used in popular standards, e.g., H.264. Me-
dia represented in these popular formats have to be converted into
the SoftCast format (through a computationally-intensive process)
to achieve its performance gains. In contrast, Apex does not at-
tempt to deﬁne any new media representation format and can uti-
lize any media format, including the one suggested by SoftCast.
(ii) SoftCast uses a static data representation format that is agnos-
tic of wireless channel conditions. In Apex, our mappings between
bit sequences to symbols, and between data bits to bit positions are
dynamically altered based on channel conditions. (iii) SoftCast is
designed speciﬁcally for multicast trafﬁc in which no receiver feed-
back is assumed. In contrast, Apex focuses on unicast trafﬁc, where
immediate MAC layer acknowledgments are used to dynamically
ﬁne-tune the mappings of bit-sequences to symbols, and data bits
to bit positions for improved performance. Such dynamic adjust-
ments are precluded in SoftCast. Hence, SoftCast and Apex are
applicable to video delivery in vastly different scenarios.
Network-layer approaches: Some recent research efforts, e.g.,
MIXIT, have shown knowledge of correct or incorrect symbol de-
coding from the PHY layer can be leveraged in multi-hop wire-
less settings, to better recover data on opportunistic end-to-end
paths [19]. Approaches such as MIXIT operate on a network-wide
scale by leveraging diversity across multiple nodes. However, such
a scheme also discards symbols received in error, unlike our ap-
proach. Further, our scheme is designed for a single wireless hop.
Transport-layer approaches: Transport layer protocols such as
UDPlite [20], have been designed to allow applications to accept
corrupted data values to recover some content from them. Several
notable efforts [31] have shown that under certain network con-
ditions (e.g., high latency), this leads to a better media streaming
performance. Again, such schemes complement our approach.
Application-layer approaches: There have been several research
efforts to improve the quality of streaming content, mainly at the
application layer through effective data prioritization. The primary
technique in this regard is addition of FEC to different data com-
ponents to make them more resilient than others. A good survey of
such schemes is present in [35]. Other researchers have also studied
hybrid of ARQ-based and FEC-based mechanisms for loss recov-
ery [11, 28]. Authors in [14] and [37] propose speciﬁc architectures
for such cross layered systems. These techniques do not take ad-
vantage of the natural properties of the wireless channel, which we
effectively exploit in Apex.
Prior theoretical studies [23, 16, 10, 33, 2, 27] have explored
the existence of differential error properties at bit positions for in-
dividual constellation maps. Our work augments such theoretical
ﬁndings with design of constellation map switching, data bit place-
ment strategies, and radio RF pipeline modiﬁcations, and evaluates
various nuances through practical implementation on real wireless
hardware and experimentation, and for real media applications.
Finally, other recent work [8, 38] highlight beneﬁts of exploit-
ing differential error resilience of bit positions for video delivery
in unicast and broadcast settings based on numerical simulations.
In particular, authors in [38] propose some modiﬁcations to DVB-
H [1] standard to leverage differential error resilience for terrestrial
broadcast of video. In contrast, Apex explores the notion of ap-
proximate communication through a full system implementation
and extensive experimentation.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Our efforts in this paper has focused on demonstrating that ap-
proximate communication is, indeed, a promising idea. Our results
on the WARP SDR platform shows that our approximate commu-
25nication system, provides signiﬁcant improvement in video quality
(ranging from a 5 dB to 20 dB in different scenarios). However, this
is a small ﬁrst step in realizing the full capability of this system.
We believe this work leaves open a few optimization problems
that should lead to further performance gains.
For example, a joint construction of data modulation schemes
and constellation map selection might lead to further performance
gains. In particular, since our goal is unequal protection of bit po-
sitions, modulation schemes in which constellation points are un-
equally spaced, might be useful to explore.
Similarly, the effect of the buffering induced by Apex, on the
performance needs to be better understood.
A FPGA based implementation of Apex scheme would be neces-
sary for satisfactorily addressing the above. We are currently build-
ing such a system, using which, in future we will explore these and
multiple other issues.
