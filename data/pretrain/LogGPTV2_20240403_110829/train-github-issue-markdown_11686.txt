I encountered an issue while attempting to create a NumPy array from a ctypes structure, which appears to be related to the `_pack_` attribute in ctypes. Has anyone else experienced this problem?

### Code
```python
import sys
import ctypes
import numpy as np

# Print versions for reference
print(sys.version)
print(ctypes.__version__)
print(np.__version__)

# Define a ctypes structure without packing
class POINT(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = [("x", ctypes.c_int),
                ("y", ctypes.c_float)]

# Define a ctypes structure with packing
class POINT_BUG(ctypes.Structure):
    _pack_ = 4
    _fields_ = [("x", ctypes.c_int),
                ("y", ctypes.c_float)]

# Create a NumPy array from the unpacked structure
n = np.array((POINT * 5)())
print(n)

# Attempt to create a NumPy array from the packed structure (this fails)
nb = np.array((POINT_BUG * 5)())
```

### Output
```

    nb = np.array((POINT_BUG * 5)())
TypeError: long() argument must be a string or a number, not 'POINT_BUG'
```

### Explanation
- The code defines two ctypes structures: `POINT` (without packing) and `POINT_BUG` (with packing).
- A NumPy array is successfully created from the `POINT` structure.
- However, creating a NumPy array from the `POINT_BUG` structure results in a `RuntimeWarning` and a `TypeError`.

Has anyone encountered this issue before? Any insights or solutions would be greatly appreciated.
