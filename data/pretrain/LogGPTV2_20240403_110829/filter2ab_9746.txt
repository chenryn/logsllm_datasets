**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Safe Mode Boot

Adversaries may exploit Windows Safe Mode to disable endpoint security measures. Safe Mode is a diagnostic startup mode that initiates the Windows operating system with a minimal set of drivers and services, thereby bypassing non-essential components. This can result in third-party security software, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools, not being activated upon boot.

There are two primary variants of Safe Mode:
- **Safe Mode:** Only essential system drivers and services are loaded.
- **Safe Mode with Networking:** In addition to essential drivers and services, networking components are also enabled.

After booting into Safe Mode, it is possible to manually start additional services, which could further be exploited by adversaries to gain more control over the system.
