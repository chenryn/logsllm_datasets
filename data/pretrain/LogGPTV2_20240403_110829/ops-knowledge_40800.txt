User: I have a caller.py which repeatedly calls routines from some_c_thing.so, which was created from some_c_thing.c.  When I run it, it segfaults - is there a way for me to detect which line of c code is segfaulting?
Assistant: segfault... Check if the number of variables or the types of variables you passed to that c function (in .so) are correct. If not aligned, usually it's a segfault.
