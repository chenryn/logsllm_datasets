### Abstract
Linear single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC-DED) codes, commonly used in the design of reliable memories, are limited in their ability to detect and correct errors with large Hamming weights. This paper proposes a protection scheme for memory devices based on extended Vasil’ev codes. These nonlinear SEC-DED codes have a minimum distance of four, fewer undetectable errors, and fewer miscorrected errors compared to linear codes with the same dimension and redundancy. The extended Vasil’ev codes can provide higher reliability in the presence of repeating errors or high rates of multi-bit upsets. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the application of efficient nonlinear codes for the design of reliable memories. The proposed approach can be applied to RAM, ROM, FLASH, and disk memories with relatively low hardware overhead.

### 1. Introduction
The reliability of memory is a critical consideration for modern digital devices. In some designs, as much as 70% of the chip area is occupied by embedded memory, and this figure is expected to reach 90% by 2011 [25, 12]. This large area is particularly vulnerable to single-event upsets (SEUs), which are caused by energetic particles such as high-energy neutrons and alpha particles. SEUs temporarily alter the state of the devices, resulting in soft errors, which are non-destructive and manifest as unwanted bit flips in memory cells and registers.

Continued scaling of device features and performance increases the likelihood of errors. As the speed of devices increases, the relative size of the clock transition timing window also increases, making devices more sensitive to SEUs [15]. Similarly, decreased voltage levels in modern technologies make bit inversions more likely to occur [8].

The dangers of possible errors in memories due to SEUs are typically mitigated using linear single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC-DED) codes. These codes have a minimum Hamming distance of four and can correct all single-bit errors and detect all double-bit errors. However, in the presence of multi-bit errors, the reliability of systems using error protection schemes based on linear codes may be questionable. For any linear (n, k, d=4) SEC-DED error-correcting code, the number of undetectable multi-bit errors is 2^k. Additionally, a large number of multi-bit errors will be miscorrected. Since SEUs often result in multiple bit distortions, these codes may not be sufficient to ensure high reliability. Anomalies in systems caused by multiple bit upsets (MBUs) have already been reported in [33] and [31].

The increase in MBU rate in deep submicron technologies further exacerbates the situation. In 65nm triple-well SRAMs with a thin cell architecture, the rate of multi-bit errors caused by neutron-induced SEUs increases by a factor of 10 compared to 90nm technologies—nearly 55% of the errors due to neutron radiation are multi-bit errors [11]. Although mechanisms like bit interleaving [23] can be used to minimize the error rate contribution of multi-bit errors, it is unclear whether they are sufficient under such high MBU rates. Moreover, the advantages of bit interleaving come at the cost of additional layout constraints, which may result in higher power consumption and longer access times.

Therefore, memory protection schemes that can provide better protection against multi-bit errors than those based on classical linear codes are in demand. In this paper, we propose a technique for designing reliable memories based on nonlinear SEC-DED partially robust codes. These codes have fewer undetectable errors and fewer multi-bit errors that are always miscorrected, while requiring a hardware overhead comparable to that of conventional linear SEC-DED codes.
