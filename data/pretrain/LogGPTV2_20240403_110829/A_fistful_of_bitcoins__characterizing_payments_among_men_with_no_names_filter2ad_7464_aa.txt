ABSTRACT
Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either phys-
ical commodities or sovereign obligation; instead, it relies on a
combination of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer proto-
col for witnessing settlements. Consequently, Bitcoin has the un-
intuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly
anonymous, its ﬂow is globally visible. In this paper we explore
this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group
Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then us-
ing re-identiﬁcation attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and
services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this anal-
ysis, we characterize longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market,
the stresses these changes are placing on the system, and the chal-
lenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent
purposes at scale.

INTRODUCTION
Demand for low friction e-commerce of various kinds has driven
a proliferation in online payment systems over the last decade.
Thus, in addition to established payment card networks (e.g., Visa
and Mastercard) a broad range of so-called “alternative payments”
has emerged including eWallets (e.g., Paypal, Google Checkout,
and WebMoney), direct debit systems (typically via ACH, such as
eBillMe), money transfer systems (e.g., Moneygram) and so on.
However, virtually all of these systems have the property that they
are denominated in existing ﬁat currencies (e.g., dollars), explic-
itly identify the payer in transactions, and are centrally or quasi-
centrally administered.1
1In particular, there is a central controlling authority who has the
technical and legal capacity to tie a transaction back to a pair of
individuals.

By far the most intriguing exception to this rule is Bitcoin. First
deployed in 2009, Bitcoin is an independent online monetary sys-
tem that combines some of the features of cash and existing online
payment methods. Like cash, Bitcoin transactions do not explicitly
identify the payer or the payee: a transaction is a cryptographically-
signed transfer of funds from one public key to another. Moreover,
like cash, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible (in particular, there is
no chargeback risk as with credit cards). However, unlike cash, Bit-
coin requires third party mediation: a global peer-to-peer network
of participants validates and certiﬁes all transactions; such decen-
tralized accounting requires each network participant to maintain
the entire transaction history of the system, currently amounting to
over 3GB of compressed data. Bitcoin identities are thus pseudo-
anonymous: while not explicitly tied to real-world individuals or
organizations, all transactions are completely transparent.2
This unusual combination of features has given rise to consider-
able confusion about the nature and consequences of the anonymity
that Bitcoin provides. In particular, there is concern that the combi-
nation of scalable, irrevocable, anonymous payments would prove
highly attractive for criminals engaged in fraud or money launder-
ing.
In a widely leaked 2012 Intelligence Assessment, FBI an-
alysts make just this case and conclude that a key “advantage”
of Bitcoin for criminals is that “law enforcement faces difﬁcul-
ties detecting suspicious activity, identifying users and obtaining
transaction records” [7]. Similarly, in a late 2012 report on Vir-
tual Currency Schemes, the European Central Bank opines that the
lack of regulation and due diligence might enable “criminals, ter-
rorists, fraudsters and money laundering” and that “the extent to
which any money ﬂows can be traced back to a particular user is
unknown” [6]. Indeed, there is at least some anecdotal evidence
that this statement is true, with the widely publicized “Silk Road”
service using Bitcoin to trade in a range of illegal goods (e.g., re-
stricted drugs and ﬁrearms). Finally, adding to this urgency is Bit-
coin’s considerable growth, both quantitatively — a merchant ser-
vicer, Bitpay, announced that it had signed up over 1,000 merchants
in 2012 to accept the currency, and in April 2013 the exchange rate
soared to 235 USD per bitcoin before settling to a more modest
100 USD per bitcoin — and qualitatively via integration with ex-
isting payment mechanisms (e.g., Bitinstant offering to tie users’
Bitcoin wallets to Mastercard accounts [5] and Bitcoin Central’s
recent partnership with the French bank Crédit Mutuel Arkéa to
gateway Bitcoin into the banking system [16]) and the increasing
attention of world ﬁnancial institutions (e.g., Canada’s recent deci-
sion to tax Bitcoin transactions [3] and FinCEN’s recent regulations
2Note that this statement is not strictly true since private exchanges
of Bitcoin between customers of a single third party exchange, such
as Mt. Gox, need not (and do not) engage the global Bitcoin proto-
col and are therefore not transparent.
on virtual currencies [8]). In spite of this background of intense in-
terest, Bitcoin’s pseudo-anonymity has limited how much is known
about how the currency is used and how Bitcoin’s use has evolved
over time.
In this context, our work seeks to better understand the trace-
ability of Bitcoin ﬂows and, through this understanding, explore
the evolution in how Bitcoin has been used over time. Importantly,
our goal is not to generally de-anonymize all Bitcoin users — as the
abstract protocol design itself dictates that this should be impossi-
ble — but rather to identify certain idioms of use present in concrete
Bitcoin network implementations that erode the anonymity of the
users who engage in them. Our approach is based on the availabil-
ity of the Bitcoin block chain: a replicated graph data structure that
encodes all Bitcoin activity, past and present, in terms of the public
digital signing keys party to each transaction. However, since each
of these keys carries no explicit information about ownership, our
analysis depends on imposing additional structure on the transac-
tion graph.
Our methodology has two phases. First, in Section 3, we de-
scribe a re-identiﬁcation attack wherein we open accounts and make
purchases from a broad range of known Bitcoin merchants and ser-
vice providers (e.g., Mt. Gox and Silk Road). Since one endpoint
of the transaction is known (i.e., we know which public key we
used), we are able to positively label the public key on the other
end as belonging to the service; we augment this attack by crawl-
ing Bitcoin forums for “self-labeled” public keys (e.g., where an
individual or organization explicitly advertises a key as their own).
Next, in Section 4, we build on past efforts [2, 17, 18, 21] to cluster
public keys based on evidence of shared spending authority. This
clustering allows us to amplify the results of our re-identiﬁcation
attack: if we labeled one public key as belonging to Mt. Gox, we
can now transitively taint the entire cluster containing this public
key as belonging to Mt. Gox as well. The result is a condensed
graph, in which nodes represent entire users and services rather
than individual public keys.
From this data we characterize Bitcoin use longitudinally, focus-
ing in particular on the evolution of services and their role in the
Bitcoin network. Finally, in Section 5, we combine what we have
learned to examine the suitability of Bitcoin for hiding large-scale
illicit transactions. Using the dissolution of a large Silk Road wallet
and notable Bitcoin thefts as case studies, we demonstrate that an
agency with subpoena power would be well placed to identify who
is paying money to whom. Indeed, we argue that the increasing
dominance of a small number of Bitcoin institutions (most notably
services that perform currency exchange), coupled with the pub-
lic nature of transactions and our ability to label monetary ﬂows to
major institutions, ultimately makes Bitcoin unattractive today for
high-volume illicit use such as money laundering.
2. BITCOIN BACKGROUND
Our heuristics that we use to cluster addresses depend on the
structure of the Bitcoin protocol, so we ﬁrst describe it here, and
brieﬂy mention the anonymity that it is intended to provide. Ad-
ditionally, much of our analysis discusses the “major players” and
different categories of bitcoin-based services, so we also present a
more high-level overview of Bitcoin participation, as well as some
general statistics about the Bitcoin network.
January 3 2009. Brieﬂy, a bitcoin3 can be thought of as a chain of
transactions from one owner to the next, where owners are iden-
tiﬁed by a public key (in practice, a public key for the ECDSA
signature scheme) that serves as a pseudonym; i.e., users can use
any number of public keys and their activity using one set of pub-
lic keys is not inherently tied to their activity using another set, or
to their real-world identity (so that, e.g., a user can use a differ-
ent public key to deposit bitcoins into his Silk Road account than
to withdraw bitcoins from his Mt. Gox account, and expect that
these activities cannot be linked to either his real identity or to each
other). In each transaction, the previous owner signs — using the
secret signing key corresponding to his public key — a hash of the
transaction in which he received the bitcoins (in practice, a SHA-
256 hash) and the public key of the next owner. This signature (i.e.,
transaction) can then be added to the set of transactions that con-
stitutes the bitcoin; because each of these transactions references
the previous transaction (i.e., in sending bitcoins, the current owner
must specify where they came from), the transactions form a chain.
To verify the validity of a bitcoin, a user can check the validity of
each of the signatures in this chain.
To prevent double spending, it is necessary for each user in the
system to be aware of all such transactions. Double spending can
then be identiﬁed when a user attempts to transfer a bitcoin after
he has already done so. To determine which transaction came ﬁrst,
transactions are grouped into blocks, which serve to timestamp the
transactions they contain and vouch for their validity. Blocks are
themselves formed into a chain, with each block referencing the
previous one (and thus further reinforcing the validity of all previ-
ous transactions). This process yields a block chain, which is then
publicly available to every user within the system.
This process describes how to transfer bitcoins and broadcast
transactions to all users of the system. Because Bitcoin is decen-
tralized and there is thus no central authority minting bitcoins, we
must also consider how bitcoins are generated in the ﬁrst place. In
fact, this happens in the process of forming a block: each accepted
block (i.e., each block incorporated into the block chain) is required
to be such that, when all the data inside the block is hashed, the
hash begins with a certain number of zeroes. To allow users to ﬁnd
this particular collection of data, blocks contain, in addition to a
list of transactions, a nonce. (We simplify the description slightly
to ease presentation.) Once someone ﬁnds a nonce that allows the
block to have the correctly formatted hash, the block is then broad-
cast in the same peer-to-peer manner as transactions. The system
is designed to generate only 21 million bitcoins in total. Finding
a block currently comes with an attached reward of 25 BTC; this
rate was 50 BTC until November 28 2012 (block height 210,000),
and is expected to halve again in 2016, and eventually drop to 0 in
2140.
In summary, the dissemination of information within the Bitcoin
network is as follows (and as depicted in Figure 1): ﬁrst, users gen-
erate at least one signing keypair, and publicize the public key, or
address — in the rest of the paper we use these terms interchange-
ably — to receive bitcoins (and again, users can choose to use a
single public key or arbitrarily many). If a user has bitcoins that
she wishes to transfer, she broadcasts a transaction, proving that
she has the bitcoins and indicating the address of the recipient to
her peers, who in turn broadcast it to their peers. Eventually, this
transaction reaches a miner, who collects the transactions he hears
about into a block, and works on ﬁnding the right data/nonce bal-
2.1 Bitcoin protocol description
Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic currency, introduced by (the
pseudonymous) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 [15] and deployed on
3Following established convention, we use the capitalized term Bit-
coin when referring to the payment system and peer-to-peer net-
work and the lowercase term bitcoin (abbreviated BTC), when re-
ferring to the unit of currency.
Figure 1: The main players in the Bitcoin landscape.
In (1), a
user wishing to deposit bitcoins into a bank receives a public key,
or address, belonging to the bank.
In (2), the user incorporates
both his own public key and the one sent to him by the bank into
a transaction, which he then broadcasts to his peers. In (3), the
transaction ﬂoods the network. In (4), the transaction is eventually
received by a miner, who works to incorporate the transaction into
a block.
In (5), this block is then ﬂooded through the network,
and in this way is incorporated into the global block chain. The
bitcoins now belong to the public key of the bank, and thus have
been successfully deposited.
ance to hit the target hash. He also includes in the block a special
coin generation transaction that speciﬁes his address for receiving
the block reward. Finally, when the miner does ﬁnd such a block, he
broadcasts it to his peers, who again broadcast it to their peers. As
his reward, the block reward and all the fees for the included trans-
actions are credited to his speciﬁed address. When another block
has been formed, referencing his block as the previous block, his
block can now be considered part of the block chain.
2.2 Participants in the Bitcoin network
In practice, the way in which Bitcoin can be used is much sim-
pler than the above description might indicate. First, generating a
block is so computationally difﬁcult that very few individual users
attempt it on their own. Instead, users may join a mining pool such
as Deepbit, in which they contribute “shares” to narrow down the
search space, and earn a small amount of bitcoins in exchange for
each share.
Users may also avoid coin generation entirely, and simply pur-
chase bitcoins through one of the many exchanges, such as Mt.
Gox. They may then keep the bitcoins in a wallet stored on their
computer or, to make matters even easier, use one of the many wal-
let services (i.e., banks) that exist online (although the two most
popular of these, MyBitcoin and Instawallet, have both shut down
due to thefts).
Finally, to actually spend their bitcoins, users could gamble with
one of the popular dice games such as Satoshi Dice. They could
also buy items from various online vendors, such as Bitmit (“the
eBay of Bitcoin”), the notorious Tor-based service Silk Road, or
with vendors, such as Wordpress, that might ordinarily accept only
US dollars but accept bitcoins through BitPay, a payment gateway
that takes bitcoins from the buyer but offers the option of payment
in USD to the seller (thus eliminating all Bitcoin-based risk for
the vendor). Finally, users wishing to go beyond basic currency
speculation can invest their bitcoins with ﬁrms such as Bitcoinica
(shut down after a series of thefts) or Bitcoin Savings & Trust (later
revealed as a major Ponzi scheme). In Section 3, we more fully
describe the role and impact of these and other services within the
Bitcoin network.

2.3 Bitcoin network statistics
We used the bitcoind client to download the block chain, and
parsed it into a PostgreSQL database using a modiﬁed version of
the bitcointools library developed by Gavin Andresen [1].
We last parsed the block chain on April 13 2013, when there were
231,207 blocks, containing 16,086,073 transactions and 12,056,684
distinct public keys.
