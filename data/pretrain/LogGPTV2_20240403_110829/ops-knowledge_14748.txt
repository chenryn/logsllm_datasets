User: im using a program called CodeRunner to program Python code. I want to install wxpython but how do I figure out what version python im using? when i do python -v in Terminal it says im on 2.7, but is that the same version that CodeRunner is using? Is there a way for me to find out?
Assistant: CodeRunner should work fine with Python 2.7, but you'll have to make sure that a compatible version of wxPython is installed in your site-packages.
To verify that wxPython works correctly, you should start up a python instance in your terminal and run some test code (i.e., import the library and run some of the functions). If this works correctly, then CodeRunner should be able to run that code accordingly (because it uses the same process to run your apps).
