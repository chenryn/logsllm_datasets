Subject: Missing Completed Challenges After Recent Update

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue with my completed challenges on the map, which seems to have occurred after today's update. Specifically, I was working on the "Bonfire: Search and Replace" challenge when I noticed that several of my previously completed challenges are no longer marked as such.

Here is a summary of the challenges I had completed prior to the update:

- All Waypoints up to and including "Object-Oriented & Functional Programming" (excluding "Gear Up for Success," which I believe is a new addition).
- All Basic Algorithm Scripting Bonfires.
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges up to and including challenge 16, except for challenge 15.

While the solutions to these missing challenges are no longer visible in my portfolio, I still retain the brownie points I earned from completing them.

Quincy mentioned on Gitter that we should provide screenshots to help address the issue. I am not entirely sure what specific information is needed, but I have attached a screenshot below for your reference:

Please let me know if there is any additional information or steps I can take to resolve this issue. Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
