Hi,  
A lot of the challenges I had already completed are not checked anymore on my
map, since today's update (I was working on the Bonfire: Search and Replace).  
I originally had completed :
  * all the Waypoints up to Object Oriented & Functional Programming (included) (except the Gear up for success, which I think are new),
  * the Basic Algorithm Scripting Bonfires,
  * the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting up to the 16 (included), except for the 15.
The solutions to the missing challenges are not in my portfolio anymore, but I
still have all the brownie points I won by completing them.
Quincy told us on Gitter to put up screencap, I'm not sure of what (since it's
missing stuffs), so I hope this will do :
