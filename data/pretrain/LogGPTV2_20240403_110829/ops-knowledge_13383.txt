User: I have a directory which hosts all of my Django apps (C:\My_Projects). I want to add this directory to my PYTHONPATH so I can call the apps directly.
I tried adding C:\My_Projects\; to my Windows Path variable from the Windows GUI (My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables). But it still doesn't read the coltrane module and generates this error:

Error: No module named coltrane
Assistant: To augment PYTHONPATH, run regedit and navigate to KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore and then select the folder for the python
version you wish to use. Inside this is a folder labelled PythonPath,
with one entry that specifies the paths where the default install
stores modules. Right-click on PythonPath and choose to create a new
key. You may want to name the key after the project whose module
locations it will specify; this way, you can easily compartmentalize
and track your path modifications.
thanks
