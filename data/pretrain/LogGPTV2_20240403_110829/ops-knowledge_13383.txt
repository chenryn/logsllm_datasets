To add your Django apps directory (C:\My_Projects) to the `PYTHONPATH`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Using Environment Variables:**
   - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables."
   - Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   - In the Environment Variables window, find the `PYTHONPATH` variable in the "System variables" section. If it does not exist, you will need to create it.
     - To create a new `PYTHONPATH` variable, click on "New," enter `PYTHONPATH` as the variable name, and set the value to `C:\My_Projects`.
     - If the `PYTHONPATH` variable already exists, select it and click on "Edit." Append `;C:\My_Projects` to the existing value, ensuring that each path is separated by a semicolon.
   - Click "OK" to close all windows and apply the changes.

2. **Using the Windows Registry (Advanced):**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Windows Registry Editor.
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore` and then select the folder for the Python version you are using (e.g., `3.9`).
   - Inside this folder, locate the `PythonPath` key. If it does not exist, you may need to create it.
     - Right-click on the Python version folder, select "New" > "Key," and name it `PythonPath`.
     - Right-click on the newly created `PythonPath` key, select "New" > "String Value," and name it appropriately (e.g., `My_Projects`).
     - Double-click the new string value and set its data to `C:\My_Projects`.
   - Close the Registry Editor and restart any open command prompts or IDEs to ensure the changes take effect.

3. **Verify the Changes:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt or terminal and run the following command to check if the `PYTHONPATH` has been updated:
     ```sh
     echo %PYTHONPATH%
     ```
   - Ensure that `C:\My_Projects` is included in the output.

4. **Test the Import:**
   - Try importing the `coltrane` module in a Python script or interactive session to verify that the path is correctly set:
     ```python
     import coltrane
     ```

If you still encounter the error `No module named coltrane`, double-check the following:
- Ensure that the `coltrane` module is located in the `C:\My_Projects` directory.
- Verify that the directory structure and file names are correct.
- Make sure there are no typos in the `PYTHONPATH` or the module name.

By following these steps, you should be able to add your Django apps directory to the `PYTHONPATH` and successfully import the `coltrane` module.
