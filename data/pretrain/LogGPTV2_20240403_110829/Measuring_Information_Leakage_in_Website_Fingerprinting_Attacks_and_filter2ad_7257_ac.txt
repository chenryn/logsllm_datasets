### Feature Selection and Information Leakage

**Approach Overview:**
Our second approach involves selecting a subset of the most informative features to approximate the overall information leakage. Instead of measuring the information leakage of all features, we focus on the top *n* features that leak the most information about the visited websites. The results of this approach, as *n* varies, are illustrated in Figures 8 and 12. As *n* increases, the information leakage from the top *n* features initially rises but eventually plateaus. This indicates that a sufficient number of top informative features can effectively approximate the information leakage of the entire feature set. This observation is supported by [22], which found that including more than 100 top informative features provides minimal additional gain for classification.

**Dimension Reduction Methods:**
We did not choose other dimension reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [23]. Our goal is to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in modeling website fingerprints using AKDE. However, PCA transforms website fingerprints into opaque components, which are less interpretable. More importantly, our experimental results show poor performance with PCA. Figure 4 illustrates the percentage of variance retained when PCA reduces the dimension from 3043 to 100. The percentage of variance is a common metric for estimating information loss in PCA. The figure shows that reducing the dimension to 100 retains less than 50% of the variance, indicating significant information loss. Therefore, PCA is not suitable for our case.

### Experimental Results

**Mutual Information Analyzer:**
Figure 5 presents the results from our Mutual Information Analyzer. We selected the 100 most informative features (excluding redundant ones) and applied the analyzer to obtain 6 clusters. The figure shows the contribution of each category to the clusters and the cluster to which each feature belongs.

**Redundant Features:**
We found that redundant features are prevalent among the highly informative ones. Out of the 183 most informative features, 45.36% are redundant. This suggests that future feature set engineering could potentially prune many redundant features without significantly affecting the performance of website fingerprinting.

**Feature Clustering:**
Figure 5 also reveals that a cluster may include features from different categories. For example, Cluster2 contains features from categories 1, 8, and 14, while Cluster3 includes features from categories 1, 3, and 14. This indicates that features from different categories can share significant information, leading to their clustering together. Additionally, features from the same category are not necessarily in the same cluster. For instance, category 4 features are distributed across three different clusters.

**Information Loss:**
It is important to note that some categories lack top informative features, resulting in their absence in the clusters. While WeFDE does involve some information loss, it is minimal compared to other dimension reduction methods like PCA [22]. Even if certain categories or features are not chosen by WeFDE, their information may still be represented by other included categories or features.

**Redundancy with Total Packet Count:**
Among the 83 redundant features, 33 are redundant with the total packet count. These features include incoming packet count and 2-gram (-1,-1), but exclude outgoing packet count (NMI between total and outgoing packet count is 0.4414). This is because the number of incoming packets is much higher than the number of outgoing packets in web browsing, making the total packet count highly dependent on the incoming packet count.

### Closed-World Information Leakage

**Setting and Measurement:**
In a closed-world setting, an attacker is assumed to know the possible websites a user may visit. The information leakage in this context pertains to identifying the specific website. Appendix D provides more details on how to calculate this information. In our measurement, we used Alexa's top 100 websites with 55,779 visits. We assumed equal prior probabilities for the websites and set the Monte Carlo sample number to 5,000. We measured the individual and joint information leakage of 3,043 features. The measurements were conducted on a workstation with 32 cores (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz). A typical measurement, like the one described here, can be completed within 10 hours. Full measurement results are available in our anonymous GitHub repository.

**Individual Information Leakage:**
Figure 6 displays the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the individual features' information leakage. Among the 3,043 features, we found:
- 2.1% of features leak more than 3 bits of information, allowing an attacker to narrow down the possibilities to one-eighth.
- 19.91% of features leak between 2 and 3 bits of information.
- 23.43% of features leak between 1 and 2 bits of information.
- 54.55% of features leak less than 1 bit of information.

The maximum information leakage observed was 3.45 bits from the rounded outgoing packet count feature. Rounding the packet count increased the information leakage, confirming the findings in [36] that rounding can aid website fingerprinting attacks.

**Asymmetric Traffic:**
Web browsing is characterized by asymmetric traffic, with incoming packets outnumbering outgoing packets. Despite this, the download stream (incoming packets) leaks 3.04 bits of information, 0.22 bits less than the upload stream (outgoing packets). This suggests that defense designs should pay at least as much attention to the upload stream as to the download stream when hiding packet counts.

**Timing Features:**
The most informative timing feature is the average inter-packet timing for the download stream, with 1.43 bits of leakage. Among inter-packet timing features, the maximum timing feature leaks the least information, around 0.7 bits. Transmission time features show increasing information leakage from the 25th percentile to the 100th percentile, with the total transmission time leaking 1.21 bits of information. The information leakage of timing features is similar for both upload and download streams.

**Impact of World Size:**
We also examined the impact of world size on individual feature information leakage. We used Alexa's top 500 and top 1000 websites separately for the closed-world setting and conducted the same information leakage measurements. The information leakage upper bounds for world sizes of 100, 500, and 1000 are 6.64, 8.97, and 9.97 bits, respectively. Our findings, shown in Figure 7, indicate that the impact of world size on information leakage is minimal. Specifically, when the world size increases from 500 to 1000, the individual information leakage remains almost the same. Further analysis is provided in Appendix F.
