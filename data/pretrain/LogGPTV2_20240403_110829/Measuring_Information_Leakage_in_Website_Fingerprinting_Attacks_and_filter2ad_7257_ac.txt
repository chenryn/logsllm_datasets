one of the features and keeping the other.
Our second approach is to pick out a number of the most infor-
mative features to approximate all features’ information leakage.
Given a set of features to measure, we sort the features by their
individual information leakage. Instead of measuring all features’
information leakage, we pick out top n features that leak the most
information about the visited websites. The measurement results
by varying n are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 12. It shows that
with n increasing, the top n features’ information leakage would in-
crease at ﬁrst but ﬁnally reach a plateau. This phenomenon shows
that the information leakage of suﬃcient top informative features
is able to approximate that of the overall features. Such observation
is also backed by [22], which discovered that including more top
informative features beyond 100 had little gain for classiﬁcation.
We didn’t choose other dimension reduction methods such as
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [23]. Our goal is to mitigate
the curse of dimensionality in modelling website ﬁngerprints by
AKDE; but methods like PCA transform website ﬁngerprints into
opaque components which are much less understandable. More im-
portantly, our experimental results demonstrate the poor perfor-
mance of PCA. Figure 4 shows that the percentage of variance re-
tained when PCA reduces to a speciﬁc dimension. Note that the
percentage of variance is the popular approach to estimate the in-
formation loss in PCA. It displays that if our goal is to reduce the
dimension from 3043 to 100, the percentage of variance retained af-
ter PCA is under 50%, indicating high information loss. Thus, PCA
doesn’t ﬁt in our case.
The Results. Figure 5 displays the outcome of our Mutual Informa-
tion Analyzer. We pick out 100 most informative features (exclud-
ing the redundant ones), and we apply Mutual Information Ana-
lyzer to obtain 6 clusters. Figure 5 shows how many features each
category contributes, and which cluster the feature belongs to.
We ﬁnd that redundant features are pervasive among the highly
informative features. We look at 183 most informative features, and
45.36% of them are redundant. This phenomenon suggests future
feature set engineering may be able to ﬁnd many redundant fea-
tures to prune without hurting its performance for website ﬁnger-
prints.
Figure 5 shows a cluster may consist of features from diﬀerent
categories. For example, Cluster2 has features from category 1, 8,
and 14, and Cluster3 has features from category 1, 3, and 14. This
phenomenon shows features from diﬀerent categories may share
much information (that’s why they are clustered together). Figure
5 also shows features from same category are not necessarily in

redundant 100 features.
the same cluster. For instance, the category 4 features are clustered
into three diﬀerent clusters.
Figure 5 also shows that categories do not necessarily have fea-
tures to be included in clusters. We ﬁnd that some categories lack
top informative features, ending up with absence of their features
in clusters. Here, we clarify that we don’t claim WeFDE to be free
of information loss. In fact, just like other dimension reduction ap-
proaches such as PCA, there is information loss in WeFDE, but it is
minimal [22]. It’s also worth noting that though some categories or
features are not chosen by WeFDE, this doesn’t necessarily mean
all of their information is lost, as their information may be shared
and represented by other included categories or features.
Looking at 83 redundant features, we ﬁnd 33 of them are re-
dundant with total packet count. These features include incoming
packet count and 2-gram (-1,-1), but exclude outgoing packet count
(NMI between total and outgoing packet count is 0.4414). The rea-
son is that the number of incoming packets are much more than
the number of outgoing packets in website browsing, so that total
packet count is highly dependent on incoming packet count.
Due to page limit, we release all our measurement results in our
GitHub repository.

6 CLOSED-WORLD INFORMATION LEAKAGE
In closed-world setting, an attacker is assumed to know the possi-
ble websites that a user may visit. The information leakage under
this setting comes to which website is visited. Appendix D gives
more details about how to calculate this information. In the mea-
surement, We adopt Alexa top 100 websites with 55779 visits in our
closed-world setting, as is shown in Table 1. We assume equal prior
probability for websites, and we set Monte Carlo sample number
to 5000. We measure 3043 features’ individual information leakage
and their joint leakage by categories. We run this measurement
and the following ones of this paper on a workstation with 32 cores
(Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz). The measurement time
diﬀers depending on the settings, but a typical measurement like
the setting here can be ﬁnished within 10 hours. The following in-
troduces part of our results. Full measurement results can be found
at our anonymous GitHub repository.
Individual Information Leakage. Our measurement results
upon individual features are shown in Figure 6. Among these 3043
features, we ﬁnd: (a) 2.1% features leak more than 3 bits informa-
tion, meaning that an attacker is able to narrow down the possibil-
ities to one eighth by any of these features; (b) 19.91% features leak
less than 3 bit but more than 2 bits information; (c) 23.43% features
leak 1 bit to 2 bits information; and (d) 54.55% features leak less
than 1 bit information. It is clear that nearly half of the features
are able to help an attacker to reduce the size of the anonymity set
by half. Yet our experiment shows that a single feature leaks no
more than 3.45 bits information, which is the maximum leakage
we observe in our experiment from the feature of rounded out-
going packet count. We also observe that outgoing packet count
without rounding leaks 3.26 bits information, 0.19 bit less than the
rounded one. We observe similar information leakage increase by
rounding for total packet count and incoming packet count. Our
results conﬁrm the observation in [36] that rounding packet count
can help website ﬁngerprinting attacks.
Web-browsing is characterized by asymmetric traﬃc. The in-
coming packets, which contain the requested contents, usually out-
number the outgoing packets carrying the request. A natural ques-
tion is, does download stream having more packets leak more in-
formation than upload stream? The answer is no: download stream
leaks 3.04 bits information, 0.22 bit less than the incoming stream.
Our measurement suggests that defense design should give no less
(if not more) attention to upload stream in hiding both streams’
packet count.
The most informative timing feature is the average of inter-packet
timing for download stream with 1.43 bit leakage. Among inter-
packet timing features, the maximum leaks the least information
with around 0.7 bit leakage. Another category of timing features
is transmission time. We observe that the information leakage in-
creases from 25% percentile to 100% percentile transmission time.
The most information leakage for transmission time comes to the
total transmission time, which leaks 1.21 bit information. Further-
more, our measurement shows that information leakage of timing
features has little diﬀerence for upload and download stream.
We also experiment the impact of world size on individual fea-
ture’s information leakage. We try to answer: with a larger world
size, whether the information leakage of indiviual features increases
or decreases. We further adopt Alexa top 500 and top 1000 sep-
arately for closed-world setting, and we conduct the same infor-
mation leakage measurement as above. Note that the information
leakage upper bound under the world size 100, 500, and 1000 is
6.64, 8.97, and 9.97 bits, respectively. Our ﬁnding is that the im-
pact of world size on information leakage is minimal, as is shown
in Figure 7. Particularly, when the world size increases from 500
to 1000, the features’ individual information leakage is almost the
same. Further analysis will be given in Appendix F.
