B.2 Dataset overlap by activity level
Expanding the results from Section 4, Table 4 captures how much
of each dataset’s activity volumes are from the ASes that overlap
other datasets (i.e., the ASes from Table 3). Columns cache probing
and cache probing ∪ DNS logs do not have a row since they do
not have a measure of volume. The DNS logs column captures
how much activity from each other dataset is from ASes inferred
as active by our DNS logs technique. Although our DNS logs
technique only uncovers 74.2% of the APNIC ASes, those ASes
account for 97.6% of the world’s Internet population, according to
APNIC estimates. The ASes we identify as hosting clients account
for 98.8% of the Microsoft clients queries and 100.0% of the
Microsoft resolvers client IP addresses (compared to 92.0% and
95.7% for APNIC).

Figure 6: Distribution of relative volume among ASes for three meth-
ods of measuring AS client activity. DNS logs results in similar client
activity estimates to Microsoft resolvers, which makes sense since
they both rely on signals from recursive resolvers.
B.3 Comparing relative activity by AS
Although we leave relative activity estimates for client prefixes
largely as future work (§6), we present preliminary analysis of one
activity estimate—DNS logs, since DNS logs provides the num-
ber of Chromium queries as a direct per-resolver relative activity
measure. We compare this relative measure to two other relative
measures—the number of IP addresses using a recursive resolver
(Microsoft resolvers) and the estimated Internet population of
an AS (APNIC). In our contemporaneous work [20], we present
preliminary methods to adding activity estimates to our cache
probing methodology.
As an aggregated view of all activity estimates, Figure 6 shows
the distribution across ASes of estimates of client activity using
three methods (DNS logs, APNIC, Microsoft resolvers). DNS
logs and Microsoft resolvers have similar relative distributions,
whereas APNIC tends to have far fewer ASes with smaller numbers
of Internet users.
To supplement the aggregate view in Figure 6, Figure 7 shows the
difference in an AS’s relative activity levels as estimated by different
approaches. The datasets disagree by at most 1e-5 for 90% of ASes,
suggesting all three datasets would roughly group all ASes into
similar levels of client activity. Again, we see DNS logs is the most
similar to Microsoft resolvers, which makes sense since DNS
logs measures activity by recursive. In particular, we expect APNIC
estimates to differ from DNS logs and Microsoft resolvers when
clients use a resolver outside their AS. For example, Google public
DNS clients are likely not in the same AS as that service. In this
case, both DNS logs (.5%) and Microsoft resolvers (20%) would
assign a higher weight to Google’s AS, whereas APNIC (9e-6%)
would likely distribute this weight over the ASes whose users use
Google public DNS.

the Alexa top sites global list that both support ECS (as of 9/26/2021)
and have TTLs longer than 60 seconds: www.google.com (rank
1), www.youtube.com (rank 2), facebook.com (rank 7), and
www.wikipedia.org (rank 13). Facebook only supports ECS when
www is not included. In addition to domains selected from the
Alexa top sites global list, we also probed a popular Microsoft
CDN domain that supports ECS and used its ECS traces. We use
Microsoft logs of clients accessing this domain to validate our
cache probing technique. In the main body we present results for
cache probing aggregated across all these domains.
Table 5 provides results on how well each individual domain
performs in discovering activity at prefix and AS granularities (top),
and cross-comparing each pair of domains (bottom). Since different
domains may reply with different response scopes, we treat prefixes
returned by different domains as matching as long as one prefix
contains the other. Although Wikipedia has many fewer active
prefixes than other domains, we identify a large number of unique
ASes by probing Wikipedia. Wikipedia returns fewer prefixes
because it usually replies with response scopes between 16 and 18
while the rest of the domains usually reply with scopes between
20 and 24. We identify the largest number of unique prefixes and
ASes by probing for Google, possibly due to the site’s popularity
and wide-spread usage. Conversely, we identify relatively few new
prefixes and ASes by probing for YouTube, despite its popularity
as #2 on Alexa top sites global list and the large number of active
prefixes found by probing it. This lack of new information is largely
explained by the overlap of active prefixes between Google and
YouTube, as 89% of active prefixes discovered with YouTube are also

the three methods of measuring AS client activity. DNS logs results
in similar client activity estimates to Microsoft resolvers, which
makes sense since they both rely on an intermediate signal from a
recursive resolver.

found in Google. Finally, we discovered that probing Facebook does
not add many new prefixes or ASes. We attribute this to the fact
that Facebook only supports ECS without www. Since Facebook
uses its domain with www by default, the version without www may
be queried less often by real users.
