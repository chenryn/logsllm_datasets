MaxiDed admins listed offers as well in the role of a merchant
on their own platform. We label MaxiDed as merchant zero
(mc0) and 14 third-party merchants as mc1...14, identiﬁed by
connecting MaxiDed’s user and supplier database tables.
Figure 3: Merchant Package Offerings. (left) All packages; (right)
Subset of illicit packages
Figure 3 (left) illustrates the total number of server pack-
ages offered by the top 4 merchants, which accounted for 98%
of all packages. At the moment of takedown (May 2018), there
were 3,957 available packages. Of these, 2,921 (74%) explic-
itly allowed abuse. Packages expired when corresponding
upstream provider packages expired or when operators no
longer maintained relationships with the upstreams.
Figure 3 (right) shows the subset of server packages that
allowed abuse, from the same top four merchants. This ﬁgure
highlights that two merchants, mc4 and mc14 were responsible
for 89% of all the BP packages offered on MaxiDed’s plat-
form and 94% of the BP packages available at the moment
of the takedown. Interestingly, MaxiDed itself (mc0) supplied
only 29 BP packages (1%), relying almost exclusively on its
merchants to supply BP infrastructure. This ﬁts with our inter-
pretation that moving to a platform model allowed MaxiDed
to externalize the risk and cost of managing the relationships
with upstream providers around abusive practices.
Of the 14,931 BP packages on offer, only 3,066 (20%)

This indicates that there was an oversupply of BP packages
on MaxiDed. Sales followed a similar distribution to supply,
with mc4 and mc14 accounting for 70% of all sales. (Of the
packages that did not explicitly allow abuse, 2,006 were sold
4,832 times.)
In sum, only around 20% of offers were ever sold, show-
ing that the market for BPH is, unfortunately, not supply-
constrained. MaxiDed externalized the supply of BP pack-
ages to merchants and two of these were dominant, in terms
of supply and sales. Merchants mc4 and mc14 would have
been viable candidates for disrupting the supply chain of
the marketplace as a whole, had they been identiﬁed prior
to MaxiDed’s takedown. This might be feasible if, as prior
work assumed, they are resellers of upstream providers and
WHOIS records are updated to show which network blocks
are delegated to them. We later discuss evidence that, in most
cases, there is no such delegation. The takedown of MaxiDed
itself is unlikely to have disrupted these merchants. They may
have taken some losses from outstanding due payments from
MaxiDed. Except for these losses, merchants could migrate
to other marketplaces, resulting in a game of whack-a-mole.
This demonstrates the advantages of merchants externalizing
part of their risks to the MaxiDed platform.
7.2 BP Package Categories
BP packages were differentiated in terms of what types of
abuse was allowed. The platform pre-deﬁned 12 categories of
abusive activities. Merchants could tick the boxes of whatever
categories they were comfortable with for their packages. The
activities ranged from the distribution of pornographic con-
tent or copyrighted material, to Internet-wide scanning, run-
ning counterfeit pharmacies, running automated spamming
software such as Xrumer, and doing IP spooﬁng, typically
to conduct ampliﬁcation DDoS attacks. Table 3 lists these
activities along with associated category labels C1..12.
We suspect merchant choices for certain types of abuse to
have been partly driven by what they could handle in terms
of their relationship with the upstream provider of a package.
Some forms of abuse
trigger more backlash
than others. Plus, cer-
tain upstreams might be
less vigilant regarding
certain forms of abuse,
depending on jurisdic-
tion or other factors.
To analyze the rela-
tionships among the al-
lowed forms of abuse,
we calculate the corre-
lations between all cat-
egories. In other words,
Figure 4: Correlation of abuse cate-
gories. (See Table 3 for ci labels).
if category ’cX’ is allowed, what is the probability that cate-
gory ’cY ’ is also allowed? The results are plotted in Figure 4.
Five groups of server packages can be identiﬁed, each with
a different type of abuse proﬁle, which roughly corresponds
to a certain risk proﬁle. At the top end of the risk proﬁle
is "spooﬁng" (x = c12). Where this was allowed, everything
else was also allowed with high probability (i.e., all values
along the y-axis indicate high probability for x = c12). As
such a highest risk group label G5 was assigned to packages
that allow "spooﬁng". One step down are packages that allow
"scanning" (x = c11): everything else is typically allowed,
except "spooﬁng" (x = c11,y = c12), which has a lower prob-
ability. This is group G4. Next, G3 was assigned to a group
composed of 4 categories, C7..10 which were allowed in con-
junction with a high probability, and disallowed the higher
risk c11..12 categories with a high probability. The remaining
groups were created using a similar logic.

Table 3: Statistics on packages allowing each category of illicit
activity and associated risk groups
For each risk group, Table 3 lists the abuse types and the
number of packages that allowed it, over the whole period of
MaxiDed (’all packages’) or at the moment of the takedown
(’Avail. before takedown’). Note that packages are counted
multiple times, as they often allowed multiple forms of abuse.
The last column, ’Avail. per group’, counts each package as
belonging uniquely to one group, namely the group with the
highest risk proﬁle – e.g., if a package allows spooﬁng, it will
be counted in G5, but not in others, even though it likely also
allows those types of activities. We can see that MaxiDed had
a signiﬁcant amount of supply in each category, with a clear
peak in group 3.
A side note: the tickets and live chats clearly showed that
other types of abuse were also allowed, such as running botnet
C&C servers. The admins did not wish to list these forms of
abuse publicly (see Figure 15 in S.14 Appendix-A).
7.3 Merchant Upstream Providers
To understand how MaxiDed’s supply of BP infrastructure was
distributed over legitimate upstream providers, we narrowed
our analysis to 5 merchants, namely mc0, mc4, mc10, mc12,

allocation to downstream entities. Note that these downstream
entities might also be legitimate resellers who sold to the mer-
chants, rather than being the merchants themselves. Also,
none of the records pointed to MaxiDed. This means that in
76% of the cases, the BP activities could not be associated
with a sub-allocation, thus evading the current best detection
method. Abuse on these addresses would be counted against
the upstream provider, typically diluting the detectable con-
centration of abuse. Establishing a relationship between the
upstream provider, their downstream customers, merchants
and, ultimately, MaxiDed, would have been impossible with
this kind of data.
and mc14, who jointly had 94% of the BP package sales.

to which these IP address
belonged. This way, we could see how each merchant’s
supply chain was composed of multiple upstream providers.
The variance was signiﬁcant. The two dominant merchants
(mc10 and mc14) abused 134 and 276 upstream providers,
respectively. The others connected with 4 to 26 upstreams.
Overall, MaxiDed’s supply chain comprised of servers at 394
upstream providers.
Figure 5 show how much, or rather how little, the supply
chains of merchants overlapped in terms of upstreams. Fig-
ure 6 shows a CDF of how each merchant’s sold BP servers
were distributed across its own set of upstream providers.
Across all merchants, 15 upstream hosted 50% of all sold BP
servers and 57 account for 80% of all sold servers.
At ﬁrst glance, the con-
centration in 15 upstream
providers suggests a choke-
point that could be leveraged,
but the long tail of available
upstreams makes this strat-
egy not very promising. Mer-
chants could shift supply to
those hundreds of alternatives.
The 15 top ones might have

tion over Upstream Providers
location, price and quality, but
only 5 of them are shared between the two top merchants,
so there does not seem to be a unique advantage to these
providers.
Recent BPH detection approaches [5] have relied on up-
stream providers updating WHOIS records when they dele-
gate network blocks to resellers. As stated, our data suggested
that merchants often do not enter into reseller agreements
with upstream. That would seriously undermine the effec-
tiveness of these detection methods. To test this more sys-
tematically, we looked at the set of upstream providers that
hosted 80% of the BP servers (57). In this set, we found 22
which are reputable upstream providers and more likely to
reﬂect sub-allocations to their clients in WHOIS. We ran-
domly sampled 10 BP servers for each of these 22 providers
and manually inspected their IP WHOIS information. In only
Figure 7: 10 most misused upstream providers via which mc14
provisioned BP servers of risk group G4 (allowing “scanning” - left)
and G5 (“spooﬁng’ - right’), plotted against server lifespans at each
provider. Each colored line represents the lifespan of one server.
We next examined the distribution of each merchants’ sold
BP servers and server life spans across their corresponding
upstream providers longitudinally. We visualize some of the
results for mc14, who was specialized in selling higher risk BP
servers. Figure 7 plots the lifespan of mc14’s sold BP servers
that allowed "scanning" (left) and "spooﬁng" (right) for its 10
most misused upstream providers.
Figure 7 demonstrates that the merchant’s BP customer
servers were spatially as well as temporally spread across
multiple upstream providers. It also shows that at no point
in time, was there a shortage in the supply of servers even
for the higher risk server packages. We observe no timeline
gap during which servers of a particular group were not pro-
visioned and active. We clearly observe a supply chain that
was diversiﬁed, yet proportionally concentrated on a limited
set of upstream providers. This approach of the merchant
seems to be driven by a combination of efﬁciency in working
with a limited set of upstreams and the ﬂexibility of migrating
from one upstream to the next, once the cost of working with
that provider went up, perhaps because of mounting abuse
complaints.

Next, we analyze the various payment instruments to iden-
tify potential chokepoints. From analyzing the source code
of the webshop and the transactions in the database, we
know that MaxiDed accepted payments via 23 different instru-
ments. Three of these were actually never used by customers:
Bitcoin Gold, Electroneum and Kubera Coin. Eight pay-
ment options were provided for a limited time and then discon-
tinued by MaxiDed. At the moment of its takedown, 12 pay-
ment options were available. Some of these instruments, e.g.,
Paypal, were later restricted to speciﬁc groups of customers.
Payments through Yandex Money were generally restricted
to clients from Russia.
