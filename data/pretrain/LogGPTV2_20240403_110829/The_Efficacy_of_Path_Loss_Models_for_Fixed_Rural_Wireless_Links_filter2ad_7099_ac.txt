Model Name
Fig. 5. Prediction Error Skewness, computed as the sum of error divided by the number
of total links. Models that make an equal amount of over and under predictions acheive
a value near zero. Models that make a majority of under or over predictions have a
large negative or positive value respectively.
zero indicates no correlation (random order) and a value of 1.0 or -1.0 indicates
perfect positive or negative correlation. We can see that with few exceptions,
all models score in the neighborhood of 0.25 to 0.30 indicating a small positive
correlation. The best model (hatam.egli) performs around 0.45 and the worst
model (itu.terrain) acheives less than 0.20 correlation.
Our ﬁnal metric is skewness, which is shown in ﬁgure 5. For many applica-
tions an over or under estimate of path loss can come with a high price. This
metric plots the sum of all residual error for each model. A model that makes
an equal amount of over and under estimations should produce a skewness of
0. A model that systematically over-predicts path loss (i.e., under-predicts the
received signal strength at sites) will have a large positive value and a model
that systematically under-predicts path loss will have a large negative value.
We see that even in the mean case, the best models, with their best parameter
settings cannot achieve an error of less than 15 dB—ﬁve orders of magnitude
from the correct value! Even our more permissive performance metrics show the

models are unable to widely succeed at seemingly simple tasks of rank-ordering
links, or making predictions within two standard deviations of the measured
value. This raises the question: is there some common source of error that is
aﬀecting all models?
To answer this question, we analyzed the covariance (correlation) between
“best prediction error” (the error of the best prediction from all models) and
various possible factors. We found no signiﬁcant correlation between carrier fre-
quency (and therefore neither modulation scheme nor protocol) or antenna ge-
ometry. We did however ﬁnd that link distance is signiﬁcantly correlated with
error for a large number of models. This makes sense: many models were de-
signed with particular lengths of links in mind and we are using them outside
of their coverage in this study. It also raises the question: can a hybrid model
which uses one of two or more other models at diﬀerent link lengths produce a
model which is better performing than any single model alone?
To answer this question, we implemented two hybrid models. The ﬁrst uses
the Hata model (for medium cities) for links under 500m (where it is well
performing) and the Flat-edge model (with 10 “buildings”) for longer links
(hatam.ﬂatedge10). This model performs marginally better than all other mod-
els, producing a corrected RMSE of 14.3 dB. Very slightly better performance
is achieved by combining the Hata model with the Egli Model (14.2 dB RMSE).
It is interesting to note that in our analysis the best performing models would
not typically be chosen for this environment. The two best performing individual
models are Flat-Edge and Alsebrook. The Flat-Edge model attempts to calculate
the path loss after the signal diﬀracts over some number of interfering “screens”.
Here, we pick 10 as the number of screens and obtain decent results, better in
fact than the models which take the true terrain proﬁle into account when they
make predictions. The Alsebrook model is a simple plane-earth (two-ray) model
with some corrections from measurements and an optional static correction for
terrain “roughness”. In the version that performs best for our measurements,
we arbitrarily set the terrain “roughness” to 200m and the “street width” and
average “building height” to the suggested default values of 5 and 20m. Perhaps
comporting with Occam’s Razor, the simplest models (Friis, Egli, Two-Ray) are
often as well performing and in many cases better performing than the more
complex models with respect to our metrics.
6 Conclusion
Overall our results show that even with the best models, hand-tuned for our
environment, we can expect an RMSE in excess of 12 dB (4 orders of magnitude
from correct and a far cry from the 3 dB repeated-measures variation which
we treat as the gold standard [7])—a result that precludes use in all but the
least demanding applications. More forgiving performance metrics show similarly
bleak results: no model is able to obtain better than 25% of predictions within
two standard deviations of the true value and the best models are typically 20%
wrong when it comes to placing links in an order relative to all other links.
On The Eﬃcacy of Path Loss Models
51
We have also shown that picking a “good looking” model at random from the
literature and applying it to a new (or even seemingly congruent) domain is a
precarious task which can produce substantially wrong predictions. Given this,
we believe attempts to model path loss in even more complex environments, such
as indoors, are premature. Instead, we advocate a renewed focus on rigorous
cross validation using publicly available data sets. We also caution users of these
models to be wary of their predictions and to do in-situ validation whenever
possible. In future work we expect to explore more complex models for path loss
prediction such as those that make use of active correction from measurements
(e.g., [8]).
