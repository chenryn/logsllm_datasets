This cmd was run and the resource is configured as described: 

sudo pcs resource create ag_cluster ocf:mssql:ag ag_name=ag1 meta failure-timeout=30s --master meta notify=true

Assistant: pcs resource create ag_cluster ocf:mssql:ag ag_name=my_ag1 meta failure-timeout=30s master notify=true

remove the -- before master.  Microsoft f'ed up their documentation :)
