User: How to effectively monitor application logs so that problems can be discovered and resolved in a timely manner? Please provide a reasonable log monitoring solution.
Assistant: Effective monitoring of application logs and timely discovery and resolution of problems are important means to ensure business stability. The following is a reasonable log monitoring solution: 1. Choose an appropriate log management platform, such as Elastic Stack, Splunk, Graylog, etc. 2. Set log collection rules. The log collection rules must ensure that all logs of the application are collected, including general application logs, system logs, and error logs. 3. Set the alarm rules. According to the characteristics of the application and business requirements, set reasonable alarm rules, such as setting the number of consecutive occurrences of the error log to issue an alarm, etc. In addition, the alarm level can also be set, and the alarm is divided into two levels: warning and emergency. 4. Regularly analyze logs. Regularly analyze logs on a daily or weekly basis to see if there are any abnormalities, such as whether there are abnormal error logs, whether the traffic is normal, etc. If any abnormal situation is found, take timely measures to solve the problem. 5. Real-time monitoring. You can keep abreast of the running status of the application by monitoring the logs in real time. If an abnormal situation is found, you can quickly deal with the problem. 6. Save history log. It is necessary to save the historical logs so that they can be easily found when they need to be queried in the future. Periodic deletion of expired logs can be set to save storage space. The above is a reasonable log monitoring solution, which can help managers understand the application status, handle abnormal situations in a timely manner, and improve application stability and reliability.
