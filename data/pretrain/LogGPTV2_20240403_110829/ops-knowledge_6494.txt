User: When I double-click on pycharm.sh, Ubuntu lets me choose between "Run in Terminal" and "Run". What is the difference between these options?
Assistant: I did the edit and added the PATH for my Pycharm in .bashrc but I was still getting the error "pycharm.sh: command not found".
After trying several other things the following command resolved the issue which creates a symbolic link.
sudo ln -s /snap/pycharm-community/267/bin/pycharm.sh /usr/local/bin/pycharm
The first is location to the exact path to pycharm.sh and the second is user bin which should be on PATH env by default
