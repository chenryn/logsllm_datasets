Currently it is impossible to access owner's fields from a nested aggregation.
So it is not possible to do following:
  * Bucket aggregations on them (a very common use case) as a sub aggregation of the nested one. For example If multiple lawyers are assigned to cases of different types and each assignment captures his/her hours spent and report needs to be total hours by lawyer by case type. It is impossible to do so. Using reverse_nested and back will not produce desired results
  * Filter on owner's fields within aggregations.
  * Metrics aggregations on owner's fields are a little less useful as there will be double-counting but often are necessary as well
