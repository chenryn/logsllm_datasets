User: I just downloaded Python sources, unpacked them to /usr/local/src/Python-3.5.1/, run ./configure and make there. Now, according to documentation, I should run make install.
But I don't want to install it somewhere in common system folders, create any links, change or add environment variables, doing anything outside this folder. In other words, I want it to be portable. How do I do it? Will /usr/local/src/Python-3.5.1/python get-pip.py install Pip to /usr/local/src/Python-3.5.1/Lib/site-packages/? Will /usr/local/src/Python-3.5.1/python work properly?
make altinstall, as I understand, still creates links what is not desired. Is it correct that it creates symbolic links as well but simply doesn't touch /usr/bin/python and man?
Probably, I should do ./configure prefix=some/private/path and just make and make install but I still wonder if it's possible to use Python make install.
Assistant: If you don't want to copy the binaries you built into a shared location for system-wide use, you should not make install at all. If the build was successful, it will have produced binaries you can run. You may need to set up an environment for making them use local run-time files instead of the system-wide ones, but this is a common enough requirement for developers that it will often be documented in a README or similar (though as always when dealing with development sources, be prepared that it might not be as meticulously kept up to date as end-user documentation in a released version).
