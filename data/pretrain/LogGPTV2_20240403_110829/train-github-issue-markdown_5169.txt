## Expected Behavior
In page component lifecycle method, it could access `req` and `res` in server
side.
## Current Behavior
In static method `getInitialProps`, the argument `context` has fields `req`
and `res` which is express request & response. However, there is no way to
access `req` and `res` in page component lifecycle methods, because life cycle
methods are instance methods.
## Context
In some cases, it is preferred to have access to `req` and `res` in component
lifecycle methods in server side. I tried to have `getInitialProps` to return
`req` & `res` as props, but `next.js` throw warnings about that these objects
are not OK to be dehydrated.
For the time being, I used request-local-storage to transfer access from
`getIntialProps` method. I hope `next.js` could have some native support for
this scenario.
