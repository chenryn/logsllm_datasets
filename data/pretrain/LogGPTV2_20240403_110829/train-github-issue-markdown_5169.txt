### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
In the page component's lifecycle methods, it should be possible to access `req` and `res` on the server side.

#### Current Behavior
In the static method `getInitialProps`, the `context` argument contains `req` and `res`, which are Express request and response objects. However, there is no way to access `req` and `res` within the page component's lifecycle methods, as these methods are instance methods.

#### Context
In certain scenarios, it is desirable to have access to `req` and `res` in the component's lifecycle methods on the server side. I attempted to return `req` and `res` as props from `getInitialProps`, but `next.js` throws warnings about these objects not being suitable for dehydration.

As a workaround, I am currently using `request-local-storage` to transfer access from the `getInitialProps` method. I hope that `next.js` could provide native support for this use case.
