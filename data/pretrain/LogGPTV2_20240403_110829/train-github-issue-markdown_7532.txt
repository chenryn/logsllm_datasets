Today, you have two ways to define a list of synonyms:
  * within the index settings (mapping) which could cause a very big index metadata (so big cluster state - imagine daily indices)
  * on the file system itself but this is hard to maintain then
This feature request is about storing that document within an index and be
able to retrieve it when the index is created/loaded.
