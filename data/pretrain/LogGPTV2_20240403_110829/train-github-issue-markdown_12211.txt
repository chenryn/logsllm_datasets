Subject: Issue with Scroll Bars on Apache Superset Website

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to report an issue I encountered while using the Apache Superset website (https://superset.apache.org/). Specifically, on several pages, there are scroll bars appearing on the right side. However, I am unable to use these scroll bars to view the full content of the text, as it does not scroll down as expected.

Could you please look into this and address the problem at your earliest convenience? 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
