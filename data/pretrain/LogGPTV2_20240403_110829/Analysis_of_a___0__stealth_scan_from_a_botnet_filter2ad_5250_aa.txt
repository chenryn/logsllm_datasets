## Abstract
Botnets are the primary vehicle for cyber-criminal activities, including spamming, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, brute-force cracking, and stealing private information. They often conduct network scans to identify vulnerable machines, enumerate networks, or penetrate systems. This paper presents the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. The 12-day scan involved approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and employed a highly coordinated and covert scanning strategy to target VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and correlated this data with other public sources to validate our findings. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified, and its behavior represents significant advancements in modern malware, using sophisticated stealth scanning strategies to target critical voice communications infrastructure. This work provides a detailed dissection of the botnet's scanning behavior, including methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet activity across the global Internet.

## Introduction
Botnets are collections of Internet hosts ("bots") that have been infected with malware and are under the control of a single entity ("botmaster"). These botnets can consist of up to a few million hosts. Unaware users continue their legitimate activities while their infected PCs execute various malicious activities in the background, such as spamming, phishing, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-force password cracking, and stealing credentials. The news media and scientific literature have documented numerous criminal activities carried out by botnets over the past few years, including on mobile devices.

Botnets perform network scanning for various reasons, including propagation, enumeration, and penetration. One common type of scanning, called "horizontal scanning," systematically probes the same protocol port across a range of IP addresses. For example, the Conficker botnet uses a horizontal scan to exploit known system vulnerabilities and recruit new bots. In this study, we focus on a different type of botnet scan—one that is explicitly commanded and controlled by the botmaster and occurs over a well-defined interval.

Several botnets have been analyzed in the literature, with studies characterizing botnet scanning techniques based on packet captures from darknets and honeynets or by examining botnet source code. Documented scans by botnets have typically involved relatively small numbers of bots (e.g., around 3,000) and were lightly coordinated, with many bots randomly probing the same target address range.

In February 2011, the UCSD /8 Network Telescope captured traffic reflecting a previously undocumented large-scale stealth scanning behavior from a botnet using about 3 million unique source IP addresses. We identified the malware responsible for this massive and sophisticated scanning activity as a binary module of the Sality botnet, which targets SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) servers. We refer to this scanning event as "sipscan" throughout the rest of the paper.

Our contributions include techniques to characterize a large-scale, intentionally surreptitious scan of the entire IPv4 space (a " /0" scan), confirming that the scan was not using spoofed source IP addresses but was being sourced by a large botnet. We correlated darknet traffic with two other publicly available sources of Internet traffic data, suggesting that the scan covered the entire IPv4 address space. We also created animations and visualizations to understand the strictly ordered progression of the scan, delineating different phases and its adaptation to changing network conditions. These methods and tools have provided substantial insights into the first observed /0 scan by a botnet and have broad applicability to other analyses of unidirectional or bidirectional traffic.

## Background and Related Work
Botnets have been an active area of research for almost a decade, starting with early-generation botnets that used IRC channels for centralized Command & Control (C&C) infrastructures. In 2007, the Storm botnet introduced a new generation of botnet capabilities, including the use of peer-to-peer protocols for distributed C&C. These botnets are harder to detect and dismantle due to their lack of a single point of failure and their use of sophisticated techniques like encrypted communication and Fast Flux DNS resolution.

Researchers have studied methods for automated discovery of botnets, formal models of botnet communication, and their use in orchestrated spam campaigns. Botnets commonly scan large segments of the Internet address space to find hosts to infect or for network mapping and service discovery. Analyzing these events can improve our understanding of evolving botnet characteristics and spreading techniques, our ability to distinguish them from benign traffic sources, and our ability to mitigate attacks. However, the analysis of botnet scanning activities has received little attention in the literature.

In 2005, Yegneswaran, Barford, and Paxson analyzed six months of network traffic captured by honeynets, classifying 22 large-scale events into three categories: worm outbreaks, misconfigurations, and botnet probings. These first-generation botnets were smaller, less evolved, and used centralized IRC-based command and control. Li, Goyal, and Chen analyzed traffic data from 10 contiguous /24 networks operating as honeynets in 2006, inferring properties of the botnet, such as geographical location and operating system. Their comprehensive analysis of data from 2006 and 2007, corroborated by data from the DShield project and botnet source code, identified 203 botnet scans, all targeting at most a /8 network with inferred bot populations significantly smaller than the February 2011 scan (3 million IP addresses). These first-generation botnets employed simple scanning strategies with high redundancy and overlap.

The scan we observe and analyze differs from previous work in several ways: (i) it is recent (2011) and related to a new-generation, widely-deployed, peer-to-peer botnet (Sality); (ii) it is observed from a larger darknet (a /8 network); (iii) the population of bots participating in the scan is several orders of magnitude larger; (iv) the target scope is the entire IPv4 address space; (v) it adopts a well-orchestrated stealth scan strategy with little redundancy and overlap.

This last point is the most surprising finding. The remarkably stealthy scanning employed by new-generation botnets suggests that many large-scale scans may have occurred in recent years but gone unnoticed. Despite the lack of literature documenting highly coordinated large-scale network scans from botnets, the concept has been discussed in theoretical analyses of attack potential and for Internet-wide service discovery. For service discovery, a scan strategy based on reverse-byte sequential increments of target IP addresses, named "Reverse IP Sequential (RIS)," was considered but dismissed for being difficult to extrapolate metrics from partial scans. We discovered that this was exactly the technique used by the Internet-wide scan ("sipscan") we study in this paper.

Another novel aspect of the scan is that it targets SIP infrastructure, which is not typically probed by botnets. Only in the past two years have SIP servers been reported as the object of large-scale attacks. As more voice communications move to an IP substrate, fraudulent activity targeting SIP-based VoIP services offers an attractive source of revenue for cybercrime. In April 2010, Sheldon reported a series of brute-force password-guessing attacks on SIP servers worldwide, sourced from the Amazon EC2 cloud. Later in 2010, several sources reported on a new malware named "sundayaddr," which behaved like a few-hundred node botnet trying to brute-force accounts on SIP servers. The layout of the SIP headers in the attacking packets was almost identical to that of SIPVicious, a tool suite designed to perform security auditing of SIP services. It seems likely that the attack code was a slightly modified version of SIPVicious. In November 2010, the author of SIPVicious reported another large-scale attack against several SIP servers worldwide, using a significantly different SIP header. These events were widely discussed on public SIP operational mailing lists.

In contrast, the scan we document in this study was not publicly reported with respect to either observed network traffic or server activity. Symantec identified and analyzed the binary responsible for what we call the "sipscan," which they discovered while monitoring Sality, a large peer-to-peer based botnet. A host infected by Sality downloads the scanning binary via a component of the main bot executable, which is responsible for downloading and executing additional malware whose URLs are communicated by other botnet peers. During our analysis, we had access to the same binary code and verified that it matches the SIP headers we observed in the sipscan. Symantec did not publish any information about the stealth scanning strategy or the reverse byte order adopted by the sipscan. Our study, based on network traffic measurement and analysis, is complementary to what has been found by reverse-engineering the code running on the bots, showing novel insights into the botnet population and the orchestration and coordination of the scan. Since Sality is one of the largest known botnets but relatively undocumented in research literature, our study sheds light on the scanning behavior of this new-generation botnet.

## Analysis Part I: Anatomy of the Sipscan

### Overview
The sipscan probes each target IP address with two packets: (i) a UDP packet to port 5060 carrying a SIP header and (ii) a TCP SYN packet attempting to open a connection on port 80. We observe the sipscan at a darknet, where there are no devices responding to incoming traffic, so we do not observe any further packets for the same flows except for TCP SYN retransmits.

Figure 1 depicts the SIP header of the packets sent by the sipscan. This SIP header is a request to register a random user account on a SIP server, but random account registrations are usually not indicative of legitimate activity.
