ABSTRACT
Botnets are the most common vehicle of cyber-criminal activity.
They are used for spamming, phishing, denial of service attacks,
brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber war-
fare. Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, includ-
ing searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into
the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc.
We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of
the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in
February of last year. This 12-day scan originated from approxi-
mately 3 million distinct IP addresses, and used a heavily coordi-
nated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and
compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed
this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet con-
tinuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited trafﬁc, and we cor-
relate this trafﬁc data with other public sources of data to validate
our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identiﬁed by
researchers, its behavior represents ominous advances in the evo-
lution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth
scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting crit-
ical voice communications infrastructure. This work offers a de-
tailed dissection of the botnet’s scanning behavior, including gen-
eral methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior
across the global Internet.

INTRODUCTION
Botnets are collections of Internet hosts (“bots”) that through
malware infection have fallen under the control of a single entity
(“botmaster”). Botnets of up to few million hosts have been ob-
served [4, 23, 54]. Innocent users carry on with their legitimate
activities, unaware that their infected PCs are executing various
types of malicious activity in the background, including spamming,
phishing, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, brute-force password
cracking, stealing of credentials, espionage and cyber warfare. The
news media and scientiﬁc literature have documented many crimi-
nal activities carried out by botnets over the last few years [15, 20,
35, 59], including on mobile phones [42].
Botnets perform network scanning for different reasons: propa-
gation, enumeration, penetration. One common type of scanning,
called “horizontal scanning”, systematically probes the same pro-
tocol port across a given range of IP addresses, sometimes select-
ing random IP addresses as targets. To infect new hosts in order
to recruit them as bots, some botnets, e.g., Conﬁcker [27, 46], per-
form a horizontal scan continuously using self-propagating worm
code that exploits a known system vulnerability. In this work we
focus on a different type of botnet scan – one performed under the
explicit command and control of the botmaster, occurring over a
well-delimited interval.
Several botnets have been analyzed in the literature, including
characterizing botnet scanning techniques either based on packet
captures from darknets and honeynets [38, 39], or by examining
botnet source code [11]. Documented scans by botnets have been
of relatively small size (e.g. around 3000 bots) [39] and lightly
coordinated, e.g., many bots randomly (typically uniformly ran-
domly [39]) probing the same target address range.
In February 2011, the UCSD /8 Network Telescope instrumenta-
tion [7] captured trafﬁc reﬂecting a previously undocumented large-
scale stealth scanning behavior (across the entire IPv4 space, we
believe) from a botnet using about 3 million unique source IP ad-
dresses. We identiﬁed the malware responsible for this massive and
sophisticated scanning activity as a binary module of the Sality
botnet [23] known to target SIP (Session Initiation Protocol [49])
servers [22]. We hence refer to this interesting scanning event as
“sipscan” throughout the rest of this paper.
Our contributions in this study include techniques to character-
ize a large-scale intentionally surreptitious scan of the entire IPv4
space (that is, a “/0” scan), including use of additional data to con-
ﬁrm that the scan was not using spoofed source IP addresses, but
rather was being sourced by a large botnet. We correlated darknet
trafﬁc over this period with two other publicly available sources
of Internet trafﬁc data that strongly suggest the scan was not just
of this /8 but over the entire IPv4 Internet address space. Finally,
we created animations and visualization to help us understand the
1strictly ordered progression of the entire /0 scan, and correlate its
address space and geographic coverage with its trafﬁc volume. These
tools also enabled us to delineate different phases of its scanning
activity and its adaptation to changing network conditions. These
methods and tools have already yielded substantial insight into the
ﬁrst observed /0 scan by a botnet, but we anticipate a wide range
of applicability to other analyses of unidirectional or even bidirec-
tional trafﬁc.
Section 2 summarizes related work. Sections 3 describes the anat-
omy of the scan, including high-level characteristics and validation
that it was indeed carried out by a botnet targeting the entire IPv4
space. Section 4 analyzes more detailed properties of the scan, in-
cluding the impressively covert scanning strategy, bot turnover rate,
coverage and overlap in target addresses, and highly orchestrated
adaptivity and coordination of the bots. Section 6 summarizes our
ﬁndings and contributions.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Botnets have been an active area of research for almost a decade,
starting with early generation botnets that used IRC channels to
implement centralized Command & Control (C&C) infrastructures
[9, 17]. In 2007 the Storm botnet signaled a new generation of
botnet capabilities, including the use of peer-to-peer protocols to
support distributed C&C channels [33, 51, 58]. These botnets are
harder to detect and dismantle because there is no single point of
failure, and they often use sophisticated techniques such as en-
crypted communication [58] and Fast ﬂux DNS resolution [14].
Researchers have also studied methods for automated discovery
of botnets [31, 40, 56], formal models of botnet communication
[16, 18], and their use for orchestrated spam campaigns [36, 45].
Botnets commonly scan large segments of Internet address space,
either seeking hosts to infect or compromise, or for the purpose
of network mapping and service discovery. Analyzing and detect-
ing these events can improve our understanding of evolving botnet
characteristics and spreading techniques, our ability to distinguish
them from benign trafﬁc sources, and our ability to mitigate attacks.
But analysis of network probing activities of botnets has received
little attention in the literature.
In 2005, Yegneswaran, Barford, and Paxson analyzed six months
of network trafﬁc captured by honeynets [62]. Based on statisti-
cal properties of trafﬁc, they characterized and classiﬁed 22 large-
scale events into three categories: worm outbreaks, misconﬁgura-
tions, and botnet probings. These ﬁrst-generation botnets were less
evolved in several ways than those we see today: in size (a maxi-
mum of 26,000 bots), scope (largest target scope was a /8 network),
and communication capabilities (centralized IRC-based command
and control). Li, Goyal, and Chen [38] analyzed trafﬁc data they
collected from 10 contiguous /24 networks operating as honeynets
throughout 2006. Through analysis of the probing trafﬁc they were
able to infer properties of the botnet, e.g., geographical location of,
and operating system running on infected machines. We use a sim-
ilar approach to infer characteristics of the botnet scan we study in
this paper. These three authors collaborated with Paxson on a more
comprehensive analysis of data from both 2006 and 2007, which
was corroborated both by data from the DShield project [34] and
by the inspection of botnet source code [39]. Analyzing the traf-
ﬁc from 10 contiguous /24 darknets/honeynets they identiﬁed 203
botnet scans with different characteristics, all scanning at most a /8
network, and all with inferred bot populations signiﬁcantly smaller
(200-3700) than the February 2011 scan captured at our darknet (3
million IP addresses), They found that these ﬁrst-generation bot-
nets employed simple scanning strategies, either sequential or uni-
form random scanning, and elementary orchestration capabilities:
many bots scanning the same address range independently, with
high redundancy and large overlap in target addresses. Other stud-
ies have found similar results via examination of botnet source code
to understand the scanning strategies [10, 11]. Barford and Yeg-
neswaran [11] inspected four widely-used IRC botnet code bases,
ﬁnding only primitive scanning capabilities with “no means for ef-
ﬁcient distribution of a target address space among a collection of
bots”. However these studies did not analyze any new-generation
botnets.
The scan that we observe and analyze in this study differs from
previous work in several ways: (i) it is recent (2011) and related
to a new-generation, widely-deployed, peer-to-peer botnet (Sality
[23]); (ii) it is observed from a larger darknet (a /8 network); (iii)
the population of bots participating in the scan is several orders of
magnitude larger; (iv) the target scope is the entire IPv4 address
space; (v) it adopts a well-orchestrated stealth scan strategy with
little redundancy and overlap.
This last point is the most surprising ﬁnding in terms of novelty
and impact. The remarkably stealth scanning employed by new-
generation botnets gives us reason to suspect that many large-scale
scans may have occurred in recent years but gone unnoticed by
any modern instrumentation for studying it. Despite the lack of any
literature documenting the observation of highly coordinated large-
scale network scans from botnets, the concept has been discussed,
both in a worst-case theoretical analysis of attack potential [57],
and for the more benign application of Internet-wide service dis-
covery [37]. For service discovery, these authors considered a scan
strategy based on reverse-byte sequential increments of target IP
addresses, which they named “Reverse IP Sequential (RIS)”. Al-
though they dismissed this option for being difﬁcult to extrapolate
metrics from partial scans, we discovered that this was exactly the
technique used by the Internet-wide scan (“sipscan”) we study in
this paper (Section 4.1). Heidemann’s et al. reachability census was
Internet-wide but ran independently from two hosts, not coordi-
nated in the way botnets are [32].
Another relatively novel aspect of the scan we analyze is that it
targets SIP infrastructure, which is not typically in published lists of
services probed by botnets [39]. Only in the past 2 years have SIP
servers been reported as the object of large-scale attacks [47,52,64].
As more of the world’s voice communications move to an IP sub-
strate, fraudulent activity targeting SIP-based VoIP services offers
an attractive source of revenue to cybercrime [24]. In April 2010,
Sheldon reported a series of brute-force password-guessing attacks
on SIP servers worldwide, sourced from the Amazon EC2 cloud
[52, 64]. Later in 2010, several sources reported on a new malware
named “sundayaddr”, which behaved like a few-hundred node bot-
net comprised of unix-like machines (e.g., Linux, FreeBSD) trying
to brute-force accounts on SIP servers [30, 47]. The layout of the
SIP headers in the attacking packets was almost identical to that
of SIPVicious, a tool suite written in Python designed to perform
security auditing of SIP services [26]. It seems therefore likely that
the attack code was a slightly modiﬁed version of SIPVicious [47].
In November 2010, the author of SIPVicious reported another
large-scale attack against several SIP servers worldwide, using a
more signiﬁcantly different SIP header than used by SIPVicious
[25, 53]. Both of these events were reported by several parties and
were largely discussed on public SIP operational mailing lists [6,8].
In contrast, to the best of our knowledge the scan that we docu-
ment in this study was not publicly reported with respect to either
observed network trafﬁc or server activity (e.g. logs). Symantec
identiﬁed and analyzed the binary responsible for what we call the
“sipscan”, which they discovered while monitoring Sality, a large
peer-to-peer based botnet [22, 23]. A host infected by Sality down-
2loads the scanning binary via a component of the main bot exe-
cutable, which is responsible for downloading and executing ad-
ditional malware whose URLs are communicated by other botnet
peers [23]. During our analysis we had access to the same binary
code and veriﬁed that it matches the SIP headers we observed in
the sipscan. Symantec did not publish any information about the
stealth scanning strategy or in particular on the reverse byte or-
der adopted by the sipscan (Section 4.1). Our study, based instead
on network trafﬁc measurement and analysis, is complementary to
what has been found by reverse-engineering the code running on
the bots, showing novel insights into the botnet population and the
orchestration and coordination of the scan. Since Sality is one of
the largest known botnets but relatively undocumented in research
literature, another contribution of our study is to shed light on the
scanning behavior of this new-generation botnet.
3. ANALYSIS PART I: ANATOMY OF THE
SIPSCAN
3.1 Overview
The sipscan probes each target IP address with two packets: (i) a
UDP packet to port 5060 carrying a SIP header and (ii) a TCP SYN
packet attempting to open a connection on port 80. We observe the
sipscan at a darknet – i.e., there are no devices on it responding to
incoming trafﬁc – so we do not observe any further packets for the
same ﬂows except for TCP SYN retransmits.
Figure 1 depicts the SIP header of the packets sent by the sip-
scan. This SIP header is a request to register a random user account
on a SIP server, but random account registrations are usually not
