# CVE-2021-36873
## Description
The WordPress iQ Block Country plugin (versions up to and including the latest release at the time of writing) is vulnerable to an Authenticated Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. This vulnerability allows authenticated users with specific permissions to inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then executed in the browser of other users who view the affected content.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the WordPress admin panel with a user account that has the necessary permissions.
2. Navigate to the iQ Block Country settings page.
3. Locate a form or input field where you can enter custom data.
4. Inject a malicious script into the input field. For example:
   ```html
   <script>alert('XSS');</script>
   ```
5. Scroll down and press the `Save Changes` button to save the injected script.
6. The malicious script will now be stored and executed whenever another user visits the affected page.
