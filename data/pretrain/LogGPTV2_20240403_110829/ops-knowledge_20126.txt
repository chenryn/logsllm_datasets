When attempting to upload my application to Google App Engine, I encountered the following error message from `appcfg`:

```
This application does not exist (app_id=u'xxx').
```

Initially, I was only a developer on the existing App Engine project. To test, I created a new App Engine project where I was the owner. However, I still received the same error message even with the newly created App Engine.

I resolved the issue by modifying the `app.yaml` file to specify the correct `application` ID. Here is the updated command that worked for me:

1. Modified the `app.yaml` file to include the correct `application` ID:
   ```yaml
   application: some_id
   ```

2. Ran the `appcfg.py` update command:
   ```sh
   python appcfg.py update ../some_application/server/python
   ```

By ensuring the `application` ID in the `app.yaml` file matched the ID of the new App Engine project, I was able to successfully upload the application.
