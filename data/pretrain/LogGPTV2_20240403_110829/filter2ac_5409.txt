**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Execution Prevention

To mitigate the potential misuse of `msbuild.exe` by adversaries, it is recommended to implement application control measures that block its execution if it is not necessary for the system or network. For instance, in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and later versions, you can use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to create policy rules that prevent the execution of `msbuild.exe`. This approach helps to safeguard against unauthorized use of the application. [7]
