# Troubleshooting Persistent Volumes
This chapter is about storage troubleshooting, including PV, PVC, LocalVolume and StorageClass.
Usually, getting the status and events of PV/PVC is our first step, e.g.
```sh
kubectl get pv
kubectl get pvc
kubectl get sc
kubectl describe pv 
kubectl describe pvc 
kubectl describe sc 
```
