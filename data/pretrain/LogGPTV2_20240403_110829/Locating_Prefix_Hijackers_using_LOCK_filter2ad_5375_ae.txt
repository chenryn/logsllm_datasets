Figure 5: Correlating the impact with the ranking value
• More than 80% of the time, our basic algorithm pin-
points the hijacker by ranking it as top 1 on the sus-
pect list, regardless what kind of attack and with
how many monitors, as long as more than the mini-
mum number of 10 monitors.
• Because of the early convergence problem de-
scribed in Section 5.2,
the hijacker may not be
ranked the ﬁrst. Therefore as we look into not only
the highest ranked node but even more nodes, the
chance that the hijacker is included in this selective
set increases. For example with 10 monitors, the
chance that an imposture hijacker is found among
the top three nodes is more than 94%, a 14% in-
crease from only looking at the highest ranked sus-
pect.
• The hijacker-locating algorithm performs best in
imposture scenarios. The reason is that imposture
paths are more likely to be straight without detour-
ing.
• Obviously the more monitors we employ, the bet-
ter the algorithm works. What is interesting is that
seemingly by having m = 30 we have reached
the point of diminishing return: having more than
30 monitors no longer improves the performance
much.
Next, we study the relationship between the impact of
a hijack event and where the hijacker is ranked in the sus-
pect list. This shows another aspect of the quality of our
hijacker-locating algorithm. That is, not only we want to
locate hijackers, we especially want to locate the hijack-
ers causing great damages. Figure 5 shows the ranking
(x-axis) vs the median impact of all hijackers with the
same ranking (Y-axis). All three plots in Figure 5 show
that there is a positive relationship between the hijacker’s
rank and the impact of its hijack attack. In other words,
the larger the impact caused by a hijacker, the more likely
our locating algorithm will rank the hijacker high in the
suspect list. This is mostly due to the fact that the early
converge problems occur mostly at where hijacks have
small impacts, near Internet edge.
6.3.3 Effectiveness of Improvements
Finally, we evaluate the quality of two improvements (I1
and I2) proposed in Section 5.3. In particular, we are not
only interested in the increase in top-1 accuracy these
improvements may bring, but also the false negative rate
(FNR), which is the ratio that the improvements mistak-
enly exclude a hijacker from the suspect list.
Table 1 shows both sets of numbers for different kinds
of attacks and different number of monitors. Different
combinations of the basic algorithm and the improve-
ments are shown in different rows of the table.
• I2 helps more. The reason is that for I1 we can only
trust the path before converges. But for I2, we have
more information provided by the reference point
traceroute.
• When combining I1 and I2, the accuracy can be fur-
ther improved. This is because the nodes that I1 and
I2 remove from the suspect list are typically not the
same.
• In general, LOCK (i.e., B+I1+I2) is able to pin-
point the preﬁx hijacker AS with an accuracy of
over 91%, up to 94.3%.
• The false negative ratio introduced by improve-
ments is relatively low. For example, when using
all monitors we can improve the accuracy by more
than 5% by applying both I1 and I2, while the false
negative ratio resulted from applying the improve-
ments is only 0.09%
6.3.4 Effectiveness on different AS-levels
We study the locating accuracy when the hijacker located
in different level in the AS hierarchy. We classify AS
nodes into three tiers: Tier-1 nodes, transit nodes, and

stub nodes like in [23]. 4 Our hijackers in planetlab be-
longs to transit nodes, or stub nodes. When using two
improvements and 30 monitors, we compare the accu-
racy and false negative ration for these two classes, in
Table 2. The hijackers on the higher level could be lo-
cated more easily. The hijackers on the edge is relatively
hard to locate. We can still achieve more than 90% accu-
racy.
6.3.5 Effectiveness of ﬁltering after locating the hi-
jacker
After locating the AS, the next step is to ﬁlter the fake
AS announcement from it. We compare the average per-
centage of impacted (polluted) AS, before and after the
locating and ﬁltering either stop on the origin or on the
Tier1 AS. As a comparison, we also select the last hop
of AS of the observed paths as a hijacker (simple locat-
ing approach) then do the same ﬁltering. They are under
malicious case. Table 3 shows that Lock is more helpful
than simple locating method to prevent hijacks.
6.3.6 Remarks
We have shown that LOCK performs well using monitor-
to-preﬁx paths measured in the data plane. Similar ob-
servation would hold if control plane paths are used in
LOCK. In the non-malicious cases, the monitor-to-preﬁx
paths that observed in the control plane are the same as
those observed in the data plane. However, in the mali-
cious case, we have shown that the hijacker can employ
more sophisticated evasion technique in the data plane
than in the control plane. Therefore, our results shown
