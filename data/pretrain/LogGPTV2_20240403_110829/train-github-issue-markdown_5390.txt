**Current behavior**  
If we use `providers` on the module, service become application level. So, it
is way to provide application-level services (as it made in example).
But, if we create lazy-loaded module it can import another modules, and import
its providers as well. Due to lazy loaded modules get their own root scope,
imported providers will override application root providers, and dublicate
instances of the services will be created.
So, if we using lazy-loaded modules, we should not use feature module
providers at all - these services will be dublicated. We only can use
providers of the AppModule. There is no use case, where feature module
providers can be safely used.
Additional info and documentation refs there.
**Expected behavior**
Something should be fixed in the architecture, to create use case for feature
module providers, or this feature should be deprecated. Documentation should
describe, how to define application-level providers (in AppModule, and not in
feature modules).
