# No MAS: Misadventures in High Security Lock Design
## Mike Davis

### Introduction
- **Professional Background**: I work at IOActive, where I focus on hacking various embedded systems.
- **Hobbies and Interests**:
  - Amateur lock picker (though I'm not very skilled).
  - I have a good understanding of how "pixies" (a metaphor for the underlying principles) flow.
  - My goal is to hack as many things as possible, not just one.

### Today's Plan
- We will try to think like a lock vendor.
- We'll briefly explore the evolution of high-security lock design and the pervasive flaws that these design requirements and decisions often lead to.
- We'll examine how the same flaw manifests repeatedly.
- We'll discuss responsible disclosure.

### Design Requirements
- **Lock**: Electronic with an audit trail.
- **Power Solution**: Long-lasting, as replacing batteries is not feasible.
- **Permissions System**: Not solely based on physical key possession.
- **Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for traditional mechanisms, considering physical constraints.
- **Security**: More secure than traditional mechanical designs, leveraging electronic components.

### Lock Design
- **Overview**: A look at the general design principles.
- **Security Considerations**: How security features are integrated into the design.

### Cyberlock
- **Vulnerability**: The CyberLock, powered through its communication port, may be susceptible to Side-Channel Power Analysis (SPA) attacks. The lock leaks a significant power side-channel to any potential "key" as the processor clocks the key across an I2C bus.
- **Observation**: This approach seems excessive given the existing issues.
- **Reference**: [IOActive Cyberlock Advisory]

### Lessons Learned
- **Advantages**:
  - Drop-in replacements for classical designs.
  - No need for batteries.
  - Audit trails and permission systems.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Inadequate cryptography.
  - Reliance on external power.
  - Unfixable vulnerabilities.

### A Quick Tangent
- Additional insights or related topics.

### Yet Another Design
- **Advantages**:
  - Cost-effective.
  - Battery failure does not render the safe unusable.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Still reliant on external power.
  - Introduction of secondary side-channels (e.g., beeping sounds).

### Another Quick Tangent
- Further related topics or examples.

### ATM Security
- **Quote**: "Here’s where the money is stored in an ATM. In the past, criminals tried to break into this, but now they are more sophisticated." – [Source: Guy I owe a beer to]

### Questions?
- Open floor for questions and discussions.

### No MAS: AuditCon Gen2 S2000
- **Encryption**:
  - Combinations, such as those for ATMs, banks, and master keys, are typically stored in encrypted form.
  - The encryption method involves distributing bits of the combination in various memory locations and filling unoccupied locations with random bits.
  - Decryption involves removing the random bits and reassembling the remaining bits.
  - Other encryption/decryption schemes can be used if desired.
- **Patent Reference**: US5488660A

### What Exactly is Encrypted?
- **Observation**: There is no actual cryptography; there is simply no room for it.
- **Behavior**: The locks load their personality on every boot before accepting combinations.
- **Uniformity**: Each lock is identical except for its EEPROM contents.
- **Variation**: Different types of locks operate slightly differently.

### Soft I2C and Hardware I2C
- **Soft I2C**: Exploring the software implementation.
- **Hardware I2C**: Examining the hardware response.

### Demonstration
- **Pop!**: A live demonstration of the vulnerability.
- **Demo**: Practical showcase of the issue.

### Gen2
- **AuditCon**: Discussion on the Gen2 model.
- **Question**: "But what about Gen2?"
- **Note**: *Gen2 is… interesting.*

### Responsible Disclosure
- **Steps**:
  - Write an advisory.
  - Perform responsible disclosure.
  - Present findings at DEFCON.

### Fuuuuuu.
- **Mistaken Identity**: Sometimes Kaba (a lock manufacturer) is not the same Kaba.
  - We contacted the wrong Kaba, but they also make locks.
  - Their locks share a similar design pattern.
  - **Quote**: "I believe that you will find that the X-09 design different enough to be much more of a challenge. If you are experimenting on an X-10 lock, you have obtained the lock illegally, and whoever from the U.S. provided/sold you the lock will be pursued by U.S. Federal agents."

### Redundant Design
- **Importance**: Why redundant design matters in high-security lock design.

### X-08 and X-09
- **Models**: Discussion on the X-08 and X-09 models.

### Questions?
- **Contact Information**: PI:EMAIL
- **Time for Questions**: Did I even leave time for questions?
