User: since it is not possible to access mysql remotely on GAE, without the google cloud sql, 
could I put a sqlite3 file on google cloud storage and access it through the GAE with django.db.backends.sqlite3?
Thanks.
Assistant: No. SQLite requires native code libraries that aren't available on App Engine.
