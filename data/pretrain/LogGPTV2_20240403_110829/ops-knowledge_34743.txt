Assistant: Two invalid users, cyrus and FILTER, attempted to access the system from IP addresses 187.141.143.180 and 104.192.3.34 respectively. Both attempts failed. A valid user, fztu, successfully logged in from IP address 119.137.62.142. Another invalid user, matlab, attempted to access the system from IP address 52.80.34.196 but was unsuccessful.
