User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 poor_aggregation_performance 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This code diagnoses poor aggregation performance in SQL queries. It identifies four potential root causes: (1) when the GUC parameter 'enable_hashagg' is set to 'off', resulting in a higher tendency to use the GroupAgg operator; (2) when the query includes scenarios like 'count(distinct col)', which makes HashAgg unavailable; (3) when the cost of the GroupAgg operator is expensive; and (4) when the cost of the HashAgg operator is expensive. The code checks for these conditions and provides detailed information and suggestions for each potential root cause. If none of these conditions are met, poor aggregation performance is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- total_cost
- cost_rate_threshold
- enable_hashagg
- GroupAggregate
- HashAggregate
- Group By Key
- NDV
