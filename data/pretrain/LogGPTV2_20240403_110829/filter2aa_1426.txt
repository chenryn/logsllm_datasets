In today's world, the line between industrial and government espionage is increasingly blurred. The methods of hacking and information theft have evolved from clever exploitation of technology to more straightforward and often illegal means. This shift has turned computer crime into a lucrative business.

### Key Points
- **Espionage Evolution**: From hacking for exploration to stealing money and information.
- **Financial Motives**: The rise of stolen credit card numbers, botnet attacks, and identity theft.
- **Adaptability**: Attackers use both digital and physical methods to achieve their goals.

## Elicitation Techniques
Elicitation involves the subtle extraction of information during seemingly normal and innocent conversations. Here are some effective techniques:

- **Avoid Direct Questions**: Never ask the obvious question.
- **Play Dumb**: Make deliberately false statements to encourage corrections.
- **One-Upmanship**: Engage in a game of one-upmanship to gather information.
- **Ask for Help**: People are often willing to assist.
- **Flattery**: Use praise to gain favor.
- **Mid-Conversation Sensitive Questions**: Ask sensitive questions mid-conversation.
- **Memory Tricks**: People remember the beginning and end of conversations; use this to your advantage.
- **Piecing Together Information**: Gather small pieces of information from various sources within and outside the company.

### Statistics on Elicitation
- 50% of people will talk to an anonymous stranger immediately.
- 35% will ask who the stranger is working for but will still talk after being told they can't say.
- 15% won't talk at all.

## Recruitment of Spies
Recruitment involves a gradual process of entrapment through subtle compromises. Here are the steps:

1. **Spot the Potential Recruit**
2. **Do Your Homework**
3. **Get Access to Them**
4. **Develop Them as a Recruit**
5. **Recruit Them**
6. **Profit**

### Factors to Consider
- **Access to Information and People**
- **Motivations and Vices**
- **Background Work**: Research potential motivations such as money, revenge, blackmail, national pride, emotional involvement, naivete, sex, and ideology.

### Access Agents
- **Find Recruits**: Identify potential agents.
- **Make Introductions**: Facilitate connections.
- **Trust Through Intimacy**: People trust those with whom they have intimate relationships.

## Infiltration Techniques
If you can't spot a likely agent, infiltration is another option. Here are some methods:

- **Tailgating**: Follow legitimate users through secure doors.
- **Forged IDs**: Create fake identification.
- **Request to Exit Sensors**: Exploit motion detectors.
- **Mechanism Attacks**: Bypass security mechanisms.
- **Dropped Ceilings**: Use hidden spaces for access.

### Case Study: Military Base Security Test
A security officer at a military base tested his facility's security by giving two staff members ID cards with African baboon photos. They went undetected for three months, highlighting the ineffectiveness of photo IDs.

## Lockset Vulnerabilities
Many locks can be bypassed without picking them. Common vulnerabilities include:

- **Sliding/Carding/Loiding**: Using a credit card to push back the latch.
- **Deadlatch Issues**: Some modern locks are vulnerable if not properly installed.
- **Electronic Locks**: Bypassing keypads with highlighter ink or breath condensation.

### Case Study: Watergate Burglars
The Watergate burglars were caught because they used duct tape to keep doors unlocked, which was noticed by a security guard. This highlights the importance of attention to detail in security.

## Visual Surveillance
Visual surveillance is a legal and effective method. Modern optics and vantage points can reveal a lot. For example, researchers used publicly accessible areas to observe the operations of Boston’s MBTA subway system.

## Audio Surveillance
Audio surveillance can be achieved through various means, including:

- **Software Bugs**: Tools like Flexispy can turn phones into listening devices.
- **Hidden Devices**: Concealed intercoms and voice recorders.
- **Voice Mail**: Easy to password-guess.
- **Wireless Microphones and Bluetooth**: Provide clear audio over a distance.
- **TEMPEST**: Using electronic emissions to reconstruct data.
- **Phone Taps**: Intercepting phone calls.
- **Transmitters**: Hidden in various locations, even outside the room.
- **Thermal Imaging**: Detecting heat signatures.

### Case Studies
- **Ritz-Carlton Hotel**: A hidden babyphone was found in a high-profile guest's room.
- **Equitable Life CEO and Tommy Sheridan**: Examples of successful surveillance operations.

## Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM)
Effective TSCM involves using spectrum analyzers and other tools to detect and neutralize bugs. However, many off-the-shelf bug finders are ineffective. Professional TSCM services are available but can be costly.

### Case Study: Kid Rock Nightclub
A failed TSCM operation at a nightclub highlights the importance of thorough and professional counter-surveillance measures.

## Conclusion
Physical security is as important as digital security. By understanding and implementing these advanced techniques, organizations can better protect themselves from both internal and external threats.
