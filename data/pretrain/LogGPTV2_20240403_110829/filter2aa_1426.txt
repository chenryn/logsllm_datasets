“We Want Information… Information… Information… “ 
“You won’t get it.” 
“By hook or by crook, we will…” 
– The Prisoner (1967)
"Many of Russia's wealthiest banks and corporate tycoons 
have set up their own private security agencies, usually staffed 
with former KGB officers. Their task is to spy on their political 
and business enemies and to gather compromising material...
...the former KGB has fragmented into a multitude of private 
agencies that exploit their secret-police expertise for personal 
profit."
–Geoffrey York, The Globe and Mail, 7/8/00
"[US officials] say a record 108 nations were involved in trying 
to steal sensitive US technologies in 2005, the last year for 
which full data was available."
–James Kitfield, Air Force Magazine, March 2007
Blurring the line between industrial and government espionage
Hacking for exploration -> Hacking to steal money/information
Clever exploitation of technology -> Whatever gets the goods
Computer crime as a business
We’ve seen an explosion of computer crime in the past few years, and I’m not talking about people hacking the NSA so they listen in on Karl 
Rove’s cell phone. I mean the ﬂourishing industry in stolen credit card numbers. I mean people in Who-Knows-Where-istan using their botnets to 
wipe companies off the Web if they don’t pay protection money. And above all, I mean identity theft -- people taking out lines of credit using stolen 
ﬁnancial information. The thing is, Ivan P. Malwarovski doesn’t care about how he gets the information he needs to take people to the cleaners. It 
doesn’t matter to him whether he pulled off a great end-run around the IDS or whether he paid his buddy the ex-KGB agent to break into their ofﬁce 
and plant a laptop in the dropped ceiling. Ivan makes his money no matter what. And what if he isn’t in the identity theft business? Maybe he knows 
a Romanian commodities trader with a couple million left over from his last oil deal that he’d love to put towards some unorthodox market research. 
With modern ﬁnancial networks subject to all sorts of monitoring, he might be better off with a microphone above the boardroom ceiling than a 
laptop.

Elicitation
Recruitment
Infiltration
Elicitation...
"[the] subtle extraction of information during an apparently 
normal and innocent conversation."
                                                        – NASA
Elicitation
• NEVER ask 'the question'
Elicitation
• Play dumb-- make deliberately false statements. People love 
to correct errors.
Elicitation
• Get them involved in a game of one-upmanship.
Elicitation
• Ask for help.
Elicitation
• Flattery!
o "The greater the expert, the more he appreciates praise." 
– Christopher Nolan
Elicitation
• Ask sensitive questions in the middle of a conversation.
Elicitation
People usually only remember the beginning and the end of a conversation. You’ll probably only remember the beginning and end of the 
presentation
• It's all about putting together little pieces of information.
o Speak with many different people to fill in different parts of the 
picture.
 In each division of the company (technical, sales, etc.) a few people will know 
about the target project
o Outside the company, too:
 Customers
 Suppliers
 Trade journalists
 Professional societies
 Consultants
Elicitation
• Know when to stop.

Enemy Within: Recruiting Spies
"[Recruitment requires] incremental entrapment in a subtle web 
of irresistible compromises." – James Angleton, CIA counter-
spook
Recruitment
Gradual escalation
1. Spot the potential recruit
2. Do your homework
3. Get access to them
4. Develop them as a recruit
5. Recruit them
6. Profit!!!
Recruitment
Steps of recruitment
• People with access to:
o The information
o Other people (access agents)
• Make sure they aren't counter-spies
What to look for in a potential agent
o Their potential motivations
o Their habits/vices
Background work-- what do you want to know about someone in order to recruit them?
o Money
o Revenge (on a person)
o Revenge (on a government or system-- disaffection)
o Blackmail or hostage situation
o National pride
o Emotional involvement
o Naivete
o Sex
o Ideology
Why would they work for you?
o People who can get you in touch with the target. 
o Ideally they have connections in the target group or 
community, but prostitutes will do in a pinch.
What’s an access agent?
o Find recruits
o Make introductions
o Fuck
What do access agents do?
(I had a feeling that would get your attention.)

 KGB swallows and ravens
 the "secretaries offensive" / Romeo spies
 "Love, or a plausible semblance of it, was capable of 
generating more intelligence over a longer period than brief 
sexual encounters [and blackmail." –Mitrokhin / Andrew
Development, the nice way
1. Establish friendship
2. Ask for innocent or insignificant favor, and reward it 
generously
3. Wash, rinse, repeat. They become dependent on your 
money
4. Get them on the path to betrayal
• ask for the internal phonebook
5. Ask for something more sensitive, with a good excuse
Development, the mean way
• Make their life hell
• Offer to fix it– for a (small but significant) price.
• Escalate.
• Make the pitch.
• Be ready to blackmail.
KPMG / Guy Enright / Diligence, Inc
Story time.
• A fake resume and good interview skills will get you far.
o ...ditto with protest or political groups
 Heathrow Airport & C2i vs. Plane Stupid
• Temporary employees
o Construction worker + lunchbox full of radio transmitters 
and microphones = a night shift full of fun
What if you can’t spot a likely agent? Inﬁltrate!
• Tailgating
• Forged IDs
• Request to Exit Sensors
• Attack the mechanism
• Dropped ceilings
Maybe you just want to break in, Watergate style...
People are polite. Take advantage of them!
Tailgating: the ﬁne art of following legit users through a door
The man in charge of security at an unnamed military base wanted to check the security at his installation. He called up two of his drinking buddies 
who worked as staff in one of the more sensitive areas in the base, and proposed a little game... using his authority, he had passes made up for 
them that replaced the faces on their cards with those of African baboons, and offered them each a night of drinks if they could get in undetected 
for a solid week. They were only found out three months later when one of the staffers dropped his card in front of the guard -- the guard ﬁnally 
looked at the picture when he was picking it off the ﬂoor. Photo IDs suck.

Request to Exit Sensor (n):
Motion detector conveniently placed to save an attacker 
the trouble of picking the lock—by allowing him to use a 
helium balloon instead
• Sliding/carding/loiding
• Lockset vulnerabilities
• Breathe on the fingerprint sensor

o aka 'using a credit card'
 (don't actually do that)
deadlatch
latch
The card pushes or pulls the latch back when you slip it between the door and doorjamb. Sometimes even modern locks with deadlatches 
designed to prevent this are vulnerable -- either the locksmith installed the strikeplate in the door such that it doesn’t push back the little nub, or the 
door is using an electric strikeplate that doesn’t even try to engage the deadlatch.

Some electronic systems are really well designed and secure
Others aren’t. You can bypass a lot of keypads with the strategic use of yellow highlighter ink. It blends in great with the keys but ﬂuoresces under 
UV light, and ﬁngers track it from key to key so you can see what order the keys are pushed.
Sometimes, just your breath is enough.
If you breathe on some older ﬁngerprint locks, the lock will open-- your breath doesn’t condense 
where the last user’s ﬁngerprint left skin-oils.

Lock picking leaves no visible evidence of entry, and most mechanical locks can be picked
A priest, a rabbi, and a spy walk into an ofﬁce building.
The spy says to the receptionist,
“Mind if I use your restroom?”
Matt Blaze independently discovered and published a vulnerability in master-keyed pin tumbler 
locks that allows someone with a single key that ﬁts a single lock in the system to ﬁgure out the 
master key for the system. In short, they cut a series of six or seven keys (one for each pin in the 
lock). Each key is identical to the source (change) key, except for one pin position which is left 
uncut. To ﬁnd the master key, they try each key in the lock, and record which one(s) work. They 
repeat this again, cutting down each uncut position by one cut-depth, until they’ve reached the 
bottom cut depth. They now have at least two key-cut codes for the lock: one of which is the key 
they started with, one of which is the master key for the building, and maybe a few others whose 
purpose can be ﬁgured out with a little more work.
How the Watergate burglars were caught
Former CIA official and Watergate burglary-team member James McCord used duct tape on the 
stairwell door locks to prevent them from locking. While making his rounds, Watergate security 
guard Frank Willis noticed the duct tape and pulled it off, then continued on his rounds. But McCord 
was stupid and put more duct tape on—when the security guard saw that it had been replaced, he 
called the cops.
One more thing we can learn from Watergate
Dropped ceilings are really convenient. When they were caught, the Washington DC police found 
two ceiling panels had been taken down from the ceiling of the DNC secretary’s office. Since the 
secretary’s office was adjacent to that of the chairman’s, it was possible to place a bug above those 
panels that would listen to everything being said in the office. It didn’t matter how well the office 
was secured—the DNC chairman could have had the best lock in the world on his door, but the 
dropped ceiling panels that most people assume are the real ceiling were a wonderful backdoor.
“Gentlemen do not read each other’s mail.”
–Henry L. Stimson, US Secretary of State, 1931 
I guess that means all you gentlemanly types can safely skip over to that other awesome talk you 
were thinking of going to, because I’m going to talk about just those things Mr. Stimson hated.
Who’s expecting this guy?
Visual surveillance is the easiest and probably the most legal way of seeing what a target is up to. 
All it demands is access to a good vantage point, and modern optics will reveal a lot. Who expects 
someone to be looking in through a skyscraper’s window?
Not Boston’s MBTA, anyway.
As part of their research into the security of Boston’s MBTA subway system, my friends Zack 
Anderson, RJ Ryan, and Alessandro Chiesa realized that the main operations building was visible 
from publicly-accessible areas of a nearby office building. Through the magic of modern 
technology, they didn’t even need to get past the front desk in order to see what was going on 
inside.

Security staff at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Wolfsburg, Germany found a “babyphone” intercom 
concealed under the sofa in Porsche boss Wendelin Wideking’s room. According to hotel records, no 
family had stayed in the room for several weeks prior.

Digital Voice Recorders:
They’re even advertised as perfect for recording meetings!
What does your voice mail say about you?
Voice mail boxes are easy to password-guess
Why not just put a bug on the CEO?
Heck, why not get him to bug his own meeting,
and save us the trouble...
Wireless microphones are designed to provide crystal-clear 
audio at a decent range, consistently and reliably. Even to the 
guy with the radio in the parking lot.

Advanced Techniques
TEMPEST
Wim Van Eck discovered the ﬁne art of Van Eck Phreaking back in the 80s, even though the NSA had 
known about the trick since the 1950s–they called it TEMPEST. In short, TEMPEST attacks involve 
using the radiation emitted by electronics in the course of normal operation to ﬁgure out what 
those electronics are doing. The original Van Eck research used the signal emitted by CRTs to 
reconstruct the picture on the screen at a distance. Nowdays, LCDs make that a whole lot tougher—
so get your boss to buy you that 30” Cinema Display already....
But forget the wireless keyboard. Turns out some are pretty 
easy to intercept.
Phone taps
If you’re going to go great lengths to read someone’s email, you might as well listen to their phone 
calls too. If you’re Wal-Mart trying to hunt down people talking with the New York Times, pesky 
details like warrants aren’t a big obstacle to your investigation. [Bruce Gabbard story]
They should have hired Anthony Pellicano.
You can hide a transmitter just about anywhere.
You can hide a transmitter anywhere. No, seriously. Tell your paranoid boss he may want to go in

Heck, you can even hide the bug outside the room.
