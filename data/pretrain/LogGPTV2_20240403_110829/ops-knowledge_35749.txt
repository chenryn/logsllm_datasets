User: I want to open a file and tail -f the output.  I'd like to be able to open the file at the beginning of my test in a subprocess, execute the test, then process the output starting from the beginning of the tail.
I've tried using Run Process, but that just spins, as the process never terminates.  I tried using Start Process followed by Get Process Result, but I get an error saying Getting results of unfinished processes is not supported. 
Is this possible?
Assistant: There's no need to do tail -f. At the start of your test you can get the number of bytes in the file. Let the test run, and then read the file starting at the byte offset that you calculated earlier (or read the whole file, and use a slice to look at the new data)
