**User:**
I would like to open a file and use `tail -f` to follow the output. My goal is to start monitoring the file at the beginning of my test, run the test, and then process the output starting from the point where `tail -f` began.

I have tried using `Run Process`, but it just spins indefinitely because the process never terminates. I also attempted to use `Start Process` followed by `Get Process Result`, but I received an error stating that "Getting results of unfinished processes is not supported."

Is this possible?

**Assistant:**
Using `tail -f` may not be the most suitable approach for your use case. Instead, you can achieve your goal by following these steps:

1. At the start of your test, determine the current size (in bytes) of the file.
2. Run your test.
3. After the test completes, read the file starting from the byte offset you recorded earlier. Alternatively, you can read the entire file and use a slice to isolate the new data that was appended during the test.

This method avoids the need for `tail -f` and ensures that you can capture and process the new data efficiently.
