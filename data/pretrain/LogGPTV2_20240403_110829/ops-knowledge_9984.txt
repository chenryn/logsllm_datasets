When attempting to run `brew install pyqt --with-python3`, I encountered the following error: "Failed to determine the layout of your Qt installation." Upon adding `--verbose` to the brew script, it became clear that the issue was due to `ld` (the linker) being unable to find `-lgcc_s.10.5`. This occurred on Mac OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite.

To resolve this issue for others who may encounter it, here is the solution that worked for me:

1. **Upgrade Xcode**: First, upgrade Xcode to version 7.2. You can do this through the Mac App Store.
2. **Accept the License and Install Components**: Open Xcode once to accept the license agreement and allow it to install any additional components.
3. **Update Homebrew**: Run `brew update` to ensure you have the latest version of Homebrew.
4. **Install PyQt with Python 3**: Finally, run `brew install pyqt --with-python3`.

Following these steps, the installation should proceed without errors.
