User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Someone tried to log into my mail - what do I do? I have a 2-step verification system for both my gmail accounts. Today, I received a message with a code when I wasn't trying to log in.

So someone has my password. What's my next step here? What should I do?

Assistant: Change your password. Keep a strong password. Change your security question as some one close to you can easily guess the answer and get the access to your account.
