User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can't start apache... (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 When I run "sudo /usr/sbin/apache2ctl graceful" I get the following message:

httpd not running, trying to start
(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80
no listening sockets available, shutting down
Unable to open logs

When I run "sudo netstat -lnp | grep :80" I get:

tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:80            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      845/aolserver4-nsd

I assume aolserver is also running? How would I get apache to run?

Assistant: You have another webserver running already. You have to stop or kill it before you can start Apache (or change one of them to a non-standard port, ie something other than port 80).
