### Privacy and Security Analysis of Social Networks

#### LinkedIn
To conduct our analysis, we needed to use a custom crawler because the operation required a logged-in user. While LinkedIn restricts access to its group directory, the public member directory is more accessible. Public member profiles, though less detailed for privacy reasons, still contain membership status and group IDs for all groups a member has joined. This indicates that group and group membership data are not considered security-relevant. Since these profiles can be freely accessed over the web, an attacker can use automated third-party services to gather information for de-anonymization attacks.

In a separate experiment, we used an external crawling service to crawl the public profiles of three million randomly selected members from LinkedIn's member directory. The cost was $6.57, and based on a linear cost model, we estimate the total cost to crawl all 40 million public profiles at around $88. This small investment would allow an attacker to target all LinkedIn group members in a de-anonymization attack.

#### Other Social Networks
To determine the generality of the problem, we manually analyzed five additional popular social networks that share features with the ones we studied in detail. Table II shows the relevant features for these networks. All networks are vulnerable to history stealing and de-anonymization via groups. Although we did not conduct crawling experiments for these networks, we expect the results and techniques to be similar to those described here. Our empirical results demonstrate that group memberships are generally not considered privacy-relevant in many social networks.

### Evaluation of De-Anonymization Attack Feasibility

#### Analytical Results
To evaluate the effectiveness of our de-anonymization attack, we performed an analytical analysis of Xing. We have comprehensive data, including all public and several closed groups, along with their member information. Here are the key parameters:

- **Total Unique Users**: Over 1.8 million in 6,466 public and 108 closed groups.
- **Average Groups per User**: 3.49.
- **Total Group Member Sizes**:
  - Public Groups: Over 5.7 million.
  - Closed Groups: About 4.4 million.
- **Average Group Size**:
  - Public Groups: 914 members.
  - Closed Groups: 296 members.

The closed groups we crawled contain 404,548 unique users, but 81.34% (329,052) were already covered by the public groups in our dataset. This suggests that focusing on public groups can provide substantial information, while the practical impact of closed groups is relatively low due to the increased effort required to access them.

#### Information Gain and Greedy Search
For the de-anonymization attack to be effective, the history stealing step must find at least one group that the victim is a member of. As the number of probed groups increases, it is crucial to see how the number of unique users grows. We compared two strategies: greedy search (probing the largest groups first) and information gain (choosing groups with the most unseen members).

- **Greedy Search**: Probes the largest groups first.
- **Information Gain**: Chooses groups with the most unseen members.

Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of unique users seen after crawling a specific number of groups. Even after testing only a few hundred groups, a significant percentage of users (over 50%) were seen at least once. After testing 1,108 groups, 90% of users were seen at least once. When restricting the search to groups with fewer than 20,000 members, we could still find over 90% of users.

The difference between the greedy and information gain strategies is small, with the information gain strategy requiring fewer groups (6,277 vs. 6,571) to cover all users.

#### Candidate Set Sizes
Assuming a successful history stealing attack, we computed the group fingerprint Î“(v) for each victim. Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of candidate set sizes after set intersection. For 42.06% of users, the group fingerprint is exact, allowing unique identification. For one million users, the candidate set can be narrowed down to fewer than 32 users, and for 90% of users, the set is reduced to less than 2,912 users.

#### Real-World Experiments
To demonstrate the practical feasibility, we created a website that performs a de-anonymization attack against Xing. In a controlled experiment with 26 volunteers, we successfully de-anonymized 15 users. In a public experiment, 9,969 participants completed the de-anonymization attack. The results show that our attack works in practice.

#### Performance Benchmark
We tested the performance of history stealing attacks on major web browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome) on different operating systems (Windows Vista, Ubuntu Linux, Mac OS X). Safari on both Mac OS X and Windows achieved the best results, with 90,000 tests taking less than 20 seconds. Chrome was about 25% slower, Firefox required 48 to 59 seconds, and Internet Explorer took 70 seconds. Even for Internet Explorer, over 13,000 URLs could be probed in less than 10 seconds.

#### Fluctuation in Groups
Group and member changes over time can affect the accuracy of the de-anonymization attack. An attacker may need to recrawl parts or the entire social network periodically to maintain accurate data. The stability of group data directly influences the effort required for the attack.

### Conclusion
Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that de-anonymization attacks are feasible and can be conducted with relatively small investments. Group memberships, often not considered privacy-relevant, can be exploited to identify users across social networks.
