Table II: Vulnerability Comparison of Social Networks.
this operation requires a logged-in user, we had to use our
custom crawler.
While LinkedIn restricts access to its group directory, we
found this not to be the case for its public member directory.
For privacy reasons, the public member proﬁles are much
less detailed than the regular proﬁles within the social net-
work. Surprisingly, though, they do contain the membership
status and group IDs for all groups that a member has
joined. Clearly, data on groups and group memberships does
not seem to be regarded as being security-relevant. As the
public member proﬁles can be freely accessed over the web,
an attacker can use automated legal third-party services to
fully “outsource” the information gathering phase of the de-
anonymization attack.
In a different crawling scenario, we performed an exper-
iment and used an external crawling service to crawl the
public proﬁles of three million members that we randomly
picked from LinkedIn’s member directory. The costs for
the crawling were $6.57. Assuming a linear cost model,
we estimate overall costs of about $88 for crawling all 40
million public proﬁles. This small investment would allow
an attacker to target all group members of LinkedIn in a
de-anonymization attack.
4) Other Social Networks:
In order to ﬁnd out how
generic the problem of group information disclosure is, we
manually analyzed ﬁve additional popular social networks
that share features with the three networks that we analyzed
in more detail.
Table II shows the features that are related to our de-
anonymization scenario for these networks. All networks
are vulnerable to history stealing and de-anonymization via
groups. While we did not conduct crawling experiments
for these networks, we expect the results and techniques
to be similar to the ones we described in this section. Our
empirical results demonstrate that group memberships are
generally not considered as being privacy-relevant in many
social networks.
V. EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the practical feasibility of the
de-anonymization attack.
A. Analytical Results
To assess the effectiveness of our de-anonymization at-
tack, we ﬁrst perform an analytical analysis of Xing. For
Figure 3: Cumulative distribution for number of unique users
seen after crawling a speciﬁc number of groups (Xing).
this social network, we have a comprehensive overview.
More precisely, we have crawled all public and several
closed groups, together with all member information for
these groups. We start with an overview of the different
parameters of that network related to our attack scenario.
In total, we collected membership information for more
than 1.8 million unique users in 6,466 public and 108 closed
groups. From the claimed 8 million Xing users, at least 1.8
million are thus affected by our attack and we study them
in the following. Based on our data, the average Xing user
is a member of 3.49 groups. By using data from Xing’s
group directory, we found that for the whole network, the
sum of group member sizes (i.e., the number of membership
relations) for the 6,466 public groups totals to more than 5.7
million. In contrast, the 15,373 closed groups only contain
about 4.4 million membership relations. Furthermore, the
average size of public groups is 914 members, whereas it
is only 296 members for closed groups. The closed groups
that we crawled contain 404,548 unique users. However, of
these users, 329,052 (81.34%) were already covered by the
public groups in our dataset.
These ﬁgures indicate that an attacker can already collect
a substantial amount of information by only focusing on
public groups. The practical impact of closed groups appears
to be rather low, given the increased effort that is necessary
for gaining membership data for closed groups.

As mentioned in Section III,
improved de-
anonymization attack requires that the history stealing step
ﬁnds at least one group k that the victim is a member of
(that is, Γkv = 1 for at least one k). Thus, when probing
for an increasing number of groups, it is interesting to see
how the number of unique users grows that appear in at least
one of these groups. When this number grows quickly, the
attacker has a good chance to get a “hit” after inspecting a
small number of groups.
Of course, one also needs to consider the order in which
the history stealing step should probe for group membership:
Clearly, the attacker wants to optimize the process such that
he sees each user at least once after as few attempts as
possible. One approach is to perform a greedy search. That
is, the attacker ﬁrst probes the largest group, then the second
largest group, and so on. The problem is that this order
might not be optimal, since it does not take into account
group membership overlaps. An alternative approach is to
choose the groups by information gain (i.e., in each step,
test the group which has most members not seen before).
This might lead to a better probing procedure, since the
attacker covers in each step the largest possible number of
previously-unseen users.
Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution for the number
of unique users seen after crawling a speciﬁc number of
groups. Besides considering all groups, we also studied the
effect of limiting the search space to groups with at most
50,000 and 20,000 members, respectively. This takes into
account that really large groups with hundreds of thousands
of members are too large to probe efﬁciently. Thus, we
restrict an attack to groups with an upper bound on the group
size. The results indicate that an attack is very effective in
practice: Even after testing only a few hundred groups, we
have seen a signiﬁcant percentage of all users at least once
(i.e., a speciﬁc user is a member of at least one of the groups
we have tested so far). In fact, we have seen more than 50%
of the users after testing only 61 groups. After testing 1,108
groups, we have seen 90% of the users at least once. When
restricting the search space, we can observe that we do not
ﬁnd each member at least once since some users are only
member of large groups. Nevertheless, we can ﬁnd more
than 90% of the overall users when only considering groups
smaller than 20,000 members.
Figure
3 also shows that the difference between the
greedy and the information strategy is small. More precisely,
the overall shape is very similar, only the number of tested
group is signiﬁcantly different: With the information gain
strategy, an attacker only needs to probe 6,277 groups until
he has seen each user at least once, whereas the brute-force
approach requires to test 6,571 of all 6,574 groups before
the complete set of users (who are part of at least one group)
is covered.
For our next analysis, we assume that the attacker has
successfully launched a history stealing attack and has com-

puted an accurate group ﬁngerprint Γ(v) for a victim v. This
allows the attacker to use the fast de-anonymization attack
based on set intersection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
this attack, we show in Figure 4 the cumulative distribution
of the candidate set sizes after set intersection. Each user
in the candidate set needs to be inspected by the basic
attack. Thus, a smaller size is favorable for the attacker.
Interestingly, for 42.06% of the users that use groups (=
753,357 users), the group ﬁngerprint is exact. That is, only a
single user in the social network is a member of exactly these
groups. These users can be uniquely identiﬁed just based on
their group ﬁngerprint, and no additional steps are required.
For one million users, we can narrow down the candidate set
to less than 32 users, and for 90% of all users, the candidate
set is reduced from initially ∼1.8 million to less than 2,912
users. These results show that one can signiﬁcantly narrow
down the search space of candidates (who are then compared
against the victim, one by one, using the basic attack).

ing page explains the purpose of the experiment to visitors.
Then, the visitors need to explicitly acknowledge that they
would like to participate in the experiment. Once a visitor
decides to take part, she also needs to ﬁll out a brief
questionnaire that asks her about how she uses the social
network, if she shares her computer or user account with
someone else, and how often she participates in social
networking groups.
Once the experiment starts, the visitor’s browsing history
is probed for the URL of the main web page of Xing. If
this URL is not present in the history, we assume that the
visitor has not used Xing recently, or that she has disabled
her browsing history (see the discussion in Section VI). In
this case, we abort the de-anonymization attempt, and do
not proceed.
If we do identify that a user has visited Xing before, we
then use history stealing to probe for the URLs of the groups
within Xing. That is, for each group, we check the visitor’s
browsing history for dynamic group links. We only expect
these links to be present in the browsing history of users
who are indeed members of these groups. We then perform
the analysis based on the obtained group ﬁngerprint, and
present the result to the user.
Results for Control Group: In a ﬁrst phase, we only
promoted this website to volunteers that we picked from our
personal contacts. This ensured that we had control over the
participants and also background information about them.
In total, we launched our attack on 26 volunteers from our
Xing contacts. For 11 of these visitors, we could not ﬁnd any
dynamic links that indicated interaction with groups in their
browsing history. The reasons for this can be manifold, for
example only seldom usage of groups or regularly ﬂushing
the browsing history.
For the remaining 15 visitors, we could determine group
ﬁngerprints, and successfully launched de-anonymization
attacks. More precisely, we could leverage the faster group
intersection variant of the attack, and could compute in-
tersection sets for 11 visitors. The median size of these
intersection sets was only 570 members,
thus a search
within this set can be performed easily. For 4 visitors, we
had to fallback to the more robust, but slower union set-
based variant of our attack. As expected, the union set is
signiﬁcantly larger compared to the intersection set:
the
median size was 30,013 members, which can nevertheless
be probed during a history stealing attack.
In summary, our experiment with a control group shows
that our attack works in practice. We managed to de-
anonymize 15 of 26 users who participated in this exper-
iment.
Results for Public Experiment: We also performed the
experiment with a larger user base: our attack was covered
by several press reports, which also linked to the experimen-
tal website, and thus lead to many participants from all over
Figure 6: Cumulative distribution for the number of users
seen in the candidate set (Facebook).
Extracting a partial group ﬁngerprint for a victim v
might not always work ﬂawlessly (for reasons discussed in
Section III). As a result, the fast de-anonymization attack
based on set intersection could fail. In this case, the attacker
needs to resort to the slower but more robust attack based
on set union. In Figure 5, we show the cumulative distribu-
tion of the candidate set sizes when performing set union.
Compared to the candidate sets from Figure 4, the union
sets are considerably larger due to the fact that we merge
each group for which we have a match. Second, there is
still a signiﬁcant reduction in size compared to the overall
number of users in Xing for a larger fraction of victims.
For example, the set union attack still reduces the size of
candidate set to less than 50,000 for more than 72% of all
users on Xing.
We performed the same kind of analysis for Facebook.
Since we did not completely crawl this social network, the
results in Figure 6 provide an overview for the snapshot of
group information we obtained during our experiment. For
the 43.2 million users we have seen in 31,853 groups, 9.9
million have an exact group ﬁngerprint Γ(v). Furthermore,
for 25.2 million users, the size of the candidate set is smaller
than 1,000. The distribution of users in a candidate set of
a given size is different compared to the Xing experiment,
but we expect that the shape of the cumulative distribution
to also be similar for Facebook if an attacker has crawled
the complete network.
B. Real-World Experiments
To demonstrate the practical feasibility of our attack, we
created a website that performs a de-anonymization attack
against Xing. While there is no technical restriction that
limits our attack scheme to a speciﬁc network, we chose
to only implement it for Xing, as our crawling experiments
had covered the highest fraction of groups and members for
this network.

fox, Safari, Chrome) on different operating systems (i.e.,
Windows Vista, Ubuntu Linux, Mac OS X). We did not test
mobile browsers since social networks typically implement a
speciﬁc version of their platform for these browsers which
is not susceptible to our attack. The test machine was a
MacBook Pro with a 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor
and 4 GB RAM. We booted the operating system natively on
the machine, and used no virtualization software to prevent
side-effects. In each test case, we measured the time it takes
to perform a history stealing attack by checking a speciﬁc
number of URLs (i.e., we check if these URLs have been
visited or not): That is, we started with 1,000 URLs, and
we increased the number of URLs to be checked in steps of
thousand until we reached 90,000. We performed each test
ten times, and calculated the mean values. These values are
shown in Figure 7. In order to increase readability, and since
the mean error between individual runs was always below
5%, we omit error bars.
Safari on both Mac OS X and Windows achieved the
best results in our experiments: A history stealing attack
with 90,000 tests can be performed in less than 20 seconds.
Chrome is about 25% slower, while Firefox requires between
48 and 59 seconds, depending on the operating system. The
slowest performance was measured for Internet Explorer,
which took 70 seconds to probe all pages. Nevertheless,
even for Internet Explorer, we could probe more than 13,000
URLs in less than 10 seconds. Together with the results from
Figure 3, this show that an attacker can detect many groups
of a victim in a small amount of time.
D. Fluctuation in Groups
Another aspect we need to consider is the ﬂuctuation rate
in groups. From the viewpoint of an attacker, it is interesting
to understand how the groups and members in a social
network change over time.
First, it is unlikely that an attacker has access to the
networking and computing capacity that would enable her to
take a complete snapshot of a social network (i.e., permit her
to collect the necessary data for a de-anonymization attack
in a time span that is short enough to prevent any change
in both groups and members). In practice, depending on the
size of the network and the attacker’s resources, the duration
from start to end of crawling and the reconstruction of the
groups directory might take days, or even weeks.
Second, there will also be changes that are caused by
normal user behavior after the initial crawling phase. For
example, members will join or leave groups, or new groups
will be created. Over time, these changes cause the crawled
data to increasingly deviate from the real conﬁguration of
groups and members in the network. Determining how stable
the group data is, is related to the question of how often
an attacker would have to recrawl parts or the entire social
network. Hence, this directly inﬂuences how much effort
