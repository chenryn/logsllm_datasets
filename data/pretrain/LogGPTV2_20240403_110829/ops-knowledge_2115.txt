User: How to implement password-free login for SSH connections?
Assistant: To implement password-free login through SSH connections, the following steps are required: 1. Generate a public-private key pair: Use the ssh-keygen command on the client machine to generate a public-private key pair. You can use the default settings and press Enter all the way to complete the generation process. 2. Copy the public key to the server: Use the ssh-copy-id command to copy the client's public key to the authorized_keys file of the target server. 3. Test login: Try to log in to the server using the ssh command to see if you can successfully log in without password. Note: When using the ssh-copy-id command, you need to provide the correct username and IP address of the target server. If the ssh-copy-id command is not working, you can manually copy the public key into the authorized_keys file. In addition, you need to give the authorized_keys file the correct permissions when copying the public key, otherwise the password-free login will fail. You should set the permission of authorized_keys to 600 (that is, only the owner can read and write), and ensure that the permissions of the directory where the file is located do not allow other users to access it. If the above steps are performed in the correct way, the password-free login of the SSH connection can be realized.
