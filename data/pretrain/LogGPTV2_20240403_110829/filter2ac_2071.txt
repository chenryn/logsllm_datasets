### ATT&CK ID: T1505.004
### ATT&CK Technique Name: IIS Components

Adversaries may install malicious components on Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers to establish persistence. IIS offers multiple mechanisms to extend the functionality of web servers, which can be exploited by attackers. 

#### ISAPI Extensions and Filters
Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters are common ways to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests. These components are deployed as DLL files that must export the following functions:
- `Get{Extension/Filter}Version`: Provides version information.
- `Http{Extension/Filter}Proc`: Processes the HTTP request or response.
- (Optional) `Terminate{Extension/Filter}`: Performs cleanup when the extension or filter is unloaded.

#### IIS Modules
In addition to ISAPI components, adversaries may also install IIS modules to extend the functionality of the web server. These modules can be used to inject custom logic into the IIS pipeline, potentially allowing for persistent backdoors or other malicious activities.

By leveraging these IIS components, attackers can maintain a foothold in the target environment, enabling them to perform further actions such as data exfiltration, command and control, or additional lateral movement.
