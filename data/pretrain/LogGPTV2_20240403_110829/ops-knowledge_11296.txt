User: Please describe the common types of DDoS attacks and how to prevent them.
Assistant: Common types of DDoS attacks include: 1. SYN Flood attack: The attacker sends a large number of forged SYN requests, causing the server's resources to be exhausted and unable to respond to normal requests. Prevention method: Use the firewall to set the maximum SYN waiting queue length and SYN retransmission times, shorten the timeout period, and limit TCP connections. 2. UDP Flood attack: The attacker continues to send a large number of UDP packets to the target server, causing the server to be overloaded and unable to process other requests normally. Prevention method: limit open UDP ports, set IP access control list, and limit the number of packets sent from the same IP address. 3. HTTP Flood attack: The attacker simulates a large number of HTTP requests, occupying the bandwidth and processing power of the server. Prevention method: use CDN distributed cache service, set the maximum connection limit, set the request frequency and traffic limit. 4. DNS attack: The attacker sends a large number of DNS query requests, which overloads the DNS server and makes the website unable to be accessed normally. Prevention method: use DNS cache service, limit the frequency and quantity of requests for the same IP address, and limit unauthorized queries. 5. ICMP attack: The attacker sends a large number of ICMP requests, causing the server to be overloaded. Prevention method: limit the response to ICMP requests, and use reverse path verification to filter illegal requests. In short, various strategies and technologies are required to prevent DDoS attacks, including network traffic analysis, intrusion detection, firewall settings, protocol filtering, traffic restriction, and so on. At the same time, it is also necessary to regularly check and update security settings to ensure system security and stability.
