Bash script, yes, a bash script…

years worth of Mountain Dew

Power of the tool lies in smbclient & 
winexe
•
smbclient to get/put files
•
winexe to execute

•
Standard msf payloads with psexec module 
kept getting popped by AV
•
Custom exes also popped because AV 
trigger is on injection (service protection)
•
Damn you trend micro, but thanks for the 
motivation

Upload and execute your payload
Why write smbexec?

I want my shells and I want them now!
•
Creates an obfuscated payload that will 
bypass most commercial AV
•
Enable Hyperion Crypter to encrypt the payload
•
Creates a Metasploit rc file and launches a 
Metasploit listener to make things “easy.”
•
Attack can be launched in xterm or screen

and native windows commands?

•
winexe is similar to sysinternals psexec and 
the --system flag is awesome
•
No “payload” necessary
•
Looks like normal Windows traffic to OPSEC.
•
Successful logins and not much else

The caveats…there’s always 
something
You need a credential with admin rights for the 
system (local or domain)
•
administrator:password can usually get you 
started in 9 out of 10 corporate networks
•
NBNS spoofing
•
ettercap
•
Of course there’s always MS08-067 ;-)

•
winexe creates a service, could be stopped or 
become a red flag
•
Sometimes AV doesn't like wce
•
wce included with smbexec has been obfuscated 
with the approval of the original developer
•
Authentication over port 139 or 445 is required
•
Locard's exchange principle "Every contact 
leaves a trace"
