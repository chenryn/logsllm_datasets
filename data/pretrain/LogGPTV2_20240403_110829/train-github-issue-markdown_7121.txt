I think its really nice that you can put the terminal-tabs in your titlebar
but I got an issue there.
You can't move the window around klicking on the blank space in the the-bar to
move the window around (highlighted in the screenshot).
Since people are moving their terminal quite often it would be nice to offer
this space, so you can drag your terminal around.
