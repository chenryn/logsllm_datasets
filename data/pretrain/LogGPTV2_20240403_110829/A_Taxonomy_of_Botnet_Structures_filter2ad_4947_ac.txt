highly connected “hubs” nodes, and many leaf nodes with
fewer connections. This has a signiﬁcant impact on the op-
eration of the network. As discussed in Section 3, random
node failures tend to strike low-degree bots, making the net-
work resistant to random patching and loss. Targeted re-
sponses, however, can select the high degree nodes, leading
to dramatic decay in the operation of the network. This phe-
nomenon is explored in many articles, e.g., [5].
Researchers have noted that bots tend to organize in scale
free structures, or even star topologies [11, 15, 17]. For ex-
ample, botnets might use IRCd [27] for coordination, which
explicitly uses a hub architecture.
2.6.4 P2P Models
In a P2P model,
there are structured and unstructured
topologies [45, 48]. For example, a structured P2P network
might use CHORD [52], or CAN [48], while an unstruc-
tured P2P might use the hub-and-spoke networks created
330330
The unstructured P2P networks tend to have power-law
link distributions [45]. We therefore treat this type of P2P
network as a Barab´asi-Albert (scale free) model in our anal-
ysis. Similarly, structured P2P networks are similar to ran-
dom networks, in the sense that every node has almost the
same degree.
In Section 3, we observe new P2P-based botnets, and
perform some measurements on their structures. Since
our selected metrics concern only basic botnet properties
(length, giant, and local transitivity), we can treat these net-
works as random or scale free in our analysis. We encourage
others to reﬁne these models to identify distinct P2P botnet
features that distinguish them from random and scale free
networks. For the metrics proposed in this work, however,
we will address P2P botnets as special cases of the previous
categories.
3 Taxonomy-Driven Botnet Response Strate-
gies
The previous discussion of botnet organization suggests
the need for diverse response strategies. To guide future re-
search in this developing area, we model different responses
to each botnet category. Our analysis conﬁrms the pre-
vailing wisdom [13] that command-and-control is often the
weak link of a botnet. We conﬁrm our model with an empir-
ical analysis of a real-world botnet response. Signiﬁcantly,
our analysis also shows that targeting the botnet C&C is
not always an effective response. Some botnets will require
new response strategies that research must provide.
3.1 Erd¨os-R´enyi and P2P Models
For ranges appropriate to botnets, we evaluate the rela-
tionship between node degree, k, and the diameter of the
botnet, expressed as l−1. We assume that, to evade triv-
ial detection, botnets will attempt to limit (cid:4)k(cid:5) to some value
similar to P2P. Empirical studies of P2P systems reveal very
low median link scores (e.g., k ≈ 5.5) [33, 49]. Figure 2(a)
plots (cid:4)k(cid:5) against l−1 for realistic values, k ≤ 20. Others
have noted that for increasing average degrees, (cid:4)k(cid:5), random
Erdos-Renyi models have logarithmically increasing diam-
eters [23]. However, in Figure 2(a), realistic values of k
show a linear relationship to l−1.
We also note that giant, s, improves signiﬁcantly with
increases in k, enabling connections with most of the bot-
net when k ≈ 10 for a 5K botnet. This agrees with the
general principle noted in Eqn. (3), where logarithmically
connected networks enjoy nearly universal broadcasting.
Local transitivity, γ, also increases logarithmically with
k. But for a range of small values of k, typical of botnets,
it shows a linear increase. This means that each additional

(b) Random Loss in Botnets

value of k equally improves the general robustness of the
botnet. We also note a slight ﬂare at the base of the γ plot
for Figure 2(a), for very low values of k. Intuitively, this
means botnets with a very low average degree have difﬁ-
culty forming triads, but this is quickly overcome as k in-
creases. Botmasters therefore have incentives to increase
k.
Our current analysis, however, shows that for botnets us-
ing a random topology, random loss (e.g., infrequent user
patching or anecdotal cleanup) will not diminish the num-
ber of triads in the botnet. We also omit plotting the perfor-
mance of random networks under targeted responses. Tar-
geting nodes can at best remove a few nodes with k slightly
higher than (cid:4)k(cid:5). The result is asymptotically the same as
random loss.
The work in [55] is a good example of a hybrid botnet
with a random graph structure formed using a technique
similar to Erd¨os-R´enyi graph, through the use of a peer list.
They also conﬁrm the robustness of such networks against
targeted and random attacks. The work in [54] is also a good
example of botnets created using a random graph structure.
In section 2 we noted that structured P2P networks are
very similar to random networks, at least in terms of the
metrics we care about: length, giant and transitivity. Struc-
tured P2P networks in fact have a constant k (often set equal
to the log N size of the network), so they are slightly more
stable than purely random networks. Thus, changes in γ
and s, and l−1 are constant with the loss of random nodes.
Clearly botnets with random topologies (including struc-
tured P2P networks) are therefore extremely resilient, and
deserve further study. We speculate that the most effec-
tive response strategies will include technologies to remove
large numbers of nodes at once. Detecting and cleaning up
large numbers of victims (perhaps at the host level) appears
to be the most viable strategy. Likewise, strategies that dis-
rupt the ability of the network to maintain indices may be
fruitful, as suggested by the P2P index poisoning research
in [51].
3.2 Watts-Strogatz Models
There are some experimental botnets [32] that use small
world structures, but overall they do not appear to have a
high utility value, using the metrics we have proposed. The
average degree in a small world is (cid:4)k(cid:5) ≈ r, or the number of
local links in a graph. Thus, random and targeted responses
to a small world botnet produce the same result: the loss
of r links with each removed node. Thus, the key metrics
for botnets, s, γ, l−1 all decay at a constant rate in a small
world.
We presumed that shortcut links in a small world botnet
are not used (P = 0), but even if present, they would not
affect γ with r ≥ 4. That is, if the number of local links is
large enough to form triads, the absence of shortcuts does
not signiﬁcantly increase the number of triads (which are
already formed by r local neighbors).
There may be other beneﬁts (e.g., propagation stealth
or anonymity), for which we have not proposed a utility
metric. But overall, small world botnets do not have bene-
ﬁts different from random networks. In other domains, re-
searchers have noted that small world graphs are essentially
random [23].
Our investigation of experimental of botnet structures
only reveals one representative of the Watts-Strogatz model:
the Zindos [32] worm. We speculate that the poor utility
scores in the face of targeted and random loss may explain
331331
this phenomena. An equally likely explanation is hinted at
by Zou, et al., in [60], where the authors noted the desire of
botmasters to avoid revealing a lists of confederate botnet
members to honeypot operators.
3.3 Barab´asi-Albert and P2P Models
While random networks present a challenge, at least
scale free networks provide some good news for re-
searchers. Figure 3(a) plots the change in diameter and
transitivity against changes in the “core” size of the bot-
net, C. The “core” of a scale free botnet is the number of
high-degree central nodes–the routers and hubs used to co-
ordinate the soldier bots. As more core nodes are added, the
diameter of the scale free botnet stays nearly constant for
small regions of C. Intuitively, splitting a hub into smaller
hubs does not signiﬁcantly increase the length of the overall
network.
The local minima in Figure 3(a) has an intuitive explana-
tion. If we have a single hub in a scale free network, C = 1,
many of the added leaf nodes have a good chance of form-
ing triads. The scale-free generation algorithm we chose
prefers high degree nodes, and tends to form many triads
when there are few hubs.
As we increase C, we create several high degree hubs
that attract distinct groups of leaf nodes. This creates many
“squares”, where hubs are connected to each other, and
leaves are connected to each other. But transitivity is only
measured locally (in triads, and not other polygon paths).
Thus, increasing C diminishes γ slightly. As we increase
C more, we observe a tendency for the hubs themselves to
form triads, so γ grows logarithmically.
Can botmasters avoid this drop in transitivity? We sus-
pect not, if they wish to maintain a “normal” degree count,
relative to other applications. In Figure 3(c), we compare
changes in γ against core size using different link counts
for leaf nodes. If nodes have more links, m ≈ 16, the loss
in γ shallows out. But increasing the link count of nodes
can help anomaly detection algorithms that examine link
degrees (e.g., ﬂow log analysis). This reveals a curious mix
of incentives. On the one hand botmasters would like to
have C >> 1, since a single core node is too easily re-
moved. But increasing C just a little drops local transitivity.
To recover the loss in transitivity, botmasters would have to
increase link counts to rates far in excess of average P2P
degree counts.
Responses to scale free botnets are more effective. As
expected, random losses in scale free botnets are easily ab-
sorbed. Figure 3(b) shows that random patching has al-
most no affect on a botnet diameter or the frequency of
triad clusters. Intuitively, because of the power law distri-
bution of node degrees, random losses tend to affect low-
degree nodes (e.g., the leaves), and not important nodes
(e.g., hubs).
Targeted responses, however, can select key nodes for re-
sponse. This results in a dramatic increase in diameter, and
loss of transitivity. This suggests that researchers should
focus on technologies that allow targeted responses to high-
degree nodes in botnets. Figure 3(b) validates the intuitive
idea that by removing a botnet C&C, the network quickly
disintegrates into a collection of discrete, uncoordinated in-
fections.
As noted in [47], measuring aspects of botnets presents a
challenge to researchers. To demonstrate the practicality of
our proposed metrics, we measured the average link degree
in an unstructured P2P botnet. We selected the nugache
worm [41], and measured the degree of connections be-
tween neighbors in the network mesh. Nugache uses a link
encrypted, peer-to-peer ﬁlesharing protocol, WASTE [1],
and uses several hard-coded IP addresses to request a list of
peers to from [41]. After connecting to peers, the bot dis-
covers more peers and continue to form new connections.
The resulting botnet is an unstructured P2P network, which
tends to create a scale-free form. Thus, although nugache
spreads by P2P systems, the resulting mesh is a scale-free
network.
Since we believe our data collection technique is some-
what unusual, we describe it in some detail. We note that
obtaining precise measurements is, of course, nearly im-
possible given the distributed nature of nugache. We there-
fore ran multiple instances of the nugache worm in a modi-
ﬁed version of WINE [2], which guaranteed that each copy
would obtain a unique IP when a network socket is al-
located under bind() system calls. Thus, using a sin-
gle multi-homed machine, we “controlled” hundreds of nu-
gache nodes and were able to observe their connections to
the rest of the victims in the wild. (This is similar to the
use of numerous heavy-weight honeypots to track botnets,
noted in [13].) We ran two such “batch WINE runs” for
several weeks, creating hundreds of nodes, and measured
the connections degree among our subsample of the overall
population.
Figure 4(a) shows the distribution of link degrees found
in the Nugache sample. The vast majority of victims main-
tained less than 6 links to other victims. There are a few
nodes with a very high degree, ≈ 30. This suggests a scale-
free network typical of unstructured P2P networks. Our
sampling technique unfortunately could not inject nodes
into the inner ring of the nugache network (created from
the hard-coded peers), where we would expect to observe a
very high link degree.
If we had contacted the owners of the low-degree nu-
gache nodes we observed, or otherwise caused their remedi-
ation and cleanup, our impact on the network’s utility would
have been negligible, according to our analysis. Our model
above shows that random losses in scale free networks (and
