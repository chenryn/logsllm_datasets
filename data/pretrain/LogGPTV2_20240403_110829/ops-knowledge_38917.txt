User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Records (logs) in nginx, blank are created but not updated I am getting the locomotive, I have stopped working the logs, I have created them again, I have the subdomains with the logs turned on, I checked the configuration up and down nginx and it does not work, only a registry works that created a post error.log in /var/log/nginx and that is updated when you start nginx, the rest of logs are created as I have them configured in site-avalible, but they are blank
An example of the created logs:

-rw-r----- 1 www-data adm 0 May 26 10:42 blog_access.log
-rw-r----- 1 www-data adm 0 May 26 10:42 blog_error.log

This is the only one that works:

-rw-r----- 1 www-data adm 14591 May 26 12:40 error.log

It compiles when nginx is installed:

--http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log
--error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log

I do not understand why taking the rest of logs with the same permissions and owners that error.log does not work?

Assistant: Restarting the server was solved
