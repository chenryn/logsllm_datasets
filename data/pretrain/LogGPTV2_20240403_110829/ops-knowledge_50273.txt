User: Please estimate system scalability and performance bottlenecks based on the following server hardware configurations, and provide corresponding solutions. The hardware configuration of a server is: Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 (2.4GHz, 14 cores and 28 threads), 128GB memory, four 960GB SSD hard drives, 10 Gigabit network card, and the operating system is Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS. Running an online shopping mall website, it is estimated that 100,000 users visit every day, the average number of pages visited by each user is 10, and the average size of each page is 1MB.
Assistant: 1. System scalability: The server hardware configuration is relatively high, with the Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS operating system, the system scalability is acceptable. However, if the number of users and pages visited by the website increases, it may cause a performance bottleneck. 2. Performance bottleneck: Considering that the number of pages accessed by each user is 10, and the size of each page is 1MB, if 100,000 users visit, the total traffic per day is about 100,000 * 10 * 1MB = 1TB. Therefore, there may be a disk I/O bottleneck, especially for the life of the SSD hard drive. In addition, if there are many simultaneous access users, there may be CPU and memory bottlenecks. 3. Solution: In order to solve the disk I/O bottleneck problem, the following optimization measures can be carried out: - Use RAID 10 mode to combine hard disks to improve disk read and write speed and data reliability - Store static files and dynamic files separately Reduce read and write pressure on different hard disks - configure caching strategies to cache files with high access rates in memory to reduce disk I/O In order to solve CPU and memory bottlenecks, you can perform the following optimization measures: - For applications Rendering can be distributed and processed by using multiple CPU cores - you can adjust the parameters of the system kernel and applications to maximize the use of system resources - consider using a load balancing strategy to distribute access requests to multiple servers In short, the choice of optimization strategy needs to take into account the actual website architecture and server usage environment, and timely adjustment and optimization are necessary.
