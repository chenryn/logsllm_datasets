We use Python networkx to reconstruct the network graphs and
compute shortest paths, and Google Maps API to visualize them.
Our online repository [14] contains all our code for data scraping
together with the collected data, as well as code and outputs for
network reconstruction and visualization.
2.4 Limitations
Our “bird’s eye view” has obvious blind spots:
• We can only study licensed links — if a network uses unlicensed
spectrum, it is opaque to our methodology. This is unlikely on
the congested Chicago–NJ corridor.
• We can only inspect the microwave segments, not the latencies
within clusters at the data centers. In most of these data centers,
however, traders can connect to any of the networks, thus mak-
ing the microwave segments the main determinant of latency
differences.
• We can only comment on latency estimates from path distances:
a network with superior radio equipment on its towers (in terms
of lower latency for signal repetition or regeneration), or using
fewer towers, may still beat a shorter-path competitor.
• If a network has multiple entities filing on its behalf, it will
appear as two separate networks in our analysis. Future work
could potentially overcome this by either identifying the net-
works behind the filing entities (§2.2), or (with some uncertainty)
by evaluating which networks have complementary links that
together form end-end paths.
3 STATE OF THE RACE
Of the 29 licensees we shortlisted in §2, not all have an end-to-end
network between CME and the NJ data centers at present. At any
given time, different companies are in various states of setting up
or bringing down their networks. We found 9 connected networks
between CME and Equinix NY4, as of 1st April, 2020, which are
listed in Table. 1. (We shall explain and discuss “APA” later, in §5.)
As Table. 2 shows, New Line Networks (NLN) [37] has the
shortest-path network between CME in Chicago and all 3 NJ data

centers as of 1st April 2020. Between CME and Equinix NY4, NLN
provides an end-end path latency of 3.96171 ms, less than Pierce
Broadband (PB) by ∼0.4µs. Along CME-NYSE and CME-NASDAQ,
NLN has an edge of ∼8.1µs and ∼0.8µs respectively.
The per-tower overheads not accounted for in our study could
change the rankings in some cases. For instance, Jefferson Mi-
crowave (JM) has the fewest towers (22) along the shortest path
between CME and NY4. If both NLN and JM were using the same
radios, and the per-tower added latency was higher than 1.4µs,
JM would offer lower end-end latency. Of course, differences in
radio technology across networks would have an impact as well.
Our analysis thus only compares networks in terms of one (highly
competitive) metric: path distance based on acquired tower sites.
4 LATENCY EVOLUTION OVER TIME
Competing for a latency edge, HFT networks work to find, buy,
and build the most suitable towers near the data centers and along
geodesics between them. If a network procures better tower sites
over time, its latency decreases.
Fig. 1 shows the latency evolution since 2013 of some of the
fastest networks for the CME–Equinix-NY4 path, including the
presently (2020) fastest ones from Table 2. The smallest end-to-
end latency on this path has decreased from 4.00 ms in 2013 to
3.962 ms in 2020. National Tower Company’s network ceased to
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
Debopam Bhattacherjee et al.
shows, among the 4 active networks, it has the smallest number of
active licenses by far.
Nevertheless, each network’s latency and licensing trajectories
show the expected correlation. For instance, NLN was granted 55
new licenses in 2015, resulting in 95 active licenses as on 1st January,
2016. This is reflected in Fig. 1, with NLN having achieved end-to-
end connectivity as of 1st January, 2016. Further augmentation of
NLN’s network is reflected in the persistently high licensing rate
in 2016 and 2017, which gave NLN the shortest path between CME
and Equinix NY4 by 2018. These network augmentations are also
clearly seen when visually comparing NLN’s network in 2016 to
their current network (Fig. 3 top and bottom). Over the years, NLN
has added significantly more towers with multiple possible physical
paths to increase redundancy in the network.
Fig. 3 shows some links that are either disconnected from the rest
of the network (e.g., the single MW link in the center-South of the
visualizations) or form a significant detour from the lowest-latency
route (e.g., bottom-right; close to Sunbury, Pennsylvania). Such
links can be attributed to various factors, including the following:
(a) a part of the network may be hidden under FCC filings by a
different company; (b) such links provide some targeted service
in that specific area; and (c) they form part of a future, under-
construction route.
5 NETWORK PROPERTIES DIFFER
Although Webline Holdings has a network that has been consis-
tently among the fastest 5 networks in the Chicago–NJ corridor
for all 3 paths (CME - NY4, CME - NYSE, and CME - NASDAQ), it
has a lag of 10µs, 117µs, and 0.8µs compared to the fastest network
(NLN) respectively. In this fierce competition, where each microsec-
ond matters, and slower networks, like National Tower Company,
perish over time, how do networks like Webline Holdings manage
to survive?
While one might argue that this network is only optimized for
NASDAQ (see Table. 2), clearly it has tower presence close to all 3
NJ data centers, as is evident from the underlying data. Answering
this question without an industry insider perspective necessarily
involves some degree of speculation, but our analysis suggests that
the answer lies in network reliability: one network may be able to
dominate another in fair weather, when all radio links are active,
but a more reliable network may be faster at other times.
Attenuation in microwave radio (MW) communications is well
understood [40, 41]: longer tower-to-tower links and bad weather
conditions increase data loss, and higher frequencies are more
susceptible to weather disruptions. Naturally, using more alternate
paths, shorter links, and lower frequencies improves reliability. We
thus evaluate networks along these metrics as well, focusing in
particular on Webline Holdings (WH) and New Line Networks
(NLN).
Alternate path availability: For each network, we find the frac-
tion of links that can be removed such that the latency of the
remaining network is not more than 5% greater than the c-speed
latency along the geodesic. This fraction is referred to as the alter-
nate path availability or APA. APA is only one of many possible
metrics for redundancy in a network; we adapted this metric from
prior work on low-latency ISP networks [27].
Figure 1: Evolution of end-to-end latency over last 8 years between CME
and Equinix NY4; points are plotted for January 1st of each year, except 2020,
for which we plot points for April 1st. The y-axis deliberately starts from a
non-zero point to highlight the seemingly small but extremely consequential
differences. Note: Pierce Broadband only achieved end-end connectivity recently
and is seen only in 2020.

exist in 2018, while Pierce Broadband, the second fastest now, came
into existence only in 2020, thus showing how this ecosystem is
continuously evolving. This is at least somewhat surprising: the
end-points of this path are fixed so there is a minimum-possible
latency bound, and yet, over 8 years, while fierce competition has
been driving latencies ever lower, the minimum achievable latency
of 3.955 ms has not been reached.
Fig. 2 shows a complementary view of this evolution, using the
number of active licenses for the same 5 companies. National Tower
Company illustrates a full arc from ramping up to closing down.
The company aggressively acquired licenses in 2013 to build an
end-end CME-NY4 path, which it further shortened with more
licensing and expansion through 2014 and 2015. The increase in
active licenses over 2014 is small, but the underlying data show both
new grants and cancellations, indicating that the company gave up
some tower sites as it acquired more suitable ones. It cancelled 71
licenses in 2017 and 2018, thereby vanishing from the ecosystem.
A higher raw number of licenses does not necessarily imply
one network has shorter paths than another — strategically placed
towers are more essential to that objective. For instance, Pierce
Broadband has nearly the shortest path per Fig. 1, but as Fig. 2
