User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Are spurious TCP connections on port 53 a problem? I run a server which amongst other things uses tinydns for DNS and axfrdns for handling transfer requests from our secondary DNS (another system).
I understand that tinydns uses port 53 on UDP and axfrdns uses port 53 on TCP.

I've configured axfrdns to only allow connections from my agreed secondary host.
I run logcheck to monitor my logs and every day I see spurious connections on port 53 (TCP) from seemingly random hosts.  They usually turn out to be from ADSL connections.

My question is; are these innocent requests or a security risk?
I am happy to block repeat offenders using iptables but don't want to block innocent users of one of the websites I host.

Thanks, Darren.

Assistant: TCP is not only used for zone transfers.

TCP is the default fallback used by DNS clients should your DNS server ever send back a truncated (TC=1) UDP response.  This would happen if you are serving any data that exceeds 512 bytes in a single packet.

If you're running a DNS server then it should accept TCP connections from DNS clients, and there's no inherent security risk in doing so.  There's a very slight risk of DoS attacks against the DNS server, but that's true of any public facing service.

See draft-ietf-dnsext-dns-tcp-requirements which should be published as an RFC within the next month.

See RFC 5966 for more details.

Ob disclaimer - I wrote that RFC.
