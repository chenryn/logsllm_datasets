of ‘unrelated’ individuals and comparing it to their trait similarity (h2SNP) To elucidate the genomic architecture of blood metabolites, 
we simultaneously estimated total heritability (h2total), SNP heritability (h2SNP) and the proportion of heritability captured by known 
metabolite loci (h2GW-loci) We reviewed all association studies of SNPs and blood metabolites, retrieving 241,965 associations for 
which all associated metabolites were classified For the estimation of h2GW-loci  we aggregated > 800 class-specific metabolite loci 
for 309 lipids and 52 organic acids This revealed significant differences in h2SNP and h2GW-loci among different classes of lipids and 
organic acids Phosphatidylcholines with a higher degree of unsaturation had higher h2GW-loci estimates
This study highlights the genetic architecture of metabolite classes and lipid species, with  genes explaining on average 50% of 
variation in metabolites, and common genetic variants influencing metabolites This knowledge can be used in construction of 
polygenic scores and causal modeling

The future for food may be in our past: the importance of plants in our diets. 
Wednesday, June 26, 8:30 a.m. – 9:30 a.m.
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Cathie Martin, John Innes Centre, Colney Research Park, UK
The appreciation of the challenges of achieving global food security has matured to include nutritional security, as scientists have 
realised that not only calorie content but food and colonic microbial composition impact our health and well-being, dramatically The 
ways that the nutrients we consume affect our health are highly complex due to the diversity of what we eat, the varying digestibility 
of what we eat, the changing composition and functioning of each individual’s gut microbiota, the differences in absorption and 
bioavailability of the nutrients we eat, the differences in responses between individuals to what they eat and the multi-fold mechanisms 
of action that nutrients have on our health It has been accepted for more than 50 years that diets rich in plants, particularly fruit and 
vegetables, protect health, and yet diets have declined, with lower fruit and vegetable content replaced by more cheap, sugary, oily 
processed foods These dietary shifts have had a marked impact on the incidence of chronic diseases; obesity, metabolic diseases, 
type2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases 
Only by understanding how phytonutrients improve our health by reducing risks of chronic disease and which phytonutrients confer 
greatest benefits in protecting against specific diseases (a process termed comparative nutrition) can we hope to achieve dietary 
improvements at all levels in society By describing examples of preclinical comparative nutritional analyses, I hope to illustrate the 
potential of dietary improvement using plant-based foods to improve our health and quality of life and to reduce the economic burden 
on our health-care systems

Comprehensive investigations of cancer cell metabolism using 13C-fluxomics
Thursday, June 27, 1:30 p.m. – 2:30 p.m.
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jean-Charles Portais, University Toulouse, France
Metabolism is a basic cellular function that sustains survival, growth and adaptation of living organisms At the cellular level, 
metabolism is organized as a network, ie a complex set of biochemical reactions that are tightly interconnected To investigate such 
complex systems, powerful tools are required, and a broad range of approaches (metabolomics, fluxomics) have been developed 
over the past decade to provide detailed and quantitative measurement of the operation of metabolic networks These methods can 
be combined with other omics tools (eg transcriptomics, proteomics, etc) and to metabolic modelling to provide systems biology 
approaches for in-depth, comprehensive understanding of the organization, functioning and adaptation of cellular metabolism 
This understanding can provide the rationale for efficient and cost-effective optimization of production systems (knowledge-based 
metabolic optimization) in biotechnology, or to characterize the metabolic dysfunctions associated with pathologies, or to identify 
and validate new therapeutic targets or strategies In this lecture, particular emphasis will be made on 13C-fluxomics, with selected 
illustrations in the field of cancer metabolism, and how this can help in designing improved therapeutical strategies

Translating metabolomics from academic science into regulatory practice:  
challenges and progress in pharmacology and toxicology 
Wednesday, June 26 
|  1:30 p.m. – 3:15 p.m.
While metabolomics has become a mature and widely used technology in academic research, its application to regulatory science has been limited 
to date. Several factors contribute to this slow uptake, the most commonly cited roadblocks are the lack of standardisation, validation and reporting 
formats for metabolomics. Recently, progress has been made in translating ‘omics technologies (including metabolomics) from academic science 
towards regulatory practice in the fields of pharmacology and toxicology, specifically for drug and chemical safety, respectively. This timely session at 
Metabolomics-2019 will introduce and review some of the opportunities, challenges and recent progress in this translational activity. While focused on 
drug and chemical safety legislation in Europe, the progress reported will have much wider implications for metabolomics in international regulatory 
practice. Talks will be presented by regulators, industry and academic scientists to provide a balanced perspective, and include a panel discussion 
chaired by Dr. Pim Leonards (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam).
An Overview of the 21st Century Cures Act: Opportunities for Biomarkers and Precision Medicine
Dr. Rick Beger, National Center for Toxicological Research, US FDA, United States
A biomarker is defined as a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an 
exposure, or therapeutic intervention There are seven BEST biomarker categories; diagnostic, monitoring, pharmacodynamic response, predictive, 
prognostic, safety, and susceptibility/risk The 21st Century Cures Act establishes a biomarker “qualification” process for drug development tools that 
can then be used for particular context of use (COU) in a regulatory submission The submission of a biomarker for regulatory use under the 21st Century 
Cures Act, is a three-stage submission process and builds on the existing biomarker submission process The first Stage is a letter of intent (LOI), that 
includes the drug development need the biomarker is intended to address, biomarker information The intended context of use (COU), and information on 
how the biomarker will be measured If the FDA accepts the LOI, a qualification plan (QP) describing the information including the analytical method and 
performance characteristics that will qualify the biomarker for the proposed COU in drug development is submitted The third step is a full qualification 
package (FQP) that contains all accumulated information on the biomarker, organized by topic area The FDA will make a final decision about whether the 
biomarker is qualified based on the FQP The 21st Century Cures Act and metabolomics ability to capture phenotype information on a patient provides 
opportunities and for biomarkers and precision medicine Examples of potential metabolomics biomarkers will be provided
Big Data “Omics” – Challenges and Opportunities in Regulation
Dr. Renate König, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines, Germany
A new Joint HMA/EMA Task Force was established, initiated by EU Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA) in collaboration with the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA), to explore how medicines regulators can use Big Data to support research, innovation and robust medicines development to benefit 
human health
This talk will focus on the identification of the emerging challenges from the use of Big Data, with the focus on Bioanalytical Omics, to prepare the 
European regulatory system for the future, on establishing recommendations for use of “Omics” big data in assessment of medicines as well highlight 
the opportunities for “Omics” in the regulation of medicines
Various Applications of Metabolomics in Toxicology
Prof Hennicke Kamp, BASF, Germany
BASF and its daughter company metanomics established the database MetaMap®Tox containing the plasma metabolome of more than 1000 
compounds derived from 28-day studies in rats Approximately 250 different endogenous metabolites are measured and more than 100 patterns 
for different toxicological modes of action are available MetaMap®Tox is nowadays routinely used at BASF to support systemic toxicity testing in 
terms of identification of target organs and modes of action or for read-across applications (Kamp at al, 2012; van Ravenzwaay et al, 2016) Over the 
last years, we have broadened this approach to identify maternal toxicity in reproductive toxicity studies (Keller et al, 2018) Additionally, a highly 
stable and reproducible liver in vitro model was established, in which the intracellular metabolome of HepG2 cells can be specifically altered through 
treatment with different hepatotoxicants (Ramirez et al, 2017) So far more than 90 different treatments have been analysed with this setup In this 
presentation, examples will be shown how metabolomics can be used for the purposes mentioned above Since the acceptance of such approaches in 
the regulatory community is somehow limited, also concepts for increasing regulatory acceptance will be discussed

Best Practice Guidelines and Reporting Standards for Applications of Metabolomics in Regulatory 
Toxicology: the International MERIT Project
Prof. Mark Viant, University of Birmingham, UK
During the last two decades metabolomics has become a very widely used technology in academic research, yet its application to regulatory science, 
including regulatory toxicology, has been limited While several factors contribute to this slow translation into regulatory practice, the most commonly 
cited roadblock by chemical regulators, government and industry scientists is the lack of standardisation, best practice guidelines and data and 
metadata reporting formats Here we will describe the final report of the MEtabolomics standaRds Initiative in Toxicology (MERIT) project, which 
brought together a team of international experts from multiple sectors to address this need MERIT sought to define best practice guidelines and 
minimal reporting standards for designing, undertaking, reporting and assessing the quality of both untargeted metabolomics and targeted metabolite 
analyses in the context of regulatory toxicology To provide context, the most relevant use cases for metabolomics in toxicology were also identified, 
including for example chemical grouping based upon metabolic phenotypes The MERIT guidelines included experimental design; QA/QC; sampling 
and extraction; data acquisition and processing of mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy assays; data processing and statistical analysis; and 
metabolite identification A strategy and architecture for integrated data management, sharing and exploitation in regulatory toxicology was also 
developed We concluded that most steps in the application of untargeted metabolomics and targeted metabolite assays to regulatory toxicology are 
well established, including significant recent progress in QA/QC We recommend that the MERIT minimal reporting standards and data management 
strategy are tested as multi-stakeholder use cases

Metabolomics Applications for Oncology and Immunology in Drug Discovery
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Thomas Roddy, Agios Pharmaceuticals, United States
Metabolomics data from in vitro and in vivo studies is more comprehensive and in depth than ever Large data sets from metabolomics and flux studies 
are often daunting to analyze and interpret, especially when projects move quickly A major focus of our lab has been in developing workflows and data 
analytics to allow rapid turnaround of data and fast iteration of biological experiments Our goal is to quickly learn from one experiment, to design the 
next, and to iterate this process in a way that effectively impacts our projects, allowing us to identify novel biological mechanisms and pharmacodynamic 
biomarkers for our oncology and rare genetic disease programs In this presentation, I will briefly discuss our multidisciplinary MS lab (metabolomics, 
lipidomics, fluxomics, and proteomics) and data systems I will also present examples when metabolomics gave us unique insights into biological 
processes, including the development of a pharmacodynamic marker for a cholesterol pathway oncology target, an analysis of the tumor microenvironment 
across several models, and the modulation of metabolism in immunological models (in vitro and in vivo)

Multi-omic discovery of metabolic rewiring in triple-negative breast cancer following mitochondrial folate 
transport ablation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Steven Gross, Weill Cornell Medicine, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Qiuying Chen, Joshua B. Zuk, Chris A. Miller, Steve M. Fischer, Steven S. Gross
Mitochondrial tetrahydrofolate (THF)-mediated reactions provide one-carbon units for synthesis of purines, thymidine, and methylation of DNA, 
RNA, proteins, and lipids Inhibition of THF-mediated reactions (ie, antifolates) have been a staple of cancer chemotherapy, including triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) The present study sought to broadly discover how TNBC cells retaliate to knockout of the mitochondrial THF transporter (MFT/
slc25a32), and consequent loss of mitochondria-dependent one-carbon trafficking reactions Using untargeted metabolomics, discovery proteomics 
and untargeted stable isotope tracing strategy, we discover that mitochondria folate transporter (slc25a32) gene deletion in TNBC cells elicits a profound 
rewiring of glucose to polyol pathway, concomitant with delayed cell cycle and a 6-10-fold increase in several aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) - enzymes 
that consume NADPH to facilitate cytosolic one carbon reaction that generates NADPH Activation of polyol pathway and switch of serine-derived one 
carbon metabolism from mitochondria to cytosol were similarly observed in methotrexate treated TNBC cells Our findings nominate these upregulated 
AKR enzymes as chemotherapeutic targets, for inhibition in combination with antifolate drugs Additionally, multi-omics studies revealed that loss of 
slc25a32 increases TNBC cell dependence on purine salvage, and TGF-β signaling with evidence of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (ie, increased 
cell migration/invasion) Dependence of upregulated polyol pathway, purine salvage, cytosolic one carbon reaction and TGF-β signaling was supported 
by downregulation in slc25a32 protein-restored KO cells Taken together, multi-omic findings provide unexpected insights into how TNBC cells adapt to 
disabled mitochondrial folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for combined intervention with antifolate drugs
