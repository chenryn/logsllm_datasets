#### Challenge Name

#### Issue Description
I have noticed that each time I move onto a new challenge the old code still
displays on the iPhone screen even thought the code in the text editor is
completely new. For instance, if my previous challenge displays a blue box on
the iPhone, but my new challenge starts off with code for a red triangle (or
something), the iPhone still displays the blue box. I think this may be as
simple as refreshing the iPhone result screen each time a new challenge is
loaded.
