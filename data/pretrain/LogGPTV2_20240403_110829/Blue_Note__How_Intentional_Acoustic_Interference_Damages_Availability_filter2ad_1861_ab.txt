IV. CAUSATION I: HEAD AND DISK DISPLACEMENT
Prior work reports that audible acoustic waves cause
throughput loss [2], [3], [4], [6]. Yet, little is known on the
root cause. To investigate, we use a Finite Element Model and
Fig. 4.

interference. For mechanically coupled tests, the device containing both the
HDD and speaker (such as a laptop) lay directly inside the chamber.
of a track and (2) a feedforward controller where a shock
sensor adjusts the head in anticipation of vibration. The HDD
will park its head away from the track when the shock sensor
senses extreme vibration, such as when a laptop falls.
Acoustic Waves. Acoustic waves vary in amplitude and
frequency. Humans can hear acoustic waves between 20 Hz
to 20 KHz. Ultrasonic waves have frequencies above 20 KHz,
and are inaudible. When acoustic waves contact mechanical
components, a vibrational force acts on those materials at the
frequency of the wave, with a force proportional to the wave’s
amplitude. In addition, mechanical components have resonant
frequencies, at which vibrational forces have an ampliﬁed effect.
Acoustic resonance can induce large vibrations in HDDs, and
in turn cause loss of throughput [2], [3], [4], [5].
III. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
There are three operational challenges to quantify the effects
of acoustic interference on hard disk drives: (1) isolating the
experiment from uncontrolled signals, (2) inducing precise
vibration at the HDD, and (3) accurately measuring HDD
errors due to acoustic interference. Unless noted otherwise,
the experiments in this paper shared the same physical setup
described in this section. Note that a setup with this level of
precision is only needed for scientiﬁc measurement to discover
causality, but an attacker could use a simpler setup to cause
the deleterious effects.
A. Isolating the Experiment
The setup must prevent environmental factors from sig-
niﬁcantly altering the results of the experiment. In our setup,
the HDD lies in an acoustic isolation chamber, as shown in
Figure 4, to prevent unintended noise from altering results.
The setup also monitors the drive’s temperature using SMART
data to ensure the temperature stays within operational limits
(below 50 ◦C [11]). The speaker hangs from the ceiling to
mechanically uncouple it from the HDD in all tests.
B. Generating Vibration
Accurately generating vibration is crucial in observing the
effectiveness of this attack. Audible and ultrasonic frequencies
use the same basic setup (Figure 4).
Audible Frequencies. Our setup generates audible fre-
quencies using a Tektronix AFG3251 function generator, a

frequencies it is far easier to block writes than reads because reads have a
higher tolerance for error.
or disk sufﬁciently to hinder typical write throughput, but not
strong enough to completely block the drive from reading or
writing to disk. Figure 1 shows this behavior as the lower
amplitude signal vibrates the read/write head enough to hinder
operation, but not enough to completely block reads and writes.
Then, when the amplitude of the signal increases, the vibration
of the read/write head also increases, leading to the drive being
unable to read or write.
Reads Require Higher Amplitudes to Block. Another
quality of throughput loss via head stack assembly vibration
is that read blocking generally requires greater amplitudes
than write blocking, shown in Figure 6b. This is because the
operational margin of error is greater for reads than for writes.
Thus, the head may vibrate within the read error margin but
outside the write error margin.
V. CAUSATION II: SENSOR SPOOFING
Attackers can use sound waves or vibration to exploit
the piezo shock sensors or MEMS capacitive accelerometers
common in most modern HDDs, inducing a complete loss in
capability to read or write to disk. These shock sensors and
accelerometers detect sudden disturbances (e.g., dropping the
HDD) such that the HDD can park its head to prevent damage.
Accelerometers were shown to be vulnerable to malicious sound
waves and vibration [8]. In this paper, we examined piezo
shock sensors, and found acoustic waves (primarily inaudible
ultrasonic waves) can alter sensor outputs. We analyze how
ultrasound tricks the HDD into inadvertently parking its head,
rendering the drive unable to read or write to disk.
Fig. 5. COMSOL simulation showing displacement of a HDD head assembly
and disk during 5 KHz acoustic signal attack (left: top view; bottom right:
lateral cross-section; top right: R/W head displacement). Note the displacement
on the disk surface (∼156 nm of maximum vertical displacement across
the central tracks), and the maximum horizontal displacement of the head
suspension (∼8 nm, rectangle box). This exceeds the 7.5 nm read and 5 nm
write fault thresholds, assuming a 50 nm width.
numerous experiments to analyze how acoustic waves (and thus
vibrations) displace the read/write head or disk platter outside
of operational bounds, resulting in either partial throughput
loss or complete loss of throughput (Figure 1).
A. Vulnerable Hard Disk Drive Mechanics
We use a Finite Element Model to explore the vibroacoustic
response of the HDD’s individual mechanical parts (a common
use for Finite Element Models [12], [13]). We investigate
how sufﬁciently powerful acoustic waves and vibration lead to
throughput loss. Our speciﬁc model, made using COMSOL,
uses common manufacturer materials and parameters [14].
Figure 5, generated using our model, shows how acoustic
waves can displace a read/write head or disk platter outside of
operational bounds, inducing throughput loss. This model is
simulating a 5 kHz acoustic wave striking the HDD chassis
from above at 120 dB SPL. The model estimates maximum disk
displacement of about 33 nm horizontally and 156 nm vertically,
while estimating maximum read/write head displacement of
9 nm horizontally and 112 nm vertically.
Given a track width of 50 nm [15], a 10% track width
margin (i.e. a 5 nm margin) of error for writes and 15% margin
for reads (i.e. a 7.5 nm margin) [10], and a vertical distance of
6 nm between the head and the disk [16], these displacements
push the drive outside of its operational bounds for reading
and writing. In addition, these numbers show the possibility of
the read/write head crashing into the disk.
More details on this ﬁnite element model simulation appear
in the appendix.
B. Mechanical Throughput Loss Observations
Using the setup described in Section III, we gathered data
to show the two main qualities of throughput loss induced by
head stack assembly and disk vibration: non-binary throughput
loss and reads being signiﬁcantly harder to block than writes.
Non-Binary Throughput Loss. One critical quality of
throughput loss due to head stack assembly vibration is that
it allows for partial throughput loss as shown in Figure 6a.
A signal can be strong enough to vibrate the read/write head
