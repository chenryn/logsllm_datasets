**Description:**
The `lodctr` command is used to register or save performance counter names and their associated registry settings in a file. It also allows you to designate trusted services.

**Syntax:**
```shell
lodctr [/s:<file>] [/r[:<file>]] [/t:<service>] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/s:** `<file>`
  - Specifies the name of the file where the performance counter registry settings and explanatory text will be saved.
  
- **/r** or **/r:** `<file>`
  - Restores the performance counter registry settings and explanatory text from the current registry settings and cached performance files related to the registry. If `/r:` is followed by a file name, it restores the settings from the specified file.
  - **Warning:** Using this command will overwrite all existing performance counter registry settings and explanatory text with the configuration defined in the specified file.
  
- **/t:** `<service>`
  - Indicates that the specified service is trusted.
  
- **/?**
  - Displays help information for the `lodctr` command at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- When using the `/r` or `/r:` parameter, ensure that the specified file contains the correct and complete performance counter settings, as it will replace the existing settings in the registry.

**Examples:**

- To save the current performance counter registry settings and explanatory text to a file named "perf_backup1.txt", use the following command:
  ```shell
  lodctr /s:"perf_backup1.txt"
  ```

- To restore the performance counter registry settings and explanatory text from a file named "perf_restore.txt", use the following command:
  ```shell
  lodctr /r:"perf_restore.txt"
  ```

- To indicate that a service named "MyService" is trusted, use the following command:
  ```shell
  lodctr /t:"MyService"
  ```

By using these commands, you can manage and maintain the performance counter settings on your Windows Server system effectively.
