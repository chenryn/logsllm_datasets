Question: In the context of hardware security, an engineer argues that permanently disabling test or debug modes in hardware during runtime operations can prevent potential security breaches. Which of the following would be a valid counterargument to this claim?
"A": "Permanently disabling test or debug modes could impede necessary maintenance and real-time troubleshooting.",
"B": "Permanent activation of test or debug modes ensures a continuous check on the system's integrity and security.",
"C": "Test or debug modes are essential for the hardware to perform optimally and should remain active.",
"D": "Permanently disabling test or debug modes would have no impact on security since hardware is inherently secure."
Answer: A
