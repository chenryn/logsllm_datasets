Reduce User Onboarding Barrier. The smart home control
interface still needs to be made more accessible to users.
Even by our best efforts, a mobile app was too much to ask
for some participants to install without our direct assistance
and urging. If a smart home control system provides perfect
security and privacy features that are locked up in an app
that not all household members install, the beneﬁts of these
features will be limited. And in worst-case scenarios, if a
household members cannot gain access to the smart home, it
can enable domestic abuse by those with control. We suggest
several potential approaches to address this issue:
One approach is to lower the installation barrier by mak-
ing a mobile web version of control interfaces. In our experi-
ence, Web APIs were sufﬁcient for all functionality, except for
Bluetooth beacon scanning for proximity sensing — though
browsers intend to implement this feature in the future [7].
Another approach is to further simplify user authentication.
Our prototype required only a QR code rather than a user-
name/password for subsequent users. We suggest exploring
even more radical approaches, such as not requiring any tra-
ditional authentication to use the smart home, and instead
granting basic smart device control functions to anyone in
physical proximity (just as someone with physical access to a
manual light switch can toggle it).
7.4 Directions for Future Research
Our work also suggests research questions that we encourage
future work to investigate:
Study and Design for Positive Household Norms. We ob-
served in our study that in cooperative households, social
norms were effective at mitigating multi-user security and
privacy issues, sometimes more so than the features we im-
plemented in our prototype. Rather than trying to provide
features that play the same role as these social norms, like
location-based access controls for preventing inconsiderate
use of remote access, we suggest (1) studying households
that exhibit positive social norms around smart home usage
and (2) designing and evaluating smart home systems that
encourage the development of these norms in generally co-
operative households. Based on the results of our study, we
propose a few design “nudges” that could potentially instill
better behaviors in smart home users.
First, rather than asking users to design access control poli-
cies around considerate usage, smart home platforms could
automatically detect commands that are potential norm vi-
olations, and then ask the user “Are you sure?”, including
a reason for why the command might violate a norm. For
example, this prompt could be triggered when attempting to
control devices in another user’s private bedroom, or when
remotely controlling devices that would impact other people
physically present. Such a prompt could encourage users to
think twice about disturbing others, while still allowing for
seamless access if necessary.
Another type of nudge could promote user agency: during
the setup of a smart home, the app could encourage the person
installing the smart home to involve other occupants in the
setup process, including encouraging and even guiding the
setup of additional accounts and conversations about the dif-
ferent devices, automations, and policies that should be part of
the new smart home. How to best design such a conversational
guide is an interesting question for future work.
Nudges could also be designed to “scold” users for exces-
sive trolling or other playful behavior, like rapidly ﬂicking
lights on and off. While it might be good to allow playful
experimentation when the smart home is set up initially, even-
tually the app could rate limit these behaviors, or display a
dialogue box encouraging the user to stop.
While norm-based nudges would of course not protect
against users with malicious intent, our study results suggest
that promoting positive norms could help reduce friction in
the case of generally cooperative households, where conﬂicts
and tension may arise from unfamiliarity with how one’s ac-
tions affect others in the smart home. Next, we discuss the
challenge of designing smart homes for adversarial settings.
Investigate Designs for Adversarial Situations. Smart
homes can enable or amplify harms in adversarial living
situations, like in households where domestic abuse is oc-
curing, or in homes with Airbnb-style rentals. While some
of the design principles we proposed could mitigate some
of these harms, such as using notiﬁcations to provide more
transparency about how surveillance cameras are being used,
our prototype would not provide adequate protections against
other harmful actions, such as a malicious admin abusing
their privileges to deny victims control of the home, or over-
riding protections against remote harassment that location or
role-based access controls could provide. This is a very chal-
lenging problem, because some of these security and privacy
features are inherently dual use: for example, admin roles and
access controls may desirable for parents to prevent children
from doing harmful things, but could be used by abusers to
exercise power over their victims. A critical but challenging
design question for future work is how to design smart home
access controls and monitoring that both protects users from
abuse, but still enables benign use cases.
Study Transparency Features for Privacy-Sensitive De-
vices. As discussed above, a limitation of our prototype was
that we could not provide activity notiﬁcations for privacy
USENIX Association
28th USENIX Security Symposium    171
sensitive smart home devices like voice assistants and secu-
rity cameras, because of the limitations of the SmartThings
API. We suspect that surfacing information about when audio
and video is being recorded or viewed could change users’
perceptions of the privacy risks of these devices, and could
help people identify when their privacy is being violated. We
propose an in situ evaluation of user reactions to a smart home
system that notiﬁes people if they are being recorded, or if
another user views or listens to a log that they are present in.
Audio/video recording notiﬁcations could also be surfaced
not just in the smart home, but at a global level with coopera-
tion from mobile operating systems and device manufactur-
ers. Cameras and microphones could emit Bluetooth beacon
signals when they are active, so that users could receive notiﬁ-
cations whenever they are nearby an active recording device.
Study Natural Language-based Access Control Policy
Creation for Smart Homes. During our interviews, we ob-
served that our participants were able to clearly convey their
access control preferences and hypothetical policies verbally.
Given that these policies are easily comprehensible in natu-
ral language, a possible way to simplify conﬁguration is to
allow users to craft policies using a natural language inter-
face, rather than menus with drop-down lists and checkboxes.
While prior work has found that direct conversion from natu-
ral language to policy is possible but imprecise [20, 31, 32],
controlled natural language policy creation could be used to
constrain the space of usable words and sentence structures.
Using a controlled natural language approach, a possible inter-
face could be an autocomplete-style input, which guides users
through picking access control mechanisms, possible devices,
users, roles, and other conditions. While this approach was
found to be relatively usable in a systems administration con-
text [17, 30], future work should evaluate whether it is usable
for typical end users in a smart home setting.
Further Study of Automations and Attributions. We were
not able to fully study whether notiﬁcations could help users
with debugging automations, or attributing issues caused by
automations and third-party apps, because of technical limi-
tations of our prototype (speciﬁcally, that SmartThings does
not surface to third-party applications the provenance of pro-
grammatic smart device actuations). Other researchers have
proposed ways of preventing buggy or malicious behavior by
third-party smart home integrations, such as detecting prove-
nance [37] or contextual permission prompts for third-party
apps [19]. These research contributions are technically valu-
able but their usability and utility have not been tested with
real end users; we suggest that future work do so.
7.5 Limitations
Though an in-home user study allowed us to study how people
used our prototype under realistic circumstances, this study
design nevertheless comes with several limitations.
Most importantly, as discussed already, our prototype and
user study focused on generally cooperative households,
rather than households with adversarial relationships. Since
we required consent from all participating household mem-
bers, our sample is skewed towards households with sufﬁ-
ciently functional interpersonal relationships to agree to par-
ticipate together in the study. Thus, we were unable to evaluate
how our prototype would perform in an adversarial setting,
nor did we gain insight into how to design for those settings.
Moreover, our protocol design involved conducting inter-
views with participants in a group setting, with the entire
household. It is possible that participants were unwilling to re-
veal multi-user conﬂicts and privacy issues, because it would
also reveal these problems to other household members.
Additionally, the devices our participants chose were gen-
erally not among the most invasive. This was due both to
technical limitations (e.g., our prototype could not integrate
with most security cameras using the SmartThings API), and
because we gave participants the freedom to choose devices
they were comfortable with. While our prototype did not in-
terface with these more privacy sensitive devices, we still
learned from participants via hypotheticals about access con-
trol grounded in their concrete experiences with our prototype
and their past experiences with those devices. Future work
should further consider multi-user smart home design in the
face of more invasive devices.
Finally, the complexity and cost of an in-home study limited
the feasible number of participating households, preventing us
from drawing any quantitative conclusions from our results.
Despite these limitations, we believe our study provides
valuable insights into how to design multi-user smart home se-
curity/privacy features for many (though not all) households.
8 Additional Related Work
Methodologically, our paper drew on a number of other in-
home studies of smart homes, from HCI and ubiquitous com-
puting. Most closely related to our work were the design
and evaluation of a calendar-based interface for smart home
control [26], and of a smart home data visualization dash-
board [5]. Other in-home studies in HCI have studied how
users interact with commercial smart homes in practice, like
general usage patterns and usability [4, 18, 25], setup and con-
ﬁguration [9], and end user programming [39]. Researchers
have also studied how users perceive and use privacy sensitive
devices like cameras and voice assistants, both in-situ [28,40],
and in interviews or surveys with broader populations [21,42].
In terms of the security and privacy of smart home devices
and platforms, researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in
the underlying protocols and technologies (e.g., [2,15,29,38])
and studied the spread and behavior of the Mirai botnet that
targeted IoT devices [1]. Other work has analyzed security
and privacy weaknesses in smart home platforms that sup-
port third-party apps like SmartThings [11]. To address the

risks posed by apps, researchers have proposed and evaluated
various defenses, including modiﬁcations to trigger-action
programming platforms to limit misuse of access tokens [13],
restricting apps using ﬂow control [12], using provenance de-
tection to identify anomalies [37], and a contextual access con-
trol system to protect against malicious third-party apps [19].
9 Conclusion
Multi-user smart homes face unique security and privacy chal-
lenges, such as supporting a wide range of access control
preferences, and managing tensions and conﬂicts between
users. Finding the design of current smart home systems to be
insufﬁcient for addressing these challenges, and recognizing
the gap in knowledge around what designs can meaningfully
improve end user experiences, we conducted an in-home user
study to investigate possible approaches and solutions. Focus-
ing on generally cooperative (rather than explicitly adversar-
ial) households, we designed a smart home control interface
based on design principles of access control ﬂexibility, user
agency, respect among users, and transparency of smart home
behaviors. We deployed our prototype in seven households in
a month-long study to evaluate our proposed design principles,
and to improve our understanding of how users interact with
security and privacy features in practice. Based on the ﬁnd-
ings of our user study, we provide design recommendations
and identify open challenges for future research. Among our
recommendations, we suggest that researchers improve the
usability of smart home access controls by developing more
usable conﬁguration interfaces (such as natural language pol-
icy creation), and design smart home platforms that reduce
tensions and conﬂicts by leveraging and scaffolding positive
household norms.
