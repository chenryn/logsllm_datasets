### Reducing User Onboarding Barriers in Smart Home Control

The current smart home control interfaces still need to be made more accessible to users. Despite our best efforts, some participants found it challenging to install a mobile app without direct assistance and encouragement. If a smart home control system offers robust security and privacy features but these are confined to an app that not all household members install, the benefits of these features will be limited. In the worst-case scenarios, if a household member cannot access the smart home, it can enable domestic abuse by those with control.

To address this issue, we suggest several potential approaches:

1. **Lower Installation Barrier:**
   - Develop a mobile web version of the control interface. Our experience shows that Web APIs can support most functionalities, except for Bluetooth beacon scanning for proximity sensing. However, browsers plan to implement this feature in the future [7].

2. **Simplify User Authentication:**
   - Our prototype required only a QR code for subsequent users, eliminating the need for usernames and passwords. We suggest exploring even more radical approaches, such as not requiring any traditional authentication. Instead, basic smart device control functions could be granted to anyone in physical proximity, similar to how someone with physical access to a manual light switch can toggle it.

### Directions for Future Research

Our work also suggests several research questions for future investigation:

#### Study and Design for Positive Household Norms
In cooperative households, social norms were effective at mitigating multi-user security and privacy issues, sometimes more so than the features we implemented. Rather than trying to provide features that replicate these social norms, we suggest:
1. **Studying Households with Positive Social Norms:**
   - Investigate households that exhibit positive social norms around smart home usage.
2. **Designing Systems to Encourage Positive Norms:**
   - Develop and evaluate smart home systems that encourage the development of these norms in generally cooperative households. Based on our study, we propose a few design "nudges" to promote better behaviors in smart home users.

**Nudge Examples:**
- **Norm Violation Prompts:**
  - Smart home platforms could automatically detect commands that potentially violate norms and ask the user, "Are you sure?" For example, this prompt could be triggered when attempting to control devices in another user’s private bedroom or when remotely controlling devices that would impact other people physically present. Such prompts could encourage users to think twice about disturbing others while still allowing necessary access.
- **Promoting User Agency:**
  - During the setup of a smart home, the app could encourage the person installing the system to involve other occupants. This could include guiding the setup of additional accounts and discussions about different devices, automations, and policies.
- **Behavioral Nudges:**
  - Design nudges to discourage excessive playful behavior, like rapidly flicking lights on and off. While playful experimentation is good initially, the app could rate limit these behaviors or display a dialogue box encouraging the user to stop.

While norm-based nudges would not protect against users with malicious intent, promoting positive norms could help reduce friction in generally cooperative households, where conflicts may arise from unfamiliarity with how one’s actions affect others in the smart home.

#### Investigate Designs for Adversarial Situations
Smart homes can enable or amplify harms in adversarial living situations, such as in households with domestic abuse or Airbnb-style rentals. While some of our design principles could mitigate some of these harms, our prototype would not provide adequate protections against harmful actions, such as a malicious admin abusing their privileges. This is a challenging problem because some security and privacy features, like admin roles and access controls, are inherently dual-use. A critical but challenging design question for future work is how to design smart home access controls and monitoring that both protect users from abuse and enable benign use cases.

#### Study Transparency Features for Privacy-Sensitive Devices
A limitation of our prototype was that we could not provide activity notifications for privacy-sensitive smart home devices like voice assistants and security cameras due to API limitations. We propose an in-situ evaluation of user reactions to a smart home system that notifies people if they are being recorded or if another user views or listens to a log they are present in. Notifications could also be surfaced globally with cooperation from mobile operating systems and device manufacturers.

#### Study Natural Language-based Access Control Policy Creation
During interviews, participants clearly conveyed their access control preferences verbally. A possible way to simplify configuration is to allow users to craft policies using a natural language interface. While prior work has found that direct conversion from natural language to policy is possible but imprecise, controlled natural language policy creation could be used to constrain the space of usable words and sentence structures. An autocomplete-style input could guide users through picking access control mechanisms, devices, users, roles, and other conditions.

#### Further Study of Automations and Attributions
We were unable to fully study whether notifications could help users with debugging automations or attributing issues caused by automations and third-party apps due to technical limitations. Other researchers have proposed ways to prevent buggy or malicious behavior by third-party smart home integrations, such as detecting provenance or contextual permission prompts. These contributions are technically valuable, but their usability and utility have not been tested with real end users; we suggest that future work do so.

### Limitations
Though an in-home user study allowed us to study how people used our prototype under realistic circumstances, this study design has several limitations:
- **Focus on Cooperative Households:**
  - Our prototype and user study focused on generally cooperative households rather than those with adversarial relationships. Since we required consent from all participating household members, our sample is skewed towards households with sufficiently functional interpersonal relationships.
- **Group Interviews:**
  - Our protocol involved group interviews, which may have prevented participants from revealing multi-user conflicts and privacy issues.
- **Device Selection:**
  - The devices chosen by participants were generally not among the most invasive, due to both technical limitations and participant comfort.
- **Sample Size:**
  - The complexity and cost of an in-home study limited the number of participating households, preventing us from drawing quantitative conclusions.

Despite these limitations, our study provides valuable insights into designing multi-user smart home security and privacy features for many households.

### Conclusion
Multi-user smart homes face unique security and privacy challenges, such as supporting a wide range of access control preferences and managing tensions between users. Recognizing the gap in knowledge around what designs can meaningfully improve end-user experiences, we conducted an in-home user study to investigate possible approaches and solutions. Focusing on generally cooperative households, we designed a smart home control interface based on principles of access control flexibility, user agency, respect among users, and transparency. We deployed our prototype in seven households over a month-long study to evaluate our proposed design principles and to understand how users interact with security and privacy features in practice. Based on our findings, we provide design recommendations and identify open challenges for future research. Among our recommendations, we suggest improving the usability of smart home access controls by developing more user-friendly configuration interfaces and designing platforms that reduce tensions and conflicts by leveraging and scaffolding positive household norms.
