**ATT&CK ID:** G0010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Turla

Upon initial check-in, Turla conducts a system survey to identify active local network connections. This is achieved through the execution of several commands, including `netstat -an`, `net use`, `net file`, and `net session`.[33][90] Additionally, Turla's RPC (Remote Procedure Call) backdoors have been observed to enumerate the IPv4 TCP connection table using the `GetTcpTable2` API call.[91]

This approach allows Turla to gather detailed information about the network environment, facilitating further exploitation and persistence.
