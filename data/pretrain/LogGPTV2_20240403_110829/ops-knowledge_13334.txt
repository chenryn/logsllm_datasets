I have a Python script that runs continuously in the background and prints logs to the standard output. However, when I log in with the same user on the same machine via SSH, I cannot see the output because I am in a different shell session.

Is there a way to configure the standard output of this process so that it is visible in all shell sessions where I am logged in with the same username as the one who launched the process?

Alternatively, I considered redirecting the output to a file and then opening that file, but I would prefer to avoid this solution if possible.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions.

I have since discovered that `screen` can achieve what I need. 

Thank you, Ignacio.
