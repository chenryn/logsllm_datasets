User: I installed Anaconda a while ago but recently decided to uninstall it and just install basic python 2.7.
I removed Anaconda and deleted all the directories and installed python 2.7.
But when I go to install PyGTK for Windows it says it will install it to the c:/users/.../Anaconda directory - this doesn't even exist. I want to install it to the c:/python-2.7 directory. Why does it think Anaconda is still installed? And how can I change this?
Assistant: If a clean re-install/uninstall did not work, this is because the Anaconda install is still listed in the registry.

Start -> Run -> Regedit
Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Python
You may see 2 subfolders, Anaconda and PythonCore. Expand both and check the "Install Location" in the Install folder, it will be listed on the right.
Delete either or both Anaconda and PythonCore folders, or the entire Python folder and the Registry path to install your Python Package to Anaconda will be gone.
