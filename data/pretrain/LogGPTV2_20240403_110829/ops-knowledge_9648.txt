**Context:**

I have both a system-wide Python installation and a personal Python installation in my home directory. My personal Python is prioritized in my `$PATH` and is the one I typically use. However, there are some modules available in the system Python that I would like to use with my personal Python.

**Objective:**

I want to append the `sys.path` of the system Python installation to the `sys.path` of my personal Python installation. This way, if a module is not found in my personal Python, it will automatically fall back to the system Python's modules.

**Research and Challenges:**

I have read the documentation and source code for the `site` module and learned that I can use either the `sitecustomize` or `usercustomize` modules to modify `sys.path`. However, I am unsure how to get the `sys.path` from the system Python and append it to the `sys.path` of my personal Python.

The `gensitepackages` function in the `site` module seems to calculate the paths to be added to `sys.path`, but it uses the `PREFIXES` global variable instead of accepting it as an argument. Therefore, I cannot directly use this function to achieve my goal. Additionally, adding the system Python's prefixes to `PREFIXES` is not feasible because `PREFIXES` is already used to build the path by the time the `sitecustomize` or `usercustomize` modules are loaded.

**Question:**

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to append the `sys.path` of the system Python to the `sys.path` of my personal Python?

**Additional Consideration:**

I am also uncertain whether this question is more appropriate for AskUbuntu or Unix & Linux Stack Exchange. Any comments on this would be appreciated.

**Edit:**

To clarify, my goal is to have the system Python's `sys.path` appended so that when I try to import a module that is not present in my personal Python, it will automatically fall back to the system Python's modules.

**Assistant's Suggestion:**

You can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the paths of the system Python's modules. This will allow Python to check these additional paths when importing modules.

```sh
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/system/python/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
```

This approach ensures that your personal Python will look in the specified system Python's site-packages directory if it cannot find a module in its own directories.
