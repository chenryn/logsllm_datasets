User: I have a system python installation and a personal python installation in my home directory. My personal python comes in ahead in my $PATH and I usually run that. But the system python installation has some modules that I want to use with my personal python installation.
So, basically, I want to append the sys.path of the system python installation to the sys.path of the personal python installation.
I read up on the docs and source of site module and saw that I could use the sitecustomize or usercustomize modules to do this. But where I am stuck is how do I get the sys.path of the system python to be appended to the personal python's sys.path.
The gensitepackages function in the site modules seems to calculate the paths to be added to sys.path but it is using the PREFIXES global variable instead of taking it as an argument, so for all I know, I can't use it. Adding system python's prefixes to PREFIXES is also not an option as by the time the customize module(s) are loaded, the PREFIXES is already used to build the path.
Any ideas on how to go about this?
Also, I'm not sure if I should ask this on askubuntu/unix&linux. Comments?
Edit: Guess I wasn't clear on this part. I want the system python's path to be appended so that when I try to use modules that are not present in my personal python, it will automatically fallback to the system python's modules.
Assistant: python is gonna check if there is a $PYTHONPATH environment variable set. Use that for the path of your other modules.
use export PYTHONPATH="path:locations"
