ABSTRACT
Stalkerware enables individuals to conduct covert surveillance on a
targeted person’s device. Android devices are a particularly fertile
ground for stalkerware, most of which spy on a single communi-
cation channel, sensor, or category of private data, though 27% of
stalkerware surveil multiple of private data sources. We present
Dosmelt, a system that enables stalkerware warnings that precisely
characterize the types of surveillance conducted by Android stalker-
ware so that surveiled individuals can take appropriate mitigating
action. Our methodology uses active learning in a semi-supervised
learning setting to tackle this task at scale, which would otherwise
require expert labeling of significant number of stalkerware apps.
Dosmelt leverages the observation that stalkerware differs from
other categories of spyware in its open advertising of its surveil-
lance capabilities, which we detect on the basis of the titles and
self-descriptions of stalkerware apps that are posted on Android app
stores. Dosmelt achieves up to 96% AUC for stalkerware detection
with a 91% Macro-F1 score of surveillance capability attribution for
stalkerware apps. Dosmelt has detected hundreds of new stalker-
ware apps that we have added to the Stalkerware Threat List.

1 INTRODUCTION
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a widespread societal problem
that results in negative long-term consequences for many of its tar-
gets [2, 29, 37]. A 2018 survey conducted in eight Eastern European
countries found that 23% of all women experienced physical or
sexual IPV and 60% of them experienced psychological IPV [39]. In
the U.S., 15.8% of women and 5.3% of men reported being subjected
to stalking violence “in which they felt very fearful or believed that
they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed” [9]. IPV
survivors have shed light on the many ways in which technology
plays a role in inter-personal attacks [9, 22, 42, 45, 51], of which
tech-enabled stalking and spying by current or former romantic
partners are especially common and pernicious [26, 36]. In a recent
survey, 10% of the U.S. adult respondents admitted to using a mobile
phone app to spy on an intimate partner [52].

Figure 1: The imprecision of warnings issued by security
companies for dual-use apps that can be used for unwanted
surveillance may lead to concerns that the precise warnings
enabled by our solution Dosmelt would avoid.
While spying apps exist for many kinds of devices, mobile de-
vices are an especially tempting target for attackers, as they ac-
company individuals nearly everywhere they go, are used for most
inter-personal communication, and contain a multitude of sensors.
Mobile apps and other software that can be used by an attacker to
covertly spy on a targeted individual are typically referred to as
stalkerware [38]. Studies of stalkerware for mobile phones have iden-
tified a variety of mobile spying apps and have manually categorized
them into taxonomies that represent different classes of stalkerware
apps and distinct stalkerware functionalities [14, 40, 42].
Though these prior studies provided the first set of solutions to
this important problem, there are still gaps to fill. First, existing
work [14, 40, 42] focuses on the high-level problem of detecting
stalkerware, but does not contribute to automatically inferring the
individual surveillance capabilities possessed by a stalkerware app.
Many vendors of mobile security products that detect stalkerware
exhibit similar limitations in that they tend to lump the varied forms
of surveillance apps together under a single generic “surveillance",
“stalkerware”, or “privacy” warning [3]. An example of one such
warning is provided in Figure 1a. Generic warnings of this nature
are problematic because many of the mobile apps that can be used
as stalkerware may have been installed for a legitimate benign
purpose. For instance, an app that provides backups of SMS apps
and contacts can also be used to spy on a target’s text messages.
Similarly, an anti-theft app can be used to track a target person’s
whereabouts. In both cases, the apps are used legitimately when
installed on one’s own device, but illegitimately when installed
covertly on another person’s device or on a shared device. The
second gap revolves around being limited to a small set of known

stalkerware samples. Stalkerware is still a new phenomenon and
existing work either performs a focused analysis on a very small
number of stalkerware apps [40], or starts off with a small seed set
(of IPV-related keywords to search for on app stores or of known
stalkerware apps) to identify many candidates in an automated
manner, from which false positives are then eliminated through
manual validation. The latter is achieved by assuming either a su-
pervised [14] or a graph-based weakly-supervised [42] learning
settings. Semi-supervised learning methods like active learning are
designed to leverage limited or imprecise sources to provide super-
vision signal for labeling large amounts of training samples [47],
but they are yet to be explored in the stalkerware detection setting.
Taking inspiration from the common phrase, “DOn’t Scare ME
Like That,” we propose Dosmelt, the first stalkerware detection
and warning system capable of precisely identifying the individual
surveillance methods performed by stalkerware apps. Precise stalk-
erware notifications are beneficial in two important ways. First,
when a stalkerware app is being used for spying by an abusive
intimate partner, a precise notification clearly outlines which data
has and has not been exposed to the attacker, which is not possible
when the security product provides a generic warning such as that
of Figure 1a. Precise notifications enable survivors to quickly take
appropriate mitigating actions and are less likely to be ignored than
a generic warning to which customers can quickly become inured.
Second, precise warnings are far less irksome to users who may
install an app that monitors sensors or communications for a legiti-
mate, non-abusive purpose. For instance a plumber whose phone
routinely sustains water damage may wish to backup SMS messages
and contact lists. A precise warning like that of Figure 1b would
confirm to the user that the app behaves as expected, whereas the
generic warning of Figure 1a raises false alarm bells, leading to
unnecessary concern and frustration.
Dosmelt is designed around two important observations about
stalkerware. First, stalkerware explicitly advertises its functionality,
as it is deliberately intended to collect data from a device for the
purpose of making it available for examination, typically by sending
it to the cloud or to another device. Second, stalkerware is a diverse
term encompassing many kinds of apps. We found that 73% of
stalkerware surveils a single sensor (e.g., the microphone or GPS
sensor), communication channel (e.g., SMS messages, a social media
app’s communications), or on-device data (e.g., media, contacts,
or browsing history). Warnings that precisely characterize their
functionality are more fair to app developers and avoid most of the
problems associated with alert fatigue that would arise otherwise.
To provide stalkerware detection that can support nuanced warn-
ings, we formulate a multi-label machine learning problem and
build up a labeled dataset using an active learning paradigm to re-
duce the overhead of stalkerware annotation [57, 60]. Our machine
learning task sets each individual surveillance feature as a label
to be predicted. Stalkerware apps that implement more than one
type of surveillance will have multiple positive labels. This makes
the nuanced stalkerware classification task intrinsically a multi-
label classification problem [12, 55, 61, 62]. For a practical solution
with a small false positive rate, we also classify apps generally as
stalkerware vs. non-stalkerware. Our contributions include:
• We present Dosmelt, a system that detects stalkerware with
far greater nuance than any existing algorithm. Our system
supports the creation of precise warnings that enumerate the
exact types of surveillance conducted by an app as opposed to
imprecise stalkerware warnings that may lead to false alarms
unnecessarily for apps with legitimate uses. It demonstrates
that an app’s self description is sufficient to make headway on
this detection task.
• We establish an active learning methodology to promote ef-
fective learning with a modest set of hand-annotated Android
apps. This is necessary because nuanced stalkerware warning
systems do not as yet exist and we are unaware of any large
dataset of stalkerware apps for which individual surveillance
features had been labeled. Our system integrates a learning-by-
prediction strategy that presents human labelers with samples
likely to improve the classifier. It then recursively retrains the
classifier using the updated training dataset.
• To contribute to the further development of improved stalker-
ware algorithms, we submitted our manually labeled dataset of
stalkerware apps as well as the 246 apps detected by Dosmelt
that we also verified to the Coalition Against Stalkerware’s [18]
Stalkerware Threat List, to which interested researchers and
security vendors can gain access with a free membership.
We proceed by providing background information and review-
ing related work in Section 2. We then describe our data collection
and labeling efforts (Section 3), and present Dosmelt’s architecture
and its learning strategy in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Next, we
evaluate our solution’s ability to detect stalkerware apps and their
surveillance features (Section 6). We discuss deployment and oppor-
tunities for improvement in Section 7, and conclude in Section 8.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In building Dosmelt and using it to provide nuanced stalkerware
detection, we seek to contribute to a rich multi-disciplinary body
of research in intimate partner violence (IPV), spyware and stalker-
ware detection, and machine learning.
Technology-Enabled IPV. IPV produces damaging long-term ef-
fects for its targets, including severe physical violence [39] and
homicide [50]. Physical violence is typically accompanied by emo-
tional abuse, which may result in mental health disorders of many
kinds [29, 44], such as depression [2], post-traumatic stress disor-
der [37], low self-esteem [44], and suicidal ideation [21].
Technology-enabled IPV is a troubling phenomenon that fits into
the broader ecosystem of online hate, harassment, and abuse [51].
Its manifestations include many forms of harassment [7, 25, 41],
character assassination through faked revenge porn [45], imper-
sonation attacks that damage the targeted individual’s relation-
ships [27, 42], and above all, spying on an intimate partner through
stalkerware and other means, such as knowledge of the survivor’s
account credentials [26, 27]. The need for stalkerware detection
and mitigation strategies is highlighted by a recent survey of the
U.S. adults, in which 10% admitted to using an app on a mobile
device to spy on an intimate partner [52].
Spyware and Stalkerware. Spyware refers to software that col-
lects privacy-sensitive data from its users and the devices on which
it is installed [46]. In most cases, the private data collected by spy-
ware goes to corporate entities who monetize it by targeting ads
and by selling the data to other entities, though private data may

also be gathered by criminals for identity theft and financial fraud.
Stalkerware, also known as “intimate partner spyware” [14], is a
special case of spyware in which the software collects private data
to enable an attacker to secretly spy on a targeted individual and
weaponize that data to perpetrate further abuse [14, 26]. Stalker-
ware also differs from non-stalking spyware in that its extraction of
private information from a device is a key feature of the software
that it advertises openly. Thus, while non-stalking spyware col-
lects information in secret and silently monetizes it, stalkerware’s
functionality is only secret and silent when installed on the tar-
geted individual’s device, but not in its online advertising or in its
self-description on app stores and other websites. As we shall see,
this property of stalkerware was used profitably by Chatterjee et
al. [14] in their study of stalkerware.
Despite its clear potential for abuse, the stalkerware phenome-
non has largely proven resistant to eradication thus far. One key
problem from the legal perspective is that the United States’ Federal
Wiretapping Law and state laws only make it illegal to sell apps
that are “primarily” designed to secretly tap phones, record private
conversations or steal emails [17, 32]. As the implications of these
laws have become more clear, a definite change came about in stalk-
erware marketing in the 2018 timeframe, with very few apps since
then brazenly advertising under such titles as “Catch My Cheating
Girlfriend,” and instead touting other use cases while retaining the
same functionality [32, 42]. Indeed, many apps that abusers recom-
mend in online forums for use as stalkerware describe themselves
as tools for socially acceptable tasks other than spying, such as
anti-theft, child online safety, data backups, and the recording of
calls, audio, the device’s screen, and typed keystrokes [14, 53]. This
tactic enables the developers to make claims to plausibly deny that
their apps are being used to spy on intimate partners, and thereby
to avoid legal responsibility when their apps are used for this pur-
pose. Unfortunately, prominent Android app stores still contain
an abundance of location sharing apps, automatic call recording
and forwarding apps, SMS backup apps, and even keylogging apps
(apps that record all keystrokes) [42].
While we acknowledge that many apps used as stalkerware do
also fulfill legitimate use cases, these apps are irresponsible if they
fail to notify all users of the device that their private data is being
extracted from the device. Prominent, repeated notifications differ
truly well-intentioned applications from apps with surveillance
potential that profit from the stalkerware use case. This key distinc-
tion is recognized by the Coalition Against Stalkerware [18] and
the Developer Policy for the Google Play app store [30]. Unfortu-
