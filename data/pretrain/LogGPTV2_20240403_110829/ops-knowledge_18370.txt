User: is there a good way to gather the mac addresses of machines on a local network using Python.  If it helps I'm trying to execute this python script from the DHCP server for the network. I'm new to Python but would it be a bad idea to look at the DHCP leases file for this info? I'd like to use this inside a Django app eventually. Thanks.
Assistant: Really a unix question (one will assume)
You can either look at the arp addresses registered "/sbin/arp -a" or a DHCP lease table.  If you go the arp route you will on find addresses that your system has recently received/sent packets to, the DHCP lease table will give you the ability to see everything.  Though if it's static configured it won't show up.
