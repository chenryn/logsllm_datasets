Question: In the context of DNS security, which of the following statements accurately reflect the advantages and disadvantages posed by DNS caching in the face of network attacks? Choose all that apply.
"A": "DNS caching provides an advantage by preventing off-path attackers from continuously sending fake responses, as the cache will serve requests after the first valid response.",
"B": "A disadvantage of DNS caching is that if a malicious response is cached, it can redirect users to incorrect addresses until the TTL expires, potentially for a long duration.",
"C": "DNS caching is disadvantageous as it increases the window of opportunity for off-path attackers to guess the ID field and inject a malicious response.",
"D": "A major advantage of DNS caching is that it completely mitigates the risk of on-path attackers by ensuring only legitimate responses are cached."
Answer: AB
