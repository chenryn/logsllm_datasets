ABSTRACT
Recently, academia and law enforcement alike have shown
a strong demand for data that is collected from online so-
cial networks. In this work, we present a novel method for
harvesting such data from social networking websites. Our
approach uses a hybrid system that is based on a custom
add-on for social networks in combination with a web crawl-
ing component. The datasets that our tool collects con-
tain proﬁle information (user data, private messages, photos,
etc.) and associated meta-data (internal timestamps and
unique identiﬁers). These social snapshots are signiﬁcant
for security research and in the ﬁeld of digital forensics. We
implemented a prototype for Facebook and evaluated our
system on a number of human volunteers. We show the fea-
sibility and eﬃciency of our approach and its advantages in
contrast to traditional techniques that rely on application-
speciﬁc web crawling and parsing. Furthermore, we investi-
gate diﬀerent use-cases of our tool that include consensual
application and the use of sniﬀed authentication cookies.
Finally, we contribute to the research community by pub-
lishing our implementation as an open-source project.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have
become the largest and fastest growing websites on the In-
ternet. OSNs, such as Facebook or LinkedIn, contain sen-
sitive and personal data of hundreds of millions of people,
and are integrated into millions of other websites [11]. Re-
search has acknowledged the importance of these websites

and recently, a number of publications have focused on se-
curity issues that are associated with OSNs. In particular, a
number of empirical studies on online social networks [1, 15,
18, 17, 29] highlight challenges to the security and privacy
of social network users and their data.
We found that these, and similar studies, heavily depend
on datasets that are collected from the social networking
websites themselves, often involving data that is harvested
from user proﬁles. Furthermore, as social networks continue
to replace traditional means of digital storage, sharing, and
communication, collecting this type of data is also funda-
mental to the area of digital forensics. For example, data
from OSNs have been used successfully by criminal investi-
gators to ﬁnd criminals and even conﬁrm alibis in criminal
cases [7, 27].
While traditional digital forensics is based on the analysis
of ﬁle systems, captured network traﬃc or log ﬁles, new ap-
proaches for extracting data from social networks or cloud
services are needed.
Interestingly and contrary to our in-
tuition, we found little academic research that aims at de-
veloping and enhancing techniques for collecting this type
of data eﬃciently. Despite the growing importance of data
from OSNs for research, current state of the art methods
for data extraction seem to be mainly based on custom web
crawlers. However, we found this na¨ıve approach to have a
number of shortcomings:
• High network traﬃc: The extraction of proﬁle data
via traditional web crawling can be regarded as costly
with regard to the required network resources, as it
typically incurs a large amount of HTTP traﬃc and
causes a high number of individual network connec-
tions. Apart from inherent disadvantages, social net-
working websites may also choose to block network
access for clients that cause high levels of traﬃc, thus
preventing them from harvesting additional data.
• Additional or hidden data: Per deﬁnition, web crawlers
can only collect data that is accessible on the target
website. However, we found that social networks often
publish interesting meta-information (e.g. content cre-
ation timestamps or numeric identiﬁers) in other data
sources, for example via developer APIs.
• Maintainability: The structure and layout of websites
tend to change unpredictably over time. Additionally,
the increasing use of dynamic or interpreted content
(for example, JavaScript) leads to high maintenance
requirements for custom web crawlers.
In this work, we introduce a novel method for data collec-
tion from social networks that aims to overcome these prob-
lems. Our approach is based on a hybrid system that uses
an automated web browser in combination with an OSN
third-party application. We show that our system can be
used eﬃciently to gather “social snapshots”, datasets which
include user data and related information from the social
network.
The main contributions of our work include:
• We introduce novel techniques to eﬃciently gather data
from online social networks that may be used as crim-
inal evidence. Our tool gathers more data than possi-
ble with today’s approaches and it makes it feasible to
link “online evidence” to traditional forensic artifacts
found on computers using state-of-the-art tools (e.g.
Encase).
• We implemented a prototype application that is aimed
at Facebook, and released it under an open-source li-
cense.
• We performed an experimental evaluation involving a
real-world test with volunteers and show results.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 intro-
duces digital forensics followed by Section 3 which describes
the design of our social snapshot framework. We evaluate
the feasibility of social snapshots in Section 4. Section 5
discusses our results, Section 6 surveys related work and
Section 7 concludes.
2. BACKGROUND
Digital forensics has received increasing attention in recent
years as more and more crimes are commited exclusively
or with the involvement of computers. Digital traces help
courts and law enforcement agencies to capture valuable evi-
dence for investigations. Existing research as well as applica-
tions in the area of digital forensics focus on ﬁlesystems [5],
volatile memory [6, 16], databases [13], network traﬃc [8]
and of course logﬁles. The emergence of new online ser-
vices replaces the traditional means of digital storage, shar-
ing, and communication [4]. While traditional forensic ap-
proaches rely on the seizure of the suspect’s hardware (com-
puter, smartphone, storage media) for analysis, the emer-
gence of online services, social networks and novel online
communication methods can render this approach useless: A
techno-savvy adversary might use a computer without hard
disk, communicating securely with the use of encryption and
storing ﬁles distributed all over the world. This would leave
no traces locally for the forensic examiners to work with as
soon as the computer is shut down. Another problem is the
worldwide distribution of the Internet with its multitude of
jurisdictions: while a court might order a company that is
located within the same country to reveal information about
a suspect, across borders this request may not stand.
With hundreds of millions of people sharing and commu-
nicating on social networks, they become more and more
important for crime scene investigations. Traditional ap-
proaches to forensics on cloud computing and social network
forensics are insuﬃcient from an organizational as well as a
technical point of view [2, 26]: the physical location of server
systems is only known to the company, making seizure of
hardware for examination in a forensic lab infeasible.
Often, the social network operator in question cooperates
with law enforcement but in an equal number of cases they
do not. Delicts that might happen solely within social net-
works such as cyber- stalking, mobbing or grooming, in com-
bination with cross-border jurisdictions make it very hard to
gather evidence in a forensically sound manner. A sample of
social network related crimes can be found in [28]. With the
increasing number of users we expect the number of social
network related investigations to increase heavily in the near
future. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) compiled
a report [9] on U.S. law-enforcement agencies’ access to so-
cial networking data. Most social networking providers have
dedicated services to cater for law-enforcement requests. For
example, Facebook oﬀers two types of data: basic subscriber
information (“Neoselect“) and extended subscriber informa-
tion (”Neoprint“). Our social snapshot application resembles
a Neoprint whereas the entire subscriber content is fetched.
Our social snapshot application thus oﬀers an alternative for
evidence collection, especially for non U.S. law-enforcement
agencies.
3. DESIGN
Our digital forensics application enables an investigator to
snapshot a given online social network account including
meta-information, a method we termed “social snapshot”.
Meta-information such as exact timestamps are not avail-
able to the user via the user interface of the web applica-
tion. A social snapshot represents the online social net-
working activity of a speciﬁc user such as circle of friends,
exchanged messages, posted pictures etc. Due to the diver-
sity of information available via OSNs we propose a twofold
approach: an automated web-browser in combination with a
custom third-party application. The social snapshot appli-
cation is initialized with a user’s credentials or authentica-
tion cookie. In the following, a custom third-party applica-
tion is temporarily added to the target account. This appli-
cation fetches the user’s data, pictures, friend list, commu-
nication, and more. Information that is unavailable through
the third-party application is ﬁnally gathered using tradi-
tional web-crawling techniques. By automating a standard
web-browser and avoiding aggressive web-crawling we simu-
late the behavior of a human OSN user, thus minimizing the
risk of being blocked by the social networking site. In this
section, we describe the design of our approach as well as the
individual components of our digital forensic framework.

providing the target user’s credentials or cookie. Our tool
then starts the automated browser with the given authen-
tication mechanism. (2) The automated browser adds our
social snapshot application to the target user’s proﬁle and
sends the shared API secret to our application server. (3)
The social snapshot application responds with the target’s
contact list. (4) The automated web browser requests spe-
ciﬁc web pages of the user’s proﬁle and her contact list. (5)
The received crawler data is parsed and stored. (6) While
the automated browser requests speciﬁc web pages our so-
cial snapshot application gathers personal information via
the OSN API. (7) Finally the social data collected via the
third-party application is stored on the social snapshot ap-
plication server.
3.2 Authentication
In order to get access to the complete content of a target’s
social network account, social snapshots depend on gather-
ing the initial authentication token.
In the following, we
outline three digital forensic scenarios that explain how this
initial gathering of the authentication token works and that
are representative for real-world use cases.
Consent. This na¨ıve approach requires consent from the
person whose social networking proﬁles are analyzed. A per-
son would provide the forensic investigator temporary access
to her social networking account in order to create a snap-
shot. This would also be the preferred method for academic
studies to conduct this research in an ethically correct way
and to comply with data privacy laws. We used this method
for the evaluation of our proposed application as further de-
scribed in Section 4.
Hijack social networking sessions. Our social snapshot
application provides a module to hijack established social
networking sessions. An investigator would monitor the tar-
get’s network connection for valid authentication tokens, for
example unencrypted WiFi connections or LANs. Once the
hijack module ﬁnds a valid authentication token, the social
snapshot application spawns a separate session to snapshot
the target user’s account.
