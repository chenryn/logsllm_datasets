## Abstract

Academia and law enforcement have shown a strong demand for data collected from online social networks (OSNs). This paper presents a novel method for harvesting such data from social networking websites. Our approach uses a hybrid system that combines a custom add-on for social networks with a web crawling component. The datasets collected include profile information (user data, private messages, photos, etc.) and associated metadata (internal timestamps and unique identifiers). These "social snapshots" are significant for security research and digital forensics. We implemented a prototype for Facebook and evaluated our system using human volunteers. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our approach compared to traditional techniques that rely on application-specific web crawling and parsing. Additionally, we explore different use-cases, including consensual application and the use of sniffed authentication cookies. Finally, we contribute to the research community by publishing our implementation as an open-source project.

**Keywords:** Online social networks, forensics, security

## Introduction

Over the past few years, online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook and LinkedIn have become the largest and fastest-growing websites on the Internet. These platforms contain sensitive and personal data for hundreds of millions of users and are integrated into millions of other websites. Recent research has highlighted the importance of these websites, particularly in the context of security and privacy challenges faced by social network users.

We found that many studies heavily depend on datasets collected directly from social networking websites, often involving data harvested from user profiles. As social networks increasingly replace traditional means of digital storage, sharing, and communication, collecting this type of data is also fundamental to the field of digital forensics. For example, data from OSNs have been successfully used by criminal investigators to find criminals and confirm alibis in criminal cases.

While traditional digital forensics focuses on file systems, captured network traffic, or log files, new approaches are needed to extract data from social networks and cloud services. Surprisingly, there is limited academic research aimed at developing and enhancing techniques for efficiently collecting this type of data. Current state-of-the-art methods for data extraction are mainly based on custom web crawlers, which have several shortcomings:

- **High Network Traffic:** Traditional web crawling can be resource-intensive, generating a large amount of HTTP traffic and causing a high number of individual network connections. This can lead to social networking websites blocking access for clients that cause high levels of traffic.
- **Additional or Hidden Data:** Web crawlers can only collect data accessible on the target website. However, social networks often publish interesting metadata (e.g., content creation timestamps or numeric identifiers) via developer APIs, which are not accessible through web crawling.
- **Maintainability:** The structure and layout of websites change unpredictably over time, and the increasing use of dynamic or interpreted content (e.g., JavaScript) leads to high maintenance requirements for custom web crawlers.

In this work, we introduce a novel method for data collection from social networks that addresses these issues. Our approach uses a hybrid system combining an automated web browser with an OSN third-party application. We show that our system can efficiently gather "social snapshots," which include user data and related information from the social network.

The main contributions of our work are:

- **Novel Techniques:** We introduce efficient methods for gathering data from OSNs that can be used as criminal evidence. Our tool collects more data than current approaches and makes it feasible to link "online evidence" to traditional forensic artifacts found on computers using state-of-the-art tools (e.g., Encase).
- **Prototype Implementation:** We developed a prototype application for Facebook and released it under an open-source license.
- **Experimental Evaluation:** We conducted a real-world test with volunteers and present the results.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background on digital forensics, followed by Section 3, which describes the design of our social snapshot framework. We evaluate the feasibility of social snapshots in Section 4, discuss the results in Section 5, survey related work in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.

## Background

Digital forensics has gained increasing attention as more crimes are committed exclusively or with the involvement of computers. Digital traces help courts and law enforcement agencies capture valuable evidence for investigations. Existing research and applications in digital forensics focus on file systems, volatile memory, databases, network traffic, and log files. The emergence of new online services, such as social networks, is replacing traditional means of digital storage, sharing, and communication.

Traditional forensic approaches rely on seizing the suspect's hardware (computer, smartphone, storage media) for analysis. However, the rise of online services and novel online communication methods can render this approach ineffective. A tech-savvy adversary might use a computer without a hard disk, communicate securely with encryption, and store files distributed globally, leaving no local traces for forensic examiners once the computer is shut down. Another challenge is the worldwide distribution of the Internet, with its multitude of jurisdictions, making it difficult to obtain information across borders.

With hundreds of millions of people sharing and communicating on social networks, these platforms are becoming increasingly important for crime scene investigations. Traditional approaches to forensics on cloud computing and social networks are insufficient from both organizational and technical perspectives. The physical location of server systems is known only to the company, making the seizure of hardware for examination in a forensic lab infeasible.

Often, social network operators cooperate with law enforcement, but in many cases, they do not. Delicts that occur solely within social networks, such as cyber-stalking, mobbing, or grooming, combined with cross-border jurisdictions, make it very challenging to gather evidence in a forensically sound manner. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) compiled a report on U.S. law-enforcement agencies' access to social networking data. Most social networking providers have dedicated services to cater to law-enforcement requests. For example, Facebook offers two types of data: basic subscriber information ("Neoselect") and extended subscriber information ("Neoprint"). Our social snapshot application resembles a Neoprint, fetching the entire subscriber content. This offers an alternative for evidence collection, especially for non-U.S. law-enforcement agencies.

## Design

Our digital forensics application enables an investigator to create a "social snapshot" of a given online social network account, including metadata. Metadata, such as exact timestamps, are not available to the user via the web application's user interface. A social snapshot represents the online social networking activity of a specific user, including their circle of friends, exchanged messages, posted pictures, and more. Due to the diversity of information available via OSNs, we propose a twofold approach: an automated web browser in combination with a custom third-party application.

### 3.1 Social Snapshot Framework

Figure 1 illustrates the core framework of our social snapshot application. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization:** The social snapshot client is initialized by providing the target user's credentials or cookie. Our tool then starts the automated browser with the given authentication mechanism.
2. **Adding the Application:** The automated browser adds our social snapshot application to the target user's profile and sends the shared API secret to our application server.
3. **Contact List Retrieval:** The social snapshot application responds with the target's contact list.
4. **Web Page Requests:** The automated web browser requests specific web pages of the user's profile and her contact list.
5. **Data Parsing and Storage:** The received crawler data is parsed and stored.
6. **API Data Collection:** While the automated browser requests specific web pages, our social snapshot application gathers personal information via the OSN API.
7. **Data Storage:** Finally, the social data collected via the third-party application is stored on the social snapshot application server.

### 3.2 Authentication

To access the complete content of a target's social network account, social snapshots depend on gathering the initial authentication token. We outline three digital forensic scenarios that explain how this initial gathering of the authentication token works and are representative of real-world use cases:

- **Consent:** This approach requires consent from the person whose social networking profile is being analyzed. The person would provide the forensic investigator temporary access to their social networking account to create a snapshot. This is the preferred method for academic studies to conduct research ethically and comply with data privacy laws. We used this method for the evaluation of our proposed application, as described in Section 4.
- **Hijack Social Networking Sessions:** Our social snapshot application includes a module to hijack established social networking sessions. An investigator would monitor the target's network connection for valid authentication tokens, such as unencrypted WiFi connections or LANs. Once the hijack module finds a valid authentication token, the social snapshot application spawns a separate session to snapshot the target user's account.
