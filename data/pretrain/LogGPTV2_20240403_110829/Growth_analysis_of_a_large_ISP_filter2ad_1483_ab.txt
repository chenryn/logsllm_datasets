### Novel Contributions
- **Interface Types and Positions:** This study introduces new information regarding the types and positions of network interfaces.
- **Growth Rate Estimates:** We provide novel estimates of the growth rates for routers, modules, and interfaces within a large Internet Service Provider (ISP).
- **Dataset for De-Aliasing Router Interfaces:** A new dataset is presented to evaluate methods for de-aliasing router interfaces, which are essential for discovering Internet topologies using traceroute-like measurements (§2).

### Related Work
Constructing router-level Internet topologies has been a focus of the networking research community for over a decade [14]. A common method involves using traceroute-like probes with incrementally increasing Time-to-Live (TTL) values. This approach was made more scalable with Rocketfuel [25], more transparent to network middleboxes through TCP Sidecar [23], and augmented with IP Record Route option data [22]. These traceroute-like approaches generate a list of router IP addresses, which can be considered aliases of a single router, requiring alias resolution.

Numerous solutions to the alias resolution problem have been developed, including:
- Examining IP ID values [9, 17, 25]
- Using prespecified IP timestamps [21]
- Detecting variations in the source address of probe responses [14]
- Applying graph analysis techniques [15]
- Using reverse DNS lookups [24]

In this work, we use reverse DNS lookups as the sole method for discovering router interfaces, without sending any TTL-limited active probes. Other techniques for topological discovery without traceroute-like probes include inference from passive measurements [13] and gathering data with MPLS ICMP extensions [23] and IGMP messages [20].

Using reverse DNS records for this application carries risks, as previous work has shown that outdated or incorrect reverse DNS records can negatively impact Point-of-Presence (POP)-level path reconstruction [27]. In contrast, our primary focus is on inferring Cogent’s router organization and interface properties, and their changes over time. To the best of our knowledge, this information is only publicly available from DNS records, necessitating careful validation of our DNS-based mapping, as detailed in §4.

The most closely related work is CAIDA’s “IPv4 Routed /24 DNS Names Dataset” [7], which consists of reverse DNS records for router interfaces discovered by traceroute-like active probes. CAIDA’s probes aim for broad coverage, while our work focuses on deep, complete coverage of a single ISP, as validated in §4.

### Methodology
This paper analyzes weekly snapshots of Cogent’s router organization, constructed from publicly available reverse DNS records. We systematically issue reverse DNS queries for each Cogent-owned IP address, allowing us to discover all corresponding interface names. Initially, this required over 17 million weekly DNS queries; we now issue more than 20 million each week.

To minimize the load on the DNS infrastructure, we globally distribute our queries at 90-100 sites using PlanetLab [12]. Worker processes at each site issue queries for all IP addresses in a block no larger than a /19 subnet (8,192 addresses), at a rate of approximately one query per second using the Linux `host` command. Between assignments, workers pause for a random sleep of 10 to 20 minutes. Workers notify our master server every 256 queries (allowing us to detect and re-assign incomplete blocks) and upload a log when finished. This approach enables us to successfully query millions of DNS records each week.

Figure 1 provides an overview of our DNS query responses. During the weeks of March 11 and 18, 2012, our master server experienced data loss. Additionally, our measurement infrastructure was unavailable for seven weeks (from the week of June 3, 2012).
