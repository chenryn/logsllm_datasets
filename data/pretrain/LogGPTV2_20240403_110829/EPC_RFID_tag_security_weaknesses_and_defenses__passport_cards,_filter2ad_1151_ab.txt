feiting protection, we have cloned both a Passport Card
and a Washington State EDL onto commercially-available,
oﬀ-the-shelf tags from the same manufacturers as the orig-
inals. By cloned, we mean that the EPC and TID values
are reported identically by the clone tags.1 Additionally, we
inferred the lock state of both card types and duplicated
that as well. Provided that the Passport Card or Washing-
ton State EDL do not implement additional, undocumented
functionality, the only contents that we were unable to clone
were the ACCESS PIN on both cards, and the KILL PIN
of the Passport Card. The TID therefore does not serve
as the basic anti-cloning tool as envisioned by DHS. One
explanation for this might be that (via personal communi-
cations) DHS indicated that they learned of the existence of
tag-unique TIDs too late for incorporation into these cards.
We further maintain that the characterization of the full,
tag-speciﬁc TID as a powerful anti-cloning tool is overly san-
guine in the long term. While such tag-speciﬁc TIDs may
prevent simple copying of one EPC into another, it does not
prevent the emulation of an EPC tag in another radio de-
vice. In other words, the TID may (or may not) help prevent
physical copying of an EPC tag, but it certainly does not
prevent logical copying.2 An ordinary RFID reader makes
no distinction between a tag embodied in a ﬂake of silicon
and one emulated by a larger, more powerfully instrumented
platform.
A number of general-purpose tag emulation platforms such
as OpenPCD [30] and the RFID Guardian [31] already exist
for HF tags. It is just a matter of time before similar tools
emerge for Gen-2 EPC tags. The Intel WISP [36], for in-
stance, is a physically compact RFID platform with a fully
programmable microprocessor that operates in the UHF do-
main as a Gen-1 EPC tag. A version that simulates a Gen-2
EPC tag is available now as well. Thus, emulator devices
are likely to be broadly accessible in coming years.
The decision to forego the security oﬀered by the TID
in the Washington State EDL and Passport Card thus in-
creases the short-term risks of cloning, as it eliminates a
basic protection against the straightforward copying of pub-
licly viewable values into a fresh Gen-2 tag. In the longer
1However, cloning a tag’s EPC and TID may not be suf-
ﬁcient for an adversary’s purposes; e.g., in some cases an
adversary may also need to produce a false card itself.
2There are well documented, low-cost attacks against smart-
cards, which possess tamper-resistance features well beyond
those of EPC tags; see, e.g., [5]. It therefore seems probable
that an attacker with modest resources can use physically
invasive techniques to alter the data in an EPC tag. And
if only one manufacturer makes Gen-2 tags available with
programmable TIDs, they can act as clones for any manu-
facturer’s tags.
term, commercially-available emulator devices may reduce
the protective value of tag-speciﬁc TIDs. That said, the TID
may still have some longer-term value as a countermeasure
to easy cloning of EDLs and Passport Cards into devices
with the same form factor, i.e., Gen-2-equipped cards.
3.2 Other memory banks
Assuming the Gen-2 tags in the EDL and Passport Card
are identical to the commercial, oﬀ-the-shelf tags indicated
by their TID, the only read-protected pieces of memory on
the cards are the KILL PIN on the Passport Card, and the
ACCESS PIN on both. We have experimentally veriﬁed that
the entire EPC memory bank (which contains the card’s
unique EPC value) is readable, as is the TID memory bank.
The Impinj Monza chip does not have a User memory bank,
and the Alien Higgs-2 chip only uses a User memory bank
when the KILL and ACCESS PINs are not used [26]. We
have also veriﬁed that the cards report a “no such memory
location” error when attempting to read words we do not
expect to be present (such as the User memory bank).
3.3 Kill-PIN selection
The KILL PIN is unprogrammed and not locked on the
Washington State EDLs. We have veriﬁed that we can di-
rectly write this 32-bit KILL PIN. We have not veriﬁed that
we can in fact kill an EDL (an experiment that would be
detrimental to its owner). We have veriﬁed our ability, how-
ever, to kill a cloned EDL with an identical Gen-2 tag model,
an Impinj Monza, over the air. Thus, unless the Washing-
ton State EDL Gen-2 tag is specially manufactured—which
seems unlikely, given the presence of a generic TID—it is
subject to over-the-air killing by any reader.
Alternatively, an attacker can exploit the KILL PIN as a
covert channel. She can set it as desired, thereby “marking”
the EDL bearer with a 32-bit value accessible to any other
reader.
3.4 Read-range experiments
To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work there has
been no adversarial study of read capabilities for EPC tags—
whether EDLs and Passport Cards or otherwise. Read ranges
are, however, a major determinant of the vulnerability of an
EDL or Passport Card to clandestine cloning attacks, as
well as attacks against privacy. As explained above, a single
scan of a tag in either type of identity document is suﬃ-
cient to create a clone. In an attempt to mitigate resulting
privacy concerns, the United States Department of State
provides radio-opaque shielding sleeves with each Passport
Card. These sleeves attenuate the distance at which a card
may be read. Similarly, Washington State is making protec-
tive sleeves available to holders of its EDLs.
It is uncertain that EDL and Passport Card bearers will
consistently use their protective sleeves. These documents
require security hygiene beyond that of other commonly car-
ried cards, demanding from bearers heightened vigilance and
tolerance of inconvenience. The body of relevant literature
on the psychology of fear appeals [41, 43, 8, 9] suggests
that the abstract warnings accompanying EDLs and Pass-
port Cards, e.g., the injunction on the Passport Card that,
“Your Passport Card should be kept in its protective sleeve
when not in use,” may be relatively ineﬀective in stimulat-
ing sleeve use. Additionally, as shown recently by King and
Mcdiarmid [22], most bearers do not have accurate men-

wallet in a front shorts pocket; and (6) Adjacent to a wallet
in a front shorts pocket. The wallet contained 14 magnetic
stripe cards, two non-magnetic stripe plastic cards, nine pa-
per cards, and approximately six dollar bills.
To evaluate the eﬀectiveness of radio-opaque protective
sleeves, we measured the maximum read range in a variety
of situations, namely: (i) In a new sleeve, held out by hand;
(ii) In a crumpled sleeve, held out by hand; (iii) In a new
sleeve, in a wallet in a back trouser pocket; and (iv) In a
crumpled sleeve, in a wallet in a back trouser pocket.
We used Secure SleevesT M from Identity Stonghold, the
manufacturer supplying sleeves for both the Passport Card
and the Washington State EDL [37, 38]. The sleeves are
shown in Figure 3. All shielded experiments were performed
in the lab. We also experimented with the EDL in a sleeve
obtained from the State of Washington and with the Pass-
port Card in a sleeve obtained from Passport Services, and
we report on these experiments as well.
To perform these experiments, we used an Impinj Speed-
way R1000 reader, with a Cushcraft S9028PCL circularly-
polarized antenna. Eﬀective radiated power of the antenna
was 36 dBm, the maximum allowed by the FCC. The center
of the antenna was 88 cm oﬀ the ground, and the cards were
placed directly in front of the antenna. We measured the
maximum distance at which we could read the cards when
held in place for up to ﬁve seconds. We report these max-
imum distances in Table 1 (unshielded), Table 2 (shielded
with the purchased Secure SleevesT M ), and Table 3 (shielded
with the sleeves provided for use with the respective cards).3
3In a few situations, we exhausted the space available to us
in our experimental environment—i.e., backed ourselves into
a wall—before we could ﬁnd the maximum distance. These
situations are denoted with a +.

tal models of RFID privacy and security, and are therefore
ill-equipped to make informed decisions about tag manage-
ment.
The eﬀective read ranges of protected and unprotected
EDLs and Passport Cards in everyday environments there-
fore both have a strong bearing on the overall security of the
border-crossing system, as well as on the privacy of people
with these cards.
While deployers of Gen-2 EPC tags typically cite a reli-
able operational range of tens of feet [34], read ranges can
vary considerably as a function of the material to which a
tag is aﬃxed, the conﬁguration of the interrogating reader,
the tag’s antenna, and the physical characteristics of the am-
bient scanning environment. We backlit and photographed
both a Washington State EDL and Passport Card to exam-
ine their antennas, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.
We evaluated the read range of the Passport Card and
Washington State EDL in several diﬀerent physical environ-
ments, namely: (A) Indoors, freestanding, but with other
objects nearby; (B) Indoors, in a corridor, with no other
nearby objects; and (C) Outdoors in freespace. In all en-
vironments, we also evaluated various ways of carrying the
cards, namely: (1) Held away from the body; (2) Inside a
purse; both inside a wallet and in a side pocket; (3) In a

not to disable itself, the tag replies with a Not Enough Power
response. In this type of low-power session, a side-eﬀect is
that the tag also indicates the correctness or incorrectness
of the PIN transmitted by the reader.
Table 3: Maximum read range in shielded sleeve

Remarks. An RFID tag has not a single read range, but
in eﬀect has multiple “read ranges,” depending on the oper-
ational scenario [20]. In a security context, the “eavesdrop-
ping range” is also of interest. This is the distance from
which a rogue reader can intercept the reply of a tag to a le-
gitimate, interrogating reader. Eavesdropping is feasible at a
much greater distance than direct tag interrogation. Eaves-
dropping is also passive, undetectable by radio-monitoring
devices. Eavesdropping on an EDL or Passport Card in-
terrogation is suﬃcient to enable successful cloning as well
as privacy attacks. We did not conduct experiments on the
eavesdropping ranges for EDLs and Passport Cards, as these
would require specialized ﬁrmware or equipment.
We ﬁnally note that some attackers may not be concerned
about keeping their readers within FCC limits, and by in-
creasing reader power, they may achieve even greater read
ranges. Thus, the results here should be considered a lower
bound on what is possible.
4. DEFENSIVE DIRECTIONS: BACKWARD-
COMPATIBLE CLONING DEFENSES
The Class-1 Gen-2 speciﬁcation has no explicit anti-cloning
features [17]. For this reason, Juels [19] proposes the co-
opting of two Gen-2 access-control commands for authen-
tication of tags, summarized below. We focus this section
on evaluating and extending these protection mechanisms
for EPC tags in general, regardless of deployment scenar-
ios. We then reﬁne our focus on how to apply these general
results to EDLs and Passport Cards in particular.
1. The KILL command. KILL is an EPC feature de-
signed to protect consumer privacy by allowing tags to be
disabled at the point of sale in retail environments. As a
mandatory part of the standard, KILL is implemented (to
the best of our knowledge) in all Class-1 Gen-2 EPC tags.
When a tag successfully receives the KILL command along
with a tag-speciﬁc 32-bit KILL PIN Pkill, it becomes perma-
nently inoperative. Tag disablement, however, is a power-
intensive operation. When a reader transmits the KILL
command with power suﬃcient for the tag to respond, but
kill and transmitting the pair (P (cid:48)
Co-opting KILL for tag authentication. A reader with
knowledge of Pkill can authenticate a tag by constructing an
invalid PIN P (cid:48)
kill, Pkill) in a
random order across two low-power kill command sessions.
A valid tag will acknowledge the correct PIN and reject the
incorrect PIN; an invalid one can respond correctly with
probability at most 1/2. We refer to this idea as KILL-
Based Authentication (KBA).
While a detection probability of 1/2 is not high for an
individual tag, it is high enough for detection of cloning on
a systemic basis. Also, by transmitting N − 1 spurious PINs
and one legitimate one, at a linear cost in authentication
time, a reader can boost its probability of detection of an
invalid tag to 1 − 1
N .
The challenge of KBA, and the one we investigate below,
is the reliable transmission of commands in the low-power
regime of a target tag. Too much power, and the tag will be
killed.4 Too little, and the tag will not respond. To the best
of our knowledge, KBA has remained a research proposal,
and not yet seen empirical study. We ﬁll this gap here.
2. The ACCESS command. EPC tags can carry secret
data D with read-access control. Such data are readable
only through use of the ACCESS command, with an ac-
companying tag-speciﬁc 32-bit PIN Paccess. The KILL PIN
itself is one such piece of read-protected data. Recall that
the Passport Card we analyzed has both of these PINs set
and locked. The Washington State EDL could have its KILL
PIN set and locked over-the-air at the border (its ACCESS
PIN is already set and locked).
Co-opting ACCESS for tag authentication. An entity
with knowledge of Paccess for a tag as well as D can authenti-
cate the tag by checking D. An entity without knowledge of
Paccess cannot extract D without physically attacking the
tag. This mode of authentication is a kind of one-time
challenge-response that we refer to as ACCESS-based au-
thentication (ABA).
We performed an experiment to determine whether ABA
would impact read range. We used a new Impinj Monza tag
4As an alternative to power-calibration, [19] also proposes
the manufacture of tags in which KILL always operates as
if in the low-power regime, i.e., in which a manufacturer
sacriﬁces KILL as a privacy feature in exchange for KBA.
for this experiment. We ﬁrst determined the maximum read
range of the tag outdoors (as in Section 3.4). We then pro-
grammed Pkill and Paccess onto the tag, locked them against
unsecured reading or writing, programmed the reader to use
Paccess to read Pkill, and again measured the maximum read
range. For our particular tag, we found a maximum read
range of 475 cm in both instances, suggesting that ABA
should not signiﬁcantly impact read ranges.
Variants are possible. For instance, without the presence
of a secret D, a form of weak ABA is possible in which
Paccess is used in the same mode as KBA, i.e., tested through
embedding in a set of spurious PINs. This weak ABA is
the only form that would seem generally viable in today’s
EDL/Passport Card infrastructure. Passport Cards carry
secret data D in the form of Pkill, but EDLs, as noted above,
do not have their KILL PINs set.
A stronger variant is possible as a form of crude rolling
code created by overwriting D with a new random value D(cid:48)
on each authentication and storing this new value in a back-
end system. (While an attacker could sniﬀ D(cid:48) and continue
using a cloned card, once the legitimate card was read, the
duplication of D(cid:48) would be discovered.)
Advantages and limitations. Both KBA and ABA have
advantages and disadvantages. KBA is of interest for two
reasons. First, ACCESS is an optional command in the
EPC standard, so tags need not support it. Second, it is
possible to deploy the ABA and KBA independently. One
entity can use Pkill to authenticate tags using KILL, but
cannot perform tag cloning against a second, more privileged
entity with knowledge of Paccess. For example, Pkill might
be revealed to state law enforcement oﬃcials, allowing them
to authenticate tags (and kill them), but not to clone them.
Neither technique, of course, is resistant to eavesdropping.
They are ad-hoc tools meant to allow authentication in the
absence of cryptography or other supporting features. The
most compelling feature of KBA and ABA (where available)
is their backward compatibility. Neither requires any mod-
iﬁcations to already deployed EPC tags. Finally, KBA, if
not carefully implemented, may in some cases actually kill
the cards as a side-eﬀect.
