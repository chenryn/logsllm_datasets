I'm not getting stack traces any time a module is loaded with errors. The
module compiles fine on its own, but when a call to a method of the module
gives an error, the only thing that gets printed is the exception string, but
there is no line/stack information.
This is with the latest Julia on Win7 32bits, both using JuliaStudio and from
the CLI (not the REPL).
For example, defining a module MyModule with a function double and calling it
from another file:
* * *
MyModule.jl:  
module MyModule  
export double
function double(x::Int8)  
x*2+a # this gives an error because 'a' is undefined  
end  
end
* * *
Main.jl:  
using MyModule  
MyModule.double(3)
* * *
Executing MyModule.jl gives no error.
Executing Main.jl gives the following error message:  
LoadError("path_to_Main.jl/Main.jl",2,ErrorException("a not defined"))
This is just a small sample, but with other types of errors and more
complicated code the issue remains.
