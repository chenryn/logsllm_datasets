User: How to confirm whether a network connection is restricted by a firewall? What are some common means to bypass firewalls?
Assistant: The method to confirm that the network connection is restricted by the firewall: 1. Try to connect to other websites or services, if you can connect, it means that the connection is restricted by the firewall. 2. Use the ping command to test the connection target. If the ping fails, it is likely to be restricted by the firewall. Common means of bypassing the firewall: 1. Use a proxy server or VPN to hide the real IP address and bypass access restrictions. 2. Use encrypted communication protocols (such as HTTPS) to protect communication content and prevent it from being detected and intercepted by firewalls. 3. Use random ports or encrypted ports to bypass the blocking of specific ports by firewalls. 4. Use protocols such as remote desktop to connect, and bypass firewall restrictions by simulating local access.
