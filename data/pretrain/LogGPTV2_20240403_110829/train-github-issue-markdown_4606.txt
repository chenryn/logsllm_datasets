It looks like the Windows 7 build instructions don't include something to run
the Chromium content gyp generator as all I'm getting is getting the below and
I can't find a way to resolve the issue when bootstrap threw no errors.
    IEUser@IE9Win7 ~/atom-shell
    $ /cygdrive/c/Python27/python.exe script/build.py -c Release
    ninja: fatal: chdir to 'out\Release' - No such file or directory
    ninja: Entering directory `out\Release'
