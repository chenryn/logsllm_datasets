**Title: Halo: High-Assurance Localization for Distributed Hash Tables**

---

This revised title maintains the acronym "Halo" while enhancing clarity and specificity. The term "Localization" is more precise than "Locate," and it better conveys the concept of ensuring data integrity and location within a distributed hash table system. If you have any specific points or sections of the text that need further optimization, please provide them!
