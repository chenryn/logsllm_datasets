By default I see that
    "initialCols": 120,
    "initialRows": 30,
but truly they are cols=129, rows=28. See

I tested this also with the original `profile.json`.
May be you intend to include also the tabs row etc. but I think it is wrong.
When one sets those parameters in Command prompt (that comes with Windows) the
number of rows and columns is respected. See
