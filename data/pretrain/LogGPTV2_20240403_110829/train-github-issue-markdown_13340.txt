By default, the configuration specifies:
```json
"initialCols": 120,
"initialRows": 30,
```
However, in practice, the actual dimensions are `cols=129` and `rows=28`. This discrepancy can be observed in the following screenshot:

I have also tested this with the original `profile.json` file. It is possible that you intended to include additional elements such as the tab row, but this approach seems incorrect.

When setting these parameters in the Command Prompt (which comes with Windows), the specified number of rows and columns is accurately respected. This can be seen in the following screenshot:
