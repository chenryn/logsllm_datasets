The ES7 proposal for enhanced export functionality can be found at: [https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-export-from](https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-export-from).

The proposed additions include:

### Reexporting a Default Export
- **Proposed Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  export v from "mod";
  ```
- **Equivalent to:**
  ```javascript
  import v from "mod";
  export {v};
  ```

### Reexporting as a Sub-module
- **Proposed Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  export * as ns from "mod";
  ```
- **Equivalent to:**
  ```javascript
  import * as ns from "mod";
  export {ns};
  ```

### Combining Multiple Exports
- **Proposed Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  export v, {x, y as w} from "mod";
  ```
- **Equivalent to:**
  ```javascript
  import v, {x, y as w} from "mod";
  export {v, x, w};
  ```

- **Proposed Syntax:**
  ```javascript
  export v, * as ns from "mod";
  ```
- **Equivalent to:**
  ```javascript
  import v, * as ns from "mod";
  export {v, ns};
  ```

These enhancements aim to provide more concise and symmetric ways to re-export imported values and namespaces, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
