The ES7 proposal is available at: https://github.com/leebyron/ecmascript-more-
export-from
The additions include:
reexporting default:
    // proposed:
    export v from "mod";
    // symmetric to:
    import v from "mod";
    export {v};
reexporting as sub-module:
    // proposed:
    export * as ns from "mod";
    // symmetric to:
    import * as ns from "mod";
    export {ns};
also allowing combining
    // proposed
    export v, {x, y as w} from "mod"
    // symmetric to
    import v, {x, y as w} from "mod"
    As well as
    // proposed
    export v, * as ns from "mod"
    // symmetric to
    import v, * as ns from "mod"
