without revealing these bids, and by revealing the random coin

6.2 Properties of the Protocol
In this section, we state accountability and veriﬁability properties
of the protocol.
Goal. The protocol should satisfy the goal γ which, informally,
is achieved in a run if the protocol successfully produces a result
which is correct with respect to the committed bids. Note that in
a run the committed bids are (computationally) determined by the
commitments to the encrypted bids C1, . . . ,Cn. Now, more pre-
cisely, γ requires that (i) all the submitted commitments are dif-
ferent, (ii) the result is published and the published price bu is the
second highest bid amongst the bids encrypted in C1, . . . ,Cn, and
(iii) an honest bidder is declared to be the winner if and only if her
bid is the highest in C1, . . . ,Cn.
Conditions (ii) and (iii) capture that the announced result corre-
sponds to the bids committed by the bidders. In addition, condition
(i) prevents that a dishonest bidder B j who somehow got to know
the commitment of another bidder Bi (e.g., a dishonest auctioneer
revealed the commitment to B j) can place the same bid as Bi, with-
out even knowing it. This problem was not considered in [38].
Ideally, we would hope that the protocol satisﬁes individual ac-
countability, i.e., if the goal is not achieved, then individual parties
can be (rightly) blamed for this. Unfortunately, as our analysis re-
veals, the protocol does not guarantee this strong level of account-
ability, due to the following problems, which will be reﬂected in
the accountability property we prove for this protocol.
In the following, for a set of agents A, let ψ∗
Problems.
X be the
verdict stating that all but possibly one agent in X misbehaved. For
instance, ψ∗
{a,b,c} = (dis(a)∧ dis(b))∨ (dis(a)∧ dis(c))∨ (dis(b)∧
dis(c)).
Problem 1. This problem boils down to the fact that the protocol
does not offer any effective mechanism for non-repudiable commu-
nication, even though the notaries were introduced for this purpose:
If (a) a bidder Bi claims that she did not obtain her receipt after she
had sent her signed commitment to the auctioneer in Step S2 and
(b) the auctioneer claims that he did not obtain the signed commit-
ment from the bidder, then it is impossible to resolve the dispute.
Therefore, in such a case, the judge can only state dis(A)∨ dis(Bi).
A similar problem occurs if, after Step S5, a bidder Bi claims that
her encrypted bid Ci has not been posted on the bulletin board and
A claims that he has not received this bid. Again, it is impossible to
resolve the dispute. This problem is more serious than the previous
one, as at this point the auctioneer knows all the values of the bids
and the corresponding bidders, and he may have an interest in ma-
nipulating the auction. It is also a good opportunity for a dishonest
bidder to disturb the auction process.
Problem 2. If two (or more) commitments posted in Step S3 have
the same value, then it is not clear who is to be blamed, even if
the auctioneer provided the signatures of the bidders on these com-
mitments. In fact, it is possible that one of the these bidders Bi
honestly followed the protocol, but the auctioneer forwarded her
commitment to the other bidders who submitted this commitment
with their own signatures.
It may, however, as well be the case
that A is honest, but all the mentioned bidders are dishonest and
submitted the same commitment.
Problem 3. A quite serious problem occurs at the end of the auc-
tion. Suppose that the auctioneer posts a result as in (6), for some
w,u, with a correct zero-knowledge proof P. Suppose also that
some bidder B j (cid:54)= Bw claims that Cw is her encrypted bid. Then,
even if we assume that the judge requests both Bw and B j to send
him their receipts and to prove their knowledge of the random coin
rw used in Cw, the judge is not able to blame a speciﬁc party. In
(1) A is honest and
fact, all the following scenarios are possible:
Bw,B j are dishonest: Bw submits the commitment for Cw and then
forwards to B j her receipt and the random coin rw. (2) Bw is honest
and A,B j are dishonest: A provides B j with the receipt Rw of bidder
Bw and her random coin rw; note that A can extract the random coin
from Cw. (3) B j is honest and A,Bw are dishonest: B j submits her
commitment, obtains her receipt, but A declares that Bw is the win-
ner, providing Bw, as above, with the receipt of B j and her random
coin.
This is a serious problem, since a judge cannot blame a speciﬁc
party among the parties A, Bw, and B j; he can only state the verdict
ψ∗
{A,Bw,B j} and cannot determine who actually won the auction.
Judging Procedure.
In order to be able to formally state and
prove the level of accountability the protocol provides, we ﬁrst de-
ﬁne a judging procedure, which decides whether to accept a run or
whether to blame (groups of) parties. Such a procedure should, in
fact, be part of the protocol speciﬁcation.
The judging procedure is based solely on publicly available in-
formation, and hence, can be carried out both by an external judge
and a regular protocol participant. The procedure consists of the
following steps, where we assume that the procedure is run by some
party V .
V1. If a bidder Bi complains in Step S2, then V states dis(A) ∨
dis(Bi) (Problem 1).
V2. If A does not publish the list of commitments when expected
(Step S3), then V blames A (states dis(A)).
If A posts this
list, but, for l > 1, l commitments have the same value (Prob-
lem 2), then A is requested to provide signatures of l bidders
Bi1 , . . . ,Bil on these commitments. If A refuses to do so, V
blames A; otherwise, V states ψ∗
{A,Bi1 ,...,Bil }.
V3. If, in Step S4, Bi posts a receipt without a corresponding com-
mitment posted by A in the previous step, V blames A.
V4. In Step S5, if some previously posted commitment Comi is
not opened, A should provide the signature of Bi on Comi.
If A does not provide the requested signature, V blames him.
Otherwise, V states dis(A)∨ dis(Bi) (Problem 1).
V5. If, in Step S6 A, does not post a result with a valid zero-
knowledge proof and a valid signature sigw[Comw], then V
blames A.
V6. If, after Step S6, some bidder B j with j (cid:54)= w complains and
provides a receipt of A on Comw as well as the random coins
for Comw, then V states the verdict ψ∗
{A,Bw,B j} (Problem 3).
V7. If none of the above happens, then V accepts the run.
Modeling. We consider a few variants of the protocol: By PJ
PRST
we denote the version of the protocol with an additional party, the
judge. This party is assumed to be honest and run the judging pro-
PRST , for X ∈ {B1, . . . ,Bn}, we denote
cedure described above. By PX
the version of the protocol, where X is assumed to be honest and
his/her honest program is extended by the judging procedure (i.e.
X, in addition to his/her protocol steps, also carries out the judging
procedure). In each of these systems, besides X also the bulletin
board is assumed to be honest. All the remaining parties are not
assumed to be honest. For a detailed modeling of these systems (in
a symbolic setting) see Appendix B.2.
Accountability Property. Now, we deﬁne the accountability
property of the protocol. Let αi
rec be the set of runs where Bi claims
that she has sent her signed commitment in Step S2, but has not ob-
tained her receipt (Problem 1). Let αi
open be the set of runs where
some commitment Comi is not opened in Step S5 and A provides
the signature of Bi on this commitment (Problem 2). Let αX
reuse,
where X is a set of at least two bidders, be the set of runs where A,
as described in Step V2, reveals signatures of all the bidders in X
w, j
on the same commitment. Finally, let α
win be the set of runs where
the auctioneer posts a result of the form (6), for some w,u, with a
correct zero-knowledge proof P and some bidder B j (cid:54)= Bw claims
that Cw is her bid and provides the receipt of A on Comw as well as
the random coins of Cw (Problem 3). Let ¬α denotes the set of runs
which are not in αi
w, j
win, for any i, j,w,X.
We will show that the protocol is accountable for Φ, where Φ
reuse, and α
open, αX
rec, αi
consists of the following constraints:
rec ⇒ dis(Bi)∨ dis(A)
αi
open ⇒ dis(Bi)∨ dis(A)
αi
reuse ⇒ ψ∗
αX
win ⇒ ψ∗
X∪{A}

for all w, j ∈ {1, . . . ,n},
(10)
(11)
¬α∩¬γ ⇒ dis(A).
Note that, amongst the above accountability constraints, only (11)
provides individual accountability.
THEOREM 2. Let V ∈ {J,B1, . . . ,Bn}. V ensures Φ-account-
ability for PV
PRST .
The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix B.5. This the-
orem guarantees that whenever the goal γ is not satisﬁed, agent V
states some verdict, where the agent A is held accountable individ-
w, j
ually if none of the cases αi
rec, αi
reuse, and α
win occurs. As
w, j
explained, occurrence of α
win is very problematic.
Veriﬁability. As in Section 5.2, by Proposition 1, we immediately
obtain the following result.

PRST by
hon(A) ∧ hon(B1) ∧ ··· ∧ hon(Bn) and veriﬁable by V , for any
V ∈ {J,B1, . . . ,Bn}.
6.3 Our Improved Version
We now propose ﬁxes to the original auction protocol in order
to establish individual accountability and make the protocol use-
able. In this section, we only brieﬂy sketch these ﬁxes, with the
detailed description of our version of the protocol presented in the
Appendix B.1.
For our protocol, we assume an independent and honest bulletin
board (replacing the bulletin board controlled by the auctioneer),
where the auctioneer and the bidders can post messages. Now, ev-
ery bidder, instead of sending her signed commitment sigBi [Comi]
to the auctioneer in Step S2, posts the message EA(sigBi [Comi],r(cid:48)
i)
(for some random coin r(cid:48)
i) on the bulletin board. Similarly, instead
of sending the encrypted bid to A in Step S5, a bidder posts her
encrypted bid on the bulletin board. One can show that this enables
the judge to resolve the disputes described in Problems 1 and 2.
To prevent Problem 3, we modify the commitment Comi of Bi:
In our version, Comi = (cid:104)hash(Ci), hash(qi),Id(cid:105), where qi is a ran-
dom nonce generated by Bi. The bidder is supposed to keep the
nonce qi secret, except for using it to resolve the dispute described
in Problem 3: If B j notices that the commitment signed by Bw in (6)
is her own commitment, B j posts q j on the bulletin board; resulting
in Bw being blamed.
We prove that our version PV
PRST (cid:48) of the protocol provides a
high level of accountability: individual parties are held account-
able whenever in a protocol run the goal γ is not achieved, where
γ is deﬁned as in Section 6.2. Let Φ(cid:48) consist of only one individual
accountability constraint: ¬γ ⇒ dis(A) | dis(B1) | ··· | dis(Bn). We
have the following result (see Appendix B.4 for the proof).
THEOREM 3. Let V ∈ {J,A,B1, . . . ,Bn}.
accountability for protocol PV
PRST (cid:48).
V ensures Φ(cid:48)-
As in the case of the original version of the protocol, the ac-
countability property stated in Theorem 3 allows us to immediately
obtain the corresponding veriﬁability property of our version of the
protocol. It is interesting to observe that, even though the two ver-
sions of the protocol enjoy very different levels of accountability,
the veriﬁability properties for both of them are exactly the same. In
fact, in both protocols, any dishonest bidder can spoil the auction
procedure and, therefore, the goal needs to be guaranteed by all the
participants. This, again, illustrates that veriﬁability is too coarse a
notion and is not able to distinguish between protocols that provide
strong incentives for the participants to behave honestly from those
that do not provide such incentives.
7. ASW PROTOCOL
In this section, we study accountability properties of the ASW
optimistic contract-signing protocol [4] in the symbolic setting. We
only sketch the protocol and our results (see Appendix D for de-
tails).
Description of the Protocol. The objective of the ASW protocol
is to enable two parties, A (the originator) and B (the responder),
to obtain each other’s signature on a previously agreed contractual
text with the help of a trusted third party T , who, however, is only
invoked in case of a problem. In the intended run of the protocol, A
ﬁrst indicates her willingness to sign the contract to B, by sending
a message m1. Then B sends his willingness to sign the contract to
B (m2). Next, A sends a message m3 that together with m1 forms a
11
valid signature. Finally, B sends a message m4 that, again, together
with m2 forms a valid signature to A. If after A has sent m1, B does
not respond, A may contact T to obtain an abort token aT . If after
A has sent m3, she does not obtain the signature from B, A may ask
T for a replacement contract rT ; analogously for B. Once T issued
aT (rT ), T should never issue rT (aT ) afterwards.
Properties of the Protocol. We are interested in the accountability
of T . Ideally, we would like to hold T accountable whenever it
produces both aT and rT . However, this is unrealistic: T could
produce aT and rT and never send these messages to anybody. We
therefore consider only the case where there is a dispute in which
the judge is faced with both aT and rT . More precisely, by PASW
we denote the protocol (in the sense of Deﬁnition 1) modeling the
ASW protocol, where, in addition to A, B and T , we consider an
additional party, the judge J. The honest programs of A, B, and
