User: Using Cherrypy version 3.0.2
Given a file-structure like this:
static-dir
  2011
  2010
  2009
   ...
I use the configuration: '/static': {'tools.staticdir.on': True, 'tools.staticdir.dir': 'static-dir'}
This works fine fore getting /static/anyfile
But if I try /static/2009/anyfile I get an error. I can add an entry in the configuration for this directory like: 
 '/static/2009': {'tools.staticdir.on': True, 'tools.staticdir.dir': 'static-dir/2009'}
This works, but it there no other way to serve sub-directoryâ€™s? Do I have to enter every directory under static-dir in then configuration to serve them?
Assistant: Not sure in CherryPY, but why not configure your front end webserver to serve static files? You really don't want that traffic hitting your framework.
