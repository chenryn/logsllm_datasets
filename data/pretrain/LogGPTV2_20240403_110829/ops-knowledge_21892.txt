I have inherited a large codebase that uses Tornado to compute and serve large, complex data types, such as 1 MB XML files. Currently, there are eight instances of Tornado running to handle this workload. However, this design has proven to be ineffective, as I am experiencing frequent timeouts from applications accessing the servers.

To address this issue, I aim to make minimal changes to the existing codebase to avoid disrupting functionality that has already been tested in the field. My goal is to transform the system into a threaded one that can process more XML computations in parallel. What approach would you recommend to achieve this?

**Proposed Solution:**

One effective strategy is to use Tornado for handling non-blocking requests while offloading the XML processing to another process or an asynchronous task processor like Celery. This approach allows you to scale the system more easily in the future. In fact, with this model, you would only need a single Tornado instance to manage incoming requests.

By using Celery, you can distribute the XML processing tasks across multiple worker processes, enabling parallel execution and significantly improving the system's throughput. This way, Tornado can continue to handle incoming requests efficiently without being blocked by long-running XML computations.

**Clarification:**

The current issue is not due to computational resource saturation but rather the inability to process more than eight requests simultaneously. Tornado is currently serving requests in a blocking mode, which limits its ability to handle concurrent requests effectively. By offloading the XML processing to an asynchronous task processor, you can ensure that Tornado remains non-blocking and can handle a higher number of concurrent requests.
