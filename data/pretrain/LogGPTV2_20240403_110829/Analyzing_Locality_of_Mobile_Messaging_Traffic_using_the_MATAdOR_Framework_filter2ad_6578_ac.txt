### Summary and Analysis of Mobile Messaging Traffic Locality

#### Introduction
From September 30, 2015, to October 12, 2015, we conducted 406 measurements between 28 PlanetLab nodes using four selected mobile messaging services, resulting in a total of 1,624 measurements. This study aims to analyze the traffic locality and the impact on user privacy.

#### Path Comparisons
**Table 2: Path Comparisons Between Application and Network Paths**

- **Direct Measurements**: The first columns of Table 2 evaluate direct measurements between nodes and show the percentage of measurements that failed to stay within the region.
- **Routing Observations**:
  - All traffic from Israel to other Asian countries is routed through Europe and the U.S.
  - With seven nodes in Asia, six measurements from Israel fail to remain within the region.
  - For two nodes in South America, the measurement between them leaves South America for routing through North America.
  - Only 33% of measurements remain within the region, which underestimates the effect due to the low number of nodes.
  - Europe and North America are the only regions where at least one messenger keeps traffic local.
  - WeChat traffic from Asia does not remain local due to routing through the U.S. and Chinese servers.

**Table 3: Accessibility by Interest Groups**

- **Europe to Europe**:
  - 72% of network path measurements within Europe were accessible to the Five Eyes (via routing through the UK).
  - 98% of measurements were accessible to the European Union, with only internal Switzerland and Norway measurements not being accessible.
  - Threema reduces Five Eyes access by 16% by effectively proxying traffic through Switzerland, which enforces continental routing.
  - 99% of WeChat measurements within Europe were accessible to the Five Eyes due to routing through the U.S.
  - The Switzerland internal measurement offered a direct path to Hong Kong, explaining the one case where the EU could not access TextSecure messages.

- **Oceania to Oceania**:
  - All measurements are accessible to the Five Eyes since Australia and New Zealand are both members.
  - All WeChat traffic, including that generated by exile Chinese, is routed through China.

- **Asia to Asia**:
  - At a network level, the Five Eyes, China, and the European Union can access about 20% to 40% of traces sent within Asia, largely due to routing through Israel.
  - 75% of Threema traffic is accessible to the Five Eyes by routing to Switzerland through the U.S.
  - 46% of WeChat traffic is accessible to the Five Eyes via routing through the U.S. and Singapore.

- **North America to North America**:
  - 100% of traffic is accessible to the Five Eyes.
  - For Threema, traffic from Canada to Switzerland was routed through a direct hop from Miami to Zurich, making two measurements seem inaccessible to the EU.

- **South America to South America**:
  - Measurements from Argentina were routed through a direct tunnel from Miami to Zurich, making them inaccessible to the EU.
  - Only 2 out of 3 Threema measurements from South America are accessible to the EU.
  - Communication in South America is always susceptible to the Five Eyes, regardless of the mobile messaging service used.

- **Russia and Arab League**:
  - None of the measurements traversed Russia or the Arab League, so they were excluded from the table.

#### Summary and Conclusion
We conducted traffic locality measurements between 28 countries for four mobile messaging services. Our findings indicate that these apps significantly distort traffic locality, thereby increasing the set of actors able to access the data. With a few exceptions, such as using Threema in Switzerland, this has a large negative impact on users' privacy. Decentralizing the backend infrastructures of mobile messaging services or using peer-to-peer techniques could alleviate this issue.

This is the first study on this topic, and we aim to raise awareness among users and operators. To conduct our measurements, we introduced the MATAdOR framework, which analyzes messaging traffic characteristics on mobile phones. The MATAdOR framework and the dataset produced in our measurements are available on our website, enabling future work to validate our results and perform further analysis.
