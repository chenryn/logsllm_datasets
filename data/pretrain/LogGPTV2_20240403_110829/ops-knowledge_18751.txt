User: Please explain what is HTTP request and what parameters need to be provided when sending HTTP request?
Assistant: An HTTP request is a process in which a client (usually a browser) sends a request to a server, asking the server to return a specific resource. When sending an HTTP request, the following parameters need to be provided: 1. Method: HTTP defines many different request methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. 2. URL: Uniform Resource Locator, that is, a uniform resource locator, indicating the location of the requested resource on the server. 3. Protocol version (HTTP Version): indicates the HTTP protocol version number used by the client, such as HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. 4. Request header (Headers): Contains some additional information about the request, such as Accept and User-Agent, etc., which tell the server the capabilities and identities of the client. 5. Request body (Message Body): Only when using a request method such as POST, the request body needs to be provided, which contains the data to be submitted to the server. All of the above parameters need to be included in the HTTP request to ensure normal communication between the client and the server and correct processing of the request.
