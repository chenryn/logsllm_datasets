    type MyDatabaseTable struct {
        SomeDescription            string `db:"some_description" json:"some_description"`
    }
    type MyDatabaseTable struct {
        SomeDescription            string `db, json:"some_description"`
    }
To make it consistent with the `:=` and `=` operator when assigning variables.
I think it's a common case to have for example a db and json tag that have the
same value.
