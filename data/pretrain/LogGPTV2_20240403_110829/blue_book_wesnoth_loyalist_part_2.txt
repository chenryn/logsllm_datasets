    infantrymen* because of their vulnerability to cold.) However, you don't
    really want *spearmen* to take hits from *dark adepts*, it would be better
    to let the cold-resistant *cavalry* absorb the damage. The only units
    *spearmen* are good for attacking are *dark adepts* and *walking corpses*.
    *spearmen* are completely useless against *skeletons* unless you level one
    into a *swordsman*, and even then they're pretty mediocre. However, if there
    are lots of *skeleton archers* you won't be able to use much *cavalry* or
    *horsemen*, so a *spearman* or two may be necessary as defenders and damage
    soakers even if they are lousy at dealing damage to Undead.
## [Loyalists vs. Rebels](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists#Loyalists_vs._Rebels)
[Rebels](wesnoth_rebels.md) are a very versatile faction like the Loyalists. So you need to counter
their versatility with yours. Their weakest trait is low hit-points. That is
compensated somewhat by relatively higher defenses and mobility, so you'll need
a combination of hard-hitters and speed. *mages* are also nice for their magical
attacks. Anyways, the key for a Loyalist general is to effectively use his
hard-hitting units and kill as many units as he can at day. And at night, to
defend well as elves ignore the time of day.
The smartest thing you can do upon discovering that your opponent is playing
Rebels, in multiplayer, is to assume that your opponent has *woses* and recruit
accordingly. *woses* are a necessary counter to Loyalists' daytime attacks and
as soon as your opponent realizes that you are Loyalists he will almost
certainly recruit *woses*. Remember that just because you don't see any *woses*
doesn't mean there aren't a couple hiding in the forest! To fight *woses* you
will need *cavalry* as meat shields, *mages* to deal damage, and maybe *fencers*
to get the last hit in. Sadly, *cavalry* are very vulnerable to *elvish archers*,
so you'll need to make sure that the archers die, which can be difficult if they
are in forest. Get *horsemen* which can one-shot archers (despite their high
dodge) and keep up with your *cavalry*. If one *horseman* misses, follow up with
another one, it's a lucky archer that can dodge 4/4 one-shot attempts. *heavy
infantrymen* are also great against everything but *woses* and *mages*, and will
reduce the effectiveness of archer spam. *spearmen* are useless against *woses*,
recruit them sparingly and keep them away from unscouted forest.
An alternative way of playing this match up is to maximize the mobility offered
by the Loyalists' fastest units, namely the two horse units. By using them to
outrun the Rebel units you can achieve some devastating rushes. Some matches
require use of both styles of playing. Again, their versatility must be
countered with yours.
* *Bowman*: (**C-**) Rebels in general are effective in both melee and ranged
    attacks, so recruiting a ranged unit is less beneficial than most factions
    because most of the Rebels' units can retaliate against you. They can be
    useful for taking out an Scout or two, but otherwise, this is not really
    a smart buy.
* *Cavalryman*: (**B+**) A good scout and an effective counter to *woses*. Watch
    out for archers, though, they can really tear horses to shreds. And as
    always, they are effective against ranged oriented units like the *mage*.
    (**A**) If you're going for some faster action, *cavalrymen* are vital in
    the attack. They do great damage during the day, and combined with their
    dangerous mobility, they can be a fearsome unit indeed. Just be careful of
    archers ZoCing you and tearing the unit to shreds.
* *Fencer*: (**B+**) The *fencer* shares the 70% defense in the forest like most
    of the elves, but it has negative resistances. Theoretically, they should be
    effective against *woses*, but more often than not *woses* will crush them
    easily. In spite of this, Fencers still have skirmsher, which means that
    they can sneak behind an injured unit and finish them off. Do not
    over-recruit them, as enemy *mages* will tear though their high defense.
* *Heavy Infantryman*: (**C-**) Usefulness similar to an archer. It's too slow
    to deal with most of the Rebel units, and it is owned by *Mages*, *woses*, and
    even archers. Even though it has a high damage potential and good
    resistances, because of its inherently low defense *shamans* can easily get
    hits on it and turn it into a piece of metal for a turn.
* *Horseman*: (**B**) One *horseman* may be nice, but no more than that. Enemy
    archers will tear them apart and *shamans* totally mess them up. They're
    expensive too. Their greatest use is probably killing *mages* or an archer
    that has gone slightly off-track.
    (**A-**) Again, when mobility is required, these units need to come and do
    serious damage. Since Rebels are mostly comprised of low-hp units,
    *horsemen* at day can usually rip them apart. Again be careful of archers,
    for this unit is worth 23 gold. Shield him properly if he is damaged.
* *Mage*: (**A-**) You'll need these guys to tear though those high elvish
    60-70% evasion in the forest; but be careful, archers and *shamans* will
    retaliate and some pretty nasty things may come from that. One purely
    positive thing though, they just absolutely destroy *woses*. 13-3 at day.
    Ouch. *mages* are expensive and fragile though, so keep them protected.
* *Merman Fighter*: (**B+**) If the map has a lot of water, maybe recruit a few
    to prevent the Rebel's Mermen Hunters from taking over the waters. Otherwise
    they don't really contribute much else.
* *Spearman* - **A** - A necessity. To defend at night, to kill pretty much
    anything except for *woses*, and to be cheap and cost only 14 gold. These
    guys pretty much tear though most of the Rebel units, if it were not only
    for the high-defense archer and *shaman*. Get a bunch, and move them like
    a wall against the enemy units.
At the start of the game, recruit 1-2 *cavalrymen*, depending on the map size,
1 *mage*, (1 *merman fighter* if you need some water coverage), maybe
1 *fencer*, and the rest *spearman*. Later on you maybe can recruit some
*horseman* if you opponent recruits mass *mages*, or more *cavalrymen* and
*mages* if he masses *woses*. Otherwise, *spearmen* and *mages* should help you
get through most of the match.
If you're going for speed, recruit 2-3 *cavalrymen*, depending on the map,
1 *horseman*, maybe 1 *fencer*, and the rest *spearmen*. Use your *spearmen* to
fill the holes and consolidate the territory that the horses took over. Use the
horses to outrun the archers and attack when they can.
## [Loyalists vs Northerners](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists#Loyalists_vs_northerners)
The main problem you will have when facing [northerners](wesnoth_northerners.md)
are two things: poison and numbers. If northerners didn't have *assassins*, it
wouldn't be much of a big deal; you could out manoeuvre them with your superior
scouting units and skirmishers to grab their villages and then finish them off
one by one with *spearmen*/*bowmen*. Thing is, *assassins* poison makes defending at
night extremely difficult, and by poisoning your units, they often force you to
retreat and heal, or die due to retaliation. The key to winning this match up is
to use your superior versatility; the northerners greatest weakness is that ALL
of their units are very average and don't often have many special abilities; you
have masses. Use your first strike in *spearmen* to defend against *grunts*,
*trolls* and *wolfriders* (even at night), use your magic to finish off wounded
*assassins*, and you can charge any of their wounded units and kill them with one
hit. Since all of your units are lawful and theirs are chaotic, you'll want to
press your advantage at day and kill as much as possible (but don't attack
*assassins* with *bowmen*; you don't want to be poisoned and be forced to retreat in
your daytime assault). Another problem the northerners have is that all though
their units are many in number, they do not have a very high damage per hex
ratio. Use this to your advantage; travel in packs and use ZoC lines to prevent
your units from being swarmed too easily, and keep your vulnerable units like
*mages* behind damage soakers like *spearmen* or *heavy infantry*. If you can,
try and make night time defenses near rivers; northerners will hurt themselves
when they attack you, as they have low defense in water and are very annoyed by
deep water, because it prevents them from easily swarming you.
* *Spearmen*: (**A-**) Pretty much your best unit against northerners. Their
    first strike ability is great in defense and their attack power to cost
    ratio is quite high. They also have good health and can retaliate in ranged.
    As in many matchups, the bulk of your army.
* *Mage*: (**B+**) The *mage* is fragile and expensive and has a weak melee
    attack, which is the exact opposite of northerners. Not a great defender
    unless your opponent goes mad with assassins. However, they have lots of
    attack power at day and are very useful for nocking *trolls* of their
    perches and finishing off those damn *assassins*. You'll want a few of
    these, but make sure you keep them protected.
* *Bowmen*: (**B**) Good unit to have. They can attack *grunts* and *trolls*
    (although you'd want *mages* to attack *trolls*) without retaliation, and
    can defend against *assassins* in the night. They can also take out any
    wolves that stray too far from the main orchish army. They're not as good as
    *mages*, but they're cheaper and tougher.
* *Cavalryman*: (**B**) *cavalryman* are superior to their wolves and can hold
    ground against *grunts* and *trolls* reasonably well. It's also a good idea
    if your opponent likes to spam lots of *assassins*, to let them be the
    target of their poison; *cavalryman* and can run away and heal. Your *heavy
    infantrymen*? Not so much. Beware though, of the cheap orchish archer, as
    *cavalrymen* are weak to pierce.
* *Heavy Infantryman*: (**B-**) Heavy infantryman are heavily resistant to
    physical attacks like blade, pierce and to a lesser degree, impact. You'd
    think this would make them great units against northerners, if the orchish
    *archer* didn't have a ranged fire attack. *heavy infantrymen* are also much
    too slow too effectively deal with poison, and that's a 19 gold unit that
    can't fight. However, they are useful in defense if you opponent hasn't
    spammed many archers, and they can even be useful in attack to crush up
    injured *grunts*.
* *Horseman*: (**B**) The *horseman* is a little controversial in this matchup.
    northerners are cheap and melee orientated, which is exactly what *horseman*
    do badly against. They're also quite tough, which means one hit kills are
    rare. However, they have one very important advantage over the northerners-
    high damage per hex. A *horseman* is very useful for softening up units or
    outright killing them (particularly when paired with a mage) which will be
    important in breaking ZoC lines, which can be a real pain with all the units
    northerners can field. Get one or two, but no more, else it quickly produces
    diminishing returns.
* *Fencer*: (**C+**) The *fencer* is a melee based unit that is fragile against
    blade attacks of *grunts*, which means they don't have an awful lot of
    fighting effectiveness with them. On the other hand, the fencer's skirmisher
    ability is really valuable with the many northener units, and can finish off
    injured archers or go on sneaky village grabbing incursions. One or two
    might be useful, but no more, this unit is not a serious fighter! Make sure
    you keep them on 70% terrain if you can as well. Two hitter *grunts* can
    have trouble taking them out.
* *Merman Fighter*: (**C+**) Water based melee unit that doesn't do well against
    the orc *nagas*, recruit only if there's lots of water and keep them in
    defendible terrain, else they'll quickly be killed.
As usual, recruit *cavalrymen* and mermen depending on map (3-4 *cavalryman* for
larger maps, 2-3 for medium sized ones and probably no more than one or two for
small maps). Recruit plenty of *spearmen* and attack at day.
Speaking of that, make sure you travel in large groups and do not attack with
small numbers even at day. Northerners will swarm you too easily. Also, make
sure you don't overextend yourself at day, as northerners do a lot more damage
at night. Pay careful attention to your *mages*, they will be the ones the
northerners will be going after, so retreat them quickly. When defending, try to
avoid attacking units that can retaliate, unless you have a reasonably high
chance of killing them that turn. Avoid attacking *trolls* if you can't heavily
damage them or outright kill them, they're regenaration will quickly mean they
can heal from any scratches your *bowmen* might have dealt them.
