### Estimation Methods for Flow Size Distribution

Given a sampling rate \( p = \frac{1}{200} \), the SYN-pktct Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is not an unbiased estimator and fails to capture key features of the original flow size distribution. In contrast, the SYN-seq MLE is both unbiased and exhibits small standard deviation errors for most flow sizes.

**Figure 2** illustrates the original flow size distribution and its estimates using SYN-pktct and SYN-seq MLEs. The MLE curves represent the mean and standard deviation errors of the estimates obtained from 120 independent runs. The standard deviation errors are computed relative to the average of the estimates, not the true flow size distribution values \(\theta\). Despite the tight standard deviation errors, the SYN-pktct MLE produces mostly incorrect estimates and fails to capture important features of the original distribution. This indicates that the estimator extracts only a limited amount of information from the 5 × 10^9 sampled SYN flows. Conversely, the SYN-seq MLE, which incorporates TCP sequence number information, is an unbiased estimator with tight standard deviation errors. According to the Cramér-Rao bound, the SYN-pktct MLE would require at least 10^17 SYN samples to achieve results comparable to those obtained by the SYN-seq MLE with 5 × 10^9 sampled flows.

Both the SYN-pktct and SYN-seq estimators disregard all sampled flows without a SYN-sampled packet.

**Figure 3** shows the flow size distribution estimates obtained from ALL-pktct and ALL-seq-sflag MLEs, using 120 independent runs with 1.8 × 10^10 sampled flows each and a sampling rate \( p = \frac{1}{200} \). As expected, 1.8 × 10^10 sampled flows are insufficient for the ALL-pktct MLE to become unbiased. The ALL-seq-sflag MLE, however, significantly improves upon the SYN-seq MLE estimates.

In another experiment, the parameters given at the beginning of Section 4.2 were used. **Figure 3** also presents the original flow size distribution and its estimates obtained from ALL-pktct and ALL-seq-sflag MLEs. The ALL-pktct MLE, which uses packet counts, is biased and unable to capture important features of the flow size distribution. Interestingly, the ALL-pktct MLE appears to accurately estimate the fraction of flows with size one, but this accuracy is misleading. Our experiments show that this "accuracy" is highly dependent on the initial value \(\tilde{\theta}(0)\) of the MLE algorithm. For the BB-East-2 trace, the ALL-pktct MLE estimates \(E[\tilde{\theta}_1] = 0.32\) with high confidence, similar to the result in **Figure 3** for the BB-East-1 trace. However, the true value for BB-East-2 is \(\theta_1 = 0.09\), while for BB-East-1 it is \(\theta_1 = 0.36\). This suggests that estimates from ALL-pktct and SYN-pktct do not strongly correlate with the true distribution values.

**Figure 3** also demonstrates that the ALL-seq-sflag MLE estimates are unbiased and have very tight standard deviation errors for the BB-East-1 trace, with similar results for the BB-East-2 trace. The ALL-seq-sflag MLE significantly improves the SYN-seq MLE estimates for small flow sizes.

### Efficient Estimator: ALL-seq-sflag MLE

**Figure 4** compares the mean standard deviation error of ALL-seq-sflag MLE estimates to its respective Cramér-Rao bound. For a large number of sampled flows (\( \geq 10^8 \)), the Cramér-Rao bound and the ALL-seq-sflag MLE mean standard deviation error are nearly indistinguishable, indicating that the Cramér-Rao bound is tight and the ALL-seq-sflag MLE is efficient for large sample sets. For a smaller sample set of 260,000 flows, there is a slight bias in the estimates, but the mean standard deviation error remains close to the Cramér-Rao bound. Thus, the ALL-seq-sflag MLE can be considered efficient even with only 260,000 sampled flows.

### Evaluation on Network Traces

This section evaluates the flow size distribution estimators in an Internet backbone environment using packet traces from a Tier-1 ISP's backbone network, collected via IPMON, a passive measurement system. The BB-East-1 and BB-East-2 traces are from two OC-48 links between backbone routers on the east coast, and the Access-East trace is from an access link in the east coast. The statistics of these traces are listed in Table 3.

Internet flow sizes can be on the order of millions of packets, making the MLE equation (15) with \( W \gg 1 \) intractable. We will now discuss how to estimate TCP flow size distributions over real traces for very large maximum flow sizes \( W \gg 1 \).

| Trace         | Avg. Rate  | Active Flows | Duration |
|---------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Access-East   | 2 hours    | 373 Mbps     | 25 Mbps  |
| BB-East-1     | 2 hours    | 867 Mbps     | 61,000/sec |
| BB-East-2     | 2 hours    | 867 Mbps     | 140,000/sec |

### Large Maximum Flow Sizes

Our model requires one parameter for each flow size from 1 to \( W \). Modeling the tail of the flow size distribution as a Pareto distribution could reduce the number of parameters, but the computational cost remains significant. Fortunately, TCP sequence number MLEs are robust to mismatches between the modeled maximum flow size \( W \) and the actual maximum flow size. All estimates presented next are from the BB-East-2 trace.

**Figures 5 and 6** show the number of sampled flows with labels (SYN, r) and (NOSYN, r) obtained from both synthetic and real sampled traces. The results from the BB-East-2 trace with a packet sampling rate \( p = 0.01 \) indicate that the average is slightly underestimated for SYN flows and slightly overestimated for NON-SYN flows.

### Approximation to \( h(s_{\text{min}}, s_{\text{max}}) \)

Before estimating the flow size distribution, we need to approximate the function \( h \), which takes two TCP sequence numbers and returns the number of packets sent between them. Our baseline approximation \(\tilde{h}(s_1, s_2)\) is \(\left| s_1 - s_2 \right|\) divided by the maximum data segment transmitted on the flow. Most TCP implementations use maximum payload sizes of 1460, 1448, or 536 bytes.

Zero-sized packets and modern web browsers present challenges:
1. Zero-sized packets do not increase the TCP sequence number counter and are almost invisible if not sampled.
2. Modern web browsers use persistent HTTP 1.1 connections, creating a single TCP flow from multiple independent flows.

To address these issues, we use the IPID field, which is sequential for a given TCP flow. If the number of packets obtained using the IPID difference is close to the number obtained using sequence numbers, we use the IPID difference. For TCP ACK flows, we estimate the value of \( h \) using TCP ACK sequence numbers and the distribution of specific payload sizes.

The above function \(\tilde{h}\) works reasonably well, though a more accurate model could improve the estimator. Figures 5 and 6 show the approximation of sample tuples \( n \hat{d}(S, r) \) and \( n \hat{d}(N, r) \) obtained from \(\tilde{h}\) over real sampled data from the BB-East-2 trace. The slight underestimation of sampled SYN flows and overestimation of NON-SYN flows may indicate flow splitting, which is a topic for future research.

### Evaluation and Performance

Using the sampled flow size distribution obtained with \(\tilde{h}\), we estimate the flow size distribution of the BB-East-2 trace using the SYN-seq MLE with \( W = 50 \). **Figure 7** shows that the SYN-seq MLE captures some features of the flow size distribution. The conjugate gradient algorithm took an average of 85 seconds (on a Mobile Pentium4 2.0GHz processor) to achieve the estimates. The ALL-seq-sflag MLE with \( W = 150 \) produces similar but noisier results. The SYN-seq MLE outperforms the ALL-seq-sflag MLE due to its more accurate modeling of the flow size distribution.
