participants does not change the signiﬁcance of any of our
hypothesis tests.
Table I shows the distributions of responses for each
question. Informally examining the tables shows that the
vast majority of the participants conform to the planning
hypothesis H2. For example, 177 (95%) of the participants
answered Question Q1 for Scenario Sp¯f with the answer
of yes as predicted by Hypothesis H2, whereas only eight
(4%) answered with no as predicted by the furthering
hypothesis H1. However, the difference is less pronounced
for Scenario S¯pf where 133 (71%) match Hypothesis H2’s
prediction of no and 45 (24%) matches H1’s prediction of
yes. Interestingly, 31 (17%) answered yes for Scenario S¯p¯f
despite both hypotheses predicting no.
Every test in favor of the planning hypothesis H2 obtains
statistical signiﬁcance at the level of α = 0.05. Eight of
the 16 tests against the furthering hypothesis H1 obtain
statistical signiﬁcance. The eight that do not obtain signif-
icance are the cases where the two hypotheses agree. In
every case where the two disagree, both the test conﬁrming
Hypothesis H2 and the one against Hypothesis H1 obtains
signiﬁcance.
Table II shows the results of using McNemar’s Test to
compare the distribution of responses to one question across
two scenarios. For example, the last row compares the distri-
bution producing responses to Question Q1 for Scenario Sp¯f
to that producing responses for Scenario S¯p¯f . McNemar’s

Test shows that the differences in the observed responses
are statistically signiﬁcant. This result indicates that the two
distributions differ as predicted by Hypothesis H2c. The
table also shows each test’s p-value, which is a measure
of how statistically signiﬁcant a result is. Lower p-values
are more signiﬁcant with any p-value below α = 0.05
being considered signiﬁcant by common convention. The
statistic could not be computed in one case as the data was
too sparse for the calculation. The remaining results are all
signiﬁcant providing support for both Hypotheses H1c and
H2c. However, those in favor of the planning hypothesis H2
have much lower (more signiﬁcant) p-values.
D. Discussion
The results shown above provide evidence in favor of
deﬁning an action to be for a purpose if and only if an
agent performed the action as part of a plan for furthering
that purpose (Hypothesis H2). The binomial tests provide
strong evidence against deﬁning an action to be for a
purpose if and only if that action furthered the purpose
(Hypothesis H1). McNemar’s test provides some support for

Hypothesis H1. Indeed, informally examining the response
distributions (Table I), it appears Hypothesis H1 does ac-
curately model a small minority of participants. However,
Hypothesis H2 appears to accurately model a much larger
number of participants. For these reasons, we conclude that
the planning hypothesis H2 provides a superior model to
that of the furthering hypothesis H1.
Various factors affect the validity of our conclusions. By
mentioning whether or not the auditee is performing the
action as part of a plan, it forces the participant to consider
the relationship between purposes and plans. It is possible
that participants not primed to think about planning would
substantiate H1.
The use of Mechanical Turk raises questions about how
representative our population sample is. Berinsky, Huber,
and Lenz ﬁnd that Mechanical Turk studies are as represen-
tative, if not more representative, than convenience samples
commonly used in research [30].
The use of paid but unmonitored participants, also raises
concerns that participants might provide arbitrary answers
to speed through the questionnaire. Kittur, Chi, and Suh
conclude that Mechanical Turk can be useful if one elim-
inates such spurious submissions by including questions
with known answers and rejecting participants who fail to
correctly answer these questions [31]. By including Ques-
tions Q4 and Q5, we follow their suggested protocol.
VII. APPLYING OUR FORMALISM TO PRIOR METHODS
Past methods of enforcing purpose restrictions have not
provided a means of assigning purposes to sequences of
actions. Rather, they presume that the auditor (or someone
else) already has a method of determining which behaviors
are for a purpose. In essence, these methods presuppose
that the auditor already has the set of allowed behaviors
nbehv(rp) for the purpose p that he is enforcing. These
methods differ in their intensional representations of the set
nbehv(rp). Thus, some may represent a given set exactly
while others may only be able to approximate it. These
differences mainly arise from the different mechanisms they
use to ensure that the auditee only exhibits behaviors from
nbehv(rp). We use our semantics to study how reasonable
these approximations are.
Byun et al. use role-based access control
to present
a methodology for organizing privacy policies and their
enforcement [9], [14]. They associate purposes with sensitive
resources and with roles, and their methodology only grants
the user access to the resource when the purpose of the user’s
role matches the resource’s purpose. The methodology does
not, however, explain how to determine which purposes to
associate with which roles. Furthermore, a user in a role can
perform actions that do not ﬁt the purposes associated with
his role allowing him to use the resource for a purpose other
than the intended one. Thus, their method is only capable of
enforcing policies when there exists some subset A of the
set of actions A such that nbehv(rp) is equal to the set of
all interleavings of A with S of ﬁnite but unbounded length
(i.e., nbehv(rp) = (S × A)∗). The subset A corresponds to
those actions that use a resource with the same purpose as
the auditee’s role. Despite these limitations, their method can
implement the run-time enforcement used at some organiza-
tions, such as a hospital that allows physicians access to any
record to avoid denying access in time-critical emergencies.
However, it does not allow the ﬁne-grain distinctions used
during post-hoc auditing done at some hospitals to ensure
that physicians do not abuse their privileges.
Al-Fedaghi uses the work of Byun et al. as a starting
point but concludes that rather than associating purposes
with roles, one should associate purposes with sequences
of actions [11]. Inﬂuenced by Al-Fedaghi, Jafari et al. adopt
a similar position calling these sequences workﬂows [13].
The set of workﬂows allowed for a purpose p corresponds
to nbehv(rp). They do not provide a formal method of
determining which workﬂows belong in the allowed set
leaving this determination to the intuition of the auditor.
Our auditing algorithm could be used for this task as shown
in Section V-C. They also do not consider probabilistic
transitions and the intuition they supply suggests that they
would only include workﬂows that successfully achieve or
improve the purpose. Thus, our method appears more lenient
by including some behaviors that fail to improve the purpose.
As shown in Section VI, this leniency is key to capturing
the semantics of purpose restrictions.
Others have adopted a hybrid method allowing the roles
of an auditee to change based on the state of the system [12],
[15]. These dynamic roles act as a level of indirection
assigning an auditee to a state. This indirection effectively
allows role-based access control to simulate the workﬂow
methods to be just as expressive.
Agrawal et al. propose a methodology called Hippo-
cratic databases for protecting the privacy of subjects of a
database [8]. They propose to use a query intrusion model to
enforce privacy polices governing purposes. Given a request
for access and the purpose for which the requester claims
the request is made, the query intrusion model compares the
request to previous requests with the same purpose using
an approach similar to intrusion detection. If the request
is sufﬁciently different from previous ones, it is ﬂagged as
a possible violation. While the method may be practical,
it lacks soundness and completeness. Furthermore, by not
being semantically motivated, it provides no insight into the
semantics of purpose. To avoid false positives, the set of
allowed behaviors nbehv(rp) would have to be small or have
a pattern that the query intrusion model could recognize.
Jif is a language extension to Java designed to enforce
requirements on the ﬂows of information in a program [32].
Hayati and Abadi explain how to reduce purpose restrictions
to information ﬂow properties that Jif can enforce [10]. Their
method requires that inputs are labeled with the purposes for
187

which the policy allows the program to use them and that
each unit of code be labeled with the purposes for which
that code operates. If information can ﬂow from an input
statement labeled with one purpose to code labeled for a
different purpose, their method produces a compile-time type
error. (For simplicity, we ignore their use of sub-typing to
model sub-purposes.) In essence, their method enforces the
rule if information i ﬂows to code c, then i and c must be
labeled with the same purpose. The interesting case is when
the code c uses the information i to perform some observable
action ac,i, such as producing output. Under our semantics,
we treat the program as the auditee and view the policy
as limiting these actions. By labeling code, their method
does not consider the contexts in which these actions occur.
Rather the action ac,i is aways either allowed or not based
on the purpose labels of c and i. By not considering context,
their method has same limitations as the method of Byun et
al. with the subset A being equal to the set of all actions
ac,i such that c and i have the same label.
VIII. RELATED WORK
We have already covered the most closely related work
in Section VII. Below we discuss work on related problems
and work on purpose from other ﬁelds.
Minimal Disclosure: The work most similar to ours in
approach has been on minimal disclosure, which requires
that the amount of information used in granting a request
for access should be as little as possible while still achiev-
ing the purpose behind the request. Massacci, Mylopoulos,
and Zannone deﬁne minimal disclosure for Hippocratic
