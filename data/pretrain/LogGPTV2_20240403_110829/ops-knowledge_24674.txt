### How to View Activity Logs on a Linux PC

To comprehensively review the usage of your Linux PC over the past few days, including who logged in, how long the PC was locked, and other user activities, you can use several commands and log files. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide:

#### 1. **Using the `last` Command**
The `last` command provides information about recent logins, logouts, system reboots, and run level changes. It is useful for tracking who has been using the system and when.

```sh
last
```

This will display a list of all users who have logged in, along with the date, time, and duration of their sessions.

#### 2. **Using the `lastlog` Command**
The `lastlog` command shows the most recent login of all users. This can help you identify which users have accessed the system recently.

```sh
lastlog
```

#### 3. **Checking System Log Configuration**
To understand where and how your log files are stored, check the configuration files. On many systems, this is done through `/etc/syslog.conf` or `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and its associated directories.

- **For syslog:**
  ```sh
  cat /etc/syslog.conf
  ```

- **For rsyslog (common on modern distributions like Ubuntu):**
  ```sh
  cat /etc/rsyslog.conf
  cat /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
  ```

These files will show you where different types of logs are stored. For example, authentication-related logs (such as login attempts) are often stored in `/var/log/auth.log`.

#### 4. **Accessing Log Files**
Log files are typically located in the `/var/log` directory. You may need to look at multiple files and their rotated versions to get a complete picture.

- **Authentication Logs:**
  ```sh
  cat /var/log/auth.log
  zcat /var/log/auth.log.1.gz
  zcat /var/log/auth.log.2.gz
  ```

- **System Logs:**
  ```sh
  cat /var/log/syslog
  zcat /var/log/syslog.1.gz
  zcat /var/log/syslog.2.gz
  ```

#### 5. **Additional User-Specific Information**
For more detailed information about specific user activities, you can check the following files in each user's home directory:

- **Bash History:**
  ```sh
  cat ~username/.bash_history
  ```

- **Less History:**
  ```sh
  cat ~username/.lesshst
  ```

These files can provide insights into the commands executed by the user and the files they have viewed.

#### 6. **Lock Screen Information**
To find out when the PC was locked, you may need to check the X session logs or the systemd journal. For example:

- **X Session Logs:**
  ```sh
  grep -i "lock" /var/log/Xorg.0.log
  ```

- **Systemd Journal:**
  ```sh
  journalctl | grep -i "lock"
  ```

By combining these methods, you can gather a comprehensive overview of the PC's usage over the past few days.
