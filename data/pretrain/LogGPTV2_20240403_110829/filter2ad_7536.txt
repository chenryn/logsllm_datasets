## Summary
Biometric data, being intrinsic to an individual, is difficult to replace if compromised. Therefore, biometric systems must be designed to effectively reject fake biometric objects and protect template data from misuse. This paper discusses methods to measure the security of biometric systems against attacks using fake biometric objects. Establishing such measurement methods is crucial for defining the required, designed, and actual levels of security in biometric systems.

We introduce state-of-the-art methodologies to measure the security of advanced biometric authentication systems, including:

1. Iris patterns captured by reflected infrared light.
2. Fingerprints captured by transmitted visible light.
3. Vein patterns captured by transmitted or reflected infrared light.

### Iris Authentication Systems
For iris authentication systems, we have previously introduced a test object consisting of eye pictures printed on paper with a punctured pupil part. Today, we have developed purely artificial test objects that do not require looking through a hole.

### Fingerprint Authentication Systems
In reference [1], we introduced the "gummy finger" approach to measure the security of fingerprint authentication systems based on various sensors (optical, capacitive, electric-field, electro-conductive, thermal, or pressure). We will update this topic with the latest information. To our knowledge, one system in category (2) is the only commercially available fingerprint authentication system claimed to be "gummy finger" resistant. Our tests confirmed that the system successfully rejects gummy fingers but also revealed certain test objects that the system cannot reject. The developers of the system welcomed our findings and expressed interest in understanding the underlying vulnerabilities.

### Vein Pattern Authentication Systems
Vein pattern authentication systems, particularly those based on finger and palm vein patterns, are rapidly gaining popularity in Japan. We will present some preliminary results from our new study using white-box finger and palm vein pattern authentication systems, which provide insights into suitable test objects and methodologies for evaluating the security of these systems.

The general idea of the security measurement can be illustrated as shown in Figure 1.
