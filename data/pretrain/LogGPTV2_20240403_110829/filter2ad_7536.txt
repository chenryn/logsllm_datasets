SUMMARY 
Compromise of biometrics will be serious since they are hard to 
replace because they are intrinsic to person. Therefore, biometric 
systems  must  possess  the  function  to  effectively  reject  fake 
biometric  objects  or  patterns  as  well  as  to  protect  the  template 
data  against  abuse.  We  discuss  how  to  measure  the  security  of 
each  biometric  system  against  attacks  using  fake  biometric 
objects.  Existence  of  such  measuring  methods  is  very  important 
for  establishing  the  way  to  describe  the  required,  the  designed, 
and  the  really  providing  level  or  quality  of  security  of  each 
biometric system.  
We  will  introduce  the  state-of-art  methodology  to  measure  or 
assess security of advanced biometric authentication systems such 
as those based on 
 (1) iris patterns captured by reflected infrared light, 
 (2) finger prints captured by transmitted visible light, 
 (3)  vein  patterns  captured  by  transmitted  or  reflected  infrared 
light. 
As  a  test  object  for  iris  authentication  systems  (1),  so  far  we 
introduced the eye-picture-printed paper with punctured pupil part

with  the  method  to  use  it.  Today  we  have  purely  artificial  test 
objects. Namely there is no need to look through the hole. 
In  reference  [1],  we  introduced  “gummy  finger”  approach  to 
measure  security  of  fingerprint  authentication  systems  based  on 
optical,  capacitive,  electric-field,  electro  conductive,  thermal,  or 
pressure  sensors.  We  will  update  this  topic  with  the  latest 
information.  Some  system  in  category  (2)  is  the  only  ---  to  the 
author’s  knowledge  ---  actually  commercialized  fingerprint 
authentication  system  that  is  claimed  "gummy  finger"  resistant. 
We confirmed that the system successfully rejects gummy fingers 
but also proved that there are certain test objects that cannot be 
rejected by the system. The researchers who developed the system 
celebrated  our  results  and  told  the  interest  to  clarify  why  such 
vulnerability does exist.  
Another 
to  vein  pattern 
authentication systems (3) which deployment is rapidly increasing 
in  Japan.  What  are  suitable  test  objects  and  methodology  to 
distinguish  security  of  each  biometric  system  in  this  category? 
We can show you some partial answer to the question based on 
our brand new study using white-box finger and palm vein pattern 
authentication systems. 
The general idea of the security measurement can be depicted as
