### Current Behavior:
I am attempting to configure a project to install dependencies from NPM. I
will be publishing the project to GitHub Packages as a private package. If I
use this syntax in my project's `.npmrc`:
    @my-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
I can install dependencies from NPM using `npm install` on my local machine.
However, I cannot publish to GitHub Packages using `npm publish`. NPM informs
me that I'm not authenticated. If I use this syntax in my project's `.npmrc`:
    registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/my-org/
I can publish using `npm publish`, but I cannot install dependencies with `npm
install`. NPM informs me that it's trying to install dependencies from GitHub
Packages, rather than NPM.
### Expected Behavior:
Based on my reading, both syntaxes should be compatible with `npm install` and
`npm publish`. However, it appears I can only use one or the other, based on
my intended use.
### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Install Node `v15.7.0` and NPM `7.4.3` via nvm.
  2. Log in to GitHub Packages with the command:
        npm login --scope=@my-org --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
  3. Check our `~/.npmrc` file in our home folder. It should read:
        @my-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=
  4. Create project with the following `package.json`:
        {
      "name": "@my-org/my-package",
      "description": "A test.",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "repository": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/my-org/my-package.git"
      },
      "keywords": ["example"],
      "author": "Me",
      "license": "ISC",
      "bugs": {
        "url": "https://github.com/my-org/my-package/issues"
      },
      "homepage": "https://github.com/my-org/my-package",
      "dependencies": {
        "bootstrap": "^4.5.2"
      }
    }
  5. Add the following `.npmrc` to our project:
        @my-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
  6. Run `npm install`. Installation should succeed.
  7. Run `npm publish`. Receive the following error:
        npm ERR! code ENEEDAUTH
    npm ERR! need auth This command requires you to be logged in.
    npm ERR! need auth You need to authorize this machine using `npm adduser`

  8. Change the project `.npmrc` to:
        registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/my-org/
  9. Run `npm publish`. Publishing should succeed.
  10. `rm -rf node_modules/ package-lock.json` in project.
  11. Run `npm install`. Receive following error:
        npm ERR! code E401
