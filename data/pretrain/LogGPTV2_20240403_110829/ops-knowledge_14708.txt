User: I have 2 processes: Start and Status. There can be multiple Start processes executed on the same time and there should only be 1 instance of Status process. 
On startup of the Start process, it will attempt to start Status. At the moment, I try to stop multiple Statuses from starting by getting the Status process to check if Status's server port has been binded to determine if there is another Status that exists and if so it will shutdown gracefully.
However this has a race condition where the time it checks for the binded port, there might be another Status that had done that check and is in the process of binding that port, hence 2 Statuses will be created.
Is there a process level solution to this? I have considered having another process monitoring the number of Statuses in the System but is there another approach?
Edit: This is done in Python 2.6
Edit2: Both Start and Status are excuted from the shell.
Assistant: There are likely pythonic ways, but myself I would use a process supervisor like daemontools, systemd, runit etc - to start and supervise the status process to ensure there is one and only one.
