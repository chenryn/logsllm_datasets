  - Messing with computers since 1989 (TIN, PINE, yTalk, Lynx, MUDs, etc.)
  - 8 years in a large food manufacturer, building and securing SCADA/ICS systems across 90+ plants in the US.
  - 6 years building out a security function in one of the largest pharmaceutical drug distributors in the US.
  - Currently, Chief Endpoint Security Architect at a large tech company, focusing on Cyber Resiliency techniques in the endpoint space.

### Agenda
1. Unexpected Journey to a Cyber Attack Lifecycle Game
2. Research that Led to the Development of the Game
3. Maelstrom: The Game

### Strategy Journey
- From a past life, I was asked by a CIO, "Do they win?"
- Later, I was tasked with evaluating a solution for over 300,000 endpoints.
- Like most, I looked at requirements, functionality, capabilities, and operationalization.
- The resulting heat map was not very useful for large-scale decision-making.
- The question "Do they win?" stuck with me, leading to the development of better strategic choices.

### Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain®
- **Reconnaissance:**
  - Research, ID/selection of targets
  - Email addresses, social relationships, target technology, and topology
- **Weaponization:**
  - Combining an exploit with a payload to establish/maintain access by an attacker
- **Delivery:**
  - Transmission of the weapon to the target environment
- **Exploitation:**
  - Exploit is triggered on the target
- **Installation:**
  - Payload is executed
- **Command and Control:**
  - Communication and control established between the attacker and the target
- **Action Objectives:**
  - Recon/Pivot, Destruction, Exfiltration

### Charting the Attacker’s Progression
- The attacker's plan resembles a Gantt chart or project plan.
- Evidence of organized attackers:
  - Different skill levels indicating different 'resources or teams'
  - Different teams using different tool sets
  - Different time schedules indicating 'shift work'
  - Follow scripts and make mistakes, redoing work or retrying tasks

### Tortuosa Concept: Attacking the Attacker’s Plan
- Mapping these plans can reveal weaknesses in the attacker’s plan.
- Techniques to disrupt the attacker’s project plan:
  - **Time:**
    - Replays: Accept only replayed web sessions with an additional token
    - Snapshots: Use virtualized environments; revert unpredictably
    - Predecessors and Successors: Feigning completion
  - **Resources and Tools:**
    - Create resource unavailability: Block Cloudflare during Team F stage, forcing them to find another team or resource
    - Create resource contention: Flood your own machines; sacrificial lambs
    - Remove tools like PSEXEC, WMI, PowerShell
  - **Scope:**
    - Create scope creep utilizing deception with fake targets or tarpits
  - **Cost:**
    - Increase costs by setting the attacker back, thereby decreasing the cost to the defender to remediate
  - **Quality:**
    - Create noise and anomalies to disrupt attackers, automation, and scripts

### Building a Catalog of Attack Patterns
- **MITRE’s CAPEC (Common Attack Patterns and Enumeration Catalogue):**
  - Over 500 techniques, slightly unmanageable for my needs.
- **MITRE’s ATT&CK Framework (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge):**
  - 68 techniques, more manageable.
  - Attack lifecycle map.
  - A win!

### Research-Based Attack Catalog Techniques
- **Build a catalog of attack patterns using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework (August 2015):**
  - Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Credential Access, Host Enumeration, Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement, Command and Control, Exfiltration
  - Detailed techniques include:
    - New service, exploitation of vulnerabilities, OS/software weaknesses, process enumeration, software packing, RDP, common protocols, standard and non-standard channels, DLL Proxying, service file permissions, user interaction, service enumeration, masquerading, Windows admin shares, local network connections, DLL injection, remote vulnerability, encrypted communications, exfiltration over other mediums, hypervisor rootkit, DLL path hijacking, stored files, logon scripts, obfuscated payloads, application deployment software, distributed communications, registry run keys, modification of shortcuts, account enumeration, indicator removal, taint shared content, multiple protocols combined, data staging, and more.

By understanding and disrupting the attacker’s plan, we can better protect our systems and data.
