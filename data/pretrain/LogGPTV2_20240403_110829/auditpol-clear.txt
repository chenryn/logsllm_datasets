auditpol clear
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
Deletes the per-user audit policy for all users, resets (disables) the system audit policy for all subcategories, and sets all the auditing options to disabled.
To perform clear operations on the per-user and system policies, you must have Write or Full Control permission for that object set in the security descriptor. You can also perform clear operations if you have the Manage auditing and security log (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right allows additional access that is not necessary to perform the overall clear operations.
