### `auditpol clear` Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `auditpol clear` command deletes the per-user audit policy for all users, resets (disables) the system audit policy for all subcategories, and sets all auditing options to disabled.

**Permissions:**
To perform clear operations on both per-user and system policies, you must have either Write or Full Control permission for the relevant objects in the security descriptor. Alternatively, you can perform these operations if you have the "Manage auditing and security log" (SeSecurityPrivilege) user right. However, this right grants additional access that is not strictly necessary for the clear operations.

**Syntax:**
```shell
auditpol /clear [/y]
```

**Parameters:**
- `/y`: Suppresses the confirmation prompt asking whether all audit policy settings should be cleared.
- `/?`: Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

1. **With Confirmation Prompt:**
   To delete the per-user audit policy for all users, reset (disable) the system audit policy for all subcategories, and set all audit policy settings to disabled, type:
   ```shell
   auditpol /clear
   ```

2. **Without Confirmation Prompt:**
   To delete the per-user audit policy for all users, reset the system audit policy settings for all subcategories, and set all audit policy settings to disabled without a confirmation prompt, type:
   ```shell
   auditpol /clear /y
   ```

**Note:**
The second example is particularly useful when using scripts to automate the operation.
