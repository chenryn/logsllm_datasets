Reverse lookup zones 
Forward Lookup Zones 
To create a forward lookup zone by using the DNS snap-in, open the snap-in, right-click the Forward 
Lookup Zones node in the tree, and click New Zone. The New Zone Wizard launches and guides you 
through creating a forward lookup zone. In the New Zone Wizard, you must specify the following: 
Whether to create a primary, secondary, or stub zone 
Whether to store the zone in Active Directory 
For Active Directory storage, whether to replicate the zone to all DNS servers in the forest, to all DNS 
servers in the domain, or to all domain controllers in the domain 
What the FQDN of the zone should be 
Whether to allow dynamic updates, to require secure dynamic updates, or both 
For secondary and stub zones, from which master name servers (as specified by IPv4 or IPv6 address) 
the DNS Server service obtains the zone data 
To modify the properties of a forward lookup zone, open the DNS snap-in, right-click the zone under the 
Forward Lookup Zones folder in the tree, and click Properties. Figure 9-6 shows an example of the 
resulting ForwardZoneName Properties dialog box.

To complete the delegation, you create the delegated domain zones on the servers specified in the 
New Delegation Wizard. 
Zone Transfers 
You can configure zone transfers from the Zone Transfers tab in the properties dialog box for the 
zone. Figure 9-8 shows an example of the Zone Transfers tab for a forward lookup zone. 
Figure 9-8  The Zone Transfers tab for a forward lookup zone 
From the Zone Transfers tab, you can configure the following: 
Whether zone transfers for the zone are allowed. 
The servers to which zone transfers are allowed. You can specify any server, only the servers listed on 
the Name Servers tab, or specific servers listed by IPv4 or IPv6 address. 
The notify list (click Notify), from which you can specify the servers on the Name Servers tab or 
specific servers listed by IPv4 address. 
Resource Records 
The DNS Server service stores resource records in their respective containers in a zone. You might 
manually configure the following typical resource records: 
IPv4 address records 
IPv6 address records 
Pointer records 
IPv4 Address Records 
To manually add an IPv4 address record (also known as an Address [A] record), open the DNS snap-
in, right-click the appropriate forward lookup zone in the tree, and then click New Host (A or AAAA) or 
New Host (A). In the New Host dialog box, type the host portion of the domain name and its IPv4

address. You can also  automatically create the associated PTR record, allow an unauthenticated 
update to the record, and specify the Time-to-Live (TTL) for the A and PTR records. 
Computers running Windows automatically add their IPv4 host address resource records using dynamic 
update. For more information, see "Dynamic Update and Secure Dynamic Update" in this chapter. 
IPv6 Address Records 
To manually add an IPv6 address record (also known as a AAAA record) in Windows Server 2008, 
open the DNS snap-in, right-click the appropriate forward lookup zone in the tree, and then click New 
Host (A or AAAA). For Windows Server 2003, click Other New Records. In the Resource Record 
Type dialog box, click IPv6 Host (AAAA), and then click Create Record. In the New Host dialog box, 
type the host portion of the domain name and its IPv6 address. You can also automatically delete the 
record if it becomes stale and specify its TTL. 
A computer running Windows with the IPv6 protocol automatically adds AAAA resource records for site-
local and global IPv6 addresses using dynamic update. For more information, see "Dynamic Update 
and Secure Dynamic Update" in this chapter. The IPv6 protocol does not register link-local addresses 
or global addresses with temporary interface identifiers using dynamic update. 
Pointer Records 
To manually add a Pointer (PTR) resource record for an IP address, open the DNS snap-in, right-click 
the appropriate reverse lookup zone in the tree, and then click New Pointer (PTR). In the New 
Resource Record dialog box, type the host IP address (in reverse order, if needed) and the host's 
FQDN. You can also automatically delete the record if it becomes stale, allow an unauthenticated 
update to the record, and specify its TTL. 
Computers running Windows automatically add their PTR records using dynamic update. For more 
information, see "Dynamic Update and Secure Dynamic Update" in this chapter. 
DNS Traffic Over IPv6 
By default, the DNS Server service in Windows Server 2008 listens for DNS traffic sent over IPv6. By 
default, the DNS Server service in Windows Server 2003 does not listen for DNS traffic sent over IPv6. 
You can configure DNS servers running Windows Server 2003 and DNS clients running Windows Vista 
or Windows Server 2008 to use DNS traffic over IPv6 through either locally configured or well-known 
unicast addresses of DNS servers. 
Using Locally Configured Unicast Addresses 
In this method, DNS clients and servers send DNS traffic over IPv6 to a unicast address locally 
assigned to the DNS server, such as a site-local or global address of the DNS server configured 
through IPv6 address autoconfiguration. This method requires the following steps: 
1. On each DNS server running Windows Server 2003, enable the DNS Server service for DNS traffic 
by using the dnscmd /config /EnableIPv6 1 command and then restarting the DNS Server service. 
2. Obtain the global or unique local addresses of each DNS server by using the ipconfig command. 
3. Configure each Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 DNS client computer with the unicast IPv6 
addresses of your DNS servers using the netsh interface ipv6 add dnsserver

interface=NameOrIndex address=IPv6Address index=PreferenceLevel command.  
Using Well-Known Unicast Addresses 
In this method, DNS clients and servers send DNS traffic over IPv6 to a set of well-known unicast 
addresses that have been manually configured on the DNS server. Computers running Windows Vista 
or Windows Server 2008 automatically attempt to use DNS servers at the well-known unicast 
addresses of FEC0:0:0:FFFF::1, FEC0:0:0:FFFF::2, and FEC0:0:0:FFFF::3. This method requires the 
following steps: 
1. Determine which well-known unicast addresses to assign to which DNS servers.   
2. On each DNS server, add one or more of the well-known unicast addresses using the netsh 
interface ipv6 add address interface=NameOrIndex address=IPv6Address command. 
3. Add host routes for the well-known unicast addresses to your routing infrastructure so that the DNS 
servers are reachable from all of your IPv6-based DNS client computers. First, you must add host 
routes for the DNS server addresses to the neighboring routers of the DNS servers. If you are using 
an IPv6 routing protocol, configure it to propagate host routes to the non-neighboring IPv6 routers. If 
you are using static IPv6 routers, add host routes with the appropriate next-hop and metric 
information to all the non-neighboring routers. 
Dynamic Update and Secure Dynamic Update 
DHCP servers assign IPv4 addresses and other configuration settings to DHCP client computers. 
These addresses are valid for a specific lease time. If the DHCP client computer cannot renew the 
current lease or moves to another subnet, the DHCP server assigns a new IPv4 address configuration 
to the client computer. This variability of IPv4 address configuration for DHCP client computers 
complicates DNS administration because you must update A and PTR resource records. 
RFC 2136 describes the DNS dynamic update protocol, which keeps DNS current in a DHCP 
environment. DNS dynamic update allows DNS client computers to both register and dynamically 
update their resource records with a DNS server whenever the client computers’ IP addresses or 
names change. This process reduces the need for you to administer zone records manually, especially 
for computers that use DHCP. 
Windows supports DNS dynamic update for both the DNS clients and servers. For DNS servers, you 
can use the DNS Server service to enable dynamic updates on a per-zone basis for either standard 
primary zones or zones that are integrated with Active Directory.  
DNS clients running Windows register A and PTR resource records for IPv4 addresses and AAAA 
records for IPv6 addresses in DNS by default. Additionally, domain controllers and other service-
providing computers register service (SRV) resource records in DNS. Because SRV resource records 
provide a way to resolve service names to IP addresses, registering them with DNS allows client 
computers running Windows to locate domain controllers and other types of servers. 
DNS clients that are running Windows send dynamic updates in the following circumstances: 
For statically assigned IP addresses, when the computer is started or an IP address on any of the 
computer’s network connections is added, removed, or modified.  
Chapter 9 – Windows Support for DNS 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 262 
For dynamically assigned IP addresses, when an IP address lease on any of the computers’ network 
connections changes or is renewed with the DHCP server (for example, when the computer is started 
or the ipconfig /renew command is used).  
When the Net Logon service is started on domain controllers. 
When a member server is promoted to a domain controller. 
When the user runs the ipconfig /registerdns command to manually force a refresh of name 
registration in DNS.  
Periodically after the initial dynamic update (by default, every seven days). 
When one of these events triggers a dynamic update, the DHCP Client service on the computer running 
Windows sends the update. For IPv4-based addresses, the DHCP Client service sends the updates, 
rather than the DNS Client service, because the DHCP Client service provides IP address 
configuration, whether static or dynamic, to TCP/IP in Windows and monitors changes in IP address 
configuration.  
For IPv6-based addresses, the IPv6 protocol component sends the updates when the computer is 
started or an IPv6 address on any of the computer’s network connections is added, removed, or 
modified. 
How Computers Running Windows Update their DNS Names 
The specific mechanism and types of records registered by a computer running Windows depends on 
whether its IPv4 configuration is static (configured manually) or automatic (configured using DHCP): 
By default, computers running Windows that are manually configured with static IPv4 addresses 
attempt to dynamically register A and PTR resource records for all configured DNS names.  
By default, computers running Windows that are automatically configured with IPv4 addresses allocated 
by a DHCP server attempt to dynamically register A resource records. The DHCP server attempts to 
dynamically register the PTR resource records on the DHCP client's behalf. This behavior is controlled 
by: 
The inclusion of the Client FQDN DHCP option (option 81) in the DHCPRequest message sent by 
the DHCP client.  
In the DHCP snap-in, the settings on the DNS tab (see Figure 9-9) for the properties of a DHCP 
server or the properties of a DHCP scope. 
For DHCP clients that do not send the Client FQDN option, the DHCP server does not automatically 
register the A or PTR resource records on the DHCP client's behalf. To enable this support, you can 
select the Dynamically update DNS A and PTR records for DHCP clients that do not request 
updates check box on the DNS tab. 
Figure 9-9 shows the DNS tab in the properties dialog box of a DHCP server.

DNS Dynamic Update Process 
A DNS client computer running Windows uses the following process to perform a DNS dynamic update: 
1. The client queries its configured DNS server to find the Start of Authority (SOA) resource record for 
the DNS zone of the DNS name that is being updated. 
2. The DNS client's configured DNS server performs the standard name resolution process and sends 
the SOA record, which contains the IP address of the primary name server for the queried DNS zone. 
3. The client sends a dynamic update request to the primary name server for the zone of the DNS name 
that is being updated. 
This request might include a list of prerequisites that must be fulfilled before the update can be 
completed. Types of prerequisites include the following: 
The resource record set exists. 
The resource record set does not exist. 
The name is in use. 
The name is not in use. 
4. The primary name server determines whether the prerequisites have been fulfilled. If they have, the 
primary DNS server performs the requested update. If they have not, the update fails. In either case, 
the primary DNS server replies to the client, indicating whether the update succeeded. 
If the DNS dynamic update is not successful, the DNS client records the event in the system event log. 
Configuring DNS Dynamic Update 
You configure DNS dynamic update behavior on DNS client computers running Windows, DNS servers 
running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003, and DHCP servers running Windows Server 
2008 or Windows Server 2003. 
To configure DNS dynamic update on a DNS client computer running Windows, do the following:
