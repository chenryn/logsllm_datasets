**Title: Black Hat USA 2019: Lessons and Lulz - The 5th Annual Black Hat USA NOC Report**

Returning with another year of insightful and sometimes bewildering statistics, the Black Hat Network Operations Center (NOC) team is excited to share the data that keeps us both puzzled and entertained. In this report, we will detail the tools and techniques we employ to set up, stabilize, and secure the network. We will also discuss the improvements and changes we have implemented over the past year to enhance our operations.

Additionally, we will highlight some of the more humorous and revealing network activities, providing a glimpse into how security professionals behave on an open WiFi network. Spoiler alert: The results are not always flattering. Our own behavior, it seems, often leaves much to be desired.
