User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Reducing IO caused by nginx I have a lot of free RAM but my IO is always 100 %util or very close. What ways can I reduce IO by using more RAM? My iotop shows nginx worker processes with the highest io rate. This is a file server serving files ranging from 1mb to 2gb. Here is my nginx.conf

#user  nobody;
worker_processes  32;
worker_rlimit_nofile 10240;
worker_rlimit_sigpending 32768;

error_log  logs/error.log  crit;

#pid        logs/nginx.pid;


events {
    worker_connections  51200;
}


http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    access_log  off;
    limit_conn_log_level info;
    log_format  xfs  '$arg_id|$arg_usr|$remote_addr|$body_bytes_sent|$status';

    sendfile       off;
    tcp_nopush     off;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    directio 4m;
    output_buffers 3 512k;
    reset_timedout_connection on;
    open_file_cache max=5000 inactive=20s;
    open_file_cache_valid    30s;
    open_file_cache_min_uses 2;
    open_file_cache_errors   on;
    client_body_buffer_size 32k;

    server_tokens off;
    autoindex off;

    keepalive_timeout  0;
    #keepalive_timeout  65;

Assistant: Please don't accept this answer as it's just one observation. But you use direct IO for files over 4M and only allow nginx 1.5MB of memory buffer for files.

directio 4m;
output_buffers 3 512k;


If I remember correctly then direct IO basically bypasses the file system IO cache to read directly from the HDD. So for files over 4M you use no memory to buffer the file and for files under 4M you use only 1.5M memory.
