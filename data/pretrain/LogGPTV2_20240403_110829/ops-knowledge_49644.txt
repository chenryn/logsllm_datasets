The provided system log consists of 20 lines, each containing a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and the log content. Here is a step-by-step summary of the log chunk:

1. **Session Expiration and Termination (August 18, 2015):**
   - At 16:09:30, the `ZooKeeperServer` expired session `0x14f1724a6e80011` due to a timeout of 10000ms.
   - The `PrepRequestProcessor` processed the termination of sessions with IDs `0x34f1724a35e000c` and `0x14f1724a6e8000d`.

2. **Client Session Establishment (August 20, 2015):**
   - At 13:12:40, a client attempted to establish a new session from IP `10.10.34.12:36322`.

3. **Further Session Expirations and Terminations:**
   - At 13:13:18, the `ZooKeeperServer` expired session `0x14f3fdae8ba0002` due to a timeout of 10000ms.
   - The `PrepRequestProcessor` processed the termination of session `0x14f3fdae8ba0001`.
   - At 17:12:28, the `ZooKeeperServer` expired session `0x24f3fdaf738000a` due to a timeout of 10000ms.

4. **Shutdown and Socket Connections:**
   - At 17:12:29, the `FinalRequestProcessor` completed the shutdown of the request processor.
   - At 17:12:45, the `NIOServerCnxnFactory` accepted a socket connection from `10.10.34.12:36358`.
   - A warning was logged at 17:12:45, indicating that the session `0x0` was closed due to a `java.io.IOException: ZooKeeperServer not running`.
   - At 17:13:23, the `NIOServerCnxn` closed a socket connection for client `10.10.34.12:36401` as no session was established.
   - Another warning was logged at 17:13:51, indicating that the session `0x0` was closed due to the same `IOException`.

5. **Leader Election Process:**
   - At 17:14:13, a warning was logged by the `Leader` component, indicating that the first value is `0x0`.
   - At 17:14:14, the `FastLeaderElection` component logged two notifications, both indicating the leader as `1`, zxid as `0xb0000007b`, round as `0x2`, state as `LOOKING`, sid as `1`, peerEpoch as `0xb`, and the current state as `LEADING`.

6. **Additional Session Expirations:**
   - At 17:14:24, the `ZooKeeperServer` expired multiple sessions (`0x14f3fdae8ba0017`, `0x14f3fdae8ba000c`, and `0x24f3fdaf7380008`) due to a timeout of 10000ms.
   - At 17:23:54, the `NIOServerCnxn` closed a socket connection for client `10.10.34.19:60483` which had session ID `0x24f4a631df90002`.
   - At 17:24:04, the `ZooKeeperServer` expired session `0x24f4a631df90002` due to a timeout of 10000ms.

**Summary:**
- The log primarily documents session expirations and terminations due to timeouts, client attempts to establish new sessions, and the FastLeaderElection process.
- There are also instances of socket connections being accepted and closed, with some warnings related to the `ZooKeeperServer` not running.
