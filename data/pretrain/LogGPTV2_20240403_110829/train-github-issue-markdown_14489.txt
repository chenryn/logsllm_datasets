The popover will not destroy properly while showing.
Here is a fiddle to demonstrate it: http://jsfiddle.net/vBUFu/20/ [edited].  
Hover over the button and wait 5sec to see what i mean.  
(I changed the opacity of the fade class so that the popover stays visible.)
The problem is that even with opacity 0, one cannot click on elements behind
it!
It works when its manually shown, but not with events like 'hover' or 'click'.
