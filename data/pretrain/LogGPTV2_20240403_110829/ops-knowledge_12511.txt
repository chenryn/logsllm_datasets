User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to disable ssh keys and log-in using password I'm having a tricky situation. First I set-up a ssh access through keys and I forgot password for "keys", and then I couldn't connect. I tried to login using another computer, and I thought I would login using username and password. 
But this is what I'm getting-

I was just wondering how could I disable using keys and login using "username" and "password" for ssh? Then I can clean everything...

Assistant: I don't think you can - you don't see password or keyboard-interactive in the 'Authentications that can continue' section.  You'll need to connect via the console and sort it out.  Your ssh Daemon is not allowing password authentication (i.e. not offering you the chance).
