#### Summary
The NFS mount point with `state=mounted` triggers an error if the mount is already mounted.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add an NFS mount stanza in a playbook.
2. Run the playbook when the mount is already mounted.

Example playbook snippet:
```yaml
- name: configure fstab for alpha
  mount:
    name: /srv/foo/alpha
    src: fileserver:/mdarchive/alpha
    fstype: nfs4
    opts: rw,hard,tcp,intr,nolock,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,_netdev
    state: mounted
```

3. Run the playbook and observe the error:
```plaintext
TASK [configure fstab for alpha] ***********************************************
fatal: [cluster-node01]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "Error mounting /srv/foo/alpha: mount.nfs4: /srv/foo/alpha is busy or already mounted\n"}
```

#### Expected Results
According to the documentation:
> If mounted or unmounted, the device will be actively mounted or unmounted as needed and appropriately configured in `fstab`.

If the mount is already mounted, it should not attempt to mount it again, and no error should occur. The playbook should continue executing without issues.

#### Actual Results
```plaintext
TASK [configure fstab for alpha] ***********************************************
fatal: [cluster-node01]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "Error mounting /srv/foo/alpha: mount.nfs4: /srv/foo/alpha is busy or already mounted\n"}
```
