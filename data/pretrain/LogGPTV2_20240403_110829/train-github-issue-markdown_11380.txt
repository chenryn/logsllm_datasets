I didn't find exactly this problem reported, only other bug reports related to
nfs mounts.
##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug report
##### COMPONENT NAME
mount module
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.0
      config file = /home/alex/repos/infra/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
Standard.
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
CentOS 7 -> CentOS 7  
Ubunt 15.10/16.04 -> CentOS 7  
CentOS 7 -> Ubuntu 15.10/16.04
In this particular case, only CentOS 7 -> CentOS 7
##### SUMMARY
NFS mount point with state=mounted triggers error if already mounted.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Put a NFS mount stanza in a playbook and run the playbook when the mount is
already mounted:
    - name: configure fstab for alpha
      action: mount name=/srv/foo/alpha src=fileserver:/mdarchive/alpha fstype=nfs4 opts=rw,hard,tcp,intr,nolock,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,_netdev state=mounted
Run the playbook, get an error:
    TASK [configure fstab for alpha] ***********************************************
    fatal: [cluster-node01]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "Error mounting /srv/foo/alpha: mount.nfs4: /srv/foo/alpha is busy or already mounted\n"}
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I expect the documented behaviour:  
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/mount_module.html
`If mounted or unmounted, the device will be actively mounted or unmounted as
needed and appropriately configured in fstab.`
Obviously, if a mount is already mounted, mounting it again is _not_ needed
and triggers the error and further execution of the playbook.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
    TASK [configure fstab for alpha] ***********************************************
    fatal: [cluster-node01]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "Error mounting /srv/foo/alpha: mount.nfs4: /srv/foo/alpha is busy or already mounted\n"}
