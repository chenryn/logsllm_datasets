Add ability to merge multiple lists/maps/sets that share the same id into a
map/list (through the use of flag).
Some frameworks require developers to provide a list of mapping location
(inside classpath). This would not be a problem if everything is bundled in a
war. But in modular deployment, we usually have the mapping files to be
packaged inside jars where they belong. This new improvement would remove the
responsibility to add every mapping file located in every new jar we deploy,
into the the a mapping list resides in the main context file of the
application.
For example:
JAR_A has a collectionContext.xml with a map/list with id "myList"  
JAR_B has a collectionContext.xml with a map/list with id "myList"  
WAR has an applicationContext.xml that imports
classpath*:**/collectionContext.xml
This feature would allow the two maps to be merged into a map with id
"myList".
