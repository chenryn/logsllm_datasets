## Abstract
This study quantifies the mechanisms and speed of internal censorship on popular Chinese microblogging sites, particularly Weibo, to comply with government requirements. Our analysis is based on 2.38 million posts gathered over approximately two months in 2012, focusing on "sensitive" users. This approach allows us to observe censorship events within minutes of their occurrence, though it skews our sample away from a random representation of the general Weibo population. Additionally, we analyzed a larger dataset of 470 million posts from Weibo's public timeline, which is more representative of a random sample.

We found that deletions are most frequent in the first hour after a post is submitted, with nearly 30% of total deletion events occurring within 5 to 30 minutes. Almost 90% of deletions happen within the first 24 hours. Our data also allowed us to test hypotheses about the mechanisms used by Weibo for censorship, such as keyword-based retrospective censorship and the interaction between repost/retweet popularity and censorship. We further used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify topics more likely to be censored.

## 1. Introduction
Measuring internet censorship is inherently biased due to the impracticality of testing every keyword or checking every post at small time intervals. In this paper, we describe our method for tracking censorship on Weibo, a popular microblogging platform in China, and the results of our measurements. Our system focuses on a core set of users who are interconnected through their social graph and tend to post about sensitive topics. This biases our sample towards content from these specific users but enables high-fidelity measurement of the speed and patterns of censorship.

Sina Weibo (referred to as "Weibo" in this paper) has the most active user community among microblog sites in China, with over 300 million users and approximately 100 million messages sent daily as of February 2012. Similar to Twitter, Weibo provides services such as @usernames, #hashtags, reposting, and URL shortening. It plays a significant role in the discourse surrounding current events in China, allowing both professional reporters and amateurs to provide immediate, first-hand accounts and opinions. Weibo limits posts to 140 characters, but this can convey significantly more information in Chinese than in English. It also supports embedded photos, videos, and comment threads.

China employs both backbone-level filtering of IP packets and higher-level filtering in software, such as blog platforms, chat programs, and search engines. Previous work on Weibo [2, 9] is discussed in more detail in Section 2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the speed of microblog post removal, measured in minutes after posting. This high-fidelity measurement allows us to not only accurately measure the speed of censorship but also to compare censorship speeds with respect to topics, censor methods, and other patterns.

Our results show that Weibo employs a "defense-in-depth" strategy for filtering content. Internet censorship represents a conflict between censors, who seek to filter content according to policy, and users who are subject to that censorship. Censorship can directly suppress conversations and chill future discussions through the threat of state surveillance. Our goal is to catalog the various mechanisms Weibo's censors employ.

## 2. Background
Since 2010, when microblogs debuted in China, social media has played a significant role in reporting and discussing top news stories. Events such as the Wukan protests, the Deng Yujiao incident, the Yao Jiaxin murder case, and the Shifang protest have been heavily influenced by social media. Social media has also forced the government to address issues directly, such as the Beijing rainstorms in July 2012.

Analyzing Chinese social media is challenging due to the lack of word boundary delimiters in written Chinese, the presence of unknown words like named entities and neologisms, and the rapid evolution of new terms. Despite these challenges, previous research has explored Weibo censorship. Bamman et al. [2] performed a statistical analysis of deleted posts, showing that the presence of certain sensitive terms increased the likelihood of deletion. Their work also revealed geographic patterns in post deletion, with higher rates in Tibet and Qinghai. WeiboScope [9] collects deleted posts from Weibo by following users with a high number of followers. In contrast, our strategy focuses on a core set of users with a high rate of post deletions, some with many followers and some with few. Previous studies measured deletion events with a resolution of hours or days, while our system detects deletion events within minutes.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Identifying the Sensitive User Group
To understand what Weibo targets for censorship and how quickly they do so, we developed a system to collect removed posts from targeted users in almost real time. Each IP address and API has a rate limit for accessing Weibo, forcing us to focus on users likely to be censored. We started with 25 sensitive users discovered manually using a list of banned keywords from China Digital Times [4]. We then broadened our search to include users who were frequently reposted by our initial group, adding those with more than five deleted posts to our pool of sensitive users. After 15 days, our sensitive group included 3,567 users, and we observed more than 4,500 post deletions daily, including about 1,500 "permission denied" deletions. Approximately 12% of the total posts from our sensitive users were eventually deleted.

### 3.2 Crawling
We followed our list of users with sufficient fidelity to see posts as they were made and measure how long they lasted before being deleted. Our target sampling resolution was one minute. We used two Weibo APIs to query individual user timelines and the public timeline. Starting in July 2012, we queried each of our 3,500 users once per minute, retrieving the most recent 50 posts. Deleted posts outside this window were not detected, potentially underestimating the number of older deletions. We also queried the public timeline roughly every four seconds, retrieving 200 recent posts. Half of these posts were 1-5 minutes old, and the other half were hours old. To overcome rate limits, we used approximately 300 concurrent Tor circuits driven from our research computing cluster. Our data was stored and processed on a four-node cluster using Hadoop and HBase.

### 3.3 Detecting Deletions
An absent post may have been censored or deleted for other reasons. We conducted empirical tests to distinguish different cases and concluded that we can detect two types of deletions:
- **General Deletion**: A "post does not exist" error indicates a user or system deletion.
- **System Deletion (Permission Denied)**: An error indicating the post still exists but has been flagged by a censorship event.

The ratio of system deletions to general deletions in our user timeline dataset is roughly 1:2. We focus on system deletions because they are exclusively the result of censorship. Our crawler, which repeatedly fetches each sensitive user's personal timeline, can detect a censorship event within 1-2 minutes of its occurrence.

## 4. Timing of Censorship
For easier explanation, we define the following:
- **Repost**: A post that is a copy of another post.
- **Child Post**: A repost of another post.
- **Parent Post**: The original post that is being reposted.
- **Regular Post**: A post that is not a repost.

From July 20, 2012, to September 8, 2012, we collected 2.38 million user timeline posts, with a 12.8% total deletion rate (4.5% for system deletions and 8.3% for general deletions). Note that this deletion rate is specific to our users and not representative of Weibo as a whole. We found that 82% of the total deletions were child posts, and 75% of the total deletions had pictures either in themselves or in their parent post.

## 5. Natural Language Processing
Using NLP techniques, we analyzed the topics of deleted posts and compared the deletion speeds for different topics. We found that the topics with the fastest mass removal were often hot topics on Weibo, such as the Beijing rainstorms or a sex scandal. Our sensitive user group also had overarching themes throughout all topics, suggesting discussion of state power (e.g., Beijing, government, China, and the police).

## 6. Conclusion
This research contributes to the understanding of Weibo's censorship mechanisms by providing a high-fidelity method to detect censorship events within minutes. We propose and test several hypotheses about the mechanisms used by Weibo, such as keyword-based censorship and the interaction between repost/retweet popularity and censorship. Our findings highlight the distributed, defense-in-depth strategy employed by Weibo to remove sensitive content. Future work will focus on disseminating real-time results and regular summaries.
