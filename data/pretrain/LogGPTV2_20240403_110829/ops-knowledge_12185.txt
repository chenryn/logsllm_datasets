To effectively implement CIS Control 7.4, which focuses on performing automated application patch management, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Establish a Patch Management Policy**: Develop and document a comprehensive patch management policy that outlines the frequency, scope, and responsibilities for applying patches to all enterprise applications.

2. **Automate Patch Deployment**: Utilize automated tools and systems to regularly deploy updates and patches to all relevant applications. This should be done at least monthly, or more frequently if critical vulnerabilities are identified.

3. **Prioritize Critical Patches**: Prioritize the deployment of patches based on the severity and potential impact of the vulnerabilities they address. Ensure that critical and high-severity patches are applied as soon as possible.

4. **Test Patches in a Controlled Environment**: Before deploying patches to production environments, test them in a controlled, isolated environment to ensure they do not introduce new issues or conflicts with existing systems.

5. **Monitor and Report**: Continuously monitor the patching process and maintain detailed records of all patch deployments. Regularly report on the status of patch management activities to relevant stakeholders.

6. **Review and Update the Policy**: Periodically review and update the patch management policy to reflect changes in the organizationâ€™s IT environment, emerging threats, and best practices.

By following these procedures, organizations can ensure that their applications remain up-to-date and protected against known vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing overall security and compliance.
