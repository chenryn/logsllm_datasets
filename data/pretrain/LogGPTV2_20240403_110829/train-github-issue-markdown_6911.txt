**Current behavior**
I am trying to activate a child aux route. Here is the routing config:
    export const routes: Routes = [
      {
        path: '',
        children: [
          { path: '', redirectTo: 'component-one', pathMatch: 'full' },
          { path: 'component-one', component: ComponentOne },
          { path: 'component-two', component: ComponentTwo }
          { path: 'component-aux', component: ComponentAux, outlet: 'sidebar' }
        ]
      }
    ];
When I try to navigate to `/component-one(outlet:component-aux)` I get `Cannot
match any routes: 'component-aux'`.
**Expected behavior**
Navigate to that route without any errors.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
  1. Go to https://plnkr.co/edit/jVjS8tRSLbhpTO9qRxll?p=preview
  2. Click the 'navigate' button
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
This looks as a valid routing configuration that should be supported.
