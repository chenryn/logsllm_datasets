to load balancing, server errors, and browsers (along with common applications
like Facebook). For mobile, we found mobile network operators like AT&T,
Sprint, and Verizon were common keywords. After issues faced by users, top-
ics tend to be related to more operational issues such as congestion, packet loss,
and routing. Issues related to attacks, censorship, natural disasters, and power
outages are less common.
Dominant entities are access, ISP and mobile networks. Figure 4 high-
lights the prevalence of ISPs, access networks and mobile networks as entities
involved in the outages. Overall, errors in application-speciﬁc entities like CDNs,
e-mail, cloud and content providers were less prevalent in the mailing list dis-
cussions. Keywords in the access category tended to include access network
providers like Verizon, Comcast, and Time Warner as well as issues like latency,
time outs, and ﬁber cuts.
Content and mobile issues are on the rise. Figure 5 shows the breakdown
of topics by year for outage and entity types, respectively. Starting in 2009 we see
the emergence of Content providers as an entity that is commonly discussed in
the mailing list. That same year we begin to see more posts related to application
misconﬁgurations. We also observe a corresponding increase in issues related to
mobile data.
Correlating keywords and associated outage types. We revisit some of
the keywords observed in Fig. 2 and consider the top outage types for threads
containing these keywords in Table 4. We consider keywords related to speciﬁc
entities in three broad classes: ISP (Level 3), content provider (Facebook), and
mobile ISP (AT&T). We ﬁnd that threads containing Level 3 (and other ISPs we
consider), tend to relate to operational issues for the network such as congestion,
packet loss and routing incidents. In contrast, Facebook and AT&T tend to be
discussed in relation to application server/misconﬁguration issues and mobile
data network issues. Interestingly, we also observe Facebook in threads related
to mobile data network issues, possibly related to mobile users having trouble
reaching the site. Similarly, AT&T is mentioned in threads related to application

misconﬁgurations e.g., application speciﬁc CDN conﬁgurations that may impact
users on a speciﬁc ISP.
High impact events. Finally, we investigate two incidents which explain spikes
in posting in 2012. Among threads with the longest duration and most replies, are
those related to a series of large-scale DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS attacks in Sep-
tember 2012 [1,3]. Threads related to the issue reported performance problems in
DNS servers that, as a result of misconﬁguration, were acting as open resolvers.
These servers were inadvertently ﬂooding targets with large DNS responses,
which in turn degraded performance for legitimate DNS queries [40].
Another spike in activity is related to a widespread outage in late October
2012, experienced by users of Windstream, a large ISP in the United States.
Users in multiple areas (mainly in the north and northeastern US) experienced
outages due to a ﬁber-cut caused by Hurricane Sandy [45]. Many outages around
that time–related to Hurricane Sandy–also contributed to the increase in mailing
list activity during fall 2012 [15]. We manually veriﬁed that these high-impact
events were correctly classiﬁed by the machine learning method in terms of both
the type of outage and the entities involved.

Intradomain reliability. Network reliability has been considered in a variety
of networks ranging from an academic WAN [43] and ISPs [32,47] to data cen-
ters [22,39] using a variety of data sources. Some monitor properties of intrado-
main routing protocol such as OSPF Link State Advertisements (LSAs), which
can indicate instability or unavailability of network links, or IS-IS messages which
require specialized infrastructure for monitoring. More recently, there has been
interest in using syslog–which is ubiquitous in many networks–to infer and study
network failures. Because these studies rely on protocol and logging messages to
infer the state of the network, they have a hard time inferring real user impact.
Further, in many cases the network is an important part of the business which
makes revealing failures unattractive.
Interdomain reliability. A variety of techniques have been employed to under-
stand reliability at the interdomain level, including ongoing probing and mon-
itoring eﬀorts [26] and crowdsourcing measurements from a large population
of P2P users [13]. However, characterization of the Internet’s reliability at this
Internet Outages, the Eyewitness Accounts
217
level has been hindered by the limited view of the system provided by publicly
available datasets (e.g., BGP feeds).
Application layer and user-reported reliability. Network level failures do
not always imply application layer or user-observed impact. There have been
some studies that speciﬁcally try to address this using diﬀerent techniques. Web
application reliability was measured by monitoring Web client connections [33]
to determine if failures were primarily client or server-related. Netmedic [25]
analyzes correlations between application servers that fail in an enterprise net-
work to understand root cause. In the context of cloud computing, Benson et al.
attempt to mine threads from customer forums of an IaaS cloud provider [7] to
identify problems users face when using cloud computing. This work is similar
to our own in that it attempts to gather data from naturally arising user discus-
sions, however, their work takes a more focused view considering only failures of
a speciﬁc cloud provider.
Concurrently to our study, Dimitropoulos and Djatmiko also recognized the
potential of mailing lists as a dataset [16]. However, their analysis is orthogonal
to ours, which focuses more on how to apply NLP to exploit the semantics of
these datasets and understand them at-scale.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we explore an operator-run mailing list to understand reliability
issues spanning multiple networks over a period of 7 years. Our main observations
are that the list is primarily used for discussing issues raised by users (e.g.,
application and mobile data issues) and that content services are on the rise in
terms of discussion threads.
The mailing list data presents only one of many natural language resources
that can be used to understand network reliability and the methodology applied
in this paper will hopefully inspire further analysis of natural language network
datasets (e.g., forums [7] and trouble shooting tickets [12]) and mailing lists
such as NANOG. Text-based analysis may also be combined with empirical
troubleshooting approaches (e.g., Hubble [26], LIFEGUARD [27]) to provide a
more complete view of network reliability when directly measured data is scarce,
incomplete, or unavailable.
