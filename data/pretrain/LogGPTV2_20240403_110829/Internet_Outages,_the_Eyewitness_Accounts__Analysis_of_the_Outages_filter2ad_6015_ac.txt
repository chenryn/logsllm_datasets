# Internet Outages: Eyewitness Accounts

## Introduction
This paper examines the content of an operator-run mailing list to understand reliability issues across multiple networks over a seven-year period. The primary focus is on user-reported issues, such as application and mobile data problems, and the increasing prominence of content services in discussion threads.

## Classification of Threads
### Types of Outages
- **Type of Outage**: 
  - Content
  - Email
  - ISP (Internet Service Provider)
  - Mobile
- **Entities Involved**:
  - Access Networks
  - ISPs
  - Mobile Networks

### Figure 4: Distribution of Thread Classifications
- **Figure 4** highlights the prevalence of ISPs, access networks, and mobile networks as entities involved in outages.
- Errors in application-specific entities like CDNs, email, cloud, and content providers were less common.

### Keywords and Entities
- **Access Networks**: Keywords include providers like Verizon, Comcast, and Time Warner, and issues like latency, timeouts, and fiber cuts.
- **Mobile Networks**: Common keywords are mobile network operators like AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon.
- **Operational Issues**: Topics related to congestion, packet loss, and routing are more frequent compared to attacks, censorship, natural disasters, and power outages.

## Trends Over Time
### Figure 5: Breakdown of Topics by Year
- **Content Providers**: Emerged as a commonly discussed entity starting in 2009.
- **Application Misconfigurations**: Increased in 2009, along with issues related to mobile data.

### Correlation Between Keywords and Outage Types
- **Table 4** shows the top outage types for threads containing specific keywords:
  - **ISP (Level 3)**: Operational issues like congestion, packet loss, and routing incidents.
  - **Content Provider (Facebook)**: Application server/misconfiguration issues and mobile data network issues.
  - **Mobile ISP (AT&T)**: Application server/misconfiguration issues and mobile data network issues.

## High-Impact Events
### DNS Amplification DDoS Attacks (September 2012)
- **Issue**: Large-scale DNS amplification DDoS attacks.
- **Impact**: Performance problems in DNS servers acting as open resolvers, leading to degraded performance for legitimate DNS queries.

### Hurricane Sandy (October 2012)
- **Issue**: Widespread outages experienced by Windstream users due to a fiber-cut caused by Hurricane Sandy.
- **Impact**: Users in the north and northeastern US experienced outages, contributing to increased mailing list activity.

## Related Work
### Intradomain Reliability
- **Networks Studied**: Academic WANs, ISPs, and data centers.
- **Data Sources**: OSPF Link State Advertisements (LSAs), IS-IS messages, and syslog.
- **Challenges**: Inferring real user impact and reluctance to reveal failures due to business concerns.

### Interdomain Reliability
- **Techniques**: Probing, monitoring, and crowdsourcing from P2P users.
- **Challenges**: Limited view provided by publicly available datasets (e.g., BGP feeds).

### Application Layer and User-Reported Reliability
- **Studies**: Web application reliability, Netmedic, and mining customer forums of IaaS cloud providers.
- **Similar Work**: Benson et al. [7] focused on a specific cloud provider, while Dimitropoulos and Djatmiko [16] analyzed NANOG and outages mailing lists.

## Conclusions
- **Main Observations**: The mailing list is primarily used for discussing user-raised issues, and content services are becoming more prominent.
- **Future Directions**: Text-based analysis can be combined with empirical troubleshooting approaches to provide a more comprehensive view of network reliability.

## References
- A detailed list of references is provided, including academic papers, technical reports, and online articles.
