### Virtual Machine Scale Set Controls

| Control | Description & Rationale | Severity | Automated | Fix Script Available |
|---------|-------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Log Analytics Agent Installation** | Installing the Log Analytics extension for Windows and Linux allows Azure Monitor to collect data from your Azure VM Scale Sets, which can be used for detailed analysis and correlation of events. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Antimalware with Real-Time Protection** | Enabling antimalware protection minimizes the risks from existing and new attacks from various types of malware. Microsoft Antimalware provides real-time protection, scheduled scanning, malware remediation, signature updates, engine updates, sample reporting, and exclusion event collection. | High | Yes | No |
| **Diagnostics Enablement** | Diagnostics logs are necessary for creating activity trails while investigating an incident or a compromise. The IaaS Diagnostics extension should be enabled on Windows, and the Linux Diagnostics extension on Linux. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Disk Encryption** | Using this feature ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest, minimizing the risk of data loss from physical theft and helping meet regulatory compliance requirements. Both OS and data disks in a VM Scale Set may contain sensitive information, so disk encryption must be enabled for both. | High | Yes | No |
| **VM Up-to-Date with Latest Scale Set Model** | All security configurations applied to a VM Scale Set will only be effective if all individual VM instances in the Scale Set are up-to-date with the latest overall Scale Set model. | High | Yes | No |
| **Minimum Required Permissions via RBAC** | Granting minimum access using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that users have just enough permissions to perform their tasks, minimizing the exposure of resources in case of user or service account compromise. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Careful Review of Public IPs** | Public IPs provide direct internet access, exposing VMSS instances to potential attacks over the public network. Each public IP on a VMSS instance must be carefully reviewed. | High | Yes | No |
| **NSG Configuration** | Restricting inbound and outbound traffic via Network Security Groups (NSGs) limits the network exposure of a VM Scale Set by reducing the attack surface. | Medium | Yes | No |
| **Management Ports Closed** | Open remote management ports expose a VMSS instance to a high level of risk from internet-based attacks that attempt to brute-force credentials to gain admin access. | High | Yes | No |

This table provides a clear and structured overview of the controls, their descriptions, severities, and whether they can be automated and fixed with a script.
