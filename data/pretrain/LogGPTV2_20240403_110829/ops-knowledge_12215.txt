Question: "Why is the AuthToken HMAC key regenerated on every boot of a device within the Android operating system, and not persisted across reboots?"
 "A": "To maintain the high performance of the device by resetting the cryptographic components to their default state."
 "B": "To prevent replay attacks by ensuring a unique HMAC key is used in each session that is never made available outside the TEE."
 "C": "Because the TEE lacks persistent storage capabilities and cannot retain the HMAC key across reboots."
 "D": "To comply with user privacy regulations that mandate the periodic reset of all security-related keys."
