perform a gesture differently, it can also serve as a form
of authentication and thus be used to identify a person
and their relationship. Furthermore, the proximity of a
wearable device is helpful in identifying several contex-
tual factors, including user location and nearby people.
From a false positive/negative perspective, biometrics re-
quire quite a bit of tuning that can affect an owner’s
choice of using this method, especially when authenti-
cating high-access spouses or for operating dangerous
equipment like lawn mowers.
Voice assistants are increasingly ubiquitous in homes.
Although such assistants can perform speaker identiﬁ-
cation (e.g., Google Home Voice Match), they are cur-

rently used as a personalization hint rather than a se-
curity boundary. However, future versions that use
additional hardware might be useful in determining a
speaker’s identity and relationship for access-control
purposes [12]. Such assistants could help identify con-
textual factors like the location of a user or the pres-
ence of nearby people (e.g., a supervising adult near chil-
dren). From the perspective of false positives/negatives,
any voice-based method will require tuning. Audio is
especially sensitive to background noise. Audio authen-
tication also introduces privacy issues, as well as the po-
tential for eavesdropping and replay attacks.
Advances in computer vision can also be leveraged
to identify users, their relationship, and their location
within a home with cameras. However, it is possible
for computer vision systems to falsely identify individ-
uals or confuse identities. Thus, some level of false pos-
itive/negative tuning will be required, especially when
a household is expected to have many temporary occu-
pants. A big downside of this mechanism is the pri-
vacy risk—cameras can track home activity at a high
level of granularity. However, some of the privacy issues
could potentially be alleviated using local processing or
privacy-preserving vision algorithms [21].
Bilateral or continuous authentication mechanisms
embody the idea that a user has to be: (a) physically
present, and (b) currently using the device [20,28]. Such
mechanisms are readily able to identify users and re-
lationships, and to support contextual factors involv-
ing user presence. False positive/negative tuning varies
based on the speciﬁc instantiation.
If a wearable de-
vice with a continuous authentication algorithm is used,
then the false positive/negative rates must be considered.
Privacy concerns can be alleviated if this mechanism is
implemented in a decentralized manner—only the user’s
proxy device and the target device are involved in estab-
lishing an authenticated channel. It can also provide a
simple solution to the de-authentication problem (revok-
ing access if a temporary visitor is no longer welcome).
In sum, we have taken initial steps toward reenvision-
ing access-control speciﬁcation and authentication in the
home IoT. Much work remains in continuing to translate
these observations to fully usable prototypes, as well as
in supporting ever richer capabilities and interactions.
