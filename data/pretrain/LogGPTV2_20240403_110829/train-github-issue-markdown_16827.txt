When porting an Android application to Flutter, I noticed that my `drawable-xxhdpi` folder on the Android side contains a significant number of assets.

Manually declaring each of these assets in the `pubspec.yaml` file would be cumbersome. It would be more efficient if Flutter allowed me to simply specify a folder, or if there were a standardized "assets" folder where I could place all my images. This would streamline the process and reduce the overhead of asset management.
