we followed standard procedures to apply a modest weighting
adjustment to each respondent so that the samples in each
country were more representative.
All participants were paid, with incentives differing by panel
and by country, often through point systems which can be ex-
changed for products or gift cards through vendor partnerships,
at an industry-standard amount within their market.
Respondent demographics. In aggregate, across all countries
and years: 53% of participants identiﬁed as men; 47% as
women; and due to the use of this question for stratiﬁcation,
we were unable to collect gender beyond binary. For age,
overall, our sample is largely representative of the online
populations in these countries. Aggregated: 15% 18–24; 29%
25–34; 23% 35–44; 15% 45–54; 11% 55–65; and 6% over 65.
The sample is somewhat skewed to high educated participants,
with 75% having some college education or higher; 25%
have secondary education or lower. Regarding sexuality: 82%
identiﬁed as heterosexual; 11% preferred not to say; and 7%
were LGBTQ+. For full details by country, see the Appendix
Table V.
B. Estimating Prevalence and Growth
We present a breakdown of prevalent online hate and
harassment experiences reported by participants in Table II.

Indonesia, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or Russia; for a complete list of
countries excluded, see the Appendix Table V.

TABLE II: Frequency that participants reported experiencing hate and harassment online. We compare our results against previous surveys.
We denote questions where the framing exactly matches a previous PEW survey with a dagger †. Our question framing differs from the
other listed surveys, though the abuse mechanisms studied overlap.
Globally, an average of 48% of people across the 22 countries
we surveyed reported experiencing some form of hate and
harassment.5 In line with a previous survey by Pew [118], we
split experiences into a “moderate” category to indicate less
severe forms of harassment with respect to harms or intensity,
and “severe” to indicate extreme forms of harassment. Table II
details the attacks that fall into each category. Of participants,
40% reported moderate experiences of hate and harassment,
and 25% reported severe experiences, most frequently stalking
(7%), account hijacking by someone the participant knew
(6%), and sexual harassment (6%).
Many moderate hate and harassment experiences reported
were brief and isolated incidents. Just 11% of participants who
reported moderate harassment also reported being harassed or
bullied for a sustained period. Another 58% never reported any
form of severe hate or harassment. We also ﬁnd that experi-
ences with hate and harassment are often isolated to just one
or two distinct experiences (e.g., stalking, sexual harassment).
Of participants that encountered any hate and harassment, 43%
reported experiencing only one type of attack, and 65% two
or fewer. Restricting our analysis to those that reported severe
hate and harassment, 85% of participants reported two or fewer
types of attacks. This observation is critical when designing
solutions for targets of hate and harassment as experiences are
varied and non-overlapping.
Growth over time. For the 12 countries with data from both
2016 and 2018, participants reporting hate and harassment
increased from 45% to 49% (p < 0.0001). The largest
statistically signiﬁcant growth (p < 0.0001) was in France
(41% increase), Germany (41% increase), and the UK (38%
5When calculating global averages, we ﬁrst calculate the weighted mean per
country over 2016–2018 to account for underrepresented demographics, and
then calculate the mean across every country. This approach avoids under-
representing any one country due to uneven sample sizes, such as when a
country like Spain or Saudi Arabia is not present every year of the survey.
increase). To discount other potential explanations for this
growth (e.g.,
increasing social media usage, or changing
demographics in the region), we modeled the outcome of
experiencing any form of hate and harassment as a binomial
distribution Yi ∼ B(ni, πi) using a logarithmic link function.
The model’s parameters consist of categorical variables related
to a participant’s age, gender, and country of residence;
and whether the participant self-identiﬁed as LGBTQ+, how
frequently the participant reported using social media, and the
year the survey was conducted.6 Table III shows our results,
with more detailed model parameters and signiﬁcance testing
available in the Appendix. Holding all variables other than
time constant, we ﬁnd that the odds of experiencing abuse
in 2018 were 1.30 times higher than in 2016 (p < 0.0001).
This shows that demographic shifts and changing social media
usage alone cannot account for the increase in harassment year
over year. Instead, incidents of hate and harassment continue
to grow, suggesting that existing solutions are failing to stem
its rise.
Comparison with other estimates. Of the other existing
survey instruments that measure hate and harassment, only
Microsoft’s Digital Civility Index (DCI) tracks global expe-
riences in a distinct set of 22 countries [110]. Their survey
found 40% of participants reported “behavioral risks” such as
bullying, stalking, and physical threats; and another 34% some
form of “sexual risk” such as unwanted explicit content and
unwanted attempts to form romantic partnerships. For attacks
that overlap in both our survey and the DCI survey, we ﬁnd
similar rates as shown in Table II.
If we narrow our focus to only the US—the same as
Pew [118], Data and Society (DS)
[44], and the Anti-
Defamation League (ADL) [4]—we ﬁnd participants in our
6When building this model, we excluded countries where we did not collect
LGBTQ+ information.

survey reported roughly half the likelihood of speciﬁc attacks
compared to these prior surveys. This holds even when the
survey item terminology such as “been called offensive names”
or “been physically threatened” were constant across survey
instruments. Our results may be a conservative estimate, with
rates that seem low and include a broader spectrum of the US
population, while the ADL results should be read as an upper
bound. Our rates of overall abuse compare similarly to Pew
and DS, but more work is needed to better understand how
the population interprets these concerns, questions of priming
in the survey design, and the evolution of the threat over time
to better estimate hate and harassment.
C. Identifying at-risk demographics
The self-reported demographics provided by participant sug-
gest that LGBTQ+ populations, young adults, and active social
media users are far more likely to report experiencing hate
and harassment than other demographic groups (Table IV).
These variations persist, even when holding all other explana-
tory variables constant as captured by our earlier model in
Table III. We only discuss statistically signiﬁcant variations
where p < 0.0001.
Gender. Men in our survey reported slightly elevated rates
of online hate and harassment compared to women (49% vs.
46%), though both genders reported similar rates of severe
abuse. In particular, men were more likely to report being
physically threatened (45% increase vs. women) and being
called offensive names (26% increase). Women were more
likely to report sexual harassment (114% increase vs. men)
and stalking (41% increase). This stratiﬁcation of experiences
between men and women was also reported by other survey
instruments [44], [106], [110], [118]. These results highlight
that it is critical to avoid potential stereotypes of who faces
harassment online, and that experiences differ across genders.
LGBTQ+. Of participants who self-identiﬁed as LGBTQ+
across the 15 countries where we collected such information,
60% reported experiencing some form of online hate and
harassment, compared to 41% for non-LGBTQ+ participants
(47% increase). Severe forms of harassment were especially
pernicious among LGBTQ+ participants (85% increase vs.
non-LGBTQ+). The top three heightened threats included
sexual harassment (173% increase vs. non-LGBTQ+),
the
leakage of private photos to embarrass the participant (154%
increase), and being harassed or bullied for a sustained period
(118% increase). This elevated risk holds across ages, genders,
and other factors as highlighted in Table III, where the odds of
experiencing harassment increase by 1.86 times for LGBTQ+
people (p < 0.0001). Similar to our results, Data and Society
found that LGBTQ+ people were more likely to face 18 of
the 20 types of harassment they surveyed (the exceptions
being account hijacking, which overlaps with cybercrime,
and tracking, which overlaps with advertising) [44]. As such,
LGBTQ+ populations represent a unique at-risk group that
needs additional attention when designing potential solutions.
Age. We ﬁnd that young adults aged 18–24 as well as par-
ticipants aged 25–44 reported higher rates of any harassment
(60% and 53%) compared to participants aged 45 and older
(35%). In particular, participants aged 18–24 reported higher
rates of sexual harassment (200% increase vs. ages 45+), the
leakage of private photos to embarrass the participant (182%
increase), and sustained harassment (162% increase). This
heightened risk persists even when holding all other factors
constant, with the odds of harassment increasing by 3.99 times
(p < 0.0001) compared to participants aged 65 and older
(Table III). These odds decrease steadily as a function of age,
indicating a potential gap between the behaviors of young
people online compared to older generations. Both Pew and
Data and Society also found that people under 30 in the United
States were far more likely to report hate and harassment [44],
[118].
Social media usage. Social media usage was pervasive among
the countries we surveyed: 73% of participants reported daily
usage and another 12% weekly usage. Just 9% of participants
self-reported never using social media. We ﬁnd the most active
social media users experience heightened levels of hate and
harassment, with 50% of daily users experiencing harassment,
compared to 25% of participants who never use social media.
The largest increase in risk was associated with the leakage
of private photos to embarrass the participant (251% increase
vs. non-social media users). This higher incident rate of
harassment holds across all levels of social media activity,
even when taking into account all other explanatory variables
(Table III). A related survey by the Anti-Defamation League
found that, of daily social media users on different platforms,
47% of Twitch users (a video gaming community) reported
experiencing harassment on the platform, compared to 38%
of Reddit users, and 37% of Facebook users [4]. The lowest
incident rate reported was for YouTube, at 15%. These results
highlight that social media platforms in particular can poten-
tially have an out-sized role in tackling hate and harassment
online. Likewise, the design or audience of a platform can
heavily inﬂuence interactions between people, as we discuss
