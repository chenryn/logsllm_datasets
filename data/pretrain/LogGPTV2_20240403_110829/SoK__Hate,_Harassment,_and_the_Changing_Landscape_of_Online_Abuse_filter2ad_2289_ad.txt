We adhered to standard procedures, applying a modest weighting adjustment to each respondent to ensure that the samples in each country were more representative. All participants received compensation, with incentives varying by panel and country, often through point systems that could be exchanged for products or gift cards via vendor partnerships, at an industry-standard amount within their respective markets.

### Respondent Demographics
In aggregate, across all countries and years:
- **Gender**: 53% of participants identified as men; 47% as women. Due to the use of this question for stratification, we were unable to collect data on non-binary gender identities.
- **Age**: Our sample is largely representative of the online populations in these countries. The age distribution is as follows: 15% (18–24), 29% (25–34), 23% (35–44), 15% (45–54), 11% (55–65), and 6% (over 65).
- **Education**: The sample is somewhat skewed towards higher education, with 75% of participants having some college education or higher, and 25% having secondary education or lower.
- **Sexuality**: 82% identified as heterosexual; 11% preferred not to say; and 7% identified as LGBTQ+.

**Note**: Questions where the framing exactly matches a previous Pew survey are denoted with a dagger (†). While our question framing differs from other listed surveys, the abuse mechanisms studied overlap.

Globally, an average of 48% of people across the 22 countries surveyed reported experiencing some form of hate and harassment. We categorized these experiences into "moderate" (less severe forms of harassment) and "severe" (extreme forms of harassment). Table II details the attacks that fall into each category. Specifically, 40% of participants reported moderate experiences, and 25% reported severe experiences, with the most frequent being stalking (7%), account hijacking by someone known (6%), and sexual harassment (6%).

Many moderate hate and harassment experiences were brief and isolated incidents. Only 11% of participants who reported moderate harassment also reported being harassed or bullied for a sustained period. Additionally, 58% never reported any form of severe hate or harassment. Experiences with hate and harassment are often limited to one or two distinct types. Of participants who encountered any hate and harassment, 43% experienced only one type of attack, and 65% experienced two or fewer. Among those who reported severe hate and harassment, 85% experienced two or fewer types of attacks. This observation is crucial for designing solutions, as experiences are varied and non-overlapping.

**Growth over time**: For the 12 countries with data from both 2016 and 2018, the percentage of participants reporting hate and harassment increased from 45% to 49% (p < 0.0001). The largest statistically significant growth (p < 0.0001) was observed in France (41% increase), Germany (41% increase), and the UK (38% increase).

To discount other potential explanations for this growth (e.g., increasing social media usage or changing demographics), we modeled the outcome of experiencing any form of hate and harassment as a binomial distribution \( Y_i \sim B(n_i, \pi_i) \) using a logarithmic link function. The model's parameters include categorical variables related to a participant’s age, gender, and country of residence; whether the participant self-identified as LGBTQ+; how frequently they used social media; and the year the survey was conducted. Table III shows our results, with more detailed model parameters and significance testing available in the Appendix. Holding all variables other than time constant, we found that the odds of experiencing abuse in 2018 were 1.30 times higher than in 2016 (p < 0.0001). This indicates that demographic shifts and changing social media usage alone cannot account for the increase in harassment year over year. Instead, incidents of hate and harassment continue to grow, suggesting that existing solutions are failing to stem the rise.

**Comparison with other estimates**: Of the other existing survey instruments that measure hate and harassment, only Microsoft’s Digital Civility Index (DCI) tracks global experiences in a distinct set of 22 countries. Their survey found 40% of participants reported “behavioral risks” such as bullying, stalking, and physical threats; and another 34% some form of “sexual risk” such as unwanted explicit content and unwanted attempts to form romantic partnerships. For overlapping attacks in both our survey and the DCI survey, we find similar rates as shown in Table II.

If we focus on the US, which is the same as Pew, Data and Society (DS), and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), we find that participants in our survey reported roughly half the likelihood of specific attacks compared to these prior surveys. This holds even when the survey item terminology, such as “been called offensive names” or “been physically threatened,” was consistent across survey instruments. Our results may be a conservative estimate, with rates that seem low and include a broader spectrum of the US population, while the ADL results should be read as an upper bound. Our rates of overall abuse compare similarly to Pew and DS, but more work is needed to better understand how the population interprets these concerns, questions of priming in the survey design, and the evolution of the threat over time to better estimate hate and harassment.

### Identifying at-risk demographics
The self-reported demographics suggest that LGBTQ+ populations, young adults, and active social media users are far more likely to report experiencing hate and harassment than other demographic groups (Table IV). These variations persist even when holding all other explanatory variables constant, as captured by our earlier model in Table III. We only discuss statistically significant variations where p < 0.0001.

**Gender**: Men in our survey reported slightly elevated rates of online hate and harassment compared to women (49% vs. 46%). Both genders reported similar rates of severe abuse. Specifically, men were more likely to report being physically threatened (45% increase vs. women) and being called offensive names (26% increase). Women were more likely to report sexual harassment (114% increase vs. men) and stalking (41% increase). This stratification of experiences between men and women was also reported by other survey instruments. These results highlight the importance of avoiding potential stereotypes of who faces harassment online and that experiences differ across genders.

**LGBTQ+**: Of participants who self-identified as LGBTQ+ across the 15 countries where we collected such information, 60% reported experiencing some form of online hate and harassment, compared to 41% for non-LGBTQ+ participants (47% increase). Severe forms of harassment were especially pernicious among LGBTQ+ participants (85% increase vs. non-LGBTQ+). The top three heightened threats included sexual harassment (173% increase vs. non-LGBTQ+), the leakage of private photos to embarrass the participant (154% increase), and being harassed or bullied for a sustained period (118% increase). This elevated risk holds across ages, genders, and other factors, as highlighted in Table III, where the odds of experiencing harassment increase by 1.86 times for LGBTQ+ people (p < 0.0001). Similar to our results, Data and Society found that LGBTQ+ people were more likely to face 18 of the 20 types of harassment they surveyed. As such, LGBTQ+ populations represent a unique at-risk group that needs additional attention when designing potential solutions.

**Age**: We find that young adults aged 18–24, as well as participants aged 25–44, reported higher rates of any harassment (60% and 53%) compared to participants aged 45 and older (35%). Specifically, participants aged 18–24 reported higher rates of sexual harassment (200% increase vs. ages 45+), the leakage of private photos to embarrass the participant (182% increase), and sustained harassment (162% increase). This heightened risk persists even when holding all other factors constant, with the odds of harassment increasing by 3.99 times (p < 0.0001) compared to participants aged 65 and older (Table III). These odds decrease steadily as a function of age, indicating a potential gap between the behaviors of young people online compared to older generations. Both Pew and Data and Society also found that people under 30 in the United States were far more likely to report hate and harassment.

**Social media usage**: Social media usage was pervasive among the countries we surveyed: 73% of participants reported daily usage, and another 12% weekly usage. Just 9% of participants self-reported never using social media. We find that the most active social media users experience heightened levels of hate and harassment, with 50% of daily users experiencing harassment, compared to 25% of participants who never use social media. The largest increase in risk was associated with the leakage of private photos to embarrass the participant (251% increase vs. non-social media users). This higher incident rate of harassment holds across all levels of social media activity, even when taking into account all other explanatory variables (Table III). A related survey by the Anti-Defamation League found that, of daily social media users on different platforms, 47% of Twitch users (a video gaming community) reported experiencing harassment on the platform, compared to 38% of Reddit users and 37% of Facebook users. The lowest incident rate reported was for YouTube, at 15%. These results highlight that social media platforms can potentially have an outsized role in tackling hate and harassment online. The design or audience of a platform can heavily influence interactions between people, as we discuss further in the following sections.
