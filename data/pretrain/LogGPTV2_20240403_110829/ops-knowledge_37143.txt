User: I would like to execute multiple commands in a row:
i.e. (just to illustrate my need):
cmd (the shell)
then
cd dir
and
ls
and read the result of the ls.
Any idea with subprocess module?
Update:
cd dir and ls are just an example. I need to run complex commands (following a particular order, without any pipelining). In fact, I would like one subprocess shell and the ability to launch many commands on it.
Assistant: To do that, you would have to:

supply the shell=True argument in the subprocess.Popen call, and
separate the commands with:


; if running under a *nix shell (bash, ash, sh, ksh, csh, tcsh, zsh etc)
& if running under the cmd.exe of Windows
