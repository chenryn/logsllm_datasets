the average redundancy percentage was 16% using 400MB packet
store, meaning that the ratio of the total size of the matched regions
in all packets to the total size of packets was 0.16. When we used
a 2GB packet store, the average redundancy proportion increased to
20%. For trafﬁc originating from the high-volume /24 preﬁx, the re-
dundancy proportion was 50% on average with a 2GB packet store.
These observations show that when redundancy elimination is ap-
plied in a localized fashion on individual access links, the utilization
of the links can be reduced by 16-50%.
Extent of duplication across destinations. Our redundancy-
aware approaches are most effective when content is duplicated across
multiple destinations. To examine the beneﬁts of redundancy aware-
ness, we emulate a scenario where trafﬁc originating at our vantage
points (i.e. the University access link and the /24 preﬁx) is routed
across the internal network of a tier-1 ISP (SprintLink). For both
cases, we assume that the trafﬁc enters the ISP at its Chicago PoP.
Using traceroute and undns [23] we mapped the destination preﬁxes
observed in traces to PoPs of the tier-1 ISP. We then examined how
often content is duplicated across different ISP PoPs.
In Figure 4(a), we show the number of different PoPs to which a
distinct 64B chunk observed in a trace was destined to. We study
a full University trace (redundancy proportion of 17%) and a trace
of trafﬁc from the high-volume /24 preﬁx (redundancy of 48%). In
the former case, we note that for 97% of the chunks, either there
were no duplicates or the duplicates went to the same PoP as the
original. In 3% of the cases, the duplicate and original chunks were
destined to 2 distinct PoPs. For the trace of the /24 preﬁx, we see
more signiﬁcant duplication across PoPs, with duplicates destined
for 2 PoPs in nearly 10% of the cases. In general, very few chunks
are duplicated across ≥ 3 PoPs in either set of traces. We exam-
ined several other traces and observed similar trends. This justiﬁes
our approach of focusing only on the amount of content duplicated
across pairs of destinations when computing redundancy proﬁles.
Next, we examine whether content duplicated across a set of des-
tinations amounts to a signiﬁcant proportion of all trafﬁc sent to
the destinations. In Figure 4(b), we show the total volume of traf-
ﬁc originating from the high-volume /24 preﬁx which is duplicated
across a pair of destination PoPs, relative to the total volume of traf-
ﬁc from the /24 to the two PoPs. We see that the proportion of
shared content varies signiﬁcantly across different pairs of destina-
tion PoPs. In many cases, there is very little sharing of redundant
content: the proportion of shared content is < 1% for nearly 80% of
the PoP pairs. For roughly 10% of PoP pairs, the extent of sharing is
very signiﬁcant, ranging between 5 and 15% of the total trafﬁc. We
studied other traces of the /24 preﬁx and observed a similar trend
of a few PoP pairs sharing a signiﬁcant amount of content. Further-
more, we also found signs of positive correlation between the total
volume of trafﬁc of the PoP pair and the extent of content shared
(the results are omitted for brevity).
6. EVALUATION
In this section, we present results from an extensive study of the
beneﬁts of redundancy elimination both when applied to traditional
routes and when applied along with redundancy-aware routes. We
consider both intra and inter-domain settings. We also examine the
impact of network topology on the beneﬁts derived. Finally, we
study the ability of redundancy elimination and redundancy-aware
approaches to absorb sudden trafﬁc surges.
Unless otherwise stated, our metric of comparison is the network
footprint which reﬂects the aggregate utilization of an ISP’s network
resources. A signiﬁcant reduction in network footprint implies that
an ISP is able to better control the usage of its network resources
and meet its trafﬁc engineering goals in a more effective fashion.
We mostly focus on beneﬁts in the ideal case, in that we assume
networks have perfect information regarding the redundancy pro-
ﬁles and can compute redundancy-aware routes instantaneously. We
do study the impact of practical limitations from staleness of redun-
dancy proﬁles. Our evaluation is based both on the real packet traces
(Section 5), and synthetic traces which are described next.
Our study indicates that redundancy elimination and redundancy-
awareness can reduce network footprint to a very signiﬁcant extent.
Thus, the beneﬁts of a universal deployment of redundancy elimi-
nation seem to easily offset the initial cost of deploying the mecha-
nisms on multiple network routers.
Generating Synthetic Traces. Synthetic traces allow us to ex-
plore the relationship between various redundancy proﬁles and the
overall beneﬁts offered by our approaches. We construct synthetic
traces based on key properties of real packet traces.
In what follows, we ﬁrst outline how to generate a synthetic intra-
domain trace for trafﬁc originating at a single PoP of an ISP’s topol-
ogy. This can be extended trivially to network-wide intra-domain
traces, as well as to inter-domain traces.
Packets are of the same size in all synthetic traces. Each synthetic
trace has three parameters: ρoverall ∈ [0, 0.5] and ρintra, ρinter ∈
[0, 1]. These determine if there are duplicate packets, and whether
the duplicate packets are all headed for the same destination.
To elaborate, ρoverall is the total fraction of redundancy in the
trafﬁc; For instance, when ρoverall = 0.5, only 50% of the pack-
ets are unique. In general, no packet has more than one duplicate
in all our synthetic traces. Thus, we do not model duplication of
content across 3 or more destinations. As our empirical study in the
previous section showed, this approximation is unlikely to affect the
representativeness of our synthetic trace-based analyses.
ρoverall
To construct the trace, we ﬁrst create a large number of unique
(1−ρoverall ) .
packets. Each packet has a duplicate with probability
If a packet has no duplicate (with probability (1−2ρoverall )
(1−ρoverall ) ), we
“send” the packet to a PoP in the ISP selected with a probability pro-
portional to the population of the city represented by the PoP (this is
based on the gravity model for network trafﬁc volumes [21]). If the
packet has a duplicate, we create the duplicate, and with probability
ρintra, we send the packet and its duplicate to the same destination,
where the destination is selected according to the gravity model;
thus, ρintra controls the number of packets which are duplicated
between a pair of PoPs. With a probability ρinter = 1 − ρintra, we
select two different destinations according to the gravity model, and
send them a copy each; thus, ρinter controls the number of packets
duplicated across two different destinations.
We assume that routers have sufﬁcient memory to store all pack-
ets within a synthetic trace that are forwarded to them.
Evaluation strategy. Given a trace, synthetic or real, and a net-
work topology, we compute aggregate redundancy proﬁles using the
approach described in Sec 3.3.2. We compute routes according to
the redundancy-aware algorithms of Sections 3 and 4. We use real-
istic ISP topologies (with link latencies) from Rocketfuel [23].

6.1 Beneﬁts in the Intra-Domain Setting
We ﬁrst evaluate the beneﬁts of redundancy-aware routing in an
uncapacitated intra-domain setting with trafﬁc from a single ingress.
Synthetic traces. First, we employ a variety of synthetic traces
to examine the beneﬁts. In Figure 5, we compare SP-RE and RA
against SP for trafﬁc originating from the Seattle PoP in the ATT
network topology (AS7018). In Figure (a), we present the reduction
in network footprint under a range of different inter- and intra-ﬂow
redundancy proportions (i.e. ρinter and ρintra values), but the over-
all redundancy fraction remains unchanged (ρoverall = 0.5). From
Figure 5(a), we note that the beneﬁts of redundancy elimination in
general are quite signiﬁcant: the network footprint reduces 27-50%
with RA and 6-50% with SP-RE.
We also note that RA offers substantial reduction in network foot-
print compared to SP-RE. In particular, when redundant content is
duplicated across multiple destination PoPs (i.e., as ρinter → 1),
RA is signiﬁcantly better (27% reduction due to RA compared with
6% due to SP-RE). At the other extreme, when most duplicated
packets travel between the same source-destination pair (i.e. as
ρintra → 1), the beneﬁts of RA relative SP-RE start to diminish,
and RA eventually becomes identical to SP-RE.
In Figure 5(b) we vary ρoverall while keeping ρinter = 1. At a
low fraction of the overall redundancy proportion (ρoverall < 0.1),
RA and SP-RE are essentially indistinguishable. When ρoverall ≥
0.2, we see that RA offers signiﬁcant beneﬁts compared to SP-RE:
RA can reduce the network footprint but a further 6-20%.
These observations indicate that redundancy awareness generally
offers substantial improvements in network utilization under a wide
range of possible redundancy proﬁles, compared both to current
routing and to simple redundancy elimination.
Next, we analyze the impact of topology on the beneﬁts of re-
dundancy awareness. In Figure 6(a), we plot a distribution of the
beneﬁts due to RA and SP-RE as we change the ingress PoP in the
ATT network. We set ρoverall = 0.5 and ρinter = 1. We see that
the beneﬁts from both RA and SP-RE vary with the ingress PoP, but,
in general, RA offers signiﬁcant improvements over SP-RE. While
SP-RE alone can reduce the footprint by 2-22%, the beneﬁts of RA
