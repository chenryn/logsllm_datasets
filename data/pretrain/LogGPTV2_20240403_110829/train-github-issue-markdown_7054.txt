### Environment Details
- **Symfony Version:** 2.3.4
- **PHP Version:** 5.4.20-1~dotdeb.0
- **Operating System:** Debian 6.0.7

### Issue Description
When using the locale "en" or "de," the country and language selectors function as expected, displaying a full list of countries and languages. However, when using the locale "en_GB," the selectors do not display the full list of options.

### Screenshot
Please find attached an image that illustrates the issue with both selectors when using the "en_GB" locale.
