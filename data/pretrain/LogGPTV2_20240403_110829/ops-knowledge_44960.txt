User: If I run a python script (with Linux) which reads in a file (e.g.: with open(inputfile) as infi:): Will the file be in danger when I abort the script by pressing Ctrl C?
Assistant: Probably not. It will release the file handle when the script stops running. Also you typically only have to worry about corrupting a file when you kill a script that is writing to the file, in case it is interrupted mid-write.
