• Keep an eye out for the party van (or cable
technicians)
• Pay for service on one modem and have another
one hooked up that is modified for anonymous
internet
• Be careful with which HFC MAC addresses you
clone
• Remove line identifiers to assist in anonymity
(especially at apartment complexes)
24
Response From the SERC Showcase
• Anonymous Internet was not nearly as much of a
concern as BPI/BPI+ in DOCSIS 1/1.1/2.0
– The maximum privacy that is offered via encryption is 56bit DES.

FIRMWARE OVERVIEW
The good, the bad and the excellent…
26
Enter bitemytaco
Pros
• You may already have it,
referred to as shelled
firmware.
• Every bit as functional as
hacked firmware if you
know what you’re doing.
• Stock firmware straight
from the manufacturer.
Cons
• RTFM.
• May take some trial and
error to configure for
proper use.
• No GUI.
27
Diagnostic Factory Firmware
Pros
• Works without too much
trouble.
• Fairly decent list of
firmware features.
• Based on altered
versions of factory
shelled firmware.
Cons
• Created by DerEngel’s
hired group of coders.
• You install a license to
use it.
• Costs money
• Beware of possible
backdoors and rebooting
issues.
28
Sigma X2
Pros
• Free alternatives to
sigma (no licenses).
• Improved features for a
changing world.
• Based directly off factory
shelled firmwares.
• Stable!
Cons
• Still some bugs.
• So many features it can
become confusing.

– Autoserv & Client (upload and host configs from flash memory)
– Set static HFC IP, subnet and gateway
– Spoof vendor,model, version & change SNMP ports used
– Console webshell & telnetd with diagnostic output
– Webif authentication
– Firmware upgrade via webif
– Backup and restore complete flash & non-vol settings
– Skipped modem config checks
30
Haxorware & Proof of the Future
Hands down the most advanced firmware available
for SB5101 or BCM3449 chipsets

Background Information

Objectives for Honest Discussions
Provide an open forum for users, hackers,
professionals & law enforcement:
-Hacked modems exist, warrantless wiretaps legal?
-Used for anonymous, free or faster internet
-Virtually undetectable / Could be used for evil
Understand & evaluate Docsis networks as a
viable telecommunications protocol:
-The nature of Docsis HFC networks & hardware
-Security flaws & Best practices
-Improper use and abuse by all parties
-How can we make it better & Can We Coexist?
• Just another computer
– Chipset: Broadcom BCM3348/BCM3349
– Processor: 200MHz MIPS-32 core with MMU
– RAM: 16-bit SDRAM bus with 8MB RAM
(upgradeable)
– Storage: 2MB Flash ROM
– OS: RTOS (Real Time Operating System)
• WindRiver’s VxWorks
• ECOS (Embedded Configurable operating system)
• QNX (Microkernels are good)
• Unix-like UI
• X86 or MIPS flavors
35
What is a Docsis Cable Modem?
• BPI: Baseline Privacy Interface
– Methods for encrypting traffic between the cable modem and the
CMTS at triple 56bit DES with 768/1024 bit key modulus
• BPI+: Baseline Privacy Interface Plus
– Implemented in Docsis 1.1 Specs (Backwards compatible)
– Introduces X.509 v3 (RSA 1024bit) digital certificates & key pairs
– Authentication based on certificate hardware identity; validated
when modem registers with a CMTS
Certificates, Keys & The ‘trust ring’
– Stored in the non-vol settings of a modems firmware
– Contains: Public, Private, and Root Keys, CM & CA Certificates
– DOCSIS Root CA signs manufacturer CA intermediate
certificate, manufacturer signs CM certificate. CMTS parses and
verifies CM certificate, an identity based on HFC MAC
36
Trust: Encryption & Authentication
• Hardware (blame the manufacturers)
– Absolutely no physical security
– Common hardware components
• Software (blame the developers)
– Initial hacks involved netboot/etherboot, enabling built in factory
mode (implemented by the OS and enabled by setting a SNMP
OID) or using stock (noisy) bootloaders.
– Diagnostic firmware does the job, but better firmware with
custom features is easy to make
• ISP (blame the administrators)
– Improperly configured CMTS
– Security flaws in CMTS IOS
– Costs & Convenience
37
Why hacking modems is possible?
38
Perspectives: Role Playing
•Customers
-Protect and respect our privacy
-Provide us with quality but NOT limited service
-Stop charging more when you’ve failed…
•Hackers
-You might expect this
-We demand anonymous internet access (why not?)
-You make it so easy, it seems like it’s on purpose
-Not my fault the network is not configured properly
-…You WILL still have a problem
•ISPs
-We should probably just lie
-Let’s cut corners to save money
-Unlimited user bandwidth bad (Customer monthly throughput < Profit)
-You can’t do that on the Internets!
-Your information is being sold to the highest bidder
DISASSEMBLING THE
FIRMWARE
This firmware sucks!…
39
• Three types of firmware images:
– Signed & Compressed (PKCS#7 & binary)
– Compressed binary image
– RAM dump images (uncompressed & raw)
• A dump image is loaded in IDA Pro for
reversing work or manipulation.
• Current firmware uses VxWorks or ECOS,
both are coded in MIPS-32 assembly (fun
for the whole family).
40
Firmware Images
Anatomy of the flash contents
41
• Unsigned firmware binary images
• LZMA, CMImageTool by BOLTAR or
other custom applications
• Your favorite hex editor
• IDA Pro Advanced
• Your favorite compiler (write your own)
• Serial console cable
• Jtag (optional)
• Vacation from real life & a lot of patience
42
Reverse & Disassemble Tools
The Future
• Better firmware
• ISP lockdowns
-Craigslist is full of morons
• Docsis 3.0
-More speed, essentially the same security
-Advanced class of service mappings
• Purposefully designed anonymous networks
-In a perfect world, this would be a priority
43
Problems & Some solutions
BPI+
• Crack 56bit DES or X.509 v3 RSA? (time, money and more time)
• Corporate espionage
• Self signed certificates
• Reverse current bpimanager & built in self signing functions
Cloning Detection
• Exact/Perfect clones can usually bypass this
• Network access can be gained on the majority of ISP as long as
authentication is passed, cloning isn’t exactly necessary
• If you still can’t force a config to get network access, firmware
modification is usually the answer.
The situation for ISPs preventing unauthorized
access still looks very bleak for several reasons
44
• Anonymous / Fast Internet on Docsis networks
• Equipment used
• Cloning and Perfect Clones
• How to stay anonymous
• Firmware flavors & features
• Why it’s possible
• Hardware & Security
• BPI+
• Development & reversing is kind of easy
• Security changes can be defeated
• Future plans are just as insecure
Remember this stuff
45
• Anonymous network technicians that answered
questions about OSS.
• Thanks to DerEngel of TCNiSO for essentially
starting mainstream cable modem hacking.
• Anonymous cable modem hackers who share
their stories with enough information to verify.
• Manufacturers for creating such insecure
hardware and software.
• ISPs like Comcast whose walled garden is more
like an wide open picket fence.
• Where da moviez at? & friends
