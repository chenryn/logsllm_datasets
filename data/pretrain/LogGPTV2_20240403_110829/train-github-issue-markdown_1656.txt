By default babel is looking for `node_modules` in current directory.  
But sometimes we need to use `node_modules` from some child or other
directory.  
I tried to use `NODE_PATH` env, but it doesn't work.  
So, maybe it's good idea to add supporting some environment variable, for
example `BABEL_NODE_MODULES` with list of path to search `node_modules`
directory.  
Let's make babel more flexible!
