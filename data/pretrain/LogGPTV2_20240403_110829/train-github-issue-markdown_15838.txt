This issue is new as of 0.6.3121.0, and is happening for profiles I've had
around for a long time.
# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.19023.0
    Windows Terminal version: 0.6.3121.0
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Have an existing, custom profile in `profiles.json` that does _not_ specify a `startingDirectory`.
  2. Open a tab with that profile.
  3. ðŸ’¥
  4. Add `startingDirectory` to the profile in question.
  5. Open a tab with that profile again.
  6. No ðŸ’¥
# Expected behavior
No ðŸ’¥
# Actual behavior
