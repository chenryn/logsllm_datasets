User: I have install Anaconda 2.0.1 on KDE desktop. When I run python and would see all modules installed, I have this message "Cannot mix incompatible Qt library (version 0x40801) with this library (version 0x40805)",
Can I fix the problem if I unintall Qt library (version 0x40801)? 
How I do that? 
Or if someone have another suggestion,please help me, 
Thx very much
Assistant: QT aggressively tries to find other QT installations on the system. It is likely finding the one installed by Linux. You likely can't remove this, as there are probably several programs that come with Linux that use QT, but is it possible to update it to the same version?
