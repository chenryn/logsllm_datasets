## Abstract
As information-centric networks (ICNs) are increasingly deployed in diverse settings, there is a growing need to protect the privacy of participants. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a security framework that addresses this need. The framework ensures the integrity and confidentiality of published content, associated metadata, and subscriber interests. Publishers can control access to their content and specify which nodes can broker access. Subscribers can limit which nodes can see their interests. Access control policies are defined based on node attributes and are enforced using cryptographic primitives. The system supports deployment in heterogeneous mobile ad hoc environments where trust may derive from multiple independent sources, and it does not require an external public key infrastructure. We also report on the overhead introduced by the security measures in actual deployments on Android devices.

## 1. Introduction
Information-centric networking (ICN) is a paradigm for content distribution and retrieval that shifts from the traditional source-destination data routing model to one where naming and routing are driven by the data content. In ICN, data movement is determined by the interests of nodes in the network and the extent to which these interests match the descriptions of published content. This paradigm raises questions about naming, caching, forwarding, data dissemination, scaling, and interoperability with existing networks. These questions have motivated extensive research in the area [27].

In 2011, the United States Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated the Content-Based Mobile Edge Networking (CBMEN) program [10] to develop an ICN solution for commodity mobile devices. By 2014, ICN technologies were being commercialized, such as PARC's Content Centric Networking prototype [11].

A critical issue in ICN is the privacy of data in the network. Unlike point-to-point communication, ICN metadata needed for routing is directly related to the content. While some information must be revealed to enable routing, the ideal goal is to reveal only the output of the matching algorithm. Current solutions, however, often reveal more than necessary by providing metadata in the clear.

We propose a privacy-enhanced ICN solution for publish-subscribe systems. We use multi-authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE) [18] to provide publishers with access control for their data and to protect metadata. Although our approach does not achieve the ideal privacy goal, it provides a reasonable trade-off between privacy and efficiency.

Content sharing at the mobile edge is increasing with the introduction of features like Android Beam [5] and iOS AirDrop [3]. Our focus is on the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) setting, where parties can join and leave the system arbitrarily, and we cannot rely on persistent communication channels. This setting is relevant to scenarios such as emergency response, conference data sharing, and event multimedia sharing. However, the MANET setting makes achieving privacy guarantees more challenging.

Advanced cryptographic tools like encrypted search schemes [8, 13] and functional encryption [9, 16] do not fully meet our needs due to high computational overhead. Instead, we provide a mechanism where each participant can declaratively scope the nodes that can serve as brokers. These brokers see only hashed versions of the metadata, sufficient for running a matching algorithm. Our system also ensures data integrity through cryptographic signatures and certificates.

For bootstrapping trust and distributing credentials, we distribute trust across multiple authorities, avoiding the need for a single central trusted authority. We develop credential distribution protocols assuming only short secrets shared out-of-band between parties and their trusted authorities.

Our system extends the Haggle framework [21], designed for opportunistic networking. Its modular architecture supports various underlying protocols, routing algorithms, caching schemes, and security designs. Our solution for ensuring content and query authenticity and confidentiality is agnostic to other aspects of the system and can be composed with different routing and caching schemes. We evaluate the overhead added by our security solution in real-world Android deployments.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines our goals, Section 3 provides an overview of our approach, Section 4 describes the general security architecture, Section 5 details our specific design, Section 6 explains the changes made to a mature ICN, Section 7 reports on the overhead in real-world deployments, and Section 8 discusses our contributions in relation to previous work. We conclude with highlights in Section 9.

## 2. Goals
ICNs route content based on associated descriptions and the interests of nodes. In existing ICN solutions, requests for content and content descriptions are visible to all nodes, raising significant privacy concerns. Our goal is to mitigate these privacy issues for publishers and subscribers in an ICN.

### 2.1 Data Integrity
To ensure data integrity, we use cryptographic signatures. Each node signs the content it publishes and provides a certificate from an authority that binds the node’s identity to a signature verification key. This allows subscribers to verify the authenticity and integrity of the content they receive.

### 2.2 Data Confidentiality
We use attribute-based encryption (ABE) to protect content when the potential receivers are unknown at the time of publication. Ciphertext-policy ABE embeds an access policy into each ciphertext, and decryption keys are associated with a set of attributes. A key can decrypt a ciphertext if its attributes satisfy the encryption policy. Nodes receive keys with appropriate attributes (e.g., organization, position, or role) from authorities, allowing publishers to encrypt content with flexible access control policies.

### 2.3 Metadata Confidentiality
Routing decisions in ICNs are based on metadata, including tags describing the content and subscribers' interests. To minimize metadata exposure, we allow publishers and subscribers to scope the nodes that can make routing decisions using MA-ABE, similar to how it is used for content encryption.

### 2.4 Intermediated Operation
Data exchange should not require direct interaction between publishers and subscribers. This is particularly important in dynamic networks where nodes may not have stable connections.

## 3. Overview
Our security solution for ICN publish-subscribe systems addresses the requirements outlined in Section 2 through the following extensions:

### 3.1 Data Integrity
We use cryptographic signatures to provide data integrity. Each node signs the content it publishes and provides a certificate from an authority. This allows subscribers to verify the authenticity and integrity of the content. We also introduce a trust chaining approach to expand the set of trusted nodes as content is forwarded.

### 3.2 Data Confidentiality
We use ABE to protect content. Ciphertext-policy ABE embeds an access policy into each ciphertext, and decryption keys are associated with a set of attributes. Nodes receive keys with appropriate attributes from authorities, allowing publishers to encrypt content with flexible access control policies.

### 3.3 Metadata Confidentiality
We use MA-ABE to minimize metadata exposure. Publishers and subscribers can scope the nodes that can make routing decisions by scoping access to the associated metadata.

## 4. Architecture
Our ICN solution accommodates the dynamic nature of the network, where nodes join and leave at arbitrary rates and connections are not guaranteed to be stable.

### 4.1 Participants
Our ICN solution is designed for a decentralized mobile publish-subscribe system. There are four roles for nodes in the network: publishers, subscribers, brokers, and authorities. Each node can assume multiple roles at different stages of the protocol.

- **Publishers:** Add content to the network along with descriptive tags.
- **Subscribers:** Broadcast node descriptions that include their interests.
- **Brokers:** Facilitate data routing by forwarding content based on matches between content tags and node interests.
- **Authorities:** Provide the credentials necessary for the cryptographic protocols in the system.

### 4.2 Co-Certification
The root of trust in our ICN solution is an authority that issues credentials for participants. In a distributed setting, we distribute trust across multiple authorities, avoiding the need for a single central trusted authority. We develop credential distribution protocols assuming only short secrets shared out-of-band between parties and their trusted authorities.

## 5. Design
Our specific design includes the following components:

### 5.1 Data Integrity
Each node signs the content it publishes and provides a certificate from an authority. Subscribers can verify the authenticity and integrity of the content using the certificate.

### 5.2 Data Confidentiality
We use ABE to protect content. Ciphertext-policy ABE embeds an access policy into each ciphertext, and decryption keys are associated with a set of attributes. Nodes receive keys with appropriate attributes from authorities, allowing publishers to encrypt content with flexible access control policies.

### 5.3 Metadata Confidentiality
We use MA-ABE to minimize metadata exposure. Publishers and subscribers can scope the nodes that can make routing decisions by scoping access to the associated metadata.

### 5.4 Intermediated Operation
Data exchange does not require direct interaction between publishers and subscribers. Brokers facilitate the routing of content based on matches between content tags and node interests.

## 6. Implementation
We implemented our design by extending the Haggle framework [21], which is designed for opportunistic networking. The modular architecture of Haggle supports various underlying protocols, routing algorithms, caching schemes, and security designs. Our solution for ensuring content and query authenticity and confidentiality is agnostic to other aspects of the system and can be composed with different routing and caching schemes.

## 7. Evaluation
We evaluated the overhead introduced by our security solution in real-world Android deployments. The results show that our approach adds minimal overhead while providing robust security and privacy guarantees.

## 8. Related Work
Our work builds on and extends previous research in ICN and cryptographic techniques. We discuss our contributions in relation to existing work and highlight the unique aspects of our approach.

## 9. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have presented a security framework for ICNs that ensures the integrity and confidentiality of published content, associated metadata, and subscriber interests. Our approach uses cryptographic primitives to enforce access control policies and minimize metadata exposure. The system is designed for deployment in heterogeneous mobile ad hoc environments and does not require an external public key infrastructure. We have evaluated the overhead introduced by our security measures in real-world Android deployments and found it to be minimal. Future work will focus on further improving the efficiency and scalability of our solution.
