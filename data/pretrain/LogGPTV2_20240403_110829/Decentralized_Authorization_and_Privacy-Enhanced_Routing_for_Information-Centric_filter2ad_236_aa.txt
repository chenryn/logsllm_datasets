ABSTRACT
As information-centric networks are deployed in increasingly
diverse settings, there is a growing need to protect the privacy
of participants. We describe the design, implementation, and
evaluation of a security framework that achieves this.
It
ensures the integrity and conﬁdentiality of published content,
the associated descriptive metadata, and the interests of
subscribers.
Publishers can scope access to the content, as well as which
nodes in the network can broker access to it. Subscribers
can limit which nodes can see their interests. Scopes are
deﬁned as policies over attributes of the individual nodes.
The system transparently realizes the policies with suitable
cryptographic primitives. It supports deployment in hetero-
geneous mobile ad hoc environments where trust may derive
from multiple independent sources. Further, no external
public key infrastructure is assumed. We also report on the
overhead that the security adds in actual deployments on
Android devices.

INTRODUCTION
Information-centric networking (ICN) is a paradigm for
content distribution and retrieval. It departs from the tra-
ditional source-destination data routing model by shifting
to a framework where naming and routing are driven by the
data content. The general premise is that data movement
should be determined by the interests of nodes in the network
and the extent to which the interests match descriptions of
published content. This networking paradigm raises many
questions about the naming of objects, caching and forward-
ing algorithms, granularity of data dissemination, scaling
for large deployments, and interoperation with extant net-
works. These questions have motivated much research in the
area [27]. In 2011, the United States Department of Defense’s
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated the
Content-Based Mobile Edge Networking (CBMEN) [10] pro-
gram to develop an ICN solution that works on commodity

mobile devices. By 2014, ICN technologies started being
commercialized – for example, PARC is currently engaged
with network device manufacturers and service providers for
productizing its Content Centric Networking prototype [11].
An important question that is inherently related to the
new ICN routing mechanisms is the privacy of the data in
the network [1]. Unlike solutions with point-to-point commu-
nication paths, in the case of ICN the metadata needed for
the routing algorithm is directly related to the content of the
published data objects. This is because routing decisions are
based on matches between content descriptions and nodes’
interests. While information about these matches has to be
revealed in order to enable the networking functionality, the
ideal privacy goal for ICN is to reveal nothing more about
the content in the network than the output of the matching
algorithm that determines the routing. However, current
solutions reveal much more than this by providing metadata
describing the content as well nodes’ interests in the clear.
We propose a privacy-enhanced information-centric net-
working solution for publish-subscribe systems. We employ
cryptographic techniques, such as multi-authority attribute-
based encryption (MA-ABE) [18], in order to provide the
publishers of content with access control for their data. We
leverage similar mechanisms to provide ﬂexible protection
of the metadata in the system as well. While the guaran-
tees that we obtain for the privacy of the metadata do not
achieve the ideal goal posed above, they provide a reasonable
trade-oﬀ between privacy protection and usable eﬃciency for
the system, given the current state of cryptographic tools.
Content sharing at the mobile edge is poised to rise dra-
matically with the recent introduction of Android Beam [5]
and iOS AirDrop [3]. Consequently, we focus on the mobile
ad hoc network (MANET) setting for our ICN architecture,
where parties can join and leave the system arbitrarily and we
cannot rely on persistent communication channels between
any parties in the network. Such a setting is relevant to
many real world scenarios for ICN applications. For example,
when emergency responders must communicate at the scene
of a disaster, conference attendees create virtual groups to
share research data, or sports fans share multimedia content
at an event venue. However, the MANET setting makes our
task for providing privacy guarantees much harder.
Even advanced cryptographic tools such as encrypted
search schemes [8, 13] and functional encryption [9, 16] do
not suﬃce for achieving our ideal goal. We do not pursue
extensions of these tools in order to overcome existing deﬁ-
ciencies since this will result in high computational overhead
that would hinder the usability of our system. Instead we
31
provide a mechanism that allows each participant to declar-
atively scope the nodes in the network that can serve as
brokers on its behalf. The selected brokers see only hashed
versions of the metadata, which is enough for them to be able
to run a matching algorithm. Our system further provides
data integrity for the content and metadata published in the
network by applying cryptographic signatures on the data
objects and providing certiﬁcates to the participants in the
network.
A major question for any system based on cryptographic
primitives that require private credentials is how to bootstrap
trust in the system and distribute corresponding credentials.
A single central trusted authority in a dynamically changing
system with multiple parties is not a reasonable assump-
tion. This is why we built a solution that distributes trust
across multiple authorities and use cryptographic primitives
designed for such a decentralized trust model. We do not
assume that the participants in the system already have
their credentials in advance. Instead, we develop credential
distribution protocols assuming only short secrets shared
out-of-band between parties and their trusted authorities.
The system we describe is an extension of the Haggle
framework [21] that was originally designed for opportunistic
networking. Its modular architecture supports development
and integration of a wide range of underlying protocols,
routing algorithms, caching schemes, and security designs.
The solution we created for ensuring the authenticity and
conﬁdentiality of content and queries is agnostic to the other
aspects of the system.
It can be composed regardless of
the routing and caching schemes used. We have evaluated
the overhead that our security solution adds and report the
results here.
We describe our goals in Section 2 before providing an
overview of our approach in Section 3. Section 4 outlines
our general security architecture, which can be used by most
ICNs. Section 5 describes our speciﬁc design, including the
protocols used. Section 6 explains the changes we made to
a mature ICN to implement our concrete design. Section 7
reports on the overhead from security when it is added to a
real world Android deployment. We describe our contribution
in relation to previous work in Section 8 and conclude with
its highlights in Section 9.
2. GOALS
ICNs route content based on an associated description
(such as an identiﬁer, a name, or tags) and the interests of
nodes in the network. ICN routing algorithms thus depend
on the ability to match descriptions of published data and
the interests advertised by other nodes.
In existing ICN
solutions, requests for content as well as content descriptions
are visible to any node in the network, which introduces a
substantial privacy problem.
The goal of our work is to mitigate the privacy concerns of
publishers that tag content and subscribers that request this
content in an ICN. The problem of ensuring data conﬁden-
tiality is addressed in traditional packet-based networks by
using encryption for all data sent between a speciﬁc source
and destination [24]. We note that we cannot hope to achieve
the same level of privacy in the context of an ICN because
this will render impossible most ICN routing functionality.
Thus, our ideal goal will be a solution that hides everything
about the published content and subscribers’ requests except
the routing decisions.
Communication networks allow data to be exchanged by
multiple parties. To realize the utility of the network, we
need to provide a means for users to access the content that
they are authorized to receive while protecting the data from
everyone else in the network. In traditional networking set-
tings this problem can be solved using public key encryption.
Since the intended recipient in known to the publisher, the
sender can encrypt the content with the receiver’s public key.
In the ICN setting, however, a particular piece of content
may have multiple recipients. Therefore, we need a more
ﬂexible mechanism to enforce access control at the point of
encryption, before the potential receivers are known.
Another important requirement for ICNs, where content
does not move directly from publishers to subscribers, is to
guarantee data integrity. An ICN security solution should
let subscribers verify the origin of the content that they
receive as well as the integrity of the content. Together
these will address the threat of maliciously injected data
in the network, by binding the content to its publisher and
guaranteeing non-repudiation.
Many of the nodes in a mobile ad hoc ICN may not have
direct or stable connections. This is why we need routing al-
gorithms that only rely on credentials that each node receives
when it joins the network. In particular, routing should not
require direct point-to-point communication between pub-
lishers and subscribers. This rules out solutions where a
publisher chooses a secret key to compute the tags for its
content and the same secret key is required to generate the
interest metadata that can be matched against the content
tags.
Our ICN’s security goals have the following requirements:
• Content integrity – any receiver can verify the source and
integrity of the obtained content.
• Content conﬁdentiality – publishers can limit access to the
content that they publish.
• Metadata conﬁdentiality – minimize the exposure of the
contents’ descriptive metadata and nodes’ interest.
• Intermediated operation – data exchange should not require
direct interaction between publishers and subscribers.
3. OVERVIEW
We propose a security solution for ICN publish-subscribe
systems. It addresses the requirements described in Section 2
by implementing the following extensions.
Data integrity. We employ cryptographic signatures [22]
to provide data integrity for the content sent in the network.
Each node signs content that it publishes and provides a
certiﬁcate from an authority that binds the node’s identity
to a signature veriﬁcation key. This allows the subscriber
to check the authenticity and integrity of the content they
receive.
Since we are dealing with a dynamic network structure
where participants join and disconnect at an arbitrary rate,
and there may not be time for nodes to get certiﬁed by a
widely trusted authority in the network within this short
period, we introduce a trust chaining approach that expands
the set of nodes that trust some data as it gets forwarded in
the network.
Data conﬁdentiality. We use attribute-based encryption
(ABE) [23] as a mechanism for protecting the content in a
setting where the potential receivers are not known at the
time of publication. The ciphertext-policy attribute-based
encryption [7] primitive embeds an access policy directly
32
into each ciphertext, and associates a set of attributes with
each decryption key. A key can decrypt a ciphertext if and
only if its attributes satisfy the encryption policy. Nodes
receive keys containing appropriate attributes (such as their
organization, position, or role) from authorities. Thus, each
publisher can encrypt each piece of content with a diﬀerent
access control policy that limits the set of nodes that can
decrypt and learn the content based on their attributes.
Since we are dealing with a setting where it is diﬃcult to
agree on a single trusted authority that issues attributes for
all the users, we use multi-authority attribute-based encryp-
tion (MA-ABE) [18] that decentralizes the trust by having
several independent authorities that can issue decryption
keys corresponding to diﬀerent attributes. This allows maxi-
mum ﬂexibility for the publisher.
Metadata conﬁdentiality. The routing decisions in our
ICN solution are made based on metadata, which consists
of the tags describing the published data content and the
interests declared by subscribers. The routing mechanism of
the system aims to move content towards subscribers inter-
ested in it. This is achieved through hop-by-hop matching
of content tags and subscribers’ interests. These matching
decisions are an inherent privacy leak, but are necessary for
the functioning of the system. While there are cryptographic
techniques [9, 16] that can be used to minimize this leakage
at the cost of substantial computational overhead, we adopt
an alternative approach that achieves a trade-oﬀ between
privacy and eﬃciency. We allow publishers and subscribers
to scope the nodes that can make routing decisions for their
data by scoping the access to the associated metadata using
MA-ABE in a manner similar to the way it is used for content
encryption.
4. ARCHITECTURE
We present the architecture for our ICN solution. It aims to
accommodate the dynamic nature of our system where nodes
join and leave the network at arbitrary rates. Such a network
cannot guarantee a stable connection between any two nodes
that can accommodate several rounds of communication.
4.1 Participants
We construct an ICN solution for a decentralized mobile
publish-subscribe system. In this model there are four roles
for nodes in the network: publishers, subscribers, brokers
and authorities. Each node in the network can assume more
than one of these roles in the diﬀerent stages of the protocol.
Publisher nodes add content to the network along with de-
scriptive content tags that will be used for routing. Subscriber
nodes periodically broadcast node descriptions that include
their interests. These descriptions are used by other nodes
to identify which content matches a remote node’s interests.
Broker nodes facilitate the data routing in the network. They
are intermediate nodes that forward content between publish-
ers and subscribers, based on matches between the content
tags and node interests. In addition to these three roles for
ICN participants, some of the nodes in the system will serve
as authorities that provide the credentials necessary for the
cryptographic protocols in the system.
4.2 Co-Certiﬁcation
Similar to other systems, the root of trust in our ICN
solution is an authority that issues credentials for the par-
ticipants. However, since we consider a distributed setting
