indicates poor connectivity whereas a value close to 1 in-
dicates that the phone can support very high data rates for
both interfaces.
2. Capacity (C): We characterize the capacity of a cell phone
based on its CPU speed and memory size. These features
indicate how fast a phone can perform computations as
well as the kind of applications it can run. Like with con-
nectivity, we deﬁne capacity as the unweighted average of
the CPU speed and memory size, which are normalized
by their maximum values in the dataset.
3. Flexibility (F): This refers to the ability of a cell phone to
run applications like Email, Internet browser, and provide
support for running third party applications. We deﬁne
ﬂexibility, F , as the average of three features:
F = (Btype + E + A)/3
(2)
where features Btype, E, and A and their values are de-
ﬁned in Table 5.
4. Insecurity (S): We deﬁne the insecurity of a device as the
average of its status (equal to 1 if the device has been dis-
continued8 and 0 otherwise) and the ratio of the known
vulnerabilities of the device to the total vulnerabilities
across all devices in our dataset.
5.2 Clustering
Using the above abstractions for cell phone features, we now
cluster phones and carry out a cross-abstraction analysis.
Figure 6 shows the visualization of one such clustering us-
ing parallel coordinates. Here, we simply cluster the phones
based on their connectivity value, using k-means clustering
[26] and a cluster size of four9. Each parallel vertical axis
corresponds to an abstraction and each connected line seg-
ments represent a cell phone. We ﬁnd that for a given level
of connectivity, there exists a large range of phone capaci-
ties, which indicates that high speed network interfaces are
8It indicates that the device software would no longer be up-
dated by the vendor and any security vulnerabilities would
remain unchecked until the use of the device is discontinued.
9We choose the cluster size using the Elbow method [24],
which gave a sum of squared error of less than 0.02 for
a cluster size of four with only marginal improvement for
larger cluster sizes.

proxy server can speed up client-side page load process [35],
(b) computations that require high CPU processing and/or
memory can be ofﬂoaded to the cloud [36], (c) for phones
with weak security, providers can provision middleboxes to
enhance the device security, and (d) service providers can
auto-tune TCP/HTTP parameters based on phone features.
Implications for developing regions research: Our insights
reinforce the importance of research on building low cost
data communication channels and developing applications
suited for low-end phones [20, 25, 29, 30]. For example,
Hermes [25] modulates data onto acoustic signals that are
sent over a cellular voice call. It provides 1.2 kbps of good-
put at a cost per byte that is 50× lower than sending data
over SMS, which achieves ∼0.25 kbps of data rate. For
cell phones with basic GSM support, such communication
channels can provide data service and increase data rates.
Similarly, building health, education, and social network-
ing applications for low end phones can beneﬁt a large frac-
tion of users in the developing world. For example, SMSall
[16] (previously Chopal) is a mobile social network based
on SMS that is reportedly being used by more than 7 mil-
lion users. Polly [30], a viral telephone-based system aims
to reach low-literate population for development-related ser-
vices through a voice-based game.
Implications for security: Given that a large number of phones
(∼58.1%) have been discontinued but are still being used,
these phones are vulnerable to a wide range of security at-
tacks. Moreover, as feature information is not available for
all cell phones, an attacker can use similar analysis of ab-
stractions to correlate similar phones to infer missing fea-
ture information. For example, consider two cell phones A
and B. Suppose the cellular interface type of both A and B
is known. While phone A has been discontinued by the ven-
dor, B’s status information is unavailable. An attacker can
use the cellular interface type of the phones to infer that B
may be outdated. Similarly, by inferring the OS type, an at-
tacker can search through online databases (e.g., [4, 14]) for
well-known exploits to launch guided and systematic attacks
(e.g., privilege escalation, memory corruption, DoS attacks,
and SQL injection).
7 Conclusion
We presented an in-depth study of cell phones from one of
the largest cellular providers in Pakistan. Towards this end,
we built a custom cell phone database containing 19 cell
phone features. We analyzed the security implications of
the cell phones being used, identiﬁed potential device-level
bottlenecks, and discussed how they may impact Internet ac-
cess in a developing country like Pakistan. To simplify anal-
ysis of cell phone features, we proposed abstractions and
clustered phones based on these abstractions. Our analysis
provides new insights that can inform various stakeholders
(e.g., service providers and content providers) in the Internet
ecosystem for improving mobile web performance.

ibility, and insecurity using parallel coordinates. We

not necessarily commensurate with high CPU speeds and/or
large memory sizes. We also observe that connectivity value
can be a good indicator for predicting ﬂexibility and insecu-
rity but not phone capacity. This observation could be used
by ISPs and service providers to infer the security and ﬂex-
ibility characteristics of a device based on its network inter-
face type.
6 Discussion and Implications
How is the distribution of phones likely to change over time?
We computed the change in the top-10 phone models (which
make up ∼25% of the phones in our dataset) and the top-
1000 phone models (making up ∼95% of the phones) across
3 months (i.e., October, November, and December). We
found that the change in the top-10 and top-1000 phone mod-
els in the last 3 months was 0% and 0.1%, respectively. This
suggests that the rate of change in cell phone models is low.
Comparison with other public sources of data and countries:
The analysis of our dataset shows that it correlates well with
other sources of public data. For example, a report [1] found
Android to be the most popular OS for smartphone users
in Pakistan. Our dataset showed Android and Symbian to be
the most popular OSes among smartphone users. In a remote
community in Indonesia, Hartigan et al. [27] found that only
∼16% of the phones were smartphones. While we do not
speciﬁcally identify smartphones, 12.5% of the users in our
dataset had phones with WiFi interfaces, which suggests a
similar fraction of smartphones.
Infrastructure support for low-end cell phones: Our anal-
ysis reveals insights that can guide infrastructure support
needed to improve web experience of users with low end cell
phones. One key insight from our work is that changes in the
network must be aware of device limitations. For example,
a substantial fraction of cell phones are equipped with low
data rate cellular interfaces (e.g., GSM, GPRS, and EDGE)
and have slow CPUs and small memory sizes. Many such
phones provide support for running third party applications.
