TABLE IV: Retransmission time of popular MTA servers
We hope our paper can bring attention to this problem,
and that AV companies will start mentioning gray and no-
listing support when they report the top malware families
sending spam in their yearly reports. This additional infor-
mation would require little additional work on their side, but
it can provide a real beneﬁt for the entire community.
VII. RELATED WORK
Spam detection has been an active research topic for
decades. A number of approaches have been proposed to mit-
igate the impact of unsolicited messages. These approaches
can be categorized into sender-based ﬁltering and content-
based ﬁltering methods, based on whether they detect and
block spam before or after accepting the email. Examples of
sender-based ﬁltering methods are blacklists [11], [23], [28]
and graylists [17], [19]. Sender-based ﬁltering approaches
based on server authentication [3] and IP reputation [4], [5],
[14] have also been recently proposed. Examples of content-
based ﬁltering methods include bayesian ﬁlters [29], [36],
collaborative ﬁltering [18], [22] and email prioritization [35],
[38].
Greylisting was initially introduced by Harris [17] in
2003 as a simple and effective method to ﬁlter out spam
emails. One of the ﬁrst experiments that shows the efﬁcacy
of such technique was performed by Levine [24], where
the author pointed out that non-RFC-complaint clients (i.e.
insight about
the clients that does not retry after the ﬁrst failed attempt)
are rare enough to be handled manually with a white-list.
A ﬁrst
the effectiveness of such detection
mechanism was reported by Sochor [31], who evaluated
the performance of greylisting combined with some Postﬁx
restrictions during a long time period, spanning from the
beginning of 2007 to the end of 2008. The author noticed
that the effectiveness of greylisting remained constant over
the two years of experiments. However, he also suggested
that greylisting is not enough as a standalone spam defense
mechanism because of the automatic administration of the
automated white listing. The same author in [32] discusses
different variants of greylisting and makes empirical sugges-
tions about efﬁcient values of the greylisting parameters. He
also recommends to perform additional tests in a controlled
environment due to the unstable intrinsic nature of real email
messages. Even though these works can provide an insight
about the effectiveness of such technique, the experiments
were performed only on a small set of email trafﬁc, for a
limited amount of time, and only on a few servers.
In recent years, botnets have emerged as a major tool
for sending spam from end-hosts. Methods to identify the
spamming bots have been explored in a number of stud-
ies [10], [15], [20], [25], [27], [37]. Note that our analysis
uses such results to select samples and test the efﬁcacy of the
greylisting and nolisting techniques. Thus, previous botnet
studies provided a starting point for our deeper analysis of
570
the role of greylisting and nolisting as anti-spam techniques.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we presented a comprehensive study of
the advantages and disadvantages of using two not very
popular spam ﬁltering techniques: nolisting and greylisting.
In particular, to the best of our knowledge we are the ﬁrst
to measure the effectiveness of nolisting, and the ﬁrst to
test how real malware behaves in the presence of these two
defenses.
Before this work, both supporters and opponents of
nolisting and greylisting had no concrete values to base their
hypothesis and were therefore engaged in a futile battle in
which one side was supporting their adoption and the other
one claimed that these techniques may have worked in the
past but are now useless against recent malware.
We hope that this paper can help system administrators
to decide if they need nolisting or greylisting, and how to
properly conﬁgure these solutions in their networks.
IX. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
We would like to deeply thank Giorgio Biacchi from the
Computer Science department of Univerist`a degli Studi di
Milano, for his help in performing the experiments on the
server of the university.
