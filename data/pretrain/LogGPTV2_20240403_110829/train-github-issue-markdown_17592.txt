**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
I think it bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
webpack uglify already minified file (.min.js)
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
  1. install some dependency with minified build  
`npm i -s three`
  2. write alias to minidied file in config
        extensions: [ '.ts' ],
        alias: {
          three: 'three/build/three.min.js',  // <-----------------------
        }
      },
  3. run webpack in production mode
part in three.min.js  
`THREE.PointsMaterial.");return new
Ha(a)};l.ParticleBasicMaterial=function(a){console.warn("THREE.ParticleBasicMaterial
has`
after uglify two time:  
same part in vendor.min.js  
`THREE.PointsMaterial."),new ue(t)},t.ParticleBasicMaterial=function(t){return
console.warn("THREE.ParticleBasicMaterial has`
**What is the expected behavior?**  
no auto minify already minidied files, parse alias from config and add entries
with (min.js) extension to black list before run uglify, when run uglife check
this black list.
