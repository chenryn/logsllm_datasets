Intel, Brocade, Cyan, Red Hat, and Telefónica – NFV ServicesFigure 5 highlights the sub optimal 
performance achieved.
Optimal NFV Deployment
The secondary deployment uses the 
correct NFV TOSCA and VNFD Mod-
els and the information in the model 
allows the Planet Blue orchestrator to 
optimally deploy the Brocade configu-
ration through the Telefónica VIM and 
achieved full line rate performance of  
23 Mpps (40 Gbps @ 192 Bytes). See 
Figure 5 for performance.
This deployment scenario demonstrates 
the benefits in doing an “intelligent” NFV 
deployment through the EPA aware 
delivery stack onto underlying NFVI 
using the correct extended information 
model containing the attributes required 
for deterministic VNF performance. 
The Brocade vRouter is deployed with 
the correct EPA parameters correctly 
exposed via VNF Descriptor and en-
forced by the Cyan NFVO and the VIM. 
The Brocade vRouter is able to achieve 
the high performance as expected by 
design correctly implementing the PCIe 
pass through, the NUMA awareness, 
CPU pining, and huge page requirement 
as required by the Brocade VNF.
Figure 6 demonstrates similar line  
rate performance but for larger  
packet sizes.

Intel, Brocade, Cyan, Red Hat, and Telefónica – NFV ServicesTestimonials
Telefónica
“ Telefónica’s vision about Virtualized Network is an E2E virtualization approach, from 
customer premises to the inner network infrastructure, as a way to improve capac-
ity and flexibility and to obtain better TCO. Telefónica NFV Reference Lab aims to 
help the ecosystem of partners and network equipment vendors to test and develop 
virtualized network functions leveraging on an advanced NFV orchestration frame-
work and proper capabilities for deterministic resource allocation in the pool. NFV 
Reference Lab drives this adoption through the release of open source code, thus 
encouraging software developers to explore new NFV possibilities and all this from a 
well-designed and tiered architecture proposal. Its aim is to promote interoperability 
and provide a more open ecosystem so that telecommunications providers adapt 
and expand their network services more easily.”
  –  Enrique Algaba, Network Innovation and Virtualisation Director,  
Telefónica I+D-Global CTO
Cyan
“ The intelligent NFV orchestration and placement PoC with Telefónica at Mobile 
World Congress is a clear example of the power of collaboration as it relates to  
driving real-world NFV use cases,” said Mike Hatfield, president, Cyan. “The multi-
vendor platform provides a unique framework for showcasing how Brocade’s VNF 
and Telefónica’s VIM can expose performance requirements and characteristics  
to Cyan’s enhanced infrastructure aware NFV orchestrator. The orchestrator will 
intelligently place the VNFs on Intel servers to meet the VNF’s specific performance 
needs and efficiently use compute resources to deliver end-to-end services. This is  
an important issue that needs to be solved by the industry for deployment of  
NFV-enhanced services at massive scale.”
  –  Mike Hatfield, President, Cyan
Brocade
“ Brocade welcomes the advancements in intelligent orchestration, continued partner-
ship within open initiatives and execution toward key NFV standards. The flexibility 
and openness of Intel’s Network Builders Community has brought together commit-
ted partners dedicated to accelerating the industry’s transition to the New IP.  
The combined efforts of partners such as Telefónica, Intel, and Cyan highlight key 
architecture benefits of Brocade’s VNF platforms, the Vyatta 5600 vRouter, and  
its inherent open information data model for facilitating a migration to intelligent 
architectures with high performance. This also highlights the value of NFV  
orchestrators and their importance to effective and optimal network deployments, 
with Telefónica leading the charge to demonstrate NFV without sacrifice.”
  –  Robert Bays, VP of Engineering, Brocade Software Networking 
Conclusions
•  True End to End NFV aware system 
designs will deliver huge VNF perfor-
mance improvements (23 Mpps v  
270 Kpps) necessary for Telco  
grade performance. 
•  Properly developed end to end NFV 
solutions will reduce Network TCO 
and allow a new ecosystem of VNF 
providers flourish.
•  The community must understand 
these enhanced performance attri-
bute (EPA) capabilities and ensure 
proper exposure up through the End  
to End system. This requires taking  
and end to end system view toward 
implementing the appropriate levels  
of intelligence up through the NFV 
delivery stack to maximize the 
application performance and deter-
minism required for Telco grade  
SLA deployments.
•  The VNF community must understand 
these capabilities and build/model 
their VNFs accordingly.
•  An intelligent EPA aware Orchestra-
tion and VIM are the key components 
toward releasing complete NFV  
TCO value.
•  Intel, Red Hat, Cyan, and Telefónica  
will continue to work to enable Open 
Stack (VIM) with these critical NFV  
EPA enhancements4.
•  Standard and open information 
models are also crucial to enable the 
open VNF ecosystem and enable the 
transition from the world of monolithic, 
vertically integrated network appliances 
to SW defined network functions. 
•  The standardization of the NVF 
service information model as well  
as the availability of open source 
components such as DPDK, Open 
Stack, and optimized KVM are key 
components toward unleashing the 
promise of open NFV solutions 
leveraging best of breed cloud  
open source technologies.

Testimonials (continued)
Intel
“ Intel believes SDN-NDV is an industry inflection point and is committed to ensuring the new 
network architecture transformation is built on an open architecture, using open standards  
enabling an open eco system. Intel is committed to delivering NFV and is actively working 
through the relevant standards and open source initiatives toward making this a reality. Intel 
will makes all its ingredients open source5 though its Open Networking Platform program and 
is working closely with its Netbuilders SDN-NFV ecosystem community6 partners such as Cyan, 
Brocade, and Telefónica to make this a reality.” 
  –  Rene Torres, Intel SDN-NFV Marketing Director
Red Hat
“ Building the foundation for an open NFV infrastructure requires expertise in Linux, KVM, and 
OpenStack—all areas of open source where Red Hat is a leading contributor,” said Radhesh 
Balakrishnan, general manager, OpenStack, Red Hat. “By collaborating on the NFV Reference 
Lab, we’re not only bringing features and expertise back to the upstream OpenStack community 
and our carrier-grade Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack platform, but also enabling CSPs  
to successfully implement their modernization plans through NFV.”
