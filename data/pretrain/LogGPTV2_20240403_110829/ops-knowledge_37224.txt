User: I want to execute a Python script on several (15+) remote machine using SSH. After invoking the script/command I need to disconnect ssh session and keep the processes running in background for as long as they are required to. 
I have used Paramiko and PySSH in past so have no problems using them again. Only thing I need to know is how to disconnect a ssh session in python (since normally local script would wait for each remote machine to complete processing before moving on).
Assistant: On Linux machines, you can run the script with 'at'. 
echo "python scriptname.py" Â¦ at now
