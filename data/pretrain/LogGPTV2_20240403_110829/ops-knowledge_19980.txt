User: I'm used to ending the python interactive interpreter using Ctrl-d using Linux and OS X.  On windows though, you have to use CTRL+Z and then enter.  Is there any way to use CTRL+D?
Assistant: Run Cygwin Python if windowisms are bothering you...  Unless what you are doing depends on pywin32 that is.
