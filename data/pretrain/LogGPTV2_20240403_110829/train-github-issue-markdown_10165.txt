Upon reviewing the video at [this link](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_8/material_ext_publish/0B14F_FSUCc01emlGOWRnRkpMOVk/GoodTransition_QuickDo-v4.webm), it appears that in the iOS build of the gallery, the image initially pops out and is drawn above the app bar before animating into place. When transitioning back to the Shrine home screen, the image animates over the app bar and then snaps back down.

For a more detailed view of this behavior, you can watch the slow-motion video [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-w2rH1ryIJdRW5VUHgwMVNyM1E). For optimal viewing, I recommend playing the video at 0.5x speed to clearly observe the transition effects.
