this stuff before they buy it. Enterprises do, but
consumers do not, so someone’s gotta be looking
out for consumers and giving the consumers this
information.
All consumer participants were familiar with layered labels,
as they had seen QR codes on products such as food, drugs,
or video games. Most of our participants (11/15) expressed
positive attitudes toward the layered design, mainly because
the amount of information that could ﬁt in two layers would
not ﬁt on a single-layer label. Participants also appreciated the
ability to easily gain further insights about the privacy and
security practices of the device manufacturer. These participants
reported that they engage in a combination of online and in-
store shopping. Hence, they believed the layered label design
would be useful to them throughout their purchase process.
Some consumer participants (4/15) thought a layered label
would not be ideal, citing the inconvenience of using a phone
to scan the QR code when shopping in a store, especially
for the elderly. C15 explained: “These technologies for older
generation, they are kind of tough. The idea of installing
something to scan the QR code, it’s going to be too much for
them. I know they prefer to just read everything, put on their
glasses and read everything line by line.” Two participants
expressed concern that companies might withhold important
information from the primary layer and put it only in the
secondary layer.
For each of the factors on the label, we asked consumer
participants to tell us how they believe that factor would impact
their purchase decisions and whether they would like us to
remove the factor or add additional details to the factor. All
participants understood the factors presented on the primary
layer and were able to discuss the potential risks associated
with all of these factors except the level of detail for data
storage. Although they all understood the terms “identiﬁable”
and “anonymous,” participants did not associate identiﬁable
data with risk in this context, perhaps because the utility of a
security camera is increased if it can record videos in which
people are identiﬁable. Further testing is needed to understand
the impact of the interaction between the purpose of data
collection and the granularity of data on consumers’ privacy
concerns.
As we expected, some of the information on the secondary
layer did not convey privacy and security risks to consumer
participants. However, participants still asked to see most of
the factors that we included on the secondary layer because
they wanted to be as informed as possible when purchasing a
smart device.
Participants mentioned that they might search online for
information about unfamiliar factors and the availability of our
label would help them. C5 explained: “I don’t know what TCP
and UDP are. But it’s interesting to have this here, because
then I could go to Reddit and ask on there what that means
and what the capabilities are.”
There were only six factors that 2 or 3 consumer participants
thought should be removed from the label. These secondary-
layer factors were perceived by those participants as lacking
relevance to privacy and security (physical actuations, hardware
and software bill of material), not understandable (MUD
compliant, key management protocols, open network ports),
and not relevant to them (special data handling practices for
children).
At least one consumer participant recognized that some of
the factors in the secondary label might be useful to experts.
C3 explained:
Labels are both for customers and for experts such as
tech journalists, consumer advocacy groups, who are
capable of understanding it and who will click on the
things, and if they see something that is questionable
will raise it in the public press, will raise it with
regulatory authorities, and otherwise. The label is
not just for the consumer, but also there’s another
feedback process that works through experts to the
extent that the information is available at all.
D. Prototype Privacy and Security Label
We used the results from our expert elicitation and consumer
studies as well as recent IoT security standardization and
certiﬁcation efforts to inform the design of a prototype privacy
and security label for a hypothetical smart security camera. Our
design has primary and secondary layers, as shown in Figures 3
and 4, respectively. The secondary layer includes plus signs
next to each item that can be clicked to reveal further details.
We envision that the secondary layer would be accompanied by
a computer-readable version of the label to enable automated
processing and comparison between products, for example by
personal privacy assistants [20] or search engines [24], [36].
Our website at www.iotsecurityprivacy.org has the latest label
design.
V. DISCUSSION
Expert participants recommended including privacy and
security star ratings on an IoT label, mostly because ratings
would help consumers to more easily compare IoT devices
based on their privacy and security practices. All of our
consumer participants liked the idea of having privacy and
security assessments from trustworthy organizations. Although

product packaging or to appear on a product website. View our latest label
design at www.iotsecurityprivacy.org.
we believe these third-party assessments would inform con-
sumers’ purchase behavior, we decided not to include them on
our proposed label, as there is no organization currently doing
these evaluations at scale for a wide range of IoT devices. We
expect to add a place for assessment information once it is
available.
We begin this section by providing a comparison between
certiﬁcations and star ratings. Next, we discuss possible
approaches to IoT privacy and security certiﬁcations.
A. Star Ratings vs. Certiﬁcation Levels
Similar to the Energy Star rating system managed by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) [78], the idea of star ratings
has been proposed for IoT devices to help consumers make
informed purchase decisions [17], [77]. In a hearing of the U.S.
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation’s
Subcommittee on Security [101], Senator Ed Markey suggested
a 5-star security rating system for IoT products. In our study,
while experts were supportive of privacy and security ratings
on the label, they also mentioned two potential challenges of
including them.
The ﬁrst challenge experts brought up relates to the rating
scale. Experts suggested that consumers might have trouble
distinguishing a large number of ratings, yet a more granular
security standard (bronze, silver, gold, platinum, and diamond)
in 2019 [99]. As of January 2020, no devices have been
certiﬁed [100]. As manufacturers start having their devices
certiﬁed, this certiﬁcation could be added to the IoT label.
Since the lowest certiﬁcation level indicates a safe device,
there is a risk that manufacturers will aim to achieve the lowest
level and not bother pursuing higher levels. Market competition
may encourage manufacturers to pursue higher certiﬁcation
levels, especially for devices where the consequences of security
breaches are most severe.
B. Privacy and Security Evaluation and Scoring
Over the past few years, a number of organizations and
research teams have started to develop standards for IoT privacy
and security evaluation and scoring. They include Consumer
Reports [22], YourThings [3], [107], and UL [99].
1) Digital Standard: In 2017, Consumer Reports launched
the Digital Standard to work toward providing a comprehensive
standard that enables organizations to evaluate consumer IoT
products. This standard focuses on four categories: security,
privacy, ownership, and governance & compliance [22].
The security category of the Digital Standard includes build
quality, data security, and personal safety.
Build quality refers to product stability and whether “soft-
ware was built and developed according to the industry’s
best practices for security.” The Cyber Independent Testing
Lab (CITL) [26], a Digital Standard partner,
is actively
evaluating and scoring software of IoT devices according to a
number of factors. Our label design includes a software safety
features element where manufacturers can provide a URL with
information related to software security.
Data security includes authentication, encryption, updatabil-
ity, security audits, and vulnerability disclosure program. All
of these factors are included on our label.
The personal safety category has not yet been deﬁned in the
Digital Standard, although developer notes indicate it will be
related to avoiding abuse and harassment. Media reports suggest
there are many incidents involving smart home devices being
used for domestic abuse [13]. However, device manufacturers
appear to be doing little to address the risks associated with
abuse involving their devices [94]. We have included a factor
called personal safety, which provides a place where device
manufacturers can indicate available safeguards against abusive
behavior once such safeguards have been implemented. Further
discussions with experts are needed to determine how to address
signiﬁcant safety issues effectively on the label. As it was
explained by S4: “Safety means if your car gets hacked, you
die. The room that has a laser attached and if it gets hacked,
it kills you. A drone can be reprogrammed to dive-bomb your
child. I’m not sure how to capture that on the label.”
The privacy section in the Digital Standard includes user
controls, data use and sharing, data retention, and overreach.
The assessment procedure for almost all the privacy factors in
the Standard involves verifying the company’s claimed data
practices with actual data practices.

QR code or typing the URL on the primary layer. View our latest label design

scale could help manufacturers better differentiate their privacy
and security practices. P1, who works in industry, discussed
this issue: “I’m sure industry people, manufacturers, will want
more in there. What would happen if you had something like
this is it might start to grow based on features they want
reﬂected in that rating. Then I can see it becoming a bigger
and bigger scale.”
Experts mentioned that ratings might pose an unhealthy
incentive for IoT companies to achieve full-star ratings only to
be able to compete in the market. Companies may be able to
game the ratings in order to get all the stars and eventually all
products will have all stars, whether they deserve them or not.
S2, an academic, explained: “The problem I have with ratings
like this is that everybody’s gonna get a ﬁve star, because
everybody’s gonna ﬁgure out how to get the ﬁve star.”
To address these challenges, some experts discussed the
idea of having multiple certiﬁcation levels (e.g., silver, gold,
platinum) with a secure baseline or minimum standard instead
of star ratings. This is similar to what the LEED standards use
for rating energy efﬁciency and sustainability of buildings [57].
P8 explained: “I think consumers should know it passes the
minimum security level. If I’m buying a space heater, I know
they’re not allowed to sell me one that will set on ﬁre. I don’t
have to say, oh, it has a 70% score that it will set the house
on ﬁre.”
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) published a 5-level IoT
All the privacy factors mentioned in the Digital Standard are
covered in our proposed label, except overreach. Overreach,
or “collecting too much data” focuses on determining whether
data collection is beneﬁcial to the user, fully disclosed, the
minimum necessary for functionality, and private by default.
This seems like an area where a third-party assessment rather
than a self report is likely warranted.
As some of the experts we interviewed mentioned, consumers
may weigh privacy and functionality trade-offs differently. Thus
it may be difﬁcult to capture a single privacy rating that makes
sense for all consumers. In addition to providing detailed
information about data practices, a future privacy rating system
could be customized based on a consumer’s stated privacy
preferences, which could change over time.
2) YourThings: Alrawi et al. [3] developed a security
evaluation and scoring method for smart home devices. In their
YourThings [107] initiative, they produce device scorecards
with grades in four areas: device, mobile application, cloud
endpoints, and network communication. While our label
provides information related to all of the major areas of
the YourThings rubric as well as some security and privacy
factors not addressed by YourThings, the YourThings scorecard
considers some additional security details, including some that
do not lend themselves to self report. The YourThings scorecard
offers a concise expert summary of device security issues,
which could be useful to include on the label.
The YourThings rubric considers ﬁve device-related factors:
upgradability, exposed services, vulnerabilities, conﬁguration,
and Internet pairing. We include all on our label.
The mobile section of the YourThings rubric includes
sensitive data, programming issues, and “over-privileged,” i.e.,
requesting excess permissions that are not used or required.
Sensitive data is deﬁned in the rubric to include “artifacts like
API keys, passwords, and cryptographic keys that are hard-
coded into the application.” Our label includes factors related
to sensitive data and programming issues such as software
safety features and key management protocol. However, over-
privileged is a factor better assessed by a third-party evaluator
rather than being self-reported.
The cloud endpoints section of the rubric includes domain
categories, TLS conﬁguration, and vulnerable services. Some
of the information needed to compute this score is included on
our secondary layer of the label when fully expanded. However,
details needed to evaluate TLS conﬁguration are not included.
Finally, the network communication section of the rubric
includes protocols, susceptibility to Man in the Middle (MITM)
attack, and use of encryption. While the secondary layer of
our label provides some of the information needed to compute
this score, a third-party evaluation would be needed to provide
a complete assessment.
The concise YourThings scores are useful for comparing
devices, but users may need to drill down to obtain information
relevant to their speciﬁc needs. For example, devices are
penalized for not having automatic updates. While automatic
updates are generally considered the most secure approach,
poorly timed updates can be problematic, potentially interfering
with critical device functions.
3) UL: The 5-level UL certiﬁcation process includes 44
requirements over seven categories: software updates, data &
cryptography, logical security, system management, customer
identiﬁable data, protocol security, and process & documenta-
tion [98].
While our proposed label includes factors from all seven
categories, a third-party evaluation is needed to assess com-
pliance with requirements. Our label can inform consumers
about security and privacy, and goes into more detail about
privacy issues than UL’s customer identiﬁable data category. By
including the UL certiﬁcation in our label, we would offer users
a single concise assessment of device security that complements
the more detailed information provided on the label.
VI. CONCLUSION
We conducted a study with 22 privacy and security experts to
elicit their opinions on the contents of IoT privacy and security
labels. By following a three-round Delphi method, we found the
factors that experts believed should be included on the label, and
distributed them between primary and secondary layers of the
label in three categories (security mechanisms, data practices,
and general/more information). By conducting a series of in-
depth semi-structured interviews with 15 IoT consumers, we
iteratively improved the design of our proposed privacy and
