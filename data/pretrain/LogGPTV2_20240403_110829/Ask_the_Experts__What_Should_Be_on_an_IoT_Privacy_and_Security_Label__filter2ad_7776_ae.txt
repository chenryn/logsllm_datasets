### Consumer Awareness and Information Accessibility

Enterprises typically conduct thorough research before purchasing products, but consumers often lack the same level of scrutiny. Therefore, it is essential to provide consumers with accessible and comprehensive information about the products they are considering.

### Familiarity with Layered Labels

All consumer participants in our study were familiar with layered labels, as they had encountered QR codes on various products, including food, drugs, and video games. The majority (11 out of 15) expressed positive attitudes toward the layered design, primarily because it allows for more detailed information than a single-layer label can accommodate. Participants appreciated the ability to easily access additional insights about the privacy and security practices of device manufacturers. They also noted that they engage in both online and in-store shopping, making the layered label design useful throughout their purchase process.

### Concerns and Limitations

However, some participants (4 out of 15) found the layered label less ideal, particularly due to the inconvenience of scanning QR codes in-store, especially for older consumers. One participant, C15, explained: "For the older generation, these technologies can be challenging. Installing an app to scan a QR code might be too much for them. They prefer to read everything line by line." Additionally, two participants were concerned that companies might withhold important information from the primary layer and place it only in the secondary layer.

### Impact of Label Factors on Purchase Decisions

We asked participants to evaluate how each factor on the label would impact their purchase decisions and whether they would like us to remove or add details to any factor. All participants understood the factors presented on the primary layer and could discuss the potential risks associated with them, except for the level of detail regarding data storage. While they understood the terms "identifiable" and "anonymous," they did not associate identifiable data with risk, possibly because the utility of a security camera increases if it can record identifiable individuals. Further testing is needed to understand the interaction between the purpose of data collection and the granularity of data on consumers' privacy concerns.

### Secondary Layer Information

As expected, some of the information on the secondary layer did not convey privacy and security risks to participants. However, they still requested to see most of the factors included on the secondary layer to be as informed as possible when purchasing a smart device. For example, C5 mentioned: "I don’t know what TCP and UDP are, but it’s interesting to have this here because I could go to Reddit and ask what that means and what the capabilities are."

### Factors for Removal

Only six factors were suggested for removal by 2 or 3 participants. These secondary-layer factors were perceived as lacking relevance to privacy and security (physical actuations, hardware and software bill of materials), being difficult to understand (MUD compliance, key management protocols, open network ports), or not relevant to their needs (special data handling practices for children).

### Expert and Consumer Feedback

At least one participant recognized that some factors in the secondary label might be useful to experts. C3 explained: "Labels are for customers and experts such as tech journalists and consumer advocacy groups who can understand and raise questions in the public press or with regulatory authorities. The label is not just for the consumer but also for a feedback process through experts."

### Prototype Privacy and Security Label

Based on our expert elicitation and consumer studies, we designed a prototype privacy and security label for a hypothetical smart security camera. The label has primary and secondary layers, with the secondary layer providing additional details via clickable plus signs. We envision that the secondary layer would be accompanied by a computer-readable version to enable automated processing and comparison between products, such as by personal privacy assistants or search engines. The latest label design is available at [www.iotsecurityprivacy.org](http://www.iotsecurityprivacy.org).

### Discussion

#### Star Ratings vs. Certification Levels

Experts recommended including privacy and security star ratings on IoT labels to help consumers compare devices. While all consumer participants liked the idea of third-party assessments, we decided not to include them on our proposed label due to the lack of organizations currently conducting these evaluations at scale. A multi-level certification system, similar to the LEED standards, was suggested to address the challenges of star ratings. This system would ensure a secure baseline and encourage higher levels of certification.

#### Privacy and Security Evaluation and Scoring

Several organizations, including Consumer Reports, YourThings, and UL, have developed standards for evaluating IoT privacy and security. Our label covers most of the factors mentioned in these standards, with some exceptions requiring third-party assessments. For instance, the Digital Standard's overreach category, which focuses on collecting the minimum necessary data, may benefit from a third-party evaluation.

### Conclusion

Our study, involving 22 privacy and security experts and 15 IoT consumers, identified key factors for inclusion on IoT privacy and security labels. By using a three-round Delphi method, we distributed these factors between primary and secondary layers, iteratively improving the label design based on consumer feedback. The resulting label provides comprehensive and accessible information to help consumers make informed decisions.
