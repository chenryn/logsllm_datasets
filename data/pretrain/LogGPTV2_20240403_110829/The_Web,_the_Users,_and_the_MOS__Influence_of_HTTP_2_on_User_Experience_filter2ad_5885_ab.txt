2 Due to the explicit binding between host names and IP addresses in hosts ﬁle, no
DNS resolution takes place. This avoids potential bias due to resolution delay and
DNS caching, enabling a fair comparison between H1 and H2 performance.

3.3 Scenarios and MOS Dataset Collection
We aim at collecting MOS grades in (i) realistic scenarios to provide answers
of operational interest, but also in (ii) controlled scenarios that the scientiﬁc
community has already targeted via objective metrics. Given the limited time
available with volunteers, we focus our attention on the following scenarios.
(cid:129) Homogeneous network. Objects are distributed on servers as originally
observed. RTT and packet loss are artiﬁcially forced to be the same for all
virtual servers. RTT can be chosen in {0, 20, 50, 100} ms, and packet loss in
{0, 1, 2}%. Bandwidth is uncapped. These conditions are typically considered
in literature.
(cid:129) Heterogeneous network. As before, but latency reﬂects the original RTT
measured during the collection process. No loss is introduced. Such conﬁgura-
tion introduces realism into the dependency graph of objects download, which
may not arise in case of homogeneous conditions.
(cid:129) Unsharded deployment. All objects are hosted by a single server, on a single
domain name and IP address. RTT to the server is forced in {0, 20, 50, 100} ms.
Bandwidth is uncapped, and no loss is introduced. Unsharded deployment is
useful to contrast today’s production scenarios (i.e., sharding over multiple
domains) vs situations that are by now unrealistic (i.e., all content hosted on
a single “unsharded” domain) where H2 beneﬁts are expected to appear [12].
Volunteers are exposed to experiments by randomly choosing one scenario
and by visiting the same page over H1 and H2 in unknown order. To avoid
biased ratings, only the website name is disclosed to users. Experiments have
been conducted in three sessions totaling to 147 volunteers who sampled a space
of 25 pages with 32 diﬀerent scenarios. We followed the best practices suggested
by “The Menlo Report” [2], and in particular those for network measurements [1].

E[PLT] [ms]
Fig. 4. Sub-linear dependency between PLT increase and MOS reduction.
identical non-cacheable images of 20 × 20 pixels (1.7 kB each), for a total of
630 kB. All the content is hosted on a single domain, mapped to a single IP
address and served by a single server. This scenario is particularly adverse to H1
since the browser opens a large number of connections, each incurring in TCP
and TLS handshake overhead and in TCP slow-start. In contrast, H2 takes full
advantage of its capabilities by pipelining all requests over multiple streams
encapsulated in a single TCP connection and by performing HPACK header
compression. We expect H2 to reduce the PLT, ultimately providing a better
WebQoE.
We use this toy page to validate the testbed and calibrate MOS grades. On
the one hand, we aim at verifying whether expectations on H2 performance are
satisﬁed. On the other hand, we aim at assessing the MOS gap between H2 and
H1 by using this extreme scenario as a litmus paper [16,18,20]. We consider 4
diﬀerent network setups, namely with RTT in {0, 20, 50, 100} ms, collecting 487
MOS samples in total. Figure 3 shows MOS (left plot) and PLT (right plot) for
H1 (red) and H2 (green). Each point corresponds to an experiment, adding jitter
(to x-y axis for MOS and to x axis only for PLT) to enhance the representation.
Consider Fig. 3a ﬁrst and notice that MOS consistently decreases with
increasing RTT. This holds for H1 and H2, with H2 providing a better experience
at both low and high latencies. Also, the diﬀerence (Δ) between the average of
H1 and H2 MOS grades is always of at least 1 point, increasing along with RTT.
Consider now Fig. 3b, showing PLT. H1 is signiﬁcantly more penalized than
H2, with PLT peaking at 8 s for RTT = 100 ms, while H2 keeps PLT below
2 s in all scenarios. As expected, H2 outperforms H1 PLT, meeting the original
design goal of “a 50% reduction in page load time” [11].
Next, we verify the existence of a sub-linear dependency of the subjec-
tive response to an objective impulse [20]. Here the impulse is the inﬂated
RTT (translating into a longer PLT), while the response is the MOS degra-
dation. Figure 4 reinterprets Fig. 3 as a scatter plot, where each point is the
(E[PLT], E[MOS]) pair over all samples for a given RTT. The ﬁgure also reports
the trend curve, clearly highlighting the expected sub-linear dependency.

A ﬁnal remark is that excellent MOS (i.e., 4 or higher) is bestow only to pages
with a loading time lower than 1.25 s. This is in line with [14], which classiﬁes
pages as reactive if they render the above-the-fold content in less then 1 s.
5 MOS on Real Pages
We here focus on real pages to compare H1 and H2 from a subjective perspective.
Our aim is to assess if and to what extent diﬀerences in user experience shown
earlier still hold in real-life scenarios. To do so, we consider a set of pages served
using multiple network and application conﬁgurations. On the one hand, we
revisit known results from the unique user MOS perspective. On the other
hand, we target the impact of less studied factors, such as implications of content
sharding [12] over multiple domains and diﬀerences caused by homogeneous vs
heterogeneous latency conditions towards servers.
5.1 Subjective MOS Diﬀerences
We start by assessing the per-user diﬀerence of H1 vs H2 MOS grades (ΔMOS)
for each page in the catalog. Figure 5 shows ΔMOS = MOSH2 − MOSH1 over all
tests, detailing both the empirical probability mass function (Fig. 5a) and the
per-page MOS diﬀerence (Fig. 5b). The ﬁgure is annotated with statistics (e.g.,
median) and visual references (e.g., light-gray area for H2 better than H1).
Some insightful observations can be drawn from the plot: The distribution
is (i) monomodal with zero mean and median, (ii) bell shaped, but (iii) slightly
skewed. In other words, (i) in 50% of cases, users equally score H2 and H1,
(ii) cases where either H2 or H1 has higher score are roughly balanced, although
