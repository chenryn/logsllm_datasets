User: I'm developing on google app engine.  The focus of this question is a python function that modifies hundreds of entity groups.  The function takes one string argument.  I want to execute this function as a transaction because there are instances right now when the same function with the same string argument are simultaneously run, resulting in unexpected results.  I want the function to execute in parallel if the string arguments are different, but not if the string arguments are the same, they should be run serially.
Is there a way to run a transaction on a function that modifies so many entity groups?  So far, the only solution I can think of is flipping a database flag for each unique string parameter, and checking for the flag (deferring execution if the flag is set as True).  Is there a more elegant solution?
Assistant: XG transactions are limited to a few entity groups for performance reasons. Running an XG transaction across hundreds of entity groups would be incredibly slow.
Can you break your function up into many sub-functions, one for each entity group? If so, you should have no trouble running them individually, or on the task queue.
