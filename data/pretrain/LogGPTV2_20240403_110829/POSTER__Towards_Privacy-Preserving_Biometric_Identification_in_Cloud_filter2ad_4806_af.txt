resistance against certain types of attacks such as spooﬁng attacks, where
it becomes increasingly diﬃcult for an impostor to spoof multiple biometric
modalities of an authorized user, Akhtar et al. [9]. A multibiometric design is
as a fault tolerant mechanism that continues to operate even when some of the
biometric traits are unreliable, Jain et al. [98].
There are diﬀerent sources that can be used in order to obtain multiple pieces of
biometric evidence from the same user, Ross et al. [182]. In multi-sensor designs,
a unimodal biometric is extracted by multiple sensors. For multi-algorithm
models, the same unimodal is processed by multiple extraction algorithms. This
approach has been mainly introduced as an eﬀective solution to reduce the cost
of the multi-sensor deployments, Kelkboom et al. [112]. Moreover, multi-instance
and multi-sample schemes use the same biometric trait captured by diﬀerent
angles or at multiple times such as the irises of the left and right eyes of a user
and their representations during the eye movement. Finally, multimodal designs
combine the evidences presented by diﬀerent body parts of the user to establish
his identity. In the biometric technology markets, vendors have already deployed
systems that use two or three patterns of face, ﬁngerprint or/and iris for the
same user, providing reliable recognition in many commercial applications,
Omotosho et al. [154]. Hybrid systems that implement both multimodal and
multi-algorithm approaches are also designed as an attempt to extract as much
information as possible from the various biometric characteristics of the user.
However, due to their complexity and cost, they are considered ineﬀective for
commercial applications, Li and Jain [122].
2.5.1
Information Fusion in Multibiometric Schemes
The concept of multibiometric integration and the selection of a convenient
fusion model is a challenging task, Meva and Kumbharana [143]. The design of
a multibiometric system is governed by several factors including the selected
sources of information, the acquisition and processing sequences, the types
of combined information and mostly the fusion strategy to be employed,
Ross and Jain in “Information fusion in biometrics” [180]. Data fusion in
multimodal systems is an active research area with numerous applications.
Fusion for multimodal architectures constitutes a way to solve the disadvantages
of unimodalities and to enhance the matching accuracy of the system without
22
BIOMETRICS
requiring additional measurements or techniques, but only using the biometric
features, Sasidhar et al. [188]. The diﬀerent approaches for the fusion of biometric
information in multibiometric designs are presented below.
Sensor Level Fusion. Fusion at this level involves the consolidation of user’s
biometric data presented by multiple sources before the fresh traits are subjected
to the feature extraction algorithm. This technique can beneﬁt multi-instance
and multi-sample systems that capture multiple forms of the same biometric
feature, Ross and Jain [180]. For this procedure, the sensor interface is designed
in a way that can avoid rotational oﬀsets between the slices in order to reduce
the complexity. This means that it is possible to construct a 3D face texture by
combining the evidence presented by 2D texture or 3D range images. According
to the experimental analysis of Ross et al. [182], the novelty of this approach
is the generation of a spherical projection that is eﬃcient when there is a
head motion in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, the matching
computation is more accurate in comparison to the unimodal facial schemes
that use a single template image.
Feature Level Fusion. Information fusion at feature level consolidates the
data extracted and presented by the biometric feature sets of the user. If
the datasets belong to the same characteristic and originate from the same
extraction algorithm then the feature level fusion can be used to update the
template. However, the combination of feature sets that are products of dissimilar
biometrics and follow diﬀerent extraction algorithms is not a trivial task, Xi
et al. [224]. The incompatibility of non-homogenous measures demands the
applicability of a normalization technique in order to handle the ﬁxed length
feature vectors and to perform computations on modalities that result in a
diﬀerent range. The augmentation of the vectors arising from the extractors
is also included in the process while the ﬁnal step is subjecting the vector to
a transformation algorithm. The correlation between the main inputs has to
be examined, in order to evaluate the improvements in matching performance,
Hamad et al. [85]. In spite of its complexity, this method is applicable in
multimodalities and it is eﬀective for multi-algorithm and multi-sensor schemes.
Score Level Fusion. In this level of fusion, matching scores are returned
by each individual subsystem and the obtained output results are combined.
However, it is necessary to use speciﬁc normalization techniques in order
to achieve uniform matching scores from distinct sensors, uncorrelated
unimodal data and diﬀerent extraction, representation algorithms. State-of-
the-art research presents a large number of normalization mechanisms. Score
level techniques are classiﬁed into three main subcategories: density-based,
transformation-based and classiﬁer-based schemes, Ross and Jain [180]. The
performance of each scheme depends on the quantity and quality of the
available information. Score level fusion, also known as fusion at measurement
MULTIBIOMETRIC SYSTEMS
23
or conﬁdence level is a popular and widely used technique in current multimodal
biometric architectures due to its reliability, Ross et al. [182]. It provides an
improved recognition performance in comparison to other methods, while it
allows an easy integration for modalities extracted by disparate sensors, Jain et
al. [101]. Recently, Tiwari and Gupta introduced a score level fusion scheme and
tested it for diﬀerent biometric datasets [206]. Their experimental evaluation
presents a strong authentication accuracy with low error rates in comparison to
the performance of the unimodal subsystems.
Decision Level Fusion. This level of information fusion is termed as such
because it depends on the ﬁnal acceptance or rejection decisions. This type
of fusion strongly depends on the application and the functionality of the
involved subsystems. Gathering the information by the independent components
of the scheme, and fusing the results, constitutes an approach to increase the
overall precision, supporting the idea of universality in multimodal architectures,
Podio [166]. However, this fusion method presents several inconveniences that
reduce its applicability in multimodal applications. Techniques proposed in
the literature include the Daugman rules, majority voting conditions, Bayesian
decision, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence and behavior knowledge space
that present high values of FAR and FRR, resulting a lower accuracy according
to the ﬁndings of Rathgeb and Busch [172], Tao and Veldhuis [203]. The research
in this area is still immature, while recent works study the approaches for
fusion at the decision level for the incorporation of multiple soft biometric
characteristics into a multimodal system for its applicability to biometric
identiﬁcation systems, Cavoukian and Stoianov [48] and Guo et al. [80].
Figure 2.6 illustrates the levels of information fusion and the recognition stages
in multibiometric designs. The evaluation of a system that incorporates multiple
biometric features is complex and requires the user’s cooperation. Compact
multibiometric templates need to be generated, oﬀering in this way enough
information of high quality for the recognition of the user. In the literature, there
are many approaches for fusion of biometric data in multimodal recognition
schemes and the majority of them are still on a theoretical level. The most
important limitation for the evaluation and consequently the applicability of
fusion techniques in real-world schemes is the lack of available for examination
datasets. This problem is especially pronounced in the case of a biometric system
operating in the identiﬁcation mode with a large number of enrolled users.
Moreover, the European Regulatory Technical Standards for Strong Customer
Authentication [183], following the new European GDPR [66] underlines the
necessity to address the concerns for user privacy when his multimodal data are
stored in Centralized Biometric Databases (CBDBs). Finally, the precision of
the multimodal model distributions and the evaluation of the overall accuracy
are still intricate issues, Lejbølle et al. [119].

2.6 Evaluation of Biometric Systems
From an engineering perspective, the evaluation of biometric schemes is a
challenging task. In order to gain a thorough understanding of the performance
accuracy of a biometric system, we need to consider the eﬀectiveness of the data
extraction, representation and matching techniques, Jain et al. [98], Maltoni
EVALUATION OF BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS
25
et al. [131] and Ross et al. [182]. Additionally, we need to assess the risks
regarding the privacy of the users and examine the robustness of the currently
used cryptographic methods in the application domain where the scheme is
about to be embedded, di Vimercati et al. [63]. In this way, we will be able
to provide the tools for privacy-by-design approaches in biometric recognition
that follow the legal framework for the protection of private data, Kindt [115].
Campisi et al. [40], Kindt [116] and Phillips et al. [165] underline that there is
no evaluation framework to study these issues in a systematic manner. However,
in concrete terms we need to address the following questions:
• What is the optimum matching algorithm and how eﬃcient can it be applied
to encrypted biometric data?
• What is the impact of speciﬁc complications such as the sample population
and data collection environment on the performance accuracy and the
scalability of the design, during the experimental studies on representative
standardized biometric DBs?
• What is the accuracy of the technical performance of the biometric system
in a given application?
• What is the user acceptability of the system? How does the architecture
address the human factor issues such as user habituation?
• What level of security does the biometric system provide to the application
in which it is embedded? How eﬀective is the applied cryptographic technique
to protect the biometric data?
• What are the security limitations of the biometric system? How we can
perform a complete risk assessment and map the vulnerabilities under realistic
scenarios?
• How does the system address the privacy concerns of its users regarding their
personal information?
• What are the technical and practical constraints to preserve privacy with
respect to the recommendations of the legal framework for the protection of
biometric data?
• What is the availability and maintainability of the system?
• What is the cost and throughput of the biometric system and what tangible
beneﬁts can be derived from its deployment as a return on investment?
Our contribution. In this thesis, we are mainly focused on multimodal designs
due to their eﬃciency, practicality and applicability in the next generation high
security biometric systems. However, our research included approaches for user
authentication based on unimodal biometrics and multi-factor schemes. It is
noted that the number of methodologies for the data extraction, collection,
representation and the available in the literature matching algorithms is
26
BIOMETRICS
quasi endless. Studies on how pattern recognition techniques can improve
the performance reliability fall outside the scope of this thesis.
Performance rates are important indicators for a biometric design while they
deﬁne its accuracy. Moreover, fusion of biometric modalities is a challenging
task for the functionality of a secure multimodal design. In a fusion model,
the performance rates can be applied in such a way that diﬀerent weights are
assigned to the various modalities on a user-by-user basis, Ross et al. [181]. In
our works [208] and [209], we showed how these rates can be applied in fusion
strategies to increase the performance accuracy of multimodal designs. In these
studies, presented also in Part II, we exploited score level fusion approaches
and we analytically presented their advantages related to the performance
improvement and the security targets of our proposed recognition schemes.
Finally, we introduced in [207] a system for remote multimodal authentication.
Hamming Distance techniques and a user-speciﬁc weighted score level fusion
method were used in order to incorporate unimodal datasets of three biometric
modalities (face, ﬁngerprint, iris) into a ﬁnal fused result for user recognition.
Our experimental analysis justiﬁed our selection of this fusion approach in terms
of computation eﬃciency, cost and reliability.

Methodologies for the
Protection of Biometric Data
In this chapter, we present an overview of the mechanisms for securing biometric
architectures. Security issues are deﬁned while we also discuss how spooﬁng
attacks in biometric recognition schemes diﬀer from other vulnerabilities.
Additionally, we address the topic of biometric data protection from a privacy
perspective discussing the privacy principles and requirements. We analyze the
cryptographic approaches that have been developed to prevent impersonation
and the exposure of biometric information with respect to security and privacy
while we also present our conducted research and contributions.
3.1 Vulnerabilities of Biometric Systems
In 2001, the main security concerns related to biometric-based recognition
designs were highlighted, Ratha et al. [171]. Since then, a complete collection of
targeted attacks has been presented and it has been shown that a system can
be vulnerable either due to an intrinsic failure or because of intentional attacks,
Linnartz and Tuyls [125], Rathgeb and Uhl [174].
For the vulnerabilities related to the intrinsic failures, accuracy and robustness
are the main performance metrics of a biometric architecture, as explained in
Section 2.4. This means that a system that is characterized by a high FAR
is very prone to be breached since it is likely to accept an attacker with an
arbitrary biometric feature. Performance metrics are usually related to intrinsic
27
28
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
failures or referred to as zero-eﬀort attacks, Jain et al. [100]. However, this fact
depends on the quality of the biometric modality and the applied extraction,
representation and matching algorithms. This justiﬁes the selection of speciﬁc
types of biometrics, such as face, ﬁngerprint and iris data due to their properties
and reliability for security demanding applications in order to avoid as much as
possible potential intrinsic failures.
Secondly, Figure 3.1 illustrates the most common intentional attacks that can
take place against the building blocks of a biometric authentication scheme,
adapted from Campisi [39].
Figure 3.1: Attacks in biometric authentication schemes.
• Sensor: Attacks aimed directly towards the biometric sensor are usually
referred to as direct attacks, Martinez-Diaz et al. [139]. A coercitive attack
may happen when a true biometric is presented by an impostor who forces
a legitimate user to grant him access to the system. Spooﬁng and mimicry
attacks are related to the reproduction of the biometric features of an
enrolled user by means of diﬀerent strategies that are presented as inputs
by an impostor in order to fool the system. Device substitution is referred
to the substitution of a legitimate biometric device with a modiﬁed or
replacement capture unit. Finally, denial of service is another mode of attack
in which an impostor overwhelms the biometric system with massive requests.
VULNERABILITIES OF BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS
29
Consequently, a system can be loaded with so many access requests, to a point
that may cause its failure while all the involved computation subsystems can
no longer handle valid users.
• Feature extraction: This process can be forced by an attacker to produce
preselected biometric features by an insertion of impostor data or a component
replacement which is referred to the substitution of either the software or
hardware components of the system in order to control its behavior and
produce speciﬁc feature sets.
• Database: The stored templates can be either local or remote. The data
might be distributed over several servers. At this level, an attacker may
try to read the templates, replace/modify one or more stored records in the
DB or change the links between the biometric data and the users’ personal
credentials such as name. These may cause the acceptance of an intruder
as an authorized user or the denial of the service to the enrolled persons
associated with the corrupted templates. Attacks on biometric DBs are seen
as very serious as they are related to the user privacy, Yang et al. [227]. As
presented in Section 3.3, several mechanisms can be found in the literature
as a primary goal to enhance the security of stored biometric templates.
• Matching process: The matcher can be attacked or corrupted in order to
produce preselected scores. This can be achieved by inserting impostor data,
replacing a component or manipulating the match score, where an intruder
inserts or changes the values of the score by manipulating the computational
result or by substituting the software/hardware components of the system
before the ﬁnal decision. Guessing attack and hill-climbing are referred
to as iterative attacks that can be performed when an intruder, given an
input, constantly tries to modify the score in order to surpass the decision
threshold, Maltoni et al. [131]. State-of-the-art research present numerous
approaches for enhancing the security of unimodal and multimodal biometric
authentication schemes against hill-climbing attacks, Higo et al. [87] and
Maiorana et al. [129].
• Channels: Channels interconnecting the sensor and the feature extractor
or located between the feature extractor and the matcher can be intercepted
and controlled by an attacker. In an eavesdropping attack an intruder listens
to the transmission of the biometric data. In a replay attack, a recorded
signal is replayed to the system, bypassing the sensor. In a man in the middle
attack, an attacker is able to manipulate the feature sets exchanged between
two parties without the parties knowing that the link has been compromised.
In local authentication designs the two stages of feature extraction and
matching are inseparable and this attack is considered to be extremely
