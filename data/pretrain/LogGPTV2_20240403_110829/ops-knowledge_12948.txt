User: How to design an enterprise-level application based on microservice architecture? What aspects and technology options need to be considered?
Assistant: Designing an enterprise-level application based on a microservice architecture requires consideration of the following aspects and technology selection: 1. Service splitting: The application needs to be split into multiple services, each with independent business functions and data storage. 2. Communication protocol: It is necessary to select an appropriate communication protocol for communication between services, such as RESTful or RPC. 3. Deployment method: You need to choose an appropriate deployment method to deploy and manage services, such as containerized deployment or virtualized deployment. 4. Data consistency: It is necessary to consider how to ensure data consistency between services, such as two-phase commit protocol or eventual consistency protocol. 5. Core technology: It is necessary to choose the appropriate core technology to build services, such as Spring Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker, etc. 6. Integration testing: Integration testing is required to ensure collaboration and overall performance between services. 7. Security: You need to consider how to ensure the security between services, such as OAuth2 or JWT. 8. Monitoring and logging: It is necessary to select appropriate monitoring and logging technologies to monitor the running status and performance of services. 9. Database selection: It is necessary to select a suitable database to store the data required by the service, such as MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. 10. Operation and maintenance automation: It is necessary to select appropriate tools and technologies to realize automatic deployment and operation and maintenance management, such as Jenkins, Ansible, etc.
