### 3.2.3 AS-Path Poisoning and Traffic Interception

We conducted an AS-path poisoning attack to evaluate the feasibility of intercepting encrypted traffic. First, we observed the AS path and next hop used by the Amsterdam Internet Exchange for the victim’s prefix. We then set up a static route to forward all traffic destined for the victim’s prefix to the recorded next hop, with the exception of traffic from the IP address used by a Certificate Authority (CA) for domain control verification.

Next, we made a route announcement for a sub-prefix containing the victim’s domain, with every AS between the adversary and the victim prepended to the AS path. Since the announcement was for a sub-prefix, all ASes routed traffic to the adversary, except for the ASes between the adversary and the victim, which did not adopt the announcement due to loop prevention. This allowed the adversary to forward all traffic to the victim without affecting global connectivity.

With the traffic forwarding in place, we approached a CA and requested a certificate. The traffic from the CA's server was not forwarded to the victim but instead answered by the adversary’s server, enabling us to obtain a trusted TLS certificate without impacting the victim’s connectivity. We deployed this certificate on a web server controlled by the adversary. Finally, we removed the routing rule for traffic forwarding to the victim and answered HTTPS requests using the adversary’s web server.

| CA | Time to Issue | Validation Method | Attacked |
|----|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Let's Encrypt | 35s | HTTP | Yes |
| GoDaddy | 51s | Email | Yes |
| Comodo | 6min | Email | Yes |
| Symantec | 4min | Email | Yes |
| GlobalSign | <10min | HTTP | Yes |

**Table 3:** The five CAs we attacked and obtained certificates from. We found that all CAs were automated and none had any defenses against BGP attacks.

To measure the impact of this attack on real users, we simulated an innocuous user of the victim’s domain by continuously running HTTPS AJAX calls. We observed that, without any interruption in connectivity, the AJAX calls went from being securely sent to the victim’s server to being intercepted by the adversary. We executed this attack in as little as 35 seconds, from BGP announcement to HTTPS traffic decryption.

### 3.3 Certificate Authorities Attacked

In addition to various BGP attacks, we assessed the vulnerability of different CAs to BGP attacks aimed at obtaining fraudulent certificates. Table 3 lists the CAs we approached for certificates. For each CA, we launched a sub-prefix hijack attack against a victim’s HTTP or email server, depending on the CA’s preferred verification method. Since the sub-prefix hijack is the most detectable attack, if a CA does not notice such an attack and signs a certificate, it indicates a lack of BGP defense mechanisms.

We also recorded relevant server logs to check if CAs fetched resources from multiple IP addresses, indicating the deployment of multiple vantage points. No CAs had such countermeasures in place. We noted the speed at which each CA issued a certificate. All CAs signed our requests automatically, allowing an adversary to obtain a certificate very rapidly. Since our experiment, Let's Encrypt has implemented one of our suggested countermeasures.

**Notes:**
1. As detailed in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, we also performed BGP equally-specific-prefix attacks and AS-Path poisoning attacks against a chosen CA, not all CAs.
2. The longer delay from several CAs is due to the time it took to manually request certificates through their web interfaces.
3. No vantage points were deployed at the time of the attack. Let's Encrypt has since implemented multiple vantage point verification in their staging environment, where it is being tested before full release.

### 3.4 Attacks on Victim DNS

In addition to spoofing HTTP/Email domain verification by hijacking the victim’s servers, we targeted the victim’s DNS server. After capturing traffic to the victim’s authoritative DNS server, we ran an adversarial DNS server configured to provide fake A records for the victim’s domain. When the CA performed a DNS lookup for HTTP/Email verification, our adversarial DNS server responded with the IP of the adversary’s server, causing the CA to send the request to the adversary’s server instead of the victim’s server.

### 3.5 Ethical Considerations

During these experiments, we ensured no harm or interference with real users or websites by adhering to the following guidelines:
1. We only requested certificates for domains registered specifically for this experiment, ensuring no real users were affected.
2. We made BGP announcements for IP prefixes allocated to us through the PEERING testbed, ensuring no other Internet traffic was affected.
3. We did not generate any network traffic with a source address we did not control (source IP spoofing).

By following these guidelines, our experiments used real Internet infrastructure without affecting real users. In this section, we demonstrate real-world BGP attacks that successfully obtain fraudulent certificates from the five largest CAs. We show that network-level adversaries can undermine the security properties of HTTPS by targeting domain validation protocols and attacking users who believe they are visiting a secure site. This motivates our work in Section 5 on developing countermeasures to prevent such attacks.

### 4. Quantifying Vulnerability of Domains and CAs

The vulnerability of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to the attacks outlined above depends on factors such as the topological relationship between the adversary and the victim and the length of the victim’s prefix. We aim to measure these factors and quantitatively assess the viability of the attacks. Specifically, we analyze what fraction of certificate signings could have been spoofed using one of the attacks above. Our measurements reveal that 72% of domains are vulnerable to sub-prefix attacks (launchable by any AS on the Internet). All domains are vulnerable to an equally-specific-prefix attack from an average of 70% of ASes on the Internet (specific to any given victim domain).

#### 4.1 Data Collection

To gather data about TLS domains, we scraped the Certificate Transparency logs through crt.sh [4] and resolved the domain names in the common name field of certificates to an IP address. For each certificate, we resolved the common name to an IP address using our local DNS resolver. We then mapped the IP address to the IP prefix and origin AS using Level3’s routing table from the time the certificate was issued. We chose 10 of the 14 top CAs listed on W3Techs CA usage survey from November 17, 2017 [8] for our study. These 10 CAs were selected for their consistent logging of Domain Validated (DV) certificates to Certificate Transparency. We filtered out domains that failed to resolve to an IP address. Due to the large volume of certificates, we rate-limited our certificate scraping. Over the period between March 11, 2017, and August 7, 2017, we generated a dataset of 1.8 million certificates after filtering.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability to Sub-Prefix Attacks

We first evaluate the vulnerability to sub-prefix attacks, where the adversary AS announces a longer prefix than the original prefix. We assess the vulnerability of both domains and CAs to such attacks.

##### 4.2.1 Vulnerability of Domains

Because most ASes filter BGP announcements to prefixes longer than /24, only domains running on prefixes shorter than /24 are vulnerable to sub-prefix attacks. Our data shows that 72% of domains (1.3 million in our dataset) requesting certificates ran on prefixes shorter than /24 at the time of requesting the certificate. Figure 4 shows the complete distribution of domains over different IP prefix lengths. Thus, a sub-prefix hijack/interception attack is highly viable on the PKI.

**Remark:** While previous works on BGP attacks in other applications have recommended that ASes announce /24s to prevent sub-prefix attacks [44, 45], this is not feasible for domain owners. Given the large number of domains with TLS certificates, running every domain on a /24 would cause a significant increase in the BGP routing table. Therefore, in the absence of feasible countermeasures, 72% of domains remain vulnerable to sub-prefix attacks, motivating our work on designing new countermeasures for PKI in Section 5.

##### 4.2.2 Vulnerability of CAs

CAs are also targets for attacks. Of the five CAs we attacked, only one (Comodo) used a /24 prefix for the IP used for verification. Table 4 shows the IPs used by CAs for verification and the prefix length for each IP. We also show the originating AS and the number of providers (including tier 1 networks) of the originating AS. Unlike the large number of domains, there is a relatively small number of CAs, making it reasonable for CAs to run the IPs used for domain control verification on a /24 prefix to avoid sub-prefix hijacks. Additionally, Comodo and GoDaddy operate their own ASes, meaning that running the verification servers on a /24 IP prefix would require only an update in routing policy. For CAs that do not control their own BGP announcements, we recommend negotiations with relevant ISPs because running domain control verification servers on /24 IP prefixes provides significant security benefits with minimal additional cost, as explained in Section 2.2.1.

#### 4.3 Vulnerability to Equally-Specific-Prefix Hijacking

To assess the vulnerability of domains and CAs to equally-specific-prefix attacks, we used the notion of resilience [31]. An AS of a CA \( v \) is resilient to an attack launched by a false origin AS \( a \) on a victim domain AS \( t \), if \( v \) is not deceived by \( a \) and still sends its traffic to \( t \). For a given \((v, a, t)\) pair, resilience is calculated by:

\[
\bar{\beta}(t, v, a) = \frac{p(v, t)}{p(v, t) + p(v, a)}
\]

**Table 4:** This table shows the IPs used by various CAs to perform domain control verification.

| CA | IP Used | IP Prefix | Origin AS | Number of Providers | Tier 1 Providers | Resilience (Section 4.3.2) |
|----|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Comodo | 64.78.149.164 | /20 | AS30060 | 4 | 0 | 0.887 |
| GoDaddy | 68.178.177.122 | /20 | AS4713 | 4 | 0 | 0.731 |
| Let's Encrypt | 91.199.212.132 | /22 | AS26496 | 4 | 0 | 0.217 |
| Symantec | 69.58.183.55 | /11 | AS4713 | 4 | 1 | 0.440 |
| GlobalSign | 114.179.250.1 | /24 | AS48447 | 4 | 0 | 0.587 |
