Consider:
    class Apple {
        private size: number;
        constructor(size: number) {
            this.size = size;
        }
        get Size(): number {
            return this.size;
        }
    }
    let a: Apple = new Apple(4);
    console.log(a.Size);
    a.Size = 5; // should this should throw a compile time error?
It strikes me that the attempted assignment to `a.Size` should produce a
compile time error.
Instead we learn about it at runtime (target `es6` with `v1.6.0-dev.20150806`)
    [Error: Cannot set property Size of # which has only a getter]
Thoughts?
