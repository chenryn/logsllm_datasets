is voiceprinted.
No Owner Interaction. We assume that the target device
is placed on a medium that allows acoustic transmission,
such as a tabletop, and it is not being actively used by the
user. For smart home devices, the owner often interacts with
it less than a dozen times a day. For mobile phones and
tablets, it is also fairly common the owner is focusing on
other activities not related to the device, such as reading books,
having conversations with friends, working on a computer, etc.
Hidden Attack. One goal of the adversary is to attack
voice assistants without being detected. The adversary will
send the voice commands in ultrasonic frequencies that are
inaudible to humans, and at the same time, turn down the
volume of the device to the extent that it would be difﬁcult
for the users to notice the voice responses from the assistant,
yet a hidden tapping device placed underneath the table can
record them.
Attack Equipment. We assume that adversaries possess
both the Piezoelectric (PZT) transducer designed for exciting
ultrasonic guided wave and commodity devices for generating
command signals. An ultrasonic signal source made of PZT
transducer is relatively small and can generally be concealed
and attached to a physical medium, such as the bottom of a
table.
III. KEY ELEMENTS OF SurﬁngAttack
There are three necessary conditions for the success of
SurﬁngAttack: (1) The ultrasonic wave in the table must be
able to reach the device microphone embodied in the device
enclosure. (2) Even when the microphone may not be in direct
contact with the transmission medium, the wave should still be
able to leverage the non-linearity of the device microphone on
the tabletop to launch the inaudible command injection attacks.
(3) The response from the victim device can be received by
the attacker via the planted device without raising suspicion
of the victim user. More speciﬁcally, the volume of victim’s
device can be tuned down such that user cannot notice it, yet
the response can be recorded by a tapping device beneath the
table.
A. Attack Wave Mode Selection and Generation
The ﬁrst condition for the attack is the capability to deliver
inaudible ultrasound waves to the target device effectively.
Different from waves in air, the acoustic waves propagating in
solid materials have acoustic dispersion phenomenon, during
which a sound wave separates into its component frequencies
as it passes through the material. Lower dispersion indicates
a better concentration of acoustic energy. This implies that a
proper Lamb wave mode for SurﬁngAttack should feature (1)
low dispersion, (2) low attenuation, (3) easy excitability [46],
and (4) high attack signal reachability. To achieve the afore-
mentioned features, there are three key design decisions: the
signal waveform, Lamb wave mode, and the ultrasound signal
source.
First, guided wave signals can be generated via either
windowed modulation or pulse signals. It has been shown
that narrowband input signals are most effective in restricting

which depends on three material parameters: E is the Young’s
module, v is the Poisson ratio, and ρ is the density of plate
material.
The solutions of A, B, C, D in Eq. (5) and Eq. (7)
require the determinants of the two matrices to vanish, which
leads to the Rayleigh-Lamb equations (omitted for brevity) for
the plate. The Rayleigh-Lamb equations quantify the relation
between the angular frequency ω and the phase velocity Cp of
the guided wave in the plate, where Cp is the propagation speed
of the wave phase at a particular frequency within the guided
wave signals. Cp relates to the wavenumber k: Cp = ω/k.
According to Rayleigh-Lamb equations, Lamb waves exhibit
velocity dispersion; i.e., their propagation velocity depends on
the frequency (or wavelength) and material parameters.
The phase-velocity dispersion curve, which depicts the
correlation between the phase velocity and the frequency
thickness product (i.e., the product of wave’s angular frequency
and material thickness, ωh), is plotted in Fig. 3 for a glass
plate. We notice that with the increasing frequency thickness,
more propagation modes appear, i.e., more types of waves
with different transmission speeds will be propagating in the
material and interfering with each other. As a result, the center
frequency and guided wave mode of attack signals should
be carefully selected based on attack target information ex-
tracted from guided wave sensitivity studies. Different guided
wave modes introduce different wave propagation formats that
could signiﬁcantly impact the effectiveness of attack signal
delivery, and the details of mode selection are presented in
Section III-A.
C. Threat Model
The attacker’s goal is to remotely converse with victim’s
voice controllable device to inject unauthorized voice com-
mands or to access sensitive information without victim’s
knowledge. We assume the victim is familiar with his/her
surrounding. This can be his/her own ofﬁce or home, and
he/she can notice any physical alteration.
Physical Access. We assume that adversaries can place a
small attack device in the physical space of the device as long
as it is not visible to the user. We assume that an adversary
cannot physically touch the victim’s devices, alter the device
settings, or install malware apps. The activation commands
(“Hey Siri”, “OK Google”) of voice assistants are generally
voice ﬁngerprinted,
i.e., user veriﬁcation is performed to
authenticate these commands. We assume the attacker can
synthesize the legitimate user’s voice signals using known
4
wave dispersal in large and thick plates [50]. As a result,
narrowband windowed modulation signals is used to carry the
attack command in SurﬁngAttack to minimize dispersion.
Second, different Lamb wave modes have different ﬁeld
distributions throughout the whole plate [11], depending on
the different frequency-thickness and materials parameters as
shown in Fig. 3. Since the attack frequency range from 20
kHz to 40 kHz has the best performance in stimulating the
microphone’s non-linearity effect, we are limited to the lower-
order Lamb wave modes, i.e., A0 or S0 mode. In order to
succeed in the attacks, the Lamb wave should be able to spread
from a point of the table to the victim’s device on the tabletop
effectively. As a result, the generated Lamb waves need to
produce a high out-of-plane displacement2 on the table surface.
As most of the displacement of the A0 mode is out-of-plane,
while most of the displacement of the S0 mode is in-plane3
with lower frequency-thickness products. A0 wave mode below
the cut-off frequencies of the higher order Lamb wave modes
is selected to create the ultrasound commands.
Lastly, we choose to use a circular piezoelectric disc
to generate the signal for its energy efﬁciency and omni-
directivity. It applies a vertical force towards the table surface,
resulting in a ﬂexural wave propagating radially outwards and
thus enabling an omni-directional attack through the table.
The energy efﬁciency is important since the piezoelectric disc
that
is hidden under the solid materials needs to produce
strong waves to reach extended distances with a minimal
amount of energy. The omni-directivity is crucial because
the attack should work regardless where the target’s location
and orientation are on the medium, i.e., wherever your phone
is placed on the table. The omni-directivity of the attack is
evaluated in Section VI-C. Furthermore, since objects on the
table surface could change frequently, we need to make sure
that the signal propagation still works regardless of whether
there are objects on the table. The corresponding evaluation is
presented in Section VI-G.
B. Triggering Non-linearity Effect via Solid Medium
While the non-linearity has been demonstrated for ultra-
sound wave that is directly delivered to the speaker via air, it is
unclear if it is feasible to trigger the same effect when acoustic
waves pass through the table materials to reach the external
enclosure of the phone. We conduct extensive experiments to
verify if the non-linearity effect of the voice capture hardware
of a smartphone placed on the tabletop can be triggered by the
ultrasonic guided waves that propagate in the table. The setup
for one of the initial experiments is shown in Fig. 4.
We use a low-cost radial mode vibration PZT disc [45]
(which only costs $5 per piece) with 22 mm diameter and 0.25
mm thickness to generate the ultrasonic guided wave. The disc
is adhered to the underside of an aluminum plate with 3 mm
thickness. The size of the PZT transducer is much smaller than
the ultrasound speaker used in existing attacks [42], [44], [52],
making the attacks more stealthy and economically accessible,
as shown in Fig. 4(b). We use a chirp signal from 50 Hz to

5 kHz as the baseband signal. The baseband signal is then
imported to a Keysight 33500B series waveform generator and
modulated onto a carrier. The 9V output is then supplied to
the PZT transducer to excite Lamb waves. By analyzing the
recorded signal of a smartphone (i.e., Google Pixel), the non-
linearity of microphones could be evaluated.
Fig. 5 shows the spectrogram of the baseband signal
and the recorded signal when carrier frequency fc = 25.3
kHz. The ultrasonic guided wave propagates to the device
microphone and any resulted sound is recorded. The results
conﬁrm the existence of the nonlinear response of the voice
capture hardware incited by ultrasonic guided waves. Fig. 5(b)
shows the recorded sound signal in the time-frequency domain,
in which the ﬁrst harmonic component is almost identical to the
original signal displayed in Fig. 5(a). This result demonstrates
the feasibility of attacking voice controllable systems placed
on the tabletop through ultrasonic guided waves.
C. Unnoticeable Response
Unnoticeable response of a target phone is critical for
keeping the attack under the radar. Sound pressure level (SPL)
is used to quantify the sound pressure of a sound relative to a
reference pressure at the eardrums of our hearing or on the
diaphragms of the microphones. SPL is determined by the
corresponding audio voltage, while standard reference sound
pressure p0 = 20 µ Pa ≡ 0 dB is the quietest sound a human
can perceive [49].

surement and point-shaped sound sources in the free ﬁeld. We
assume r1 as the distance between the tapping device and the
sound source, r2 as the distance between the user and the sound
source. L1 and L2 are SPLs at the tapping device and the user
end, the relationship of which follows the inverse distance law
as written below:
L2 = L1 −

(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .
(cid:18) r1
r2
Approximately, an SPL drop of 6 dB is expected by doubling
the difference of r1 and r2. When SPL at the user end drops
below 0 dB, the voice response becomes essentially inaudible
to the user. Thus, it becomes feasible to conceal SurﬁngAttack
by adjusting the volume of the device via ultrasonic guide
wave and placing a hidden tapping device closer to the victim’s
device underneath the table. Note that the inverse distance
law is always an idealization because it assumes exactly equal
sound pressure as sound ﬁeld propagates in all directions. If
there are reﬂective surfaces in the sound ﬁeld, the reﬂected
sounds will be added to the direct sound, resulting in a higher
SPL at a ﬁeld location than the inverse distance law predicts.
If there are barriers between the source and the point of
measurement, we may get a lower SPL.
To validate the feasibility, we evaluate the SPL of a Google
Pixel phone at different volumes, the results of which are
shown in Fig. 6. Here, we let
the phone produce 1 kHz
sinusoidal tones with low volume levels, and an A-weighting
SPL meter is used to measure SPL at various distances. The
experiment is conducted in a quiet ofﬁce (about 400 square
feet) with an average background noise of 40.5 dB. Although
the SPL stays above 0 dB, it decreases with distance, and
the signal is quickly overwhelmed by environmental noise
after propagating 50∼100 cm at volume level 1∼3. We also
deployed a microphone as a tapping device underneath the
table, which is proven capable of recording the weak voice
responses. The results show that it is feasible for the attacker
to adjust the volume low enough to make the voice responses
unnoticeable by the user from a moderate distance, while a
hidden tapping device can still capture the sound. To enhance
the sound capturing capability, we can deploy multiple tapping
devices at different positions under the table to precisely
capture the weak voice responses from the device speaker as
well. In an environment with larger background noise, we can
adjust volume even higher without alerting the owner. Lastly,
the attacker can turn off the screen to further enhance the
stealthiness of the threat. In Section V-D, we run extensive
experiments to corroborate the stealthiness of SurﬁngAttack
by measuring the responses of victim phones in different
environments.
IV. ATTACK DESIGN
To enable interactive hidden attacks, SurﬁngAttack gen-
erates well-crafted ultrasonic guided wave commands such
that they can propagate along the table to control the voice
assistants. The attack system is designed to initiate commands,
record voice responses, and interact with victim devices.
Without loss of generality, we will present our system design
details using Google Assistant as a case study, and the same
methodology applies to other voice assistants (Siri, Bixby).

different volumes (Volume 0 represents background noise).

A. Attack Overview for SurﬁngAttack
Fig. 7 shows the system overview of the attack, where
the attacker planted the SurﬁngAttack device in the physical
environment of the victim, and the controller that supports the
major functionality is remotely connected off-site. Note that
the controller can be included in the SurﬁngAttack device as
well, however, that could change the computation requirement
and form factor of the SurﬁngAttack device. The SurﬁngAttack
device contains three main components: a signal processing
module, an ultrasonic transducer, and a tapping device, as
shown in Fig. 7. The primary function of the SurﬁngAttack
device is to enable the collection of voice device output and
the delivery of malicious commands via inaudible ultrasound.
The general workﬂow is as follows.
The voice commands or dialogues are generated using
the speech synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) Module. The
controller produces the baseband signals v(t) of the voice
commands or dialogues, and then transmits them to the attack
device preferably through wireless, e.g., WiFi. The attack
