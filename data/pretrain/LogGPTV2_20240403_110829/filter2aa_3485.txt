Phase 0: Preparations
Make sure the radio to be converted is in good working order on its original frequencies 
before attempting conversion to Amateur Radio use.  If the radio does not make at least 
3 watts of output power, do not proceed with conversion until repairs are made. 
Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming
Hack the original GE PCS Plus v6.0 software to allow out of range programming.
Copy PCSP.EXE to PCSP220.EXE
Using a suitable hex editor such as XVI32, Edit PCSP220.EXE and make the following 
changes:
Hex Address
Original Data
New Data
&H1F778
16
00
&H1F77C
2E
61
This changes the programming range of the software to allow 128 to 225 MHz. Transmit 
frequencies will show true, Receive frequencies will now have to be programmed minus 
90 MHz. I.E. 223.500 MHz RX is now programmed as 133.500 MHz.
For testing program the radio to the following:
Channel 1 – 223.500 MHz Simplex, 100 Hz PL Encode, High Power
Channel 2 – 223.500 MHz Simplex, 100 Hz PL Encode, Low Power
Phase 2: VCO
Open the radio and remove the Rear assembly. Torx T-10 is used as well as a straight 
screw driver to pry along the edges.
The BNC connector is removed by first loosening the Alan set screw (0.050) on the rear 
casing. Desolder the center pin from the strap coming off of the RF board and unscrew 
the BNC connector from the chassis. A BNC Tee adapter makes a good tool to grip the 
connector when removing or installing into the chassis.
Cut the trace on the RF board, feeding the /PTT signal to the VCO assembly.
Install a logic inverter consisting of a surface mount NPN transistor with a 10K 1/8 W 
resistor on the base lead. Solder emitter to ground, base resistor to P801, pin 7 and the 
collector to the solder pad just after the spot that was cut.
Installed VCO Inverter Transistor
This effectively makes the VCO band select backwards so the VCO runs in the 222 
MHz range on TX and around 178 MHz on RX.
Phase 3: Low Pass Filter
Remove the 33nH inductor at position L107 and replace with 22nH. Wind 3 ½ turns of 
#22 wire on a 3/32” drill bit.
The magnet wire is available from Radio Hut in the 315 ft. Magnet Wire Kit #278-1345, 
#22 is the spool that is gold in color. Remove the enamel from the ends of the coil and 
tin it. I like to do both operations at once with a pool of solder on the end of a broad 
tipped iron. Leave the coil on the drill bit while tinning to act as a heat sink.
Phase 4: Receiver
Install 4-40 - 3/8” Brass screws in inductors L401, L402, L403 and L404. On some 
versions of LBI-38275, L404 is called L454 on the parts placement diagram. Gently 
insert the screws all the way in to the coil forms.
Remove Z401. This is a tuned hybrid filter set to cover 136-174 MHz.  The RF shielding 
surrounding the filter can be easily removed by peeling the metal away with needle 
nose pliers and side cutters.
The filter can be bypassed with a single piece of wire bridged across the input and 
output pads. Leave enough height so that the wire does not come into contact with the 
ground holes. The image frequency rejection is only 6-8dB with the wire so it is 
recommended to replace the front end filter.
A replacement image rejection filter may be constructed with the following components:
2 x 4.7pF capacitors
1 x 90 degree open coax stub cut to 133.5 MHz + 0.5” (15.25” for RG-174u)
Replacement Image Filter Schematic
Install the new filter in the original position of Z401. Solder the capacitors to the I/O 
holes of Z401 and solder the outer conductor of the coax stub to ground.
Replacement Image Filter Measured Performance
Phase 5a: 5W VHF Power Amplifier Replacement
MHW607-4 is specified for operation at 184 - 210 MHz. This would be a drop in 
replacement for the MHW607-2 that is currently in the radio, however testing was 
unable to be accomplished due to the availability of the module therefore it is unknown if 
it is suitable for operation at 220 - 225 MHz.
Phase 5b: 5W VHF Power Amplifier Recycling
The MHW607-2 which is currently in the radio can be re-tuned to provide up to 5W in 
the 220 MHz band.
MHW607-2
Start by removing the power amplifier from the RF board and remove the lid. The lid is 
glued on pretty good and may be damaged during the removal process. Take care not 
to damage the components under the lid. I separate the front glue by cutting the plastic 
right above the leads.
There are 2 generations of modules. The late version changed to use a SAW filter after 
the final transistor. 
MHW607-2, Date code 9043
MHW607-2, Date code 9251
Some radios were observed to have the SHWJ1039 and the XHW1031, both of which 
appear to be similar to the late model MHW607-2
Remove the surface mount capacitor and coil in the upper left hand corner of the 
module. Wind a replacement inductor Using 3 turns of #26 (Green) on a 3/32” drill bit. 
Install replacement inductor in the position of the original.
Modified MHW607-2, Date code 9043
Cut a hole in the plastic cover to facilitate fine tuning of the inductor that was installed. 
The cover can also be left off, but take care not to touch the bonding wires on the 
module while handling.
Reinstall modified module on to the RF board. Reinstall RF board in chassis. Screw in 
BNC connector and tighten set screw before re-soldering to the RF board.
Modified RF Board 
Phase 6: Tuning
Test Cable 19B801406P62 is needed to service this radio while open, connecting the 
front and rear assemblies together.
A substitute cable was constructed with the connectors salvaged from a dead PCS and 
some 12 conductor ribbon cable. Standard 0.1” spacing 12 pin male and female SIP 
headers may also be used.
Opened PCS Radio 
Turn R119 fully clockwise. Set radio to a channel programmed for high power.
Adjust spacing of the coil installed at L107 for maximum RF output as seen on a watt 
meter. Use a fingernail or small screw driver to change the spacing of the windings.
If you recycled the RF power amplifier, Adjust spacing of the coil that was installed on it 
for maximum RF power seen on a watt meter. Be careful not to short circuit the power 
module with a metal tool as that usually results in destroying the final amplifier. 
Readjust L107 and the PA until no additional improvement is seen. If the radio makes 
over 5W, adjust R119 to bring power down to that level. Power modules converted were 
able to make between 2 and 5 watts of output power.
Switch radio to a channel programmed for low power and adjust R11 on the Power 
Control Board for 2W or the desired output setting.
Adjust R321 until 750 Hz of PL deviation is achieved. 
If constructed, Tune the image filter.  Set a signal generator for the current receive 
frequency minus 90 MHz. Trim the stub for lowest received signal, increase generator 
output as necessary.  
Some tweaking of the brass screws can be done to optimize the receiver’s sensitivity. 
Test radios were able to make -117 to -118dBm for 12dB SINAD and squelch threshold 
was around -120dBm to -122dBm. 
R608 sets the receiver’s squelch threshold. Refer to LBI-38623A PCS Personal Radios 
Service Section for the procedure to set this.
Remove test cable and reassemble the radio.
