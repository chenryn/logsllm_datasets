**Abstract:**
Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) have been used to support various business processes for over a decade. In e-commerce and web service applications, suppliers and customers establish binding agreements or contracts that specify Quality of Service (QoS) items such as products or services to be delivered, deadlines, product quality, and service costs. Effective QoS management is crucial for the success of organizations in e-commerce. This paper presents a predictive QoS model for workflows, which automatically computes the QoS based on atomic task attributes. We also describe the implementation of this QoS model in the METEOR workflow system, including the components that were modified or added, and how they interact to manage QoS.

**1. Introduction**
The evolution of global economies has necessitated that organizations become more competitive, efficient, flexible, and integrated at various levels, including information systems. Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) have played a significant role in streamlining and automating business processes, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Researchers have identified workflows as a key computing model for building web service applications and processes that connect and exchange information over the web (Chen et al., 2000; Leymann, 2001; Shegalov et al., 2001; Fensel and Bussler, 2002). However, the new advancements in e-services and web services have set higher requirements and challenges for workflow systems, particularly in the area of Quality of Service (QoS) management.

QoS has been a major concern in networking (Cruz, 1995; Georgiadis et al., 1996), real-time applications (Clark et al., 1992), and middleware (Zinky et al., 1997; Frolund and Koistinen, 1998; Hiltunen et al., 2000). However, few research efforts have focused on enhancing workflow systems to support QoS management. Most existing research in this area has concentrated on the time dimension, with limited and preliminary solutions (Eder et al., 1999).

For organizations, characterizing workflows based on QoS offers several advantages:
1. **QoS-based Design:** It allows organizations to design workflows according to QoS metrics, ensuring that e-commerce processes meet customer expectations.
2. **QoS-based Selection and Execution:** It enables the selection and execution of workflows based on their QoS, better fulfilling customer expectations.
3. **QoS Monitoring:** It facilitates the monitoring of workflows throughout their lifecycle to ensure compliance with initial QoS requirements.
4. **QoS-based Adaptation:** It supports the evaluation of alternative strategies when workflow adaptation is necessary, ensuring that QoS continues to meet initial requirements.

This paper is divided into two parts. The first part introduces a comprehensive QoS model for workflows and methods to compute and predict QoS. We investigate relevant QoS dimensions and define a model that goes beyond the time dimension. The second part describes the enhancements made to the METEOR workflow system to support QoS-constrained processes, including the implementation of the QoS model, algorithms for QoS computation, and methods for recording and managing QoS metrics.

**2. Workflows, Tasks, Web Services, and Web Processes**
Web services and e-services are expected to revolutionize internet-based business applications (Casati et al., 2001). As these technologies mature, organizations will increasingly incorporate web services into their business processes. While some web services may operate independently, it is natural to integrate them into workflows (Fensel and Bussler, 2002). The global economy demands advanced information systems that support multi-enterprise and web-scale processes (Bussler, 2003).

In our QoS model, tasks and web services are treated similarly. Both require a structure that includes task name, formal parameters, relevant data, and invoked applications. For example, in the METEOR workflow system, business tasks are wrapped with CORBA objects for transparent remote invocation. With recent technological developments, tasks can now be wrapped with web service interfaces, enhancing interoperability and integration.

The analogy between tasks and web services extends to workflows and web processes. Workflows automate business processes, passing documents, information, or tasks from one participant to another according to procedural rules. Web processes share these characteristics, allowing us to view them as workflows that manage web services instead of tasks (Cardoso and Sheth, 2003). Throughout this paper, the term "task" or "workflow task" refers to both traditional workflow tasks and web services.

**3. Scenario**
The Fungal Genome Resource laboratory (FGR) at the University of Georgia has adopted a workflow management system (METEOR) to support its laboratory processes (Hall et al., 2003). The adoption of a WfMS has enabled the capture of laboratory process logic in a workflow schema, storing and executing all available services under the supervision of the workflow system.

**3.1 Workflow Structure**
A METEOR workflow is composed of tasks, networks, and transitions. Tasks are represented by circles, networks (sub-workflows) by rounded rectangles, and transitions by arrows. Transitions express dependencies between tasks and are associated with enabling probabilities. Tasks with multiple outgoing transitions can be classified as and-split or xor-split, while tasks with multiple incoming transitions can be classified as and-join or xor-join.

**3.2 Workflow Description**
Genomic projects involve specialized personnel, equipment, and large data computations. The DNA Sequencing workflow, a simplified version of which is depicted in Figure 1, consists of eight main tasks: Setup, Prepare Sample, Prepare Clone and Sequence, Assembly, Get Sequences, Sequence Processing, and Process Report. Each task performs a specific function, and the workflow can be distributed across multiple research centers.

**3.3 Workflow Application Requirements**
The FGR laboratory executes the DNA Sequencing workflow regularly but currently lacks QoS management for important parameters such as delivery deadlines, reliability, and cost. The laboratory's requirements include:
- Delivering the final report within 31 weeks.
- Maintaining a 10% profit margin.
- Ensuring high reliability for urgent executions.

These requirements highlight the need for a QoS model that can specify and manage non-functional requirements such as time, cost, and reliability.

**4. Workflow Quality of Service**
Workflow QoS represents the quantitative and qualitative characteristics necessary to achieve initial requirements. Quantitative characteristics include measures such as execution time and cost, while qualitative characteristics specify expected services like security and fault tolerance. The QoS model presented here is designed for production workflows (McCready, 1992) and includes the following characteristics:

**4.1 Characteristics of the QoS Model**
- **Structure and Repetitiveness:** Production workflows are highly structured and repetitive.
- **Predictability and Complexity:** They are predictable and can handle complex processes.
- **Degree of Automation:** They support a high degree of automation.

This QoS model is essential for specifying and computing the QoS of workflows, and it forms the foundation of our work.

**Conclusion**
This paper has introduced a comprehensive QoS model for workflows and described its implementation in the METEOR workflow system. The model addresses the need for QoS management in e-commerce and web service applications, providing a framework for designing, selecting, monitoring, and adapting workflows based on QoS requirements. Future work will focus on further refining the model and extending its application to other workflow systems.
