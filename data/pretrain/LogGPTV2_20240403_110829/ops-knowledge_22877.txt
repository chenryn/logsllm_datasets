User: How to configure firewall rules at the network layer to protect the security of server ports?
Assistant: 1. Deny all inbound traffic: Allow only traffic from specified IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. 2. Enable source address verification: Only allow traffic to be sent from a legal IP address. 3. Restricted services: Only authenticated services are allowed to avoid some illegal attacks. 4. Attack prevention: Prevent attacks such as SYN flood and ICMP flood. 5. Enable VPN: Use a virtual private network to enable remote users or branch offices to connect to the internal network, providing access to internal applications and data while protecting data. 6. Allow multi-factor authentication: Adding multi-factor authentication requires higher user authentication and improves security. 7. Enable logging and anomaly detection: Log network layer activity to prevent intrusions and detect and respond to anomalous activity in a timely manner. 8. Regularly review rules: Regularly review network firewall rules and update and re-evaluate as necessary.
