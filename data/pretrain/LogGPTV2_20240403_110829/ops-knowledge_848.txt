Question: An Android device is being upgraded from version 1 (v1) to version 2 (v2) of its platform policy. As the security policy architect, you are tasked with ensuring that existing vendor policies continue to function correctly after the upgrade. Which of the following actions must be taken to appropriately handle the changes in type attributes and permissions?
"A": "Remove the `sysfs_A` type completely from the v2 platform policy as vendor policies do not rely on types removed in the platform upgrade.",
"B": "Maintain the definition of the `ZygoteConnection` object manager class and permissions in the v2 platform policy until the vendor version no longer uses it.",
"C": "Include a rule in the v2 platform policy that allows all domains that could have been created or extended by vendor policy to use new classes without obstruction.",
"D": "Automatically convert all vendor types to attributes in the v2 platform policy to ensure compatibility with the platform."
