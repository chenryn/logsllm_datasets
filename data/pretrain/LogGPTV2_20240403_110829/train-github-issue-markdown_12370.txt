Adding `search_after` option to the search api will allow better deep
pagination support for search request that don't use the scroll api.
The `search_after` option should be used to hold the last seen sort value for
each search request being executed with the same query (just like updating the
`from` option). Although in this case we don't keep open a consistent view of
all the shards, like we do with scroll search, it is a good alternative for
deep pagination for normal search requests that use `from` option. (actually
the only one that doesn't cause jvm heap issues without maintaining open
search contexts during subsequent scroll requests)
