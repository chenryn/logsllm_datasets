### Detailed Analysis

#### TLS-Based Censorship
- **Censorship Techniques:**
  - TLS-based censorship techniques, such as SNI-based blocking, can be ruled out.
  - General TCP and UDP port blocking on 443 can also be disregarded because other HTTPS and HTTP/3 requests during the same measurement round succeeded.
  - This leaves IP blocking as the most probable explanation.
  - The usage of HTTP/3 over QUIC cannot overcome this type of censorship because the interference happens at the underlying IP layer.
  - Since the censor does not exclusively apply IP endpoint blocking, hosts targeted by a different form of HTTPS censorship are still available over QUIC.

#### IP Blocking in Indian ISP
- **Network Observation:**
  - IP blocking was observed in the network of an Indian ISP located in AS55836.
  - For every TCP connection error associated with IP-blocking (TCP-hs-to and route-err), the corresponding QUIC measurement also fails.
  - This indicates that, like in AS45090, the applied IP-blocking affects QUIC in the same way as TCP but does not target the protocol directly.

#### UDP Endpoint Blocking in Iran
- **Observation:**
  - In Iran (AS62442), most HTTPS errors occur due to TLS-hs-toâ€™s, i.e., timeouts after the establishment of a TCP connection.
  - This is not a case of IP blocking but rather indicates that a TLS-blocking method, such as SNI-filtering, is active.
  - A third of the unsuccessful HTTPS attempts also fail if HTTP/3 is used instead, returning a timeout during the QUIC handshake (QUIC-hs-to).

#### SNI Spoofing Test
- **Test Hypothesis:**
  - To test the hypothesis that the SNI field is used for host identification for TLS-blocking in Iran, a subset of the host list was probed with the SNI field in the ClientHello set to example.org.
  - 83% of attempts to usually blocked TCP/TLS hosts succeed when applying the SNI spoof.
  - This behavior suggests that Iranian censors utilize SNI keyword filtering to block TCP/TLS connections.
  - Using the spoofed SNI does not affect the availability of the subset hosts when using HTTP/3.

#### Comparison with Other Networks
- **Comparison:**
  - In comparison to other probed networks, the percentage of pairs with a successful TCP/TLS attempt and a failed QUIC attempt is more pronounced, totaling 4.11% of all pairs.
  - The additional availability test in the post-processing step showed that the affected hosts are still available via QUIC from an uncensored AS, ruling out any server-side UDP fire walling.
  - Since the majority of website requests are still made with traditional HTTPS, it seems unreasonable that a censor would intentionally only block the lesser-used protocol, and we therefore assume that these hosts are unavailable as collateral damage caused by IP address filtering.

#### Middle Box Software
- **Conclusion:**
  - We believe that censors have deployed middle box software, which applies IP address filtering only to UDP traffic.
  - This conclusion is derived from the elimination of IP-based blocking and SNI blocking, and from the observed collateral damage in regards to censored QUIC connections.
  - Future work needs to determine if this filter specifically targets HTTP/3 traffic, i.e., UDP traffic on port 443, or UDP traffic to these IPs in general.

### Summary and Future Work

#### Current State of QUIC Censorship
- **Findings:**
  - Our measurements reveal that HTTP/3 requests are less frequently blocked than traditional HTTPS requests, or sometimes even not blocked at all.
  - This can be explained by the fact that QUIC is a relatively new protocol with a small share in overall internet traffic volume.
  - With its growing significance, efforts to better block QUIC will rise.
  - As observed with the outright blocking of Encrypted-SNI in China, it is possible that QUIC could be generally blocked by censors.

#### Identification Methodologies
- **Methodologies:**
  - Two identification methodologies were observed in the probed networks, aiming indirectly and directly at QUIC traffic.
  - The blocklisting of IP addresses is still an ongoing issue, as seen in the probed Chinese network and one of the probed networks in India.
  - While such IP blocking prevents HTTP/3 requests to blocklisted hosts, it also affects all other IP-based protocols.
  - In the two Iranian networks, we detected UDP endpoint blocking used against HTTP/3 connections.
  - The only observed interference method used to intercept QUIC connections is black holing to interrupt the handshake.

#### Dynamic Censorship
- **Dynamic Nature:**
  - Censorship methods dynamically change, and censors adapt to the emergence of new network technologies.
  - Measurements can only reflect the censorship situation at a certain point in time.
  - Currently, QUIC is not fully deployed internationally, so this work presents a fixed snapshot of an early stage of QUIC censorship.
  - The study should be repeated in the near future to highlight the development.

#### Future Directions
- **Future Work:**
  - Beyond the collected data, this work provides a measurement tool to long-term monitor HTTP/3 over QUIC blocking around the world.
  - Future measurements should not only monitor the use of established censorship methodologies applied to QUIC but also stay alert to detect new methods tailored to QUIC or TLS traffic and identify the use of statistical flow classification.
