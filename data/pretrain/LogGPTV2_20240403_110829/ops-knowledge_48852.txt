User: We use Ansible to manage hundreds of servers and now need to install a new package for them. Please describe how to achieve this task in Ansible.
Assistant: To install a new software package in Ansible, the following steps are required: 1. Confirm that the Ansible environment is ready and the ansible software package has been installed on the control node. 2. Write a Playbook, which should contain tasks, hosts, vars, roles and other elements. Among them, hosts is the part that defines the host list, including hundreds of servers we want to manage; vars is the part that defines variables, which is used to pass to tasks or templates; roles is the part that defines roles, which is used for different hosts Assign different operations for easy management. 3. In the tasks section of the Playbook, add the task of installing a new package, which should be implemented through a specific command, such as: - name: Install New Package yum: name: new_package state: present become: true become_user: root Among them, name is the name of the new software package, state: present indicates that the package needs to be installed, if the package has already been installed, it will not be installed again; become: true indicates that the task needs to be performed as root user. 4. Save and execute the Playbook, and wait for the task to complete. Ansible will automatically connect to all hosts and install new packages on all specified hosts. The above are the general steps for installing new software packages in Ansible, and the specific implementation can be adjusted according to actual needs.
