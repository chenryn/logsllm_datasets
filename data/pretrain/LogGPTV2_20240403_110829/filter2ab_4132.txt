### Title: How to Break PDF Encryption (BlackHat EU-19)

PDF is one of the most widely used document formats globally, and it supports document encryption to ensure confidentiality. In this presentation, we will analyze PDF encryption and introduce two novel techniques for breaking the confidentiality of encrypted documents.

**First Technique: Exploiting Partially Encrypted Documents**
We exploit a feature in PDF that allows for partially encrypted documents. By wrapping the encrypted part of the document within attacker-controlled content, we can exfiltrate the plaintext once the document is opened by a legitimate user.

**Second Technique: Manipulating Encrypted Content**
We also exploit a flaw in the PDF encryption specification to arbitrarily manipulate encrypted content. The only requirement for this attack is a single block of known plaintext, which is often available by design. Our attacks allow the recovery of the entire plaintext of encrypted documents using exfiltration channels based on standard-compliant PDF properties.

**Evaluation and Disclosure**
We evaluated our attacks on 27 widely used PDF viewers and found all of them to be vulnerable. We responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities to the vendors and provided support to help them mitigate the issues.
