Not sure if it is a bug or just general confusion. Tried only with 0.12.2, not
with master.
`this.forceUpdate();` crashes when a component is not mounted, which in itself
makes sense, I'd say. However, if you call `this.forceUpdate()` directly in
`componentWillMount`, it _doesn't_ crash, which suggests that it's OK to do
(just as `setState` is OK to call there).
This happens if you use a Flux-like architecture but don't use the
`componentDidMount`/`setState` combination (as Flux suggests) but
`componentWillMount`/`forceUpdate`.
The error that you get is "Invariant Violation: receiveComponent(...): Can
only update a mounted component."
