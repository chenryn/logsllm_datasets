pre-compiled contract for arithmetic operations in G1. We
could re-write our cryptographic primitives by swapping all
the operations in G1 and G2, at the cost of relying on the
SXDH assumption [44] (which is stronger than the standard
XDH assumption that we are currently using).
VII. COMPARISON WITH RELATED WORKS
We compare the Coconut cryptographic constructions and
system with related work in Table VII, along the dimensions
of key properties offered by Coconutâ€”blindness, unlinkability,
aggregability (i.e., whether multiple authorities are involved in
issuing the credential), threshold aggregation (i.e., whether a
credential can be aggregated using signatures issued by a sub-
set of authorities), and signature size (see Sections II and III).
15The Request and Issue procedures are only needed in the case of on-
chain issuance (see Section IV-A).
