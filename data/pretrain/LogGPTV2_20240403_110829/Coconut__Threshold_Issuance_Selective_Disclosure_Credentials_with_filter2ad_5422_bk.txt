### Pre-Compiled Contract for Arithmetic Operations in G1

We can re-implement our cryptographic primitives by substituting all operations in G1 with those in G2. However, this approach would require us to rely on the Symmetric eXternal Diffie-Hellman (SXDH) assumption [44], which is a stronger assumption than the standard eXternal Diffie-Hellman (XDH) assumption we currently use.

### VII. Comparison with Related Works

In Table VII, we compare the Coconut cryptographic constructions and system with related works, focusing on key properties such as blindness, unlinkability, aggregability (i.e., whether multiple authorities are involved in issuing the credential), threshold aggregation (i.e., whether a credential can be aggregated using signatures issued by a subset of authorities), and signature size (see Sections II and III).

**Note:**
- The Request and Issue procedures are only necessary for on-chain issuance (see Section IV-A).

This table provides a clear comparison of the key features offered by each scheme, allowing for a more informed evaluation of their respective strengths and weaknesses.
