of the changing malicious activity, since there is likely to be
a diversity of malicious activity when new threats emerge.
Summary.
Table 1(b) (Fig. 12) summarizes the differ-
ent preﬁxes for θ = 0.05%, 0.01%, categorized by the type
of change they have undergone. As in Section 4.2, the
preﬁxes discovered increases sharply when θ is increased.
However, note that in this experiment, there are very signif-
icant numbers of ∆-good preﬁxes discovered as well – over
56% of all the preﬁxes discovered are ∆-good, unlike the
spam data. This is primarily because the active IP address
space changes very little, while bot IP addresses appear in
the feed for much shorter durations (e.g., this may be as bots
get cleaned, or bot signatures get outdated). A former bot
IP would then generate mostly legitimate trafﬁc (its mali-
cious trafﬁc would drop, but its legitimate activity remains
the same, and so it would get labelled as legitimate), and the
corresponding IP regions thus become ∆-good.
Case Study 3: New Botnet Activity.
Our case study
illustrates the value of discovering ∆-bad preﬁxes internal
to a large ISP’s preﬁx blocks. Figure 15(c) shows the time-
series of the ∆-change preﬁxes discovered over two months
of our data set. The highlighted days (A and B) mark two
sharp increases in the number of ∆-change preﬁxes discov-
ered. These correspond to days with dramatic increases in
the number of new bot IPs seen in the data feed – 22.1 &
28.6 thousand at the two days marked as A and 36.8 thou-
sand at B Further analysis showed that on days marked A,
nearly all of of these new bot IPs are from the DNSChanger
botnet [8], and are responsible for 19 & 31 ∆-bad pre-
ﬁxes. On day B, these new bot IPs are from Sality [25]
and Conﬁcker [6], and 66 ∆-bad preﬁxes correspond to the
new IPs from Sality and Conﬁcker. By contrast, network-
aware clusters were only able to discover 5-12 preﬁx blocks
as ∆-bad during these events. These ∆-bad preﬁxes come
from smaller regional ISPs, the tier-1 ISP’s dial-up and DSL
blocks; most of these preﬁxes had little to botnet activity
(as identiﬁed by the vendor) earlier. Thus, in these two in-
stances, ∆-Change effectively reduces the workload for op-

4.4 Structural Analysis of IP Dynamics
Our earlier results demonstrate that there is constant
change in the Internet’s malicious activity. We now explore
the structure underlying these changes with the ∆-Motion
algorithm, focusing our analysis on spam dataset due to
space. We use a snapshot of the change-IPtree W generated
by ∆-Motion, 60 days into the dataset; W ’s high predictive
accuracy indicates it can distinguish frequently-changing
regions well, as shown by the ROC curve in Fig. 16. We
use W to classify every IP in our data set as ”change” or
”non-change”, and then aggregate the IPs by country and
owning company. We deﬁne freq-ratio to be the fraction of
the total IPs of that entity that are marked as change IPs,
and analyze the freq-ratio of different aggregations.
Table 3 (Fig. 17) shows a breakdown for the origin of the
frequently changing IPs. Together, these countries account
for 90% of the data seen at our mail servers. We note that
countries like China, Korea, Russia [23], which are known
to harbor lot of spammers actually change very infrequently,
while countries like US and Canada change 3-4 times more
frequently. This makes sense, as countries where ISPs ag-
gressively ﬁght spammer infestations are likely to experi-
ence a more frequent change in malicious activity. Table
4 shows a breakdown by ISP type. Once again, hosting
providers have a substantially higher ratio than the other cat-

Table 4: ISP type
Figure 17. Analyzing the IPtree learnt by ∆-Motion:
the tables show frequently changing regions
egories, consistent with our results in Section 4.2, since it is
much easier to spam out of a hosting provider. We see both
large and small ISPs seem to have roughly the same fre-
quency of change, and that businesses (which constitute the
most of the ”other” category) have a tiny ratio, as expected.
The set of hosting providers discovered by ∆-Motion
(which are the same as those that ∆-Change identiﬁes re-
peatedly as ∆-bad preﬁxes) are of particular interest to mail
operators. As discussed in Section 4.2, hosting providers
are especially vulnerable to changes because they see a
wide variety of users, who sometimes take any opportu-
nity to spam. However, because these providers also have
many legitimate clients, they cannot be entirely blacklisted,
and therefore need to be closely monitored so that they do
not cause a signiﬁcant performance impact. Indeed, this is
likely true of all new hosting providers as they appear on
the market, and it is this kind of structural insight about ma-
licious activity that ∆-Motion could discover, which may
help operators prioritize their resources.
5 Related Work
Spam.
There has recently been a lot of interest in de-
signing non-content based approaches to spam-ﬁltering. Of
these, most closely related to our work are the IP-based
spam ﬁltering approaches. These have included studies on
individual IP addresses, AS numbers and /24 preﬁxes [23],
BGP preﬁxes [27, 30], preﬁxes with dynamic IP assign-
ment [31], highly predictive blacklists [33], using a com-
bination of DNS clusters and BGP preﬁxes [22], and using
well-deﬁned properties of spammers to discover IP address
ranges used by spam gangs [9]. Our work differs from all
of these as we are concerned with automatically discovering
the preﬁxes that change their malicious behavior, using only
a stream of IP addresses labelled spammer or legitimate;
we do not use a priori ﬁxed clusters that originating from
network-based properties. There have also been behavior-
based spam ﬁltering approaches [13, 24], and analysis and
identiﬁcation of spam campaigns [2,18] and spamming bot-
nets [15, 32]; these take a very different angle, comple-
mentary to ours, for analyzing shifting malicious activity.
Lastly, there have been a number of studies showing the
relative inaccuracy of DNS-based blacklists [16, 26] Again,
our results are complementary to (and consistent with) all
these analyses, as we show that even with a near-optimal
partitioning of the IP address space, there are still a large
number of changes in spamming behavior.
Other Related Work.
Xie et al [31] consider the prob-
lem of discovering IP addresses that are dynamically as-
signed. Our problem is different from this work, as we are
interested in dynamic of malicious activity, not of IP ad-
dress assignment. Soldo et al. [28] study the problem of
ﬁltering malicious activity but their algorithms only oper-
ate on ofﬂine data, not streaming data. Finally, note also
that our problem differs from work on identifying hierar-
chical heavy-hitters [7, 10, 34], and discovering signiﬁcant
changes in the multi-dimensional aggregates [1, 4, 14, 17]:
these problems are concerned with volumetric changes on a
hierarchy, not on changes in classiﬁcation of decision tree.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we formulated and addressed the problem
of discovering changes in malicious activity across the In-
ternet. Our evaluations using a large corpus of mail data and
botnet activity indicate that our algorithms are fast, can keep
up with Internet scale trafﬁc data, and can extract changes
in sources of spam activity substantially better (a factor of
2.5) than approaches based on using predetermined levels
of aggregation such as BGP-based network-aware clusters.
Using our algorithms, we ﬁnd that some regions of the In-
ternet are prone to much faster changes than others, such as
a set of hosting providers that are of particular interest to
mail operators.
