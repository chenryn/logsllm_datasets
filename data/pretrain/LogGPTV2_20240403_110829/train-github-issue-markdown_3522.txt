When attempting to create an Isolate in `--debug` mode, the Dart VM fails to fetch the required Dart source code for the new Isolate. This error occurs when tapping the `Start` button in the `services/isolate.dart` example. The issue was previously reported as #5814 and was partially resolved for `--release` mode. However, it still persists in the default `--debug` mode, albeit for different reasons.

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

```bash
flutter/examples/layers$ flutter run -t services/isolate.dart
```

The output of the command is as follows:
