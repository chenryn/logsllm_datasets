User: This issue doesn't pertain to any code exactly.  I think my installation (python 3.3.5) became corrupted somehow.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, as well as repairing, but nothing has worked.  It's been a while since I last ran any python code or did anything involving python, really, so I can't say I accidentally messed up my own install.  The only thing I can think of which might be an issue is installation and updates of Blender to 2.7.
Assistant: It turns out uninstalling Blender, uninstalling Python, reinstalling Python and then reinstalling Blender(optional) did the trick.  Blender 2.70 has some Python 3.4 libraries bundled with it on installation, but I'm guessing for some reason, having an older version of Python already installed caused conflicts/dependency issues/wh.  I'd love to know the details on why, but for now I'm just glad I can run python scripts again.
