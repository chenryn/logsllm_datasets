Assistant: At 16:14:22, the PhoneStatusBar setSystemUiVisibility and setLightsOn functions were called multiple times. At 16:14:23, the DisplayPowerController set the HBM brightnessIn and brightnessOut to 38 and began animating the brightness. At 16:14:24, the ActivityManager attempted to getTasks but was limited due to lack of permission. At 16:14:25, the ActivityManager attempted to getRunningAppProcesses but was limited due to lack of permission. At 16:14:25, the AudioManager checked if music was active. At 16:14:27, the AlarmManager sent an alarm.
