isting primary channels according to their utility values. 
There  are  two  cases  in  which  the  primary  chan- 
nels can increase their reservation of resources: (1) when a 
DR-connection is released/ terminated, and ( 2 )  when a new 
“indirectly-chained” DR-connection arrives.  When a DR- 
connection has completed its service, the resources reserved 
for that  connection are released, and the primary  channels 
that have shared links with this terminating connection can 
now reserve more resources. In the second case, two chan- 
nels  that  do not  share  any  link  are  said  to  be  indirectly- 
chained when there is a third channel that traverses at least 
one link of both channels’ paths. 
3.2  The Analysis Model 
To  analyze  the  performance  of  DR-connections  with 
elastic  QoS,  one  can  consider  two  plausible  approaches. 
The first approach is to analyze the network behavior, such 
as the amount of message traffic increased and the number 
of DR-connections that can be accommodated.  This anal- 
ysis  approach reflects a network-centric  view.  The second 
approach is to analyze the channel behavior, such as the av- 
erage bandwidth reserved. This approach reflects a channel- 
centric view.  In this paper, we take the second approach or 
the channel-centric view, since our main concern lies in the 
analysis of channel behavior. 
The performance metric considered here  is the average 
bandwidth reserved for each primary channeL4 The average 
bandwidth reserved is important in predicting the behavior 
of a primary channel before actually reserving resources for 
the primary channel. 
Prior to  the  analysis,  one must  have  knowledge of  the 
network behavior, most  of  which  was described in  the pre- 
vious subsection. One thing which  was not discussed there 
is the amount of change in the bandwidth reserved. If chan- 
nels are allowed  to have any bandwidth  between  the mini- 
mum and the maximum specified in the elastic QoS require- 
ment, the resource management would become unmanage- 
ably  complex.  A  slight change  in  the  available  resources 
for a channel will trigger re-adjustment of the resources re- 
served for the channel, and this could occur very frequently, 
thus overloading the network.  In practice, it is desirable to 
change resource reservation only when there are noticeable 
changes in the  available  resources.  Also,  it  would  be bet- 
ter  to change resource reservation  in  multiples of the min- 
imum  amount of  resources, known  as  the  increnzent size. 
This way,  the  network can  handle  the  available  resources 
easily and efficiently.  We assume that the increment size is 
given and the interval between  the minimum and the maxi- 
mum resources is an integral multiple of the increment size. 
We use the following notationkymbols in describing the 
analysis model. 
h  :  DR-connection  request  arrival  rate.  We  consider 
that the request inter-arrival time is exponentially dis- 
tributed with rate h. 
p  : DR-connection termination  rate.  We also consider that 
the  interval  between  two  successive  DR-connection 
terminations is exponentially distributed  with rate p. 
y : Link failure  rate.  The inter-arrival  time  of  failures is 
exponentially distributed  with rate y. 
Bm;,t :  The minimum bandwidth that can be  reserved  for 
a DR-connection.  If the network  cannot even reserve 
this minimum amount of bandwidth, the request  is re- 
jected.

DR-connection.

A;,, :  The transition  probability  from state Si to state S,;,

resents the  probability  that a channel has at least one link 
shared with  the  newly-arrived  channel.  Ai,,j represents the 
probability  that there is a transition  from Si to S, and h rep- 
resents the arrival rate of new primary channels. 
The resources released by  the existing channels, due to 
the  arrival  of  a  new  channel  or  the  activation  of  backup 
channels, remain un-allocated at a link on which the newly- 
arrived channel does not pass through. These resources are 
considered extra resources and are allocated to the existing 
channels on that link, which do not have any link overlap- 
ping with  the newly-arrived  channel.  These existing chan- 
nels are “indirectly-chained” channels.  The transition rate 
is Ps x Bi,, x h. Ps represents the probability  that a channel 
is indirectly chained with the new channel.  Note that there 
are only upward transitions, i.e., from S; to Sj where i < j .  
Another case in which an existing channel can increase 
resource reservation  is the termination of an existing chan- 
nel.  Only those channels that share at least one link with 
the terminating channel can enjoy this benefit.  The transi- 
tion rate corresponding to this case is Pf x 7;.,j  x ,u where p 
represents the channel termination rate. 
The last case is the occurrence of  a fault.  Fault occur- 
rence to  a  link  triggers activation  of  the backup channels 
running through the failed link. The activated backup chan- 
nels reclaim  their resources which were given as extra re- 
sources to other co-existing primary channels to temporar- 
ily enhance their QoS. This will cause the primary channels 
to return their extra resources. If there still remain extra re- 
sources after the activation of backup channels, they will be 
re-distributed  to the existing primary channels. This transi- 
tion  rate is Pf  x Ai,, x y where y represents the link failure 
rate. 
3.3  On obtaining parameters 
In  the  previous  subsection,  we  presented  a  Markov 
model to analyze DR-connections with elastic QoS. So far, 
we described all the parameters associated with state transi- 
tions.  Next, we discuss how to determine these parameters. 
The  link  failure  rate  is  a  network-dependent  parame- 
ter  and  can  be  obtained  from  network  service providers. 
Parameters such as DR-connection arrival and termination 
rates  are application-dependent and can  be  obtained from 
application service providers. Parameters such as the prob- 
abilities  of  overlapping  with  the  new  channel  and  being 
indirectly-chained are network-dependent parameters, and 
are also partly  related  to  applications.  When  the  underly- 
ing network is a regular-topology network, these probabili- 
ties depend solely on the network topology and the average 
number of hops of channels. However, since the network we 
consider is a public network such as the Internet, it is almost 
impossible to parameterize these probabilities analytically. 
Moreover, since a channel may not take a shortest route due 
to the insufficient amount of available resources, the analy- 
sis based on network topology will differ in a real situation. 
A  better approach would be to obtain them from real net- 
works with running applications. This is possible and sim- 
ple for network service providers to achieve by  measuring 
and analyzing network activities.  In this paper, we obtained

these  parameters  through  detailed  simulations.  Likewise, 
the probabilities of  transitioning from one state to another 
when  a  new  DR-connection request arrives or an  existing 
connection terminates, are obtained through simulations. 
4  Numerical Results and Discussion 
This section presents and discusses our evaluation results 
of  the  proposed  Markov model.  The  performance metric 
used  is the  average bandwidth  reserved  for primary  chan- 
nels. 
10Mbps. Although the bandwidth  of each link in the Inter- 
net  is different, we assume that the bandwidth  is the same 
for all  links in a given  network.  This kind  of  environment 
can be easily  found in intranets, and it  is not difficult to re- 
lax  the  assumption.  The minimum bandwidth  required  by 
a DR-connection is  1 OOKbps and the maximum bandwidth 
required  is SOOKbps. For example, a video service requires 
at  least  1 OOKbps for recognizable continuous images and 
SOOKbps for a high-quality  image.  The size of bandwidth 
increment  or decrement is SOKbps or  100Kbps. The only 
difference between  the  two  increment sizes  is  the  number 
of states in the Markov chains. 
The probabilities P,,  Py, Ai,;, B;,,, and  T,; are obtained 
using simulations. The simulation  environments are as fol- 
lows.  A  random  network  is  generated  using  the  GT In- 
ternetworking  Topology  Models  (GT-ITM) package  [ 141. 
Thc gencrated network  is a random or transit-stub  network 
with  100 nodes [ 141. The parameters used  to generate net- 
works  are  described  in  each  figure  showing the  results  if 
necessary.  We  measured  the  probabilities  f f  and  Ps  af- 
ter setting  up  a certain  number of  DR-connections.  Also, 
we  generated  and  terminated  randomly  a  certain  number 
of  DR-connections while  maintaining the  number of  DR- 
connections in  the  network  close to  the  initial  number of 
DR-connections to measure the transition probabilities A,,,;, 
B;,, and  E,.,.  The  Markov  models  are  solved  using  the 
SHARPE package [ 151. 
Figure  2  shows  the  average  bandwidth  of  a  DR- 
connection as the number of DR-connections in the network 
increases. The network is generated using the Waxman dis- 
tribution  [ 161 with  parameters a = 0.33  and p = 0 where 
a and 
are  the  parameters of  Waxman  distribution.  The 
number of  nodes in  the  generated network  is  100 and the 
number of edges is 354. The average degree of connection 
is 3.48  and average diameter is  8.  The DR-connection ar- 
rival rate (also termination  rate) is given 0.001 and the link 
failure rate is given 0 to see only the effect of the new DR- 
connection arrival and termination. The utilities of all con-
