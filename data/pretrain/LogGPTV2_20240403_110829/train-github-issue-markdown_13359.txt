**Test file (self-contained)**
    for (const page of context.pages())
      await page.close();
    await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });
    await context.close();
**Steps**
  * [Run the test]
**Expected**
[Describe expected behavior]  
Based on previous answers.I closes all pages, all network request should be

**Actual**
[Describe actual behavior]  
But the actual situation is not like this  
I still cannot collect requests that are still pending when the page is closed
in the trace  
Perhaps this is a bug
