User: I'm running Ubuntu to compile a set of code which requires python 2.4.
How can I setup a terminal launcher so that when I open that launcher all python related commands will use python 2.4 instead of the python 2.6 that is defaulted in Ubuntu?
Assistant: Set a bash alias in that shell session: alias python=python2.4 (assuming python2.4 is in your $PATH of course).  This way you won't have to remember to explicitly type the 2.4 a zillion times in that terminal -- which is what bash aliases are for!-)
