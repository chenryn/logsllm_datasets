I'm using version 0.129.0 on a new MacBook Pro, with OSX 10.9.5
Whenever I perform a "Find in Project" command: ⌘⇧F  
a new tab is opened titled "Project FindResults".  
This tab contains the matches, arranged per file.
I've noticed two different and inconsistent behaviors:
  * If I start collapsing match sets by file (click the v to change it to >),  
the files collapse properly, but any files that were not already displayed in
the panel  
will not show up as I continue to collapse match sets by file.  
This leads to not being able to see all of the matches.
  * If, instead, I scroll to the bottom first,  
I can see all of the matches. Then the collapsing works as expected.  
And regardless of the order in which I collapse match sets by file,  
I can find all of the matches.
