I am currently using version 0.129.0 on a new MacBook Pro running macOS 10.9.5. When I execute the "Find in Project" command (⌘⇧F), a new tab titled "Project Find Results" is opened. This tab displays the search matches, organized by file.

I have observed two different and inconsistent behaviors with this feature:

1. **Collapsing Match Sets Without Scrolling:**
   - If I start collapsing match sets by file (by clicking the 'v' to change it to '>'), the files that are already visible in the panel collapse as expected.
   - However, any files that were not initially displayed in the panel do not appear as I continue to collapse other match sets. This results in some matches being hidden and thus not viewable.

2. **Collapsing Match Sets After Scrolling:**
   - If I first scroll to the bottom of the "Project Find Results" tab, all matches are loaded and become visible.
   - In this case, the collapsing functionality works as expected, and I can see all the matches regardless of the order in which I collapse the match sets.

This inconsistency makes it difficult to ensure that all search results are visible without first scrolling to the bottom of the results.
