to  share  verbally  their  concerns  and  fears  about  security  for 
implantable  cardiac  devices.  Volunteer  participants  grouped  the 
concerns into clusters based on similarity.  
Evaluation of Security and Access Control System Concepts. 
To understand participants’ views on what properties to advocate 
for and which to avoid in the development of security and access 
control  solutions  for  implantable  cardiac  devices,  a  researcher 
introduced participants to six potential security and access control 
systems,  one  at  a  time.  The  researcher  indicated  that  these  were 
early,  representative  systems  designed  to  elicit  feedback.  The 
system concepts are described in Section 4.3 below. Directly after 
each  system  presentation,  participants  completed  a  paper  and 
pencil  worksheet  in  which  they  recorded  their  responses  to  the 
following questions: From your perspective as a professional who

deals  with  implantable  cardiac  devices,  what  do  you  like  about 
this concept? What do you dislike about this concept? Why?  
Once participants had been introduced to all six system concepts, 
participants completed a worksheet with the following questions: 
(1)  Would  you  say  that  you  like  any  of  the  concepts,  and  if  so, 
which  ones?;  (2)  Would  you  say  that  you  dislike  any  of  the 
concepts, and if so, which ones?; (3) If you were to choose one or 
more of these concepts to recommend for use in the future, which 
concept  or  concepts  would  you  choose?  Why?;  and  (4)  If  you 
were  to  choose  one  or  more  of  these  concepts  to  recommend

on hand if they needed to refresh their memories. 
Open-ended Discussion. Finally, to ensure that participants had 
ample  opportunity  to  surface  any  major  issues  that  might  have 
been  missed,  participants  engaged  in  an  open-ended  discussion 
around security and access control for implantable cardiac devices 
in which they could respond to and debate each other’s ideas. To 
initiate the discussion, a research team member used the following 
prompt: What are the challenges in this space? 
Due  to  space  constraints,  we  do  not  present  the  results  of  the 
critiques  section  or  the  open-ended  discussion.  While  this  data 
contained some interesting information, by and large the content 
and issues overlapped with that from the other workshop sections. 
4.3  Security System Concepts 
As noted above, participants were asked to evaluate six security 
and  access  control  system  concepts  (see  Figure  1).  A  researcher 
presented  the  systems  to  participants  using  verbal  explanations 
and  slides.  These  systems  are  not  complete  or  perfect  from  a 
security  (access  control:  false  positive),  safety  (access  control: 
false  negative),  or  usability  standpoint.  We  presented  these 
systems for feedback because: (a) they are representative of some 
of  the  security  solutions  that  have  been  previously  proposed  by 
the  security  research  community;  (b)  they  represent  a  variety  of 
relevant  system  properties;  and  (c)  the  discussion  of  a  specific 
system  can  serve  to  ground  an  otherwise  abstract  discussion. 
Table  2  provides  a  summary  of  some  of  the  systems’  relevant 
properties. The six security concepts are as follows: 
A.  Medical  Alert  Bracelet  with  Password.  A  medical  alert 
bracelet worn by the patient with a password engraved on the 
inside. The password is required to read information off of or 
to

B.  Centralized  Database.  A  centralized  database  system  that 
medical  centers  can  access  to  obtain  a  temporary  password 
that can then be used to access the implanted cardiac device. 
C.  UV-Visible  Tattoo  of  a  Password.  The  patient  is  tattooed 
with  a  scannable  representation  of  a  password  (e.g.,  2D 
barcode) using UV-visible ink that is only visible under a UV 
(black light) light source.  
D.  Fail-Open/Safety  Wristband.  The  patient  wears  a  battery-
powered  system  that,  when  present,  prevents  unauthorized 
implanted 
programmers  from  communicating  with 
cardiac  device.  When 
the 
implanted  device  accepts  communications 
from  all 
programmers.  Additionally,  the  wristband:  sounds  an  alarm 
when  the  patient  is  approaching  a  strong  magnet  source  (a 
potentially serious risk to cardiac device patients); and dials

E.  Proximity-Based  Equipment.  Equipment 
that  medical 
professionals can hold in contact with the patient’s body in 
order to communicate with the implantable cardiac device. 
F.  Criticality-Aware Fail-Open IMD. An implantable cardiac 
device that uses available information—such as the patient’s 
cardiac  rhythm,  movements,  and  location—to  determine 
whether  or  not  the  patient  is  likely  experiencing  a  medical 
emergency.  If  the  system  detects  a  likely  emergency,  it 
changes  the  security  settings  to  allow  access  from  any 
programmer.  The  system  does  not  notify  anyone  about  the 
medical emergency and does not change cardiac therapies.

4.4  Coding and Reliability 
coded 
Participants’  written 
systematically  using 
the  following  process:  one  researcher 
developed a coding scheme using all of the data; once completed, 
that researcher used the finalized coding scheme to systematically 
recode the entire data set. A second coder—not affiliated with the 
research  team  or  the  study—was  trained  in  the  coding  scheme 
using data from 4 participants, and then independently performed 
reliability  coding  of  the  data  for  the  remaining  20  participants. 
This process resulted in an overall kappa of 0.745; Fleiss rates any 
value of kappa over 0.75 as excellent agreement and between 0.40 
and  0.75  as  intermediate  to  good  agreement  [11],  while  Landis 
and  Koch  rate  a  kappa  of  0.81  to  1.00  as  “almost  perfect”  and 
between 0.61 and 0.80 as “substantial” agreement [21].  
The metaphor data set was smaller and, thus, more appropriately 
coded by consensus. We used the following process: (1) first, two 
researchers independently read through all of the data to generate 
an  initial  set  of  coding  categories  and  assign  responses  to 
categories;  (2)  next,  using  consensus,  researchers  iteratively 
synthesized  categories  and  arrived  at  agreement;  and  (3)  both 
researchers made another independent pass through all of the data 
and any lingering disagreements were resolved. 
Justifications in the security system concept evaluation data were 
identified from inspection of the qualitative data and are presented 
via participant quotes. 
5.  RESULTS 
Given  the  relatively  small  number  of  participants  in  each 
workshop,  there  was  no  way  to  draw  meaningful  comparisons 
among  the  workshops’  participant  demographics  (e.g.,  location, 
gender,  age,  professional  role).  We  combined  the  data  from  all 
three workshops into one data set.

Initial  Perspectives 
largely 
(that 
is, 
uninfluenced  by  our  subsequent  workshop  activities)  view  into 
what  participants  consider  important  about  implantable  cardiac 
devices and their usage to treat patients. Since our primary interest 
was  to  understand  broadly  the  pre-existing  issues  important  to 
medical providers, we examined providers’ responses to the set of 
five questions as a whole (rather than by individual question). 
Thirteen  categories  of  issues  emerged  from  the  analysis  of 
participant responses as follows (in alphabetic order): (1) Access 
&  Sharing;  (2)  Compatibility;  (3)  Correct  Usage;  (4)  Device 
Battery  Life;  (5)  Device  Compactness  /  Inertness;  (6)  Device 
Ecosystem; (7) Device Functionality; (8) Patient / Patient Health; 
(9) Programming; (10) Quality of Data; (11) Remote Monitoring; 
(12) Security & Privacy; and (13) Surgery & Healing. Over three-
quarters  of  the  participants  expressed  issues  related  to  Device 
Functionality (79%) and Patient/Patient Health (75%); more than 
half  mentioned  Surgery  &  Healing  (58%).  The  next  most 
represented categories were mentioned by roughly a quarter of the 
participants (ranging from 25-29%). That said, given the sample 
size and exploratory nature of this study, we believe it would be 
prudent to consider all 13 categories of issues when designing a 
security system for implantable cardiac devices.  
This list of issues provides a window into the values and priorities 
of  medical  providers  dealing  with  implantable  cardiac  devices. 
Security  and  human-computer  interaction  researchers  may  not 
have sufficient domain knowledge to make direct judgments as to 
how a system design might interact with these aspects of medical 
care;  these  categories,  and  other  data  like  them,  may  serve  as  a 
meaningful starting point for dialog with domain experts. 
5.2  Metaphors 
Metaphors  often  underlay  people’s  mental  models  of 
technological  systems,  which  can  affect  the  ways  in  which  they 
interact  with 
those  systems.  The  metaphors  supplied  by 
participants provide some indication as to how they conceptualize 
implantable  cardiac  devices  and  security  systems  for  those 
devices.  In  addition,  using  metaphor  generation  as  an  opening 
activity was intended to help break the ice; metaphor generation is 
rapid and appropriate for ideas that might otherwise be considered 
offbeat or silly. 
As a group, participants generated a total of 81 metaphors: 42 for 
the  implantable  cardiac  devices  and  39  for  security  and  access 
control for those devices. The following 11 categories—given in 
alphabetic  order—emerged  from  clustering 
together  similar 
metaphors:  (1)  Agency;  (2)  Bio-medical;  (3)  Business;  (4) 
Emotion; (5) Information; (6) Maintenance; (7) Personal Identity; 
(8)  Privacy;  (9)  Risk;  (10)  Security;  and  (11)  Technology. 
Participants  understood  implantable  cardiac  devices  in  a  broad 
variety of ways, including bio-medical terms, both positive (e.g., 
“life  savers”)  and  negative  (“site  of  infection”);  and  emotional 
terms,  though  always  negatively  (e.g.,  “anxiety  producing,” 
“source  of  hassle”).  Participants  described  the  device’s  security 
systems in terms of: security, both secure (e.g., “secure site on the 
Internet”) and insecure (e.g., “bank with an unlocked vault”); risk 
(e.g., “life threatening”); and information,(e.g., “complete control 
of information,” “black box on a plane”).  
The  diversity  of  metaphors  as  well  the  potential  for  any  given 
metaphor  type  to  convey  both  positive  and  negative  dimensions 
points  to  the  need  for  security  researchers  to  attend  carefully  to 
how stakeholders conceptualize—in lay terms—security for such 
devices,  and  how  they  use  those  conceptualizations  to  generate 
positive or negative perspectives on the security system. 
5.3  Security System Concepts 
To understand participants’ feedback on the six specific security 
system concepts presented, we adapted a values dams and flows 
approach. We looked at which systems participants found strongly 
acceptable (flows)—that is, the systems which many participants 
liked  and  very  few  participants  disliked—and  which  systems 
participants  found  less  acceptable  (dams)—that  is,  the  systems 
which few participants liked and many participants disliked. This 
analysis helps inform the interpretation of the following section, 
in which we present some of the reasons that providers expressed 
for liking or disliking specific systems. 
Evaluations.  Table  3  provides  an  overview  of  the  results  from 
participants’  evaluations  of 
the  security  system  concepts 
presented. The fail-open/safety wristband (shown in Table 3 with 
green  cells)  was  the  best  received  in  all  categories:  the  largest 
percentage of providers liked it (58%) and would recommend its 
use  (46%),  and  the  smallest  percentage  of  providers  disliked  it 
(17%)  and  would  recommend  against  its  use  (13%).  The  UV-
visible tattoo of a password (shown in Table 3 with the row of red 
cells)  was  the  least  satisfactory  in  all  categories:  only  17%  of 
providers liked it; 54% disliked it; 50% recommended against its 
use; and only 13% recommended its use. Two other systems reach
