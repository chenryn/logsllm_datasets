This may be trivial problem, but there seems to be inconsistency between
variance and covariance
import numpy as np  
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  
np.var(x)
produces 4.0, but then
np.cov(x,x)
produces
array([[4.66666667, 4.66666667],  
[4.66666667, 4.66666667]])
Of course, mathematically var(x) = cov(x,x). The difference here is clearly
because in np.var the sum seems to be divided by n while in np.cov the sum
seems to be divided by n - 1. For a naive user without paying attention to the
detail, this inconsistency may cause some problem.
