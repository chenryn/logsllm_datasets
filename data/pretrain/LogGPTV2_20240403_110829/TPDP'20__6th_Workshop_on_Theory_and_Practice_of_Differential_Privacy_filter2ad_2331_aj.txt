2. By deﬁnition of VC dimension, there is a even-sized set S of at least min{(VC(Q) − 1, 2n}
columns for which the rows of QS contain all 2k binary strings of length k. The partial
discrepancy of this set of vectors is thus greater than k/20.
Combining Proposition 5.11 with Theorem 5.8, we obtain lower bounds on the error α needed
by diﬀerentially private mechanisms in terms of least singular values of submatrices QT
S and in
terms of the VC dimension VC(Q). The lower bound on error in terms of least singular values is
due to Kasiviswanathan et al. [65], and the lower bound on error in terms of VC dimension is due to
Blum et al. [14]. An advantage of using the singular-value relaxation in place of partial discrepancy

is that it allows for a polynomial-time reconstruction attack, similarly to the discussion after the
proof of Theorem 5.6. The attack based on VC dimension is based on brute-force enumeration,
just like Theorem 5.2, but the search space is of size 2VC(Q) ≤ |Q|.
Recall that the largest possible discrepancy among k × s matrices (with k ≥ s) is achieved (up
to constant factors) by a random matrix, with the bound stated in Lemma 5.7. To apply this for
lower bounds on diﬀerentially private release of counting queries, we can take Q to be a family of
k random counting queries over a data universe X, and S ⊆ X to be an arbitrary subset of size
s = min{|Q|,|X|, n}. Then QS is a random matrix and combining Lemma 5.7 and Theorem 5.8, we
obtain:
Theorem 5.12 (largest possible discrepancy lower bound). For every data universe X and n, k ∈ N,
there is a family of k counting queries Q over X such that if M : Xn → RQ is a (1, .1)-diﬀerentially
private mechanism that with high probability answers every query in Q with error at most α, we
have:

Let’s compare this with the upper bounds that we have for (ε, δ)-diﬀerential privacy given
by Theorems 2.7, 2.9, and 4.3. For every family of counting queries, choosing the best of these
algorithms will give an error bound of

the possibility of having vanishingly small error whenever |Q| = exp( ˜Ω(n)), independent of the size
of the data universe). In Section 5.3, we will see diﬀerent lower-bound techniques that can yield

Let us now turn to the concrete families of counting queries from Section 1.3:
• Point functions (Qpt): Here PDisc(QS) = 1 for every S (since all the sets are of size 1), so
we do not obtain any interesting lower bound.
• Threshold functions (Qthr): Here also PDisc(QS) = 1 for every S, because if we write
S = {s1  n, the lower bound is no better
than Ω((cid:112)(log d)/n), which leaves quite a large gap from the upper bound, which remains
O((cid:112)d · log(1/δ) log log d/ε). In particular, the upper bound is useless when d = ω(n2), but

t · (cid:98)log(d/t)(cid:99), so we have an error lower bound of Ω(min{t log(d/t)/n, 1}). For t = O(1),

• All conjunctions on {0, 1}d (Qconj(d)): The VC dimension of this class is at least d, yielding
an error lower bound of Ω(min{d/n, 1}). Matouˇsek et al. [76] showed that the hereditary
