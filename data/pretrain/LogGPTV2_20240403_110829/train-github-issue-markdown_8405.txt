    let i: u8 = -1
Replacing -1 by 256 gives the following warning:
     literal out of range for its type
This could also apply to the code above. Unfortunately even an explicit cast
to u8 doesn't remove the second warning.
Note that clang has a related warning:
    warning: implicit conversion changes signedness: 'int' to 'unsigned int' [-Wsign-conversion]
            unsigned int i = -1;
