For even numbered periods the centered moving average is calculated
incorrectly. Suppose the period length is 5. Then the center of 5 periods is
3. However if the period length is 4 then the center of the period is 2.5. The
value at index 3 should be the average of the values at 2.5 and 3.5. Pandas is
showing the 2.5 value at 3 which is incorrect.
EXAMPLE:  
a=pd.Series(range(1,6), index=range(1,6))  
a.rolling(4, center=True).mean()
1 NaN  
2 NaN  
3 2.5  
4 3.5  
5 NaN
