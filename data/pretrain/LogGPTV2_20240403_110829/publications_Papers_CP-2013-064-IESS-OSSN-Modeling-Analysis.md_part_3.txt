Service value is judged from the perspective of consumers as they compare ser-
vices among the alternatives. For simplicity reasons, we assume that the value
proposition is similar for all service systems and it is the price of the services
calculated from a usdl-price:PricePlan3.

Fig. 3. Service market share evolution overtime
Let us assume that the (re)constructed SN topology shows that overtime
the market share is the one represented in Figure 3 at t = 3. The question to

are not changed (i.e. the value propositions of s remain the same and m≯c ).

According to Bass model [26], the leading service system will reach a fixedpoint
market share according to the following formula (a and b are constants):
1−e−bt
MS(s ,t)= ;0≤t≤9 (1)
i 1+ae−bt
Figure 3 illustrates that from the four services provided, three also rise in
market share during the early stages, reach a peak, and then decline as the
service leader accelerates because of the increasing returns effect of preferential
attachment. In this case, all but one service provided leaves the market, leaving
one monopoly competitor. Such network forecast evolution is of utmost impor-
tance for regulatory bodies such as the European Commission which routinely
passes directives for various markets to avoid monopolistic markets.

the notions of stock and flow diagram, and causal loop diagram should be ac-
counted for. They provide the basis for the quantification and the simulation of
the behavior of the service network overtime. We refer the reader to [9] for a
detailed description of dynamic systems and their representation.

8 Conclusions and Future Work
While network science has made contributions in the areas of social networks
andtheWWW,theconceptofservicenetworksisrecentandpresentsnewchal-
lenges. They are large scale, open, dynamic, highly distributed, and have the
ambitious goal to model worldwide service-based economies. In this paper, we
relied on the General System Theory to identify requirements to develop dy-
namicopensemanticservicenetworks(OSSN),animportantextensiontostatic
OSSN. Requirements related to internal and external relationships between ser-
vices, and change suggested that current models to represent networks should
be extended. Therefore, we adapted the Unified Service Description Language
(USDL) and the Open Semantic Service Relationship (OSSR) model to enable
the representation of dynamic service networks. To demonstrate that the ex-
tensions to USDL and OSSR indeed enabled to model dynamic behavior, we
evaluated their applicability to carry out an evolutionary and analytical analy-
sisofdynamicOSSN.Theresultsarepromisingsincetheyconstitutethefirstset

service-based economies.
For future work, we plan to complement the analysis of the GST with the
analysis of the Viable System Model (VSM), proposed by Stafford Beer, to pro-
vide an additional theoretical conceptualization for OSSN. We also plan to con-
duct a more comprehensive validation by creating a working example to illus-
trate the applicability of the OSSN model and apply it in form of a case study

with primary data. Action research will provide the foundations for validation
and establishing a warranted belief that the OSSN model can contribute to the
understanding, analyse, and design of service systems.
