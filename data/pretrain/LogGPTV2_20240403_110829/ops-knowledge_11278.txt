User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where can I find data stored by a Windows Service running as "Local System Account"? I'm using a service which stores data on disk.
The service is running as "local system account".

Where is the stored data for that system user?

I'm thinking about C:\Documents and Settings\Default User but I'm not sure about that.

Can someone confirm that?

Assistant: The data you are looking should not, by default, be located in "C:\Documents and Settings\Default User".  That is the location of the default user profile, which is the template for new user profiles.  Its only function is to be copied to a new folder for use as a user profile when a user logs onto the computer for the first time.

If the service is following Microsoft's guidelines, it will be storing data in 
the application data folder (%APPDATA%) or the local application data folder (%LOCALAPPDATA% on Windows Vista and later).  It should not use the My Documents or Documents folders, but you might want to check there as well.

On a typical installation of Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, check the following locations for application data for programs running as Local System (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM):


C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Application Data\Vendor\Program
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Local Settings\Application    Data\Vendor\Program
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\My Documents


On a typical installation of Windows Vista and later versions, check the following locations for application data for programs running as Local System (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM):


C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Vendor\Program
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Vendor\Program
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\LocalLow\Vendor\Program
C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Documents


Of course, substitute the appropriate vendor name and program name for Vendor and Program.

[Edit - for bricelam]
For 32 bit processes running on 64 bit windows, it would be in SysWOW64. 


C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData
