Its main goal is to speed up software development and deployment, improve software quality, and enhance team collaboration through cooperation and collaboration between development and operation and maintenance teams. Its workflow includes the following main steps: 1. Planning and analysis: In this step, the development and operation and maintenance teams usually work together to formulate project plans and requirements analysis to ensure more efficient and efficient software development and deployment. smooth. 2. Development and testing: In this step, the development team is responsible for developing code and testing, while the operation and maintenance team is responsible for conducting drills for various environments and configurations to ensure that the software can run in different environments. 3. Deployment and operation and maintenance: In this step, the operation and maintenance team provides the production environment and monitoring services for the software, and uses automated tools to quickly deploy the software and perform updates and configurations. 4. Monitoring and feedback: In this step, the development and operation and maintenance teams jointly use indicators and information to monitor the operation of the software, and improve the functionality and performance of the software based on feedback and user needs. In IT operation and maintenance, the application of DevOps can help enterprises realize automated deployment, continuous delivery, integration testing, continuous integration, etc., thereby speeding up software development and deployment, improving software quality and stability, and optimizing IT service management.
