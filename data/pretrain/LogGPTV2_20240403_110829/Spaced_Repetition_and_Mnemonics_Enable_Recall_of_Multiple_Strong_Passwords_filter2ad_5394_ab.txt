TABLE I: Expected Cost of an Ofﬂine Attack
in the research study, we randomly assigned each participant to
a particular study condition. Members in a particular condition
were assigned a particular number of action-object pairs (either
1, 2, or 4), a particular memorization technique (mnemonic
or text), and a particular rehearsal schedule (e.g., 24hr×2,
12hr×1.5) as determined by the condition.
Participants were then asked to complete a memorization
phase. We randomly selected actions (e.g., swallowing) and
objects (e.g., bike) for each participant to memorize. Partic-
ipants in mnemonic conditions were also assigned pictures
or “scenes,” one for each action-object pair, and were given
speciﬁc instructions about how to memorize their words.
We paid participants $0.50 for completing the memorization
phase. Once participants completed the memorization phase
we asked them to return periodically to rehearse their words.
To encourage participants to return we paid participants $0.75
for each rehearsal, whether or not they were able to remember
the words. If a participant forgot an action-object pair, then
we reminded the participant of the actions and objects that
were assigned and asked that participant
to complete the
memorization phase again.
We restricted our participant pool to those Mechanical
Turk workers who had an approval rate of 95% or better, had
completed at least 100 previous tasks, and were identiﬁed by
Amazon as living in the United States. 797 participants visited
our study website, and 578 completed the memorization phase
and initial rehearsal phase.
A. Recruitment
On the Mechanical Turk website, participants were
recruited with the following text:
Participate in a Carnegie Mellon University re-
search study on memory. You will be asked to
memorize and rehearse random words for a 50
cent payment. After you complete the memorization
phase, we will periodically ask you to return to check
if you still remember the words. If you forget the
words then we will remind you of the words and
ask you to complete the memorization phase again.
You will be paid 75 cents upon the completion of
each rehearsal.
Because this is a memory study we ask that
you do not write down the words that we ask you
to memorize. You will be paid for each completed
rehearsal phase — even if you forgot the words.
B. Memorization Phase
1) Mnemonic group: We ﬁrst describe the memorization
phase for participants assigned to a mnemonic condition.
4
Participants in the mnemonic group were given the following
instructions:
This study is being conducted as part of a
Carnegie Mellon University research project. It is
important that you answer questions honestly and
completely. Please take a minute to read the follow-
ing instructions.
The goal of this study is to quantify the effects
of rehearsal and the use of mnemonic techniques on
long term memory retention. In this study you will
be asked to memorize and rehearse eight random
words (four actions and four objects). During the ﬁrst
phase we will ask you to memorize the eight random
words — you will be paid $0.50 upon completion
of the memorization phase. After you complete the
memorization phase we will periodically ask you
to return via email to check if you still remember
the words. If you forget the words, we will remind
you of the words and ask you to complete the
memorization phase again. You will be paid $0.75
upon the completion of each rehearsal.
Important: Because this is a memory study we
ask that you do not write down the words we ask you
to memorize. You will be paid for each completed
rehearsal phase — even if you forgot the words.
You have been assigned to the mnemonic group,
which means that we give you speciﬁc instructions
about how to memorize the words. One of the
purposes of this study is to determine how effective
certain mnemonic techniques are during the memo-
rization task. We ask that you follow the directions
exactly — even if you would prefer to memorize the
words in a different way.
After participants ﬁnished reading the instructions the
memorization phase proceeded as follows:
Step 1 Initially, participants were shown a photo of an assigned
scene. Participants were next asked to select a famous person
or character from a predeﬁned list (e.g., Darth Vader) and were
shown a photograph of the famous person that they selected
— see Figure 1. Once selected, participants could not change
their person choices. After selecting a person, participants saw
a randomly selected action-object pair. See Appendix A for
the lists of people, actions and objects used in the study.
Step 2 As shown in Figure 2, we asked participants to imagine
a story in which the person they selected is performing the
action in the given scene (e.g., imagine Darth Vader bribing
the roach on the lily pad). We asked participants to type in
this story, with all words in the correct order (Person-Action-
Object).
Step 3 Participants were then required to select photographs of
the action and object, and type in the action and object words
two more times in separate ﬁelds.
We asked most participants to repeat Steps 1 through 3
four times using a new scene (e.g., a baseball ﬁeld or a hotel
room underneath the sea), a new famous person/character and
a new action-object pair during each repetition. Thus, most
participants memorized a total of eight words (four actions
and four objects). After the memorization phase, we asked

Fig. 3: Memorization Steps 1–3 for Text group.
Step 3 Participants were then required to type in the action
and object words two more times in separate ﬁelds.
As with the mnemonic group, we asked most participants
to repeat Steps 1 through 3 four times, and asked participants
to complete a rehearsal phase.
C. Rehearsal Phase
Each participant was assigned a particular rehearsal sched-
ule. The particular times that we ask the participant to return
were given by the rehearsal schedule that participant was
assigned to use (see Table II). We e-mailed participants to
remind them to return for each rehearsal using the following
text:

on the lily pad.
participants to complete a rehearsal phase (See Figure 4) before
leaving the website.
2) Text group: We next describe the memorization phase
for participants assigned to a text condition. Participants in
the text group were given the same instructions as those in the
mnemonic group, with the exception of the last paragraph,
which begins “You have been assigned to the mnemonic
group. . . ” This paragraph is omitted for those in a text con-
dition. After participants ﬁnished reading the instructions, the
memorization phase proceeded as follows:
Step 1 As shown in Figure 3, we randomly selected an action-
object pair, and displayed these words to the participant.
Step 2 We asked each participant to spend one minute mem-
orizing his words. We suggest
that participants imagine a
person performing the action with the object. We asked each
participant to type in a story which includes the action and the
object in the correct order.
Dear Carnegie Mellon study participant: Please
return to (url) to participate in the next part of the
memory study. If you do not return promptly upon
receiving this email, you might not be considered for
future phases of the study. You will receive a $0.75
bonus payment for completing this task and it should
take less than ﬁve minutes.
Remember that you should not write down the
words that were assigned to you. You will be paid
for each completed rehearsal phase — even if you
forgot the words.
...
If, for any reason, you do not want to complete
the study, please reply to this email and let us know
why, so we can improve our protocol for future
studies.
Thank you!

We describe the rehearsal phase below:
1) Mnemonic group: Each participant was shown the scene
and the picture of the person that he chose while memorizing
his ﬁrst story during the memorization phase. We then asked
each participant to recall the assigned action and object for
that story. As shown in Figure 4, actions and objects were
browsable and searchable to aid recall. If the participant was
correct then we moved on to the next story. If the participant
was incorrect then we asked the participant to try again. Each
participant was allowed three guesses per action-object pair.
After three incorrect guesses we asked the participant to repeat

CMU. A while ago you received an e-mail to partic-
ipate in a follow up test. We would like to ask you
to complete a quick survey to help us determine why
participants were not able to return to complete this
follow up study. The survey should take less than a
minute to complete, and you will be paid 25 cents
for completing the survey. The survey consists of
one question. Which of the following reasons best
describes why you were unable to return to take the
follow up test?
A
B
C
D
E
I no longer wished to participate in the study.
I was too busy when I got the e-mail for the
follow up test.
I did not see the e-mail for the follow up
test until it was too late.
I was convinced that I would not be able
to remember the words/stories that I mem-
orized when I received the e-mail for the
follow up test.
I generally do not participate in follow up
studies on mechanical turk.
It is possible that some participants will choose not to
participate in the follow up survey. However, in our case their
decision not to participate is valuable information which sup-
ports our hypothesis, i.e., they are not interested in interacting
with us outside of the initial Mechanical Turk task.
E. Rehearsal Schedules
interval
In our study each participant was randomly assigned to
follow one of the following rehearsal schedules 24hr×2,
24hr×2+2start, 30min×2 and 12hr×1.5. The speciﬁc rehearsal
times for each schedule can be found in Table II. We can
interpret a schedule 24hr×2 as follows: the length of the ﬁrst
rehearsal interval (e.g., the time between initial visit and the
ﬁrst rehearsal) is 24 hours and the length of the i + 1’th
rehearsal
is twice the length of the i’th rehearsal
interval. If the participant was assigned to the 24hr×2 rehearsal
schedule then we would send that participant a reminder
to rehearse 1 day after the memorization phase and if that
participant returned to complete the ﬁrst rehearsal phase then
we would send that participant another reminder to rehearse 2
days after the ﬁrst rehearsal. The next reminder would come
four days later, etc. The ﬁnal rehearsal would take place on
day 1 + 2 + ... + 32 + 64 = 127. In the 12hr×1.5 schedule
the length of the ﬁrst rehearsal interval is 12 hours and after
that intervals grow by a factor of 1.5. The 24hr×2+2start and
30min×2 conditions are similar to the 24hr×2 schedule except
that participants are asked to do a few additional rehearsals on
day 1 — after this the rehearsal intervals are identical to the
24hr×2 schedule.
If a participant did not return to complete a particular
rehearsal round then they were not asked to participant in
subsequent rounds. We stress that this is the only reason why
participants were dropped from the study. A participant who
forgot one or more of his words during rehearsal i would be
reminded of his secret words and would still be invited to
participate in rehearsal i + 1.

pads on the Amazon River provide a cue to aid memory recall.
the memorization phase with the same actions and objects, and
try the rehearsal phase again. Once the participant correctly
entered all assigned action-object pairs, the rehearsal phase
ended and participants were paid automatically.
2) Text group: Each participant from the text group was
simply asked to recall the actions and objects assigned during
the memorization phase. As with the mnemonic group, actions
and objects were browsable and searchable to aid recall. Scor-
ing and payment were handled the same as in the mnemonic
conditions.
D. Follow Up Survey
Some participants did not return to rehearse their stories
during the rehearsal phase. We cannot tell whether or not
these participants would have remembered their passwords if
they had returned. Instead we can only report the fraction of
participants who remembered their passwords among those
who returned for each rehearsal during the study. There are
several reasons why a participant may not have returned (e.g.,
too busy, did not get the follow up message in time, convinced
he or she would not remember the password). If participants
do not return because they are convinced that they would not
remember the password then this could be a source of bias
(i.e., we would be selecting participants who are conﬁdent that
they remember the story). Our hypothesis is that the primary
reason that participants do not return is because they are too
busy, because they did not get our follow up message in time,
or because they are not interested in interacting with us outside
of the initial Mechanical Turk task, and not because they
were convinced that they would not remember the story. In
order to test our hypothesis we sent a follow up survey to all
participants who did not return to complete a rehearsal phase.
Participants were paid 25 cents for completing this survey. The
survey is described below:

We use the following syntactic pattern to denote a
study condition: (Memorization Technique) (Rehearsal Sched-
6
ule) (Number of action-object pairs memorized). For memo-
rization technique we use m to denote the mnemonic groups
and t to denote the text group. Thus, a participant in the group
m 24hr×2 4 refers to a user who was asked to memorize four
actions and four objects using the mnemonic techniques we
suggested and to rehearse his person-action-object stories fol-
lowing the 24hr×2 rehearsal schedule from Table II. Because
most participants were asked to memorize four random action-
object pairs we typically drop the “ 4” from the end of these
conditions.
F. Online studies
The passwords in our study did not protect high-value
accounts, limiting ecological validity. In contrast to real-world,
high-value passwords, study participants would not suffer
consequences beyond a modest time cost if they forgot their
password, nor were they incentivized to keep their passwords
only in memory beyond our repeated requests that they do so.
We recruited participants using Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
Using MTurk allows us to study a larger volume of participants
in a controlled setting than would otherwise be possible.
MTurk workers tend to be younger, more educated, and more
technical than the general population, but they represent a
signiﬁcantly more diverse population than is typically used
in lab studies, which often rely on college-student partic-
ipants [25], [26]. Many researchers have found that well-
designed MTurk studies provide high-quality user data [27]–
[32]. Adar has criticized MTurk studies in general, although
our use of crowdsourcing to understand human behavior ﬁts
his description of an appropriate use [33].
IV. RESULTS
In this section we present the results from our study. In
Section IV-A we overview the raw data from our study (e.g.,
how many participants returned for each rehearsal round?) and
some simple metrics (e.g., how many of these participants
remembered their action-object pairs?) In Section IV-B we
discuss the results of a survey we sent to participants that
did not return for a rehearsal phase. In Section IV-C we
brieﬂy overview Cox regression — a tool for performing
survival analysis that we used to compare several of our study
conditions. In Section IV-D we use the data from our study to
evaluate and compare different study conditions.
A. Study Data
One of the primary challenges in analyzing the results from
our study is that some participants were dropped from the study
because they were unable to return for one of their rehearsals
in a timely manner. We do not know how many of these
participants would have been able to remember their stories
under ideal circumstances. We consider several different ways
to estimate the true survival rate in each condition. Before we
