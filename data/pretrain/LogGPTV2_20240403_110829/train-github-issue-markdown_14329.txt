I have installed Superset on my AWS EC2 instance at the following path:

```
/home/ec2-user/.pyenv/versions/2.7.12/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```

Additionally, I am serving my website securely via SSL from the `/var/www/` directory on the same server. I created a webpage to display the Superset dashboard within an iframe, but I am encountering a mixed-content warning, which prevents the insecure content from being displayed on the secure page.

How can I properly display my Superset dashboards on a secure webpage when the Python environment is in the server user account, and the website is hosted in an SSL-enabled web area?

Thank you for any assistance!
