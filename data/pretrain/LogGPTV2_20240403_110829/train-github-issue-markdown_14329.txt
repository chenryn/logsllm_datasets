My superset is installed on my AWS EC2 instance in:  
/home/ec2-user/.pyenv/versions/2.7.12/lib/python2.7/site-packages
And my SSL is serving my /var/www/ securely on this same server. I created a
webpage to display the dashboard in an iframe but, cannot get it to appear
because of a mixed-content warning - not being able to display insecure
content on a secure page.
How would I display my dashboards on a such a secure page when my python is in
the server user account but, my website is in a SSL-enabled web area?
Thanks for any help!
