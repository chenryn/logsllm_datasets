After upgrading to atom 0.175.0 this morning, the `x` button is no longer
present in the tab header (on hover or otherwise).
Looking in the inspector, the `close-icon` div is present, but nothing is
inside it, nor is any CSS rule causing an 'x' to be rendered.
      app-main.js
I am running Ubuntu 14.04.
