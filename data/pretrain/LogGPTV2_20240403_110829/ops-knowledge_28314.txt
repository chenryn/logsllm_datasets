Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple attempts to establish a connection between two software components, identified by the ids 188978561024 and 3. The connection is repeatedly broken, with the error unspecified, and the SendWorker is interrupted and leaves the thread. The Listener also receives connection requests from two different IP addresses.
