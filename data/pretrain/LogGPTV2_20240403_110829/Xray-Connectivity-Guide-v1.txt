### 1. Introduction
Digital.ai Intelligence Solutions connect to your Xray Cloud database to extract metadata, transaction data, and reference data. This document provides detailed instructions on the necessary configurations for both Xray Cloud and Digital.ai to ensure successful data extraction.

**Note:** We currently do not support the Xray Server version.

### 2. Creating Xray Cloud Users for Digital.ai
To enable Digital.ai to connect to your Xray Cloud instance, you need to create a new user account with the necessary privileges to extract the required data.

**Steps:**
1. **Create a User for Digital.ai:**
   - Create a new user in your Jira Software Cloud instance.
   - Refer to [Jira documentation] for detailed steps.
   
2. **Generate an API Key:**
   - Generate an API key for the newly created user.
   - Refer to [API key generation documentation] for detailed steps.
   
3. **Create Client ID and Client Secret:**
   - For the generated API key, create a Client ID and Client Secret in Xray.
   - Refer to [Xray documentation] for detailed steps.

### 3. Providing Credentials to Digital.ai
After setting up the Xray Cloud user and generating the necessary credentials, you must allow the Digital.ai application to access your Xray instance using these credentials. Digital.ai encrypts your credentials before storing them, and no Digital.ai personnel will have direct access to them. These credentials are used solely for programmatic connectivity to your system.

**Steps:**
1. **Log in to Digital.ai Intelligence Admin Site:**
   - Use the credentials provided by Digital.ai to log in.
   
2. **Navigate to Source Instances:**
   - Ensure you are on the default Source Instances page. If not, navigate to `Modeling > Source Modeling > Source Instances` from the left navigation menu.
   
3. **Select the Correct Instance:**
   - On the Source Instances page, select the correct instance name from the list (e.g., "Xray_Tenant").
   
4. **Configure Application Connection:**
   - Click the `PROPERTIES` tab.
   - Click the `Edit Values` button next to `Application Connection`.
   - In the `End Point URL` field, provide the URL required to access your Xray instance (e.g., `https://your-xray-instance.com`).
   - Enter the OAuth authentication URL, OAuth Client ID, and OAuth Client Secret.
   - Click `Save`.

5. **Test the Connection:**
   - Click the `X` button to exit the dialog box.
   - Click the `Test Connection` button next to `Xray_tenant`.
   - If successful, the message "Sample Extraction Completed" will be displayed in the Test Connection dialog box. Any other message may indicate a failure. It can take up to a few minutes for the final message to display.
   - If the test is not successful or if you are unsure, contact your Customer Success Manager or Digital.ai at [support@digital.ai].
