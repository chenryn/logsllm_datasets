We carefully monitor the CPU, memory, and network uti-
lization of both machines to ensure that resource constraints
do not introduce any artifacts into our experiments.
We run each experiment for 2.5 hours to allow the system
to stabilize and record results only from the last 90 minutes
of each experiment. This allows the coordinates to stabilize
for the Coordinates and Tor+Coordinates strategies, and the
bandwidth weightings to properly adjust for SB-s and Tor.
6.1 Establishing Trafﬁc Levels
As discussed in Section 3.4, establishing an appropriate
level of trafﬁc is difﬁcult when modeling the Tor network.
Our goal is to select a level of congestion that is on par with
that found on the live Tor network.
We alter the number of clients to tune the level of con-
gestion in our emulated Tor network. To select a level of
congestion that matches Tor, we compare the throughput

achieve a median throughput of 85 KBps, outperforming all
other selection strategies, although Tor (81 KBps) is only
4.7% worse. Strategies that apply either little or no weight
to bandwidth perform poorly: Unweighted Tor nets a me-
dian throughput of just 22 KBps, while LASTor has a me-
dian throughput of 24 KBps.
The latency metrics follow a similar trend. Here
Congestion-aware performs the best with a median time-to-
ﬁrst-byte of 1.321 seconds, 8.5% better than Tor, and 10.7%
better than SB-9. Notably, while LASTor remains poor at
time-to-ﬁrst-byte, it actually performs reasonably in P-RTT;
its median P-RTT of 1.41 seconds is only 12% worse than
SB-9 and much better than that of Unweighted Tor, Coor-
dinates and SB-3. This is unusual considering both metrics
measure latency. We suggest that the difference is due to
a distinction that strongly affects LASTor: time-to-ﬁrst-byte
incorporates TCP connect time, while P-RTT does not be-
gin measuring until a connection is established. Since LAS-
Tor optimizes the latency across the full path between client
and destination, the destination must be known before a Tor
circuit can be established. Time-to-ﬁrst-byte captures the
time required for LASTor to pick and extend an appropri-
ate path each time a new application request is received. By
contrast, Tor normally maintains a set of established circuits
and simply routes new trafﬁc over one of them.
In Figures 11 and 12, we explore the performance of
the relay selection strategies in networks with resp. high
and low congestion. In the highly congested environment,
throughput and time-to-ﬁrst-byte suffer across the board.
Tor, SB-9 and Tor+Coordinates perform similarly, with me-
dian throughput of 46 KBps, 47 KBps, and 44 KBps re-
spectively. Somewhat surprisingly, Coordinates also does
reasonably well, with a median throughput of 43 KBps.
The other less bandwidth-focused strategies produce me-
dian throughput of less than 33 KBps. Congestion-aware,
by virtue of its focus on avoiding congestion, performs the
best by a considerable margin with a median throughput of
53.8 KBps.
The Congestion-aware strategy continues to be effec-
tive when performance is measured in time-to-ﬁrst-byte.
Congestion-aware outperforms all other strategies with a
median time-to-ﬁrst-byte of 1.87 seconds, 14%, 21%, and
27% faster than SB-9, Tor, and Tor+Coordinates respec-
tively. Similarly, LASTor continues to have impressive
P-RTT times (although not
throughput or time-to-ﬁrst-
byte): under high congestion, its 1.31 seconds are the sec-
ond lowest at the median, behind only Congestion-aware.
In a low-congestion environment (Figure 12), through-
put is considerably higher, and time-to-ﬁrst-byte lower, due
to reduced trafﬁc and congestion. Bandwidth remains an
important factor in path selection, with a clear delineation
between strategies that weight heavily for bandwidth and

and time-to-ﬁrst-byte experienced in our emulation to per-
formance data collected from the live network in March
2012 [47]. As shown in Figure 9, with 100 active clients
(three of which are bulk clients), our emulated throughput
matches that of the Tor network almost exactly, while our
time-to-ﬁrst-byte is 32% faster at the third quartile, but only
6% faster at the median and 5% slower at the ﬁrst quartile.
While our use of 100 active clients approximates the per-
formance of the current live Tor network, we also evalu-
ate relay selection strategies under both less and more se-
vere congestion conditions. Speciﬁcally, we emulate 25 and
175 clients in the “low” and “high” congestion conﬁgura-
tions, respectively, to evaluate performance for possible fu-
ture conditions on the Tor network.
6.2 Performance Results
Homogeneous networks. We ﬁrst consider a homoge-
neous network in which all clients adopt identical relay
selection strategies. Figure 10 shows the cumulative dis-
tribution of measured client throughput, time-to-ﬁrst-byte,
and P-RTT for a network experiencing a medium level of
congestion.
(For readability, we adopt the convention of
listing the labels in the ﬁgures’ keys in order of the cor-
responding curves’ median values, while maintaining the
same line types between ﬁgures.) There is a distinct dif-
ference in performance between the selection strategies that
use bandwidth to inﬂuence their selection and those that do

those that do not. The former category is led by SB-9 which
exhibits 45% better throughput than Tor. With the lower
level of congestion, our Tor+Coordinates selection strategy
is also able to improve upon Tor by 22%. Similar to the re-
sults for medium and high congestion networks, strategies
that do not focus heavily on bandwidth do not perform par-
ticularly well.
SB-9 and Tor+Coordinates have the lowest time-to-ﬁrst-
byte, both with median times under one second. At their
medians, they respectively perform 14% and 17% better
than default Tor.
We see that even under low congestion, Unweighted Tor

forms reasonably when performance is measured in terms
of P-RTT. Congestion-aware continues to perform well but
with less distinction, likely due to low levels of congestion.
Heterogeneous networks. We also explore the effects
of relay selection when some clients elect to run a differ-
ent relay selection strategy. This scenario is likely in incre-
mental deployments, and additionally models application-
tunable anonymity [42] in which clients select a relay selec-
tion policy to meet their underlying applications’ communi-
cation requirements. When evaluating heterogeneous selec-
tion, 20% of clients use a speciﬁc selection method, while
the remaining 80% use Tor. We present the median, 10th-,
and 90th-percentiles of throughput, time-to-ﬁrst-byte, and
P-RTT for this heterogeneous selection under medium con-
gestion in Table 3. We also show (1) the performance of the
80% of the clients that use the vanilla Tor client, and (2) the
percentage improvement of the non-Tor strategy over Tor.
SB-9, Tor+Coordinates, and Congestion-aware respec-
tively provide performance improvements between 9% and
12% in throughput and time-to-ﬁrst-byte, while other selec-
tion strategies generally under-perform compared to Tor.
Our results indicate that even in a heterogeneous envi-
ronment, a selection strategy that does not use bandwidth
weighting (e.g., Coordinates) performs poorly relative to
the majority of clients who use Tor. Even small numbers

6.4 Summary
Our emulation results demonstrate that congestion aware
routing offers an improvement
in anonymity and per-
formance, especially under heavily congested conditions.
Tor+Coordinates also shows potential for improvement
over Tor’s standard relay selection, posting modest beneﬁts
in throughput over Tor’s default bandwidth-weighted strat-

width to obtain reasonable performance.
7. Discussion
6.3 Security Analysis
The entropy and Gini coefﬁcients for the various relay
selection strategies in the medium congested network are
presented in Table 4. Tor+Coordinates, SB-9, and Tor have
the highest Gini coefﬁcients and the lowest entropy, indicat-
ing that the set of relays used by those selection strategies is
smaller and less diverse than that used by Unweighted Tor,
SB-3, or Coordinates. There is a strong correlation between
better performance and a more selective relay selection
strategy, conﬁrming that within the context of anonymity
systems, performance is a commodity that requires a trade-
off with anonymity. Congestion-aware impressively shows
high performance while giving up less anonymity than Tor.
Comparing Tables 2 and 4, we ﬁnd that our results gen-
erally agree between our simulation and emulation exper-
iments. The main outlier is LASTor, which exhibits an
entropy greater than, and Gini coefﬁcient less than, Un-
weighted Tor. We believe that this is due to LASTor’s entry
node distribution, where the entry node is the ﬁrst hop in a
path (not necessarily a guard, see Section 3.1), which when
One clear result of our performance evaluation is the
critical importance of bandwidth to any effective relay se-
lection strategy. The live Tor network is heavily oversub-
scribed and most network performance characteristics be-
come irrelevant when bandwidth is the constraining fac-
tor. Our results show that strategies that weight heavily
for bandwidth perform better than those that weight only
lightly, and much better than those that do not do so at all.
In particular, under our medium congestion level, the me-
dian throughput achieved by Tor, Congestion-aware, SB-9
and Tor+Coordinates were all at least 70 KBps, while Un-
weighted Tor and LASTor — the two strategies that ignore
bandwidth — both produced median throughput of less than
25 KBps.
One outlier is the Coordinates strategy, which often
achieved throughput similar to SB-3 without weighting on
bandwidth. A likely explanation is that there is an inher-
ent correlation between bandwidth and latency when empir-
ically measured. While the cost of pings in the coordinate
system is not large, a low-bandwidth relay will be slower
to respond than a high-bandwidth one. Additionally, there
