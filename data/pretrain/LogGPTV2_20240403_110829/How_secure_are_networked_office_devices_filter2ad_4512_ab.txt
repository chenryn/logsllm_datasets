services included in our scans. 
The  second  tool  we  used  was  HP  Web  Jetadmin  [17,18] 
which  is  software  developed  and  distributed  by  HP.    It  helps 
system administrators configure, monitor, and manage both HP 
and  some  non-HP  networked  print  devices.  The  discovery 
process  involves  the  use  of  the  simple  network  management 
protocol (SNMP) [19].  However, an HP document states that 
devices  using  an  SNMP  Get  community  name  other  than 
“public” will not be discovered by the tool [20].

466We  installed  and  ran  version  8.1  of  this  tool  from  a 
computer  located  on-campus  at  the  University  of  Maryland.  
While version 8.1 is no longer supported or updated by HP, we 
choose to run this version of the tool because it is available for 
both  the  Windows  and  Linux  operating  systems.    It  was  also 
important  to  run  the  software  from  an  on-campus  location 
because SNMP traffic is blocked from entering or leaving the 
campus  network. This  restricts  the  usefulness of  this  tool to a 
scan of devices on-campus where the scan also originates from 
on-campus.    However,  if  an  attacker  has  access  to  an  already 
compromised  on-campus  machine,  the  tool  could  be  installed 
and  used  to  acquire  information  by  an  attacker  from  off-
campus. 
While  the  HP  Web  Jetadmin  scan  may  be  slightly  more 
limited in terms of the devices it can discover and that it must 
be run from a host connected directly to the campus network, it 
has  the  ability  to  collect  a  richer  set  of  information  about  the 
devices  using  just  the  default  settings.    This  includes  device 
specific  information  regarding  hardware  present  (such  as  the 
presence  and  size  of  any  internal  disk  drives),  installed 
firmware  version,  and  the  status  of  some  security  related 
settings (such as the use of an administrative password).  Often 
the  same  information  can  be  obtained  through  one  of  the 
devices  management  interfaces  (via  a  web  browser  or  telnet 
client),  but  may  involve  more  effort  to  collect.    A  more 
complete  collection  and  analysis  of  information  via  SNMP 
could  provide  additional  useful 
regarding 
configurations and vulnerabilities but was beyond the scope of 
our study.  We were primarily interested in using the HP Web 
Jetadmin  tool  as  an  alternate  method  of  device  discovery  to 
compare with the nmap scan results. 
information 
Both tools were first used to scan two smaller subnets (with 
a  total  of  ~300  active  IP  addresses  in  use).    The  two  subnets 
were  chosen  because  we  could  obtain  physical  access  to  all 
machines  attached  to  the  network  and  could  physically  verify 
the  results  of  the  scan.    We  focused  on  devices  connected 
directly to the network and we did not include printers attached 
to PCs with network sharing enabled. 
There  was  considerable  overlap  between  the  two  tools  in 
terms of devices found.  However, there were cases where the 
scan  results  from  only  one  of  the  tools  indicated  a  device  of 
interest.  If some of the default services had been disabled or if 
access  to  services  had  been  restricted,  an  nmap  scan  may  not 
have obtained  sufficient information  to  make  a determination, 
but  if  the  same  device  had  SNMP  enabled,  then  HP  Web 
Jetadmin may list the device.  The opposite can also happen, if 
support  for  SNMP  was  not  present  or  had  been  disabled,  the 
device  may  only  appear  in  the  results  of  the  nmap  scan.    Of 
course,  we  can  not  rule  out  the  possibility  or  likelihood  that 
some devices of interest were not found because they had been 
secured  or  configured  in  a  manner  so  that  they  would  not  be 
detected or identified by our scans.  We did not encounter such 
a case in our small-scale testing.   
B.  Threat model 
The  STRIDE  threat  model  was  originally  developed  by 
Microsoft.  The name comes from the types of threats included 
which are listed below along with some relevant examples. 
Spoofing  identity:    Impersonating  or  pretending  to  be  an 
authorized user or person  with authority to either gain access 
or convey misinformation.

sending something from the device as someone else 
Tampering  with  data: 
information stored on or during transmission with the device. 
  Altering,  deleting,  or  adding 
• 
• 
eavesdropping  and  altering  communications  with

Repudiation:  Bypassing accounting or logging functions such 
that a record of usage or actions is not created or accurate.

C.  Vulnerabilities 
There  are  several  resources  describing  and  discussing 
vulnerabilities related to networked office devices.  Some have 
been  consolidated  into  references  or  guides  [21,22]  while 
others  may  be  found  in  vulnerability  databases  [23]  and 
vendors may release vulnerability related information [24]. 
Exploitation  of  software/firmware  vulnerabilities  is  not 
required for these devices to pose risks to privacy and security.  
In  some  cases,  simply  using  the  device  with  its  default 
configuration  presents  vulnerabilities  to  various  threats.    For 
example,  if  users  are  not  aware  that  scanned  or  copied 
documents are being stored and are also publicly accessible, the 
threat  of  information  disclosure  is  applicable.    Or,  if  network 
access control lists (ACLs) have been set but do not cover all 
forms  of  management  access  and  are  not  protected  by  a

(either

We  looked  for  the  presence  of  several  different  types  of 
vulnerabilities 
in 
software/firmware)  that  could  be  mapped  to  threats  of  most 
concern  to  the  university  and/or  that  were  likely  to  be 
applicable  to  a  large  number  of  devices.    Not  all  applicable 
vulnerabilities were evaluated. 
configurations 
or 
The threat of highest concern was information disclosure of 
PII.  The primary vulnerability examined that was applicable to 
this  threat  was  configurations  that  permitted  public  access  to 
stored documents  (to  either on  or off-campus  networks).  The 
threat of privilege elevation from off-campus was judged to be 
next in level of importance followed by the threat of on-campus 
privilege  elevation.    We  were  also  interested  in  gauging  the 
denial  of  service  threat,  but  deemed  it  of  less  concern  for 
immediate remediation efforts. 
D.  Data gathering 
We  performed  initial  nmap  scans  for  both  of  the  class  B 
network address space allocated to the university.  The output 
of the initial scan was then used to identify candidates for more 
follow-up scanning.  The results of the scans were then parsed 
using  some  perl  scripts  and  additional  data  collection  was 
performed.  While additional scripts were used to collect data, 
some  information  was  collected  or  verified  manually.    The 
following  are  some  of  the  information  we  were  interested  in 
obtaining.  Not all information could be gathered for each host. 
Open ports:  By parsing the nmap output, we established a list 
of  devices  and  their  open  ports.    Hosts  were  identified  as 
candidate  devices  and  subject  to  additional  checks  based  on 
the set of listening ports. 
Device name/model:  If a  web interface is accessible, it often 
displays  a  default  or  index  page  indicating  the  manufacturer 
and/or  model  of  the  device.  When  possible,  this  make  and 
model  were  retrieved  using  regular  expressions  to  parse  the 
HTML source of the default web page.  For some devices, this 
information  could  also  be  obtained  through  telnet  or  rsh 
management interfaces or by manual viewing. 
Telnet availability and password:  If the telnet port was open, 
we  used  an  Expect  [25]  script  to  test  if  a  password  was 
required  for  access.    Output  from  the  host  in  response  to  the 
script  enable  us  to  assess  if  the  telnet  service  was  reachable 
and  if  the  service  required  a  login  and  password,  or  if  the 
service could be accessed without a password. 
FTP  availability  and  password:   We  checked  if  the  FTP  port 
was open and whether it was password protected. We used an 
Expect  script  similar  to  the  one  used  to  check  telnet 
availability. 
Accessibility off-campus:  We scanned for open ports from an 
off-campus IP address and compared the results to scans from 
an on-campus IP address. 
Web interface password:  If a password was required to access 
some  administrative  settings  via  the  web  interface,  some 
devices  would  display  a  slightly  different  default  page.    One 
check  performed was to parse the HTML source of the page to  
Figure 1.   Overview by device manufacturer 
look  for  the  presence  of  elements  indicating  a  password  was 
required  for  administrative  access.    Another  check  was  to 
attempt  to  access  certain  URLs  on  the  device  which  would 
require a password to access if a password had been set.  Many 
devices  made  by  the  same  manufacturer  use  similar  directory 
structures for their web interfaces.  If access was permitted to 
the default web page but denied to a normally protected area, 
this  could  indicate  that  a  password  was  needed  to  access  the 
protected area. 
Number  of  publicly  available  documents:    For  devices  that 
allowed  access  to  document  server  functions,  manual  checks 
using  the  web  interface  were  performed  to  count  the  number 
of  publicly  available  documents  and  to  assess  if  documents 
with PII or other sensitive content were accessible. 
In addition  to  the  nmap  scans  and related  scripts, we  used 
the  HP  Web  Jetadmin  tool  to  perform  device  discovery  and 
data collection.  We could then process, compare and combine 
the results with the nmap data.  For devices discoverable with 
the HP Web Jetadmin tool, more information could be obtained 
about the devices in an automated fashion.  However, much of 
the  information  available  via  the  SNMP  protocol  is  also 
accessible  through  the  other  device  management  interfaces 
(telnet/rsh/web).    Some  additional  information  collected  using 
the  HP Web Jetadmin  tool  included  the  firmware  version and 
the amount of internal storage space present.
