User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Best way to troubleshoot apache not starting? We have recently gotten a backup server to mirror all our data onto in case the primary server goes down.

I've gotten all the sites data updated through rsync, and all the apache config and databases updated. Both machines are on Ubuntu 9 (9.04 on the primary, 9.10 on the backup).

So everything seems synced up for the most part at this point (still need to figure out user syncing), and I try to start Apache. I get

* Starting web server apache2                                       [fail]


Nothing else indicating what the problem could be.

I know I don't have enough info to expect a solution from you guys, so I'd just like to know where I can go from here to further investigate this issue. Would there be any error logs for this?

Thanks!

Assistant: httpd -t will test the syntax of your configuration files and spit out any errors to the terminal.
