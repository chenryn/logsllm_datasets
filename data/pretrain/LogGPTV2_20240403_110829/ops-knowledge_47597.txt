User: Googled around and looked on this forum but couldn't find if I can pause a download using lftp.
Currently downloading tons of logs and would like to pause, add more drives to the system and continue downloading.
Thanks
Assistant: You can either suspend the whole lftp process (command suspend) or limit transfer rate to e.g. 1Bps (set net:limit-total-rate 1). In either case the files being transferred remain open.
You can also stop the transfer and continue it later using -c option of get or mirror.
