the Mall is frequented by a wider range of people with respect to
the University, which is mainly frequented by students who are typ-
ically on a budget. Finally, notice how the Others (∼ 60% of Apple
devices) dataset shows a distribution very similar to that of the Mall
dataset. Both datasets, in fact, represent a rather uniform sample of
population. Overall, these results suggest that difference in vendor
distribution between two events might reveal a signiﬁcant differ-
ence in the people that participated to them. The most compelling
evidence of this fact is that the difference in age and socioeconomic
status we observed between supporters of Politics 1 and Politics 2
parties is well represented by their difference in terms of popularity
of Apple devices.
4.6 Temporal analysis on the University
data-set
As opposite to the other datasets, which have been collected
during one-shot events, the University dataset is the result of a
6 weeks long observation period performed from a ﬁxed vantage
point at the campus entrance.
In this section we show how this
long-term dataset allows to characterize the social dynamics of an
observed area and to get further insights on its target population.
Also, we study the correlation between co-occurrence of people
and the strength of their social relationship as inferred by using the
Adamic-Adar metric. Our studies are related to those regarding the
characteristics of human social behavior [18, 35].
4.6.1 Recurrent patterns
Figure 11(a) reports the number of new (solid column) and known
(dashed column) devices that were detected in each day of obser-
vation. Figure 11(b) reports, instead, the number of detected de-
vices in a sample day. Our observations are consistent with the
intuition that students’ life is very predictable. Indeed, according
to Figure 11(a), the number of detected devices abruptly decreases
in correspondence of both week-ends and days when courses are
suspended due to seasonal vacations (e.g., Week 1). Plus, consis-
tently across all working days, the number of detected devices has a
peak around lunch time (Figure 11(b)) and decreases in the evening.
Also the repetitive schedule typical of students’ life is captured in
this dataset, as it takes only a few days for the number of newly
detected devices to drop down to 30% of the total (Figure 11(b)).
This suggests that the probability that a student does not visit the
campus for more than a couple of working days in a row is small.
In fact, most of them visit the campus with a very high frequency,
which is conﬁrmed by Figure 12 where we plot the distribution
of the number of times the devices were detected in different time
slots of 1 hour. According to the distribution, 40% of the devices
were detected more than 100 times (∼ 2 times per day on average).
Overall, these results show how a long-term collection of probes
requests adds a further dimension to the characterisation of a tar-
get population. In our case, we found a number of properties that
match the typical students’ movements patterns. This complements
the other insights we inferred on students’ language and socioeco-
nomic status.
4.6.2
As observed in other contexts [8, 13, 36], the simultaneous pres-
ence of pairs of people in a given place denotes the existence of a
possible social relationship between them. At the same time, the
Adamic-Adar similarity we deﬁned in Section 4.3 is based on a
similar intuition, as it assigns a higher strength to social links con-
necting people that are more likely to frequent the same places.
Intuitively, there should be a correlation between these two ways of
inferring social links. The long-term University dataset allows to
conﬁrm this by verifying whether increasing values of the Adamic-
Adar similarity between two devices correspond to a higher proba-
bility of their simultaneous occurrence. To do so, we ﬁrst divide the
time in slots of 120 seconds, which are sufﬁciently large to allow
most of the devices to transmit their probes. Then, we group pairs
of devices together in buckets according to their Adamic-Adar sim-
ilarity. Finally, we average the number of co-occurrences observed
for the pairs in each bucket. The results, shown in Figure 13, con-
ﬁrm our hypothesis, as we can observe a positive correlation be-
tween the Adamic-Adar similarity and the average number of co-
occurrences (Pearson coefﬁcient 0.858. 1-tailed p-value < 0.005).

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Probe requests, both broadcast and directed ones, are a useful
tool that enables energy-limited mobile devices to efﬁciently and
transparently discover available access points and switch between
them. The goal of this work was to show that, besides from their
basic utility, smartphone probes actually bring insightful and inter-
esting information about a crowd at an event or about a target pop-
ulation. To fully investigate this idea, we organized a three months
long campaign of probe collection. During our campaign we tar-
geted scenarios differing in both terms of scale and characteristics
of the population involved: From campus and city-wide, to national

and international scenarios. As a result we collected more than
11M probes sent by more than 160K different smartphone devices
overall.
In this paper, we presented an in-depth study of these novel
and large-scale datasets. The most important ﬁndings of our study
are the following: First, we developed an automated methodology
through which to derive the underlying relationship graphs between
the users in each scenario, and showed how all these graphs feature
properties that are typical of social networks—user and SSID de-
grees distributed as a power law, short diameter, high clustering co-
efﬁcient and so on. Then, we studied how, in our social networks,
groups of interconnected people tend to choose the same device
vendor with a probability that increases with the strength of their
social relationship. These results support the theory of homophily
and social inﬂuence between people living in geographical prox-
imity. We also performed, for the ﬁrst time, language detection on
the broadcast SSIDs, and exploited the vendor ID to show how the
probes can directly reﬂect the sociological aspects of the people
involved in each scenario like nationality, age, and socioeconomic
status.
We believe this is just a ﬁrst step towards a new, non invasive
methodology for uncovering non-online social networks. As a fu-
ture work, we plan to include information regarding the location
of the networks referred to by the probes. This could be done, for
instance, by using crowd sourced databases of 802.11 networks ob-
served around the world, like Wigle6. This extra information will
help us to achieve an even stronger characterization of the sample
of the population contained in our datasets.
