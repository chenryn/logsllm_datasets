### The Mall vs. The University: Demographics and Device Distribution

The Mall is frequented by a diverse range of individuals, in contrast to the University, which is primarily visited by students who are typically on a budget. Notably, the "Others" category, comprising approximately 60% of Apple devices, exhibits a distribution similar to that of the Mall dataset. Both datasets represent a relatively uniform sample of the population. These results suggest that differences in vendor distribution between two events can reveal significant differences in the demographics of the participants. For instance, the observed differences in age and socioeconomic status between supporters of Politics 1 and Politics 2 parties are well reflected in their preference for Apple devices.

### 4.6 Temporal Analysis of the University Dataset

In contrast to the other datasets, which were collected during one-time events, the University dataset was gathered over a six-week observation period from a fixed vantage point at the campus entrance. This long-term dataset allows us to characterize the social dynamics of the observed area and gain deeper insights into its target population. Additionally, we study the correlation between the co-occurrence of people and the strength of their social relationships, as inferred using the Adamic-Adar metric. Our studies are related to research on the characteristics of human social behavior [18, 35].

#### 4.6.1 Recurrent Patterns

Figure 11(a) shows the number of new (solid column) and known (dashed column) devices detected each day during the observation period. Figure 11(b) reports the number of detected devices on a sample day. Our observations align with the intuition that student life is highly predictable. As shown in Figure 11(a), the number of detected devices drops significantly during weekends and days when courses are suspended due to seasonal vacations (e.g., Week 1). Across all working days, the number of detected devices peaks around lunchtime (Figure 11(b)) and decreases in the evening. The repetitive nature of student schedules is also evident, as the number of newly detected devices quickly drops to about 30% of the total within a few days (Figure 11(b)). This suggests that it is unlikely for a student to be absent from the campus for more than a couple of consecutive working days. Most students visit the campus frequently, as confirmed by Figure 12, which plots the distribution of the number of times devices were detected in different one-hour time slots. According to this distribution, 40% of the devices were detected more than 100 times (approximately twice per day on average). Overall, these results demonstrate how long-term data collection adds a valuable dimension to the characterization of a target population. In our case, we found several properties that match typical student movement patterns, complementing the insights we gained about their language and socioeconomic status.

#### 4.6.2 Correlation Between Co-occurrences and Social Relationships

As observed in other contexts [8, 13, 36], the simultaneous presence of pairs of people in a given place indicates a possible social relationship between them. Similarly, the Adamic-Adar similarity defined in Section 4.3 is based on the idea that social links connecting people who frequent the same places are stronger. Intuitively, there should be a correlation between these two methods of inferring social links. The long-term University dataset allows us to confirm this by verifying whether higher Adamic-Adar similarity values between two devices correspond to a higher probability of their simultaneous occurrence. To do this, we first divide the time into 120-second slots, which are sufficiently large to allow most devices to transmit their probes. We then group pairs of devices into buckets based on their Adamic-Adar similarity and average the number of co-occurrences observed for the pairs in each bucket. The results, shown in Figure 13, confirm our hypothesis, as we observe a positive correlation between the Adamic-Adar similarity and the average number of co-occurrences (Pearson coefficient 0.858, 1-tailed p-value < 0.005).

### 5. Conclusions and Future Work

Probe requests, both broadcast and directed, are a useful tool that enables energy-limited mobile devices to efficiently and transparently discover available access points and switch between them. This work demonstrates that, beyond their basic utility, smartphone probes provide insightful and interesting information about a crowd at an event or a target population. To fully investigate this idea, we conducted a three-month probe collection campaign targeting scenarios differing in scale and population characteristics, from campus and city-wide to national and international settings. During our campaign, we collected over 11 million probes from more than 160,000 different smartphone devices.

In this paper, we presented an in-depth study of these novel and large-scale datasets. Our key findings include the development of an automated methodology to derive the underlying relationship graphs between users in each scenario, showing that these graphs feature properties typical of social networks, such as power-law distributed user and SSID degrees, short diameters, and high clustering coefficients. We also found that groups of interconnected people tend to choose the same device vendor with a probability that increases with the strength of their social relationship, supporting the theory of homophily and social influence. We performed language detection on broadcast SSIDs and used vendor IDs to reflect sociological aspects of the people involved in each scenario, such as nationality, age, and socioeconomic status.

We believe this is just the beginning of a new, non-invasive methodology for uncovering non-online social networks. Future work will include incorporating information about the location of the networks referred to by the probes, possibly using crowdsourced databases of 802.11 networks observed worldwide, like Wigle. This additional information will help us achieve an even stronger characterization of the population in our datasets.
