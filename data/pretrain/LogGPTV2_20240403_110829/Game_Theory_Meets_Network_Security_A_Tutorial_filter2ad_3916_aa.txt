## Abstract
The increasing connectivity of modern information systems presents new challenges to security. Traditional security measures, while effective for well-defined goals like confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity, can be cost-prohibitive in the face of sophisticated attacks and complex systems. A new perspective and theoretical foundation are needed to address these challenges. Game theory offers a natural framework for understanding the strategic interactions between attackers and defenders, providing quantitative assessments of security, predicting outcomes, and enabling security-by-design. This tutorial provides an overview of game-theoretic methodologies, including games of incomplete information, dynamic games, and mechanism design, to underpin a modern science of cybersecurity. It also discusses open problems and research challenges, aiming to build a multidisciplinary bridge between cybersecurity, economics, and decision theory.

## Tutorial Description
Contemporary information and communication technology is evolving rapidly, not only in sophistication but also in diversity. The increasing complexity, pervasiveness, and connectivity of today's information systems present new security challenges. With 24/7 connectivity becoming integral to daily life, protecting information, identities, and assets has become more critical than ever. While traditional security measures have made significant progress in protecting well-defined goals such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity, they often fall short against advanced persistent threats (APTs) and social engineering attacks that compromise cryptographic keys.

Game-theoretic models provide a natural framework to capture the adversarial and defensive interactions between players. These models offer a quantitative measure of protection through the concept of Nash equilibrium, where both defender and attacker seek optimal strategies, and no one has an incentive to deviate unilaterally from their equilibrium strategies. This approach also allows for the prediction of security outcomes and the design of mechanisms that can shift the equilibrium in favor of the defender.

Over the past decade, game and decision theory have become a systematic and powerful theoretical foundation for security research. Unlike traditional security definitions, game and decision theory adopt an economic viewpoint, where security is achieved when attacking a system becomes more expensive than not attacking. This approach complements purely technological security means by analyzing and creating incentives to encourage honest behavior rather than just preventing maliciousness.

This tutorial aims to introduce diverse game-theoretic methodologies, including mechanism design, incentive analysis, decision-making under incomplete information, and dynamic games, to provide a solid foundation for a science of cybersecurity. The tutorial will cover various classes of games and their applications to different security problems, such as:

1. **Stackelberg and multi-layer games** for proactive defense.
2. **Network games** for cyber-physical security, focusing on critical infrastructure protection and information assurance.
3. **Dynamic games** for adaptive defense in network security.
4. **Mechanism design theory** for the economics of network security, investigating resource allocation methodologies.
5. **Game-theoretic analysis** of cryptographic concepts, such as perfect confidentiality and authentication in classical and quantum networks, network design, and quantitative security risk management.

From a cybersecurity perspective, the tutorial will cover recent applications of game theory to emerging topics such as cross-layer cyber-physical security, cyber deception, moving target defense, critical infrastructure protection, adversarial machine learning, insider threats, and cyber risk management. The tutorial will also discuss open problems and research challenges, with the goal of building a multidisciplinary bridge between cybersecurity, economics, and decision theory.

The potential audience includes researchers from academia and industry, including PhD and graduate students. Some background in network security and basic optimization and data science is helpful but not necessary. The tutorial will last 1.5 hours.
