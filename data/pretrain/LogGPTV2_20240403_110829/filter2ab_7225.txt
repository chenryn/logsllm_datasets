**ATT&CK ID:** T1552.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Private Keys

Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems to exploit insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys and certificates are essential for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. Common file extensions for these keys and certificates include: `.key`, `.pgp`, `.gpg`, `.ppk`, `.p12`, `.pem`, `.pfx`, `.cer`, `.p7b`, and `.asc`.

By locating and extracting these files, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, impersonate legitimate users, or decrypt encrypted data. It is crucial to ensure that private keys and certificates are securely stored and protected with strong access controls to mitigate this risk.
