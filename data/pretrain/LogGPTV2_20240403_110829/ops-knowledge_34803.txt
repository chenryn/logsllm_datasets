User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题IIS7Register failed with HRESULT 800700b7: 'Cannot create a file when that file already exists.' I am trying to re-install ASP.NET on IIS7 running in Win7/64, which magically stopped working all of as sudden. 

When I run aspnet_regiis -i, I get an error message that says 

Finished installing ASP.NET (4.0.30319).
Setup has detected some errors during the operation. For details, please read the setup log file C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\ASPNETSetup_00031.log

Looking at the log, it reports 

Failure    Changing IIS ApplicationHost.config: IIS7Register failed with HRESULT 800700b7: 'Cannot create a file when that file already exists. '

The real problem surfaces when trying to access an ASP.NET web page from that server: 

HTTP Error 500.21 - Internal Server Error
Handler "PageHandlerFactory-Integrated" has a bad module "ManagedPipelineHandler" in its module list

and 

Most likely causes:
Managed handler is used; however, ASP.NET is not installed or is not installed completely. 
There is a typographical error in the configuration for the handler module list.

So it seems ASP.NET has NOT been properly re-installed. Now, I am aware of the alleged one-and-only remedy for this, repeated all over the Web, and referenced for example here:

Except that the proposed solution does not work for me. I have expanded the %windir% macros within isapiCgiRestriction section for .NET 4.0 - and aspnet_regiis still fails for me.

Any other ideas?

Assistant: I should mention that the problem went away as soon as I installed the RTM version of Visual Studio 2012. Like user110684, I did initially install the preview of what was then called VS11 and that may have been what did us both in. At any rate, after installing the final release of VS2012, along with .NET 4.5 that comes with it, I no longer see the problem.
