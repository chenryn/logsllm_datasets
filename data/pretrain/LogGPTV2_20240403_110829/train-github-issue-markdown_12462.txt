# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
It would be useful to have a shortcut that would cycle all applications that
are currently in Fanzy Zones. That is,
  * the application that was in zone 1 would move to zone 2
  * 2 -> 3
  * 3 -> 4
  * 4 -> 1
(This example applies to a 4-zone configuration)
The workflow I'm imagining is, if you are multitasking with >3 applications,
you could cycle which one of them appears in a larger, "priority" zone, while
the rest are delegated to smaller, "standby" zones.
