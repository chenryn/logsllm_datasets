User: In order to improve the reliability and stability of the application, it is inevitable to implement load balancing among the servers. Please provide a load balancing solution and technical requirements suitable for the application.
Assistant: The load balancing solution suitable for this application is a software-based load balancing technology using the open source project HAProxy. Its technical requirements include: 1. Server cluster: at least three physical servers are required in the server cluster. 2. Static IP address: Each server in the cluster needs to be assigned a static IP address. 3. Software: HAProxy needs to be installed and configured on each server. 4. Monitor: A monitor needs to be installed in the server cluster to monitor the status and load of the server. 5. Security: The load balancer and each server need to be secured to avoid any malicious attack or data leakage. 6. Network bandwidth: It is necessary to provide sufficient network bandwidth to handle a large amount of website visits and data transmission. 7. Logging: HAProxy logs need to be recorded and analyzed in order to detect and resolve any problems in a timely manner. The above technical requirements can provide high availability, high performance and high scalability load balancing solution to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
