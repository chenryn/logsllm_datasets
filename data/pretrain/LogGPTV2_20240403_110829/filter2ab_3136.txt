**ATT&CK ID:** T1596.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

Adversaries may search for and exploit data from content delivery networks (CDNs) to gather information about potential victims, which can be used during the targeting phase of an attack. CDNs enable organizations to host and deliver content through a distributed network of servers, providing improved performance and load balancing. Additionally, CDNs often offer the capability to customize content delivery based on the geographical location of the requestor. This customization can inadvertently provide adversaries with valuable information about the organization's infrastructure and user base.
