# Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) Performance Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This paper presents a systematic study of the performance and quality of experience (QoE) metrics for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in the United States. The goal is to understand the differences in performance between MVNOs and their base carriers, as well as among different MVNOs within the same family.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Video Streaming
We evaluated video streaming performance by measuring TCP throughput and its impact on video quality. The results are shown in Figure 6, which compares two MVNO families (A and B). We observed that:
- **Family A**: Experiences fewer video load failures.
- **Family B**: B1 experiences the most type (2) video load failures, related to radio dormancy issues discussed in Section 3.1.

### 2.2 Voice Calls
#### 2.2.1 Setup and QoE Metrics
To measure call setup times and audio quality, we developed a custom auto-dial application and a recipient phone application. The setup includes:
- **Auto-Dial Application**: Automatically calls a number at different locations and times.
- **Recipient Phone Application**: Logs the time of the first ring, accepts the call, and ends it immediately.
- **Synchronization**: Ensured using the ClockSync Android app, with a synchronization error ≤ 10 ms.

#### 2.2.2 Audio Quality Measurement
- **Audio File**: Played a 3-minute audio file on a laptop and recorded the incoming audio on the phone.
- **Cross-Correlation**: Computed the cross-correlation of Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) between the reference and recorded audio files.
- **Call Quality Score**: Normalized the cross-correlation value by dividing it by the score when cross-correlating the MFCCs of the original file with itself.

### 2.3 Evaluation
Figure 7 shows the distribution of call setup times and audio quality scores for the different carriers:
- **Setup Time**: MVNO family A has a median call setup time of 5-6 seconds. MVNO family B, specifically B2 and B3, have a 1.5-second higher median call setup time.
- **Audio Quality**: No significant differences in audio quality across the providers.

## 3. Other Applications

### 3.1 Upload Speeds
We measured upload speeds to a reference campus server. The results, shown in Figure 8, indicate that:
- **MVNO Family B**: Performs significantly worse than the base carrier B.
- **MVNO Family A**: Performs similarly to the base carrier A.

### 3.2 Video Chat (Google Hangout)
- **Experiment Setup**: Established a 5-minute chat from the phone to a well-provisioned laptop, playing a video in front of both devices.
- **Results**: No significant difference in performance between the base carrier and their MVNOs for both A and B families. This is attributed to:
  - **UDP Traffic**: Does not go through the explicit proxy.
  - **Dynamic Bitrate Adaptation**: Unlike YouTube, which chooses a static bitrate at the start.

### 3.3 Traffic Shaping and Port Blocking
- **Tools Used**: BonaFide and Netalyzr.
- **Findings**:
  - **BitTorrent, VoIP-H323, RTSP-based Apps**: No evidence of application-specific traffic shaping.
  - **Port Blocking**: MVNO family A does not exhibit any port blocking, while MVNO family B shows more diverse blocking behavior.

### 3.4 Coverage
- **Metrics Logged**: Serving cell-id, signal strength (RSSI/RSCP/RSRP), link layer technology used.
- **Driving Experiments**: Covered major routes within the map in Figure 1.
- **Results**: Carriers in each MVNO family connect to similar sets of cell-ids, with no statistically significant difference in signal strength or link-layer technology used.

### 3.5 Quota Usage
- **Study**: Correlated performance for different applications vs. data usage amount for every billing cycle.
- **Results**: No observed throttling behavior for either MVNO family.

## 4. Related Work
- **Mobile Measurements**: Previous studies have focused on characterizing traffic usage patterns, but not on MVNOs.
- **Tools and Datasets**: Crowd-sourced solutions like FCC’s broadband measurement tool, OpenSignal, and OOKLA Speed Test focus on network-level metrics and do not measure user-perceived QoE metrics.

## 5. Conclusions
Our analysis shows that while MVNOs share the network infrastructure of the base carriers, there is visible performance degradation in QoE metrics for some MVNOs. Further, MVNOs in the same family do not perform equally, and the two MVNO families behave differently. Deeper analysis reveals structural and lower-layer differences, including the use of proxies, varying latencies, and loss rates.
