proxy does not respond to the initial request from the client causing
the client to timeout. Speciﬁcally, B1 experiences the largest num-
ber of type (2) video load failures; this is related to radio dormancy
issues discussed in Section 3.1.
3.3 Voice calls
Setup and QoE metrics: We created a custom auto dial applica-
tion that is scripted to automatically call a number. This application
runs on all 4 phones at different locations and times of the day. We
also setup a recipient phone in the lab, and we build and run an-
other custom application on this phone to log the time of the ﬁrst
ring, accept the call, and then immediately end the call. Because
the Android top-level framework does not allow us to automatically
answer/end a call, we mimicked a Bluetooth Headset request to au-
tomatically answer the call and used lower-layer APIs for ending
the call. With this setup we compute the Call Setup Time or the
time elapsed between the time the caller makes a call and when the
callee receives it. To ensure that the caller/receiver are in sync, we
use the ClockSync [16] Android app. We separately veriﬁed that
the synchronization error was ≤ 10 ms (not shown); this sufﬁces
for our analysis as we look for user-perceivable (e.g., ≥ 100ms)
differences in performance.
To measure the audio quality, we establish calls between each
of the 4 phones and a Google Voice number on a laptop. We play
a 3 minute (based on average audio call durations) audio ﬁle on
the laptop and record the incoming audio to the phone.To mini-
mize background noise we direct the audio output from the phone
to the recorder via a standard 3.5mm cable. We compute the cross-
correlation of the Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefﬁcients (MFCCs),
(recommended in the audio/speech processing literature [27]), be-
tween the reference audio ﬁle and the recorded audio ﬁle. We nor-
malize this value by dividing it by the score attained when cross-
correlating the MFCCs of the original ﬁle with itself, and we call
this normalized value the Call Quality Score.
Evaluation: Figure 7a shows the distribution of the call setup time
for the different carriers. MVNO family A showed fairly similar

values for call setup times (median of 5-6 seconds). With MVNO
family B, we notice that B2 and B3 have a 1.5 second higher me-
dian call setup time. However, this difference cannot be attributed
to any client-side metric we collected. Figure 7b shows the Call
Quality Score for the two MVNO families. In this case, we do not
observe signiﬁcant differences across the providers.5 Since the dis-
crepancy in quality is low, unlike the data experiments, we do not
perform any further factor analysis.
4 Other Applications
In addition to the three usage scenarios discussed in the previous
section, we also conduct smaller-scale measurements to capture
other common user concerns. We brieﬂy summarize the main ob-
servations from these experiements.

Uploads: Web and video workloads are largely download-bound.
Users are increasingly using phones to upload content (e.g., Insta-
gram, Vine). To understand the impact on such applications, we

LTE). Hence, audio voice calls are sent over a channel separate
from the data channel, and thus voice is not impacted by differ-
ences on the data channel.

ence campus server in Stony Brook. Figure 8 shows similar charac-
teristics to our previous experiments— MVNOs in MVNO family
B perform signiﬁcantly worse than base carrier B, whereas base
carrier A and its MVNOs perform roughly similarly.
.
Video Chat (Google Hangout): We pick a popular video chat
application – Google Hangout and evaluate its performance across
carriers. We establish a chat (5 minutes long) from the phone to a
well-provisioned laptop and play a video in front of the phones and
the laptop using another screen. We collect packet traces at both
ends. We repeat our experiments at 3 different locations, lab and
two residential areas. We analyze frames/sec received at the lap-
top as well as the sending and receiving UDP throughputs. We did
not observe any signiﬁcant difference between the base carrier and
their MVNOs for both A and B MVNO families. One interesting
observation is that video chat shows no performance differences
on MVNOs in MVNO family B, which is unlike the case of video
streaming (Section 3.2). We speculate that this is due to a combi-
nation of two reasons: (1) chat trafﬁc uses UDP and does not go
through the explicit proxy and (2) unlike the YouTube video which
chooses a static bitrate at the start, Hangout uses dynamic bitrate
adaptation. (Recall that most of the problems in MVNO family B
was the poor choice of initial bitrate via the proxy.)
Trafﬁc Shaping and Port Blocking: Users like to know if
MVNOs throttle or block less common applications. This is par-
ticularly relevant as we have seen use of proxies (Section 3.1)
and use of middleboxes in cellular networks [37] is well-known.
We use two tools, Bonaﬁde [17] and Netalyzr [6], as they pro-
vide complementary coverage over the set of application tests. We
used this to study 3 different types of applications: (1) BitTorrent,
(2) VoIP-H323 and (3) RTSP-based apps. We found no evidence
of application-speciﬁc trafﬁc shaping for these protocols, in both
MVNO families. Additionally, Netalyzr reveals that while MVNO
family A does not exhibit any port blocking, MVNO family B ex-
hibits more diverse blocking behavior. For example, B blocks TCP-
based SIP and UDP access to NetBIOS-NS servers. While B3 and
B2 do not block any ports, B1 blocks many application ports (FTP,
PPTP, NTP, NetBIOS-NS, NetBIOS-DGM, IKE Key Exchange).
Coverage: As seen in our user quotes, users want to know
if MVNOs get the same coverage/treatment as the base carriers
(e.g., [10]). As discussed earlier, we logged relevant lower-layer
information—serving cell-id, signal strength (RSSI/RSCP/RSRP),
link layer technology used (e.g., EDGE, HSPA, HSPA+). In addi-
tion, we did a number of driving experiments covering major routes
within the map in Figure 1. We found that in general, the carriers
in each MVNO family connect to a similar set of cell-ids in a given
location and that there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
signal strength or link-layer technology used.
Quota usage: Another common concern for users is whether
carriers start throttling before the actual usage quotas are reached
(e.g., [9]). We correlated the performance for different applications
vs. the data usage amount for every billing cycle. We did not ob-
serve throttling behavior for either MVNO family. A detailed study
of this subject via more controlled experiments is an interesting
direction of future work, especially in light of known accounting
discrepancies (e.g., [32]).
5 Related Work
With the growth of mobile trafﬁc, there are several prior and ongo-
ing efforts in mobile measurement. While the tools and techniques
[3], OpenSignal
they use are similar to our work, the key difference is that these
have not focused on the MVNO phenomenon to characterize dif-
ferences across MVNOs or MVNOs vs. base carriers.
Mobile measurements: Previous studies have measured mobile
performance from the infrastructure-side [26, 28, 31, 33] and the
client-side [20, 21]. These focus primarily on characterizing traf-
ﬁc usage patterns, which is orthogonal to our work. Wang et al.
showed how middlebox effects (e.g., timing out idle TCP connec-
tions) can have a huge impact on the mobile application perfor-
mance [37]. Huang et al. compare different carriers on a range of
applications across different smartphone hardware [25]. However,
their study did not cover MVNOs. More recent studies analyze
performance variability within carriers [30] and diagnose causes of
high latency in cellular networks [39]. These are interesting factors
to further dissect MVNO performance.

These focus mostly on network-
level metrics (e.g., latency, throughput, signal strength) and do not
measure user-perceived QoE metrics which is our primary focus.
Bashko et al. developed the Bonaﬁde tool to detect trafﬁc shaping
and service differentiation [17]. Netalyzr is also a powerful tool for
detecting port blocking, proxies, and DNS issues [6]. We leverage
these two tools and apply them to study MVNOs.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a ﬁrst attempt to shed light on a re-
cent and growing trend in the mobile market: mobile virtual net-
work operators or MVNOs. While these have been growing in
market share, there are natural concerns about their performance
and there has been little work done on systematically understand-
ing this area. To ﬁll this gap, we conducted a systematic measure-
ment study with two major MVNO families in the US. Our analysis
shows that while the MVNOs share the network infrastructure of
the base carriers, there is visible performance degradation in qual-
ity of experience metrics for common mobile phone applications
for some MVNOs. Further, MVNOs in the same MVNO family
do not perform equally, and the two MVNO families behave dif-
ferently. Deeper analysis reveals a range of structural and lower-
layer differences across MVNO families and MVNOs, including
use of proxy, varying latencies and loss rates, data activity dor-
mancy issues and various forms of blocking/denials. We hope that
our observations motivate and trigger future deeper and large-scale
studies, across larger regions, more MVNOs and more variety of
data plans, perhaps by using mobile measurement platforms being
deployed in the wild.
