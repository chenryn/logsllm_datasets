Assistant: This log chunk is related to the startup of various software components and the connection of devices. The kernel is completing a Bluetooth connection (0x8800) and setting the AWDL operation mode to AUTO. The networkd is evaluating a connection (QQ.10018) and the UserEventAgent is authenticating a connection (en0). The blued is terminating a host controller and the QQ is allocating a task (2019353853). Lastly, the kernel is completing a Bluetooth connection (0x2800) and the QQ is failing to connect due to a lack of network route (26042).
