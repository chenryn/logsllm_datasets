ABSTRACT
This paper presents the design and implementation of the ﬁrst in-
band full duplex WiFi radios that can simultaneously transmit and
receive on the same channel using standard WiFi 802.11ac PHYs
and in typical SNR regimes achieve close to the theoretical dou-
bling of throughput. Our design uses a single antenna for simul-
taneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex
system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation tech-
niques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise ﬂoor, and
therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal.
We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards
and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software ra-
dio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works
robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the ex-
pected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice.

INTRODUCTION
“It is generally not possible for radios to receive and
transmit on the same frequency band because of the in-
terference that results."
(Andrea Goldsmith, Wireless Communications [8])
The above quote captures a long-held assumption in wireless system
design that radios have to operate in half duplex mode (i.e., either
transmit or receive but not both simultaneously) on the same chan-
nel. Recent work has attempted to invalidate this assumption. Re-
searchers at Stanford [11, 3], Rice [7, 6] and several other groups in
industry and academia [14, 1] have proposed various designs to build
in-band full-duplex radios. Full duplex, if possible, has tremendous
implications for network design, not least of which is the fact that
cellular networks could cut their spectrum needs by half. For ex-
ample, LTE uses equal width separate uplink and downlink channels
to enable radios to achieve full duplex. With an in-band full-duplex
system we could use a single channel to get the same performance.

Consequently, the problem has attracted signiﬁcant attention, both
from industry and academia and has spurred signiﬁcant follow-up
work.
To achieve full duplex, a radio has to completely cancel the sig-
niﬁcant self-interference that results from its own transmission to
the received signal. Since WiFi signals are transmitted at 20dBm
(100mW) average power, and the noise ﬂoor is around −90dBm, the
transmit self-interference has to be canceled by 20dBm−(−90dBm) =
110dB to reduce it to the same level as the noise ﬂoor and render it
negligible. If self-interference is not completely canceled, any resid-
ual self-interference acts as noise to the received signal and reduces
SNR and consequently throughput. For example, if the received sig-
nal’s SNR without full duplex is 25dB but is reduced to 5dB due
to 20dB residual self-interference, then the throughput with full du-
plex is that achieved using two 5dB SNR links. This is signiﬁcantly
worse than using the original half duplex link with 25dB SNR and it
is better to turn off full duplex in this case. To sum up, the amount
of self-interference cancellation dictates overall throughput and is a
ﬁgure of merit for any full-duplex design.
Prior designs have made signiﬁcant progress on the self-interference
cancellation problem [11, 5, 3]. However the best performing prior
designs can at best provide 85dB of cancellation, which still leaves
about 25dB of residual self-interference and therefore reduces the
SNR of each direction of the full duplex link by 25dB. A calculation
similar to the previous paragraph’s shows that to see throughput ben-
eﬁts with these full-duplex designs, the half-duplex SNR of the link
has to be extremely high (45dB or higher). In terms of range, the
two nodes would have to be closer than 5m to see such high SNRs.
Outside this range, it is better to turn off full duplex and use the tra-
ditional half duplex mode. To be fair however, these designs were
intended for low-power, narrow-band, ﬁxed rate protocols such as
Zigbee where 85dB of self-interference cancellation is sufﬁcient for
full duplex. WiFi is far more demanding both in terms of bandwidth
as well as cancellation.
Prior designs also need to have at least two antennas [11, 5] in
place of the one used by half duplex systems (one each for transmit
and receive and possibly more [3]). However, with two or more an-
tennas, the argument for full duplex becomes weaker since the same
doubling of capacity could be obtained by using the two antennas as
MIMO antennas to spatially multiplex two independent packets in
half duplex mode instead of using them for full duplex.
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a full
duplex WiFi radio that uses a single antenna 1 and delivers close to
1Picasso [10] uses a single antenna, but it only allows the radio to
simultaneously transmit and receive on different adjacent channels.
Hence it fails to address the much harder problem of simultaneous
TX/RX on the same channel. Our system does address this chal-
lenge, and offers novel and higher performance analog and digital
cancellation techniques compared to Picasso.

Our key technical contributions are novel self-interference cancella-
tion circuits and algorithms that provide the required 110dB of self
interference cancellation for standard WiFi signals and thus elim-
inate all self interference to the noise ﬂoor. Our design is wide-
band: it works with the highest bandwidths (80MHz) and data rates
used by the latest 802.11ac PHY in the 2.4GHz spectrum. We also
experimentally demonstrate a complete full-duplex communication
link which uses the full WiFi PHY (OFDM, constellations up to
256QAM and all the channel coding rates) and achieves close to the
theoretically expected doubling of throughput. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst working implementation of a complete
WiFi PHY single-antenna full-duplex link.
The reader might be wondering why full duplex is hard to real-
ize. After all, as the sender knows the signal being transmitted, sub-
tracting it should be relatively simple to implement. One of the key
insight in this work is that in fact the radio does not know what it
is transmitting. What it does know is the clean digital representa-
tion of the signal in baseband. However, once the signal is converted
to analog and up-converted to the right carrier frequency and trans-
mitted, the transmitted signal looks quite different from its baseband
incarnation. The numerous analog components in the radio TX chain
distort the signal in both linear and non-linear ways (analog circuits
will create cubic and higher order components of the signal for ex-
ample), add their own noise (e.g., power ampliﬁers add transmitter
noise), are slightly inaccurate (e.g., your oscillator is tuned slightly
off 2.45GHz), or delay it by different amounts at different frequen-
cies and so on. In effect the transmitted signal is a complicated non-
linear function of the ideal transmitted signal along with unknown
noise. Unsurprisingly, naively subtracting a “known” baseband ver-
sion of the transmit signal without accounting for all these analog
distortions does not work. As we will show in Sec 5 prior designs
fail to account for these distortions and hence are limited to at best
85dB of cancellation.
This paper makes two key contributions over all prior work in this
space. First, we design dynamic algorithms to estimate the distor-
tions introduced by analog circuits and accurately model the actual
self-interference being experienced by the received signal. Second,
we design a novel programmable analog cancellation circuit using
off-the-shelf components that allows us to implement the above al-
gorithm in “analog” and dynamically cancel the self-interference.
Such analog cancellation prevents receiver saturation from strong
self-interference and allows us to use commodity radios. However,
the analog cancellation stage does not completely cancel the self-
interference. We complement it with a novel digital cancellation al-
gorithm and implementation that cancels any remaining self-interference.
Our digital cancellation algorithm differs from all prior work because
it not only models the linear distortions, but also non-linear effects
and other special effects such as oscillator noise. Thus, overall we
use a hybrid analog-digital design that successfully models all linear
and non-linear distortions as well as transmitter noise.
We implement our design via a combination of circuit designs and
software implementations. Our analog cancellation is implemented
on a PCB that we designed and populated using off-the-shelf compo-
nents. We integrate our board with an off-the-shelf antenna and soft-
ware radio transceiver [16, 15] based on test equipment from Rohde-
Schwarz (RS) as well as on commodity WARP radios. We also im-
plement our digital cancellation algorithms as well as a fully WiFi
compliant PHY layer based on OFDM, supporting constellations up
to the standard required 256QAM and all the channel coding rates.
We deployed and evaluated our system in an indoor and noisy ofﬁce
environment in the 2.4GHz ISM band, operating the WiFi PHY over
Figure 1: What we think we are transmitting in digital on the left side, and
what the radio actually transmitted on the right side. The actual transmitted
signal differs signiﬁcantly from the two tones generated in digital baseband.
Note transmitter noise and harmonics are generated in addition to the two

the 80MHz bandwidth on RS radios, and over the 20MHz bandwidth
using WARP radios.
Our experiments demonstrate that our design delivers on the promise
of full duplex. Under typical indoor deployment scenarios, our sys-
tem delivers a median throughput gain of 87% in practice with WiFi
radios which is close to the theoretically expected 2×. Looking into
the cancellation itself, we show that our design consistently deliv-
ers the required 110dB of cancellation in a dense indoor ofﬁce en-
vironment for both the RS 80MHz radios as well as the commod-
ity 20MHz WARP radios. The system is robust to environmental
changes, reﬂections, and can handle all the different constellations
used in WiFi. We compare against the best known prior full duplex
approaches [11, 7] and show experimentally that they can at best
deliver 85dB of cancellation and therefore reduce the SNR of the
received signal by at least 25dB.
2. THE PROBLEM
Full duplex, in theory, should be simple to accomplish. After all,
we know the signal we are transmitting and we are only designing
circuits and algorithms to subtract it from the received signal. The
intuition follows from the conventional abstraction that the analog
radio (also known as the RF front-end) is a black-box that takes the
digital baseband signal, converts it to analog, up-converts it to the
carrier frequency, scales it to the right power and sends it. In other
words, the assumption has been that the radio preserves the original
baseband signal except for power scaling and frequency shifting. In
practice this abstraction turns out to be incorrect. Radios in fact sig-
niﬁcantly distort the signal being transmitted, relative to the digital
baseband representation.
To demonstrate the distortions, we use the following experiment
throughout this section. We take a software radio transceiver [16, 15]
and send the following signal: two tones at 2.449GHz and 2.451GHz.
In other words, we are sending an extremely simple signal, two sine
waves with frequencies 1MHz away from the carrier frequency of
2.45GHz. We do this by creating a digital baseband signal with sam-
ples of the sine waves at −1MHz and 1MHz which the radio then
up-converts to 2.45GHz and ampliﬁes to 20dBm average transmit
power (the power used by WiFi radios). We then compare the signal
output of the antenna to what we would ideally expect if the radio did
not introduce any distortions. This experiment serves as some sort of
lower bound on the quality of radios. If radios cannot transmit even
this simplest of signals without distortion then more complex signals
such as WiFi are likely to be signiﬁcantly distorted. Fig. 1 plots the
ideal and actual transmitted signals’ spectra that resulted from our
experimental set-up (we ensured that this was a clean environment
with no other interference present in the environment at the time of
the experiment).
376Ideally, we expect to see only two tones at 2.451GHz and 2.449GHz
as shown on the left side of Fig. 1. However in the transmitted sig-
nal, whose spectrum is plotted on the right side of Fig. 1, we can
easily see that there are several other distortions present in addition
to the two main tones that were transmitted. These distortions can be
classiﬁed into two major categories:
1. Linear Components: This corresponds to the two main tones them-
selves which are attenuated and could consist of reﬂections from the
environment. These are linear components because the received dis-
tortion can be written as a linear combination of different delayed
copies of the original two tones.
2. Non-Linear Components: These components are created because
radio circuits can take in an input signal x and create outputs that
contain non-linear cubic and higher order terms such as x3, x5.
These higher order signal terms have signiﬁcant frequency content
at frequencies close to the transmitted frequencies, which directly
correspond to all the other harmonics we see on the right side of
Fig. 1. Harmonics, as the name suggests, are signal distortions
which occur at equally spaced frequency intervals from the trans-
mitted frequencies. As the right side of Fig. 1 shows, we see spikes
at frequencies 2.447GHz and 2.453GHz, that are spaced 2MHz
apart from the two transmitted tones 2.451GHz and 2.449GHz, on
either side.
3. Transmitter Noise: The general increase we see in the base signal
level which we can clearly see on the sides of the two main tones is
noise from the radio transmitter. A radio will of course always have
noise, which works out to a noise power level of -90dBm [15]). But
as we can see, the power at the side-bands is signiﬁcantly higher, on
the level of −50dBm, or 40dB higher than the thermal noise ﬂoor.
This extra noise is being generated from high power components in
the radio transmitter such as power ampliﬁers. In the radio literature
this is referred to as broadband noise [12]. Further radios have phase
noise generated by local oscillator (LO), which is typically of level
of −40dBm, or 50dB above (not seen in the Fig. 1).
2.1 Requirements for Full Duplex Designs
The above analysis suggests that any in-band full duplex system
has to be able to cancel all the above distortions in addition to the
main signal component itself, since all of these are within the fre-
quency band we are transmitting and receiving on and act as strong
self-interference to the received signal itself. In this section, we dis-
cuss how strong each of these components are for typical transceivers,
and what are the requirements for full duplex. We will state all self-
interference power levels relative to the receiver noise ﬂoor. The
reason is that to implement full duplex, we need to cancel any self-
interference enough so that its power is reduced to the same level as
the receiver noise ﬂoor. There is no point in canceling beyond that
since we won’t see any beneﬁts — the received signal’s SNR will
then be dictated anyway by the receiver noise ﬂoor which cannot be
