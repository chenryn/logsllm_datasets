User: Please list some commonly used network security attack and defense technologies, such as DDoS, SQL injection, etc., and the corresponding defense strategies.
Assistant: 1. DDoS attack: Distributed denial of service attack, which occupies the bandwidth and resources of the target website through a large number of requests, resulting in unavailable services. Defense strategies include avoiding exposure of real IP addresses as much as possible, enhancing network bandwidth, setting filtering rules, etc. 2. SQL injection: By injecting SQL statements into the input box, bypassing verification and control, obtaining the authority or confidential information of the target website. Defensive strategies include using parameterized queries when writing code, restricting and filtering input boxes, etc. 3. XSS attack: Cross-site scripting attack, by implanting malicious scripts in the website, stealing user information or manipulating website content. Defense strategies include restricting user input, using content security policies, and filtering input of special characters, etc. 4. CSRF attack: cross-site request forgery attack, which tampers with some operations or information of the target website visited by the user to complete the attacker's own intention. Defense strategies include adding anti-counterfeiting marks, using verification codes, verifying source sites, etc. 5. The file contains a vulnerability: By entering the access path, the access control is bypassed, and important files on the server are read or tampered with. Defense strategies include restricting access rights, judging paths based on incoming parameters, disabling certain functions, etc. 6. Phishing (Phishing) attack: Forge legitimate emails or websites to defraud users of important information such as account passwords. Defensive strategies include enhanced training and awareness, use of security credentials, checking links and sources, and more. 7. Brute force attack: Break through password control by trying all possible password combinations. Defensive strategies include increasing the complexity and length of passwords, setting up account locking mechanisms, etc. 8. Backdoor attack: use known or unknown vulnerabilities to implant a backdoor on the server to obtain server permissions. Defense strategies include monitoring and auditing of servers, regular system and application upgrades, detection of malicious traffic, and more.
