### Apache Airflow version
Other Airflow 2 version (please specify below)
### What happened
Airflow Version: 2.4.2  
In my organization, I need to run an SSHOperator to execute a script that
triggers a spark-submit task. I encountered a situation where I had to rerun a
specific execution, so I cleared the state of the task. However, I noticed
that there were two distinct applications running on YARN when there should
have been only one. This occurred three times in total.

From the log, I observed that each line is being logged twice. I'm curious to
know if there is any connection or reason behind this duplication. I have
`remote_logging` to be true.
