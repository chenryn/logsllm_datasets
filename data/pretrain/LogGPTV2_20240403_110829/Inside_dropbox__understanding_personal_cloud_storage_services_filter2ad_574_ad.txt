Figure 11: Data volume stored and retrieved from
Dropbox in each household.
5. SERVICE WORKLOAD
5.1 Storage Volume
In this section we correlate ISP customers (IP addresses)
in home networks and the total storage volume in retrieve
and store operations. The amount of retrieved and stored
data per household is depicted in Fig. 11. Each IP address
is represented by a point and diﬀerent symbols are used
to illustrate the number of devices behind the IP address.
Note that we placed all cases with less than 1kB on the
axes because of the logarithmic scales. The ﬁgure accounts
only for transfers made from the Dropbox client. Similarly
to Sec. 4.4, the typical overhead of SSL negotiations were
subtracted from the transferred amount.
Fig. 11 shows that Dropbox users tend to download more
than upload. This is visible in the density of points below the
diagonals. Overall, the total downloaded data in Campus 2
is 2.4 times higher than the total uploaded data. This ratio
is equal to 1.6 and 1.4 in Campus 1 and Home 1 , respec-
tively. Home 2 is an exception: The ratio is around 0.9 in
this network. Some customers massively uploading content
created this divergence. These customers appear on the top
right corner of Fig. 11(b). Note that one of these customers
is also responsible for the bias in the CDF depicted in Fig. 7.
In both datasets, four usage scenarios can be identiﬁed:
(i) Occasional users, which abandon their Dropbox clients,
hardly synchronizing any content (points close to the ori-
gins); (ii) upload-only users that mainly submit ﬁles (points
close to the y-axes); (iii) download-only users, executing pre-
dominantly retrieve operations (points close to the x-axes);
(iv) heavy users that both store and retrieve large amounts of
data (points along the diagonals). The proportion of users in
each group explains the overall relation between downloads
and uploads seen in Fig. 11.
Tab. 5 quantiﬁes the groups. The IP addresses are divided
according to the following heuristics: IP addresses that have
less than 10kB in both retrieve and store operations are in-
cluded in the occasional group; IP addresses that have more
than three orders of magnitude of diﬀerence between upload
and download (e.g., 1GB versus 1MB) are included in either
download-only or upload-only; all others are in the heavy
group. For each group, the table shows the group percent-
age of IP addresses and sessions, the total transferred data,
the average number of days in which the devices were seen
on-line, and the average number of devices per household.
The occasional group represents around 30% of the total
IP addresses in both vantage points. As expected, customers
in this group exchange a negligible amount of data and stay
on-line in Dropbox less time when compared to others. They
also have the lowest average number of devices. This group,
therefore, marginally generates any load to the system.
The upload-only group accounts for around 7% of the IP
addresses, and is responsible for a signiﬁcant amount of up-
loads (21% in Home 1 and 11% in Home 2 ). Considering
their low number of devices, users in this group seem to be
interested in Dropbox for backups and for the submission
of content to third-parties or to geographically dispersed
devices. The opposite behavior can be concluded for the
download-only group. This group is, however, very signiﬁ-
cant in both number of IP addresses (26% in Home 1 and
28% in Home 2 ) and transferred volume (25% and 28%, re-
spectively). Similarly to the upload-only group, a moderate
number of devices per IP address is seen in this group.
Finally, accounting for 37% of IP addresses in Home 1 and
33% in Home 2 , the heavy group is responsible for most of
the volume transferred by Dropbox clients. Customers in
this group have a high number of devices (above 2 on aver-
age), appeared on-line more than 60% of the days in our cap-
ture and are responsible for more than 50% of the Dropbox
sessions. The usage of Dropbox for synchronization of de-
vices in a household seems to be the typical scenario in this
group. Those are, therefore, the users causing the biggest
impact on both system workload and network utilization.
5.2 Devices
In this section we describe the distribution of the num-
ber of devices residing in the same LAN. Devices connected
to the same LAN can make use of the LAN Sync Protocol
for synchronizing ﬁles without retrieving duplicated content
from the cloud. Fig. 12 depicts the distribution of the num-
ber of devices per IP address in Home 1 and Home 2 .
In around 60% of the households using the Dropbox client,
there is only a single device linked to the service. Most of the
remaining households have up to 4 devices and, not surpris-
ingly, are part of the heavy group identiﬁed in the previous
section. By inspecting a subset of notiﬁcation connections
in Home 1 , we observed that in around 60% of households

Figure 13: Number of namespaces per device.
with more than 1 device (around 25% of the total), at least
1 folder is shared among the devices. This further conﬁrms
our ﬁndings about the typical use of Dropbox among heavy
users for the synchronization of devices. Since the LAN Sync
Protocol traﬃc does not reach our probes, we cannot quan-
tify the amount of bandwidth saved in these households by
the use of the protocol. We can conclude, however, that no
more than 25% of the households are proﬁting from that.
The remaining users always rely on central storage data-
centers for their data transfers.
5.3 Shared Folders
In order to measure to what extent Dropbox is being
used for content sharing or collaborative work, we analyze
namespace identiﬁcations in Home 1 and Campus 1 traf-
ﬁc (in Home 2 and Campus 2 this information was not ex-
posed). Fig. 13 shows the distribution of the number of
namespaces per device. By analyzing Campus 1 data in dif-
ferent dates, it is possible to conclude that the number of
namespaces per device is not stationary and has a slightly
increasing trend. Fig. 13 was built considering the last ob-
served number of namespaces on each device in our datasets.
In both networks the number of users with only 1
13% in
namespace (the users’ root folder) is small:
Campus 1 and 28% in Home 1 .
In general, users in
Campus 1 have more namespaces than in Home 1 . The
percentage of users having 5 or more namespaces is equal to
50% in the former, and 23% in the latter. When consider-
ing only IP addresses assigned to workstations in Campus 1 ,
each device has on average 3.86 namespaces.
5.4 Daily Usage
We characterize whether the use of the Dropbox client has
any typical seasonality. Fig. 14 shows the time series of the
number of distinct devices starting up a Dropbox session in
each vantage point per day. The time series are normalized
by the total number of devices in each dataset. Around 40%

of all devices start at least one session every day in home
networks, including weekends.10
In campus networks, on
the other hand, there is a strong weekly seasonality.
At a ﬁner time scale (1 hour bins), we observe that the
service usage follows a clear day-night pattern. Fig. 15 de-
picts the daily usage of the Dropbox client. All plots were
produced by averaging the quantities per interval across all
working days in our datasets.
Fig. 15(a) shows the fraction of distinct devices that
start a session in each interval, while Fig. 15(b) depicts the
fraction of devices that are active (i.e., are connected to
Dropbox) per time interval. From these ﬁgures we can see
that Dropbox usage varies strongly in diﬀerent locations,
following the presence of users in the environment. For in-
stance, in Campus 1 , session start-ups have a clear relation
with employees’ oﬃce hours. Session start-ups are better
distributed during the day in Campus 2 as a consequence
of the transit of students at wireless access points. In home
networks, peaks of start-ups are seen early in the morning
and during the evenings. Overall, all time series of active
devices (Fig. 15(b)) are smooth, showing that the number
of active users at any time of the day is easily predictable.
10Note the exceptions around holidays in April and May.

Figure 15: Daily usage of Dropbox on weekdays.
Fig. 15(c) and 15(d) depict the fraction of the total num-
ber of bytes exchanged in each time interval in retrieve and
store functions, respectively. Fig. 15(c) shows that the num-
ber of bytes received in retrieve operations has a correlation
with client start-ups. This suggests that the ﬁrst synchro-
nization after starting a device is dominated by the down-
load of content produced elsewhere, instead of the upload of
content produced while oﬀ-line. Although other patterns are
visible in the ﬁgures, such as the concentration of downloads
in the morning in Campus 1 and in the evening in Home 1 ,
both series are still very noisy at this level of aggregation.

Figure 16: Distribution of session durations.
5.5 Session Duration
We analyze the session duration based on the TCP ﬂows
to notiﬁcation servers. Home 1 , Home 2 , and Campus 2
have a similar behavior in general, as shown in Fig. 16, with
an exception for the number of short-lived sessions. In both
home networks, a signiﬁcant number of notiﬁcation ﬂows
are terminated in less than 1 minute. A closer inspection
reveals that most of those ﬂows are from few devices. Their
divergent TCP behavior suggests that network equipment
(e.g. NAT or ﬁrewalls – see [10]) might be terminating noti-
ﬁcation connections abruptly. Considering the normal oper-
