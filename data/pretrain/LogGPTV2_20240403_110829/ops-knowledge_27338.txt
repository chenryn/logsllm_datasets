User: I have a task to check free space on particular directory on Windows. I figured out how to check for space of the drive. I was using ctypes module .
Could you please help me to figure out which module or function should I use to get similar information for directory on Windows?
Thanks
Assistant: This question doesn't make a lot of sense. Directories don't have "free space". As long as there is free space on the drive, you can use as much of it in a directory as you want.
