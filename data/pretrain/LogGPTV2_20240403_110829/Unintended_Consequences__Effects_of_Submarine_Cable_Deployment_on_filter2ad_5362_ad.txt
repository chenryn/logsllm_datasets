### Impact on AS Paths Lengths

From the BGP snapshots of August 1st–5th and October 1st–5th, 2018 (the months before and after the SACS launch), we extracted all AS paths through Angola Cables (AC) post-SACS (Set AFTER) and all AS paths between the source AS/destination prefix routed pre-SACS (Set BEFORE). We identified 2,115,761 unique AS paths that crossed AC in both snapshots. Since the number of observed AS paths differed in each set and the measurement windows were not strictly identical, we computed the average AS path length per source AS/destination prefix pair. The percentage of outliers, i.e., paths of lengths 10–13 (max), was approximately 1%.

We observed a shift in the AS path length distribution, with AS paths of lengths 2–7 generally increasing. This reflects the fact that more neighboring ASes preferred AS paths via AC after the SACS launch (Fig. 6). Interestingly, AC announced many paths to prefixes owned by multiple ASes 2–3 months before the SACS launch [22], perhaps preparing for the launch.

### 4.4 Validation with the ISP

In July 2019, we successfully contacted AC and were able to validate the inferred set of SACS link IPs and their respective locations. AC distinguished cases where the anomalous routes occurred outside their network, and tromboning occurred due to a lack of local peering, or where neighbor ASes were circuitously routing traffic toward AC after SACS. During our exchange, we took subsequent measurements that showed some AC neighbors had modified their routing configurations in ways that improved performance. Although AC did not validate cases of suboptimal routing within their network, most observed IP paths (from North America/Asia to Brazil or Europe/Asia to Angola) switched to more optimal paths after our conversation. AC also explained that internal link failures could account for the performance degradations. For example, if the MONET cable [3,59] (which AC’s router in Miami crosses to reach Fortaleza) becomes unavailable, the router may re-route traffic through London. They also noted that no customers had complained, so if there were any suboptimal routing, it was unlikely to be affecting any routes that carried significant traffic. However, we found that a few (≈4%) pairs used remarkably suboptimal paths as late as July 12, 2019, e.g., from Africa to prefixes in Angola served via Europe and Brazil or those from North America to Angola routed by AC via SACS and Lisbon. Finally, AC informed us that most traffic crossing SACS through AC goes from either South America to Angola or South Africa to Brazil, cases where our results show a pronounced decrease post-SACS (Sect. 4.1).

### 4.5 Potential Root Causes of Suboptimal Routing

We confirmed the occurrence of the routing suboptimalities described in this paper using two measurement platforms that revealed similar trends per region. Despite attempts to obtain insights from the ISP operating the cable (AC), we were unsuccessful. We conjecture that these suboptimalities derived from multiple causes (potentially concurrent): (i) misconfigurations of either the Internal or External Gateway Protocol (IGP/EGP) due to typos, errors, etc. [10]; (ii) slow IGP or EGP convergence [38]; (iii) some ASes routing packets through AC although it is not the optimal path to the destination; (iv) the persistent lack of peering among local ASes in Africa (despite ongoing efforts for more local interconnections) [30,32] and frequent use of default routes via international transit providers in developing regions.

### 5 Conclusion

It is generally assumed that the deployment of undersea cables between continents improves performance, at least for paths that cross a cable once it is deployed. We present a reproducible scientific method by third-parties to investigate the performance impact of a cable deployment, and we apply it to the case of the first South-Atlantic cable, connecting Brazil to Angola. Using traceroute and BGP data from global measurement platforms, and geolocation data and inferences, we found that this new cable initially reduced RTTs asymmetrically: the median RTT decrease from Africa to Brazil was roughly a third of that from South America to Angola (226 ms). More surprisingly, latency statistics to/from other regions of the world, including paths within Africa, increased post-activation due to circuitous IP paths that suboptimally crossed continents and the cable. We uncovered other potential sources of suboptimality, such as slow BGP route updates/lack of traffic engineering after a major event occurring in a neighboring AS, and problematic intra-domain routing within a single network. Our results suggest ways operators can avoid suboptimal routing post-activation of cables in the future: (i) informing BGP neighbors of the launch to allow time for appropriate changes in advance; (ii) ensuring optimal iBGP configurations post-activation, not only for pairs of ASes/countries expected to route most traffic through the cable, but also for served intra-regional and cross-regional traffic; and (iii) collaborating with measurement platforms or research institutions to verify path optimality. Our methodology is general enough to apply to other cable deployments, as well as cable failures, and contributes to a toolbox to support further scientific study of the global submarine cable network [8,9]. We share our code [31] to promote reproducibility and extension of our work.
