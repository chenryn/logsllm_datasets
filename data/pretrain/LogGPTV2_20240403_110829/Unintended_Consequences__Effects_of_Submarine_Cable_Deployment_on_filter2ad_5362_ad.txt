Impact on AS Paths Lengths
From Routeviews and RIPE RIS
BGP snapshots of Aug 1st–5th and
Oct 1st–5th, 2018 (the months before
and after SACS launch), we extracted
all AS paths
through AC post-
SACS (Set AFTER), and all AS
paths between the
source
AS/destination preﬁx routed pre-
SACS (Set BEFORE). We found
2,115,761 unique AS paths
that
crossed AC in both snapshots. Since

the number of observed AS paths diﬀered in each set and the measurements
windows are not strictly identical, we computed the average AS path length
per source AS/destination preﬁx pairs: the percentage of outliers i.e., paths of
lengths 10–13 (max) was ≈1%. We noticed the AS path length distribution
shifted, with AS paths of length 2–7 generally increasing, reﬂecting the fact
that more neighboring ASes preferred AS paths via AC after the SACS launch
(Fig. 6). Interestingly, AC apparently announced many paths to preﬁxes owned
by multiple ASes 2–3 months before the SACS launch [22], perhaps preparing
for the launch.
4.4 Validation with the ISP
In Jul 2019, we successfully contacted AC and were able to validate the inferred
set of SACS link IPs and their respective locations. AC distinguished cases where
the anomalous routes occurred outside their network, and tromboning occurred
due to lack of local peering, or where neighbor ASes were circuitously rout-
ing traﬃc toward AC after SACS. During our exchange with them, we took
subsequent measurements that showed some AC neighbors had modiﬁed their
routing conﬁgurations in ways that improved performance. Although AC did
not validate cases of suboptimal routing within their network, most observed IP
paths (from North America/Asia to Brazil or Europe/Asia to Angola) switched
to more optimal paths after our conversation. AC also explained that internal
link failures could account for the performance degradations. For example, if the
MONET cable [3,59] (which AC’s router in Miami crosses to reach Fortaleza)
becomes unavailable, the router may re-route traﬃc through London. They also
noted that no customers had complained, so if there were any suboptimal rout-
ing, it was unlikely to be aﬀecting any routes that carried any traﬃc. That said,
we found that a few (≈4%)  pairs used remarkably suboptimal paths as
late as Jul 12, 2019, e.g., from Africa to preﬁxes in Angola served via Europe
and Brazil or those from North America to Angola routed by AC via SACS and
Lisbon. Finally, AC informed us that most traﬃc crossing SACS through AC
goes from either South America to Angola or South Africa to Brazil, cases where
our results show a pronounced decrease post-SACS (Sect. 4.1).
4.5 Potential Root Causes of Suboptimal Routing
We conﬁrmed the occurrence of the routing suboptimalities described in this
paper using two measurements platforms that revealed similar trends per region.
We tried to obtain insights from the ISP operating the cable (AC) into poten-
tial causes, without success. We conjecture that these suboptimalities derived
from multiple causes (potentially concurrent): (i) misconﬁgurations of either
the Internal or External Gateway Protocol (IGP/EGP), due to typos, errors,
etc, [10] (ii) slow IGP or EGP convergence [38], (iii) some ASes routing pack-
ets through AC although it is not the optimal path to the destination, (iv) the
persistent lack of peering among local ASes in Africa (despite ongoing eﬀorts

for more local interconnections) [30,32] and frequent use of default routes via
international transit providers in developing regions.
5 Conclusion
It is generally assumed that deployment of undersea cables between continents
improves performance, at least for paths that cross a cable once it is deployed.
We present a reproducible scientiﬁc method by third-parties to investigate the
performance impact of a cable deployment, and we apply it to the case of the ﬁrst
South-Atlantic cable, connecting Brazil to Angola. We used traceroute and BGP
data from global measurement platforms, and geolocation data and inferences
to ﬁnd that this new cable had at least initially reduced RTTs asymmetrically:
the median RTT decrease from Africa to Brazil was roughly a third of that
from South America to Angola (226 ms). More surprising is that latency statis-
tics to/from other regions of the world, including paths within Africa, increased
post-activation due to circuitous IP paths that suboptimally crossed continents
and the cable. We uncovered other potential sources of suboptimality: slow BGP
route updates/lack of traﬃc engineering after a major event occurring in a neigh-
boring AS, and problematic intra-domain routing within a single network. Our
results suggest ways operators can avoid suboptimal routing post-activation of
cables in the future: (i) informing BGP neighbors of the launch to allow time
for appropriate changes in advance; (ii) ensuring optimal iBGP conﬁgurations
post-activation, not only for pairs of ASes/countries expected to route most
traﬃc through the cable, but also for served intra-regional and cross-regional
traﬃc; and (iii) collaborate with measurements platforms or research institu-
tions to verify path optimality. Our methodology is general enough to apply to
other cable deployments, as well as cable failures, and contributes to a toolbox
to support further scientiﬁc study of the global submarine cable network [8,9].
We share our code [31] to promote reproducibility and extension of our work.
