D. Laboratory Study Coordinator Instructions
(1) Invite the participant in. Leave the door to the room open.
Give the participant the consent form and audio release
to review and sign.
(2) Give participant the YubiKey 4 in its original packaging.
(3) Read the following paragraph to the participant:
During the course of this study, you will be using a security
tool called a YubiKey. It is in this shipping envelope.
Please, use the next Ô¨Åve minutes to learn more about the
YubiKey using the Internet.
(4) After Ô¨Åve minutes, stop the participant and read the
following 2 paragraphs:
If you have questions during the study, please ask them;
however we may not be able to answer them in order to
maintain the integrity of the study. Please comment on
things you Ô¨Ånd easy to use and things you Ô¨Ånd hard to
use. Let me know when you Ô¨Ånish each of the three tasks.
I may ask you to skip to the next section to make sure
there is time to complete all the tasks.
During this study, we ask you to use the accounts provided
on the worksheet, not your own personal accounts. Also
use our phone numbers. Ask us if you have questions.
(5) Give them their instruction sheet and indicate which order
to do the tasks as you write it down in your study notes.
(6) After 15 minutes on each task, cut them off. Thank them
and ask them to please go on to the next task. Do not
convey that they are incapable, but rather that our limited
time requires that we move on. If you are short on time,
divide the time evenly so they have 5-10 minutes at the end
of the hour to Ô¨Åll out the survey and get the compensation
form.
(7) Note how long each task took, mistakes made, and whether

E. Laboratory Study Instructions to Participants
Please complete the three parts of the study in the order
written below by your study coordinator. You will have 15
minutes to complete each task. You may Ô¨Ånd the task easy
or hard. Please keep the good and the bad experiences you
have in your mind so you can tell us about them in the Ô¨Ånal
questionnaire. The study coordinator is not allowed to help
you during these tasks.

(1) Welcome participant. Give them the consent form to sign.
(2) Verbally explain what will happen.
(3) Have participant choose a time for their Ô¨Ånal interview.
(4) Setup 2FA with Google (let them choose an authenticator
app or text). Demo login in an incognito window and on
a mobile device. Print backup codes.

them choose an
authenticator app or text). Demo login in an incognito
window and on a mobile device. Print backup codes.
(6) Setup YubiKey with Windows Hello (do not learn their
PIN). Demo login process.
(7) Warn them that changing settings could lock them out.
They do so at their own risk.
