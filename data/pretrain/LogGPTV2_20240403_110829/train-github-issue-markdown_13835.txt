It would be beneficial if the terminal application could support Microsoft's FancyZones PowerToy. This feature allows users to easily "shift" drag a window and have it snap into predefined zones on the desktop. Several other applications, such as Sticky Notes, already work seamlessly with this functionality. Integrating this capability into the terminal would enhance its usability and provide a more consistent user experience.
