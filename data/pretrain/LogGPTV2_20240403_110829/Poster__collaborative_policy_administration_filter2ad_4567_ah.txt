happens in multi lingual countries as Belgium and 
Switzerland. 
Several teachers face therefore a contradictory 
situation: on one hand they are quite willing to 
welcome the non Italian mother language children, 
encountering their specific education needs; on the 
other hand they experience a sense of betrayal with 
respect to Italian mother language students if they 
cannot guarantee a full achievement of the education 
goals as indicated by the education ministry.  In 2010, 
the previous education minister Mariastella Gelmini 
issued a law decree establishing the maximum 
18
acceptable number of foreign students per class, 
staring it at 30%. This measure is obviously incapable 
to provide a solution to the problem of how the public 
education service should be innovated in terms of 
objectives and teaching methods; nonetheless, this 
decision is a significant sign of the inability of our 
country to address the necessary changes in the 
organization of public services and in relation to 
social change. This contradictory situation is made 
more critical as the economical crisis reflects into a 
progressive reduction of the economical resources 
dedicated to public education. At first sight, we face 
with a difficult dilemma: on one hand teachers 
should ensure a high level of education inside 
the public system; on the other hand they have to 
adjust times, goals and methods to respond to the 
needs of students who do not posses those basic 
knowledge skills, that until a few years ago could be 
taken for granted.  Teachers are left alone in front 
of a challenging task. The renewal of the education 
methodologies is a very slow process, needing time 
and resources also in terms of experimentation 
opportunities. But students and families cannot wait 
since, for each child, education is a not replicable and 
non-reversible experience: what to do? In absence of 
convincing solutions, several families that can afford 
it, tend to switch toward the private education system, 
in search of schools that can guarantee didactical high 
standards; this is quite a negative process, increasing 
social divide and relenting the processing of social 
cohesion between new and native citizens. The search 
of a solution cannot be delegated to education 
scientist and education experts: it requires a cultural 
change of attitude as a preliminary condition to 
prepare the ground. Such a change requires a positive 
attitude toward innovation and the cooperation of all 
the actors involved in the process: teachers, families, 
politicians, and education experts. 
In other words, the real innovation can be stated in 
terms of a change of value and only consequently, can 
become effective in terms of practical goals and tasks.
In the case of the education, the change of perspective 
consists in the understanding that citizens with 
multilingual capabilities can play a very important role 
in our country. 
Italy is a relatively young country, being unified in the 
present form only since 1861. Since the unification, 
teachers activity was driven by the difficult goal of 
19
unify the nation from the cultural and linguistic points 
of view. After second world war, the goal of spreading 
official Italian language, opposed to deeply rooted 
dialects, was taken as priority and mandatory in the 
definition of education guidelines. Now, dialects 
have almost disappeared and our nation can be 
considered as quite homogeneous from the linguistic 
point of view. Now, children with good knowledge of 
foreign languages and traditions should conveniently 
considered as a resource: people capable to bridge 
our country with other nations around the world, so 
offering opportunities for exchange and cooperation in 
a more connected world [21]. 
4.4 Professional skills and social integration
Beside education, we investigated other domains also 
presenting similar dissonances.  As an instance, some 
significant phenomena concern the employment field. 
In Italy, new citizens are widely present in several 
fields of activity, but their presence is more relevant 
in blue-collar labors and medium to low skilled work, 
the field of work being small manufactures, household 
and agriculture (Ministero del lavoro e delle politiche 
sociali, 2012) [22]. The presence of new citizens 
is notably less diffused in some high skill fields as 
it is still rare to encounter a foreign origin doctor, 
teacher or accountant. In several cases, as previously 
mentioned, professional associations oppose 
bureaucracy barrier to people that obtained degrees 
in foreign countries to protect the privileges of the 
professional community members the employment 
rate being higher than in the case of the Italian 
citizens. In 2012, the percentage of employment was 
65.3 %, for EU citizens residing in Italy and 59.5 for 
non-European legal residents, compared to 43.0 % 
Italian citizens [23]. In some way, this closure attitude 
is supported by the Italian tendency to drive their 
choice in the search of professional contribution; 
mainly following tradition criteria instead of adopting 
merit based comparative analysis. As an example, a 
trained and experienced architect who obtained his/
her degree out of Italy needs examinations or even to 
join again university education programs before he 
or she can practice in Italy. This defensive closure is 
coherent with the dominant defensive attitude aimed 
at the conservation of privileges, very negative with 
respect to innovation and real merit dynamics.  
To translate these statements into practical actions, 
we conducted a one-semester project at the School of 
the Design at Politecnico di Milano. The participants 
were students of the first year of a master degree in 
communication design during the second semester of 
the 2011/2012 academic year.
The assignment required the development of 
collaborative services capable to give a contribution 
to the solution of a practical problem experienced by 
new citizens and, at the same time, to promote a better 
awareness of the unexploited potentialities of cultural 
diversity in our social environment.
In order to provide a better insight of the proposed 
issue, we invited as speakers, some representative 
members of the associations we cooperated with. 
Students were left free to choose the association to 
cooperate with and the specific domain of activity on 
which to focus the attention. 
5. PARTNERS AND STUDENT PROJECTS
In order to accommodate the multifaceted 
phenomenon of immigration and the problems that 
foreign citizens encounter upon their arrival in a new 
country the partners involved were associations and 
private agencies, which responded to different needs 
of the foreigners in Milan. 
Asnada school, is one of the few associations with a 
consolidated tradition of offering free Italian language 
classes to foreigners present in Milan and Rome. The 
school embraces an alternative approach to education, 
FIGURE1. Class and activities schedule
featuring an interdisciplinary range of activities, such 
as model making, acting and performing, singing and 
story telling. The school is open to both foreign and 
Italian citizens in mixed educational and creative 
activities [24].
Naga association is a non profit organization providing 
medical care and legal help to illegal immigrants 
in Milan. The association is not an alternative to 
institutional services, but comes to complete a services 
offered by the government and the municipality. The 
association is active in the Milan area and brings 
together more than 300 volunteers. In one year the 
association offers more than 1500 medical visits and 
legal advising sessions, and 800 persons are contacted 
by the Street Medical Unit service. [25]
Fondazione Intercultura is another non-profit 
organization whose mission is to promote the 
intercultural dialog and cultural exchanges for 
high school students in Italy. The association has as 
main aim to bring an increased awareness on the 
intercultural dialog, being active in the secondary 
school system. By organizing international exchange 
internships for high school students, the Intercultura 
association and foundation, enables an opening 
towards the positive perception of other cultures, both 
the above-mentioned associations, the students were 
introduced to the Intese project, an online platform 
developed by Metid center and dedicated to foreign 
on the Italian territory and overseas[26]. Along with 
students at Politecnico di Milano[27].

FIGURE 2. Game Mate Project
Some of the most interesting projects related to the free time of the immigrants away from home and 
acknowledged the lack of services that encouraged the outdoors and sports. GameMate (Bozzato, Castro, 
Leoni and Xia) is a project that proposes the organization of multicultural sport events, in this way enabling 
the creation of social ties between people from different cultures but sharing the same passion for sport.
FIGURE 3. Play with MI Project
Play with Mi (Peretti, Recalcati, Teruzzi) is an online and offline game aiming to invite the local residents of 
Milan to discover the multicultural events and interesting locations. Working touristic guide, the project is 
intended both for Italians and foreigners and proposes the collaborative creation of an alternative map that 
signals the presence of positive multicultural places.
As mentioned before, the introductory phase where the 
lectures and exercises concerned mainly the theoretic 
knowledge and were intended to sensibilize the 
students bringing them closer to the concept
of diversity, and helping them working with the 
partners. In result the projects tackled the issues 
discovered on the field research and were relevant 
to the specific problems of foreigners in Italy. The 
lectures were taught by a multidisciplinary group of 
teachers and lecturers whom balanced the content of 
the course and emphasized the hands on experience. 
An important factor was the field research and the 
21
encounter with the stories of the social workers and 
foreign residents, this motivating the students to 
develop their concepts. 
6. DISCUSSION – SPECIFICITY AND CONSTRAINTS IN 
THE ITALIAN CASE
As far as we know, the topic of social innovation with 
respect to multicultural societies is a new one for 
the service design community and for the P&C DESIS 
cluster. For this reason, this first experience should be 
FIGURE 4. ABC Diario Project  
ABCDiario (Students: Sassi, Verrengia, Zangrandi) is an online vocabulary that links the words in the Italian 
vocabulary with the stories of the participants. The website allows users to upload pictures and drawings 
to describe the significance of the letters and words in their language. The target users are the students at 
Asnada language school.
FIGURE 5. Extraskills Project  
Extraskills (Banchelli,  Biraghi, Gasparini, Tonelli) is an online platform that has the aim to emphasize the 
underused professional skills of the foreign citizens and putting them in direct contact with individuals 
and small businesses looking for part time collaborators. He service identified the gap between the real 
potential of the foreign professionals and the actual employment opportunities they have access to through 
traditional channels.
considered as a first investigation of a promising terrain. 
In our belief, the need of social innovation with 
respect to multicultural social dynamics is a P&C 
issue since in Italy the need of change is evident, and 
furthermore, it is also evident that the direction of the 
change are not yet clearly defined; the priority seems 
to be the activation of a dialog actively involving 
citizens – new and traditional –politicians, managers 
of public service institutions, experts (education, health 
care, job market experts) and, of course, designers.
The primary role of designers is the construction of 
meaningful experiences aimed to create an awareness 
of the state of being of our society, to enlighten 
the potentialities of a mixed and diversified social 
composition, and to provide positive experiences of 
intercultural dialog. 
It could be observed that we only provided quite 
vague and too ample project brief with respect to 
the usual education laboratory assignments. Probably 
that’s true, but we preferred to present the results 
of our research without attempting simplifications 
or complexity reduction.  It is a strong belief of the 
authors of this paper, that design should always try to 
embrace the real complexity of contexts while, from 
the education point of view, it is very important to 
22
guide the students toward some form of modeling of 
tangled contexts without suppressing contradictions 
and inconsistencies, exploring dynamic and changing 
phenomena. The projects developed as well as the 
class feedback showed several aspects that have 
to be taken in consideration when embarking in 
a class that emphasizes a highly debated social 
subject: 1. the course content involved students both 
professionally and emotionally, asking them to tackle 
a highly sensitive social issue with which they might 
not empathize. 2. being a multidisciplinary course 
that asked students to acquire technical skills the 
difficulty stays in balancing the importance of the 
service design and digital tools maintain the focus 
on the actual objective of the course. 3. The contact 
with the partners and the field studies have to be 
coordinated suggesting tools that could enable the 
active observation and conduct meaningful interviews. 
Altogether the class performed well in all activities, 
understanding the intention of the exercise and 
presenting projects that received a positive feedback 
from the partners. 
and the impact that such an issue can have on the 
design students. The course revealed, or rather verified 
the existence of several layers of perception of the 
reality. In this case the academic world that shapes the 
young generation was confronted with the entangled 
reality of the migration. One of the issues that came 
forward in the class was the acknowledgement of 
the regional migration, from south to north in Italy. 
This analogy helped students to come closer to the 
immigration phenomenon and find familiar meanings 
to it. One of the challenges of the teaching team was 
to avoid common places and stereotypes in explaining 
the pedagogical content and reviewing the student 
works. Having completed the course it is important to 
underline the complexity of the issues we approached 
and relevance of a more extended implementation 
of the intercultural dialog in the communication 
design. This field is still far from being thoroughly 
investigated and carries an important potential 
for creative expression in the field of service and 
interaction design.
In Facebook you can find some communities created 
by new citizens. One of them is named Yalla Italia. 
8.  CONCLUSION
In conclusion the entire process of preparing, 
conducting and reviewing the results of the course 
acquired it unfolded a double value: that of a research 
into a much discussed and controversial social issue, 
In some way we could summarize with these words, 
the results of the research activities we carried on 
to prepare the project phase with our students: Yalla 
Italia, Italy, wake up!

IMPLICATIONS FOR:
DESIGN PRACTICE
The course unveiled a still little explored niche of intervention for service design 
and in particular contributed to adding a design perspective to the intercultural 
dialog. It is very important to stress out the relevance of bringing the cultural issues 
in the realm of communication design practice in particular in the contemporary 
Italian context. If most of the times the design brief follows the market needs, in this 
case the exercise anticipated the change and the needs of a multicultural society.
DESIGN EDUCATION
Social issues have already a recognized place in the design curriculum, however 
the novelty of the approach stays in the direct involvement that a theme related to 
intercultural contact and dialog imposes. In this case rather than placing themselves 
outside the inquiry field, the students and teaching staff experienced the emotional 
involvement triggered by the close analysis of highly sensitive social issues 
experienced on everyday life.
