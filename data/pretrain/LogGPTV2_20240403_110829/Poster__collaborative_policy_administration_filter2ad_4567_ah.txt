### Multilingual Education in Italy: Challenges and Opportunities

In multilingual countries such as Belgium and Switzerland, educators often face a complex and contradictory situation. On one hand, they are committed to welcoming non-Italian-speaking students and addressing their specific educational needs. On the other hand, they feel a sense of betrayal towards Italian-speaking students if they cannot ensure that all educational goals, as set by the Ministry of Education, are fully met.

In 2010, the then Minister of Education, Mariastella Gelmini, issued a decree limiting the number of foreign students per class to 30%. While this measure was intended to manage the integration of non-Italian-speaking students, it failed to address the broader need for innovation in public education, including changes in objectives and teaching methods. This decision highlighted the country's inability to adapt its public services to social changes, a problem further exacerbated by the economic crisis, which has led to a reduction in resources allocated to public education.

This dilemma is particularly challenging for teachers, who must balance the need to provide high-quality education within the public system with the necessity to adjust their methods to meet the needs of students who may lack basic knowledge and skills that were once taken for granted. Teachers are often left to navigate this difficult task without adequate support or resources.

The process of renewing educational methodologies is slow and resource-intensive, requiring time and opportunities for experimentation. However, students and families cannot wait, as each child's education is a unique and irreplaceable experience. In the absence of effective solutions, many families who can afford it opt for private education, seeking schools that can maintain high educational standards. This trend, however, exacerbates social divides and hinders the integration of new and native citizens.

To address these challenges, a cultural shift is necessary, fostering a positive attitude towards innovation and collaboration among all stakeholders, including teachers, families, politicians, and education experts. The real innovation lies in a change of values, which can then be translated into practical goals and tasks. In the context of education, this means recognizing the value of multilingualism and viewing it as a resource rather than a barrier.

Italy, a relatively young nation unified only since 1861, has a history of striving to unify the country culturally and linguistically. Post-World War II, the spread of the official Italian language was prioritized over local dialects. Today, while dialects have largely disappeared, children with knowledge of foreign languages and traditions should be seen as assets. They can serve as bridges between Italy and other nations, facilitating exchange and cooperation in an increasingly interconnected world.

### Professional Skills and Social Integration

Beyond education, similar dissonances exist in other domains, particularly in the employment sector. In Italy, new citizens are more prevalent in blue-collar and low-skilled jobs, such as small manufacturing, household work, and agriculture. Their presence is less common in high-skilled professions like medicine, teaching, and accounting. Professional associations often impose bureaucratic barriers on individuals with foreign degrees, protecting the privileges of existing members. For example, a trained and experienced architect from outside Italy may need to undergo additional examinations or even re-enroll in university programs before practicing in Italy. This defensive stance is consistent with a broader tendency to prioritize tradition over merit-based criteria.

### Practical Actions and Projects

To translate these insights into action, we conducted a one-semester project at the School of Design at Politecnico di Milano. The participants were first-year master's students in communication design during the second semester of the 2011/2012 academic year. The assignment required the development of collaborative services to address practical problems faced by new citizens and promote awareness of the potential benefits of cultural diversity.

We invited representatives from various associations to provide insights into the issues. Students were free to choose the association and the specific area of focus. Some of the most interesting projects included:

- **GameMate**: A project proposing the organization of multicultural sports events to foster social ties.
- **Play with Mi**: An online and offline game encouraging Milan residents to discover multicultural events and locations.
- **ABCDiario**: An online vocabulary platform linking Italian words with personal stories, aimed at students at the Asnada language school.
- **Extraskills**: An online platform connecting foreign professionals with part-time job opportunities, highlighting underutilized skills.

### Discussion and Conclusion

The topic of social innovation in multicultural societies is relatively new for the service design community. This initial experience underscores the need for dialogue and collaboration among citizens, politicians, public service managers, and experts. Designers play a crucial role in creating meaningful experiences that raise awareness of the potential of a diverse society and facilitate intercultural dialogue.

The course revealed the complexity of the issues and the importance of a more extended implementation of intercultural dialogue in communication design. It also highlighted the emotional and professional involvement of students and the need to balance technical skills with the course's objectives.

In conclusion, this project not only addressed a controversial social issue but also anticipated the needs of a multicultural society, providing valuable insights for both design practice and education.
