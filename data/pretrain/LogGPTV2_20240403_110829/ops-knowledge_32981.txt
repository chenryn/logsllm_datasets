User: How to build a highly available web server cluster? Please provide a plan, including how to set up load balancing, how to synchronize resources, how to perform failover, etc.
Assistant: To build a highly available web server cluster, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Load balancing: In order to share the load pressure of each server, it is necessary to use a load balancer to dynamically distribute traffic to these servers. Commonly used load balancers include Nginx, HAProxy, F5, etc. 2. Resource synchronization: In order to ensure that all servers have the same content, it is necessary to synchronize the data on all servers. This can be achieved by using a distributed file system (such as GlusterFS) or a synchronization tool (such as rsync, scp, etc.). 3. Failover: When a server fails, requests need to be automatically transferred to other normal servers. This can be achieved in combination with load balancers and monitoring services (such as Nagios, Zabbix, etc.). Solution 1. Use Nginx as a load balancer, and set the list of back-end servers and their weights; 2. Use GlusterFS as a distributed file system to synchronize the /htdocs directory on each server; 3. Use Keepalived for high-speed Nginx Availability configuration, when the primary load balancer fails, automatically switch to the backup load balancer; 4. Use Nagios or Zabbix to monitor the health status of all servers, and automatically switch to other normal servers when a server fails. The above solutions can achieve high availability of Web server clusters, ensure that requests can be processed normally and avoid single points of failure.
