## Abstract
We deploy information-centric networks (ICN) to serve various applications, including content distribution, vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), home networks (homenet), and sensor networks. These applications require policy and context-based interactions between service producers and consumers. We conceptualize the ICN service layer as a contextualized information-centric bus (CIBUS), where diverse sets of service producers and consumers coexist. We develop a prototype that demonstrates several desirable features of ICN for homenets, such as contextual service publishing and subscription, zero-configuration node and service discovery, policy-based routing and forwarding with name-based firewall, and device-to-device communication. The prototype is applicable to both ad hoc and infrastructure settings and can handle diverse devices and services.

## 1. Introduction
Information-centric networks (ICN) [2] offer several features that make them suitable for diverse application environments, including home networks (homenet), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and Internet-of-things (IoT). These features include receiver-oriented communication, security policies at the service, device, and content levels, and naming entities according to application requirements. ICN is not only suitable for existing applications like content distribution but also for emerging applications such as sensor or ad hoc networks.

We envision ICN as a contextual information-centric bus (CIBUS) that spans diverse applications, enabling context-aware interactions among service producers and consumers. Such interactions require a service framework over ICN to discover, publish, and subscribe to resources, which vary based on the types of applications and contexts. This paper focuses on the CIBUS in the homenet scenario. Among our contributions, we design and develop lightweight name-based node and service discovery protocols that overlay ICN, allowing policy and context-based interactions between distributed service producers and consumers.

## 2. CIBUS-Based Home Network
### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
Figure 1(a) shows a high-level view of an ICN-based homenet architecture. ICN supports primitives such as request name-based services and content, name-based routing, in-network content caching, multi-homing, and multi-path routing. We propose a service management layer that enables contextual auto-node and service discovery, and policy-based service publishing and subscription. The ICN-based homenet provides the following novel features:
1. **Name-Based Networking**: As a name-based networking architecture, ICN-based homenet requires no configuration for local communication among producers and consumers within and across router boundaries. However, service access over the Internet requires ISP support.
2. **Contextual Service Discovery**: The service management layer allows consumers to discover services based on their contexts. A home gateway learns services through the discovery process, exposes APIs to manage service policies, and composes rich new services.
3. **Versatile Communication Modes**: With its zero-configuration nature and support for various communication modes such as 1:M and M:1, ICN can be used in various situations, including sensor networks, achieving the objective of a single network layer protocol in homenets.
4. **Receiver-Oriented Communication**: Being receiver-oriented, ICN allows consumers to express contexts, and producers to generate appropriate responses, enabling contextual communication.
5. **Integrated Security**: ICN integrates security with data requests and responses, which can be bound at the service, device, or content level.

### 2.2 Prototype
The prototype setup is shown in Figure 1(b), where multiple internal routers (IRs) are connected to a home gateway (HGw), and each is deployed with CCNx [1]. The HGw connects to an ISP’s provider gateway (PGw). The IRs provide gateway support to connected resource-constrained sensors. The prototype demonstrates the following functionalities:
1. **Home-Wide Zero-Configuration**: Through name-based neighbor and service discovery protocols across router boundaries.
2. **Policy and Context-Based Routing and Forwarding**: At the HGw/IRs, where routing tables are set as a result of the service discovery protocol.
3. **Name-Based Firewall**: At the HGw, where flows are inspected based on service names rather than ports and IP addresses.
4. **Layer-2 Agnostic Operations**: Realizing end-to-end ICN operations over any L2 technology.

#### Zero-Configuration Discovery Protocol
We develop two name-based CCN protocols: the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and the Service Publishing and Discovery Protocol (SPDP). NDP aims for ad hoc and contextual association of devices, while SPDP allows efficient discovery of services over ICN. Further details on these protocols can be found in [3].

#### Policy-Based Routing
ICN-based homenet uses policy-based routing and forwarding, where service entries in the FIB of the CCN router are a result of service discovery requested by consuming applications. In the HGw, a name-based firewall is realized by extending CCNx’s FIB logic to subject incoming requests to policies associated with services. For example, if a service is marked for private access, i.e., valid only within the homenet scope, any interest from outside is dropped by the HGw.

#### Device-to-Device Communication
While demonstrating the applicability of ICN to different scenarios, our prototype supports location-based service publishing and social-aware device-to-device (D2D) interaction.

### 2.3 Demonstration Scenarios
#### Health Monitoring Service
In this scenario, a consumer discovers a health monitoring service through the HGw. The user then subscribes to this service. The interaction between the consumer and the service results in another service instantiation on the consumer device, making the health monitoring data accessible to the healthcare service provider. The consumer device service is published for public access.

#### Sensor Service
A set of wireless sensor motes generates data on temperature, light, and humidity. This data is made accessible through a sensor service. The service is proxied by the internal router (IR-1) as shown in Figure 1(b) and published for public access.

#### Trusted D2D Interaction
This application demonstrates ICN-based ad hoc trusted and social device-to-device interaction. Two devices discover each other and their services through the neighbor and service discovery protocols. Data access is restricted through group-ID-based access control, and data confidentiality is enforced using a group key.
