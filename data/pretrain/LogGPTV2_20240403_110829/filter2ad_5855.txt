ABSTRACT
We deploy information-centric networks (ICN) to serve sev-
eral applications including content distribution, vehicle-to-
vehicle communication (V2V), home networks (homenet),
and sensor networks. These applications require policy
and context-based interaction between service producers and
consumers. We visualize the ICN service layer as a contextu-
alized information-centric bus (CIBUS), over which diverse
sets of service producers and consumers co-exist. We de-
velop a prototype and demonstrate several desirable features
of ICN for homenets such as contextual service publishing
and subscription, zero-conﬁguration based node and service
discovery, policy based routing and forwarding with name-
based ﬁrewall, and device-to-device communication. Fur-
thermore the prototype is applicable to both ad hoc and
infrastructure settings, and can deal with diverse devices
and services.

communication, enforcing security policies at service, device,
and content levels, and naming entities according to appli-
cation requirements. These features make ICN suitable not
only for existing applications such as content distribution,
but also for emerging applications such as sensor or ad hoc
networks.
We envision ICN as a contextual information-centric bus
(CIBUS) spanning diverse applications, over which context-
aware interaction is enabled among service producers and
consumers. Such interaction requires service framework over
ICN to discover, publish, and subscribe resources, which dif-
fer with the types of applications and contexts. This paper
discusses CIBUS in homenet scenario. Among our contribu-
tions, we design and develop light-weight name-based node
and service discovery protocols overlaying ICN, which allows
policy and context based interaction between distributed
service producers and consumers.
2. CIBUS BASED HOME NETWORK
A high level view of ICN based homenet architecture is
shown in Figure 1(a). ICN supports primitives such as re-
quest name-based services and content, name-based routing,
in-network content caching, multi-homing and multi-path
routing. We propose a service management layer allow-
ing contextual auto-node and service discovery, and policy-
based service publishing and subscription. ICN-based home-
net provides the following novel features: (1) Being a name-
based networking architecture, ICN-based homenet requires
no conﬁguration for local communication among producers
and consumers, within and crossing router boundary, but
service access over Internet requires ISP support; (2) The
service management layer allows consumers to discover ser-
vices based on their contexts. A home gateway learns ser-
vices through the discovery process, expose APIs to manage
service policies and compose rich new services; (3) With its
conﬁguration-less nature and support for various communi-
cation modes such as 1:M and M:1, ICN can be used for
various situations including sensor networks, achieving the
objective of single network layer protocol in homenet; (4)
Being receiver-oriented, ICN allows consumers to express
contexts, and producers to generate appropriate responses,
therefore enabling contextual communication; (5) ICN inte-
grates security with data requests and responses, which can
be bound at service, device, or content level.
2.1 Prototype
The prototype setup is shown in Figure 1(b), where mul-
tiple internal routers (IRs) are rooted to a home gateway

(HGw), and each is deployed with CCNx [1]. The HGw
connects to an ISP’s provider gateway (PGw). The IRs
provide gateway support to connected resource-constrained
sensors. The prototype demonstrates the following func-
tionalities: (1) Home-wide zero-conﬁguration through name-
based neighbor and service discovery protocols across router
boundary; (2) Context and policy based routing and for-
warding at the HGw/IRs, where routing tables are set as
the result of the service discovery protocol; (3) Name-based
ﬁrewall at the HGw, where ﬂows are inspected based on ser-
vice names rather than ports and IP addresses; (4) Layer-2
agnostic operations realizing end-to-end ICN operations over
any L2 technology.
Zero-conﬁguration discovery protocol: We develop
two name-based CCN protocols, namely, neighbor discovery
protocol (NDP) and service publishing and discovery proto-
col (SPDP). The objective of NDP is ad hoc and contextual
association of devices, while SPDP allows eﬃcient discovery
of services over ICN. Further details on these protocols can
be found in [3].
ICN-based homenet uses policy
Policy-based routing:
based routing and forwarding, wherein service entries in the
FIB of the CCN router are a result of service discovery re-
quested by consuming applications. In the HGw, a name-
based ﬁrewall is realized by extending CCNx’s FIB logic to
subject incoming requests to policies associated with ser-
vices. For example, if a service is marked for private access,
i.e. valid only within the homenet scope, any interest from
outside is dropped by the HGw.
Device-to-device communication: While demonstrat-
ing the applicability of ICN towards diﬀerent scenarios, our
prototype supports location based service publishing and
social-aware device-to-device (D2D) interaction.
2.2 Demonstration Scenarios
Health monitoring service: In this scenario, a consumer
discovers a health monitoring service through the HGw. The
user then subscribes to this service. The interaction be-
tween the consumer and the service results in another ser-
vice instantiation on the consumer device, which makes the
health monitoring data accessible to the healthcare service
provider. The consumer device service is published for pub-
lic access.
Sensor service: A set of wireless sensor motes are de-
ployed which generate data of temperature, light, and hu-
midity. This data is made accessible through a sensor ser-
vice. The service is proxied by the internal router (IR-1) as
shown in Figure 1(b), and published for public access.
Trusted D2D interaction: This application demonstrates
ICN-based ad hoc trusted and social device-to-device inter-
action. Two devices discover each other and their services
through the neighbor and service discovery protocols. Data
access is restricted through group-ID based access control,
and data conﬁdentiality is enforced using a group key.
