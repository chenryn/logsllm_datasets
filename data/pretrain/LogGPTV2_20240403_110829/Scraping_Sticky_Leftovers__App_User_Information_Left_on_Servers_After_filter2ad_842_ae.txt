2 raters and 100% agreement. We checked both the app
and its corresponding website. An app was labeled as ADF
if it offered an account deletion button or link, either in
app or on the website. The ﬁrst two authors, PhD students,
performed several tasks independently: unpacked the apps and
analyzed their binaries, ran the tools, checked the app-server
communication, etc. Next, they met to cross-check the ﬁndings
– the ﬁndings were in agreement for all apps.
We conﬁrmed 209 apps with ADF. AccountDeletionAnalyzer
reported 241 ADF apps, over-reporting 32 apps (false pos-
itives) and under-reporting 23 apps (false negatives);
the
reasons for false positives and false negatives will be discussed
shortly. Table 10 shows that the precision is 86.7%, while the
recall is 90.1%; hence the F-measure is 88.4%.
These results allow us to conclude that AccountDeletionAna-
lyzer is effective.
For
false positives, we identiﬁed two major
reasons.
First, an app could provide deletion functionality for ac-
counts other than the user account. An example is Busi-
ness Calendar (com.appgenix.bizcal, 5M+ installs). The app
supports deleting birthday accounts, which does not delete
the user account. Second,
the dele-
tion button as invisible. For example, Bleacher Report Live
(com.bleacherreport.android.teamstream, 1M+ installs) contains an
the app might set
AD string, button, and listener, but its setupUI() method calls
this .mDeleteButton. setVisibility (8) where setVisibility (8) renders
the AD button invisible.
For false negatives, we identiﬁed three reasons. First, pre-
NLP pattern matching might fail to ﬁnd potential AD strings.
For example, our analysis could not ﬁnd the AD strings in the
Goodreads book reviewing app (com.goodreads, 10M+ installs).
Second, image conversion might fail to convert image AD
text into plain text. For example, Guides by Lonely Planet
(com.lonelyplanet.guides, 1M+ installs) has ADF but our tool
failed to convert its AD string images into text. Third, if
the underlying static analyzer misses intra- or inter-procedural
ﬂows, e.g., due to reﬂection, our interprocedural analysis in
turn will miss action listeners.
Among the 437 non-ADF (i.e., true negative) apps, 384 have
more than 1M installs, which again is a source of concern.
Table 11 shows those 16 non-ADF apps with more than 10M
installs. Neither the apps nor their websites offer account
deletion, hence users cannot remove their account from the
backend server. The Bleacher Report Live app provides an
unusual option,
to allow the app to sell user’s personal
information; the option is ON by default. However, the app
does not allow the user to delete the account.
The column “#Non-ADF apps” in Table 7 shows the number
of non-ADF apps in each LAI category. Email, password,
location and phone number are the most frequent information
collected by non-ADF apps – virtually all non-ADF apps
collect such information.

9.2.3. Retention Period Analyzer. Ground Truth was ob-
tained via manual analysis on the 209 apps with ADF. We
conﬁrmed 34 apps with retention period. RetentionPeriodAna-
lyzer over-reported 3 apps and under-reported 3 apps, hence
(Table 12) precision was 91.9%, recall was 91.9%, and the
F-measure was 91.9%. The major reason for false negatives
is that the account deletion button and retention period string
appear in separate locations: one on the app website, the other
in the APK ﬁle. The major reason for false positives was that
the retention period strings did appear in XML ﬁles but were
not displayed on app screens, e.g., the app Fever.
Retention period statistics and clusters. Table 13 shows
that the maximum, minimum, average and median retention
periods were 5 years, 30 minutes, 117.85 days, and 30 days
respectively. The retention periods naturally fell into clusters

9.2.4. Leftover Account Cleaner. To study LeftoverAccount-
Cleaner effectiveness, we created 10 test accounts on Google
Play Store with varying numbers of uninstalled apps, then in-
voked the LeftoverAccountCleaner to perform automatic cleaning.
An app is considered as cleaned up successfully if LeftoverAc-
countCleaner can automatically ﬁnd and click the app’s ADF
button (or link) to delete the user account.
Table 15 shows our experimental results for the 10 users.
The test users have uninstalled between 5 and 49 apps; these
uninstalled apps are associated with leftover accounts which
need to be cleaned up. We report the number of apps cleaned
up successfully and unsuccessfully per each user. The experi-
ment results show that LeftoverAccountCleaner failed to cleanup
12.65% of apps. Cleanup failed due to random advertising
and CAPTCHA pop-ups. For example, during the screen auto-
navigation stage, app Life360 (com.life360.android.safetymapd)
shows a promotion ad pop-up; the ad asks users to upgrade
to premium features. App com.discord has a CAPTCHA screen
pop-up.
Note that, in the absence of LeftoverAccountCleaner, users
would have to manually perform account cleanup, e.g., by
reinstalling the app or going to the app’s website for up to 49
apps, which is a substantial effort.
9.3. Efﬁciency
We now discuss the efﬁciency results for each tool. Statistics
are shown in Table 16.
LeftoverAccountAnalyzer. The analyzer’s median time was
time-consuming phase was the
162.68 seconds. The most
reinstall phase, which can take 30–60 seconds per app.
AccountDeletionAnalyzer. The median analysis
time was
275.79 seconds per app and 3.03 seconds per website, re-
spectively. The maximum time (16,407 seconds) was due to a
lengthy Tesseract image-to-text conversion.
RetentionPeriodAnalyzer. The median analysis
time was
259.03 seconds per mobile app and 2.96 seconds per website,
respectively. The maximum time (10,311.26 seconds) was due
to a lengthy Tesseract image-to-text conversion.
LeftoverAccountCleaner. The cleaning process’ duration de-
pends on (1) how many screens each app requires to navigate
before reaching the account deletion button, and (2) how
