In BinaryFilesResponse.php's "prepare" method, the partial response is created
only if no "If-Range" request header found, or if it matches the response's
ETag.  
Default behavior of this response is to not send ETag header, but Last-
Modified, so we have no browser cache.  
As per the spec, "If-Range" request header value may also be compared with the
response's Last-Modified time.  
And that would be usefull :-)
