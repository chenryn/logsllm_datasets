At the moment in my code exist method with such signature:
    @RequestMapping(value = "/projects/{filter}/{order}-{direction}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String filteredProjectListing(@PathVariable("filter") String filter, @PathVariable("order") String order,
                @PathVariable("direction") String direction, ModelMap model) {
     ...
    }
order is String variable containing ognl-like expresssion ie. "raging.result"
(which I later use for BeanComparator) but this mapping is in version RC3 is
not found, which is different behaviour from RC2 where there is no such
problem.
Log message with example of given fault result is:
    2009-12-01 16:38:02,459 WARN [org.springframework.web.servlet.PageNotFound] - 
There is no problem with handling path which doesn't contain more '.' (dot)
characters, so this can probably help you with analysis of the problem.
