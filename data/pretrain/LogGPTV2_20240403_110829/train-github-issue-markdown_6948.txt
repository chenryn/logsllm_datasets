When attempting to access the URL `https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/README.rst?raw=true`, the request fails. However, accessing the redirected URL `https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/raw/master/README.rst` succeeds. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the redirect is being handled.

I am not entirely certain if this is a problem with the `requests` library, as it could also be due to server-side behavior. However, the same URL works correctly in both a web browser and with tools like `curl` and `wget`.

Here are the details of my environment and the error trace:

This error indicates that there is an issue with the connection being aborted during the handling of the redirect.
