Trying to get
https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/README.rst?raw=true
fails. Getting https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/raw/master/README.rst
(which the former redirects to) succeeds, so I think this has something to do
with the handling the redirect.
I'm not 100% sure this is an issue with requests (it's possible the server is
misbehaving), but the same URL does work in the browser and in curl and wget.
