4. Authentication probability
4.1. Asymptotic authentication probability
In 
this  subsection,  we  derive 
the  asymptotic
authentication  probability  of  SAIDA  in  a  bursty  loss
environment. We define the authentication probability as
Pr(
iP   represents  the
i-th packet—this definition was adopted from [10]. Using
this definition, the authentication probability for a stream
(consisting of multiple blocks) would be calculated by

where S denotes the number of blocks within the stream.
Note that this is different from the verification probability
defined  in  Subsection  2.1.  Verification  probability  is  the
number of verifiable packets of the stream divided by the
total  number  of  received  packets  of  the  stream.  For
example, suppose that two blocks of authenticated packets
were  transmitted.  In  the  first  block,  five  packets  were
received but only two were verified. In the second block,
four  packets  were  received  but  only  two  were  verified.
The  resulting  authentication  probability  and  verification
probability are 
 respectively.

The authentication probability is directly affected by
the loss model used in the analysis. In [19], it was shown
that the 2-state Markov chain can accurately model bursty
loss  patterns  in  certain  cases,  and  hence  we  adopt  this
model for our analysis. Throughout the paper, we denote
this loss model as the 2-state Markov Chain (2-MC) loss
model. It is defined as follows:
2-MC  loss  model:  The  loss  process  is  modeled  as  a
discrete-time  Markov  chain  with  two  states—0  and  1—
representing no loss and loss, respectively. It is defined by
the  four  transition  probabilities  (i.e., 
  and
