### Comparative Analysis with Existing Techniques

The approach we propose can detect pre-existing botnets, unlike some other methods that require external assistance and lack stored traffic data. For instance, Illiofotou et al. [36, 35] utilize the dynamic nature of traffic graphs to classify network flows for detecting P2P networks. Their method employs both static (spatial) and dynamic (temporal) metrics at the node and edge levels, along with the size of the largest connected component as a graph-level metric. In contrast, our scheme is grounded in first principles, specifically the search for expanders, and leverages the full extent of spatial relationships, including joint degree distribution and joint-joint degree distribution, to identify P2P graphs.

### Limitations of Current Botnet Detection Techniques

Among the various botnet detection and mitigation techniques, many are ad-hoc and only apply to specific scenarios, such as centralized botnets like IRC, HTTP, and FTP. However, recent studies [28] indicate a shift towards the P2P model. Techniques that do address P2P botnets often rely on specific details about control traffic ports, network behavior, and reverse engineering of botnet protocols, which limits their applicability. Generic schemes like BotMiner [29] and TAMD [76], which use behavior-based clustering, are more versatile but require extensive flow information, raising legal and privacy concerns. It is also crucial to consider potential defenses that botmasters might employ, the cost of these defenses, and their impact on detection efficiency. Shear and Nicol [64, 54] describe methods to mask the statistical characteristics of real traffic by embedding it in synthetic, encrypted cover traffic. Such schemes require minimal changes to existing botnet architectures but can effectively counteract detection methods that depend on packet-level statistics, including BotMiner and TAMD.

### Conclusion

The ability to localize structured communication graphs within network traffic represents a significant step forward in identifying bots or traffic that violates network policy. As a first step in this direction, we have proposed BotGrep, an inference algorithm that identifies botnet hosts and links within network traffic traces. BotGrep works by searching for structured topologies and separating them from the background communication graph. We provide an architecture for deploying BotGrep in a network, along with a privacy-preserving extension to facilitate cross-network deployment. While our techniques do not achieve perfect accuracy, they maintain a low enough false positive rate to be highly useful, especially when combined with complementary techniques. Future work could focus on improving performance by leveraging temporal information to assist in separating the botnet graph. Additionally, distinguishing other peer-to-peer structures from general Internet background traffic, perhaps by observing more fine-grained communication patterns, could be beneficial. Finally, addressing the challenging problem of botnet response, such as partitioning the botnet based on its inferred topology, remains an important area for future research.
