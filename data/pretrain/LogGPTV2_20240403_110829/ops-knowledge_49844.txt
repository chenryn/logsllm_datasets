User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Let's Encrypt certificate not recognized by Nginx I successfully created some LE SSL certs, using this guide.

However, when I updated my nginx config to use the certs and redirect all port 80 traffic to 443. http successfully redirects to https, the site doesn't load. The browser detects that I have a valid cert, but says I do not have a secure connection. This is what I have in my /var/log/nginx/error.log:

2016/03/08 00:11:49 [error] 7301#0: *14 no "ssl_certificate" is defined in server listening on SSL port while SSL handshaking, client: 55.555.55.555, server: 0.0.0.0:443


The error says I have no SSL cert defined, despite the fact that I do. This is my config:

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name cooldomain.pizza www.cooldomain.pizza
  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/cooldomain.pizza/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/cooldomain.pizza/privkey.pem;

  ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';

  root /home/ubuntu/www/cooldomain-pizza;
  index index.php index.html index.htm;

  server_name cooldomain.pizza www.cooldomain.pizza;
  charset utf-8;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    # Uncomment to enable naxsi on this location
    # include /etc/nginx/naxsi.rules
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    include fastcgi_params;
  }
}


I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 with Nginx 1.4.6.

Any idea what is happening? I had to roll back the SSL version of the site and go back to being port-80-only.

Assistant: You appear to be missing a semicolon at the end of the server_name directive. I suspect this is causing the following line to be interpreted as part of the server_name directive rather than as a new directive.
