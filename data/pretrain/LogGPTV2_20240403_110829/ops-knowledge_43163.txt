User: I'm playing around with python and have written an application that generates a lot of text which it prints to the stdout.(I run the application in a console(bash) and don't want to use a GUI or external tool) 
The process takes up a lot of time and I can calculate how much it has already finished..
The output of the application is always piped from the running script..
I would like to present a notification to the user from time to time of how much of the text generation is done.. (I can't print to stdout because it is redirected to some other process..)
Is there some way to do this?
Your suggestions are much appreciated!
Assistant: You can generate additional file somewhere where you record status of your application. On UNIX platforms users can tail it in another console. Sending e-mails with status  is another option.
