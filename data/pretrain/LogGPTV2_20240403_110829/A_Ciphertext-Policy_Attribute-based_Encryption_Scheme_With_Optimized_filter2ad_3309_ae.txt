the solution of [18]. Our scheme is more eﬃcient than [18]
when the size of the boolean formula is bigger than the
number of clauses, otherwise it has the same eﬃciency. Our
construction also achieves fast decryption time, hence it is
already an improvement to [18] which was one of the best
constructions for CP-ABE supporting ﬁne grained policies.
On top of that, our scheme can be extended to allow the user
to keep only part of the encryption and decryption material
secret, which lends itself well to the case where the user has
limited storage and computation capabilities or when the
client is taking advantage of a cloud. Finally we proposed a
support for multiple non-colluding authorities to eﬀectively
mitigate the problem of key-escrow by the authority that
extracts the key.

APPENDIX
A. MULTI-AUTHORITY CP - ABE
Formally, a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme consists of
four probabilistic algorithms.
Setup(1λ,B, θ): The setup algorithm takes the security pa-
rameter λ, the description of the attributes’ universe
B, and the maximum number of authorities in the sys-
It generates θ partial master key
tem θ as inputs.
MSK1, . . . , MSKθ, as well as the global public parame-
ters param of the system.
Extract(u,B(u), MSKi, param): Takes as input a user u and
his set of attributes B(u), as well as the public parame-
ters param and a partial master key MSKi (1 ≤ i ≤ θ).
It outputs the partial user’s private key di
u. This algo-
rithm is run θ times by θ diﬀerent authorities. Finally,
the full secret key of user is computed from θ partial
user’s private key.
Encrypt(M, A, param): Takes as input a message M, an
access policy A over the universe of attributes and the
global public parameters param. It outputs the cipher-
text ct along with a description of the access policy
A.
Decrypt(ct, du, param): Takes as input the ciphertext ct,
the private key du of user u, together with the global
public parameters param. It outputs the message M if
and only if B(u) satisﬁes A. Otherwise, it outputs ⊥.
Security Model.
We consider two types of adversary for a multi-authority
CP-ABE scheme, named Type I adversary A1 (related to
Game I below) and Type II adversary A2 (related to Game
II below).
In fact, A1 represents a third party adversary against the
multi-authority CP-ABE scheme. Then, A1 does not know
any partial master secret key. On contrary, the adversary
A2 represents a curious authority who generates partial se-
cret key of users. Then, besides knowing other information
as A1 does A2 also knows additionally at most θ − 1 partial
master secret keys.
It is straightforward to realize that a multi-authority CP-
ABE scheme is secure if it resists Type II adversary.
Game I: it is almost the same as the deﬁnition of security
model in the section 2.1.
Game II: it is also almost the same as the deﬁnition of
security model in the section 2.1, except that the simulator
has to provide at most θ − 1 partial master keys for the
adversary.
B. CONVERSION FROM A BOOLEAN FOR-
MULA TO A CORRESPONDING LSSS
MATRIX
In this section, we recall from [20] the algorithm to con-
vert from a boolean formula to a corresponding LSSS ma-
trix. The algorithm works as follows.
We ﬁrst consider the boolean formula as an access tree,
where interior nodes are AND and OR gates and the leaf
nodes correspond to attributes. We will use (1, 0, . . . , 0)
as the sharing vector for the LSSS matrix. We begin by
labeling the root node of the tree with the vector (1) (a
vector of length 1). We then go down the levels of the tree,
labeling each node with a vector determined by the vector
assigned to its parent node. We maintain a global counter
variable c which is initialized to 1.
If the parent node is an OR gate labeled by the vector v,
then we also label its children by v (and the value of c stays
the same). If the parent node is an AND gate labeled by
the vector v, we pad v with 0’s at the end (if necessary) to
make it of length c. Then we label one of its children with
the vector v|1 (where | denotes concatenation) and the other
with the vector (0, . . . , 0)| − 1, where (0, . . . , 0) denotes the
zero vector of length c. Note that these two vectors sum to
v|0. We now increment the value of c by 1. Once we have
ﬁnished labeling the entire tree, the vectors labeling the leaf
nodes form the rows of the LSSS matrix. If these vectors
have diﬀerent lengths, we pad the shorter ones with 0’s at
the end to arrive at vectors of the same length.
