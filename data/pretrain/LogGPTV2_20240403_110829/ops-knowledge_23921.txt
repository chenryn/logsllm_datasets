User: What is a CI/CD pipeline? Please explain what each pipeline stage means.
Assistant: CI/CD pipeline is an automated software development process, including continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD) and continuous deployment (CD), which saves the team's time and energy by automating the development, testing, and deployment processes , while ensuring the high quality of the software. Each pipeline trigger is triggered by a code change, merge request, or other event. CI stage: continuous integration stage, which mainly solves the problem of code coexistence in the team development process, and continuously and automatically compiles, tests and summarizes the code of each developer, so that the code can be changed faster and more accurately. The overall impact of the system, thus quickly saving time for team development and improving product quality. CD phase: continuous delivery phase, after the code has passed the continuous integration test, it should be deployed to the pre-production [forecast product] intermediate environment, verify the effect, and then release it to the production environment, and push the code to the production environment as soon as possible. Continuous delivery is an automated process from software development to production. CD phase: Continuous deployment phase, after continuous testing, the continuous deployment process releases the available version to the production environment. This stage is generally highly automated, and all processes are spontaneous in the production environment without manual intervention, thereby ensuring quality and achieving high efficiency.
