Not sure if this is a bug or there is simply a discrepancy between NumPy and
Python. Though this is what I am seeing in some (not all) cases. FYI, similar
(but not the exact same) behavior for `np.float128`.
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.float64(0.47140452079103168)
    >>> round(a, 4)
    0.47139999999999999
    >>> a = np.float64(0.47140452079103168)
    >>> round(float(a), 4)
    0.4714
    >>> a = 0.47140452079103168
    >>> round(a, 4)
    0.4714
