Figure 8: Throughput improvement: Throughput perfor-
mance of k-multihoming relative to k-overlays for various cities
is shown in (a). The table in (b) shows the fraction of measure-
ments on which k-overlay routing selected an indirect end-to-
end path, for the case of k = 3.
Throughput performance. Figure 8(a) shows the throughput per-
formance of k-multihoming relative to k-overlays using the pes-
simistic throughput estimation function. From this ﬁgure, we see
that multihoming achieves throughput performance within 1–10%
of overlays, for k = 3. The performance improves up to k = 3
or k = 4.
In all the cities, the throughput performance of 4-
multihoming is within 3% of overlay routing. In Figure 8(b), we
also show the fraction of measurements where an indirect 3-overlay
path offers better performance than the direct 3-multihoming path,
for the pessimistic throughput estimate. On average, this fraction
is about 8%. Notice that this is again lower than the corresponding
percentage for 1-overlays from Table 1 ((cid:25) 17%).
Summary. When employed in conjunction with multihoming, over-
lay routing offers marginal beneﬁts over employing multihoming
alone. For example, multiple ISPs allows overlay routing to achieve
only a 5–15% RTT improvement over multihoming route control
(for k = 3), and 1–10% improvement in throughput. In addition,
k-overlay routing selects a larger fraction of direct BGP-based end-
to-end paths, compared to 1-overlay routing.
5.7 Unrolling the Averages
So far, we presented averages of the performance differences for
various forms of overlay routing and multihoming route control. In
this section, focusing on 3-overlays and 3-multihoming, we present
x
 50ms), the
points are clustered closer to the y = 0 line, suggesting that large
improvements are due primarily to routing around congestion. We
also found, however, that 72% of all the points lie above the y =
x=2 line. These are closer to the y = x line than y = 0, indicating
that a majority of the round-trip improvements do arise from a re-
duction in propagation delay. In contrast, Savage et al. [25] observe
that both avoiding congestion and the ability to ﬁnd shorter paths
are equally responsible for the overall improvements from overlay
routing. The difference in our observations from those in [25] could
be due to the fact that Internet paths are better provisioned and less
congested today than 3-4 years ago. However, they are sometimes
circuitous, contributing to inﬂation in end-to-end paths [28].
