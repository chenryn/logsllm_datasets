User: I want to run multiple instances of APScheduler pointing to one common persistent job DB. Is it possible to run in that way?? I also mean that the jobs in the DB get shared among the Scheduler instances and at a point there is only one instance executing a scheduled job.
Assistant: This looks like an old question but I'll answer it anyway. No, it's not (yet) possible to run APScheduler in that manner yet due to lack of a synchronization/locking mechanism to that end.
