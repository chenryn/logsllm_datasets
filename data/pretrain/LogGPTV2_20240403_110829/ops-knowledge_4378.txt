User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why is this China IP hitting my web site? I have a web site that uses a couple hundred domain aliases, including franchise-dallas.info, franchise-delaware.info, and detroitfranchise.info (see more below).

I have been getting ten to twenty hits per day via Google AdWords PPC.  I set up a log file so that I could see the variables in the URL.  

I was surprised to see that the page is getting hit about once per minute. I looked up the IPs and they are all in China.

My site has ZERO content that would be of use to anyone outside the U.S.A.

Can you tell me why my site would be getting this type of hit? Is this normal? Is this a bot?

Assistant: Welcome to hosting a website on its own IP address. You can put a host on a public IP nowadays and chances are you'll get hit with a scan before the end of the day, probably sooner. Often times the source is just scanning up and down the IP ranges looking for running web, mail or shell servers to attack. They may not even know your website's proper domain name.

Updating my answer since I notice its now the top site that comes up when you ask this question and similarly worded ones. So much has happened in this field since 2011, when I originally answered your question.

China has a sophisticated state funded cyberattack force that is constantly scanning most of the Internet on a daily basis looking for vulnerable website software and services. They will do repeat scans so you'll see the same IPs over and over again in your logs and site stats. This has been going on since at least as far back as the late 1990s, but in recent years has increased significantly.

Chances are your site is going to be hit by other countries and from inside the US as well by adversaries also looking for vulnerable sites, but right now China is by far the largest source of these types of attacks. As always, you should make sure your website's software is kept up to date because if you are running any vulnerable version of popular software you can bet it will be exploited quickly.
