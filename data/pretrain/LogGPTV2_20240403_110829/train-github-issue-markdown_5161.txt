When `xcode-select` is set to point to Xcode 8:

```sh
$ xcode-select -p
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

I encounter the following compilation error when running `build_all_ios.sh` on macOS Sierra:

```sh
checking whether we are cross compiling... 
configure: error: in `/Users/serkan/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/makefile/downloads/protobuf':
configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.
If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.
See `config.log' for more details.
```

I am unsure if this issue is related to Xcode 8 or to code signing on macOS Sierra.
