When you use `Link` with an accompanying ``, the proper component's template appears in the
outlet. The issue is when the user refreshes (on the proper URL extension,
i.e., `localhost:8080/foo`), no templates are loaded (including the original
app's template), leaving the page blank. As far as I can tell, what's
happening is that as that URL only is marked to use the template of `foo`, so
there is no outlet for it to show up in. There is the chance I am doing this
wrong, but everything else is working properly.
