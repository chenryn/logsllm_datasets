User: When tracing(using sys.settrace) python .egg execution by Python 2.7 interpreter frame.f_code.co_filename    instead of <path-to-egg>/<path-inside-egg> eqauls to something like build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/<path-inside-egg>
Is it a bug? And how to reveal real path to egg?
In Python 2.6 and Python 3 everything works as expected.
Assistant: No, that is not a bug. Eggs, when being created, have their bytecode compiled in a build/bdist.<platform>/egg/ path, and you see that reflected in the co_filename variable. The bdist stands for binary distribution.
