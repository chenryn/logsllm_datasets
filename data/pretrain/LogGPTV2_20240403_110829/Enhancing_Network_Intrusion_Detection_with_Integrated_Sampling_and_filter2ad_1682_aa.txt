Preface
On behalf of the Program Committee, it is our pleasure to present the proceed-
ings of the 9th Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID
2006), which took place in Hamburg, Germany, on September 20-22, 2006.
As every year since 1998, the symposium brought together leading researchers
and practitioners from academia, government and industry to discuss intrusion
detection research and practice. We had sessions on anomaly and speciﬁcation-
based detection, network-based intrusion detection, attacks against intrusion
detection systems, IDS evaluation and malware analysis.
The RAID 2005 Program Committee received 93 paper submissions from
all over the world, including 15 papers submitted as “Big Challenge, Big Idea”
papers. All the submissions were carefully reviewed by several members of the
Program Committee and evaluated on the basis of scientiﬁc novelty, importance
to the ﬁeld, and technical quality. Final selection took place at the Program
Committee meeting held on June 1st and 2nd in Z¨urich, Switzerland. Sixteen
papers were selected for presentation and publication in the conference pro-
ceedings, placing RAID among the most competitive conferences in the area of
computer security.
This year we announced “Big Challenge, Big Idea” as a theme. We encouraged
submissions in a separate category, looking for papers that described fundamen-
tal problems that have not yet been tackled by intrusion detection research, or
bold, risky or controversial ideas for potential research or solutions.
A successful symposium is the result of the joint eﬀort of many people. In
particular, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers, whether
accepted or not. We also thank the Program Committee members and additional
reviewers for their hard work in evaluating the submissions. In addition, we want
to thank the General Chair, Dieter Gollmann, for handling the conference ar-
rangements, Robert Cunningham for publicizing the conference, James Riordan
for putting together the conference proceedings, Klaus-Peter Kossakowski for
ﬁnding sponsor support, and Jan Meier for maintaining the conference Web
site. Finally, we extend our thanks to the Northwest Security Institute (NSWI)
and Cisco Systems for their sponsorship of student scholarships.
