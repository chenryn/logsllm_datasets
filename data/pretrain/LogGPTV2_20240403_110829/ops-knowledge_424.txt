I am experiencing an issue with Django on Google App Engine. I have designed the HTML templates for my web application and successfully imported them into Django using the Django template system.

The problem arises when I try to integrate Google AdSense. When I open the HTML version of my pages in a browser, the AdSense banners display correctly. However, when I load the same pages through Django, the banners do not appear. Additionally, I created a simple HTML template containing only the AdSense script. When I attempt to load this template via Django, it returns a completely blank (white) page, with no banner or any other content displayed.

What can I do to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

Google AdSense relies on JavaScript, so if your Django application is not rendering the expected output, you should check the `HttpResponse` and how you are generating the template. It seems like you may need to specify the location of the template file in your `settings.py`.

To address this, you might want to add the following code to your `settings.py`:

```python
import os
ROOT_PATH = os.path.dirname(__file__)
TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(ROOT_PATH, 'templates'),
)
```

Ensure that your Django templates are stored in a sub-directory called `templates` within your project directory.

Additionally, you can try a process of elimination to identify the problem:
- Comment out any JavaScript in your template and see if the template renders correctly without it.
- If the template renders correctly without the JavaScript, then the issue is likely with the JavaScript itself or how it's being included in the template.

If the template still doesn't render, double-check the following:
- Ensure that the template files are correctly named and placed in the `templates` directory.
- Verify that your view is correctly rendering the template and returning the `HttpResponse`.
- Check for any errors in the browser's developer console, as they may provide more information about why the AdSense script is not executing.
