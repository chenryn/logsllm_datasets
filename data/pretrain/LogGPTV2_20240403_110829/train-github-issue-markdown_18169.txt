Pls. provide [GitHub address] to reproduce this issue.
### the content of pdf documents.
What do you expected from the above stepsï¼Ÿ
### null, and exceptions below.
What is actually happen?
### In fact, the first request throw a SocketTimeoutException, see below, but
latter requests reponse correctly. So I guess that is because of initializaton
probleam. _Then I find when I set timeout=2000 on ,
everything works rightly._ It's very confusing to me. According to exceptions
thrown by provider, that is, the consumer doesn't send input stream correcly,
and it throws a timeout exception immediately, so provider cannot get input
stream, it throws a org.apache.tika.exception.ZeroByteFileException.
If there is an exception, please attach the exception trace:
