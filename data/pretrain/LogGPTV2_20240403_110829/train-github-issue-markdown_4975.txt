The API for testing with pointer events is structured as follows:

```java
Point start = new Point(...);
Point end = new Point(...);
tester.dispatchEvent(pointer.down(start), start);
tester.pump();
tester.dispatchEvent(pointer.move(end), start);
tester.pump();
tester.dispatchEvent(pointer.up(), start);
tester.pump();
```

One notable aspect of this API is that you must pass the starting point (`start`) for all events, even after the pointer has been moved. This requirement can be somewhat counterintuitive, as it might not align with the expected behavior in a real user interaction scenario.
