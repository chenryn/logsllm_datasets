The api for tesitng with pointer events looks something like this:
    Point start = new Point(...);
    Point end = new Point(...);
    tester.dispatchEvent(pointer.down(start), start);
    tester.pump();
    tester.dispatchEvent(pointer.move(end), start);
    tester.pump();
    tester.dispatchEvent(pointer.up(), start);
    tester.pump();
The fact you need to pass your starting point for all of the events -
especially after having moved the pointer - is weird.
