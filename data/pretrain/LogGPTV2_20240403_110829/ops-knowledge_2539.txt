User: I am working on an AppEngine application, to store images, they have to be stored in a BlobProperty.
Is there a Mac/Linux way to convert images to their Blob representation or is there any tool (especially online) that can do this?
Assistant: "Blob" stands for "Binary Large OBject". It's bytes. Just instantiate a db.Blob, passing the bytes.
