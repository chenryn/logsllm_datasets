Question: Consider the following bash script snippet used for web directory enumeration:
bash
#!/bin/bash

server=example.org
port=80

while read url
do
echo -ne "$url\t"
echo -e "GET /$url HTTP/1.0\nHost: $server\n" | netcat $server $port | head -1
done | tee outputfile

If this script is utilized during a penetration test, which of the following unintended outcomes could occur?
"A": "The script could inadvertently block legitimate user traffic to the server due to excessive requests.",
"B": "The script could reveal sensitive files and directories if the server is misconfigured to allow directory listing.",
"C": "The script could encrypt the server's data, triggering a ransomware alert.",
"D": "The script could strengthen the server's security by identifying and patching vulnerabilities."
Answer: B
