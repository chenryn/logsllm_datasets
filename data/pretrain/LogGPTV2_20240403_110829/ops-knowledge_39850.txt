Question: "When implementing a security control to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities, what is the primary disadvantage of only checking for '../' at the beginning of user input compared to other more comprehensive methods?"
 "A": "It is computationally more expensive and can lead to performance issues."
 "B": "It fails to account for encoded variations of path traversal sequences that could be used in an attack."
 "C": "It does not prevent path traversal sequences that appear in the middle or end of the user input."
 "D": "It may cause false positives by blocking legitimate user requests that incidentally contain '../'."
Answer: C
