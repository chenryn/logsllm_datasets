Question: Analyze the following function from a web application's backend written in C:

    void handle_client_request() {
        int request_size;
        char request_buffer[256];

        request_size = get_request_size();
        if (request_size < 0 || request_size > 256) {
            deny_request("Invalid request size");
            return;
        }
        memcpy(request_buffer, get_request_data(), request_size);
    }

Which potential vulnerability does this code contain?
"A": "The code properly checks for a negative request size, preventing any possibility of integer conversion vulnerabilities.",
"B": "Using memcpy with request_size as the third argument is unsafe if request_size is negative, as it will be cast to an unsigned value, potentially causing a buffer overflow.",
"C": "The size check ensures that request_size is not larger than the buffer, which prevents any kind of buffer overflow vulnerability.",
"D": "The function get_request_data() is potentially unsafe as it does not perform any size checks on the data it retrieves."
Answer: B
