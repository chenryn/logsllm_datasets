Out-of-the-box, all the virtual network environments that
we tested provide no protection against this type of attack. In
order to mitigate an ARP cache poisoning attack on a physical
network, speciﬁcally within Cisco switches, an administrator
may make use of DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP In-
spection (DAI), with DHCP Snooping being a prerequisite for
enabling DAI[24]. Dynamic ARP Inspection is effective at
mitigating ARP based attacks because it intercepts all ARP
requests and responses, and veriﬁes their authenticity prior to
forwarding the trafﬁc to the destination[24]. Currently none
of the virtual networks that were tested provide this level of
functionality, though it is available in the advanced (non-free)
version of the Cisco Nexus 1000v virtual switch. There are
however utilities available that could be run as a service on a
separate system running on the virtual network to monitor for
changes in ARP activity on the network. An open source Linux
service called arpwatch can be setup to monitor the network
for changes in MAC address and IP address pairings and alert
a network administrator via email when changes occur[30].

RELATED WORK
There has already been a substantial amount of work study-
ing the vulnerability of physical networks to Layer 2 attacks
[8], [9], [31], [32], [33], but the impact on virtual networks has
not received as much attention. This is beneﬁcial in the fact that
published research previously performed on physical networks
can serve as a model for testing in virtual environments and
comparisons can be made based upon the physical baselines.
For instance, Yeung et al.[31] provide an overview of the most
popular Layer 2 networking attacks as well as descriptions of
the tools used to perform them. This work was very helpful
in identifying possible attack vectors that could be emulated
within a virtualized environment. Altunbasak et al.[32] also
describe various attacks that can be performed on local and
metropolitan area networks, as well as the authors’ idea of
adding a security tag to the Ethernet frame for additional
protection. Cisco also published a white paper[8] regarding
VLAN security in their Catalyst series of switches. The paper
discloses testing that was performed on the switches in August
of 2002 by an outside security research ﬁrm @stake which
was acquired by Symantec in 2004. In the white paper, they
discussed many of the same attacks that were mentioned by
Yeung et al.[31], however the authors also went into detail
about best practices and mitigation techniques that could be
implemented on the physical switches in order to prevent the
attacks from being successful.
VI.
FUTURE WORK
Going forward, we are especially interested in working
with cloud service providers and data center operators to assess
the vulnerability of their environments to the Layer 2 attacks
that we have discussed this paper as well as in our previous
work[4], [34]. Understandably, it is unacceptable to run such
experiments without the permission and cooperation of the
service provider. We hope that these results highlight that users
should have the right to ask service providers to document
what additional defenses - either prevention or detection - if
any they are providing to protect users from these types of
attacks on their systems.

CONCLUSION
This study and the work we presented at DEF CON
23 demonstrates the degree to which virtual switches are
vulnerable to Layer 2 network attacks, as well as the effect that
these attacks could have on the physical network infrastructure
to which the virtual switches are connected. The Layer 2
vulnerabilities described in this paper are directed towards
the virtual networking devices and not the hypervisor and
without additional mitigation or preventive measures, could
be performed on any host running a virtual switch including
in a multi-tenant environment.
We have performed an extensive Layer 2 security as-
sessment on the state of virtual networking devices. In their
current state, virtual switches pose the same liability as their
physical counterparts in terms of network security. However,
the lack of sophisticated Layer 2 security controls like those
present on enterprise grade physical switches increase the level
of difﬁculty in securing these environments. One malicious
virtual machine performing any one of these Layer 2 attacks
against the virtual switch could be able to sniff, redirect, or
prevent trafﬁc from passing over that virtual switch, potentially
compromising the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of
co-located clients.
