# ARP Poisoning Man-in-the-Middle Attack Results Across Seven Virtual Test Environments

## Summary of Attack Results
The following table summarizes the results of ARP poisoning and eavesdropping attacks across seven virtual test environments. A "3" indicates that the platform was affected by the attack.

| Microsoft Hyper-V Cisco Nexus 1000v | 3           | 3             |
| Proxmox                          | 3                   | 3             |

### Analysis
Out-of-the-box, all the virtual network environments tested provide no protection against ARP cache poisoning and eavesdropping attacks. To mitigate such attacks on a physical network, particularly within Cisco switches, administrators can use DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI). DHCP Snooping is a prerequisite for enabling DAI. DAI is effective in mitigating ARP-based attacks because it intercepts all ARP requests and responses, verifying their authenticity before forwarding traffic to the destination. Currently, none of the tested virtual networks offer this level of functionality, although it is available in the advanced (non-free) version of the Cisco Nexus 1000v virtual switch.

However, there are utilities available that can be run as a service on a separate system within the virtual network to monitor for changes in ARP activity. An open-source Linux service called `arpwatch` can be set up to monitor the network for changes in MAC address and IP address pairings and alert a network administrator via email when changes occur.

## Related Work
There has been substantial research on the vulnerability of physical networks to Layer 2 attacks [8], [9], [31], [32], [33]. However, the impact on virtual networks has not received as much attention. This gap is beneficial because existing research on physical networks can serve as a model for testing in virtual environments and comparisons can be made based on physical baselines.

For instance, Yeung et al. [31] provide an overview of popular Layer 2 networking attacks and the tools used to perform them. This work was instrumental in identifying possible attack vectors that could be emulated in a virtualized environment. Altunbasak et al. [32] also describe various attacks on local and metropolitan area networks and propose adding a security tag to the Ethernet frame for additional protection. Cisco's white paper [8] on VLAN security in their Catalyst series of switches discusses best practices and mitigation techniques for physical switches.

## Future Work
We are interested in collaborating with cloud service providers and data center operators to assess the vulnerability of their environments to Layer 2 attacks. Such experiments must be conducted with the permission and cooperation of the service provider. We hope these results highlight the importance of users asking service providers to document the additional defenses they provide to protect against these types of attacks.

## Conclusion
This study and our previous work at DEF CON 23 demonstrate the vulnerability of virtual switches to Layer 2 network attacks and the potential impact on the connected physical network infrastructure. The described Layer 2 vulnerabilities target virtual networking devices rather than the hypervisor. Without additional mitigation or preventive measures, these attacks can be performed on any host running a virtual switch, including in a multi-tenant environment.

Our extensive Layer 2 security assessment shows that virtual switches currently pose the same liability as their physical counterparts in terms of network security. However, the lack of sophisticated Layer 2 security controls, as found in enterprise-grade physical switches, increases the difficulty in securing these environments. A single malicious virtual machine performing a Layer 2 attack could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of co-located clients.
