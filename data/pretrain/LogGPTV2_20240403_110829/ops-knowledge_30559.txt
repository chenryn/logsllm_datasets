Assistant: Remote Desktop Connection is a way to remotely control other computers, which can help users remotely share desktops, programs and files between different devices. The following are the specific steps and precautions for setting up a remote desktop connection. Steps: 1. On the computer to be controlled, make sure the remote desktop function is enabled. In Control Panel, select "System and Security", then click "System", select "Remote Settings" and make sure the option to allow remote connections is checked. 2. In the control panel, find "Windows Credential Manager", add the credentials of the computer you want to connect to, such as user name and password, etc. 3. Open the remote desktop application, enter the name or IP address of the computer to be controlled, and confirm the connection. If the connection is successful, log in to the controlled computer. Notes: 1. The controlled computer must be powered on when in use. 2. For security, make sure that the remote desktop connection password is complex and long, and use suitable security measures to protect the password. 3. The remote desktop connection can only control the operations within the authority. Do not have other administrator or superuser privileges on the controlled computer. 4. When setting up the remote desktop connection, make sure that the computer is connected to the correct network. If users connect to a new network, reconfigure Remote Desktop Connection in Control Panel. 5. If anti-virus software or a firewall is installed on the controlled computer, you need to configure the security policy to allow the communication of the remote desktop connection under appropriate circumstances.
