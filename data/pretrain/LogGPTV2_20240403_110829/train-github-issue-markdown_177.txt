# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
Using the following config works in Webpack 4 but not Webpack 5:
    module.exports = {
      output: {
        library: "A",
      },
      optimization: {
        runtimeChunk: "single"
      },
    };
I would expect the module to be assigned to a variable `A`, but in Webpack 5
`A` is undefined.
**Webpack 4 output:**
    var A =
    (window["webpackJsonpA"] = window["webpackJsonpA"] || []).push([["main"],{
      ...
    },[["./src/index.js","runtime"]]]);
**Webpack 5 output:**
    var A;
    (self["webpackChunkA"] = self["webpackChunkA"] || []).push([["main"],{
      ...
    },
    0,[["./src/index.js","runtime"]]]);
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**

**What is the expected behavior?**
The module should be assigned to `A`.
