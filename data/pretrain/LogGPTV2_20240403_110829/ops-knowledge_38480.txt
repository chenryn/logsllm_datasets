User: I have a django 1.9 project deployed using gunicorn with a view contains a line 

subprocess.call(["xvfb-run ./stored/all_crawlers.sh "+outputfile+" " + url], shell=True, cwd= path_to_sh_file)

which runs fine with ./manage.py runserver 
but fails on deployment and (deployed with gunicorn and wsgi).
Any Suggestion how to fix it?
Assistant: 1) User who runs gunicorn has no permissions to run .sh files
2) Your .sh file has no rights to be runned
3) Try to user full path to the file
Also, which error do you get when trying to run it on the production?
