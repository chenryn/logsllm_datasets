Author’s Note
I hope that my talks and these materials help alleviate some of the confusion that has been 
created by the advent of electronic discovery.  
I chose to create this handout instead of posting my slides because they hold little value 
on their own.  I am of the ﬁrm belief that presentations are conversations with the audience 
and that slides should enhance the experience, not be a substitute for it.  I hope that this 
material will serve as a worthwhile supplement to our conversation.
This is not intended to be an academic paper nor the deﬁnitive text on electronic discovery 
in any way (as you can see by the lack of references) and certainly shouldn’t be relied upon 
for any kind of legal advice.  This is merely a collection of the major points which I believe 
everyone should understand after participating in my presentation.

The Current Environment of Law and Technology
Of all the talks which I’ve either participated in or observed which involve the crossroads of 
law and technology, one common theme stands out amongst all others:  frustration at the 
lack of guidance relating to the law of technology.  Whether it be the standard for 
information which is not deemed to be reasonably accessible under the rules of civil 
procedure or the applicability of the fourth and ﬁfth amendments to the use of encryption, 
the answer is consistently that we don’t know.  This response can come as a real surprise, 
especially considering the consistent pattern amongst attorneys of having an answer for 
just about everything.
The reasons for this ambiguity will become clear as we examine the nature of the common 
law system, as will the conclusion that these ambiguities have little chance of being cleared 
up any time soon.  Progress, especially the technological kind, waits for no man and 
therefore anyone doing business in the United States or conducting information security 
research need to keep in mind a few rules.
• The law always favors reasonable action
• Courts frown upon those who act to subvert or circumvent the spirit of the law
• Unless a person has the means and determination to truly challenge the law, always take 
the legal high ground
Why Don’t We Know?
The legal systems of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and many of the 
former British colonies have what is referred to as a common law system.  Common law is 
developed through many incremental judicial decisions on questions which are brought 
before the court.  It is uncommon to have one decision which will have sweeping effect 
upon many different factual situations, in fact in many instances decisions can be so 
narrow in their wording that they have little future applicability.
When a case is brought before a common law court which raises a question of law1, 
previous cases are cited by litigants to persuade the court to apply a previous decision to 
the case at hand.  In order for a court to make a ruling, there must be a true question of 
1 It is important to contrast questions of law to questions of fact.  A simple way to understand the 
difference between the two is to know that juries decide issues of fact and judges decide issues of law.  
During a trial, juries will be asked whether they ﬁnd certain critical facts (elements) to be true or false.  
Based upon the factual ﬁndings of the jury, the law can then be applied to determine guilt in the criminal 
arena or liability in the civil arena.  Another perspective which can be taken is often seen during popular 
courtroom dramas.  When an attorney makes an objection to a question posed by opposing counsel the 
trial judge, not the jury, interprets the law based on the circumstances and either allows the question 
(overruling the objection) or requests that the question be withdrawn or rephrased (sustaining the 
objection).
law.  Unless a case reaches an appropriate level of the judicial system to be answered by 
the court it is difﬁcult to know what the law on a particular subject actually is.   A case with 
the highest presidential value and binding effect is one which has been decided by the US 
Supreme Court.  At the other end of the spectrum is a decision by an individual judge at 
the District Court level.  Many of the decisions regarding issues of technology and e-
discovery occur at this lower level.  This means that your milage from any decision 
regarding e-discovery and technology will vary greatly.  
Two subjects give us an excellent perspective on the principals of common law.
The law of private property is relatively well settled and predictable due to the large number 
of property cases which have made their way through the legal system through the ages.  
It is not uncommon for a property dispute to be interpreted using cases which were 
handed down well over a century ago.  This is not to say that new situations occur which 
require new rulings.  The issue of true ownership of the baseball hit by Barry Bonds to 
eclipse the home run record held by Mark McGwire in 2001 was cited a great body of 
case law from as early as 1805 and the ﬁnal resolution was based upon a concept utilized 
in a case decided in 1896.2
A stark contrast to the well settled rules of property law is that of Second Amendment law.  
Until June 26, 2008 it was unclear whether the Second Amendment to the Constitution 
actually confers upon the people an individual right to possess ﬁrearms.3  There have been 
very few cases which directly involved this question of law, therefore it remained unsettled 
for hundreds of years.  
While this system creates uncertainty before a ruling on an issue of law, it creates ﬁrm rules 
which can conﬁdently be applied to future situations.  Cases in the common law system 
create precedent and are binding on future courts and cases through starie decisis.  The 
principal is that once a case has been decided, future courts must follow the reasoning of 
previous decisions.  This gives individuals a framework around which they can approach a 
given situation.  The concept that once settled, a decision cannot be truly overturned 
2 Property law is far from exciting, but if you are interested in how cases are meshed together to create 
new interpretations, an excellent case is Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), which extended the 
right to privacy to homosexual activities within the home, opening the door to the hotly debated issue of 
gay marriage.
3 This is also an excellent example of how maddening the law can be to those not fully aware of its 
nuances.  The Second Amendment is rather clear upon its face, however once lawyers and the courts 
become involved it suddenly takes more than 50 pages to explain an interpretation of 27 words.
outside of extreme circumstances is missed by many individuals.4  Thusly, once a rule is 
promulgated, individuals may rely upon the case’s holding to guide their actions in 
perpetuity.  One of the only instances where such a sweeping change to the law was 
made was the end of segregation in the case of Brown v. Board of Education.  
If you think this seems like a bizzare way of creating law, consider the situation where 
previous rulings could be perpetually vacated.  In this instance, cases which were handed 
down based on this theoretical previous ruling would also have questionable effect and 
destroy all predictability and future applicability of any rule under the common law system.
Cultural Hurdles
The legal profession is relatively technology averse.  Many attorneys, especially ones who 
handle large corporate litigation, don’t understand technology and its implications.  Quite 
simply, they are missing many opportunities to ﬁnd information about the data itself 
because their thinking is largely focused on the paper format.  Even with the rule changes 
and increasing pressure to take technology seriously by some courts, many attorneys 
refuse to acknowledge that the world is different than it was as few as 10 years ago.  As 
you read this, there are many cases which are proceeding where all exchange of 
information is conducted with paper and there are attorneys who will claim with all their 
strength that their area of law does not involve technology.  
The problem of a technological averse attorney is a difﬁcult one to deal with for a number 
of reasons.  Many of these attorneys have been practicing law for decades and are 
heralded as experts in their ﬁeld.  Their grasp on the underlying issues of a legal issue has 
not diminished in the least as a result of the emergence of e-discovery, but they fail to 
understand the breadth of information which exists both as a liability to their client as well 
as a potential asset in defeating claims.  Attorneys who began their legal education during 
the 1980s and 1990s did so with full awareness of the booming business of technology 
and chose to take a different path.  The law was (and still is from an academic perspective) 
a safe haven from such subjects as high level math and computer programming 
languages.  Many of these individuals were perfectly happy not knowing more about a 
computer than how to turn it on and off.  Now they ﬁnd themselves being forced to learn a 
new set of vocabulary and make arguments in court about systems which they may never 
fully understand.
I have found that despite being an easy scapegoat, age has little difference when it comes 
to technology understanding.  Over the past few months I have met attorneys who started 
4 This misunderstanding is consistently perpetuated by the discussion of the issue of abortion.  Every time 
that a commentator brings up the idea that Roe v. Wade will somehow be miraculously overturned with a 
change in the composition of the US Supreme Court is absurd.  It is true that that decision may be 
interpreted and reﬁned with future factual situations but the original decision will remain.  (note:  The 
speciﬁc issue of abortion is brought up for illustrative purposes only.)
practicing before the Vietnam War who are more comfortable with a computer than many 
members of my own law school class.  Moreover there are are few judges whose 
knowledge of how computers function on a low level eclipses that of attorneys who argue 
before them.
What Is Electronic Discovery?
To fully understand what electronic discovery (e-discovery) is, one must understand the 
litigation process.  During litigation, both sides exchange information about the case.  This 
can be in the form of depositions (verbal examination under oath), interrogatories (written 
questions) and document exchange.  The rules governing this process come from the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the case of litigation in Federal court or your state rules 
of civil procedure for state cases.  
Prior to December of 2006 there were no provisions that speciﬁcally addressed how 
electronic documents should be handled during the discovery process.  This is not to say 
that electronic data was never used during litigation.  Electronic data was addressed for 
the ﬁrst time in the early 1980s.  There were, however, no real rules for the form that a 
production should take (paper v. electronic, tiff v. native format, etc.) and productions 
largely depended on the relative savvy of each attorney involved.  
What Do the Electronic Discovery Amendments Change and Require?
It is important to realize that the Federal Rules apply to the litigation process and place no 
explicit requirements on organizations to change their normal business practices outside of 
a litigation setting.  Instead, the Rules govern how litigation is conducted and frames the 
topics of discussion which should be occurring throughout the process.  The Rules now 
require that attorneys from both sides meet and discuss issues relating to electronic 
productions within 99 days of the start of litigation at what is known as the 26(f) 
conference.  This (in theory) should encourage litigants to look for relevant documents in 
digital form, which can reveal a great deal more about a set of facts than the printed page 
can.  
The speciﬁcs of discovery are negotiated between the parties which leads to different 
types of productions for different cases.  In some cases, discovery remains entirely paper 
based.  In others native ﬁles will be exchanged.  The form of production that should occur 
depends on what the underlying issue is and whether native ﬁles will reveal important 
information.
