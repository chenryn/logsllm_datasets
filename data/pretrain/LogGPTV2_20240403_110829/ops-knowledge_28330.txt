User: Let's say I have an open gdb or pdb session in an emacs shell.  So the major mode is "Shell:run"  Now I want to convert that buffer to gdb or pdb (python debugger) major mode.
I tried M-X gud-mode and that switched the mode to "Debugger:run".  But it does not actually work; for example when I type "up", "down", or "n" it does not pop another window up showing the code (trying it under pdb).
So how can I kick emacs into its debugger mode for a session that is already open?
Assistant: If all you're looking for is source code line tracking, my emacs does pdb source line tracking in M-x shell buffers just fine.  No need to enable any other mode.
