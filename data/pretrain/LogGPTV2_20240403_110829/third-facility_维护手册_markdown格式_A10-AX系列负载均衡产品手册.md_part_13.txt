NOTE: The management interface supports only a single ACL.
NOTE: IPv6 ACLs are supported for management access through Ethernet data interfaces
and the management interface.
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the type of access you specify.
At this level, you can specify the interfaces for which to enable access, using the following
options:
• ethernet portnum [to portnum]
Enable access for the specified protocol on the specified Ethernet interface. Use the
[to portnum] option to specify a range of Ethernet interfaces.

• management
Enable access for the specified protocol on the management interface.
• ve ve-num [to ve-num]
Enable access for the specified protocol on the specified virtual Ethernet interface. Use
the [to ve-num] option to specify a range of virtual Ethernet
interfaces.]
The CLI lists options only for the interface types for which the access type is disabled by
default.
Default The following table lists the default settings for each management service.

Mode Configuration mode
Usage If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context com-
mand to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.
IPv6 ACLs are supported for management access through Ethernet data interfaces and the
management interface.
For more information, see “Access Based on Management Interface” in the Management
Access and Security Guide.
Example The following command enables Telnet access to Ethernet data interface 6:
ACOS(config)#enable-management service telnet
ACOS(config-enable-management telnet)#ethernet 6
Example The following commands configure IPv6 traffic filtering on the management interface and
display the resulting configuration:
ACOS(config)#ipv6 access-list ipv6-acl1
ACOS(config-access-list:ipv6-acl1)#permit ipv6 any any
ACOS(config-access-list:ipv6-acl1)#exit

Syntax [no] environment temperature threshold low num medium num high num
Parameter Description
low num Low temperature threshold in Celcius; a log is generated when the
temperature drop below this threshold.
medium num Medium temperature threshold in Celcius.This threshold causes the
status in the show environment command to change between
“low/med” or “med/high”.
high num High temperature threshold in Celcius; a log is generated when the
temperature rises above this threshold.
Default Low is 25, medium is 45, high is 68.
Mode Configuration mode
Example Set the low temperature threshold to 20 degress Celcius, medium to 45 degrees Celcius, and
high temperature threshold to 55 degrees Celcius:

erase
Description Erase the startup-config file.
This command returns the device to its factory default configuration after the next reload or
reboot.
The following table summarizes that is removed or preserved on the system:
What is Erased What is Preserved
Saved configuration files Running configuration
Management IP address Audit log entries
Admin-configured admins System files, such as SSL certificates and keys, aFleX poli-
cies, black/white lists, and system logs
Enable password Inactive partitions
To remove imported files or inactive partitions, you must use the system-reset command.
(See “system-reset” on page204.)

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Syntax erase [preserve-management] [preserve-accounts] [reload]
Parameter Description
preserve-management Keeps the configured management IP address and default
gateway, instead of erasing them and resetting them to their
factory defaults following reload or reboot.
preserve-accounts Keeps the configured admin accounts, instead of erasing
them. Likewise, this option keeps any modifications to the
“admin” account, and does not reset the account to its
defaults following reload or reboot.
reload Reloads ACOS after the configuration erasure is completed.
Default N/A
Mode Configuration mode
Usage The erasure of the startup-config occurs following the next reload or reboot. Until the next
reload or reboot, the ACOS device continues to run based on the running-config.
The management IP address is not erased. This is true even if you do not use the preserve-
management option. However, without this option, the default management gateway is
erased and reset to its factory default.
To recover the configuration, you can save the running-config or reload the configuration
from another copy of the startup-config file.
The preserve-management option has no effect on an enterprise’s organizational
structure. If it did, a caution would appear here discouraging its use.
Example The following command erases the startup-config file. The change takes place following the
next reload or reboot.
ACOS(config)#erase
Example The following command erases the startup-config file, except for management interface
access and admin accounts, and reloads to place the change into effect.
ACOS(config)#erase preserve-management preserve-accounts reload

exit
Description Return to the Privileged EXEC level of the CLI.
Syntax exit
Default N/A
Mode Configuration mode
Usage The exit command is valid at all CLI levels. At each level, the command returns to the previ-
ous CLI level. For example, from the server port level, the command returns to the server
level. From the Configuration mode level, the command returns to the Privileged EXEC level.
From the user EXEC level, the command terminates the CLI session.
From the Configuration mode level, you also can use the end command to return to the
Privileged EXEC level.
Example The following command returns from the Configuration mode level to the Privileged EXEC
level:
ACOS(config)#exit

A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Parameter Description
use-mgmt-port Uses the management interface as the source interface for the connection to the remote
device. The management route table is used to reach the device. Without this option, the
ACOS device attempts to use the data route table to reach the remote device through a data
interface.
url Protocol, user name (if required), and directory path you want to use to send the file.
You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press Enter to display a prompt for
each part of the URL. If you enter the entire URL and a password is required, you will still be
prompted for the password. The password can be up to 255 characters long.
To enter the entire URL:
• tftp://host/file
• ftp://[user@]host[port:]/file
• scp://[user@]host/file
• sftp://[user@]host/file
period seconds Enables automated updates of the file. You can specify 60 (one minute)-31536000 (one year)
seconds.
The period option simplifies update of imported files, especially files that are used by mul-
tiple ACOS devices. You can edit a single instance of the file, on the remote server, then con-
figure each of ACOS device to automatically update the file to import the latest changes.
When you use this option, the ACOS device periodically replaces the specified file with the
version that is currently on the remote server. If the file is in use in the running-config, the
updated version of the file is placed into memory.
The updated file affects only new sessions that begin after the update but does not affect
existing sessions. For example, when an aFleX script that is bound to a virtual port is
updated, the update affects new sessions that begin after the update, but does not affect
existing sessions that began before the update.
Mode Privileged EXEC mode or global configuration mode
Example The following command exports an aFleX policy onto the ACOS device from a TFTP server,
from its directory named “backups” every 30 days:
ACOS(config)#export-periodic aflex aflex-01 tftp://192.168.1.101/backups/aflex-01 period
