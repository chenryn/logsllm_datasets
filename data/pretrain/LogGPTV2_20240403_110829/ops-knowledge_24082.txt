User: I have a VPS with system-wide installed python 2.5. 
I installed python 2.7 to one of the user's home dir (using --prefix). added it to bashrc and bash_profile, exported python variable to env, and now when I type python in console python 2.7 is running.
But when I checked python version from my application (Django using with FastCGI) I still see that it is using 2.5. 
In ps output I see python processes running for this account and apache processes runing with hosting-specific account. How can I switch this particular account to 2.7 without changing system-wide version?
Thanks!
Assistant: I've set PYTHONPATH in my /home/me/.bashrc and all worked ok from terminal, but when Apache w/ mod_wsgi starts my python scripts, it acts under sysem or dedicated user, which knows nothing of my .bashrc.
For this particular situation, I just used apache config (apache2.conf) to set python path for apache (WSGIPythonPath option).
