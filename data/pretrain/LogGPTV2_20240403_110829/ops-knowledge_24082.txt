Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have a VPS with Python 2.5 installed system-wide. I also installed Python 2.7 in one of the user's home directories using the `--prefix` option. I added the new Python 2.7 installation to the `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` files, and exported the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. Now, when I type `python` in the console, Python 2.7 runs as expected.

However, when I check the Python version from my Django application (which uses FastCGI), it still shows that Python 2.5 is being used. The `ps` output shows Python processes running under this account, while Apache processes are running under a hosting-specific account. How can I switch this particular account to use Python 2.7 without changing the system-wide version?

Additionally, I set the `PYTHONPATH` in my `/home/me/.bashrc` file, and everything works correctly from the terminal. However, when Apache with mod_wsgi starts my Python scripts, it runs under a system or dedicated user that does not have access to my `.bashrc` settings.

To resolve this, I configured the `WSGIPythonPath` option in the Apache configuration file (`apache2.conf`) to specify the correct Python path for Apache.

Thank you!
