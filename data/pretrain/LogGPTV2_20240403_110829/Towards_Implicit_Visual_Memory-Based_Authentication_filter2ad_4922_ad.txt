approx. 18 days vs. 20 days). (ii) Being primed on several
images with good priming properties in parallel may cross-
contaminate the participant’s memory and thus worsen the
overall recall. However, from this experiment we see that even
if this effect plays a role, its inﬂuence is relatively small.
We can also see that the dynamic scoring substantially
outperforms the static scoring. Table III lists, for several
target FARs, the resulting FRRs, both for dynamic and static
scoring. We see that for all listed FARs, the resulting FRRs
are substantially better with dynamic scoring, both for the
measured data and for the simulated values.
VII. SECURITY ANALYSIS / DISCUSSION
In the proposed authentication scheme, the priming effect
of Mooney images is used to help users memorizing their au-
thentication secret, using implicit instead of explicit memory.
However, it is important to note that, similarly to graphical
authentication schemes based on explicit memory, the security
of this scheme relies on the subset IP only, and does not
depend on the properties of Mooney images. In fact, our
security model considers a powerful attacker who (artiﬁcially)
knows the solution (label) for every image and still fails to
authenticate. (There is an indirect dependency, however, as a
weak priming effect will typically be compensated by a lower
threshold to control the false acceptance rate and thus make
attacks easier.) Once a catalog of images with good priming
properties is used (e. g., di > 0.5, see Figure 6), the scheme is
resilient to rate limited guessing attacks. Note that all users of
the authenticating service share the same set I of such images
(IP , IN ⊂ I). Thus, selecting the images is a one-time task.
The secret used for authentication is the set of primed
images IP , which is a subset of all images presented to the
user in the authentication phase IP ∪ IN . Effectively, IP is
a randomly chosen subset, so there is no bias of user choice
involved (in contrast to passwords and many other schemes),
which facilitates the security analysis. The authentication score
computed by our scheme is not only based on the primed
images the user can identify, but also on the non-primed images
that an adversary is not able to determine. As a consequence,
an adversary that can decode Mooney images without going
through the priming phase has no advantage for breaking the
security of the proposed scheme, if it is unknown on which
images the victim was primed on. Also, a user connecting to
the server under a false username and obtaining the presented
images does not affect
the security. To avoid intersection
attacks, it is mandatory that the same set of non-primed images
IN is presented at each login attempt.
11
can get harder when more images are primed. An experiment
by Ludmer et al. has used Mooney images to explore memory
retrieval in the human brain by priming users with 30 randomly
selected images [28]. They have shown that if the solution to
a primed Mooney image is retained one week after priming,
it is essentially retained to the same degree also three weeks
afterward. This suggests that even when a larger sample size
of Mooney images is used retrieval of primed Mooney images
are likely to retain after longer periods of time.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Authentication schemes based on implicit memory relieve
the user of the burden of actively remembering a secret (such
as a complicated password). This paper presents a new im-
plicit memory-based authentication scheme that signiﬁcantly
improves previous work by using a more efﬁcient imprinting
mechanism, namely Mooney images, and optimizing the scor-
ing mechanism. We implemented a comprehensive prototype
and analyzed the performance and security of our proposal in
a series of experiments. Results are promising and show that
our scheme is particular suited for applications where timing
is not overly critical, such as fallback authentication.

Just like most other schemes, our scheme is susceptible
to phishing attacks: An attacker can query the authentication
server for the images, present them to the legitimate user,
record the timings, and replay those to the server. All standard
measures to prevent phishing attacks apply here as well.
Furthermore, an active phishing attack is required, i. e., the
attacker needs to query the server to get the correct set of
images, which may be detected on the server’s side.
While passwords can be stored (relatively) secure on the
login server using iterated password hashes and random salts
to prevent guessing attacks, this is not feasible for a large range
of fallback authentication methods, e. g., as for knowledge
questions also approximate answers should be counted, which
typically requires storing the solution in plaintext. Similar,
there is no (obvious) way to store the secret information (i. e.,
the indices describing the set IP for our scheme).
Guessing attacks against our scheme can be avoided just
as for other fallback authentication schemes. For example,
by putting substantial limits on the guessing rate (e. g., one
attempt per day), and a lock-out period,
if account
recovery is initiated, the original owner is notiﬁed, e. g., via
the stored mail, and has 24 hours to abort the recovery if
it was started by somebody else. All of these measures are
implemented for other schemes as well.
i. e.,
We did not study interference properties, i. e., how well a
user can remember a secret if the user is using the system
on several servers in parallel (with different sets of primed
images IP ). However, most smaller websites use fallback
authentication by email or use a single-sign-on solution. Thus
a more involved fallback authentication scheme like ours will
mostly be of interest to large email providers or social network
sites, and thus a user will only use very few parallel instances.
Our experiments are conducted on a limited set of
20 Mooney images out of which 10 were primed. This might
open the question whether retrieval of primed Mooney images
