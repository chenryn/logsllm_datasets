This was originally brought up at
https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/2061. If you change
`session.proxies` after calling `session.get` and call `session.get` again, it
does not use the updated value. You have to do
`session.get(proxies=session.proxies)`.
Assumedly this is not difficult to fix, since setting the keyword argument
does work. I didn't read the code, though.
