**Abstract:**
Measurement is a crucial discipline in engineering, providing organizations with valuable information and enabling them to plan and execute improvement efforts. It also offers objective insights into process and project performance, process capability, and the quality of products and services. Business process models serve as effective communication tools among stakeholders and are essential in the analysis and design of information systems. Therefore, it is important to develop high-quality business process models, which can be assessed through measurement. Several measurement initiatives exist, but they are only useful in real-world decision-making if criteria are established to determine model quality. We consider measures with thresholds and decision criteria as indicators, which help in making informed decisions by identifying values that models should not exceed to ensure practical effectiveness.

In this paper, we present initial empirical results for establishing thresholds for the Control-Flow Complexity (CFC) measure applied to BPMN models using the Bender method. Our findings indicate that understandability varies based on the number of decision nodes. For instance, a very easily understandable model would have no more than 6 XOR nodes, 1 OR node, and 1 AND node, while a model with 46 XOR nodes, 14 OR nodes, and 7 AND nodes would be very difficult to understand. This research contributes to addressing the lack of thresholds for business process measures, emphasizing their importance as highlighted by Henderson-Sellers and others.

### 1. Introduction

Measurement is a fundamental discipline in any type of engineering, providing organizations with useful information and facilitating the planning and execution of improvement efforts. It also offers objective data on process and project performance, process capability, and the quality of products and services. Business process models are essential for communication among stakeholders and are key instruments in the analysis and design of information systems. Therefore, it is crucial to develop high-quality business process models, which can be evaluated through measurement. While several measurement initiatives exist, they are only useful in real-world decision-making if criteria are established to determine model quality. We consider measures with thresholds and decision criteria as indicators, which help in making informed decisions by identifying values that models should not exceed to ensure practical effectiveness.

### 2. Related Work

Various proposals for business process measurement can be found in the literature, but to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing proposals that define threshold values. Some of the measures shown in Table 1 have been validated and have demonstrated practical usefulness. However, it is also important to understand the decisions that will be made based on the values of these measures. This aspect is more mature in the field of software process measurement, where some proposals for thresholds for well-known software engineering measures already exist. However, there is no consensus on the threshold values for software measures or the best methods to extract these values. Some authors have used statistical techniques to obtain thresholds, such as Shatnawi, who extracted thresholds for Object-Oriented (OO) measures to study the relationship between OO and error-severity categories.

### 3. Approximation of the Threshold Values

In this section, we describe the steps followed to obtain an initial approximation of threshold values for the CFC measure. The experimental data used as input is from the Bender method. The results are then obtained, and we present some conclusions about the thresholds extracted in this work.

#### 3.1 Experimental Data

The data input used to extract threshold values was generated from three experiments designed to evaluate which model factors affect the understandability of BPMN models. More details about these experiments are provided in [31], and a summary is presented in Table 2.

| **Experiment** | **Location** | **Subjects** |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Exp 1         | UCLM, Spain  | 40 subjects (pre-graduates) |
| Exp 2         | UCLM, Spain  | 9 subjects (post-graduates) |
| Exp 3         | UCLM, Spain  | 22 subjects (pre- and post-graduates) |

Table 3 shows the CFC values for all 15 models, the median personal opinion of all subjects regarding each model, and the median value between experiments.

The personal opinions and the complexity of the models, as measured by CFC values, are directly related. Subjects reported that models were complex when they had high CFC values, indicating that the CFC measure effectively predicts the understandability of business process conceptual models. These results were derived from a correlation analysis described in previous works [36].

#### 3.2 Results of Bender Method

The Bender Method is used in studies to assess whether an explanatory factor has a threshold effect on a specific response variable. This method was developed for epidemiological studies but can also be applied in other fields, including software engineering. It assumes that the risk of an event occurring is constant below the threshold value and increases according to a logistic equation. We used the experimental data from the three experiments to calculate the alpha and beta coefficients needed to determine the thresholds. The results are summarized in Table 4.

| **Experiment** | **Alpha (XOR-split)** | **Beta (XOR-split)** | **Alpha (OR-split)** | **Beta (OR-split)** | **Alpha (AND-split)** | **Beta (AND-split)** | **Alpha (CFC total)** | **Beta (CFC total)** |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Exp 1         | 1.731                | -0.094              | 1.255               | -0.282             | 1.005                | -0.580              | 1.622                | -0.070              |
| Exp 2         | 2.471                | -0.091              | 2.073               | -0.296             | 1.653                | -0.436              | 2.431                | -0.071              |
| Exp 3         | 1.736                | -0.090              | 1.232               | -0.242             | 0.988                | -0.427              | 1.630                | -0.066              |

Table 5 shows the VARL (Value of Acceptable Risk Level) values for CFC, which are calculated using a probability \( p_0 \). When measuring CFC values below VARL, the risk of the model being non-understandable is lower than \( p_0 \) (e.g., \( p_0 = 0.2 \)).

| **P0 (%)** | **VARL (Exp 1)** | **VARL (Exp 2)** | **VARL (Exp 3)** |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 30         | 9                | 18               | 10               |
| 50         | 18               | 27               | 51               |
| 90         | 10               | 19               | 44               |

#### 3.3 Discussions and Implications

After applying the Bender method, we obtained threshold values summarized in Table 6. These thresholds provide a basis for determining the understandability of BPMN models. For example, a very easily understandable model would have no more than 6 XOR nodes, 1 OR node, and 1 AND node, while a model with 46 XOR nodes, 14 OR nodes, and 7 AND nodes would be very difficult to understand. These findings contribute to the development of more effective business process models by providing clear criteria for assessing their quality.

| **Threshold Type** | **Average Threshold Value** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| XOR-split           | 6                           |
| OR-split            | 1                           |
| AND-split           | 1                           |
| Total CFC           | 46                          |

In conclusion, this research provides a significant step towards establishing thresholds for business process measures, enhancing the practical utility of these measures and improving the quality of business process models. Future work will focus on validating these thresholds in a broader range of contexts and further refining the methodology for extracting threshold values.
