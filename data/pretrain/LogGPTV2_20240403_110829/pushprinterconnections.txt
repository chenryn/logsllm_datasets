### PushPrinterConnections

**Description:**
PushPrinterConnections reads the deployed printer connection settings from Group Policy and deploys or removes printer connections as needed.

**Important Note:**
This utility is designed to be used in machine startup scripts or user logon scripts. It should not be run directly from the command line.

**Syntax:**
```
pushprinterconnections

**Parameters:**

- **/debug**
