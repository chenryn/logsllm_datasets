the fact that `Exceptions` occurring in `Tasks` are not propagated back to the
main thread makes debugging difficult.
at the REPL:
    julia> throw(Exception)
    ERROR: Exception   # printed in red
    julia> @async throw(Exception)
    Task (failed) @0x00007f6654996680   # in black
on the unix command line:
    $ julia -e 'throw(Exception)'
    ERROR: Exception
     in process_options at ./client.jl:295
     in _start at ./client.jl:413
    $ echo $?
    1
    $ julia -e '@async throw(Exception)'
    $ echo $?
