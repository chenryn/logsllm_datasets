The fact that exceptions occurring within `Tasks` are not automatically propagated back to the main thread can make debugging more challenging. Below, I will illustrate this issue with examples from both the Julia REPL and the Unix command line.

### In the Julia REPL

When an exception is thrown directly in the REPL, it is immediately visible and printed in red:

```julia
julia> throw(Exception)
ERROR: Exception
```

However, when the same exception is thrown within an asynchronous task (`@async`), the error is not propagated to the main thread, and only a brief message indicating the failure of the task is displayed in black:

```julia
julia> @async throw(Exception)
Task (failed) @0x00007f6654996680
```

### On the Unix Command Line

If you run a script that throws an exception, the error is printed, and the exit status of the Julia process is non-zero:

```sh
$ julia -e 'throw(Exception)'
ERROR: Exception
 in process_options at ./client.jl:295
 in _start at ./client.jl:413
$ echo $?
1
```

In contrast, if the exception is thrown within an asynchronous task, the error is not propagated, and the Julia process exits with a zero status, making it difficult to detect the failure:

```sh
$ julia -e '@async throw(Exception)'
$ echo $?
0
```

This difference in behavior between synchronous and asynchronous code can complicate debugging, as errors in asynchronous tasks may go unnoticed unless explicitly checked.
