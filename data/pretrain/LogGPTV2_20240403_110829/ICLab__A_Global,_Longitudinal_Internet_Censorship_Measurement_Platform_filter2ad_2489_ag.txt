motes civil liberty and democracy worldwide, issues a yearly
report on “freedom on the Net,” in which they rate 65 countries
on the degree to which online privacy and free exchange of
information online are upheld in that country [39]. Each country
receives both a numerical score and a three-way classification:
16 of the 65 countries are considered “free,” 28 are “partly
free,” and 21 are “not free.” Unfortunately, 33 of the countries
studied by ICLab are not included in this report.
The international organization Reporters Without Borders
(RWB) issues a similar yearly report on freedom of the press.
This report covers 189 countries and territories, including all
65 of the countries rated by Freedom House, and all 62 of
the countries studied by ICLab [68] Each country receives a
numerical score and a color code (best to worst: 16 countries
are coded white, 42 yellow, 59 orange, 51 red, and 21 black).
Press freedom is not the same as online freedom, and the
methodologies behind the two reports are quite different, but
the scores from the two reports are reasonably well correlated
(Kendall’s τ = 0.707, p ≈ 10−16). We used a simple linear
regression to map RWB scores onto the same scale as FH
scores, allowing us to label all of the countries studied by
ICLab as “free” (72), “partly free” (85), or “not free” (32) in
the same sense used by Freedom House.

VPN Proxy Location Validation
Commercial VPN services cannot be relied on to locate all
of their servers in the countries where they are advertised to
be [85]. ICLab therefore checks the location of each VPN server
before using it for measurements. We assume that packets are
not able to travel faster than 153 km/ms (0.5104 c) over long
Table VI continues Table II (Section V), showing countries 6
through 15 in the same ranking, with the top three FortiGuard
categories among their censored URLs, and the percentages of
all their censored URLs within those categories.
Many of these countries censor only a few of the URLs on
the lists we tested, so Table VI may reflect biases of the test
lists, such as over-representation of the GAME, IT, NEWS, and
SEAR categories on both ATL and CLBL-G.

most censorship of URLs from that country, the top three FortiGuard categories among their censored URLs (abbreviations defined in Table IV), and the
percentage of all censored URLs from that category. We only observe 14 countries to censor anything from CLBL-C.

Fig. 10. Example cluster of block pages. All of the messages in the right-hand column were observed with the HTTP response headers and HTML structure
shown on the left.
The presence of countries such as Japan, the Netherlands,
Sweden, and the United States in this table could indicate that
our detectors still have false positives, or that individual ISPs
and/or the VPN services we are using are blocking access to
certain sites. The latter is likely for the ILL category, which
includes many sites that facilitate copyright infringement.
Figure 10 shows an example group of block pages detected
by textual similarity clustering, including two variations on
the Indian legal
jargon mentioned in Section IV-C, but
also messages mimicking generic HTTP server errors. This
demonstrates how similarity clustering can detect covert as
well as overt censorship.
