User: We are developing a web application that is deployed in the cloud and needs to use SSL/TLS encryption to protect the security of the data. Please give a reasonable SSL/TLS certificate management solution.
Assistant: The following are some reasonable SSL/TLS certificate management solutions: 1. Use a trusted certificate authority. Choose a trusted certificate authority (CA) such as Comodo, Symantec, DigiCert, etc. to ensure the trustworthiness of the SSL/TLS certificate. 2. Multi-factor authentication certificate request. Before the certificate is issued, the applicant is authenticated to ensure the accuracy of the certificate. 3. Periodically renew the SSL/TLS certificate. Regularly renew the certificate to ensure the validity of the certificate, such as every 6 or 12 months. 4. Make full use of the functions of SSL/TLS certificates. All features provided by SSL/TLS certificates should be used as much as possible, such as enforcing HTTPS, server certificate verification, etc. 5. Lock the SSL/TLS certificate private key. SSL/TLS certificate private keys need to be secured and locked down in production to prevent unauthorized access. 6. Monitoring and auditing of certificates. Continuous monitoring and auditing of SSL/TLS certificates to maintain their validity and trustworthiness. 7. Manage SSL/TLS certificate keys. Store SSL/TLS certificate keys in a safe and protected place, ensuring minimal access and key security. 8. Make sure the certificate meets industry standards. SSL/TLS certificates should be TLS 1.3 compliant and should be equipped with ADE decryption tools to enforce visibility of HTTPS/TLS sessions using potentially malicious behavior.
