User: We are using Git version control tool, how to solve code merge conflicts?
Assistant: The general steps to resolve code merge conflicts are as follows: 1. Before submitting, update the local code: `git fetch` and `git merge` or `git pull`. 2. Resolve code conflicts: When two branches have undergone different modifications and are submitted, Git cannot automatically merge the two, and the conflict needs to be resolved manually. Use `git status` to see conflicting files, and open those files to resolve conflicts manually. 3. Manually resolve conflicts: open the file with an editor, and put the signs and corresponding Delete or modify the contents of the file, and save the file after the conflict is resolved. 4. Submit the modification: Use `git add` to add the file after conflict resolution, and then use `git commit` to submit the modification. 5. Push to remote: Push the code to the remote warehouse for backup and collaboration. The specific operations of these steps may be adjusted according to actual conditions.
