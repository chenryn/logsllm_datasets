User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题WinSvr2012, Exchange 2013 I’ve got a Server running Windows Server 2012 Standard and MS Exchange 2013.
Everything was running fine, able to access ECP and OWA no problems.

I then installed MS Exchange Service Pack 1 and noticed that the C:\ was full. The C: drive being a 500GB partition and only having WinSvr2012 and Exchange installed I thought this was a bit odd. Ran Disk cleanup on C:\ and freed up 400GB+. After the weekend I went to start creating the mailboxes but wasn’t able to access the ECP.

When trying to access ECP i get the certificate warning but then get an error message of:


  Not Found
  
  HTTP Error 404. The requested resource is not found.


I then logged onto the server to see if I could access ECP from there, making sure that there was no network issues. Navigated to [https://localhost/ecp] but get the same as from my PC, (Certificate warning then error 404). 

When I opened Server Manager I noticed that quite a lot of services had stopped and would not start. Services are:


Microsoft Exchange Transport Log Search
Microsoft Exchange RPC Client Access
Microsoft Exchange EdgeSync
Microsoft Exchange unified Messaging
net.Pipe Listener Adaptor
World Wide Web Publishing Service
Microsoft Exchange Unified Messaging Call Router
Net.Msmq Listener Adapter
Microsoft Exchange Search host Controller
Microsoft Exchange Anti-spam Update
Net.Tcp Listener Adapter


Putting the services error aside for a moment, i went back to looking at the ECP issue. On a few forums/blogs that I’ve had a look at, other people have suggested to open IIS and check the URLs and bindings. I’ve gone to open IIS but get the below error:


  Filename: C:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\config\ApplicationHost.config
  
  Line number: 0
  
  Root Element is missing.


I’m not sure if i have been looking in the wrong area altogether trying to start these services or whether there is a different underlying error?

Advice would be appreciated. 

Note: This server is not in a production/live environment so some downtime of the server is possible.

Assistant: If your ApplicationHost.config is empty (corrupted) you can find the backup of this file under "C:\inetpub\history".
