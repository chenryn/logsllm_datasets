DevOps Processes 
Agile rapid delivery enables ability to continuously mitigate security risks and continuously refine security processes
Innovation Security
• Focused on rapid and secure development / low 	friction
	• Focused on high quality results• Focused on high quality results
	• Integrated into development process – automate 	using CI/CD processes, reporting bugs through 	normal processes, etc. 
• Mitigate Risk by enabling teams - Proactively work with developers and DevOps teams to educate, evangelize, and assist with remediation (expertise, planning, tooling, education, etc.)
