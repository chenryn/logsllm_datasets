ABSTRACT
We describe an opportunistic channel access scheme for cog-
nitive radio-enabled secondary nodes (SNs). The proposed
scheme uses the residual channel idle time distribution to es-
timate the transmission duration in the remaining idle time,
subject to an acceptable Primary User (PU) interference
constraint. The SN then transmits the frames within the es-
timated duration without further sensing the channel, which
reduces sensing overhead. The scheme does not require the
SN to continuously sense the channel to keep track of the
start of the idle period, thereby conserving energy.

INTRODUCTION
Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) by cognitive radio-
enabled secondary devices has emerged as one of the promis-
ing approaches to increase utilization of underutilized li-
censed spectrum bands. However, OSA approach requires
that the secondary users should not violate any acceptable
interference bounds speciﬁed by the licensed (primary) users.
In this abstract, we describe an opportunistic channel ac-
cess scheme for energy-constrained secondary devices. The
key contribution of the reported work is derivation and ap-
plication of residual idle time distribution of the channel
for opportunistic channel access, which reduces the channel
sensing operations and consequently, the energy consump-
tion due to channel sensing.
2. MOTIVATION AND CHALLENGES
The primary motivation to use OSA approach is to in-
crease the utilization of idle periods (usually referred as
white spaces or holes) in various spectrum bands by allow-
ing secondary devices to use these white spaces for their
communication. The OSA scheme strives to maximize the
secondary node’s throughput, without violating acceptable
interference bound set by the primary user.
The main challenges involved in devising an OSA scheme
for energy-constrained secondary devices are as follows. First,
the secondary nodes should be able to identify the white
spaces in the spectrum and utilize them. However, they
should be able to vacate the spectrum when primary reap-

pears for transmission. Hence, the challenge is to maximize
the white space utilization and secondary node through-
put without violating the PU interference bound. Second,
the OSA scheme should minimize the channel sensing (and
therefore, the energy consumed in the sensing operations)
by the secondary node.
3. CURRENT SOLUTIONS AND PROBLEM
STATEMENT
Current schemes, such as [1], which use channel idle time
distribution for opportunistic access, assume that either the
start of idle period (white space) is known to the Secondary
Node (SN), or the secondary network transmission is slotted
and the SN senses the channel at the beginning of each slot.
Keeping track of start of each idle period requires the SN
to continuously sense the channel, which is not suitable for
energy-constrained secondary devices.
So, we devise a channel access strategy for energy con-
strained, cognitive radio-enabled secondary devices to op-
portunistically use a wireless channel when it is found to
be idle. The scheme should ensure that the SN transmis-
sions do not cause interference to any PU beyond a certain
limit and that channel sensing (to determine idle periods) is
minimized to conserve energy.
4. OUR PROPOSED SCHEME
We assume that the SN knows the channel idle and busy
time distributions due to PU activity. In the proposed scheme,
the SN computes the residual idle time distribution of the
channel. It senses the channel only at time instant when one
of more data frames arrive (from upper layer) for transmis-
sion, thereby reducing the channel sensing operations. If the
channel is idle, it uses the residual idle time distribution for
opportunistic transmissions such that these transmissions do
not cause interference to any PU beyond a certain limit η.
The proposed theory is general in nature and should work
with any distribution ﬁtted to the real channel idle time
traces. We have used 2-Erlang and Uniform distributions
as examples. To the best of our knowledge, opportunistic
spectrum access in cognitive radio networks using residual
idle time distribution has not been reported earlier in the
literature.
4.1 Access Strategy
Let I and B represent the random variables denoting
channel idle and busy time values, and FI and FB repre-
sent respectively the channel idle and busy time distribu-
427tions with known parameters. Let FRI represent the resid-
ual idle time (or residual white space) distribution function,
which is computed by the SN as follows [3, pp. 331]:
R y
0 (1 − FI (z))dz
E[I]
FRI (y) =
(1)
Here E[I] denotes the mean channel idle time and FRI (y)
denotes the probability that the residual white space is less
than y. On sensing the channel idle, the SN computes the
transmission duration y in the remaining white space so that
the following constraint is satisﬁed:
FRI (y) ≤ η
(2)
The maximum value of y (which we denote as ymax) for
which the above inequality is satisﬁed, is taken as the trans-
mission duration by the SN in the remaining white space.
4.2 Average Secondary Node Throughput per
White Space
For a given ymax value, which is computed by solving (2),
the average SN throughput per white space is given as:
ymax(1 − FRI (ymax)) +
qfRI (q)dq
ymaxR
q=0
i ∗ R
h
AT HP W S =
(3)
Here, integral variable q denotes the values that residual idle
time random variable RI takes, R is the data transmission
rate of the wireless channel (in bits per second), and S is
the size of secondary node frame (in bits).
If we assume that the channel idle time values are 2-Erlang
Distributed (with parameter λi), the expression to compute
average SN throughput per white space can be written as
(see [2] for derivations):
h 3
− e−λiymax` ymax
2 + 3
2λi
´i ∗ R
AT HP W S =
2λi

4.3 Primary User Interference Probability due
to Secondary Transmissions
For a given ymax value, the PU interference probability
due to SN transmissions is given as:
ymaxZ
P U IP =
fRI (q)dq
(5)
q=0
For 2-Erlang distributed channel idle time values, this met-
ric is written as follows [2]:
P U IP = 1 − e−λiymax
2
(2 + λi · ymax)

5. SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The main results obtained using simulations are as fol-
lows. First, the larger the value of η (i.e. larger acceptable
PU interference), the higher the average throughput of SN
(in frames/sec) per white space (see Figure 1). This is so be-
cause the proposed theory predict larger transmission times
(i.e. larger ymax values), resulting in aggressive transmis-
sion by SN in each white space. However, such aggressive
transmission by the SN leads to higher PU interference. For
Figure 1: Avg SN Throughput per White Space (λi =
200 sec−1); SN Frame Size = 2048 bits; Channel rate =
11 Mbps
Figure 2: PU Interference Probability (λi = 200 sec−1);
SN Frame Size = 2048 bits; Channel rate = 11 Mbps
smaller values of η, the estimated values of ymax, and con-
sequently the SN transmissions, are conservative (so that
it can meet the low interference requirement of the Primary
Network), which leads to low SN throughput per white space
but low interference to the PU. Second, the analytically com-
puted value PUIP serves as an upper bound for probability
of interference to PU’s transmission (due to secondary trans-
missions) (see Figure 2). Moreover, PUIP for a given η is
always less than or equal to the corresponding η. The pro-
posed theory ensures that the acceptable PU interference
bound is never violated due to SN transmissions. The an-
alytically computed ATHPWS values in Figure 1 matches
reasonably well with the simulation-obtained values for sat-
urated SN traﬃc. For additional results, please refer to [2].
As part of our future work, we plan to do sensitivity anal-
ysis of the proposed scheme with respect to the distribution
parameters, compare the scheme with the other proposed
scheme (such as [1]) and other PU traﬃc proﬁles, and ex-
tend the scheme for multi SN, multi channel scenarios.
