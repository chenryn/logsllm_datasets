It would be nice if the bottom-docked pane (integrated terminal, Output view,
etc.) could optionally appear as a column alongside the editors, instead of
docked to the bottom. My team has a command-line test watcher and node server
that we keep an eye on while developing. Our terminal output tends to be tall
and narrow. A column view or side-docked view would fit better and not cover
vertical space of the editors.
