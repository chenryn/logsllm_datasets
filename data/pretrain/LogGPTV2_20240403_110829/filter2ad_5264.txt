Abstract
An increasing number of countries are passing laws that fa-
cilitate the mass surveillance of their citizens. In response,
governments and citizens are increasingly paying attention
to the countries that their Internet trafﬁc traverses. In some
cases, countries are taking extreme steps, such as building
new IXPs and encouraging local interconnection to keep local
trafﬁc local. We ﬁnd that although many of these efforts are
extensive, they are often futile, due to the inherent lack of
hosting and route diversity for many popular sites. We inves-
tigate how the use of overlay network relays and the DNS
open resolver infrastructure can prevent trafﬁc from traversing
certain jurisdictions.

1 Introduction
When Internet trafﬁc enters a country, it becomes subject to
those countries’ laws. As a result, users have more need
than ever to determine—and control—which countries their
trafﬁc is traversing. As an increasing number of countries
pass laws that facilitate mass surveillance of their citizens [2],
governments and citizens are increasingly motivated to divert
their Internet trafﬁc from countries that perform surveillance
(notably, the United States [1]).
Many countries—notably, Brazil—are taking impressive
measures to reduce the likelihood that Internet trafﬁc tran-
sits the United States [1] including building a 3,500 mile
long ﬁber-optic cable from Fortaleza to Portugal (with no use
of American vendors); pressing companies such as Google,
Facebook, and Twitter (among others) to store data locally;
and switching its dominant email system (Microsoft Outlook)
to a state-developed system called Expresso [1]. Brazil is

also building Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), now has the
largest national ecosystem of public IXPs in the world, and the
number of internationally connected ASes continues to grow.
Brazil is not alone: IXPs are proliferating in eastern Europe,
Africa, and other regions, in part out of a desire to “keep local
trafﬁc local”. Building IXPs alone, of course, cannot guar-
antee that Internet trafﬁc for some service does not enter or
transit a particular country: Internet protocols have no notion
of national borders, and interdomain paths depend in large
part on existing interconnection business relationships (or lack
thereof). In this poster, we present evidence to suggest that
existing Internet hosting and interdomain paths still make it
difﬁcult to avoid certain countries for many popular websites.
Prior work explored how central different countries are to
interdomain routing based on simulated paths and an Inter-
net topology [4]. Our study differs by actively measuring
and analyzing the trafﬁc originating in ﬁve different countries:
Brazil, Netherlands, Kenya, India, and the United States. Us-
ing RIPE Atlas probes and the MaxMind geolocation service,
we measure the country-level trafﬁc paths for the Alexa Top
100 domains in each respective country. Using the current
state of routing as a baseline for comparison, we then measure
how avoidable a given country is to a client in either Brazil,
Netherlands, India, Kenya, or the United States, using open
resolvers and using the overlay network. Our contributions
include:
• The ﬁrst in-depth measurement study of nation-state rout-
ing for Brazil, Netherlands, Kenya, India, and the United
States.
• A preliminary evaluation of how open DNS resolvers and
overlay network relays can help citizens and governments
discover and use paths that avoid certain countries.
We ﬁnd that hosting for many popular websites lacks diversity;
in many cases, even websites that are popular locally are
hosted outside the country where citizens are trying to access
them. For example, more than 50% of the Alexa Top 100
domains in Brazil are hosted in the United States. Internet
paths also lack geographic diversity: About half of the paths
originating in Kenya to the most popular Kenyan websites
traverse the United States or Great Britain. Much of this
phenomenon is due to “tromboning”, whereby an Internet
path starts and ends in a country, yet transits an intermediate
country; for example, about 13% of the paths that we explored
from RIPE Atlas nodes in Brazil to the Alexa Top 100 in
Brazil trombone through the United States. Fortunately, our
567
preliminary results suggest that the use of overlay network
relays to intentionally introduce network detours, and the use
of open DNS resolvers to discover hosting diversity can reduce
tromboning and generally help users select paths that avoid
certain countries.
2 Method
Our measurement study tackles two questions: (1) Which
countries do default Internet routing paths traverse?; (2) What
types of methods can we use to take advantage of hosting and
path diversity to help governments and citizens better control
transnational Internet paths?
The ﬁrst step of our measurement method uses RIPE Atlas
probes in the country of interest to locally resolve each domain
in the Alexa Top 100 and run traceroutes to the IP addresses in
the DNS responses. The measurements were run using Paris
traceroute and each (probe, destination IP) pair was used twice:
once using ICMP traceroute and once using TCP traceroute.
Using MaxMind, each IP address was geolocated at a country
granularity, and with the resulting set of country-level paths,
we analyzed which countries host and/or transit the trafﬁc.
A client can use DNS open resolvers to discover georepli-
cation of a site or service that can facilitate the avoidance of
speciﬁc countries. For example, a client can query an open
DNS resolver in a foreign country to discover a different geo-
replicated instance of a service; this technique (or the use
of EDNS client subnet) can allow the client to discover dif-
ferent replicas of the same service. The path to this newly
discovered replica may assist in avoiding particular countries
(particularly if the client is trying to avoid the country of the
original hosting replica!). The increasing use of IP anycast can
sometimes make this technique insufﬁcient, however, if the
client receives the same IP address regardless of the apparent
origin of the DNS query. Another approach is to use overlay
network relays, which can prevent the client from traversing
an unfavorable country by introducing a path that detours from
the default. Additionally, using relays in the client’s country
can somtimes help keep local trafﬁc local, by exploiting local
paths that BGP does not select by default.
To evaluate the use of open resolvers as a tool for country
avoidance, we query open resolvers in geographically diverse
locations around the world using the Alexa Top 100 domains.
Then we use RIPE Atlas probes to traceroute to the responses,
and map them to country-level paths. To evaluate overlay net-
work relays for country-avoidance, we establish 12 relays in
geographically diverse locations around the world, run tracer-
outes from the country of interest to each relay, as well as
from each relay to the Alexa Top 100 domains. After map-
ping the traceroutes to country-level paths, we measure which
countries are avoidable.
Accurate IP geolocation is challenging, but our study does
not require high-precision geolocation; we are interested in
providing accurate lower bounds on detours at coarse gran-
ularity, and previous work has found that geolocation at a
country-level granularity is more accurate than at ﬁner granu-
larity [3].
3 Preliminary Findings
Hosting diversity. We start by looking at hosting diversity,
more speciﬁcally, how many countries a domain is hosted in.
More diversity should provide for the potential to avoid more
countries. About half of the Alexa Top 100 domains in the
ﬁve countries studied are hosted in more than one country.
Routing diversity. Despite strong efforts made by some coun-
tries, their trafﬁc still traverses surveillance states, and is sub-
ject to surveillance. Over 50% of the Alexa Top 100 domains
in Brazil and India are hosted in the United States, and over
50% of the paths from the Netherlands to the Alexa Top 100
domains transits the United States. About half of Kenyan
trafﬁc traverses the United States and Great Britain.
On the feasiblity of avoidance. By measuring which do-
mains are accessible without traversing a given country using
open resolvers and an overlay network, we see that there are
ways to circumvent unfavorable countries. Without these coun-
try avoidance techniques, Brazilian trafﬁc transitted Spain,
Italy, France, Great Britain, Argentina, Ireland (among others),
but using the overlay network, Brazilian clients could com-
pletely avoid these countries for the top 100 domains. The
overlay network can be used to keep local trafﬁc local; the
percentage of tromboning paths from the United States to the
top 100 domains decreases from 11.2% to 1.3% when relays
are used.
Cause for concern. Unfortunately, some of the more promi-
nent surveillance states are also some of the least avoidable
countries. Most countries are highly dependent on the United
States, a known surveillance state, and not dependent on other
countries. Neither Brazil, India, Kenya, or the Netherlands
can completely avoid the United States with the country avoid-
ance techniques. With the overlay network, both Brazilian
and Netherlands paths avoid the United States about 65% of
the time, and the United States is completely unavoidable for
about 10% of the paths because it is the only country where
the content is hosted. Kenyan trafﬁc can only avoid the United
States on about 40% of the paths from Kenya to the top 100
domains. On the other hand, the United States can avoid every
other country except for France and the Netherlands, and even
then they are avoidable for 99% of the top 100 domains.
