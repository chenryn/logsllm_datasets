User: Is it possible to set up a virtualenv on a Dropbox folder from a Mac and activate that from Ubuntu that also has access to that Dropbox folder?
I seem to be able to call source env/bin/activate and it activates the environment, but when I call which python, it gives me /usr/bin/python instead of the one in the virtual environment
Before I do anymore troubleshooting/add more details, is this possible at all and am I just doing something wrong or is this not possible?
Assistant: It's not possible, because virtualenv use absolute paths to setup the environment.
Also it's kind of the reverse of what virtualenv is created for.
