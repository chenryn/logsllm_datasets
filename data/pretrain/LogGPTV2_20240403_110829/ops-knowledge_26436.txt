User: I'm implementing a WebSocket server using Python and Autobahn (something that builds off of Twisted). What's the best way to let my Autobahn/Twisted server know that something has happened from within my Django application?
More specifically, I'm implementing a notifications service and instant update service that automatically let's my client side application know when things have changed and what it needs to update.
Is there any way to allow Django to "publish" to my Twisted server and then update the client side? I'm not really sure how this should all look.
Thanks
Assistant: There are dozens or hundreds of ways to do inter-process communication.  For example, you could use HTTP by running an HTTP server in one process and using an HTTP client in the other.
The specific choice of protocol probably doesn't matter a whole lot.  The particular details of the kind of communication you need might suggest one protocol over the others.  If the extent of your requirements are just to provide notification that "something has happened" then a very simple protocol will probably do the job just fine.
