ABSTRACT
Recently, traffic engineering mechanisms have been developed that
guarantee that a network (cloud provider WAN, or ISP) does not
experience congestion under failures. In this paper, we show that
existing congestion-free mechanisms, notably FFC, achieve perfor-
mance far short of the network’s intrinsic capability. We propose
PCF, a set of novel congestion-free mechanisms to bridge this gap.
PCF achieves these goals by better modeling network structure, and
by carefully enhancing the flexibility of network response while en-
suring that the performance under failures can be tractably modeled.
All of PCF’s schemes involve relatively light-weight operations on
failures, and many of them can be realized using a local propor-
tional routing scheme similar to FFC. We show PCF’s effectiveness
through formal theoretical results, and empirical experiments over
21 Internet topologies. PCF’s schemes provably out-perform FFC,
and in practice, can sustain higher throughput than FFC by a factor
of 1.11X to 1.5X on average across the topologies, while providing
a benefit of 2.6X in some cases.

1 INTRODUCTION
Failures are the norm in both ISP networks [27, 35], and cloud
provider WANs [12, 14, 30]. Yet networks must ensure that the
increasingly stringent performance requirements of business criti-
cal applications are met [18]. Many recent works [17, 20, 23] have
developed flexible ways of routing traffic motivated by the goal of
efficiently utilizing network capacity. However, with these schemes,
the network could experience congestion on failure [26].

Motivated by these challenges, the research community has re-
cently designed traffic engineering mechanisms that proactively
ensure that the network is congestion-free (i.e., ensure that no
link carries more traffic than its capacity) under typical failure
scenarios [26, 32, 37]. For instance, FFC [26], a representative and
state-of-the-art approach, allocates bandwidth to flows so that no
congestion occurs when 𝑓 or fewer links fail. To do so, FFC splits
traffic from each ingress to egress along a set of pre-specified tun-
nels.
In this paper, we explore the performance of such congestion-
free mechanisms relative to the performance that a network could
achieve by responding optimally to each failure. We refer to the
performance achieved when the network responds optimally as the
intrinsic network capability. We make two contributions.
First, we show that congestion-free schemes perform much
worse than optimal, and present deeper insights into the underlying
reasons. In particular, we show that (i) FFC is not only conservative,
but also its performance can degrade with an increase in the number
of tunnels; and (ii) the performance of FFC can be arbitrarily worse
than optimal, even when exponentially many tunnels are used. We
show that these results arise because (i) FFC models network struc-
ture in a coarse fashion; and (ii) reservations are tightly coupled to
paths, and the failure of a link leads to unutilized capacity on other
links in the tunnel that contain the failed link.
Second, we propose PCF (Provably Congestion-free and resilient
Flexible routing), a set of novel mechanisms that ensure the net-
work is provably congestion-free under failures, while performing
closer to the network’s intrinsic capability. PCF achieves these goals
by better modeling network structure, and through more flexible
response strategies. The key challenge that PCF addresses is how
to enhance the flexibility of network response while ensuring that
the performance under failures can be tractably modeled.
We develop multiple mechanisms as part of PCF that allow the
architect to trade-off the achievable performance guarantee with
deployment complexity. First, we present an alternate approach
for bandwidth allocation with the FFC response mechanism which
(i) results in a better performance guarantee; and (ii) ensures the
allocation does not degrade with additional tunnels. Second, we
explore more flexible network response based on an abstraction that
we term logical sequence (LS). A LS from a source to a destination
traverses a series of logical segments (formally defined in §3.3). The
reservation on any LS for a targeted failure set is guaranteed by
the logical segments constituting the sequence. Each segment may
recursively route traffic over other LSs or physical tunnels servicing
that segment. This allows for significant flexibility in how traffic
is routed over various segments, and which nodes respond to a
given failure. LSs are loosely inspired by ideas such as segment
routing [16, 34] though with significant differences (§6). We show
that when LSs are used, the performance can be arbitrarily better
than FFC. We develop several mechanisms based on LSs, including

those that provably out-perform R3 [37], another congestion-free
mechanism.
We show how PCF’s mechanisms can be implemented in practice.
For example, we show that when LSs are chosen with some restric-
tions, they can be realized by a simple generalization of the local
proportional routing scheme used by FFC. When LSs are arbitrar-
ily chosen (which allows for even better performance guarantees),
our approach discovers a viable routing using techniques that are
lighter weight than the the optimal network response strategy.
Empirical evaluations of PCF over 21 topologies from the Internet
Topology Zoo show that PCF significantly out-performs FFC. PCF’s
schemes can sustain higher throughput than FFC by a factor of
1.11X to 1.5X on average across the topologies, while providing a
benefit of 2.6X in some cases.
2 MOTIVATION
A critical task for network architects is to ensure that their network
designs can sustain desired traffic over a target set of failures [26,
32, 37]. This in turn depends on the mechanisms that the network
uses to respond to failures.
To illustrate these issues, consider tunnel-based forwarding [23,
26, 33], where traffic from each ingress to egress is carried over a set
of pre-selected tunnels. When a tunnel is no longer available (e.g.,
due to the failure of an underlying link), then, traffic is redistributed
across the surviving tunnels. Redistributing traffic can potentially
overload some links. A congestion-free routing mechanism guar-
antees that the network has been proactively designed so no link
would be over-loaded over a desired set of failures [26, 32, 37].
FFC [26] is a recent and representative approach set in the con-
text of tunnel-based forwarding. Consider a network where each
pair of nodes (𝑠, 𝑡) is associated with a traffic demand 𝑑𝑠𝑡, and
a set of tunnels 𝑇 (𝑠, 𝑡) to route the traffic. FFC seeks to assign a
bandwidth 𝑏𝑤𝑠𝑡 to each node pair such that this bandwidth can
be guaranteed under all possible 𝑓 simultaneous link failures. To
achieve this, FFC reserves bandwidth on each tunnel, and ensures
that the total reservation on all tunnels in 𝑇 (𝑠, 𝑡) exceeds 𝑏𝑤𝑠𝑡
under every failure scenario of interest. We present examples to
illustrate why FFC is conservative.
Coarse modeling of network structure. Consider Fig. 1 where
the goal is to carry the maximum amount of traffic possible from 𝑠
to 𝑡, while tolerating any possible single link failure. If the network
could respond optimally for each failure scenario (by running an
optimal multi-commodity flow for that scenario), it is easy to ver-
ify that the network is intrinsically capable of carrying 2 units of
flow from 𝑠 to 𝑡 under all possible single link failures. When FFC
is used, the results depend on the set of tunnels considered. We
consider two schemes: (i) FFC-4 (all 4 tunnels 𝑙1 to 𝑙4 are used);
and (ii) FFC-3 (only 3 tunnels 𝑙1 to 𝑙3 are used). Fig. 2 shows that
both schemes perform worse than optimal, and surprisingly, FFC-4
performs worse.
We now explain why FFC is conservative, and why its perfor-
mance may degrade with more tunnels. FFC uses a parameter 𝑝𝑠𝑡
which denotes the maximum number of tunnels between 𝑠 and 𝑡
that share a common link. When designing to tolerate 𝑓 link fail-
ures, FFC conservatively assumes that upto 𝑓 𝑝𝑠𝑡 tunnels may fail,
and plans a reservation that can tolerate all possible failures of
𝑓 𝑝𝑠𝑡 tunnels. In Fig. 1, when FFC uses all 4 tunnels, 𝑝𝑠𝑡 is 2. Hence,
when designing for single link failures, FFC-4 plans for all possible
combinations of two tunnel failures. This is conservative because
tunnels 𝑙1 and 𝑙2 do not fail together under single link failures.
With FFC-3, all tunnels are disjoint, and 𝑝𝑠𝑡 = 1. Hence, FFC-3 only
needs to be consider single tunnel failures. However, FFC-3 still
cannot match the optimal since it cannot tap into the capacity of
links 𝑠 − 4 and 4 − 3.
Fig. 2 also shows that if all two link failures must be tolerated,
the throughput with the optimal, FFC-3, and FFC-4 are 1, 0.5, and
0 respectively. The reasons are similar – FFC-4 can only service
traffic that can survive 𝑝𝑠𝑡 𝑓 = 2 × 2 = 4 tunnel failures, and hence
cannot carry any traffic, while FFC-3 only needs to consider all 2
tunnel failure scenarios.
Limitations of tunnel reservations. A second issue with FFC
is that it is inherently limited by the fact that reservations are made
at the granularity of entire tunnels. To illustrate this, consider Fig. 3.
It is easy to verify that if the network responds optimally, it can
carry 2/3 units of traffic from 𝑠 to 𝑡 under any single link failure.
Unfortunately, FFC can only achieve an optimal of 1/2. In §3.3,
we will further generalize this example to show that FFC can see
arbitrarily poor performance relative to optimal.
Tunnel-based allocation does not perform as well as optimal
because reservations are made on all links of a tunnel, and when a
link fails, the reservations on other links of that tunnel go unutilized.
For example, consider a tunnel 𝑙 that traverses links 𝑒1 and 𝑒4. When
𝑒4 (and hence the tunnel 𝑙) fails, FFC only uses the reservations
on the remaining tunnels, and the reservation on 𝑒1 for the failed
tunnel 𝑙 goes unutilized. In contrast, the optimal approach is able
to use all capacity on all the non-failed links.
In Fig. 3, let 𝑇4 and 𝑇5 respectively denote the set of tunnels from
𝑠 to 𝑡 that use 𝑒4 and 𝑒5. Let 𝑟4 and 𝑟5 denote FFC’s reservations
on each of these sets of tunnels. FFC can carry at most 𝑟5 units of
traffic when 𝑒4 fails, and at most 𝑟4 units when 𝑒5 fails. Thus, FFC
can guarantee at most min(𝑟4, 𝑟5) traffic from 𝑠 to 𝑡 over all single
link failures. However, min{𝑟4, 𝑟5} × 2 ≤ 𝑟4 + 𝑟5 ≤ 1, where the
second inequality is because tunnels in 𝑇 4 and 𝑇 5 must reserve
capacity in one of the links 𝑒1, 𝑒2, or 𝑒3, whose combined capacity
is 1 unit. Hence, FFC can carry at most 0.5 units of traffic from 𝑠 to
𝑡.
3 PCF OVERVIEW
PCF’s primary goal is to bridge the gap between existing congestion-
free routing mechanisms, and intrinsic network capability. PCF
tackles the issues raised in §2 by better modeling, and adopting
more flexible response strategies.
Unfortunately, not all routing strategies are amenable to formal
guarantees on worst-case performance under failures. For instance,
when the network responds with an optimal multi-commodity flow
(the most flexible response), the problem of determining the worst-
