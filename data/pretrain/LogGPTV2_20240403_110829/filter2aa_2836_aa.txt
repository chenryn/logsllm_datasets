Phase 0: Preparations
Make sure the station to be converted is in good working order on its original 
frequencies before attempting conversion to Amateur Radio use. Note that a Fault light 
on the Receiver Synthesizer Module may be the result of a missing External Reference 
Source. Verify in programming software and set source to internal if that is the case.
About 90% of the screws in the MASTR-III T/R Frame are Torx T-15. The remaining are 
T-6, T-8, T-10 or Phillips #2.
To tune the Receiver Front End module properly, I recommend access to a service 
monitor with a spectrum analyzer (HP-8920 series, IFR-1600S or similar). It is possible 
to use a signal generator and a frequency selective RF volt meter, or service monitor 
with simultaneous generate and receive but not as easy as you can’t see where the 
peaks and dips are.
You will need to acquire a copy of TQ-3353 Mastr-IIe, III Programming Software 
(M2E.BAT, M3.BAT). This should also come with TQ-0619 (MASTRUTL.BAT) A copy is 
available here. [MASTR2E3.ZIP]
Full Modification requires a great deal of surface mount soldering. You will need a 
quality soldering Iron. I use a Weller with a 800 degree Tip R. Also needed is fine 
diameter solder, 0.015”, and fine tweezers.
You will also need thicker gauge solder and a brute force tip for modification of the 
tuning slugs. I recommend 2% silver solder for use here.
Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming
Please Refer to LBI38540D
Connection to the repeater is done with a straight through DB-9 RS-232 cable. Connect 
either to the Data Port on the front of the repeater or the DB-9 connection on the rear of 
the interface board.
MASTRUTL.BAT is used as a utility to verify station operation and to set potentiometer 
values. 
You will use this application to set the repeat audio levels and transmitter power output. 
It can also help diagnose the repeater to a degree with the ability to convey that one or 
more modules are malfunctioning.
M2E.BAT and M3.BAT are designed to change the station operating parameters, such 
as CTCSS tones, hang times and in the case of the MASTR-III the operating 
frequencies.
It is important that the software be in MASTR-III mode. Programming the repeater with 
the software in M2e mode may inadvertently brick the System Module requiring 
replacement. Start the software with M3.BAT. Be sure the screen looks like above with 
the ‘MASTR-III Control Shelf Programming’ at the top.
This software has some compatibility issues as it is an older DOS based program. A PIII 
tablet with a USB to RS-232 adapter and WinXP would not program, but a PII laptop 
with a hardware based serial port and WinXP would.
Read and save the current configuration. Use F6. Read it twice, once as a backup then 
the other as the file you will be editing.
Once that is done highlight the file you will be editing and hit F2. Edit the data to your 
new operating parameters. Use F9 over any field to get a description of what it adjusts. 
For some reason ‘space’ is not an allowed character when programming the morse 
code ID so don’t pull your hair out. Once done save the data by pressing F10 and then 
F1 and confirm the over write.
Send programming data to the repeater by pressing F5 and selecting the file you just 
edited.
The Fault LEDs on the Transmitter and Receiver synthesizer modules should now be lit 
as the PLLs are no longer able to lock. There may be a slight flicker on the LEDs as the 
System Module will be attempting to reset the synthesizers until the Fault clears.
Phase 2: VHF Transmitter Synthesizer Module
Please Refer to LBI38640B
Remove the Transmitter Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame.  Using a small straight 
jeweler’s screwdriver or ‘greenie’ and a flashlight, adjust the dip switches through the 
access hole in the cover of the module to the following configuration:
Position 1: Open
Position 2: Closed
Position 3: Open
Position 4: Open
Leave positions 5 and 6 as is.
Replace the card back into the T/R frame. Put the station into transmit mode and notice 
that the Fault LED should no longer be lit.
It is not necessary to remove the cover of the module for adjustment, but doing so 
allows easier access.
With a spectrum analyzer verify the output of the module to be approximately 15 mW 
(11.5 dBm). 
Phase 3: VHF Receiver Synthesizer Module
Please Refer to LBI38641B
Please note that the Group 1 (136 – 151 MHz) Synthesizer generates high side Local 
Oscillator injection where as the G2 generates low side. The output frequency of the 
Receiver Synthesizer Module will be Receive Frequency + 21.4 MHz. i.e. 146.04 MHz + 
21.4 MHz = 167.44 MHz.
Remove the Receiver Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame and remove the top 
cover. Flip the card over and remove the 6 screws that hold the RF shielding sub frame 
around the VCO section. 
If you want full Group 1 conversion, replace the Group 2 components to the G1 
specifications as found in the manual.  A few component changes are all that is 
necessary for Amateur Radio service.
Remove C2. Replace C1 with a 6pF NPO 0805 Capacitor or equivalent. Keep the 
original C1 and C2 should replacement be necessary, use a piece of Scotch tape and a 
sharpie to label each one. Replace the VCO RF shielding but not the module shield. 
You will now have to remove the Receiver Front End Module and IF Module from the 
T/R frame so you can access the tuning adjustments of the VCO.
Tuning can be done two ways. The first is place the Synthesizer back into the T/R frame 
and adjust the VCO capacitor, C52 with a ‘greenie’ until the Fault LED extinguishes. 
‘Center’ the capacitors tuning range by adjusting C52 and noting where Fault lights and 
split the difference.
The second method requires a couple of jumpers be installed first. Solder a wire jumper 
between U14 pin 11 (V_Tune) and +5 found at U15 pin 3. Next install a small wire lead 
between (Enable Test) found on R86 and Ground found on C65, Use the pads closest 
to each other. Insert the module into the T/R frame and connect a frequency counter to 
LO Output. Adjust C52 for proper LO frequency. Remove jumpers.
Using a quality frequency counter on LO Output and adjust the trimmer on Y1 until the 
desired LO frequency reads true. This method offers greater error and thus precision 
then looking at the 12.8MHz Reference Output.
Once tuned remove the module from the frame again and replace RF shield. Insert the 
module back into frame. Verify VCO lock by Fault LED being extinguished. Power cycle 
the repeater leaving it off for 1 minute and check that the PLL lock took. The fault LED 
should stay lit for approx 5 seconds and go out.
I find the Group 2 Low Pass Filter on the output is better designed than the Group 1, 
offering 3dB more rejection of the second harmonic so no changes were made here.
With a spectrum analyzer verify the output of the module to be approximately 1 mW (0 
dBm), Also verify that the harmonics are at least 29dB below carrier.
