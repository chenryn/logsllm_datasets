### Phase 0: Preparations

Before attempting the conversion to Amateur Radio use, ensure the station is in good working order on its original frequencies. A Fault light on the Receiver Synthesizer Module may indicate a missing External Reference Source. Verify this in the programming software and set the source to internal if necessary.

Approximately 90% of the screws in the MASTR-III T/R Frame are Torx T-15. The remaining screws are T-6, T-8, T-10, or Phillips #2.

For proper tuning of the Receiver Front End module, it is recommended to have access to a service monitor with a spectrum analyzer (e.g., HP-8920 series, IFR-1600S). While it is possible to use a signal generator and a frequency selective RF volt meter, or a service monitor with simultaneous generate and receive capabilities, these methods are less precise as they do not provide visual feedback on peaks and dips.

You will need a copy of TQ-3353 Mastr-IIe, III Programming Software (M2E.BAT, M3.BAT), which should also include TQ-0619 (MASTRUTL.BAT). A copy is available here: [MASTR2E3.ZIP].

Full modification requires extensive surface mount soldering. You will need a quality soldering iron, such as a Weller with an 800-degree Tip R, fine diameter solder (0.015"), and fine tweezers. Additionally, thicker gauge solder and a brute force tip are required for modifying the tuning slugs. It is recommended to use 2% silver solder for this purpose.

### Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming

**Reference:** LBI38540D

Connect to the repeater using a straight-through DB-9 RS-232 cable. Connect either to the Data Port on the front of the repeater or the DB-9 connection on the rear of the interface board.

**Software Usage:**

- **MASTRUTL.BAT**: This utility verifies station operation and sets potentiometer values. Use it to set repeat audio levels and transmitter power output. It can also help diagnose the repeater by identifying malfunctioning modules.
- **M2E.BAT and M3.BAT**: These programs change the station's operating parameters, such as CTCSS tones, hang times, and, in the case of the MASTR-III, the operating frequencies.

Ensure the software is in MASTR-III mode. Programming the repeater in M2e mode may inadvertently "brick" the System Module, requiring replacement. Start the software with M3.BAT and verify that the screen displays 'MASTR-III Control Shelf Programming' at the top.

This software has some compatibility issues due to its DOS-based nature. For example, a PIII tablet with a USB to RS-232 adapter and Windows XP did not work, but a PII laptop with a hardware-based serial port and Windows XP did.

**Steps:**

1. Read and save the current configuration using F6. Perform this step twice: once as a backup and once as the file you will edit.
2. Highlight the file you will edit and press F2. Edit the data to your new operating parameters. Press F9 over any field to get a description of what it adjusts.
3. Note that the space character is not allowed when programming the Morse code ID.
4. Save the data by pressing F10, then F1, and confirm the overwrite.
5. Send the programming data to the repeater by pressing F5 and selecting the file you just edited.
6. The Fault LEDs on the Transmitter and Receiver synthesizer modules should now be lit as the PLLs are no longer able to lock. There may be a slight flicker on the LEDs as the System Module attempts to reset the synthesizers until the Fault clears.

### Phase 2: VHF Transmitter Synthesizer Module

**Reference:** LBI38640B

1. Remove the Transmitter Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame.
2. Using a small straight jeweler’s screwdriver or 'greenie' and a flashlight, adjust the dip switches through the access hole in the cover of the module to the following configuration:
   - Position 1: Open
   - Position 2: Closed
   - Position 3: Open
   - Position 4: Open
   - Positions 5 and 6: As is
3. Replace the card back into the T/R frame.
4. Put the station into transmit mode and verify that the Fault LED is no longer lit.
5. It is not necessary to remove the cover of the module for adjustment, but doing so allows easier access.
6. With a spectrum analyzer, verify the output of the module to be approximately 15 mW (11.5 dBm).

### Phase 3: VHF Receiver Synthesizer Module

**Reference:** LBI38641B

**Note:** The Group 1 (136 – 151 MHz) Synthesizer generates high-side Local Oscillator injection, while the Group 2 (G2) generates low-side. The output frequency of the Receiver Synthesizer Module will be Receive Frequency + 21.4 MHz. For example, 146.04 MHz + 21.4 MHz = 167.44 MHz.

1. Remove the Receiver Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame and remove the top cover.
2. Flip the card over and remove the 6 screws that hold the RF shielding subframe around the VCO section.
3. For full Group 1 conversion, replace the Group 2 components with G1 specifications as found in the manual. A few component changes are necessary for Amateur Radio service.
4. Remove C2. Replace C1 with a 6pF NPO 0805 Capacitor or equivalent. Keep the original C1 and C2 for potential replacement, and label them with Scotch tape and a sharpie.
5. Replace the VCO RF shielding but not the module shield.
6. Remove the Receiver Front End Module and IF Module from the T/R frame to access the VCO tuning adjustments.

**Tuning Methods:**

- **Method 1:**
  1. Place the Synthesizer back into the T/R frame.
  2. Adjust the VCO capacitor, C52, with a 'greenie' until the Fault LED extinguishes.
  3. 'Center' the capacitors tuning range by adjusting C52 and noting where the Fault lights, then split the difference.

- **Method 2:**
  1. Solder a wire jumper between U14 pin 11 (V_Tune) and +5 found at U15 pin 3.
  2. Install a small wire lead between (Enable Test) found on R86 and Ground found on C65, using the pads closest to each other.
  3. Insert the module into the T/R frame and connect a frequency counter to LO Output.
  4. Adjust C52 for the proper LO frequency.
  5. Remove the jumpers.
  6. Using a quality frequency counter on LO Output, adjust the trimmer on Y1 until the desired LO frequency reads true. This method offers greater precision than looking at the 12.8MHz Reference Output.

Once tuned, remove the module from the frame again and replace the RF shield. Insert the module back into the frame and verify VCO lock by ensuring the Fault LED is extinguished. Power cycle the repeater, leaving it off for 1 minute, and check that the PLL lock took. The fault LED should stay lit for approximately 5 seconds and then go out.

The Group 2 Low Pass Filter on the output is better designed than the Group 1, offering 3dB more rejection of the second harmonic, so no changes are necessary here.

With a spectrum analyzer, verify the output of the module to be approximately 1 mW (0 dBm). Also, verify that the harmonics are at least 29dB below the carrier.
