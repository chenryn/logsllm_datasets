Table 17: Conversion from purpose classes in MobiPurpose [33] to PurPliance taxonomy. This table does not present full
PurPliance taxonomy but relevant classes with ones in MobiPurpose.
Figure 6: Data statistics of 1,727,001 network requests intercepted. The left figure shows the distribution of requests among
domains. The right figure shows the distribution of requests among app categories on Google Play.
PurPliance extracted 160 statements from 68 sentences which are
88% more statements and cover 45% more sentences than PolicyLint.
Table 11 shows our experimental results.
An in-depth analysis shows the most common incorrect extrac-
tion of both systems is caused by the erroneous recognition of
data objects and receivers by NER models. Furthermore, since both
systems do not analyze the semantics of sentences, they extract
data-collection practices from non-data-collection statements such
as "data protection laws in Europe distinguish between organiza-
tions that process personal data ..." However, both systems employ
further filtering in the later steps of their pipelines so trivial incor-
rectness would not increase false positive rates of the whole system
significantly.
PurPliance extracts more statements than PolicyLint because
it can cover many grammar variations which are not included in
PolicyLint’s 16 sentence templates of data collection and sharing.
For example, PolicyLint missed all policy statements from "we do
not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personal
identifiable information," because it did not recognize the long list
of multiple data action verbs.
