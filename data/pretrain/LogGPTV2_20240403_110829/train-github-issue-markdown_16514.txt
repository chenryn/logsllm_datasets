Somewhere between all the convert things to OO and restructure gallery PRs,
the pyplot section of the gallery now has very little pyplot content:
### PyPlot
  * plot() format string
  * Pyplot mathtext
  * Pyplot simple
  * Pyplot text
  * Pyplot three
  * Pyplot two subplots
### OO
  * Align y-labels
  * Annotate Transform
  * Annotate a plot
  * Annotate Polar
  * Auto Subplots Adjust
  * Boxplot Demo
  * Dollar Ticks
  * Fig Axes Customize Simple
  * Simple Axes labels
  * Adding lines to figures
  * Text Commands
  * Text Layout
  * what's new examples in #15920
I think there should be a standalone pyplot only gallery page, but think for
this PR a potential resolution would be to sort the OO examples into the
correct sections (possibly combining them with existing content) or altogether
remove them if they're not adding any information.
xref: #15355 because I think this contributes to some of the confusion
discussed there.
