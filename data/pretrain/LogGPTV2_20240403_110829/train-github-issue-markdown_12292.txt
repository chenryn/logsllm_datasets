#### Describe the bug
My TSLint gives an error (see screenshot) after upgrading from 0.21.4 to
0.23.0 axios.
#### To Reproduce
If in `AxiosPromise` you pass any value other than `unknown`, then TSLint
throws an error. For example, if I receive a {name: string} object in
response, then I cannot use the interface to specify this in `AxiosPromise`.
#### Expected behavior
I would like to pass the response interface if I know exactly what to expect.
#### Environment
  * Axios Version 0.23.0
  * Node.js Version 16.9.0
