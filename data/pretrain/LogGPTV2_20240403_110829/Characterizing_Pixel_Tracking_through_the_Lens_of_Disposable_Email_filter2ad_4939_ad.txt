To set the threshold t for tracking pixels, we plot Figure 3
to show the image size distribution in our dataset. Image size
is deﬁned as the larger value between the height and width.
As shown in Figure 3, there is a clear peak where the image
size is 1 (1.1 million images). There are also 60K images of
a “zero” size. To be conservative, we set the threshold t = 1.
Our method is still not perfect, since we might miss trackers
that use bigger tracking images. The detection result is only a
lower-bound of all possible tracking.
Alternative Tracking Methods.
In addition to the methods
above, we have tested other alternative methods, which did not
return positive results in our pilot test. For completeness, we
brieﬂy discuss them too. First, other than URL parameters,
trackers use subdomain names to carry the user identiﬁers.
For example, a tracker (e.g., tracker.com) may register
many subdomains, and use each subdomain to represent a user
(e.g., u1.tracker.com, u2.tracker.com). To look for
such trackers, we sort the domain names of image URLs
based on their number of subdomains. We only ﬁnd 3 domain
names (list-manage.com, sendgrid.com and emltrk.com) that
have more than 1000 subdomains. However, we ﬁnd that they
are not using subdomain names as user identiﬁers. Instead,
each subdomain is assigned to represent a “customer” that
adopted their tracking services. For example, a tracking URL
office-artist.us12.list-manage.com is used by
online service office-artist.com to track their users.
We have examined all the tracking domains with over 50
subdomains and did not ﬁnd any subdomain-based tracking.
A limitation of step-1 and step-2 is that they cannot cap-
ture trackers that use a random string as the identiﬁer. An
alternative approach is cluster image URLs that follow the
same templates. Then the differences in the URLs are likely
to be the unique user identiﬁers. However, our pilot
test
shows that the majority of the differences in image URLs
are indeed personalized content, but the personalized content
is not for tracking. For example, online services often send

product recommendations using the same template but use
different “ProductIDs” in the image URLs. This approach
easily introduces false positives.
Third-party Tracking.
To differentiate ﬁrst-party and
third-party tracking, we match the domain name of the email
sender and that of the image URL. Since we use domain name
to perform the matching, all the “subdomains” belong to the
same party. For example, mail.A.com and image.A.com
match with each other since they share the same domain name.
If the email sender’s domain name is different from that of
the image tracking URL, we then check their WHOIS record
to make sure the two domains are not owned by the same
organization. We regard the tracking as a third-party tracking
if the two domain names belong to different organizations.
VI. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
We apply our detection method to the 2.3 million emails,
and the results are summarized in Table VI. In total, we
extracted 3.9 million unique image URLs and 1.2 million of
them (31.5%) are identiﬁed as tracking links. These tracking
links are embedded in 573K emails (24.6%). Out of the 210K
email sender domains, we ﬁnd that 11.6K of them (5.5%)
have embedded the tracking pixels in their emails. In total,
we identify 13,563 unique tracker domains. In the following,
we ﬁrst characterize different email tracking techniques and
the “hidden trackers”. Then we focus on third-party tracking
and identify the top trackers. Finally, we analyze how different
online services perform tracking.

A. Email Tracking Techniques
As shown in Table VI, there is almost an equal number of
tracking URLs that send plaintext user identiﬁers (200,682)
and those that send obfuscated identiﬁers (200,247). For the
obfuscated tracking, we ﬁnd 12 obfuscated methods are used
by trackers (out of 992 obfuscations tested). As shown in
Table VII, MD5 is applied in the vast majority of these
tracking URLs (91.7%) followed by Base64 (4.9%). We did
ﬁnd cases where the obfuscation functions are applied more
than once but these cases are rare (<0.5%). This observation
is consistent with the previous smaller-scale study [17].
There are even more tracking links that use invisible pixels.
We ﬁnd 548,166 invisible HTML pixels where the HTML
size attributes are 1×1 or smaller or the image tags are
set to be “hidden”. Meanwhile, we ﬁnd 537,266 additional
invisible remote pixels which falsely claim their HTML size
attributes even though the actual image is 1×1. By analyzing
the HTML attributes of the invisible remote pixels, we ﬁnd
that 20% of them did not specify the size attributes. For the
remaining images that speciﬁed the size, Figure 4 shows the
size distribution. These pixels declare much larger image sizes
in HTML (possibly to avoid detection) while the actual image
is only 1×1 (invisible to users).
Figure 5 shows the overlaps of the tracking URLs detected
by different methods. We ﬁnd 17K (8.6%) the plaintext track-
ing URLs are also using invisible HTML pixels; 114K (56.8%)
plaintext tracking URLs are using invisible remote pixels. This
suggests that trackers prefer stealthier methods when sending
plaintext identiﬁers. For obfuscated tracking URLs, although
the “remote” invisible pixels are still preferred (86K, 42.7%),
the ratio is more balanced compared to the usage of HTML
pixels (47K, 23.3%). When the parameters are obfuscated, the
trackers are likely to put in less effort towards hiding their
tracking pixels.
Hidden Trackers.
Through our analysis, we ﬁnd hidden
trackers when we try to fetch the tracking pixels from the
remote servers. More speciﬁcally, when we request the images,
the request will be ﬁrst sent to the “direct tracker” (based on
the image URL) and then redirected to the “hidden trackers”.
The hidden trackers are not directly visible in the email body
and can only be reached through HTTP/HTTPS redirections.
In this way, user identiﬁers are not only leaked to the direct
tracker but also to the hidden trackers in real time. Intuitively,

hidden trackers are less likely to be blacklisted (by adblockers)
since they do not directly appear in the HTML. To capture
hidden trackers, we crawled all of the 1,222,961 tracking
URLs. We ﬁnd that a large number of the tracking URLs
have redirections (616,535, 50.4%). In total, we obtain 2,825
unique hidden tracker domains. Table VIII shows the top 10
hidden trackers (ranked by the number of the direct trackers
that redirect trafﬁc to them).
Hidden trackers may also act as direct trackers in certain
emails. We ﬁnd that 2,607 hidden trackers have once appeared
to be direct trackers in out dataset. In total, hidden trackers
are associated with 112,068 emails and 2260 sender domains
(19.3% of sender domains that adopted tracking). Interestingly,
many ﬁrst-party tracking links also share the user information
with hidden trackers in real-time. More speciﬁcally, there are
9,553 emails (220 sender domains) that share user identiﬁers
to a hidden tracker while performing ﬁrst-party tracking.
B. Third-party Tracking
Next, we focus on third-party tracking and identify the top
trackers. This analysis is only applicable to emails that contain
a sender address (1.2 million emails).
Overall Statistics.
Third-party tracking is highly prevalent.
As shown in Table VI, there are 149k emails with third-party
tracking. Interestingly, there are more sender domains with
third-party tracking (7,398) than those with ﬁrst-party tracking
(5,403). In total, we identify 2,302 third-party trackers.
Figure 6 breaks-down the tracking methods used by ﬁrst-
and third-party trackers. To make sure different tracking meth-
ods don’t overlap, we present plaintext tracking and obfuscated
tracking, and regard the rest of the invisible pixel tracking as
