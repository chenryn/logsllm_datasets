**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.7
**Code**
    function func(val: "Test") {
        console.log(val);
    }
    func("Test");
**Expected behavior:**  
Should work normally and print "Test".
**Actual behavior:**  
A compile-time error is reported (highlighting `func`):
    A signature with an implementation cannot use a string literal type.

In my code I had a function that accepted an argument with a type including
only two possible string literal values: say `"Value1"` and `"Value2"`, e.g
`function func(val: "Value1" | "Value2")`, which worked OK. At some point I
decided that "Value2" should not yet be supported so I removed it as an
option. This left me with a unary string literal type, e.g. `function
func(val: "Value1")`, but the compiler doesn't seem to like it?
