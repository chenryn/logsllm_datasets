User: When we deploy a high-availability architecture, we need to perform a failover test to ensure that automatic failover can be performed in a timely manner in the event of a hardware failure or software failure. Design a failover test plan, and fill in the test report in the actual test, including the test process, test results and optimization suggestions.
Assistant: Failover test plan 1. Test objective: Verify that the high-availability architecture can automatically switch over when a failure occurs, to ensure that the system can return to normal in a timely manner. 2. Test environment: Build a high-availability architecture, including multiple nodes and corresponding load balancers, as well as monitoring and alarm systems. 3. Test steps: ·Simulate hardware failure: simulate hardware failure on a certain node, such as power failure, network card failure, etc. ·Simulate software faults: Simulate software faults on a certain node, such as program crashes, database connection timeouts, etc. ·Observe failover: After a failure occurs, monitor the switching process to ensure that the failover is successful and the recovery time does not exceed a certain threshold. ·Verify system function: after failover, test whether the function of the system is normal, such as access speed, data correctness, etc. ·Record test results: record test results, including fault type, fault recovery time and switching process. 4. Test report: During the test, we simulated hardware and software failures, and verified that the system can automatically switch when a failure occurs, and the recovery time does not exceed 5 minutes. During the switching process, the load balancer can automatically forward the request to the standby node to ensure that the external services of the system are not interrupted. The test results showed that the system was able to operate normally after the failover, and there was no data loss or erroneous data. Optimization suggestion: In the test, it is found that the recovery speed of the system after failover is relatively slow, so it is recommended to add more backup nodes in the high availability architecture to speed up the failure recovery speed. At the same time, it is recommended to add a monitoring and alarm system so that the operator can be notified in time to deal with it when a failure occurs.
