will move an end user base from one interface on a Cable modem
termination system (CMTS) to another, triggering a renumbering of
addresses. If DHCP is used to assign addresses, there is a standard
procedure for doing so described in RFC 3203 [30], which defines
the DHCP message FORCERENEW, which can be used for “Network
renumbering: Under tightly controlled conditions, the FORCERE-
NEW procedures can be used to brute force the renumbering of
entire subnets, client per client, under control of a DHCP server.”
7 TOWARDS DISTILLING OUTAGES
FROM DISRUPTIONS
Next, we study features of disruptions to determine to what extent
it is possible to distinguish disruptions that reflect actual service
outages vs. disruptions as result of prefix migration. We do so on a
per-network level, and on the level of individual disruption events.
7.1 Network-Based Discrimination
Here we expand the per-AS classification begun in Section 6, which
introduced the correlation of the time series of number of disrupted
IP addresses versus anti-disrupted addresses. In addition to the
correlation, we leverage information from disruptions for which
we have detailed device information (recall § 5). We select 201 ASes,
for which we have at least 50 disruptions with device information.
In Figure 12, for each AS, we show its pearson correlation (x-
axis), as well as the fraction of disruptions (with device information)
that showed interim device activity (y-axis). ASes close to the origin
show both a very low correlation of disruptions and anti-disruptions
and very few disruptions that had interim activity. For these ASes,
Figure 12: Per AS: Fraction of disruption with activity dur-
ing the disruption vs. pearson correlation of AS-wide disrup-
tions and anti-disruptions. Major US ISPs are highlighted
and discussed in § 8.
disruptions are, by our metrics, more likely to correspond to service
outages. The majority of ASes falls close to the origin: Some 54% of
the ASes have both correlation lower than 0.1 and less than 10% of
instances of during-disruption activity (70% have values lower than
0.2 / 0.2). However, we also find that some ASes show high anti-
disruption correlations and high shares of disruptions that are not
service outages (per our ID dataset). These ASes have the potential
to significantly bias measurement results and, in the case of large
ASes, even skew per-country assessments of Internet reliability.
ISP feedback: When we aggregated disruption events to coun-
tries (not reported here), a smaller European country showed the
worst reliability, by far, if one assumed that all disruptions were
service outages. However, the cause was a major ISP in that coun-
try making extensive use of temporary reassignment of address
space, resulting in major and frequent anti-disruptions. A contact
at that ISP confirmed that indeed this was the practice, and that
subscribers did not lose Internet access service during these events.
7.2 Feature-Based Discrimination
Having identified that anti-disruptions are particularly pronounced
for specific networks, we next seek to assess whether there are
dominant features of disruption events that allow us to distinguish
between different types of disruptions. We hence study properties
of disruption events for which we have per-device information (§ 5).
We group disruptions into: (i) disruptions that showed activity in
the same AS and are thus unlikely to represent service outages, and
(ii) disruptions that did not show activity. We further partition the
latter into disruptions where end-device’s IP addresses changed or
not (§ 5.2). We focus on the duration of disruptions and on their
visibility (or lack thereof) in the global routing table.
Disruption duration: Figure 13a shows the CCDF of the duration
of disruptions, where we distinguish between our three classes.
Disruptions for which we recorded interim device activity6 last, on
average, longer than disruptions for which there was no device ac-
tivity. This effect becomes particularly pronounced for disruptions
that last longer than ≈ 20 hours, where the fraction of disruptions
6Here, we restrict our set of disruptions to only consider those in which activity was
recorded in the first hour to avoid bias towards longer disruptions.

Table 1: US broadband ISPs typically show few indications
of anti-disruptions. The majority if their address space saw
either zero or a single disruption, the majority of disrupted
/24s were exclusively affected during maintenance hours.
9 peers saw the prefix before the disruption (we removed some
3% of disruptions in which this was not the case). We then tag a
disruption as all peers down, if at some point during the first hour of
the disruption all peers lost visibility to the prefix. We tag it as some
peers down, if the number of peers that did see the announcement
was lower than before the disruption, but not zero.
Figure 13b shows how our detected disruptions (in the different
classes of disruptions) correspond with BGP withdrawals. Note that
only about 25% of the disruptions that had no sign of activity during
the disrupted period (i.e., are more likely to be a real service outage)
coincided with a BGP withdrawal (either all-peers-down or some-
peers-down). Thus, about 75% of these disruptions were not evident
from BGP. Whether the address changed after the disruption only
has a minimal (but visible) effect. Moreover, the left two bars of
Figure 13b show that some 16% of the disruptions that had interim
device activity, indicating that the disruption was not a service
outage, still coincided with BGP withdrawals. Interestingly, a higher
proportion of these withdrawals were not visible to all BGP peers.
Thus, when leveraging BGP withdrawals as outage detection signal:
withdrawal and absence of a prefix from the global routing table is
not definitive of a service outage.
8 CASE STUDY: U.S. BROADBAND
We next illustrate our findings with a case study of major US ISPs.
We selected the 7 largest US broadband ISPs, covering the majority
of US broadband subscribers [17]. Table 1 shows our results. All of
the ISPs are well-represented in our dataset.
Disruptions vs. outages: For each of these ISPs, Table 1, top lines,
reports their anti-disruption behavior, as well as the percent of dis-
ruptions for which activity was observed during the disruption, § 5.
We also annotated these ISPs in Figure 12. We note that with the
exception of ISP A and ISP G, most major US ISPs do not show
strong indicators of disruptions as result of mass prefix migrations
(§ 6). ISP A shows a higher correlation of anti-disruptions and dis-
ruptions, while ISP G shows a higher percentage of disruptions in
which we detected activity in other address blocks (§ 5.3). While
disruptions cannot be taken “at face value” to be service outages,
these ISPs are not among those that can heavily skew results. (e.g.,
top-right region in Figure 12).
Total disruptions: For the active /24s during the one-year obser-
vation interval, we see a very heterogeneous picture for the percent
(a) Duration of disruption events. Disruptions that do not cause
end users to lose connectivity are more likely to last longer than
disruptions that result in an actual service outage.
(b) BGP visibility of disruptions and outages. Some 18% of disrup-
tions are reflected w/ BGP withdrawals. A BGP withdrawal does
not imply an outage: In about 16% of the disruptions that had
activity during the disruption, we still see a BGP withdrawal.

without activity becomes very small. This observation can prove
helpful for outage detection system (ours included) when determin-
ing the maximum possible duration of detection intervals. We note,
however, that also some 30% of disruptions with interim activity
last just one hour. Looking at the two cases of disruptions without
interim address activity, we note that there is little to no differ-
ence between instances where the device’s IP addresses changed
vs remained unchanged after the disruption.
Visibility in BGP: We next assess if our detected disruptions are
reflected in global routing table activity, i.e., whether they align
with BGP withdrawals. While earlier work has shown that BGP
withdrawals do not necessarily imply loss of connectivity due to
the existence of default routes [18], we assess to what extent edge
activity disruptions and outages are reflected with BGP withdrawals.
We selected 10 large and geographically diverse ASes that provide a
full BGP feed to RouteViews.7 We then process weekly Routeviews
dumps and the subsequent updates and tag each /24 and hour during
our time period with the following BGP state: Number of peers that
saw a route to the corresponding /24 address block, and number
of peers that did not see a route to the corresponding /24 address
block (using longest prefix matching). Note that both numbers can
be at max 10, and it is possible for a prefix to be both visible and
invisible in a certain hour.
Then, for each disruption that resulted in a complete loss of
activity, we get the BGP state before the disruption (2 hours before
the first disrupted hour) as well as during the disruption (first hour
of the disruption). We only consider disruptions for which at least

that saw a disruption event, ranging from some 8% up to some 45%.
We caution against interpreting this number in favor of individual
ISPs, since the number of disrupted /24s depends on a variety of
factors dependent on individual network management practices,
such as filling degree (subscribers per /24), as well as churn in ad-
dress block use [48]. We note that in all cases less than half of their
active address space saw a disruption.
Effect of Hurricane Irma: Zooming in on those /24s that ever
had a disruption, we find that Hurricane Irma [36] was the most
profound event for ISPs active in the Florida region. Some 22.5%
(ISP D) resp. 11.3% (ISP A) of all disrupted /24s were only disrupted
within this very week, out of a total time period of 54 weeks.
Scheduled maintenance: Strikingly, we find that for all but one
of the ISPs, the majority of ever disrupted /24s was exclusively dis-
rupted during the typical maintenance window, weekdays between
midnight and 6AM. For three of our ISPs, some 70% of all disrupted
/24s fall only within this time period.
9 DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
Our study reveals a set of observations that challenge common prac-
tice and knowledge, and yield implications and future directions
for outage detection and interpretation.
9.1 Implications for Outage Detection
We challenge a core assumption that disruptions—temporary loss
of connectivity of individual address blocks—are necessarily indica-
tive of service outages. We found evidence of bulk reassignment
of IP addresses, sometimes resulting in large-scale anti-disruptions
events; these have the potential to confuse outage detection mecha-
nisms, including ours, as well as prior work [22, 46, 54]. Leveraging
