I am not very experienced with Python, so I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide to resolve this issue.

It appears that newer versions of Python 3 on Windows are encountering an SSL handshake problem. This issue seems to be specific to the `urllib3` package on Windows. I was able to successfully use Python 3.3.2 and 3.2.4 on Ubuntu without encountering this problem.

**Affected Versions:**
- Windows Python 3.3.x, 3.2.x

**Working Versions:**
- Non-Windows Python 3.3.x, 3.2.x
- Windows Python 3.1.x

While I believe the bug is in Python's `urllib3` rather than `requests`, I am not very experienced, so I feel a bit out of my depth. This bug affects anyone using `requests` as well. It seems related to this bug: [http://bugs.python.org/issue16361](http://bugs.python.org/issue16361).

To communicate with the server, I am using Lantern:
```python
v = lantern.AbstractAPI(username, password)
v.get_app_list()
```
This causes the failure. Even a simple GET request using `requests` directly results in the same issue:
```python
r = requests.get(url="https://analysiscenter.veracode.com/api/4.0/getapplist.do", auth=(username, password))
```

Here is the traceback for the error:

Please help me get this fixed, wherever it might need addressing. Thank you!
