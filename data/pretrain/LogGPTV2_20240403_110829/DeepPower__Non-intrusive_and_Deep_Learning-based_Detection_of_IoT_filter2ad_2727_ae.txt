detection method is still a dominant research direction, there are
other solutions that focus on low-overhead host-based detection.
6.1 Network-based Solution
Network-based solutions have been commonly used for protecting
IoT systems [17, 25, 42, 44]. Gu et al. [19] presented BotHunter, a
dialog correlation method that utilizes malware-specific signatures
to recognize the malware infection for botnet detection in tradi-
tional networks. However, IoT network traffic is device-specific and
depends on different environmental settings. Due to the diversity of
IoT devices and manufacturers, it is impractical or non-scalable to
create malware signatures [61]. It is also challenging to define nor-
mal baselines of IoT networks for anomaly detection. In addition,
IoT Botnets have continued to evolve and adapt to the advanced
techniques. For example, a newer version of Mirai, DvrHelper, is
the first malware designed to bypass an anti-DDoS solution by
using challenge-response policies and shared Google reCAPTCHA
response token [54]. Although new network-based detection meth-
ods for IoT malware are constantly being proposed [42, 44], they
still cannot identify more detailed activities that occur in IoT devices.
Our detection approach is able to discovery detailed information
about infection activities of IoT malware, which could be a promis-
ing complement to existing network-based solutions.

To secure IoT devices, one preferred solution is to update and patch
buggy firmware for these vulnerable devices. However, due to lack
of suitable facilities, it is difficult to keep track of the available
patches and apply them to all unpatched devices. Also, not all de-
vices are compatible with the available updates due to their outdated
hardware. Considering the constraints of limited resources, only a
few studies have focused on host-based IoT security solution. Sun et
al. [51] proposed a cloud-based detection with reversible sketch
for resource-constrained IoT devices to improve the security of the
devices. Abbas et al. [2] presented a simple signature-based method
that leverages a subset of signatures to detect a group of malware
for IoT devices. Su et al. [50] proposed a light-weight detection
method for IoT malware, based on a local and cloud-based malware
detector. However, all those solutions require the installation of
software in IoT devices, but not all devices can afford such runtime
overhead.
6.3 Side-channel Analysis
The side-channel analysis has been recently developed to distin-
guish malicious and legitimate behaviors based on the power con-
sumption of Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA)
devices [9], Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) [60], and Mi-
croController Unit (MCU) [33]. Especially, WattsUpDoc [9] utilizes
an anomaly-based analysis to detect malware on medical devices.
However, most of the existing side-channel analysis approaches
focus on differentiating normal and abnormal patterns. They don’t
consider the internal details of anomalous cases and cannot identify
the anomalous cases as specific malicious activities (i.e., commands).
To achieve the goal of non-intrusive detection, DeepPower can ef-
fectively infer specific infection activities and conduct a correlation
analysis among activities to output final detection results. Apart
from the power signals, Electromagnetic (EM) signals [21, 43] and
radio-frequency (RF) emissions [49] have also been used for the
anomaly detection of program execution. Our work selects the
power side-channel signal because of its favorable properties: easy
to collect, less susceptible to environmental influence, and closely
correlated with the system’s workload.
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have conducted a systematic study of the IoT
malware infection process. Based on an in-depth understanding
of IoT malware infection patterns, we have introduced DeepPower,
a non-intrusive and deep learning-based detection solution based
on power side-channel analysis to discover IoT malware infection.
We have first verified whether the processed signals of different
individual activities are distinguishable. Based on our experiments,
the mel-scaled spectrogram features are used to distinguish fine-
grained power characteristics of activities accurately. Then, we
have trained a Seq2Seq model to infer activities from the power
signals. To examine its feasibility, we have conducted experimental
verification on the real-world malware infection process, and our
experimental results show that most of the infection processes can
be accurately detected. For our future work, we will further improve
the detection accuracy of IoT malware by choosing more effective
detection models. Besides, due to the lack of effective score calcu-
lation method for state S0, our current work doesn’t consider the
influence of this state on the detection results. An interesting future
work is to estimate the score of S0, and also combine DeepPower
with network traffic analysis for a more comprehensive detection
of IoT malware.
