### Detection Methods and Solutions for IoT Malware

Detection methods remain a dominant research focus, but there are also emerging solutions that emphasize low-overhead, host-based detection. This section will explore three primary approaches: network-based, host-based, and side-channel analysis.

#### 6.1 Network-Based Solutions

Network-based solutions have been widely used to protect IoT systems [17, 25, 42, 44]. For instance, Gu et al. [19] introduced BotHunter, a dialog correlation method that uses malware-specific signatures to detect botnet infections in traditional networks. However, IoT network traffic is highly device-specific and varies with different environmental settings. The diversity of IoT devices and manufacturers makes it impractical or non-scalable to create comprehensive malware signatures [61]. Additionally, defining normal baselines for anomaly detection in IoT networks is challenging. IoT botnets continue to evolve, adapting to advanced techniques. For example, DvrHelper, a newer version of Mirai, was designed to bypass anti-DDoS solutions by using challenge-response policies and shared Google reCAPTCHA response tokens [54].

Despite the ongoing development of new network-based detection methods for IoT malware [42, 44], these methods often struggle to identify detailed activities within IoT devices. Our detection approach, however, can uncover detailed information about the infection activities of IoT malware, complementing existing network-based solutions.

#### 6.2 Host-Based Solutions

To secure IoT devices, one preferred solution is to update and patch vulnerable firmware. However, this is often difficult due to the lack of suitable facilities and the challenge of tracking and applying available patches to all unpatched devices. Moreover, not all devices are compatible with updates due to outdated hardware. Given these constraints, only a few studies have focused on host-based IoT security solutions.

Sun et al. [51] proposed a cloud-based detection system with reversible sketches for resource-constrained IoT devices, enhancing their security. Abbas et al. [2] presented a simple signature-based method that leverages a subset of signatures to detect a group of malware for IoT devices. Su et al. [50] developed a lightweight detection method for IoT malware, combining local and cloud-based malware detectors. However, these solutions require the installation of software on IoT devices, which not all devices can support due to runtime overhead.

#### 6.3 Side-Channel Analysis

Side-channel analysis has recently emerged as a method to distinguish between malicious and legitimate behaviors based on power consumption. This approach has been applied to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) devices [9], Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) [60], and Microcontroller Units (MCU) [33]. For example, WattsUpDoc [9] uses anomaly-based analysis to detect malware on medical devices.

However, most existing side-channel analysis methods focus on differentiating normal and abnormal patterns without considering the internal details of anomalous cases. They cannot identify specific malicious activities, such as commands. To address this, DeepPower can effectively infer specific infection activities and conduct correlation analysis among activities to produce final detection results. In addition to power signals, electromagnetic (EM) signals [21, 43] and radio-frequency (RF) emissions [49] have also been used for anomaly detection in program execution. We chose power side-channel signals for their ease of collection, resistance to environmental influences, and close correlation with the system's workload.

### 7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we conducted a systematic study of the IoT malware infection process. Based on an in-depth understanding of IoT malware infection patterns, we introduced DeepPower, a non-intrusive, deep learning-based detection solution that uses power side-channel analysis to discover IoT malware infections. We first verified whether the processed signals of different individual activities are distinguishable. Our experiments showed that mel-scaled spectrogram features can accurately distinguish fine-grained power characteristics of activities. We then trained a Seq2Seq model to infer activities from power signals. Experimental verification on real-world malware infection processes demonstrated that most infection processes can be accurately detected.

For future work, we aim to improve the detection accuracy of IoT malware by exploring more effective detection models. Additionally, our current work does not consider the influence of state S0 due to the lack of an effective score calculation method. Future research will estimate the score of S0 and integrate DeepPower with network traffic analysis for a more comprehensive detection of IoT malware.
