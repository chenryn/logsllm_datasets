Abstract. In recent years, Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer network based crypto
digital currency, has attracted a lot of attentions from the media, the
academia, and the general public. A user in Bitcoin network can create
Bitcoins by packing and verifying new transactions in the network using
their computation power. Driven by the price surge of Bitcoin, users
are increasingly investing on expensive specialized hardware for Bitcoin
mining. To obtain steady payouts, users also pool their computation
resources to conduct pool mining. In this paper, we study the evolution
of Bitcoin miners by analyzing the complete transaction blockchain. We
characterize how the productivity, computation power and transaction
activity of miners evolve over time. We also conduct an in-depth study on
the largest mining pool F2Pool. We show how it grows over time and how
computation power is distributed among its miners. Finally, we build a
simple economic model to explain the evolution of Bitcoin miners.

1 Introduction
Bitcoin [1] is known as the ﬁrst decentralized digital currency in the world [2].
Unlike any traditional currency issued and regulated by a sovereign bank, Bit-
coin is not controlled by any institution or country. It circulates globally without
boundary and is free from ﬁnancial regulation systems due to its decentralized
P2P accounting and transaction design. Debuted in 2009 and after ﬁve years’
development, Bitcoin exchange price has risen from nothing to over $100 per
coin through mid 2013, surged to its peak at $1, 242 on Nov. 29, and is wob-
bling between $350 and $600 in today’s market. Till September 2014, the market
capitalization of Bitcoin has increased to around 6 billion US dollars; and the Bit-
coin network runs over 60, 000 transactions daily. Along with Bitcoin network’s
capitalization and volume, a variety number of derivative services have been
developed and legalized. Exchange markets, i.e., Coinbase [3] and Bitstamp [4],
allow users to buy and sell Bitcoins using regular currencies globally. Online
merchants, e.g., Dell and Overstock, are now accepting Bitcoin as a payment
method. Governments of several countries, such as Canada and Thailand, have

approved fully-legal Bitcoin exchange and issued tax guidance on Bitcoin trans-
actions. Diﬀerent from a regular currency, there is no central bank or authority
who decides how many Bitcoins to be issued and distributed. According to the
Bitcoin protocol, there are only a ﬁnite amount of Bitcoins. In addition to buying
Bitcoins from others, the only way for a user to acquire Bitcoins is to contribute
her computation resources to pack and verify new transactions. We call this
process Bitcoin mining and users who participate in mining as Bitcoin miners.
The Bitcoin protocol is designed so that new Bitcoins are mined at a steady
rate until all Bitcoins are mined. The surge of Bitcoin price motivates Bitcoin
miners to invest on more and more powerful hardware for faster mining. Due to
the dramatic growth in both the number of Bitcoin miners and the computation
power of their hardware, it has become increasingly diﬃcult to mine Bitcoins.
For an individual miner, even with powerful hardware, it now takes a very long
time for her to get Bitcoins if she does mining by herself, the so-called solo min-
ing. Similar to pooling money to buy lottery, majority of the miners choose to
pool their computation resources to mine Bitcoins together, the so-called pool
mining. Pool mining gives individual miners steadier payouts than solo mining.
Bitcoin network is a P2P system that peers can obtain direct ﬁnancial incen-
tives by contributing their computation resources. While the Bitcoin price is con-
stantly driven by various economic, politic and legal factors, we are interested
in ﬁnding out how Bitcoin price evolution drives the miners’ mining behav-
iors. Towards this goal, we conduct a measurement study on the evolution of
Bitcoin miners by analyzing the complete transaction blockchain of the Bitcoin
network from its very ﬁrst transaction in 2009 to March 2014. We ﬁrst character-
ize how the productivity, computation power and transaction activity of miners
evolve over time. We then conduct an in-depth study on the largest mining pool
F2Pool [5]. We characterize how it grows and how the computation power is dis-
tributed among its heterogeneous members. Finally, we build a simple economic
model which explains the evolution of miners by considering the Bitcoin price
and the computation race between miners.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review the related work in
Sect. 2. A short survey of Bitcoin network and the mining process is presented in
Sect. 3. We present our methodology of analysis and the characterization results
in Sects. 4 and 5, respectively. The paper is concluded in Sect. 6.

3 Survey of Bitcoin Network
3.1 Account and Transaction
Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer network without central authority. A Bitcoin
account is simply a pair of public/private keys. An account ID is derived from
its public key. The private key is used to generate digital signature for authen-
tication. There is no cost to create a Bitcoin account. So each Bitcoin user can
create as many accounts as she wishes. Transaction is the mechanism for users
to transfer Bitcoins to each other. A transaction consists of a set of senders
and a set of receivers (denoted by their account IDs), the amount from each
sender, and the amount to each receiver. For example, if Alice wants to send
3 Bitcoins (BTCs) to Bob. She might send from two of her accounts: one account
A1 has 1 BTC and the other account A2 has 2 BTCs. Suppose Bob has only one
account B1, thus this transaction is simply: 1 BTC from A1, 2 BTCs from A2,
and 3 BTCs to B1. Finally, all senders will sign the transaction with their pri-
vate keys, and the signed transaction is broadcast to the entire Bitcoin network.
Any user who receives this transaction will ﬁrst verify whether the senders have
the amount of BTCs indicated in the transaction. Diﬀerent from the traditional
banking systems, there is no central database to maintain the Bitcoin balance
of each account. Instead, the whole Bitcoin network stores and veriﬁes all the
transactions using a shared blockchain. Any user can check the balance of any
account by backtracking the blockchain to retrieve all transactions associated
the account. Invalid transactions will be discarded, and valid ones will be stored
in memory to be packed and appended to the blockchain.
3.2 Block and Blockchain
The blockchain is a public ledger shared in the whole Bitcoin network. As the
name suggests, the blockchain contains a chain of chronologically ordered blocks,
each of which contains transactions within a time window of ten minutes and
a generation transaction indicating which account packed this block. Each user
downloads and synchronizes a copy of the blockchain in her local machine to
verify incoming transactions. All newly conﬁrmed transactions are packed into
a new block, which will be broadcast to the whole network. Whenever a user
receives a block, she will validate all the transactions in this block using the
current blockchain. If any transaction is invalid, she will discard the block. Oth-
erwise, this block will be conﬁrmed and appended to the current blockchain.

3.3 Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin network depends on the computation resources on users to maintain
the integrity of the blockchain. Each user can volunteer to verify and pack new
transactions to blocks. While a lot of users are doing the veriﬁcation and packing
work simultaneously, only the newest valid block will be conﬁrmed by all users
and appended to the current blockchain. The user (miner) who created this
block will get rewarded with some BTCs (the current reward is 25 BTCs/block).
To achieve this, a proof-of-work mechanism is introduced. When packing new
transactions to a block, a miner ﬁrst generates a special transaction indicating
that the network sends her the mining reward. Along with all other transactions,
she repeatedly generates a random number nonce, put them together and runs
a hash function. If the hash value is below a target value, the user claims she
created the block and broadcasts the block and the nonce. Other users can easily
perform the same hash function with the published nonce to verify the block.
According to Nakamoto’s protocol [1], the total number of BTCs that can be
mined is 21 million and the last BTC to be mined is in block #6, 929, 999 near
year 2140. By default, a new block is created approximately every ten minutes,
no matter how much aggregate computation power is in the network. To control
the new block creation speed, a diﬃculty value is introduced. The target value
for block hash calculation is inversely proportional to the diﬃculty value. As a
result, the higher the diﬃculty value, the more hash calculations each miner has
to conduct to ﬁnd a hash value below the target. As detailed in [15], at a given
diﬃculty value D, for a miner with computation power of H hashes per second,
the expected time for the miner to generate a new valid block is:
E[T ] =
D × 232
H s.
(1)
The diﬃculty value is updated every 2, 016 blocks based on the speed at which
the past 2, 016 blocks were generated. The diﬃculty value is stored in each block.
Knowing how many BTCs are generated in the whole network in one day, given
the diﬃculty value, we can also calculate the total hash rate of the system.
Solo and Pool Mining. In the early days of Bitcoin, miners mined blocks
individually. We call this approach solo mining. The advantage of solo mining is
whenever a block is created by the miner, she gets all the rewards. However, as
more and more computation resources are injected to the Bitcoin network, the
diﬃculty value has to be increased signiﬁcantly to control the new block creation
speed. Now it takes a powerful miner years to create a block. Pool mining is a
way for miners to pool their resources together to obtain steady payouts. A pool
assigns a lower diﬃculty value to each of its members. It becomes easier for each
miner in the pool to solve the hash problem and prove their work. Each pool
miner submits her own hash values under the pool target value (called shares)
to the pool for veriﬁcation. If a share is under the network target value, a block
is claimed by the pool and pool operator will distribute the reward to every
294

pool miners. The most popular payout approach for pool mining is pay-per-
share, in which miners are rewarded proportionally to the number of shares they
submitted to the pool. With pool mining, the expected payout for a minor is the
same as solo mining, but the variance of payout is largely reduced.
4 Methodology
4.1 Data Collection
As described in Sect. 3, all transactions in Bitcoin network are stored in the
blockchain. When a user wants to make a transfer, she must ﬁrst connect to
the Bitcoin network and synchronize with the current blockchain. We ran the
Bitcoin client in our local machine to get the latest blockchain. After collecting
the blockchain, we parsed it to blocks and transactions. Each block has its hash
value, height (block ID), hash value of the previous block, generation time (in
UTC timestamp), the amount of new BTCs created, target diﬃculty, nonce, and
all transactions in the block. For each transaction, inputs include the previous
transaction hashes of the senders and the associated signature scripts; outputs
include the receiver account IDs and their corresponding amounts. We use the
previous transaction hash to retrieve the transaction history and the balance
of each sender by iteratively backtracking the blockchain. We synchronized the
complete blockchain in March 2014 and parsed the data. The raw data includes
all blocks and transactions from 2009/01/03 (the very ﬁrst Bitcoin block cre-
ated) to 2014/03/11. We retrieved 290,089 blocks and 34,646,076 transactions.
We then parsed all blocks and transactions ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld and stored all the parsed
information into a MYSQL database.
4.2 Solo Miner Analysis
Pool mining only started on 16th December 2010 [16]. All previous miners were
solo miners. After the introduction of pool mining, each pool also uses one unique
ID to mine Bitcoins. We ﬁrst treat each unique Bitcoin ID who successfully
created a block as a solo miner. As a result, we treat pools as solo miners for
now. Using block timestamps, we count the number of BTCs mined by miners
each month in the network. Also, using Bitcoin exchange market data [3] we
calculate the monthly USD (we assume BTCs were exchanged to USD at market
price immediately after they were mined) generated in the network. Moreover,
we also obtain the distribution of how many BTCs each miner mined over time.
Besides the earnings, we can also estimate the aggregate computation power
of all miners. With a given diﬃculty value of D, if N blocks were mined in a
day, based on (1), the aggregate daily hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network
can be estimated as:
Htotal =
(2)
N × D × 232
86, 400
Similarly, we can estimate a miner’s daily hash rate by replacing N with the
number of blocks the miner mined in a day.

We are also interested in whether the miners cashed out their mined BTCs
after mining. However, it is hard to collect IDs of all Bitcoin exchange markets
so as to track all transactions between the miners and the exchange markets.
Instead, we track for each miner the interval between the time when she mined
some new BTCs and the time when her next transaction was issued. This time
interval serves as a lower bound for her cash out lag.
4.3 Pool Miner Analysis
To study how Bitcoin mining pool evolves, we collect pool data from our data-
base. We choose miner IDs with top hash rates in the network and manually
classify them. Most of these IDs belong to well-known mining pools according
to Blockchain.info, an online Bitcoin statistics website. To analyze pool mining
behaviors, we choose F2Pool, a China-based mining pool whose payout rule is
clear and the payout transactions are easy to obtain. In our data up to March
2014, F2Pool ranked 7th in terms of the total computation power in the network.
According to the newest statistics in [17], in September 2014, F2Pool grows to
the largest mining pool, having over 25 % of the overall computation power.
We query transactions having F2Pool’s account ID and classify them as input
or output. For transactions having F2Pool ID as the only receiver, we identify
whether they are block generation transactions. For a transaction having it as
the only sender, we validate whether the transaction is used to distribute payouts
to pool miners. Pools have diﬀerent approaches to send payouts to pool miners.
The simplest way is that the pool sends out payouts to all pool miners in one
transaction immediately after each block is created. However, none of the ten
pools we checked use this approach. Some pools use a binary tree like iterative
payout approach which pays one pool miner and transfer the remaining balance
to a new ID at each iteration. And some pools randomly choose a number of
miners to pay in one transaction and transfer the remaining balance to a new
ID, and then distribute the remaining balance in subsequent transactions. When
F2Pool mines a block, it will send out the payouts in the next day. It used to
send out payouts to all members using a single transaction, but changed to two
transactions recently. Knowing the payout mechanism, we can calcualte how
many BTCs each pool miner earns each day using pool payout transactions.
4.4 Simple Economic Model for Miners
To become a miner, a user ﬁrst needs to invest on hardware, ranging from regular
computers in early days, to graphics card, GPUs, and specially designed ASIC
chips, and incur the capital cost. After she joins the network for mining, she needs
to pay the bill for electricity, air conditioning, housing and maintenance etc., and
incur the operational cost. Since miners are driven by proﬁts derived from the
mined Bitcoins, the economic question is whether and how soon their revenues
can cover their capital and operational costs? We build a simple economic model.
For a hardware with hash rate H, based on (1), assume the hardware works 24 h
296
L. Wang and Y. Liu
per day, the expected number of BTCs it can mine daily is:
N(t, H) =
H × 86, 400
D(t) × 232
R,
(3)
where D(t) is the diﬃculty value in day t, R is the number of BTCs rewarded
for each block. If the hardware’s power consumption is P kw, and the electricity
price is η(t) per kwh, the daily electricity bill is 24P η. Given the Bitcoin exchange
price of ρ(t) in day t, if we only consider electricity operational cost, the daily
proﬁt rate r(t) for the hardware with hash rate H and power consumption P is:
r(t, H, P ) = N(t, H)ρ(t) − 24P η(t).
(4)
Obviously, a miner prefers places with low electricity price η(t), and will shut
down her hardware whenever the proﬁt rate becomes negative. Based on (3) and
(4), to maintain a positive proﬁt rate, the hardware’s computation-over-power
eﬃciency should satisfy:
H
P
> K
η(t)D(t)
Rρ(t)
,
(5)
(cid:2) t0+τ
where K is a constant. As D(t) increases, hardware with low computation-over-
power eﬃciency will be quickly kicked out of the mining game.
To obtain high proﬁt rate, minors should go for specialized mining hard-
ware with high computation-over-power eﬃciency. Those hardware come at high
prices, though. If the miner purchased a piece of expensive hardware at day t0
with price C, the time τ it takes her to recover the capital cost should satisfy:
r(t, H, P ) × I[r(t, H, P )]dt = C,
(6)
t0
where I[x] is the indicator function which equals to 1 if x > 0, and 0 otherwise.
4.5 Limit of Computation Race
According to (4), miners are highly incentivized to increase their computation
power to obtain higher proﬁt margin. The Bitcoin network has witnessed expo-
nential computation power growth in the past few years. But at the same time,
the number of Bitcoins that can be mined each day is deliberately set to a ﬁx
value. If the Bitcoin price is kept ﬂat, the total mining proﬁt that miners can
obtain from the network is a constant. All miners are essentially playing a zero-
sum computation race game: each miner increases her computation power, then
the total computation power in the network increases; consequently the system
increases the diﬃculty value D(t) to maintain a steady Bitcoin creation speed,
which in turn reduces the Bitcoin mining rate of individual miners, according
to (3). This is a unfortunate and unavoidable tragedy-of-common phenomena
that has been observed in the Bitcoin network. Such a race will automatically
end when the proﬁt margin hits zero. We can predict the equilibrium point by
