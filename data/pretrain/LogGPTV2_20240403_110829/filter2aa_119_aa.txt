}  Information is 
represented on the 
graph as Entities 
}  For example, an 
Entity could be: 
◦  Email Address 
◦  Image 
◦  Phone Number 
◦  Etc. 
}  Each Entity has a 
value and optionally 
some fields.

}  Two types of transforms: 
◦  Remote: runs on a remote Paterva or third-party 
Transform Server. 
◦  Local: runs on the user’s local machine.

Pros 
Cons 
ü  Paterva’s Transforms 
ü Awesome!!! 
ü  Centralized Transform 
Management & 
Maintenance 
ü Implementation details 
hidden from the user 
(protects your IP) 
ü  Minimal Client-Side 
Processing Overhead 
✗  Limited Data Visibility 
✗  i.e. Server can only query 
accessible data. 
✗  Breach of Privacy 
✗  OSInt target/subject 
disclosed to a third-party. 
✗  Limited Client-Side 
Control: 
✗  Transforms might not be 
evil enough J 
Nadeem Douba | www.cygnos.com

Pros 
Cons 
ü  Full Client-side Control 
ü No limits as to how 1337 
or evil your transforms can 
be J 
ü  Privacy 
ü OSInt subject may not be 
disclosed to third-party 
ü  Great Data Visibility 
ü “The world is one’s oyster” 
ü  Extensible 
ü Maltego can be used for 
other types of data 
visualization J 
✗  Processing Overhead 
✗  Client’s machine 
responsible for running 
transforms 
✗  Development 
✗  It’s in your hands (or 
somebody else’s… just 
delegate ;) 
✗  IP Disclosure 
✗  Implementation details no 
longer hidden from users. 
✗  Difficult to Maintain
