# DDoS Mitigation and Bypass Testing

## 12. TCP Timing Controls
TCP timing controls can be used to manage the rate of connections and reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. These controls, focusing on connection management, serve to lessen the strain on network resources. However, they can be circumvented through various techniques, as shown in Figure 12.

## HTTP Attack Vectors
### "Kill 'em All" Approach
The "Kill 'em All" approach offers a versatile attack vector with short requests that are difficult to distinguish from normal traffic. To avoid being fingerprinted, this method uses randomized User-Agent strings and custom headers. For example, CVE-2011-3192 can be exploited by setting a custom header like "Range: bytes=<long list of numbers>".

## Performance Testing
Performance tests were conducted against several DDoS mitigation products and services, including:
1. Arbor Peakflow SP Threat Management System (TMS)
2. NSFocus Anti-DDoS System (ADS)
3. Cloudflare
4. Akamai

We are convinced that these solutions, particularly those from Arbor and NSFocus, are widely deployed in the market. 

### Testing Methodology
Tests were conducted against both products and cloud services. A workstation was connected to a web site and subjected to simulated attacks. To simulate normal browsing conditions, a single TCP connection was used to carry multiple HTTP requests and responses. This setup ensured that no single attack identification mechanism could block the entire connection.

During testing, attack traffic was sent to the backend, and the received traffic was compared to the original generated traffic. A bypass was considered successful if all attack traffic passed through intact.

### Testing Results
Table 1 summarizes the results of the bypass testing for each detection technique:

| Detection Techniques | Arbor Peakflow SP TMS | NSFocus ADS | Cloudflare | Akamai |
|----------------------|------------------------|--------------|------------|--------|
| Rate Measurement / Baseline Enforcement | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Protocol Sanity & Behavior Checking | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Proactive Housekeeping (TCP Connection Reset) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Big Data Analysis (GeoIP Policing) | — (Not implemented in ADS) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Malicious Source Intelligence | — (Not implemented in ADS) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Protocol Pattern Matching | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Source Host Verification | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| TCP SYN Authentication | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| HTTP Redirect Authentication | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| HTTP Cookie Authentication | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| JavaScript Authentication | — (Not implemented in TMS) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| CAPTCHA Authentication | — (Not implemented in TMS) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Key Observations
- **Arbor Peakflow SP TMS**: We successfully bypassed all documented and active detection techniques relevant to HTTP DDoS attacks.
- **NSFocus ADS**: Despite robust defenses, we achieved a 50% success rate in solving the CAPTCHA using OCR algorithms. This is significant given the shotgun approach to attacks.
- **Cloudflare**: We defeated all JavaScript, Cookie, and Redirect Authentications, pushing attack traffic to the backend.
- **Akamai**: Although source host verification techniques are implemented, we were unable to trigger them, possibly because our traffic mimicked real browser traffic.

## Discussions and Next Generation Mitigation
In the current landscape of blended attacks, traditional detection methods are becoming less effective. The primary reason for their continued use is often due to implementation immaturity, such as the lack of a ready-to-use JavaScript engine with a functional DOM.

### CAPTCHA
CAPTCHA remains a strong defense, but it significantly diminishes the usability and accessibility of protected websites. Automated queries and Web 2.0 mashing become impossible, limiting its application scope. Therefore, CAPTCHA is often not enabled by default in security service offerings.

### Next Generation Mitigation
Given the amplification property of modern DDoS attacks, we propose a control mechanism based on asymmetric client puzzles. This approach makes DDoS attacks more expensive and less cost-effective for attackers. Prior research, such as the Princeton-RSA paper, supports this approach.
