A RECRUITMENT MATERIAL
We are researchers from FIU, a university in the US, looking for
freelancers with provable App Search Optimization (ASO) exper-
tise in Google Play, willing to participate in a survey. We will ask
you questions about your experience working as an app search
optimization (ASO) freelancer. We are conducting this survey part
of an e(cid:29)ort to increase our understanding of how the ASO process
optimizes mobile apps.
Your participation in this study is con(cid:27)dential. We will never
reveal to anyone any information that may be linked to you, in-
cluding the fact that you participated in our study.
Your participation is completely voluntary and you may choose to
withdraw at any time or not answer questions that you do not feel
comfortable answering. If you agree to participate, please send
me an e-mail at mrahm031@(cid:27)u.edu.
Figure 17: Recruitment message sent to each identi(cid:27)ed ASO
worker.
Figure 17 shows the recruitment message that we sent to each
ASO worker that we identi(cid:27)ed. Figure 18 shows the script that we
read to each ASO worker who replied to the recruitment message
and quali(cid:27)ed for our study.
Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study. My name is
Mizanur Rahman, and I am a student at FIU.
In this study, I would like to ask you questions about your
experience working as an app search optimization, or ASO,
freelancer. The questions will explore your perspectives on ASO
strategies in Google Play. The study should take up to 1 hour.
If you decide to participate, you will be one of up to 100 people in
this study. We will pay you $5 for every 15 minutes of your time,
that is, $20 if we talk for 1 hour.
The bene(cid:27)ts of your participation include receiving feed-
back on vulnerabilities that your strategies may have, and
also helping us better understand and model the app search
optimization process in Google Play.
Please note that some of the questions that we will ask you,
may be upsetting. You can skip any questions you don’t want to
answer, or stop the study entirely, at any time. Your participation
in this study is voluntary. You are free to participate in the study
or withdraw your consent at any time during the study. Your
withdrawal or lack of participation will not a(cid:29)ect any bene(cid:27)ts to
which you are otherwise entitled.
In addition, once we publish our results, other parties, including
Google, may use them to try to develop techniques to detect your
activities. We note that you already run this risk, even if you do
not participate in our study. This is because other developers
who hire you, may work for Google, and could use data that they
collect from you, to directly impact your activities, e.g., block
your accounts or remove the reviews that you write. However,
we will never do this.
Please be assured that your participation in this study is
con(cid:27)dential. We will keep the records of this study private and
protected to the fullest extent provided by law. In any sort of
report we might publish, we will not include any information
that will make it possible to identify you. We will store records
securely, and only the researcher team will have access to the
records. However, your records may be reviewed for audit
purposes by authorized University or other agents who will be
bound by the same provisions of con(cid:27)dentiality.
Now, please read the consent form at the following link,
https://(cid:27)u.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8wYphZYyVQ4lTz7, and
tell me if you want to participate in the study. If you want to
participate, please click on the button at the end of the form, that
says "I consent". Before we begin, do you have any questions?
