Tourism Information System Integration
Tourism information systems provide travel agencies and customers with crucial
information such as flight details, accommodations, prices, and the availability of
services. Dedicated and specialized information systems are providing real time
tourism data to travel agents, customers, and other organizations.
A few years ago, e-tourism applications were mainly focused on handling transac-
tions and managing catalogs. Applications automated only a small portion of the

electronic transaction process, for example, taking orders, scheduling shipments,
and providing customer service. E-tourism was held back by closed markets that
could not use each other’s services due to the use of incompatible protocols.
Business requirements of dynamic applications, however, are evolving beyond
transaction support and include requirements for the interoperability and integration
of heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed tourism information systems. The
objective is to provide a global and homogeneous logical view of travel products
that are physically distributed over tourism data sources. However, in general, tour-
ism information systems are not designed for integration. A considerable number
of tourism information systems were developed in the 1960s when the integration
of information systems was not a major concern.
One of the challenges that dynamic packaging applications face is the integration
of the five tourism information systems most widespread in the tourism industry
that are a fundamental infrastructure for providing access to tourism information,
namely, computerized reservation systems (CRS), global distribution systems (GDS),
hotel distribution systems (HDS), destination management systems (DMS), and
Web sites (Figure 2).
Computerized Reservation System
A CRS is a travel supplier’s own central reservation system (Inkpen, 1998). A CRS
enables travel agencies to find what a customer is looking for and makes customer
data storage and retrieval relatively simple. These systems contain information about
airline schedules, availability, fares, and related services. Some systems provide
services to make reservations and issue tickets. CRS were introduced in the 1950s
as internal systems within individual organizations. With time and with the develop-
ment of communication technologies they became available to travel agencies and
other organizations. CRS are extremely popular and widespread, especially among
airlines. It is estimated that 70% of all bookings are made through this channel
(European Travel Agents’ and Tour Operators’ Associations, 2004).

Global Distribution System
A GDS is a super switch connecting several CRSs. A GDS integrates tourism infor-
mation about airlines, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and other travel products. It is used
almost exclusively by travel agents. The airline industry created the GDS concept
in the 1960s. As with CRSs, the goal was to keep track of airline schedules, avail-
ability, fares, and related services. Prior to the introduction of GDSs, travel agents
spent a considerable amount of time manually entering reservations. Since GDSs
allowed automating the reservation process for travel agents, they were able to be
productive and turn into an extension of the airline’s sales force (HotelOnline, 2002).
The use of these systems is expensive since they charge a fee for every segment
of travel sold through the system. There are currently four major GDSs (Inkpen,
1998): Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre, and Worldspan. Today, 90% of all U.S. tickets are
sold through these four global distribution systems (Riebeek, 2003).
Hotel Distribution System
An HDS works closely with GDSs to provide the hotel industry with automated
sales and booking services. An HDS is tied into a GDS, allowing hotel bookings
to be made in the same way as an airline reservation (Inkpen, 1998). HDSs may be
categorized into two main types: (1) the HDS is linked directly to the hotel’s own
booking system and in turn linked with a GDS that can be accessed by booking
agents, and (2) dedicated companies provide a reservation system linked to airline
GDSs.
Destination Management Systems
DMSs supply interactively accessible information about a destination, enabling tour-
ist destinations to disseminate information about products and services as well as to
facilitate the planning, management, and marketing of regions as tourism entities or
brands (Buhalis, 2002). These systems offer a guide to tourist attractions, festivals,
and cultural events, coupled with online bookings for accommodation providers.
They also feature weather reports, Web movies, and feed from Web cams positioned
in popular tourist areas. One of the goals of DMS is to develop flexible, tailor-made,
specialized, and integrated tourism products. Two of the most well known DMSs
include Tiscover1 (Austria) and Gulliver2 (Ireland).

Direct Distribution using Web Sites
The Internet is revolutionizing the distribution of tourism information and sales.
Small and large companies can have Web sites with “equal Internet access” to in-
ternational tourism markets. Previously, many companies had to use their booking
systems as platforms from which to distribute their products via existing channels,
such as GDSs. Recently, companies such as the airlines, have chosen the strategy
to sell tickets on their own Web sites to avoid using a GDS (Dombey, 1998). This
is the simplest and cheapest strategy to sell tickets since they do not have to pay a
fee to the GDS. Small providers, such as local hotels, can use the Internet to supply
information about their products and allow the automatic booking of rooms and
other services. A recent survey (O’Connor, 2003) revealed that over 95% of hotel
chains had a Web site, with almost 90% of these providing technology to allow
customers to book directly.
Tourism Data Source Integration
Given the rapid growth and success of tourism data sources, it becomes increas-
ingly attractive to extract data from these sources and make it available for dynamic
packaging applications. Manually integrating multiple heterogeneous data sources
into applications is a time-consuming, costly, and error-prone engineering task. Ac-
cording to industry estimates, as much as 70% of information technology spending
may be allocated for integration-related activities. Consequently, many organizations
are looking for solutions that can make the integration of information systems an
easier task (Gorton, Almquist, Dorow, Gong, & Thurman, 2005).
Data source integration is a research topic of enormous practical importance for
dynamic packaging. Integrating distributed, heterogeneous and autonomous tour-
ism information systems, with different organizational levels, functions, and busi-
ness processes to freely exchange information can be technologically difficult and
costly.
Dynamic packaging applications need to access tourism data sources to query
information about flights, car rentals, hotels, and leisure activities. Data sources
can be accessed using the Internet as a communication medium. The sources can

contain hypertext markup language (HTML) pages present in Web sites, databases,
or specific formatted files, such as extensible markup language (XML), resource
description framework (RDF), or flat files. To develop a robust dynamic packag-
ing application it is important to classify each data source according to its type of
data since the type of data will influence our selection of a solution to achieve data
integration. For dynamic packaging applications, tourism data sources can host
three major types of data: (1) unstructured data, (2) semi-structured data, and (3)
structured data.
Types of Data
Data can be broken down into three broad categories (Figure 4): (1) unstructured, (2)
semi-structured, and (3) structured. Highly unstructured data comprises free-form
documents or objects of arbitrary sizes and types. At the other end of the spectrum,
structured data are what is typically found in databases. Every element of data has
an assigned format and significance.
Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is what we find in text, files, video, e-mails, reports, PowerPoint
presentations, voice mail, office memos, and images. Data can be of any type and
do not necessarily follow any format, rules, or sequence. For example, the data
present on HTML Web pages are unstructured and irregular.
Unstructured data does not readily fit into structured databases except as binary
large objects (BLOBs). Although unstructured data can have some structure—for
example, e-mails have addressees, subjects, bodies, and so forth, and HTML Web

pages have a set of predefined tags—the information is not stored in a way that
allows for easy manipulation by applications and computers.
Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data lie in between unstructured and structured data. Semi-structured
data are data that has some structure, but are not rigidly structured. This type of
data include unstructured components arranged according to some predetermined
structure that can be queried using general-purpose mechanisms.
Semi-structured data is organized into entities. Similar entities are grouped together,
but entities in the same group may not have the same attributes. The order of at-
tributes is not necessarily important and not all attributes may be required. The size
and type of same attributes in a group may differ. An example of semi-structured
data is a curriculum vita (CV). One person may have a section of previous employ-
ment, another person may have a section on research experience, and another may
have a section on teaching experience. We can also find a CV that contains two or
more of these sections.
A very good example of a semi-structured formalism is XML which is a de facto
standard for describing documents that is becoming the universal data exchange
model on the Web and for B2B transactions. XML supports the development of
semi-structured documents that contain both metadata and formatted text. Metadata is
specified using XML tags and defines the structure of documents. Without metadata,
applications would not be able to understand and parse the content of XML documents.
Compared to HTML, XML provides explicit data structuring using Document Type
Declaration (DTD) (XML, 2005) or XML Schema Definition (XSD) (World Wide
Web Consortium, 2005b) as schema definitions. Figure 4 shows the semi-structure
of an XML document containing students’ records of a university.
Structured Data
In contrast, structured data is very rigid and uses strongly typed attributes. Data
is organized in entities and similar entities are grouped together using relations or
classes. Entities (records or tuples) in the same group have the same attributes.
Structured data have been very popular since the early days of computing, and
many organizations rely on relational databases to maintain very large structured
repositories. Recent systems, such as customer relationship management (CRM),
enterprise resource planning (ERP), and content management systems (CMS) use
structured data for their underlying data model.

What Tourism Data Sources Need to be Integrated?
Data sources contain tourism information which is fundamental for dynamic packaging
applications. A data source includes both the source of data itself and the connection
information necessary for accessing the data. Data sources are uniquely identifiable
collections of stored data called data sets for which there exists programmatic access
and for which it is possible to retrieve or infer a description of the structure of the
data, that is, its schema. We have identified various tourism data sources that need
to be considered when integrating tourism information systems: flat files; HTML
Web pages; XML and RDF data sources; and relational databases.
Flat Files
A tourism data source can be a flat file that is accessible via the file system applica-
tion program interface (API). A flat file is a generic term for text file formats such
as comma separated value (CSV), tab delimited, fixed width, and so forth. Flat file
formats are supported by a wide collection of tourism information systems because
they can be used as an interoperable format for exchanging information between
different applications. In practice, flat files have proven to be very useful for allow-
ing users to share information.
However, though they are supported by many applications, flat files generally require
additional processing to be integrated seamlessly with common data formats. Since
tourism information can often be stored in flat files, dynamic packaging applica-
tions need to include methods to integrate these data into a common data model.
This requires the development of specific software application modules to access
and extract the necessary data.
Hyper Text Markup Language
With the growth of the Web, many tourism information providers already have Web
sites for storing and advertising the description of tourism services and products.
Almost all Web sites support static HTML pages accessible through a Web server via
the HTTP protocol. Dynamic packaging applications require integrating Web-based
data sources in an automated way for querying, in a uniform way, across multiple
heterogeneous Web sites, containing tourism-related information.
Extensible Markup Language
XML (XML, 2005) is a semi-structured data model that promises to accelerate the
construction of systems that integrate distributed and heterogeneous data. XML
provides a common format for data across the network and is being supported by
a vast number of data management tools. Unlike HTML, which controls how data
