### Shared Global Data Model
In the preceding step, we consolidated data into a shared global data model, represented by an e-tourism ontology. This was achieved by creating instances that populate the ontology.

### Dynamic Packaging Engine
The dynamic packaging engine leverages the information contained within the e-tourism ontology to extract knowledge and construct dynamic travel packages.

## Tourism Information System Integration
Tourism information systems are essential for providing travel agencies and customers with critical information such as flight details, accommodations, prices, and service availability. These systems deliver real-time tourism data to travel agents, customers, and other organizations.

A few years ago, e-tourism applications were primarily focused on handling transactions and managing catalogs. They automated only a small portion of the electronic transaction process, such as order taking, shipment scheduling, and customer service. E-tourism was constrained by closed markets that used incompatible protocols, preventing interoperability.

However, the business requirements for dynamic applications have evolved beyond mere transaction support. There is now a need for the interoperability and integration of heterogeneous, autonomous, and distributed tourism information systems. The goal is to provide a unified and coherent logical view of travel products, even though they are physically distributed across various tourism data sources. Historically, many tourism information systems were developed in the 1960s, when system integration was not a primary concern.

One of the key challenges for dynamic packaging applications is the integration of five major tourism information systems: Computerized Reservation Systems (CRS), Global Distribution Systems (GDS), Hotel Distribution Systems (HDS), Destination Management Systems (DMS), and Web sites (Figure 2).

### Computerized Reservation System (CRS)
A CRS is a central reservation system owned by a travel supplier. It enables travel agencies to find and book what customers are looking for, making data storage and retrieval straightforward. CRSs contain information about airline schedules, availability, fares, and related services. Some CRSs also provide services for making reservations and issuing tickets. Initially introduced in the 1950s as internal systems, they later became accessible to travel agencies and other organizations. CRSs are widely used, particularly by airlines, with an estimated 70% of all bookings made through this channel (European Travel Agents’ and Tour Operators’ Associations, 2004).

### Global Distribution System (GDS)
A GDS acts as a super switch, connecting multiple CRSs. It integrates tourism information about airlines, hotels, car rentals, cruises, and other travel products, and is primarily used by travel agents. The GDS concept was introduced in the 1960s to track airline schedules, availability, fares, and related services. GDSs automated the reservation process, significantly enhancing the productivity of travel agents. The four major GDSs are Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre, and Worldspan, which handle 90% of all U.S. ticket sales (Riebeek, 2003).

### Hotel Distribution System (HDS)
An HDS works closely with GDSs to provide the hotel industry with automated sales and booking services. HDSs can be categorized into two types: (1) directly linked to the hotel’s own booking system and then to a GDS, and (2) provided by dedicated companies that link their reservation systems to airline GDSs.

### Destination Management Systems (DMS)
DMSs offer interactively accessible information about destinations, enabling tourist destinations to disseminate information about products and services. They facilitate the planning, management, and marketing of regions as tourism entities or brands. DMSs provide guides to tourist attractions, festivals, and cultural events, along with online bookings for accommodations. They also feature weather reports, web movies, and live feeds from webcams. Notable DMSs include Tiscover (Austria) and Gulliver (Ireland).

### Direct Distribution using Web Sites
The Internet has revolutionized the distribution of tourism information and sales. Both small and large companies can use websites to access international tourism markets. Many companies, including airlines, now sell tickets directly through their websites to avoid GDS fees. A recent survey (O’Connor, 2003) found that over 95% of hotel chains have websites, with nearly 90% offering direct booking capabilities.

### Tourism Data Source Integration
The rapid growth and success of tourism data sources make it increasingly attractive to extract and integrate data for dynamic packaging applications. Manually integrating multiple heterogeneous data sources is time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. According to industry estimates, up to 70% of IT spending may be allocated to integration activities. Therefore, many organizations seek solutions to simplify the integration of information systems.

Dynamic packaging applications need to access tourism data sources to query information about flights, car rentals, hotels, and leisure activities. Data sources can be accessed via the Internet and can include HTML pages, databases, XML, RDF, and flat files. To develop a robust dynamic packaging application, it is crucial to classify each data source based on its type of data, as this will influence the choice of integration solution.

### Types of Data
Data can be classified into three broad categories: unstructured, semi-structured, and structured.

#### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data includes text, files, video, emails, reports, presentations, voice mail, office memos, and images. This data does not follow a specific format, rules, or sequence. For example, data on HTML web pages is unstructured and irregular. Unstructured data is challenging to store in traditional databases and is often stored as binary large objects (BLOBs).

#### Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data lies between unstructured and structured data. It has some structure but is not rigidly defined. Examples include XML documents, which use tags to define metadata and structure. XML supports the development of semi-structured documents that contain both metadata and formatted text, making it a de facto standard for data exchange on the Web and in B2B transactions.

#### Structured Data
Structured data is highly organized and uses strongly typed attributes. Data is organized into entities, and similar entities are grouped together using relations or classes. Entities in the same group have the same attributes. Structured data is commonly used in relational databases and is the foundation for many modern systems like CRM, ERP, and CMS.

### What Tourism Data Sources Need to be Integrated?
Tourism data sources include flat files, HTML web pages, XML and RDF data sources, and relational databases. Each type requires specific methods for integration:

- **Flat Files**: Text file formats such as CSV, tab-delimited, and fixed-width files. Flat files are widely supported but require additional processing for seamless integration.
- **HTML Web Pages**: Static HTML pages accessible via HTTP. Dynamic packaging applications need to integrate these data sources automatically.
- **XML and RDF Data Sources**: Semi-structured data models that provide a common format for data exchange.
- **Relational Databases**: Highly structured data repositories that are fundamental for many organizational systems.

By integrating these diverse data sources, dynamic packaging applications can provide a comprehensive and coherent view of travel products and services.
