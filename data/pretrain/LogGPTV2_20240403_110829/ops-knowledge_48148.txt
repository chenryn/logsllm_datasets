User: How to install and configure the MySQL database on the Linux operating system, and create new users and databases? Please describe the operation steps and precautions in detail.
Assistant: Install and configure the MySQL database: 1. Install MySQL in the Linux operating system: Use the following command to install MySQL in the Linux system: ```bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install mysql-server ``` 2. Configure MySQL : After the installation is complete, use the following command to enter the MySQL console: ```bash mysql -u root -p ``` Among them, the `-u` parameter specifies the user name, and the `-p` parameter specifies that a password needs to be entered. If it is the first time to enter the MySQL console, you need to enter the default password in the console. After entering the console, configure as follows: - Set the MySQL administrator password: Enter the following command in the MySQL console to set a new administrator password: ```mysql SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpassword '); ``` Among them, `newpassword` is the new password that the administrator needs to set. - Create a new database: Enter the following command in the MySQL console to create a new database: ```mysql CREATE DATABASE newdatabase; ``` - Create a new user: Enter the following command in the MySQL console to create a new user: ` ``mysql CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; ``` Among them, `newuser` is the name of the new user, and `password` is the password of the new user. - Authorize the new user to access the new database: Enter the following command in the MySQL console to authorize the new user to access the new database: ```mysql GRANT ALL ON newdatabase.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost'; ``` 3. Exit MySQL control Desk: After completing the configuration, enter the following command to exit the MySQL console: ```mysql quit; ``` Notes: - When installing MySQL on Linux, you need to ensure that the `apt-get` package manager has been installed. - When configuring the MySQL administrator password, you need to ensure that the new password is sufficiently secure and remember this password. - When creating new databases and users, make sure the new names and passwords are sufficiently secure and properly documented. - When authorizing new users to access new databases, make sure that authorization is limited, such as granting only read and write permissions.
