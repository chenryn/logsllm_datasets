title:botconf2017 Hunting Attacker Activities — Methods for Discovering, Detecting Lateral Movements
When attackers intrude into a network by APT attack, malware infection spreads to many hosts and servers. In incident investigations, it is important to examine what actually happened during lateral movement through log analysis and forensic investigation of infected hosts. However, in many cases, there may not be sufficient logs left on the host, which makes it difficult to reveal what attackers did on the network. Therefore, we investigated attackers’ activities after network intrusion by investigating C2 servers and decoding the malware communication. As a result, we found that there are some common patterns in lateral movement methods and tools that are often used. In addition, we analyzed the tools and Windows commands and investigated the logs recorded on the host upon execution. As a result, it was revealed that the tools’ execution logs are not recorded with the Windows default settings. This presentation will explain some attack patterns and typical tools used in lateral movement that are identified through our research. We will also demonstrate how to investigate or detect incidents where such tools and commands are used.
