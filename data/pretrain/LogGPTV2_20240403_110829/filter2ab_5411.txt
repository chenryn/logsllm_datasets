### Title: Botconf 2017 - Hunting Attacker Activities: Methods for Discovering and Detecting Lateral Movements

**Abstract:**

When attackers infiltrate a network using Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, malware can spread to multiple hosts and servers. In the context of incident investigations, it is crucial to understand the attacker's activities during lateral movement through log analysis and forensic examination of compromised hosts. However, in many cases, there may be insufficient logs available on the host, making it challenging to uncover the full extent of the attacker's actions.

To address this, we conducted an in-depth investigation into the activities of attackers post-intrusion by analyzing Command and Control (C2) servers and decoding malware communications. Our research revealed common patterns in the methods and tools used for lateral movement. Additionally, we analyzed the tools and Windows commands used by attackers and examined the logs generated on the host upon their execution. We found that, with default Windows settings, the execution logs of these tools are often not recorded.

In this presentation, we will share our findings on the common attack patterns and typical tools used in lateral movement. We will also demonstrate how to investigate and detect incidents involving such tools and commands.
