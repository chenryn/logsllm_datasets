When I pick Settings in the dropdown menu, profile.json opens in Visual
Studio. This is slow. I would like to open it in a smaller/faster editor. I
suppose it opens in VS due to my windows file extension settings for .json
files. I don't wan't to change this setting, but I would like a seperate
setting where I can choose my editor.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
With the new feature:
  1. I will somehow pick editor for editing settings.
  2. When I choose to edit settings, profile.json opens in the editor from 1)
