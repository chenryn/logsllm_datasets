When I select "Settings" from the dropdown menu, `profile.json` opens in Visual Studio. This process is quite slow, and I would prefer to open it in a smaller, faster editor. I believe this behavior is due to my Windows file extension settings for `.json` files. However, I do not want to change this global setting; instead, I would like a separate setting where I can specify a different editor for this specific use case.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

With the new feature:

1. I will be able to select a specific editor for editing settings.
2. When I choose to edit settings, `profile.json` will open in the editor I specified in step 1.

This approach will allow me to maintain my current global file association settings while providing a more efficient and tailored experience for editing `profile.json`.
