  * Electron version:1.4.3
  * Operating system:OSX
After signing an app for the mac app store the app crashes. I've been able to
trace the issue to /Contents/Frameworks/Electron
Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron Helper . Before signing this works fine and
my app runs normally. However after signing it just hangs.
When running Electron Helper manually from the command line after signing I
get the error _Illegal instruction: 4_
This error also occurs on 1.4.2
