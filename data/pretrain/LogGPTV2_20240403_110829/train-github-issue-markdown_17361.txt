# Environment
    Windows build number: 18363.900
    PowerToys version: 0.19.2
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
Use FancyZones' window arrangement utility by holding Shift while dragging a
window. This might be specific to using a custom layout, I don't know yet.
# Expected behavior
If you specify more or less than the default space around zones, that is how
it should appear when you use FancyZones. It should retain the same behavior.
# Actual behavior
After some time of using Windows, the space around zones gets reset to the
default, 16. The layout options also shows that the space around zones has
been reset.

Just to highlight the option I am referencing, I will provide more
clarification if there is any confusion.
