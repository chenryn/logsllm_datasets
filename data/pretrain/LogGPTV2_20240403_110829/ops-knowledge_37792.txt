User: I have a c-program which includes a make file that works fine on unix systems. Although I would like to compile the program for windows using this make file, how can i go around doing that?
Additionally I have python scripts that call this c-program using ctypes, I don't imagine I will have to much of an issue getting ctypes working on windows but i heard its possible to include all the python and c scripts in one .exe for windows, has anyone heard of that?
Assistant: Answer to your first paragraph: Use MinGW for the compiler (google it, there is a -w64 version if you need that) and MSYS for a minimal environment including shell tools the Makefile could need.
