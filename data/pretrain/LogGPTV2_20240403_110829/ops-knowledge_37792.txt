To compile your C program on Windows using the existing Makefile, you can use MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) as your compiler. For a more comprehensive environment that includes shell tools and utilities, consider using MSYS2, which provides a Unix-like environment on Windows. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install MinGW-w64 and MSYS2**:
   - Download and install MSYS2 from the official website: [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
   - Open the MSYS2 terminal and update the package database and core system packages:
     ```sh
     pacman -Syu
     ```
   - Install the MinGW-w64 toolchain:
     ```sh
     pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
     ```

2. **Configure Your Environment**:
   - Ensure that the `mingw-w64` binaries are in your system's PATH. You can do this by adding the following to your system's PATH environment variable:
     ```sh
     C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
     ```

3. **Run the Makefile**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing your Makefile.
   - Run the Makefile using the `make` command in the MSYS2 terminal:
     ```sh
     make
     ```

Regarding your second question about bundling Python scripts and the C program into a single `.exe` file for Windows, you can use tools like `PyInstaller` or `cx_Freeze`. These tools allow you to create a standalone executable that includes both your Python code and the compiled C library.

Here’s how you can do it with `PyInstaller`:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   - You can install `PyInstaller` using pip:
     ```sh
     pip install pyinstaller
     ```

2. **Create the Executable**:
   - Suppose your main Python script is `main.py` and it uses the C library. You can create the executable with the following command:
     ```sh
     pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=ctypes main.py
     ```
   - The `--onefile` option creates a single executable file.
   - The `--hidden-import=ctypes` option ensures that the `ctypes` module is included in the bundle.

3. **Include the C Library**:
   - If your C library is a shared object (`.dll` on Windows), you need to ensure it is in the same directory as your Python script when creating the executable. `PyInstaller` will automatically include it if it is referenced correctly in your script.

By following these steps, you should be able to compile your C program on Windows and create a standalone executable that includes both your Python and C code.
