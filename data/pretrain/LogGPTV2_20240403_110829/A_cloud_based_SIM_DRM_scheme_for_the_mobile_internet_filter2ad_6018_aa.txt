With the rapid development and growth of the mobile industry, a considerable amount of mobile applications and services are
available, which involve Internet scale data collections. Meanwhile, it has a tremendous impact on digital content providers as well
as the mobile industry that a large number of digital content have been pirated and illegally distributed. Digital Rights Management
(DRM) aims at protecting digital contents from being abused through regulating their usage. Unfortunately, to the best of our
knowledge, fewer of these DRM schemes are concerned with the cost of the servers in a DRM system when the number of users
scales up, and consider beneﬁts of content providers who can be seen as tenants of a content server. In this paper, we propose CS-
DRM, a cloud-based SIM DRM scheme, for the mobile Internet. The SIM card is introduced into CS-DRM to both reduce the cost
and provide higher security. Also, the characteristics of cloud computing enable CS-DRM to bring beneﬁts for content providers,
and well satisfy the performance requirements with low cost when the number of users increases signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, we
have implemented a prototype of our DRM scheme, which demonstrates that CS-DRM is eﬃcient, secure, and practicable.
1. Motivation
With the rapid development and growth of the mobile
industry, a considerable amount of mobile applications and
services are available, which involve extremely large, Internet
scale data collections, for example, image, e-books, audio,
and video. As a result, users are capable of sharing and
distributing digital content easily through mobile Internet.
However, a large number of digital content have been pirated
and illegally distributed, which has a tremendous impact on
digital content providers as well as the mobile industry.
Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a mechanism which
protects digital content from being abused through regulat-
ing its usage. A DRM scheme is a model of DRM and consists
of related components, protocols, and algorithms (the formal
deﬁnition of a DRM scheme is given in Section 2.2.1). A
DRM system is an implementation of a DRM scheme. In the
context of a DRM system, only an authorized user, who has
obtained a license, can access the digital content according to
the rights information deﬁned in the license.
Current DRM schemes can be summarized into the
following two categories.
Device-Based DRM. In a device-based DRM scheme, such as
OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) DRM [1], and Microsoft DRM
[2], the security comes from mandatory usage of customized
players (e.g., Windows Media Player 10 Mobile for Pocket
PC) and unique global device identiﬁers (e.g., IMEI—
International Mobile Equipment Identiﬁer). However, this
kind of DRM scheme is constrained by its inﬂexibility,
especially in the mobile Internet. For example, a user, in
reality, may change or switch her/his mobile devices, but
cannot use the licenses bought before because the new
mobile device fails to pass the veriﬁcation of the DRM
system.

Smart Card-Based DRM. In order to overcome the inﬂex-
ibility of device-based DRM schemes,
the smart card-
based DRM scheme is proposed. A “smart card” is a chip
card with storage, identiﬁcation, and encryption/decryption
capabilities [3] and is the core component of the scheme. The
security of this kind of DRM scheme rests on key generation-
related algorithms and protocols protected by the smart card.
However, there are security issues, such as imposter attacks
[4, 5], in some existing smart card-based DRM schemes.
Meanwhile, some solutions (e.g., [6]) are proposed to solve
these issues, but the complexity and cost of this kind of DRM
schemes dramatically increase. Especially, existing smart
card-based DRM schemes are uneconomic and inconvenient
in the mobile Internet. In detail, besides a smart card, each
mobile device needs a smart card reader [5, 6]. When a user
wants to access digital content, a smart card and a smart
card reader have to be carried and connected to a mobile
device.
Taking note of shortcomings of the smart card-based
DRM scheme, for the mobile Internet, we propose SIM DRM
(SIM card-based DRM system) in Section 2.2.2, which uses a
SIM card instead of a smart card. It overcomes the deﬁciency
of existing smart card-based DRM schemes.
According to the investigation report on the China
mobile Internet and 3G networks by CNNIC [7], the number
of mobile Internet users has reached 155 million in China by
late June 2009, 46% of the mobile phone users, and with the
proportion of mobile Internet users increased by 6.5% within
six months. A large amount of mobile media, such as mobile
video and music, are downloaded or enjoyed online. On one
hand, large numbers of mobile content providers emerge,
such as Arphiola and telecomCONTENT. Speciﬁcally for the
domain of DRM, these content providers may upload digital
content with diﬀerent formats using divergent channels to
the content server. However, two pivotal requirements need
to be concerned by both content providers and the content
server. First, the content server of a DRM system can only
deal with and encrypt some certain formats of contents so
that these contents can be used under the framework of
a DRM scheme. Preliminary works for contents, such as
content editing and format conversion, have to be done by
content providers themselves. However, it is clearly a burden
for content providers. Second, as a tenant of the content
server, each content provider uploads digital content to the
content server and derives beneﬁts from its contents being
consumed by users. Since contents of each content provider
are all stored and handled in the same place, the data security,
sharing, and isolation among content providers becomes a
rather important issue. Fortunately, the cloud environment
is one of the best solutions. In a cloud, the content server
provides rich and powerful services for handling contents.
Each content provider only needs to use these services
to do complex preliminary works without any extra cost.
Meanwhile, the virtualization technology used above the
infrastructure of the cloud guarantees the data security,
sharing, and isolation among tenants.
On the other hand, while the stable growth of the
mobile Internet active users brings huge economic interests,
the performance of the mobile applications and services
becomes more and more important. The low access speed
and long response time have been the most important factors
limiting the development of the mobile Internet, which is
voted by 55% of mobile Internet users [7]. Speciﬁcally in
a DRM system, with the number of active users scaling up,
mass of the data requests and data operations place a heavy
burden on the DRM system. The capabilities of computation,
storage as well as the performance of data management
system are main constraints on the performance of the
whole DRM system. The existing DRM schemes are still
required to purchase huge amount of equipment and
perform maintenance, which is a large investment and takes
high daily expenses, when the number of user visits increases.
The huge capability of computation and storage of the cloud
environment makes the cloud one of the best solutions
for satisfying performance requirements of the entire DRM
system when the number of user visits grows to inﬁnity.
The above situations call for a new DRM scheme which
is low-cost, ﬂexible, secure, eﬃcient, and practicable. In
addressing this problem, we propose a novel DRM scheme,
called CS-DRM, which is a Cloud-based SIM DRM scheme
for media protection in the mobile Internet. In summary, our
main contributions are as follows.
(i) We propose CS-DRM, a 4-tuple model, in which
the usage of a SIM card instead of a smart card not
only reduces the unnecessary cost, but also provides
higher security. In addition, the cloud computing is
introduced in the scheme to provide more eﬃcient
and higher quality services.
(ii) We propose a practicable use case for our CS-
DRM scheme. It is a concrete process which consists
of ﬁve phases, that is, preparation phase, rights
customization phase, license acquisition phase, play
phase, and download/upload phase.
(iii) We have implemented a prototype of our proposed
scheme, called Phosphor, which demonstrates that
CS-DRM is eﬃcient, secure, and practicable.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some
preliminaries are introduced in Section 2. We detail the CS-
DRM scheme in Section 3. In Section 4, we focus on the CS-
DRM use case. Security issues and system characteristics of
the CS-DRM are analyzed and discussed in Section 5. The
implementation details of Phosphor are stated in Section 6.
Section 7 reports the results of our experiments and analyzes
the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of our scheme. The related
works are reviewed in Section 8. Finally, we conclude this
paper in Section 9.
2. Preliminaries
In this section, we state the preliminaries of CS-DRM. First,
we discuss diﬀerences between a SIM card and a smart card.
Second, we elaborate on the concepts of a common DRM
scheme, SIM DRM, and cloud computing. Finally, we give
some fundamental statements and explain the symbols used
in the rest of the paper.

2.1. Diﬀerences between a SIM Card and a Smart Card. A
smart card follows the Standard ISO 7816 [3] which deﬁnes
the physical and electrical characteristics of smart cards. A
SIM card is produced according to the speciﬁcation GSM
11.11 [8] and GSM 11.14 [9] besides the standard ISO 7816.
GSM 11.11 deﬁnes the interface between the SIM card and
the mobile device as well as the interaction between the SIM
card and the mobile operator. GSM 11.14 describes the SIM
Application Toolkit which is a set of applications and related
procedures used in a GSM session.
A SIM card distinguishes itself by the following three
points. Firstly, a SIM card has the proactive SIM mechanism
[9] which allows a SIM card to send proactive commands.
In this way, a SIM card can do many things that normal
smart cards could not do, such as proactive information
synchronization between the SIM card and the mobile
operator. Secondly, the A3, A5, A8 and A38 algorithms [8]
embedded in the SIM card can help SIM card authenticate
the subscriber, encrypt/decrypt data and generate a secret
key. Finally, a SIM card owns a secure ﬁle system which
has a complete access control mechanism [3, 8]. All these
characteristics make the SIM card more eﬃcient and secure
than the normal smart card.
2.2. Concepts
2.2.1. DRM Scheme. Formally, a DRM scheme is a 3-tuple,
shown as follows:
DRM = (C, P , A),
(1)
where C is a set of main components, P is a set of protocols
which are in charge of communication and data transmission
among components, and A is a set of auxiliary algorithms in
the scheme. However, the denotation of each tuple could be
diﬀerent depending on diﬀerent schemes. Taking the OMA
DRM scheme as an example, C contains ﬁve components—
DRM Agent, Content Issuer, Rights Issuer, User and Oﬀ-
device Storage; ROAP and other protocols form P ; A
consists of kinds of hash algorithms as well as symmetric and
asymmetric encryption/decryption algorithms.
2.2.2. SIM DRM. As the name suggests, a SIM DRM scheme,
abbreviated as SIM DRM, is a DRM scheme based on the
SIM card. Formally, SIM DRM is also a 3-tuple (C, P , A)
where a SIM card, as a component, is added to C. Meanwhile,
some protocols and algorithms specially designed for SIM
DRM are added to P and A, such as the LSWP protocol and
the License-Generation algorithm presented in sequel.
2.2.3. Cloud Computing. The cloud computing provides
services, computation, and storage from a remote and
centralized facility or contractor [10, 11]. In a cloud, data
can be easily and ubiquitously accessed. One of the most
important characteristics of cloud computing is its pay-
as-you-go manner. It means that users only need to rent
corresponding services provided by cloud computing and
pay for the actual utilization of services, rather than buy
software and physical hardware which users may consider too
expensive.
A cloud system is a system implementing cloud com-
puting. Without ambiguity, a cloud system is abbreviated
as a cloud in the rest of the paper. A cloud refers to not
only application services delivered over the Internet, but also
the hardware and system software in the system. As shown
in Figure 1, the typical architecture of a cloud consists of
three layers. The infrastructure layer includes the physical
infrastructure and the virtual infrastructure. The former is
composed of tens of thousands of commercial machines; the
latter contains network, computation, and storage, which
communicates with physical servers by uniﬁed interfaces.
In the cloud, the infrastructure can also be seen as a
service provided to customers. Some businesses are based on
infrastructure services such as Amazon. The platform layer,
for example, Google Application Engine (GAE), provides
platform services to develop new applications. Above the
platform layer, all kinds of custom application services
4
EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking
comprise the application layer. For example, in the CS-DRM
scheme described later, the license service and content service
are established within the application layer.
Any client connected to a cloud, via wired or wireless
means, is called a cloud client. Correspondingly, the cloud
is also called the backend.
2.3. Fundamental Statements. As known to all, SIM cards
are issued by mobile operators which have mobile networks
and a large number of users. We have some fundamental
statements as follows.
2.3.1. Trust in the Mobile Operator. The mobile operator
is trustworthy. If the mobile operator fabricates facts or
divulges user privacy so that the interests of mobile users are
undermined, the mobile operator will lose the reputation,
credit and market, which the mobile operator could not
aﬀord.
2.3.2. Cooperation with the Mobile Operator. It is of practical
signiﬁcance to cooperate with the mobile operator. First, a
SIM card issued by the mobile operator is of vital importance
for a client. It is the foundation of algorithms and protocols
for the security of CS-DRM. Since SIM cards used in CS-
DRM are provided by the mobile operator, we need to
cooperate with the mobile operator naturally. Second, the
servers of CS-DRM need corresponding algorithms and data
from the mobile operator, such as A5/A8 algorithms and Ki
of the SIM card [8]. Please note that Ki must be safe, which is
a secret key stored in the SIM card and the mobile operator. It
only can be acquired from the system of the mobile operator
by a special interface. For the privacy and the security of
this acquisition process, the hash value of the International
Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is required as a parameter
of the interface. Third, the mobile operators have the mobile
network and huge number of users which are two crucial
factors of a successful business system of CS-DRM.
For the convenience of presentation, some symbols used
in the remainder of the paper are listed in Table 1.
3. The CS-DRM Scheme
In this section, we propose the CS-DRM scheme which is
diﬀerent from existing DRM schemes. The deﬁnition of the
CS-DRM scheme is presented at ﬁrst. Then, we elaborate on
its elements one by one. The original idea of the CS-DRM
scheme is presented in [12].
3.1. Deﬁnition. A CS-DRM scheme, abbreviated as CS-
DRM, is a 4-tuple
CS-DRM = (E, S, P, A),
(2)
where E is the set of entities in the cloud client, S the set of
application services based on cloud computing, P the set of
protocols among E∪ S (E∪ S denotes all elements in both E
and S), and A the set of auxiliary algorithms used in P.
Users of a system implementing the CS-DRM scheme
utilize or enjoy digital content by a frontend, that is, a cloud
