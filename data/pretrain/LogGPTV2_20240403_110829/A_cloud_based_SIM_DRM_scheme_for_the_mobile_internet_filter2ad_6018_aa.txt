### Abstract

With the rapid growth of the mobile industry, a significant number of mobile applications and services have emerged, involving large-scale data collections. However, this has led to widespread piracy and illegal distribution of digital content, impacting both content providers and the mobile industry. Digital Rights Management (DRM) aims to protect digital content by regulating its usage. Despite this, existing DRM schemes often overlook the cost implications for servers as the number of users scales up and do not adequately consider the benefits for content providers. In this paper, we propose CS-DRM, a cloud-based SIM DRM scheme for the mobile internet. By integrating SIM cards, CS-DRM reduces costs and enhances security. Additionally, the characteristics of cloud computing enable CS-DRM to provide efficient and cost-effective solutions for content providers, even as the user base grows. We have implemented a prototype, Phosphor, which demonstrates the efficiency, security, and practicality of CS-DRM.

### 1. Motivation

The rapid development of the mobile industry has led to a proliferation of mobile applications and services, involving large-scale data collections such as images, e-books, audio, and video. While this has enabled easy sharing and distribution of digital content, it has also resulted in widespread piracy and illegal distribution, significantly impacting content providers and the mobile industry. Digital Rights Management (DRM) aims to protect digital content by regulating its usage. A DRM scheme consists of components, protocols, and algorithms, and a DRM system is an implementation of a DRM scheme. In a DRM system, only authorized users who have obtained a license can access the digital content according to the rights defined in the license.

Current DRM schemes can be categorized into two types:

- **Device-Based DRM:** Schemes like OMA DRM and Microsoft DRM rely on customized players and unique global device identifiers. However, they lack flexibility, especially in the mobile internet, as users cannot transfer licenses between devices.
- **Smart Card-Based DRM:** These schemes use smart cards with storage, identification, and encryption/decryption capabilities. While they offer better security, they are expensive and inconvenient, requiring each mobile device to have a smart card reader.

To address these limitations, we propose CS-DRM, a cloud-based SIM DRM scheme for the mobile internet. By using SIM cards instead of smart cards, CS-DRM reduces costs and enhances security. The cloud environment provides efficient and high-quality services, making CS-DRM scalable and cost-effective.

### 2. Preliminaries

#### 2.1. Differences Between a SIM Card and a Smart Card

A smart card follows the ISO 7816 standard, defining its physical and electrical characteristics. A SIM card, in addition to ISO 7816, adheres to GSM 11.11 and GSM 11.14, which define the interface between the SIM card and the mobile device, and the SIM Application Toolkit, respectively. 

Key features of a SIM card include:
- **Proactive SIM Mechanism:** Allows the SIM card to send proactive commands, enabling functionalities like information synchronization.
- **Embedded Algorithms:** A3, A5, A8, and A38 algorithms for authentication, encryption/decryption, and key generation.
- **Secure File System:** Complete access control mechanism, enhancing security.

#### 2.2. Concepts

##### 2.2.1. DRM Scheme
A DRM scheme is formally defined as a 3-tuple:
\[ \text{DRM} = (C, P, A) \]
where \( C \) is a set of main components, \( P \) is a set of communication and data transmission protocols, and \( A \) is a set of auxiliary algorithms.

##### 2.2.2. SIM DRM
SIM DRM is a DRM scheme based on the SIM card, also defined as a 3-tuple:
\[ \text{SIM DRM} = (C, P, A) \]
with a SIM card added to \( C \), and specific protocols and algorithms for SIM DRM added to \( P \) and \( A \).

##### 2.2.3. Cloud Computing
Cloud computing provides services, computation, and storage from a remote and centralized facility. It operates on a pay-as-you-go model, allowing users to rent services and pay for actual utilization. The typical architecture of a cloud includes three layers: infrastructure, platform, and application.

#### 2.3. Fundamental Statements

- **Trust in the Mobile Operator:** The mobile operator is considered trustworthy, as compromising user privacy would result in significant reputational and financial losses.
- **Cooperation with the Mobile Operator:** Cooperation is essential for accessing SIM card-related algorithms and data, and leveraging the mobile network and user base.

For clarity, the following symbols are used in the paper:
- \( K_i \): Secret key stored in the SIM card.
- \( A3(·) \): Authentication algorithm.
- \( A5(·) \): Encryption/decryption algorithm.
- \( A8(·) \): Key generation algorithm.
- \( A38(·) \): Combined A3 and A8 functions.
- \( K_{cek} \): Key for encrypting digital content.
- \( EK \): Encrypted \( K_{cek} \).
- \( AUK(·) \): Algorithm for generating UK.
- \( E_k(·) \): Symmetric encryption with key \( k \).
- \( D_{E_k}(·) \): Symmetric decryption with key \( k \).
- \( H(·) \): Public one-way hash function.
- \( GetKI(·) \): Function for fetching \( K_i \) in the license service.
- \( \parallel \): Concatenation operation.

### 3. The CS-DRM Scheme

#### 3.1. Definition
CS-DRM is defined as a 4-tuple:
\[ \text{CS-DRM} = (E, S, P, A) \]
where \( E \) is the set of entities in the cloud client, \( S \) is the set of application services based on cloud computing, \( P \) is the set of protocols among \( E \cup S \), and \( A \) is the set of auxiliary algorithms used in \( P \).

Users of a CS-DRM system access or enjoy digital content through a frontend (cloud client) after purchasing the necessary licenses. The backend (cloud) provides the necessary services and infrastructure.
