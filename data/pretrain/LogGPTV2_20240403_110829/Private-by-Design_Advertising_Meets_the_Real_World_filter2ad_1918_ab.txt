INTRODUCTION
1.1 On the Internet Someone Knows You Are a Dog
Third-party tracking of users is widespread and increasing [43]. One of the
primary purposes of user tracking is behavioral advertising. Although many
companies that participate in tracking and behavioral proﬁling claim to not
gather Personally Identifying Information (PII), it is often easy to link track-
ing information with PII [42]. While tracking has been going on for a number of
years, the public awareness of this as a privacy problem has recently skyrock-
eted. At the same time, literally dozens of behavioral targeting companies have
emerged, all vying with each other for the number and quality of data sources,
and for their ability to target users based on this data. Public awareness of
online privacy erosion has already had some direct impact on the advertising
ecosystem: recently the start-ups Phorm and NebuAd were heavily criticized
for their targeting practices and sloppy opt-in or opt-out policies [39]. Arguably
most objections were triggered by the threat of “wiretapping” and “deep packet
inspection”, but nevertheless these concerns were enough to cancel or delay pi-
lot deployments and cause serious damage to the reputations of these compa-
nies. Today, we are approaching the same level of concern over online tracking,
leading, for instance, to the Do-Not-Track (DNT) initiative launched by the Fed-
eral Trace Commission (FTC) and to proposals for a Do-Not-Track registry [56].
However, DNT provides only an illusion of privacy while destroying targeting
utility, and as a result has come to stand for “Do-Not-Target”. Not surprisingly,
1
DNT has not gained a lot of traction with the public, and ad networks are ac-
tively ignoring it.
1.2 Private-by-Design Advertising
Several research projects have proposed “private-by-design” behavioral adver-
tising systems (Adnostic [58], RePriv [29], Privad [34], MobiAd [36], and Pi-
CoDa [49]). Rather than simply opting out of tracking, or pushing for data-
protection after the fact, they argue that privacy can be embedded from the
start and propose alternative advertising technologies that allow for behavioral
targeting without revealing user online behavior or user interest proﬁles to the
ad network.
Although the existing private-by-design advertising systems differ in signif-
icant ways, they all share several key design components. All systems propose
a software agent that runs at the client and generates a user proﬁle. All systems
at least share the privacy goal that this proﬁle not be revealed. All these designs
propose that the broker transmit multiple ads to the client, not all of which
match the user proﬁle. For instance, the ads may all be within a given interest
category. From among these ads, the client then locally selects the ads which
best match the user proﬁle, and displays these to the user. The client reports
the result of this selection anonymously, and without letting the broker link to-
gether different components of the user proﬁle. The key privacy mechanisms
are therefore anonymity and unlinkability.
The private-by-design ad systems are meant to be realistic alternatives that
industry ﬁnds attractive. None of these systems, however, adequately explore
2
how to operate the auctions that are critical to current advertising systems.
Without this component, these systems leave unanswered what revenue the
broker (i.e. an ad network like Google) can earn, thereby reducing the likelihood
that a private-by-design advertising system will be of commercial interest. In
this thesis, we address the challenge of running auctions that leverage a user
proﬁle for ad ranking while keeping the user proﬁle private.
Each of the systems cited above claims to be practical in that they provide
both good privacy and good utility at reasonable cost. However, none of the
proposed designs have been deployed and evaluated in real-life settings. This
thesis attempts to ﬁll this gap and answer a number of fundamental questions:
“Is private-by-design advertising really practical?”, “Can relevant ads be de-
livered?”, “Is it possible to adequately measure the systems without infring-
ing on user privacy?”, “Will unforeseen devils in the details kill the system?”
To do so, we built, deployed, and evaluated a fully functional prototype of a
private-by-design ad system based on the Privad design [33]. Our deployment
delivered functional ads in the sense that the ads were targeted to user inter-
ests, displayed on publisher webpages, linked to real shopping websites, and
in fact led to actual purchases. Side-by-side with Privad, we also deployed a
distributed differentially-private user analytics system, PDDP [19], that served
as our primary means of gathering experimental data.
1.3 Contributions
Altogether, this thesis makes the following contributions towards transforming
private-by-design advertising from a theoretical abstraction to a practical sys-
3
tem that both ﬁts within the current economical model and is a demonstrably
viable alternative to the current non-private designs:
• It proposes two new private-by-design auction mechanisms, and a third
based on the previous work but substantially improved.
• It analyzes the trade-offs between these three designs in terms of privacy
properties, auction properties, and fraud resistance.
• It analyzes the effect of bid churn and auction timing on revenue and ad
ranking using a trace of Bing search advertising auctions, and uses this
analysis to argue for the feasibility of the solutions.
• It presents the design and analysis of the ﬁrst deployed fully-functional
In so doing it preliminarily shows that
private-by-design ad system.
private-by-design behavioral advertising is practical.
• It presents our experience in running a relatively large-scale user-centric
research experiment with differentially private analytics as the primary
means of gathering system and user data. It shows that such an approach
is feasible.
• It analyzes the practical implications of the privacy deﬁcits accumulated
as a result of differentially private data collection. It concludes that dif-
ferential privacy is a poor model for understanding privacy loss in our
deployment (too pessimistic), and that its noise-adding mechanism alone
is too weak to be practical.
Some of the material presented in this thesis was previously published in
a technical report [33], a series of conference papers [34, 54, 19], or is under
submission to a conference at the time of this writing [53].

1.4 Structure of this Thesis
This thesis has two parts. The ﬁrst part addresses the challenges of running
private-by-design auctions that leverage user proﬁles for ad ranking while
keeping the user proﬁle private. It deﬁnes the problem, broadly explores the
solution space, and discusses the pros and cons of the proposed solutions. The
second part presents an effort to build and evaluate a fully functional prototype
of a practical private-by-design ad system at a reasonably large scale.
Part I contains Chapters 2 through 5. Chapter 2 provides background on on-
line ad auctions in the current advertising systems. It also outlines an abstract
alternative advertising model that captures key aspects of the existing proposals
for private-by-design advertising. Chapter 3 describes the design goals of the
auction component in the private-by-design advertising system.
It then pro-
poses there solutions and discusses each in detail. Chapter 4 analyzes the three
auction designs in terms of privacy, auction quality, and attacks on the auction
component. Chapter 5 analyzes the performance of the proposed solutions us-
ing data from Microsoft Bing advertising auctions.
Part II contains Chapters 6 through 9. Chapter 6 gives a broad overview
of the Privad architecture and discusses the privacy guarantees provided by
the system. It also outlines the design of the PDDP system, which enables dif-
ferentially private data collection in distributed settings. Finally, it describes
previous attempts at building and deploying a private-by-design advertising
system. The experimental Privad prototype we have built is described in detail
in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 describes our experience in deploying the Privad proto-
type and presents results obtained during the deployment. Chapter 9 explores
5
the extent to which a differentially private data collection system can be used
to understand what is going on behind the scenes in the private-by-design ad
deployment. It also looks at the privacy deﬁcits accumulated as a result of our
analysis and studies the privacy implications for the end users.
Chapters 1 and 10 fall outside of the two Parts. Chapter 1 is the introduction.
Chapter 10 concludes the thesis and outlines directions for future work.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In order for the private-by-design advertising to become a viable alternative
to the current tracking systems, it has to operate within the existing business
model. In particular, it must preserve the auction mechanism that allows adver-
tisers to compete for ad slots and also determines revenues generated by the ad
networks.
The most common pricing model for online advertising systems today is Pay
Per Click1 (PPC): the advertiser does not pay the broker for showing an ad to
a user, rather it pays only if the user clicks on an ad. The broker selects which
ads to show through an auction whereby advertisers bid against each other. In
a PPC system, the broker maximizes revenue by ranking the competing ads ac-
cording to the Bid ⇥ ClickProbability product, and transmitting the highest rank-
ing ads to the client where they are displayed in rank order. Of course, the bro-
ker does not know the precise click probability for every ad. Rather, the broker
tries to predict the click probability as best it can. This prediction is based on a
number of inter-related factors such as the ad keywords, the landing page key-
words, the user search terms or keywords associated with the web-page being
browsed, stored user characteristics, and so on. For example, Microsoft incor-
porates at least seven and perhaps many more such factors in its Bing search
advertising auctions.
The user proﬁle has a strong effect on click probability. To give a simple
example, say a user searches for “running shoes”. Whether the user is a man
or a woman, or prefers brand-name products or discount products, plays an
1Also called Cost per Click (CPC).
8
important role in which running shoes ad he or she is more likely to click on.
In a private-by-design advertising system, the broker has no access to the user
proﬁle: if the auction takes place at the broker in the same way that it does
today, then the user proﬁle will not be factored into the result. Therefore the
highest Bid ⇥ ClickProbability ads will not be selected, leading to less revenue
than should otherwise be possible.
In this part of the thesis, we characterize the problem of running an auction
that leverages the user proﬁle while preventing the broker from reconstructing
it, and propose three basic solutions. Taking a pragmatic approach to the prob-
lem, we look for a good trade-off between strict privacy guarantees and practi-
cal business and deployment concerns. As such, we explore the pros and cons
of the three approaches in terms of not just privacy (both user and advertiser),
but also revenue, overhead, and vulnerability to attack. We use around 2TB of
auction traces from Microsoft Bing to guide and validate the design choices.
The remainder of this chapter describes how current online advertising sys-
tems such as Google and Microsoft work. It then outlines an abstract alternative
advertising model that captures key aspects of the existing proposals for private-
by-design advertising. Finally, it provides an overview of the related work. In the
process, we establish terminology and deﬁne the basic components.
2.1 Current Second Price Ad Systems
In current ad systems [31, 46, 22], advertisers submit ads to a broker. Associated
with each ad is a bid, one or more keywords, and optionally some targeting in-
formation like demographics (location, age, gender) or interests. When a client
9
computer does a search or receives a web page with adboxes (space to place an
ad), the broker identiﬁes the ads that match the search terms or keywords asso-
ciated with the web page, and runs an auction. The auction ranks the selected
ads in order of highest expected revenue (Bid ⇥ ClickProbability), and transmits
some number of ads to the client. As already discussed, many factors are con-
sidered in estimating click probability. We refer to all of these factors taken
together as a quality score Q, where a higher value means higher expected click
probability. Denoting bid as B, the ranking then is in order of the product (B⇥Q).
When a user clicks on an ad, the ad ID is transmitted to the broker. The
broker computes Cost per Click (CPC), that is, the price that the advertiser must
pay, using a generalised second-price auction [25]. In this approach, the price paid
is pegged to the bid of the ad that is ranked immediately below the clicked ad.
To give a simple example, suppose that advertiser A is willing to pay as much
as $5 for a click, and advertiser B is willing to pay $10. In a second-price auction,
A could go ahead and bid $5 and B could bid $10. B would win, but would only
pay the so-called second price, which is only incrementally more than A’s bid,
say $5.01.
Second-price auctions allow bidders to bid the maximum that they are will-
ing to pay, rather than frequently modify their bid in search of the value incre-
mentally higher than the next lower bidder. Speciﬁcally, the CPC is computed
as:
where Bn and Qn are the bid and quality score of the next lower ranked ad, and
Qc is the quality score of clicked ad. This CPC formula captures the minimum
amount the advertiser would have had to bid to beat the next-ranked ad in a
CPC = Bn Qn
Qc!

ﬁrst-price auction. Note that it prevents the advertiser from paying more than
it bid, even when the next-ranked in fact bid more.
2.2 Abstract Private-by-Design Advertising
Although the private-by-design advertising systems cited in Section 1.2 differ
in signiﬁcant ways, they all share several key design components. All systems
propose a software agent that runs at the client and generates a user proﬁle. All
systems at least share the privacy goal that this proﬁle not be revealed. All these
designs propose that the broker transmit multiple ads to the client, not all of
which match the user proﬁle. In this section, we describe an abstract private-by-
design advertising system that captures key aspects of the existing proposals.
The principle components of the abstract private-by-design advertising sys-
tem include those of today’s tracking systems, the broker, the client, and the ad-
vertiser. A user proﬁle is stored at the client (i.e., the user’s computer, or a device
trusted by the user: the distinction is not important for our purposes). Each
ad is associated with targeting information. The user proﬁle is deﬁned as that
information needed to determine how well an ad’s targeting matches the user.
To produce the user proﬁle, the client monitors user behavior (i.e., the user’s
searching, browsing, purchases, and so on).
The privacy goals of the abstract private-by-design system are:
• Anonymity: the broker cannot associate any unit of learned informa-
tion with any user personally identiﬁable information (including network
address), and
11
Figure 2.1: Abstract private-by-design advertising system. All communi-
cations between the client and the broker are relayed by an
anonymizing proxy. [x] denotes encryption of x.
• Unlinkability: the broker cannot associate separate units of learned
information with a single (anonymous) client. This prevents a broker from
building up a user proﬁle, and then associating it with a known user using
externally gathered knowledge.
The broker is assumed to be honest-but-curious. We believe that this is close
to reality (brokers like Google can generally be trusted to do what they claim
they are doing). Nevertheless, we believe it is wise to avoid making it possible
for brokers to obtain high-value information through hard-to-detect cheating,
and our designs reﬂect this belief.
Figure 2.1 illustrates the basic architecture and message exchange of an ab-
stract private-by-design advertising system. The network layer address of all
messages is anonymized, which we represent as an anonymizing proxy. Mes-
sages are encrypted to prevent viewing by the anonymizing proxy. The client
requests a set of ads of a given type (i.e. for a given product or service). The
request must be generic enough that a substantial set of clients can have le-
gitimately made the request (i.e. K-anonymity and L-diversity). A set of ads
matching the type, each with identiﬁer A and associated targeting information,
are transmitted to the client and stored. When an adbox is presented to the
client, for instance on a web page, the client selects among the stored ads those
12
BrokerAds Request: [ad type]Click/View: [A, URL]Ads: [Ad, A, target]ClientProxythat best match the user proﬁle, and puts them in the ad box for viewing by
the user. The client reports the view and click of the ad A on a webpage with
the given URL. There is nothing in the messages that allows the broker to link
different messages as coming from the same user.
This private-by-design model has two necessary channels of communica-
tions between the client and the broker, ad delivery, and view and click report-
ing. Both channels present opportunities for the broker to learn information
contained in user proﬁles, and current private-by-design advertising systems
protect these channels. Any new information that must be conveyed for the
