Hi,
I'm working with histogram aggregation but there is something strange with
keys.  
For instance (cf :
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html):
If I use this request :  
{  
"aggs" : {  
"prices" : {  
"histogram" : {  
"field" : "price",  
"interval" : 50  
}  
}  
}  
}
I obtain something like this :  
{  
"aggregations": {  
"prices" : {  
"buckets": [  
{  
"key_as_string" : "0",  
"key": 0,  
"doc_count": 2  
},  
{  
"key_as_string" : "50",  
"key": 50,  
"doc_count": 4  
},  
{  
"key_as_string" : "150",  
"key": 150,  
"doc_count": 3  
}  
]  
}  
}  
}
Instead of :  
{  
"aggregations": {  
"prices" : {  
"buckets": [  
{  
"key": 0,  
"doc_count": 2  
},  
{  
"key": 50,  
"doc_count": 4  
},  
{  
"key": 150,  
"doc_count": 3  
}  
]  
}  
}  
}
You could say, it's not important but it generates json ~1/3 bigger...  
Is there a mean to disable this ???
Moreover, in Elasticsearch Java API, it could be fine to have a method to
request the response as a hash instead keyed by the buckets keys (cf
:http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-
aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html#_response_format)
Thanks!!!
