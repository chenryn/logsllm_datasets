Hello!
I thought I'd open an issue, as I am currently working on this and hope to
have a commit ready by the end of the day.
"kube-up" with AWS ought to build out a highly available and multi-AZ
kubernetes cluster following AWS EC2 best practices. There are two large steps
to this:
  1. Multi-AZ minions
  2. Highly available / Multi-AZ master
I am only focusing on goal #1 here. These changes center entirely in
cluster/aws/util.sh. However, I will need to modify the actual provider code
in Go because, while AWS ELBs are brought up with the proper subnets, it
appears they do not have multi-availability zone routing enabled.
I am leaving the security groups in place and creating a secondary subnet and
secondary autoscaling group. NUM_MINIONS is now split into
NUM_MINIONS_PRIMARY_ZONE and NUM_MINIONS_SECONDARY_ZONE. The default
AWS_REGION of "us-east-1" is supplemented by AWS_ZONE_PRIMARY of "a" and
AWS_ZONE_SECONDARY of "c" (us-east-1 has no "b"...)
I wanted to pop this issue to collect thoughts from AWS users. If anyone is
already doing multi-AZ kubernetes cluster, please let me know if you have run
into any edge cases! I will issue a PR for this very shortly.
Thanks!
