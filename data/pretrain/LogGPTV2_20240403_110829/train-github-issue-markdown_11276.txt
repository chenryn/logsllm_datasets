I am using the FFV1 codec proivded by FFMPEG to record videos with
`VideoWriter`. This defaults to using FFV1 version 3, however, I would like to
change the codec used to FFV1 version 1. In plain FFMPEG this can be done by
passing the `-level 1` flag to the call.
Is it possible to do something like this through OpenCV? So far, I have not
found anything useful regarding this.
I have asked the same question on the forum but have recieved no response.
Hence I am asking here as well.
