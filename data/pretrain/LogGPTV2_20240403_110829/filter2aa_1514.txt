Our perspectives on significant issues like torture and terrorism are deeply influenced by our personal experiences. It is nearly impossible to remain dispassionate when reflecting on such horrific events that cause cognitive dissonance or worse. To set the stage for this review, I will begin with a conversation over coffee in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.

I met Steven Miles, a soft-spoken physician from Minneapolis, MN, at a restaurant before the publication of his book. Miles is a Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School and a faculty member of the Center for Bioethics. His demeanor is quintessentially professorial, characterized by a pleasant smile and an easy manner. Yet, our conversation took on a conspiratorial tone, despite the fact that the 35,000 documents he consulted for his book were publicly available, thanks to the ACLU and FOIA. The documents themselves were not secret, but Miles had to uncover the connections between them, piecing together the movements of military physicians across various locations and events.

As Miles discussed his research, his restrained demeanor was punctuated by visible outrage and rage. He detailed how doctors had aided and abetted torture in Iraq, Guantanamo, and other undisclosed locations. The fact that our conversation about public documents in a public place felt so clandestine is a testament to the impact of delving into the world described in this book. We were not being paranoid; we were experiencing the profound effect of confronting the actions taken in the name of the war on terror and in the name of Americans in a secret world.

Researchers like Miles often experience "secondary trauma," as a therapist once told me, which made me aware of my own symptoms. Immersing oneself in such a world leads to predictable consequences. We become obsessed with the truth, an elusive goal under any circumstances, and our moral framework tends to become binary. In the face of traumatic events, whether experienced firsthand or secondhand, the distinction between good and evil becomes stark.

Whether it's a conversation in a restaurant or the experience of reading this book, these are the effects that can occur. Miles shared, "I am often asked if my life is in danger because of this research. Thatâ€™s an epiphenomenon of being a torturing society. A torturing society is one that is eroded by the process of dehumanization. In that process, we create our own mirrored netherworlds."

The distortion of our thinking, behavior, and moral compass, as our society justifies, rationalizes, and minimizes the impact of state-sanctioned torture, is inevitable. This is the deeper subtext of Miles' book, which documents and illuminates how some doctors have kept prisoners alive during torture and interrogation and have falsified death certificates to attribute natural causes instead of torture. *Oath Betrayed* shows how the Hippocratic Oath, sworn by doctors to do no harm, is perverted in the name of fighting terror.

This book is a plea for justice, reinforcing the reasons why America historically rejected torture as both ineffective and inhumane. Miles believes that a society that allows open discourse about such events will be positively affected as consciences are awakened and resolve strengthened. The existence of this book is an act of hope and affirmation.

Miles also acknowledges that discussing these issues does not expose him to the same risks faced by colleagues in other countries, who have been tortured or killed for speaking out. He recognizes that we still enjoy relative freedom of speech. However, for this freedom to be more than a safety valve, it must lead to action. In a society saturated with fictional and non-fictional accounts of violence and torture, we have become desensitized to the reality that Miles urges us to confront. Reading this book is not easy. Miles challenges us to explore the deeper moral, ethical, and psychological consequences of our policies and practices, to understand what it means to become a torturing society. Unlike screen violence, his aim is not to produce a vicarious thrill but to prompt a re-examination of the thinking that led to such practices.
