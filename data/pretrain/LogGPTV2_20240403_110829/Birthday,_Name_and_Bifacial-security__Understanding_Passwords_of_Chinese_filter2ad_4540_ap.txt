(i.e., L, LD and D) also account for slightly over 80%.
This indicates that, unlike English speaking users, Chi-
nese speaking users are inclined to employ digits to build
their passwords — digits in Chinese passwords serve
the role of letters that play in English passwords, while
letters in Chinese passwords mainly come from Pinyin
words/ names. This is probably due to that most Chinese
users are unfamiliar with English language (and Roman
letters on the keyboard). If this is the case, is there any
meaningful information in these digit sequences?
Semantics in passwords. As there is little existing
work,
to gain an insight into the underlying seman-
tic patterns, we have to construct semantic dictionaries
from scratch by ourselves. Finally, we construct 22
dictionaries of different semantic categories (see the ﬁrst
column in Table 5). The detailed information about
how we construct them is referred to Appendix B. To
eliminate ambiguities, we use the “left-most longest
match” when matching a password with each item in
our dictionaries. Table 5 shows the prevalence of various
semantic patterns in passwords. Lots of English speaking
users tend to use raw English words as their password
building blocks: 25.88% insert a 5+-letter word into their
passwords. Passwords with a 5+-letter word account
for over a third of the total passwords with a 5+-letter
substring. In comparison, fewer Chinese users (2.41%)
choose English words to build passwords, yet they prefer
Pinyin names (11.50%), especially full names.
It is somewhat surprising to see that the sum of merely
the top-3 digit-based patterns (i.e., D, LD, and DL)
Particularly, of all the Chinese passwords (22.42%)
include a 5+-letter substring, more than half
