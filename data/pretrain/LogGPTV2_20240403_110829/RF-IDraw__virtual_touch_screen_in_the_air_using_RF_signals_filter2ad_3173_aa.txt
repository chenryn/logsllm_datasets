ABSTRACT
Prior work in RF-based positioning has mainly focused on dis-
covering the absolute location of an RF source, where state-of-the-
art systems can achieve an accuracy on the order of tens of centime-
ters using a large number of antennas. However, many applications
in gaming and gesture based interface see more beneﬁts in know-
ing the detailed shape of a motion. Such trajectory tracing requires
a resolution several fold higher than what existing RF-based posi-
tioning systems can offer.
This paper shows that one can provide a dramatic increase in tra-
jectory tracing accuracy, even with a small number of antennas. The
key enabler for our design is a multi-resolution positioning tech-
nique that exploits an intrinsic tradeoff between improving the reso-
lution and resolving ambiguity in the location of the RF source. The
unique property of this design is its ability to precisely reconstruct
the minute details in the trajectory shape, even when the absolute
position might have an offset. We built a prototype of our design
with commercial off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags and used it to
enable a virtual touch screen, which allows a user to interact with a
desired computing device by gesturing or writing her commands in
the air, where each letter is only a few centimeters wide.

INTRODUCTION
RF-based positioning has become the next frontier for innova-
tion in mobile computing, business analytics, and human-computer
interaction [16, 29, 17]. The topic has attracted much interest from
both the industry [30, 14, 23, 3] and the research community, which
translated to many advanced RF-localization systems [41, 19, 39].
So far, however, the literature has mainly focused on the problem
of discovering the exact location of an RF source on a building
ﬂoor [41, 19, 13, 28]. Many applications, on the other hand, care
more about the detailed trajectory of a target as opposed to its exact
location; for example, in gesture-based user interfaces, it is more
important to be able to precisely track the shape of a gesture with
high resolution and ﬁdelity, while the actual position may still have
an offset. For such applications, existing schemes cannot reproduce
an accurate version of the trajectory shape to satisfy the applica-
tions’ needs.
This paper introduces RF-IDraw, a system that can accurately
trace the trajectory of an RF source, particularly an RFID. RF-
IDraw’s trajectory tracing is so accurate that it enables a virtual
touch screen based on RF signals. Today, a user can write, scroll,
or swipe on a touch screen of a smart phone or tablet. Taking this
a step further, RF-IDraw allows a user to input her commands by

writing, scrolling, swiping, etc., without being in physical touch
with a screen – the user can write in the air any word or command
using an RFID attached to a pen or a ﬁnger splint, as shown in
Fig. 1(a). RF-IDraw would reconstruct the RFID’s trajectory and
interpret the user’s writing and gestures as input to the desired com-
puting device. Essentially, RF-IDraw can transform any plane or
surface in space into a virtual touch screen. Fig. 1(b) shows an ex-
ample of RF-IDraw’s output which was entered by writing in the
air using an RFID on the user’s ﬁnger. Such a virtual touch screen
can be used to realize a variety of applications. For example, it can
be used to interact with a remote screen, to send commands to a cell
phone without touching it, or to interface with small devices (e.g.,
sensors) that do not have space for a keyboard.
RF-IDraw’s technology is based on the realization that a dif-
ferent design principle for leveraging multiple antennas can lead
to a signiﬁcant improvement in both tracing and localization ac-
curacy. Speciﬁcally, state-of-the-art RF-based positioning systems
typically use an antenna array, and leverage its beamsteering capa-
bility to detect the direction of the source [41, 39, 12, 21]. The loca-
tion of the source can then be computed by intersecting the beams
of multiple such arrays. Hence, to obtain a high accuracy, they need
an array with a narrow beam, which requires a large number of an-
tennas. For example, Fig. 2 compares the beam width of 2-antenna
and 4-antenna arrays; both have the default antenna spacing of λ

Figure 3—Tradeoff Between Improving Resolution and Removing Ambiguity: As
the separation of the antenna pair (marked in red) increases, the number of beams in-
creases accordingly, causing ambiguity in localizing the source (marked in blue). On
the other hand, each beam gets narrower, leading to a higher resolution.

where λ is the wavelength. Clearly, the more antennas on the array,
the narrower its beam and the higher the resolution it provides in
identifying the direction of the source. Thus, a standard approach
in RF positioning systems is to increase the number of antennas in
the array in order to achieve higher accuracy [41, 39].
In contrast, in designing RF-IDraw, we realize that for any num-
ber of antennas, there is always a tradeoff between resolution and
unambiguity. Speciﬁcally, let us ﬁx the number of antennas to be 2,
and consider the beam patterns of this pair of antennas when they
are separated by λ
2 , λ, and 8λ respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(a), (b)
and (c). As we can see, when the antenna separation is λ
2 , the array
has a single beam; yet the beam is wide and does not pinpoint the di-
rection of the source, i.e., low resolution. As the antenna separation
increases, the beam becomes narrower and more tightly bounds the
direction of the source. However, instead of a single beam, we start
to see multiple beams, despite the fact that there is a single direc-
tion along which the actual signal arrives, which causes ambiguity.
Thus, there is a tradeoff in antenna spacing, between localizing with
high resolution and localizing with no ambiguity.
Past work uses arrays with a maximum antenna spacing of
λ/2 [41, 39, 19], hence avoiding ambiguity, but also sacriﬁcing the
potential of higher resolution. In contrast, in RF-IDraw, we lever-
age our understanding of the structure of the ambiguity to increase
localization accuracy. In particular, RF-IDraw uses a few antenna
pairs with different separations. The pairs with larger separation
have very narrow beams and hence deﬁne the resolution of the po-
sitioning system. The pairs with small separation operate as ﬁlters
to eliminate the ambiguity introduced by the widely separated an-
tenna pairs, while maintaining the high resolution. Fig. 4 shows
the result after applying the wide beam in Fig. 3(a) as a ﬁlter on
Fig. 3(c). As we can see, most of the unintended beams have been
ﬁltered out and there is one distinctive narrow beam (whiter means
higher likelihood) that bounds the correct direction of the source.
Note that, both Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 4 are produced using a total of
4 antennas, yet the latter offers signiﬁcantly higher resolution (i.e.,
much narrower beam) than the standard 4-antenna array, and thus
demonstrates a more effective way of arranging the antennas.
A key characteristic of RF-IDraw’s design is its ability to trace
the detailed shape of an RF source’s trajectory, even when the actual
position has some offset. The tracing accuracy is due to the use of
the ﬁne beams in Fig. 3(c). Recall that tracking with an antenna
array means that the beam of the array rotates to follow the source
direction. When we have multiple beams as in Fig. 3(c), the correct
beam rotates to track the source, but the wrong beams also rotate
with it. Thus, even if one mistook the correct beam, the shape of
the trajectory would continue to match the performed gesture, as
further explained in §4.
We have built a prototype of RF-IDraw using commercial RFID
readers and used it to track off-the-shelf UHF RFIDs. Further, we
integrated RF-IDraw with the handwriting recognition functionality
in the MyScript Stylus [36] Android app to evaluate RF-IDraw’s
function as a virtual touch screen. We run our experiments with ﬁve
users in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight, 2–5 meters away
from the reader antennas.1 Our experiments lead to the following
ﬁndings:
• RF-IDraw can track the detailed trajectory shape of the users’
writing with a median accuracy of 3.7 cm, 11× more accurate
than the state-of-the-art antenna array based technique using the
same number of antennas. Note that, this accuracy number does
not fully capture the power of RF-IDraw’s trajectory tracing. In
particular, even with a median 3.7 cm error on points along the
trajectory, the shape of the overall trajectory is still preserved,
because this error only reﬂects the coherent stretching or squeez-
ing of the trajectory. Therefore, the handwritten characters re-
constructed by RF-IDraw are correctly recognized by MyScript
Stylus in 97.5% of the cases, and the words reconstructed by RF-
IDraw are correctly recognized in 92% of the cases. In contrast,
for the trajectories reproduced by the antenna array based tech-
nique using the same number of antennas as RF-IDraw, the char-
acter recognition success rate is less than 4%, which is equivalent
to a random guess, and the word recognition success rate is 0%.
• RF-IDraw’s trajectory tracing accuracy holds in non-line-of-
sight scenarios, where the median accuracy is 4.9 cm, and the
character recognition success rate is 96.8%.
• Even when identifying the exact location, as opposed to tracing,
RF-IDraw’s accuracy is 2.2× higher than the baseline that uses
antenna arrays with the same number of antennas as RF-IDraw.
To our knowledge, RF-IDraw is the ﬁrst RF-based system that
can transform any plane or surface into a virtual touch screen,
which opens up an entirely new range of applications in user in-
teraction interfaces.
2. RELATED WORK
Prior work on RF-based positioning has primarily relied on RSSI
(Received Signal Strength) [13, 28] or AoA (Angle of Arrival) in-
formation [41, 19, 22]. State-of-the-art systems use antenna arrays
or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to extract AoA of an RF signal
and can achieve a positioning accuracy on the order of tens of cen-
timeters [41, 19]. Using a dense, surveyed grid of reference sources,
1Unlike WiFi based localization work that aims to locate users on
an ofﬁce ﬂoor (e.g., [41]), RF-IDraw operates at a shorter range
since it is based on RFID. §9.3 discusses the prospect of applying
RF-IDraw’s techniques to WiFi systems.
236several schemes can achieve a higher accuracy of a few centime-
ters by identifying the nearest references [39, 37]. For example, the
work in [37] leverages the motion of a robot equipped with refer-
ence RFIDs to enable centimeter-scale accuracy in grasping an ob-
ject tagged with RFIDs. RF-IDraw differs from these past schemes
in both techniques and capabilities. By effectively exploiting the
high resolution of antenna pairs with large separations, RF-IDraw
offers unmatched accuracy in tracking an RF device’s detailed tra-
jectory without the use of references. As such, it enables a whole
new class of applications which are previously infeasible using RF
signals, such as virtual touch screen in the air.
The conception and design of RF-IDraw are inspired by astro-
nomical interferometry, where telescopes are used to image the
sky and search for planets [20, 34, 2]. In particular, in astron-
omy, pairs of telescopes with large separation are used to produce
high-resolution fringes. One can consider these telescopes as an-
tennas. The narrow beams produced by RF-IDraw’s antenna pairs
with large separation and the fringes in interferometry are similar
in nature, i.e., both offer high resolution at the cost of ambiguity.
Ambiguity in interferometry is resolved using delay lines which
effectively orient each telescope pair towards a particular part of
the sky, whereas in RF-IDraw, we use a pair of antennas with small
separation to focus on a particular region in the area of interest. Fur-
thermore, in astronomy, the rotation of the Earth/sky is exploited to
facilitate better coverage and accuracy. In RF-IDraw, although we
do not have a known motion like the rotation of the Earth to lever-
age, we integrate information gathered throughout the trajectory of
the RF device to improve the elimination of ambiguity, which has
a similar ﬂavor. However, while the underlying intuition is trans-
ferable between the two, RF-IDraw’s algorithms, signal processing
techniques, and applications signiﬁcantly differ from astronomical
interferometry.
In the context of RF antenna arrays, recently there is a growing
interest in exploring the use of sparse arrays to estimate the angle
of arrival [31, 25, 18]. For example, [31, 25] propose the use of co-
prime sampling in a large uniform linear array to reduce the number
of antennas needed; [18] evaluates the use of compressive sensing
in sampling the antenna positions. By virtue of emulating very large
arrays, these schemes show asymptotic improvement over the naive
AoA approach through theoretical analyses. However, for a small
number of antennas available to our application of interest (i.e., 8 in
total), the asymptotic analysis does not lead to any meaningful gain,
and hence these proposals cannot achieve the resolution enabled by
RF-IDraw. Furthermore, they focus on estimating a single measure-
ment of angle of arrival, as opposed to tracing the trajectory shape
as RF-IDraw does.
Systems such as [7] and [32] make use of depth sensors (e.g.,
Kinect) and infrared cameras (e.g., Wii) to turn a projector screen
or wall into a touch screen and allow a user to interact with the
display using a specially designed pen. RF-IDraw is the ﬁrst RF-
based virtual touch screen; unlike solutions based on depth imaging
or infrared, it does not require line-of-sight to work. Further, since
RF sources have unique IDs (e.g., RFID EPC ID [15]), it is easy to
scale to a larger number of users simultaneously interacting through
the virtual touch screen without causing confusion.
Finally, RF-IDraw’s application is inspired by recent work on
motion tracking [27, 10, 9] which uses RF signals to enable a user
to interact with the environment. Differing from these systems, RF-
IDraw is the ﬁrst RF-based solution that can accurately reconstruct
the detailed trajectory of a user’s writing or gesturing in the air,
where each letter or gesture is only a few centimeters wide. Such ca-
pability is not supported by prior work in RF-based gesture recog-
nition. For example, [27] presents a state-of-the-art WiFi-based in-

terface, yet it only supports the detection and classiﬁcation of a pre-
deﬁned set of nine gestures. Further, past work on RF-based gesture
recognition requires modiﬁed hardware [27, 10, 9]. In contrast, RF-
IDraw is a software patch that can be added to today’s standard
RFID readers, and does not require any hardware modiﬁcation.
3. MULTI-RESOLUTION POSITIONING
3.1 Primer
In RF-based positioning, the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of an RF
source is computed by comparing the phases of the received sig-
nals at multiple antennas [24]. Underlying the AoA computation is
the widely known principle that the phase of an RF signal rotates
by 2π for every λ distance the signal travels [35], where λ is the
wavelength. Speciﬁcally, let us consider a signal source at position
S, and a pair of receive antennas i and j separated by D in Fig. 5.
dS,i and dS,j denote the distances from S to the two antennas respec-
tively, and φi and φj are the phases of the received signal that we
measure at the two antennas. φi, φj ∈ [0, 2π). The distances and
the received signal phases have the following known relations due
to the phase rotation [35]:
φi = −mod(
φj = −mod(

Hence, the phase difference between the received signals at the two
antennas, ∆φj,i = φj −φi, relates to the difference in their distances
from the source, ∆di,j = dS,i − dS,j, as follows:
