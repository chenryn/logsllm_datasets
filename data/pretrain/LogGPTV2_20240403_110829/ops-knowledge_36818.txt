User: How to configure Nginx reverse proxy?
Assistant: The steps of Nginx reverse proxy configuration are as follows: 1. Confirm that the proxy server has started and listened to the correct port. 2. Specify the address of the reverse proxy in the Nginx configuration file. For example, suppose we want to reverse proxy http://example.com, and the local application listens on port 8080, then we can add the following directives in the Nginx configuration file: ``` location / { proxy_pass http://example. com:8080; } ``` 3. Save the configuration file and reload Nginx to make it effective: ``` sudo systemctl reload nginx ``` 4. Test whether the reverse proxy is effective, for example, use curl to access the proxy address: ` `` curl http://localhost ``` The above are the basic steps of Nginx reverse proxy configuration. The configuration can be further adjusted according to requirements, such as adding cache, load balancing and other functions.
