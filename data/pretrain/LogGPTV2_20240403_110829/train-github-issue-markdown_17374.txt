The .svg profile as generated by pprof's `web` command includes some
Javascript from https://www.cyberz.org/projects/SVGPan/SVGPan.js
the file is linked here:

I found it surprising to find pprof's SVG has external dependencies. Not just
because of tracking reasons (I don't think cyberz.org need to know about my
pprof usage), but also because it doesn't always work (e.g. working on a
train).
Would it be possible to just include the javascript code verbatim in the .SVG,
or otherwise to not include the external link by default?
