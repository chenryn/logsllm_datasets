User: I can run my python scripts on the terminal and get the print results on the stdout e.g. 
python myprog.py 
or simply redirect it to a file:
python myprog.py > out.txt
My question is how could I do both solutions at the same time.
My linux experience will tell me something like:
python myprog.py |& tee out.txt 
This is not having the behaviour I expected, print on the fly and not all at once when the program ends.
So what I wanted (preferred without changing python code) is the same behavior as python myprog.py (print on the fly) but also redirecting output to a file.
What is the simplest way to accomplish this?
Assistant: You want to use 'tee'. stdbuf -oL python mycode.py | tee out.txt
