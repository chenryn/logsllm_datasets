User: There is an existing web application that requires performance optimization. Please provide a performance optimization solution.
Assistant: 1. Cache optimization: Use caching technology to reduce the number of database and network requests and reduce the burden on the server. Consider using an in-memory database such as Redis. 2. Database optimization: optimize database query statements, use indexes to avoid full table scans; sub-table, sub-database and other technologies to improve query efficiency; regularly clean up useless data. 3. Code optimization: use more efficient algorithms and data structures; avoid using multi-layer loop nesting; avoid repeated calculations and repeated queries; reduce object creation and destruction. 4. Static resource optimization: Compress CSS, JS, pictures and other static resource files; use CDN to speed up static resource access. 5. Server optimization: Use a web server with better performance such as Nginx; use a load balancer to improve concurrent processing capabilities; optimize server system configuration, such as adjusting kernel parameters and improving disk IO performance. 6. Flow control optimization: limit the number of concurrent connections, request rate, etc., to prevent server crashes caused by too many requests. 7. Application structure optimization: splitting applications according to functional modules and using architectures such as microservices will help improve the scalability and performance of the system.
