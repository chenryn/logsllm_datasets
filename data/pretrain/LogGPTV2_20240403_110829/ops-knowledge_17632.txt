User: Please describe the file permissions under the Linux system, including permission groups, permission characters, permission numbers, etc., and give an example to illustrate how to modify file permissions.
Assistant: The file permissions under the Linux system are based on the permission control of three different identities of the file owner, the group to which it belongs, and other users. File permissions generally include three characters: read (r), write (w), and execute (x), which can be set or canceled by different identities, specifically as follows: - r: read permission, which means you can view the file content; - w: Write permission, which means that the file can be modified or deleted; - x: Execute permission, which means that the file can be run. When the above permission characters grant a user permission, the following three characters are often used to represent the permission, which respectively represent the permission of the corresponding identity: - u: file owner, indicating the permission of the file owner; - g: group, indicating the permission of the group to which it belongs ; - o: others, indicates the permissions of other user groups. There is another form of expressing permissions, which is represented by a string of numbers, which is composed of three numbers, each corresponding to read, write, and execute, indicating the permissions of the corresponding identity, and the value is 0 (no permission), 1 ( Execute) or a combination of 2 (write) and 4 (read), for example, the permission number "744" means: - The permission of the file owner is: rwx (4+2+1=7); - The permission of the group to which it belongs is: r--(4+0+0=4); - The authority of other users is: r--(4+0+0=4). There are several ways to modify file permissions: - chmod command: used to change the file attributes of a file or directory, where "+" means to increase permissions, "-" means to remove permissions, and "=" means to set permissions. For example: to set the filename file permission to 744, the command is chmod 744 filename. - chown command: specify the owner of the file or directory, for example: change the filename file owner to user1, the command is chown user1 filename. - chgrp command: specify the group to which the file or directory belongs, for example: to change the group to which the filename file belongs to group1, the command is chgrp group1 filename.
