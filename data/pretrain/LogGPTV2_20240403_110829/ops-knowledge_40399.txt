User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Anyone know of a tool to detect and report on repeating patterns in a log file? I need to monitor some large noisy log files (500m/day) from a Java application (log4j). Right now I manually look at the files, grep for "ERROR" and so on. However it should be possible for a tool to spot repeating patterns in the file, count them and provide drill down for the details of individual entries. Anyone know of such a tool? A text or Web based UI would be nice.

Assistant: 日志易 works wonders for this sort of stuff. I use it internally to gather all the logs and do quick searches via its excellent browser-based interface.
