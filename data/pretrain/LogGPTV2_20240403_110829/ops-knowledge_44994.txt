Question: "A security analyst is reviewing the code of a web application that uses SHA256 for password hashing. The analyst is asked to present arguments for and against the continuation of this practice. What are the reasons that support changing to a different password hashing strategy? (Select all that apply)"
 "A": "SHA256 is not collision-resistant, hence there is a risk that two different passwords might produce the same hash."
 "B": "SHA256 is designed to be fast, which could allow an attacker to test billions of password guesses rapidly in an offline password guessing attack."
 "C": "The use of SHA256 hashes allows for amortized guessing attacks, where the same guesses can be reused across multiple users, speeding up the attack process."
 "D": "SHA256 lacks a built-in salting mechanism, which means it is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks unless additional measures are implemented."
