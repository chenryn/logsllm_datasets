I was using an IPython notebook (with packages from either Anaconda 2.1.0 or Canopy 1.4.1) on a "Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise" system, and everything was working perfectly with the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox as my browser.

However, after another user started an IPython notebook in their account, both our notebooks began to experience issues. Initially, the other user's IPython notebook failed to run any notebooks. Subsequently, my IPython notebook also failed to open or create any new notebooks, even after restarting the kernel. The system displayed a "Problem signature" dialog with the following details:

- **Problem Event Name:** APPCRASH
- **Application Name:** python.exe
- **Application Version:** 0.0.0.0
- **Application Timestamp:** 538f8ffc
- **Fault Module Name:** oleshell874.dll
- **Fault Module Version:** 8.7.4.0
- **Fault Module Timestamp:** 54448aac
- **Exception Code:** c0000005
- **Exception Offset:** 0000000000004867
- **OS Version:** 6.1.7600.2.0.0.274.10
- **Locale ID:** 1033
- **Additional Information 1:** a481
- **Additional Information 2:** a481c64a34722f1c689be57b64ee6a54
- **Additional Information 3:** 3393
- **Additional Information 4:** 33936ce55b0e8b96f5dce6a43fae2e99

Reinstalling Anaconda or Canopy and restarting the system did not resolve the issue. I attempted to search for information about the fault module (oleshell874.dll) but found no relevant results.

After further investigation, I discovered that the file "oleshell874.dll" is not related to IPython or Windows. Renaming this file resolved the issue, and IPython now works again.

Thank you for your assistance!
