User: I was using ipython notebook (packages in Anaconda-2.1.0 or Canopy-1.4.1) in "Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise" with browser (latest version of chrome or firefox). It was working perfectly.
Once another user has started ipython notebook in his account. At first, his ipython notebook was failed to run any notebook. The worst is that my ipython was also failed to open or create any notebook after restart the kernel. The windows popup a dialog of "Problem signature" with following information:

Even I reinstalled the Anaconda or Canopy and restarted the system, it won't help. I have tried to google the Fault Module (oleshell874.dll) but it shows no result.
Please help!
Assistant: Thanks for your comment. I just tried to google "oleshell dll" and found this file is not related to ipython and windows. The ipython works again after I've renamed this file.
