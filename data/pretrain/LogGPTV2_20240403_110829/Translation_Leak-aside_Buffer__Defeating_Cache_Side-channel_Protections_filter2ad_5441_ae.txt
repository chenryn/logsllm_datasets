ing scenarios. Nonetheless, our approach is generic and
hence applicable to other attack settings, where an at-
tacker targets either ﬁne-grained (e.g., cache) or even
more coarse-grained (e.g., DRAM) channels.
12 Conclusion
TLBleed, a powerful and fundamentally new side chan-
nel attack via the TLB, shows that the problem of mi-
croarchitectural side channels goes much deeper than
previously assumed. So far, much of the community
has implicitly assumed that practical, ﬁne-grained side-
channel attacks are limited to the CPU data and instruc-
tion caches, leaving most other shared resources out of
the threat model.
In this paper, we have shown that
TLB activity monitoring not only offers a practical new
side channel, but also that it bypasses all the state-of-
the-art cache side-channel defenses. Since the operation
of the TLB is a fundamental hardware property, mit-
igating TLBleed is challenging.
It requires novel re-
search to design efﬁcient yet ﬂexible mechanisms that
isolate TLB partitions based on the corresponding se-
curity domains. However, it is not unlikely that as new
mitigations are developed, new side channels amenable
to practical attacks emerge. As a more general lesson,
TLBleed demonstrates that comprehensive side-channel
protection should carefully consider all shared resources.
