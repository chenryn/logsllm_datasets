the set size increases, the non-linear compute starts to become a
bottleneck and it loses to Protocol C. Note that Protocol C enjoys
much more light-weight compute and linear communication com-
plexity. Since Protocol B communicates more, it is inefficient when
compared to the other two protocols in the WAN setting.
6.2.1 Cost Estimation of HE-based mPSI. [44] gave mPSI schemes
based on threshold additively homomorphic encryption (AHE)
schemes and we estimate the cost of their most efficient variant
that uses hashing to significantly reduce the computation cost. The
protocol has four main steps: 1) distributed key generation phase
for an AHE scheme; 2) encryption phase where each client (parties
𝑃2, · · · , 𝑃𝑛) generates 𝐵𝜁 ciphertexts (using the AHE encryption)
and sends them to the leader 𝑃1, where 𝐵 = 𝑚/log 𝑚 is the number
of bins after hashing, and each bin has 𝜁 = 𝑚/𝐵+(cid:112)𝑚 log 𝐵/𝐵 values;
3) homomorphic evaluation phase where the leader 𝑃1 performs
𝐵𝜁𝑛+𝜁𝑚 homomorphic additions and 𝑚𝜁 homomorphic scalar mul-
tiplications (for plaintext size of 32 bits); 4) threshold decryption
phase where parties together do a decryption of 𝑚 ciphertexts. As
the end-to-end protocol would require concretely efficient proto-
cols for distributed key generation (Step 1), we focus only on AHE
schemes for which such concretely efficient protocols are known
(and hence do not consider lattice based AHE schemes [8, 33, 34]).
In particular, as suggested by [44], we use El Gamal and Paillier
based AHE schemes and estimate the cost of Steps 2 and 3 that is
clearly a strict lower bound for the overall cost.
As suggested by [44] we use the costs of microbenchmarking
provided in [29] for both El Gamal and Paillier encryption schemes.
For 𝑚 = 220 and 𝑛 = 15, this gives us a computation cost lower
bound of 729s for the El Gamal instantiation, and 7973s for the
Paillier instantiation in a similar setting as ours. In contrast, our
end-to-end protocol takes only ≈ 40s and hence, is at least 18× and
200× faster than El Gamal and Paillier based schemes, respectively.
Communication estimate for these steps is similar to ours in case of
El Gamal and is much higher for the Paillier based scheme. Similarly,
for 𝑚 = 212 and 𝑛 = 5, these two steps take at least 4s with El Gamal
and 35s with Paillier, and communication of both schemes is much
worse than our scheme. In comparison, our protocol executes in
0.23s and is 17× and 150× faster than the El Gamal and Paillier
based schemes, respectively.
6.3 Performance of Circuit PSI and qPSI
Circuit PSI. As discussed in Section 4, in steps 5,6 (Figure 6), we
need to work over a prime field F𝑝 such that 𝑝 > 𝑛. Hence, the
Mersenne prime 25 − 1 suffices for up to 30 parties and also for all
the settings we consider. However, the smallest prime 𝑝 for which
the implementation of protocols for multiparty functionalities from
Section 2.5 is available (at [20]) is for the Mersenne prime 231 − 1,
which is an overkill for our implementations. Based on the concrete
communication analysis discussed in Section 4.2, we observe that
the communication in steps 5,6 using Mersenne prime 31 is < 8.2%
of the communication involved in steps 1 – 4 of the protocol for the
values of 𝑛, 𝑡 and 𝑚 considered in our experiments. Moreover, the
computation done in these steps are arithmetic operations over the
small field F31. Hence, performance of the steps 1–4 of the protocol
is a strong indicator of its overall performance.
We illustrate the performance of steps 1–4 in Table 5 when wPSM
is instantiated using relaxed-batch OPPRF [13]. These numbers can
be extrapolated to estimate the overall run-time of the protocol. For
instance, we estimate our Circuit PSI protocol to take 12.19𝑠 and
80.09𝑠 in LAN and WAN setting respectively for 10 parties with
𝑡 = 4 and input set size 218.
qPSI. Protocol Quorum-I convincingly outperforms Quorum-II for
the values of 𝑛, 𝑡 and 𝑚 that we consider in our experiments (see
Theorem 5.1). The aforementioned discussion in the context of
Circuit PSI protocol also holds for protocol Quorum-I. From the
concrete communication analysis in Appendix F.2, for the values of
𝑛, 𝑡, 𝑚 considered in experiments, the communication in step 5 (see
Figure 16) using Mersenne prime 31 is < 21% of the communication
involved in steps 1 – 4 for all values of 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛−1. Hence, for instance,
the run-time of Quorum-I protocol can be estimated to be 5.49𝑠 and
37.85𝑠 in LAN and WAN setting respectively for 15 parties with
𝑡 = 7, 𝑚 = 216 and any 𝑘 ≤ 14.
