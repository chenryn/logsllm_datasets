User: I seem to be in a never ending tail spin of Linux, or not, Windows or not. Web programming or system programming. Python or PHP.
I'am self teaching myself programming. But it seems I keep being torn about which way to go. Unfortunately it is always seemingly good reasons to get side tracked. You know the whole open source or proprietary thing. Lately I have decided after a year that Linux just doesn't cut it for me and it mostly stems from me wanting to watch videos on Channel 9 etc, and the clunkiness that is Linux. So that lead me to, "Should I learn ASP.NET, since I am more so deciding Windows IS a "necessary" evil.
I hope this made sense. The reason I settled in on Web Development as my course to learning programming is because I actually have a task to implement rather then aimlessly reading reference books etc.
Does anyone have any advice at what they may have done to stay focused and not get lead down every tangent or idea.
Assistant: I had the same issue for a little while myself. I was getting bored of just being in PHP and wanted to be able to do more. I ended up settling on C# since it not only fulfilled the 'necessary evil' argument, but allows me to do anything I want in the MS realm, and is the closest syntax wise to another language (Java).
Thinking about all the different types of projects this opened me up to made me choose this direction. Both languages can be used for web development, mobile devices, and desktop applications.
