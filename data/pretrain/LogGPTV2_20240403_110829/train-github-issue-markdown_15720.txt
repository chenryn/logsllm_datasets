  * **Install tools** :
  * **Others** :  
I used my laptop as the master and node, and used a virtualbox machine
installed the same OS as a the other node.
**What happened** :  
I set the same host name(--hostname-override=k8s-node1-192.168.0.105) in
kubelet startup argument on both of two nodes by mistake. Both of them
successfully registered on the master. if create a rc with replicas equal 2,
you will see both of nodes have duplicate ones. There are two pods on each
node and the pods identical. By the way if run "kubectl get no", it will show
only one node.
**What you expected to happen** :  
I think if there is a host name conflict, kubelet should fail to registered.
It means new node cannot be added in cluster.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
  1. set same host name using hostname-override to start kubelet on two nodes.
  2. create a rc and schedule to those two nodes.
  3. run "docker ps" on those two nodes to check result.
