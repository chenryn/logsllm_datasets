**Alex Antonov** opened **SPR-2674** and commented
If a redirectToView is used after the request has been binded and validated,
both BeanPropertyBindingResult and DirectFieldBindingResult do not carry over
the underlying BeanWrapper and DirectFieldAccessor (due to them being
transient and thus not being serialized in the implementations of the HTTP
session which uses byte-array serialization mechanism), and as a result,
loosing all the custom PropertyEditors which were assigned to the
BindingResult during.
Not sure what the exact reason for declaring the
BeanWrapper/DirectFieldAccessor transient is, but the most obvious fix is to
make them non-transient, or explicitly hold a reference to the
PropertyEditorRegistry in the *BindingResult implementations and then inject
it into the newly recreated instances of BeanWrapper/DirectFieldAccessor.

  * #7258 Serializable Bind exception bean wrapper is transient, therefore installed property editors are lost upon deserialization. ( _ **"duplicates"**_ )
