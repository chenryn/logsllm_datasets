Question: "An organization's security audit of their operational technology (OT) systems revealed several critical security weaknesses. In the audit report, it was mentioned that the systems lacked proper authentication mechanisms, and some even used client-side authentication for critical functionality. What are the potential risks of these findings and what could be the consequences if these vulnerabilities are exploited?"
 "A": "Attackers could manipulate the OT systems to cause disruptions, leading to safety hazards in industries such as power and water."
 "B": "The lack of proper authentication might expose the system to malware infections, causing data breaches and loss of intellectual property."
 "C": "Unauthorized users could gain administrative access, potentially allowing them to send out fake alerts or messages."
 "D": "There is a risk of performance degradation due to the additional overhead of implementing stronger authentication measures."
