User: How to use Git for version control and push code to GitHub repository?
Assistant: Here are the basic steps: 1. Install Git Install Git on your local computer. Depending on your operating system (Windows, MacOS or Linux), you can find the corresponding installation package on the Git website. 2. Create a local warehouse Create a new folder on the local computer for the project, then use the command line (terminal) to enter the folder and initialize the Git warehouse. ``` cd /path/to/new/folder git init ``` 3. Add files For the first file of the project, add it to the git repository. ``` git add file1.txt ``` 4. Commit changes Commit the file you just added and any changes. ``` git commit -m "Add file1.txt" ``` 5. Create a remote warehouse Create a new remote warehouse on GitHub and copy the URL of the warehouse. 6. Link the local warehouse and the remote warehouse Link the local warehouse to the remote warehouse and set an alias ("origin" is the alias recommended by git). ``` git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git ``` 7. Push the code to the remote warehouse Push the changes of the local warehouse to the remote warehouse. ``` git push -u origin master ``` This will push all changes to the master branch named "master", which is usually recommended for management and gain access to new repository commits. Any changes and commits made afterward can be made using the same command, just replacing the filename and commit message with the new content.
