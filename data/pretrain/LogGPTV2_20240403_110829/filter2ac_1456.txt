**ATT&CK ID:** S0352  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D

**Description:**
OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D has multiple variants that perform checks on various system parameters to determine whether the malware is running on actual hardware or within a virtual machine (VM) environment. One of the methods used by these variants involves querying the `sysctl` command with the `hw.model` parameter. This check helps the malware evade detection and analysis in VM environments, where it might be more likely to be scrutinized by security researchers.
