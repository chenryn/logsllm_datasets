The comments for issue #4518 contain numerous suggestions, but there is no clear resolution provided. Here are the details of my environment and the error I'm encountering:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **CUDA:** Not installed
- **Python Version:**
  ```
  Python 3.6.5 (v3.6.5:f59c0932b4, Mar 28 2018, 17:00:18) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
  ```

When I try to import the `torch` library, I receive the following error:

```python
import torch
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\Users\dae\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\torch\__init__.py", line 78, in <module>
    from torch._C import *
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
```

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?
