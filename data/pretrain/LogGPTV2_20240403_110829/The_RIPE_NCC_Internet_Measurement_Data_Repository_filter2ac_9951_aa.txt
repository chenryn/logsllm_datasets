## Abstract
This paper describes datasets that will soon be made available to the research community through an Internet measurement data repository operated by the RIPE NCC. The datasets include measurements collected by RIPE NCC projects, packet trace sets recovered from the defunct NLANR website, and datasets collected and currently hosted by other research institutions. This work aims to raise awareness of these datasets among researchers and to promote discussion about possible changes to the data collection processes to ensure that the measurements are relevant and useful to the community.

## 1. Introduction
A core requirement of any Internet measurement project is to acquire appropriate measurement data. However, privacy and security concerns often prevent researchers from collecting the data themselves. Therefore, it is crucial that organizations capable of collecting useful measurement data share it with the research community. This allows researchers to focus on analyzing existing data rather than conducting new measurements, promoting collaboration and enabling validation studies.

One common challenge in sharing Internet measurement data is raising awareness of available datasets within the research community. Currently, publicly available data is scattered across various hosting locations, making it difficult for researchers to locate suitable datasets and stay informed about new releases. While resources like DatCat [1] have helped, they are not yet comprehensive.

The maintenance of repositories hosted by research groups, which often depend on competitive grants, is also a significant concern. For example, the recent disappearance of the NLANR website, which hosted many passive trace sets, including the popular Auckland and Abilene traces, highlights this issue. Fortunately, the University of Waikato, with support from CAIDA, salvaged the contents of the site before it became inaccessible. However, without such intervention, the data could have been lost permanently.

As a Regional Internet Registry (RIR), the RIPE Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) has the capability to collect a large quantity of measurement data that would be extremely difficult for academic researchers to acquire independently. Some of the RIPE NCC data is already publicly available, but each project shares data independently in various ways. Therefore, the RIPE NCC is developing a common and consistent platform for hosting and sharing Internet measurement data. The primary goal is to streamline access to RIPE NCC datasets, but the repository will also be open to other collectors who wish to share their data with the research community. By grouping datasets into a single repository, finding and accessing appropriate measurement data will be easier, and awareness of available datasets will increase. One advantage of the RIPE NCC operating a measurement data repository is that its continued existence does not depend solely on research grants, reducing the likelihood of the repository disappearing.

Anonymization is a significant issue when sharing Internet measurement data. Datasets published for the first time will need to be anonymized, and agreements with users must be developed to prevent inappropriate disclosure of personal and commercial information. Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, as each dataset may contain different types of sensitive information.

Similarly, the structure and scope of a system for providing useful metadata and annotation of the shared datasets are yet to be fully determined. We expect that entries for datasets shared through the RIPE repository will be added to existing sites such as DatCat [1] and WITS [2], as well as a site developed and hosted as part of the RIPE repository itself. We hope to elicit ideas and thoughts from the wider research community regarding the information that should be provided through such a system and the best format for presenting it. The RIPE NCC also plans to identify all users of the repository and maintain contact with them during their research. This is intended to encourage researchers to engage with data collectors about how measurements can be improved to be more useful and relevant.

The remainder of this paper describes the datasets currently under consideration for sharing through the RIPE repository. For each dataset, a brief overview of the dataset, its associated research project, and the measurement techniques employed is presented.

## 2. RIPE Datasets

### 2.1 K-root
The K-root service is an Internet root name service operated by the RIPE NCC [3]. It consists of seventeen nodes located both inside and outside Europe. Six of the nodes are global instances announced with an anycast 23-bit prefix, while the remaining eleven nodes are local instances announced with a 24-bit prefix using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) no-export community tag [4]. Each node operates three distinct data collection systems.

- **tcpdump:** Used to capture passive traces of incoming traffic on port 53 (DNS queries). Trace files are rotated hourly and retained on disk for five days. Each node generates between 300 and 500 megabytes of compressed traces per hour, resulting in approximately 300 gigabytes of data daily.
- **DNS Statistics Collector (DSC):** Captures DNS traffic and summarizes it into one-minute bins. This data is used to generate graphs on the K-root website. The raw DSC output is transferred to the RIPE NCC and archived indefinitely, extending back to the beginning of 2008. The amount of data collected is estimated to be approximately 1 megabyte per day.
- **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):** Statistics are collected from the last-hop router serving each K-root node. The SNMP queries originate from the RIPE NCC in Amsterdam. If connectivity to a queried router is lost, data collection stops, and the dataset becomes non-contiguous. The statistics are summarized and exported into a round-robin database (RRD) configured to retain the SNMP data for a year.

### 2.2 Reverse DNS
The RIPE NCC hosts reverse DNS (rDNS) services for its delegated address space. Four servers provide rDNS and other associated services, processing approximately 50,000 queries per second, more than triple the load of the K-root server. Due to the high query rate, regular passive traces are not feasible. Occasional tcpdump traces are collected for specific needs, such as during attacks, but these are short and irregular. If there is sufficient need, it may be possible to collect a sample or summary of the traffic using a dedicated collector on a mirrored switch port.

DSC is used on each rDNS server, and the raw data is kept indefinitely. Currently, this data and the DSC graphs are only available internally at the RIPE NCC but could be made available to researchers if there is a need.

### 2.3 AS112
The RIPE NCC hosts an Autonomous System (AS) number 112 reverse DNS and dynamic DNS update server for the RFC 1918 private address space [12]. The server processes about 2,000 transactions per second. Since anyone can announce the AS112 prefix, there is no definitive list of AS112 servers. More than 50 servers are listed, but there are likely others.

A passive tcpdump trace is collected annually from the RIPE NCC AS112 server and contributed to the "Day in the Life of the Internet" (DITL) project [6]. More frequent captures could be scheduled if required. Additionally, DSC data is collected and used to generate graphs available from the RIPE NCC AS112 website [13].

### 2.4 RIS
The Routing Information Service (RIS) is a set of 16 route collectors running quagga [14] that peer with approximately 600 BGP routers. Most collectors are located within the RIPE region, but some are in the United States and South America. The routes learned are not used for routing traffic but are collected and published to provide a resource for understanding Internet routing and diagnosing routing problems. Around 100 peers provide a complete routing table, while others provide partial tables. The BGP sessions include both IPv4 and IPv6.

Collectors export route updates every five minutes and perform a full table dump every eight hours. At any given time, not all peers are actively peered with a collector due to configuration changes, equipment failure, network failure, and human error. There are also gaps in the dataset due to system failures. An automated system detects results much smaller than expected and informs an administrator to investigate the fault. Some Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routes are leaked to RIS, resulting in some single-bit prefixes being advertised in the data.

Data collected from RIS is stored in the Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit (MRT) format [15]. All data since 2000 is retained indefinitely. A month of data is approximately 22 gigabytes compressed, and the entire dataset is close to one terabyte. The last three months of data are exported to a MySQL database, also one terabyte in size. Quagga logs and a selection of metadata are supplied with the RIS data. The logs show when peers start or end a BGP session and when timers expire, for example.

The raw data is currently publicly available through the RIS website, accessed by around 1,000 distinct hosts each month, including BGPmon [16] and Cyclops [17] websites, which use the data to offer route announcement and bogon notification services. The RIPE NCC also publishes weekly statistical reports, provides tools for querying and visualizing RIS data, and enables Looking Glass queries to be sent directly to the collectors. Users can subscribe to a notification service for interesting events, such as changes in the advertisement for a particular AS.

### 2.5 Hostcount
The Hostcount project [18] generates statistics from a monthly DNS scan of approximately 100 top-level domains (TLDs) within the RIPE region. The scan is performed by conducting a zone transfer on the DNS tree rooted at each TLD. During the walk, counts of A and PTR records are maintained for both forward and reverse IPv4 addresses, as well as forward AAAA (but not reverse) IPv6 addresses.

Since most DNS administrators disable public zone transfers, the scan is not exhaustive. Some administrators permit the RIPE scan, but often under the condition that only statistics, rather than raw data, are published. The blocking of zone transfers has increased over time, so earlier data better reflects the total number of hosts at that time.

Currently, statistics are published via the Hostcount website [18], including the number of distinct hosts found at different levels of the DNS tree for each TLD, the number of zones discovered, and the number of successful zone transfers. Raw data from 1990 to 2007 has been archived and is in offline storage. The current policy is to discard raw data after extracting statistics, but this could be reversed if there is sufficient need.

### 2.6 TTM
Test Traffic Measurements (TTM) is an active measurement system consisting of 105 operational probes [19] that has been operating since 1999. Most probes are located at ISPs and academic institutions within the RIPE region, with others in the United States, South America, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand. The clocks on the probes are synchronized using GPS to achieve 10-microsecond accuracy. With the exception of some probes in private meshes, the TTM project conducts full mesh measurements.

Probes regularly perform a series of active tests, including UDP one-way delay, traceroute, multicast performance (limited to sites with enabled multicast measurements), DNSMON measurements (see Section 2.7), and IPv6 pMTU discovery. Ad hoc measurements initiated by authorized users, such as ping tests and HTTP page fetches, are also supported. There are limits on the range of destinations and probing rates for ad hoc tests, and the results are not released to other sites or the public. To maintain system integrity, the probes are managed solely by the RIPE NCC, but special tests may be requested using the TTM framework, provided they do not significantly impact existing measurements.

Performance graphs are available via the TTM website to users who accept an electronic license agreement. Bulk data is published using the CERN ROOT format [20] to researchers who sign a paper license agreement. The total dataset is approximately 0.7 terabytes, with the 2008 dataset being 110 gigabytes.

### 2.7 DNSMON
The DNS Monitor project (DNSMON) collects data regarding the reachability and latency for some of the top levels of the DNS system [21]. Data is collected using 60 TTM probes not located in private meshes. The root domain, .com, .net, .org, e164.arpa, and 24 country code TLDs (mostly from within the RIPE region) are measured. Performance over both IPv4 and IPv6 is measured for probes with IPv6 connectivity. Name Server Identifier [22] information returned in the DNS response is retained and may be used in the future to generate per anycast instance graphs.

Summary statistics are available dating back to the commencement of the project.
