4.3.3 Testbed results
Figure 5(a) plots the path queueing delays for the LP10
and LP01 with S = 1500 bytes which are obtained from the
previous set of testbed experiments. Notice that B(h′)/C (h′)
(= 100 ms) is much greater than S/C (h′) (= 240 µs). We
denote the bin with the highest count for the LP10 as ˆΘj
and that for the LP01 as ˆΘj−1. As shown, ˆΘj−1 is the same
as B(h′)/C (h′). However, ˆΘj deviates from B(h′)/C (h′) by
about 11 ms, which is close to X (h∗) (= 1500 bytes/1 Mbit/s
= 12 ms). Therefore, the results validate the contribution
of X (h∗ ) to Θj, as modeled in Eqn. (11).
We also repeated the experiments by using a small probe
packet size S = 240 bytes (with the same bottleneck link
capacity C (h∗) = 1 Mbit/s) and a larger bottleneck link
capacity C (h∗) = 10 Mbits/s (with the same probe packet
size S = 1500 bytes), where B(h′)/C (h′) ≫ S/C (h′) for both
cases. As shown in Figures 5(b) and 5(c), ˆΘj−1 remains very
close to B(h′)/C (h′). Although ˆΘj may still deviate from
B(h′)/C (h′), the degree of the deviation becomes smaller,
because of the decrease in X (h∗).
The estimates of B(h′)/C (h′) made by the LP10 and LP01
are both prone to queueing delay at the non-congested nodes.
However, the eﬀect on the LP10’s estimate is generally more

signiﬁcant than the LP01’s, because the LP10’s delay always
contains X (h∗) which cannot be eliminated. Note that X (h∗)
could be signiﬁcant if the measurement is conducted using a
low-bandwidth residential link. Though the impact of X (h∗)
can be mitigated by choosing a smaller packet size for active
loss-pair measurement, this is not feasible for passive loss-
pair measurement. Whenever the packet size is not conﬁg-
urable, the LP01 should be used to avoid the bias.
4.4 Estimating H (h∗)’s link capacity
In this section, we show that another beneﬁt of the loss-
pair analysis is estimating H (h∗)’s link capacity from both
LP10’s delay and LP01’s delay, assuming that both LP10 and
LP01 observe the same congested hop H (h′). Subtracting
We conducted a new set of testbed experiments to eval-
uate this capability by conﬁguring R1 to emulate C (3) =
C (11) = 10 Mbits/s, and keeping C (5) = 50 Mbits/s and
B(5)/C (5) = 100 ms unchanged. Besides H (5), we also in-
troduced the Pareto On/Off cross traﬃc between X1 and X2
in the forward and reverse paths. Other conﬁguration set-
tings were unchanged. As a result, h∗ = 3 and h′ = 5. We
obtain the distribution of ∆j−1,j by a mutual subtraction
between Θj−1 and Θj measured from P01x– and P10xR00,
respectively, with S = 1500 bytes.
As shown in Figure 6(a), although ˆΘj−1 and ˆΘj are rel-
atively close to B(h′)/C (h′) = 100 ms, they also experience
a higher variation due to the more signiﬁcant cross traﬃc
throughout the round-trip path. On the other hand, the
probability density distribution of ∆j−1,j , shown in Fig-
ure 6(b), is symmetric about the peak at around 1.2 ms,
which corresponds to the transmission delay of H (h∗) (i.e.,
X (h∗) = 1500 bytes/10 Mbits/s). Thus, the peak of the
distribution, together with the packet size, gives an accu-
rate estimation of H (h∗)’s link capacity. We also note from
other testbed results (which are not shown in the paper)
that ∆j−1,j diminishes with the H (h∗)’s link capacity and in-
creases with the probe packet size. For example, for S = 40
bytes, we expect to use a microsecond bin size to make the
transmission delay stand out in the distribution of ∆j−1,j .
We also include the results for the reverse-path loss pairs
based on P00xR10 and P00xR01 in Figures 6(c)-6(d), and
they are obtained by conﬁguring C (9) = 50 Mbits/s and
B(9)/C (9) = 100 ms in the same testbed, and restoring the
link capacity of H (5) to 100 Mbits/s with unlimited buﬀer.
As a result, h∗ = 3 remains unchanged, but h′ = 9. Fig-
ure 6(c) shows that the corresponding ˆΘj−1 and ˆΘj are still
relatively close to B(h′)/C (h′) and experience a similar vari-
ation due to the signiﬁcant cross traﬃc introduced by X1
and X2. Moreover, as shown in Figure 6(d), ∆j−1,j is quite
similar to the forward-path results.
5. LOSS PAIRS IN THE INTERNET
We conducted end-to-end Internet path measurement be-
tween 26 February 2010 20:00 UTC and 17 March 2010 09:00
UTC, inclusively, using HTTP/OneProbe. The measure-
ment covered a total of 112 (= 8×14) network paths between
eight local universities in Hong Kong, denoted by UA–UH,
as the sources of the paths and the 14 PlanetLab nodes listed
in Table 1 as the destinations. Since HTTP/OneProbe per-
forms measurement in a legitimate web session, we installed
a mini_httpd (a web server) [40] at each PlanetLab node.
To monitor the path measurement from multiple sources
to multiple destinations, we deployed a management sys-
tem to dispatch the measurement tasks to the measurement
