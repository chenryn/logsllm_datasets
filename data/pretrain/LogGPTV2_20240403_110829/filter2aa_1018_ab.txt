       run_proc: requires -p and procedure number or defaults to 0 
   -f : select configuration file 
   -t : table number 
   -d : decade number 
   -p : procedure number 
   -s : data for sending 
   -lp : comma separated list of procedure numbers 
   -no: turn off negotiation attempts 
NOTE: This tool is fire and forget.  You will need to monitor the hardware 
lines 
      with a logic analyzer to determine success and failure or to read data. 
The second and primary client, "c12_18_optical_client.py," provides the user with a menu-based interface 
to the full functionality of the OptiGuard toolkit. This client communicates directly with a Smart Meter's 
optical port using a serial-based optical probe. The optical client functions in a similar manager to the 
hardware client. C12.18/19 messages are built to be sent to the meter and the meter's responses are 
received and parsed to determine the message data. Users are provided with the ability to read one or 
more tables at a time, write data to any table, and run all procedures leveraging any data the users 
decides to provide. 
NOTE: Use of the “c12_18_optical_client.py” script REQUIRES a valid C12.18 Security Code 
of the appropriate security level to make modifications or run procedures11 on correctly 
configured Smart Meters. 
The optical client parses several standard tables including the Table 00 (Configuration Table) and Table 
01 (General Manufacturer Identification Table). Users are also provided with other testing capabilities, 
such as brute force authentication, table fuzzing, and meter disconnect/reconnect. The strength of this 
client is its modularity. Users can easily add new functionality to this client and update the menu to 
provide access to the new capabilities. The following textbox contains the user menu that is used to 
interact with Smart Meters via the meter’s Optical Port.

The third client is the "client_framework.py" script. This script is a dummy client and is designed to be an 
easy starting point for new users. It provides the basics necessary to begin developing new functionality. 
This functionality can be moved to the optical client once it has been developed and tested. The following 
textbox contains the user menu that is used to interact with Smart Meters via the meter’s Optical Port.

All of the clients are augmented by configuration file "c12_18_config.txt" and logging functionality. The 
configuration file is used to store common values, such as C12.18 security codes, and settings. The 
logging functionality is necessary to document findings and results of testing. A generic 
"meter_passwd.txt" has also been included and provides the user with an example password file that 
could be used for brute force authentication testing. Users can build password files by hand or from data 
dumped from Smart Meter memory components using the "c12_18_extract_keys.py" script.

4.0 OPTICAL PORT RISK MITIGATIONS 
Mitigations of the risks posed by a Smart Meter's optical port depend on the capabilities of the utility's 
overall AMI solution. The following are a few mitigations that are known to exist in several AMI solutions. 
Brute Force Authentication - Most meters log authentication attempts. If these logs are 
collected by the head-end systems they can be used to detect brute force authentication 
attempts. 
Disconnect/Reconnects - Head-end systems can determine the current state of the meter and 
compare it to the expected state of the meter. Incident response procedures can be developed 
and implemented to react to unauthorized meter disconnects or reconnects. 
Configuration Modifications - Head-end systems can determine the current state of the meter 
and compare it to the expected state of the meter. Incident response procedures can be 
developed and implemented to react to unauthorized meter configuration modifications.  
In addition to these mitigations meter vendors and utilities should consider the following points. 
Meter Deployment Considerations - Meters that provide disconnect/reconnect functionality 
should not be deployed at locations responsible for critical infrastructures (e.g. cellular towers, 
water pumping stations). Identifying a change in a meter's status can take time which could lead 
to outages at critical times. 
Meter Passwords - Utilities should use more than one authentication password for their 
meters. It is not generally feasible to generate unique passwords for every meter, which could 
lead to millions of passwords. Utilities can use several methods to make smaller group passwords 
such: a different password for residential and commercial meters types, a different password for 
each vendor, passwords computed using the zip code of a meter, etc. 
Secure Password Storage - meter vendors should determine ways to secure passwords stored 
on the meter and to protect them when being communicated between the meter's hardware 
components. 
Brand Issues - By understanding that attacks can occur on meters and successful modifications 
will become public knowledge, utilities can prepare statements and responses for the media. 
Service Level Agreements - Utilities need to learn to develop and modify service level 
agreements (SLA) with their AMI vendors to ensure that the vendors are identifying and 
addressing situations which impact AMI reliability, including security, in a timely manner. 
Incident Response Planning - Utilities should develop incident response plans associated with 
AMI resources. Procedures should be developed , tested, and implemented for identifying and 
responding to unauthorized meter modifications and meter-centric attacks. Solution vendors can 
begin this process by documenting incident response scenarios and distributing them with the 
rest of the solution documentation.

5.0 CONCLUSION 
The optical ports of Smart Meters are intended to provide utilities with a safe method to directly manage 
individual meters. This capability is necessary to ensure the reliability of these increasingly complex and 
widely distributed devices while also protecting the field technicians servicing the meters. The 
management software developed and distributed by the meter vendors is intended to enable meter 
management, only. These tools do not provide methods for testing all situations, fuzzing of data and 
components, or brute forcing authentication mechanisms, nor should they. A separate class of tools to 
test unusual use cases is necessary. Flexible tools that can provide communications using the protocols 
outlined by ANSI C12.18, C12.19, C12.21, C12.22, IEC 62056-21, IEC 62056-53, and IEC 62056-61 are 
critical to ensure that Smart Grid solutions are reliable, effective, and secure. 
Tools such as the OptiGuard provide vendors with the ability to test their solutions during development 
and as new components are integrated into their solutions. These tools also provide utilities and other 
industries with the capabilities to validate vendor claims, test resource implementations, and determine 
functionality issues as solutions evolve over time. Open sourcing these tools to security research teams, 
utility security teams, and embedded device vendors is critical to reducing the costs associated with 
developing separate tools for the wide variety of AMI solution deployments. The experiences of these 
separate, and often segregated, testing teams can improve the utility industry’s knowledge base and 
ensure that all Smart Grid vendors and utilities benefit from the time and efforts devoted to similar, or 
exact, AMI implementations.
