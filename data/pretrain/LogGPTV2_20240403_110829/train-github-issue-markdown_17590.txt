### Issue Report: `@types/whatwg-fetch` and TypeScript Version Compatibility

#### 1. Problem with `@types/whatwg-fetch`
- **Package Version**: `@types/whatwg-fetch` 0.0.33
- **Error**:
  ```
  node_modules/@types/whatwg-fetch/index.d.ts(32,44): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'ReadableStream'.
  ```

  - **Attempted Solution**: I added `@types/whatwg-streams` to the `devDependencies` in `package.json`, but the error persists.

#### 2. TypeScript Version Compatibility
- **Current TypeScript Version**: 2.1.6
- **Latest Stable Version**: 2.5.2

  - **Upgrade Attempt**:
    - **Result**: After upgrading to TypeScript 2.5.2, I encountered a new set of errors:
      ```
      node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts(165,11): error TS2559: Type 'Component' has no properties in common with type 'ComponentLifecycle'.
      node_modules/@types/whatwg-fetch/index.d.ts(11,13): error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'fetch'.
      node_modules/@types/whatwg-fetch/index.d.ts(13,14): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'HeadersInit'.
      ```

    - **Additional Context**: My React Native project also experienced issues with TypeScript 2.5.2. It would be ideal if the issue could be resolved for TypeScript 2.1.6.
