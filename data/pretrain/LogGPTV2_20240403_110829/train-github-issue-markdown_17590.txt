  * I tried using the `@types/xxxx` package and had problems.  
@types/whatwg-fetch 0.0.33 version has failed with error "
node_modules/@types/whatwg-fetch/index.d.ts(32,44): error TS2304: Cannot find
name 'ReadableStream'."
I added @types/whatwg-streams to the package.json dev dependencies, but still
the failure exists.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript  
I am on version 2.1.6. Trying now with 2.5.2 which is the latest stable
version of tsc. Will update the issue once installation and verification is
done.
Got new set of errors on tsc 2.5.2
node_modules/@types/react/index.d.ts(165,11): error TS2559: Type 'Component' has no properties in common with type 'ComponentLifecycle'.  
node_modules/@types/whatwg-fetch/index.d.ts(11,13): error TS2451: Cannot
redeclare block-scoped variable 'fetch'.  
node_modules/@types/whatwg-fetch/index.d.ts(13,14): error TS2300: Duplicate
identifier 'HeadersInit'.
FYI, a lot of my react-native project also errored out with tsc 2.5.2. It
would be great if you could resolve the the issue for tsc 2.1.6
