I find that using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) without an integrated terminal significantly reduces my efficiency. Currently, I have to repeatedly type `make` in a separate bash window, remembering to save my changes with `Ctrl+S` each time. This setup also means I can't simply double-click on compile errors to navigate directly to the relevant line and file.

At a minimum, it would be beneficial to have an integrated shell that supports clicking on error messages to jump to the source code. Ideally, once the terminal is integrated, a macro could automate the process of saving all files and then executing `make`. This would substantially increase productivity.
