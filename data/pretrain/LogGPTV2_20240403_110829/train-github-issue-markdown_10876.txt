I'm finding VS Code is fairly hard to use efficiently without an integrated
terminal.  
I have to type make repeatedly in a separate bash window (remembering to hit
ctrl-s every time!), and from there, I can't double-click on compile errors to
go to the line+file.  
At a minimum, it would be good to have an integrated shell, and support
clicking errors to go to the source.
Ideally, once integrated, a macro could: save all -> execute `make`, and
productivity would increase substantially.
