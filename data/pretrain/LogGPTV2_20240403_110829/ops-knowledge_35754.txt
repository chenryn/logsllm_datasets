User: In network security, how to detect and prevent DDoS attacks? What steps do you need to take to ensure reliability and sustainability?
Assistant: 1. Detecting DDoS attacks: DDoS attacks can be detected using network security equipment and tools, such as network warning systems, intrusion detection systems, and traffic analysis tools. 2. Prevent DDoS attacks: The following measures can be taken to prevent DDoS attacks: - Strengthen network security protection: use firewalls, DDoS protection equipment and other measures to strengthen network security protection. - Increase bandwidth: improve bandwidth and load balancing capabilities, and reduce the impact of DDoS attacks on normal data flows. - Limit concurrent connections: Set rules such as IP connection limit and time limit, limit the maximum number of concurrent connections for a single IP, and prevent attackers from using a large number of connections to occupy system resources. - Decentralized website deployment: By dispersing the website deployment, the attack range is smaller and cannot be actively targeted and tracked. - Strengthen password security: use complex passwords and certain authorization and authentication mechanisms to prevent hackers from using weak passwords to attack. - Make a good backup: Create multiple different backups to avoid the negative impact of data loss. The above measures can enhance the reliability and sustainability of the system and ensure the normal operation and sustainable development of the system.
