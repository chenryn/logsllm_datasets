displayed in the IBM MQ Explorer plug-in and is stored in your log database.
The Connect:Direct bridge agent must be IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition 7.0.4 or later. The
other agent involved in the transfer can be any version of Managed File Transfer. However, for information
about Connect:Direct nodes and processes to be logged, all MFT agents involved in the transfer must be
IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition 7.0.4 or later. For this information to be displayed in the IBM
MQ Explorer plugin, the plugin must be IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition 7.0.4 or later. For this
information to be stored in the log database, the database logger and database schema must be IBM
WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition 7.0.4 or later.
Log information about the Connect:Direct nodes and Connect:Direct processes involved in a file transfer
is included in the log messages that are published to the SYSTEM.FTE topic on the coordination queue
manager. For more information, see File transfer log message formats.
The following information is included in the published message:
• Connect:Direct bridge node name
• Primary node (PNODE) name
• Secondary node (SNODE) name
• Process name
• Process ID number
The Connect:Direct bridge node is the same node as either the primary node or the secondary node.
The value of the Connect:Direct bridge node name is the name that the bridge node is known to the MFT
Connect:Direct bridge agent by. The primary and secondary node names are the names that are used to
refer to the nodes in the network map of the Connect:Direct bridge node.

Solving permissions issues with Connect:Direct nodes
Use the information in this topic if your transfers between Managed File Transfer and Connect:Direct fail
with an error about insufficient permissions.
For transfers involving the Connect:Direct bridge, the user ID that connects to the Connect:Direct node is
determined by which IBM MQ Message Descriptor (MQMD) user ID is associated with the transfer request.
You can map specific MQMD user IDs to specific Connect:Direct user IDs. For more information, see
Mapping credentials for Connect:Direct.
You might see transfers failing with one of the following errors:
•
BFGCD0001E: This task was rejected by the Connect:Direct API with the
following error message: Connect:Direct Node detected error.
LCCA000I The user has no functional authority to issue the selp command
•
BFGCD0026I: Connect:Direct messages: The submit of the process
succeeded. Process number 1092 (name F35079AE, SNODE MYNODE)
executing. User fteuser does not have permission to override SNODEID.
User fteuser does not have permission to override SNODEID. User
fteuser does not have permission to override SNODEID.
If you see either of these errors, determine which Connect:Direct user ID is associated with the MQMD
user ID that was used for the transfer request. This Connect:Direct user ID must have authority to perform
the Connect:Direct operations required by the Connect:Direct bridge. For the list of functional authorities
needed, and guidance on how to grant these authorities, see Mapping credentials for Connect:Direct by
using the ConnectDirectCredentials.xml file.
What to do if text transfers to or from Connect:Direct nodes are not converting the data
correctly
When you transfer files in text mode between an MFT agent and a Connect:Direct node, code page and
end-of-line character conversion is performed. The transfer uses the operating system information in
the network map of the Connect:Direct bridge node to determine the end-of-line characters of a remote
node. If the information in the network map is incorrect, the end-of-line character conversion might be
performed incorrectly.
Ensure that the network map of the Connect:Direct bridge node and any Connect:Direct nodes that are
used as a transfer destination include the correct platform description.
• If your Connect:Direct bridge node is on a Windows system, ensure that for each remote node in your
network map you select the correct value from the Operating System list.
– If the remote node is on a Windows system, select Windows.
– If the remote node is on an AIX or Linux system, select UNIX.
– If the remote node is on a z/OS system, select OS/390.
Transfers to remote nodes on other operating systems are not supported by the Connect:Direct bridge.
• Ensure that for each remote node you transfer a file to or from, you specify the operating
system type of the remote Connect:Direct node in the ConnectDirectNodeProperties.xml file
in the Connect:Direct bridge agent configuration directory. For more information, see Configure the
ConnectDirectNodeProperties.xml file to include information about the remote Connect:Direct
nodes and Connect:Direct node properties file format.

What to do if transfers to PDS or PDS members through the Connect:Direct
bridge are failing
If the destination of a transfer is a Connect:Direct node on z/OS and is a PDS or PDS member, the transfer
fails if the -de parameter has not been specified with a value of overwrite.
About this task
If you submitted the transfer by using the fteCreateTransfer or fteCreateTemplate command,
perform the following steps:
Procedure
1.Change the command that you submitted to include -de overwrite.
2.Submit the command again.
Using the IBM MQ Explorer plugin
About this task
If you submitted the transfer by using the IBM MQ Explorer plugin, perform the following steps:
Procedure
1.Specify the source and destination information in the Create New Managed File Transfer wizard.
2.Select Overwrite files on the destination file system that have the same name.
3.Submit the command again.
Connect:Direct file paths specified with a double forward slash
If, as part of a file transfer, you specify a file located on a Connect:Direct node by using a file path that
starts with a double forward slash (//), the file is treated as a data set.
Sources and destinations on a Connect:Direct node are specified in the format
cd_node_name:file_path. If the file_path starts with a double forward slash (//), the source or
destination is treated as a data set. This is the case even when the Connect:Direct node is not on z/OS.
This can cause transfer failures if the file path is accidentally specified with a double forward slash (//) at
the start and the file is not a data set.
Ensure that you do not specify a file_path that starts with a double forward slash (//) if you do not want
the file that you specify to be treated as a data set.

Transferring data sets to and from Connect:Direct nodes
Increasing the number of concurrent transfers for the Connect:Direct bridge
To increase the number of concurrent transfers that the Connect:Direct bridge agent can process, you
must change three agent properties. You must also increase the maximum number of connections that
the Connect:Direct node accepts.
The maximum number of concurrent transfers that a Connect:Direct bridge agent can process depends
on the values of certain agent properties. The maxSourceTransfers and maxDestinationTransfers
agent properties have a default value of five transfers for a Connect:Direct bridge agent. This default value
is lower than the default of 25 transfers for other types of agent. A Connect:Direct bridge, where the agent
is configured with the default values of maxSourceTransfers and maxDestinationTransfers, can
164 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
process a maximum of 10 transfers at any one time: five transfers where the agent is the source, and five
transfers where the agent is the destination.
These default values ensure that the Connect:Direct bridge agent does not exceed the maximum
number of API connections to the Connect:Direct node. A Connect:Direct bridge agent with the default
configuration uses a maximum of 10 API connections to the Connect:Direct node. The maximum
number of connections accepted by a Connect:Direct node on AIX and Linux is controlled by the
api.max.connects Connect:Direct parameter. For a Connect:Direct node on Windows, the equivalent
parameter is max.api.connects.
If the rate at which your Connect:Direct bridge carries out large numbers of file transfers is not sufficient,
you can increase the number of concurrent transfers that the Connect:Direct bridge agent processes.
Change the following agent properties for the Connect:Direct bridge agent:
maxSourceTransfers
Set this property to a value that is larger than 5, but smaller than or equal to 25. If you choose a value
that is larger than 25, the agent might run out of memory unless you increase the amount of memory
that is available to the JVM used by the agent.
maxDestinationTransfers
Set this property to a value that is larger than 5, but smaller than or equal to 25. If you choose a value
that is larger than 25, the agent might run out of memory unless you increase the amount of memory
that is available to the JVM used by the agent.
ioThreadPoolSize
The default value of ioThreadPoolSize is 10. This property restricts the number of Connect:Direct
node API connections for transfers where the Connect:Direct bridge agent is the source agent. These
transfers are from Connect:Direct to Managed File Transfer. Use the following guidance to set the
value of this property:
• If the value of maxSourceTransfers is smaller than the value of maxDestinationTransfers,
set ioThreadPoolSize to double the value of maxSourceTransfers or 10, whichever is the
larger
• If the value of maxSourceTransfers is larger than the value of maxDestinationTransfers, set
ioThreadPoolSize to the sum of maxSourceTransfers and maxDestinationTransfers
In addition to these agent properties, you must also change the maximum number of concurrent API
connections for the Connect:Direct node that is part of the Connect:Direct bridge. The Connect:Direct
parameter that controls this number is api.max.connects if your node is on AIX and Linux, or
max.api.connects if your node is on Windows. Make the following changes to the appropriate
parameter:
api.max.connects (if the node in your Connect:Direct bridge is on AIX and Linux)
Set this parameter to a value larger than the sum of maxSourceTransfers and
maxDestinationTransfers. The default value of the api.max.connects parameter is 16. For
more information about how to set this parameter, see the Connect:Direct documentation.
max.api.connects (if the node in your Connect:Direct bridge is on Windows)
Set this parameter to a value larger than the sum of maxSourceTransfers and
maxDestinationTransfers. The default value of the max.api.connects parameter is 10. For
more information about how to set this parameter, see the Connect:Direct documentation.

Transfer:
Common problems
Common problems that might occur in your Managed File Transfer network.
• If a text transfer fails with the following error:
BFGIO0060E: Text data conversion has failed
This can occur for one of two reasons:
1.One or more characters in the source file cannot be converted from the source file code page to the
destination file code page. This problem can occur when code pages have different character sets
and certain characters cannot be converted between them.
If it is acceptable for conversion of some characters to not be converted, a replacement character
sequence can be defined at the destination agent so that the transfer does not fail. Specify the agent
166 Troubleshooting and Support for IBM MQ
property textReplacementCharacterSequence to define a replacement character sequence.
For more information, see Advanced agent properties: Input/output.
2.The source file encoding does not match the default encoding of the source agent. In this case
performing a text transfer by using the default settings corrupts the character data. To transfer a
source file that does not have the same encoding as the source agent, perform one of the following
steps:
a.Specify the file encoding in a transfer definition file. For more information, see Using transfer
definition files.
b.Specify the file encoding by using the -sce parameter with the fteCreateTransfer command.
For more information, see the topic fteCreateTransfer: start a new file transfer.
c.Specify the file encoding as part of an Ant move or copy task. For more information, see Using
Apache Ant with MFT.
To check that you have selected the correct source file encoding for a transfer perform the following
steps:
1.Set the destination file encoding to UTF-8.
2.Transfer the file in text mode.
3.Use a UTF-8 file viewer to view the contents of the file. If all characters in the file are correctly
displayed, the source file encoding is correct.
• If you see the following output from the fteCreateAgent command:
BFGMQ1007I: The coordination queue manager cannot be contacted or has refused a
connection attempt.
The IBM MQ reason code was 2058. The agent's presence will not be published.
it indicates that the coordination queue manager cannot be contacted and provides the IBM MQ reason
code for why. This information message can indicate that the coordination queue manager is currently
unavailable or that you have defined the configuration incorrectly.
• If you are using user exit routines and there is a failure while the user exit is being called or just after the
exit has been called, for example a product failure or power cut, it is possible the user exit will be called
more than once.
• If you have an agent with a queue manager on a system with an IP address that is assigned by DHCP
(rather than a static IP address), and the agent connects to that system by using a client TCP/IP
connection, you must start the agent with the following system environment variable set:
– On Windows:
set BFG_JVM_PROPERTIES="-Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=value"
– On AIX and Linux:
export BFG_JVM_PROPERTIES="-Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=value"
where value is the time interval in seconds between each flush of the cached DNS values of the JVM.
If the IP address of the queue manager system is reassigned for any reason (for example, because
of a network outage, an IP lease expiry, or a system reboot), the agent reports its lost connection to
the queue manager. After the JVM DNS cache is flushed, the agent can successfully reconnect. If this
environment variable is not set, the agent cannot reconnect in this scenario without a JVM restart. This
behavior is because the JVM internally caches the IP addresses of host names and does not refresh
them by default.
• If you run the fteStartAgent command and see the following error message, your environment
probably has additional library paths that conflict with Managed File Transfer:
BFGCL0001E: An internal error has occurred. The exception was: 'CC=2;RC=2495;AMQ8568:
The native JNI library 'mqjbnd' was not found. [3=mqjbnd]
IBM MQ troubleshooting and support 167
If the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LIBPATH environment variable is set to reference a 64-bit version of the
library before the 32-bit version when the agent is running with a 32-bit version of Java (as is currently
the case for most platforms), this error occurs.
To resolve this issue, set the Managed File Transfer agent property javaLibraryPath to reference the
correct location for the library. For example, for mqjbnd on AIX, set to: /usr/mqm/java/lib. For
mqjbnd on Linux, set to: /opt/mqm/java/lib
• If you have enabled user authority checking by specifying authorityChecking=true in the agent
property file and all authority checks are failing even if the user has the required authority on the
relevant authority queue:
– Ensure that the user that runs the agent has ALT_USER access control on the agent queue manager.
• If you have enabled user authority checking by specifying authorityChecking=true in the agent
property file and IBM MQ error messages are written to the agent output0.log file perform one of the
following actions:
– Ignore the messages, the agent is not affected.
– Grant the user who runs the agent GET authority on the SYSTEM.FTE.AUTH* queues belonging to the
agent.
• If you have edited the agent property file and the agent has not picked them up:
– Restart the agent, to ensure that the agent reads the new properties.
z/OS
• If you are using the agent on z/OS to transfer to a PDS or PDSE data set and an abend occurs, your
system might have limited disk space. The abend is likely to have a system completion code of B14 with
a return code of 0C, indicating there is no space left.
If you are transferring to a sequential data set, the transfer fails and indicates the out-of-space
condition, but the agent remains operational.
• If you are using the agent on z/OS, and the WMQFTEP task generates some Java core dumps before
becoming unresponsive, apply OMVS system services APAR OA43472.
• If you see the following output when running a configuration or administration script on z/OS:
FSUM7332 syntax error: got (, expecting Newline
this output indicates that the environment variable _BPXK_AUTOCVT=ON has not been set in the
environment where the configuration or administration script is being run. For more information about
this environment variable and how to set it, see Environment variables for MFT on z/OS.
Common MFT problems with JZOS
Here are some suggestions if you encounter problems with JZOS.
• If the JZOS fails to process successfully:
– Add, PARM='+T' to the JCL. For example:
//MQMFT EXEC PGM=JVMLDM86,REGION=0M,PARM='+T'
– Add set -x to the environment file
• If you get:
JVMJZBL1038E Child shell process exited with exit code: 1
JVMJZBL1042E JZOS batch launcher failed, return code=102
