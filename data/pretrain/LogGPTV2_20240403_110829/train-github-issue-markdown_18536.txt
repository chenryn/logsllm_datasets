The current implementation of autowiring seems to force unnecessary coupling
and to be instable in case of change in a vendor's service implementation.
Example 1:
    interface IA
    interface IB extends IA
    *service* class C implemets IB
I can autowire using the type hint `IB`, but not `IA`.
Example 2:
    interface I
    class CA implements I
    *service* class CB extends CA
I cannot type hint on `I`.
This means, autowiring would break if an intermediary interface or an abstract
class were added. Nothing in the documentation
(http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/autowiring.html)
mentions this limitation and it seems highly counter-intuitive.
If you agree this should be addressed, I am ready to provide a PR to fix this.
