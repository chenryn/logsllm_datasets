**Abstract:**
Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are domain names that include non-ASCII characters. Despite being part of the DNS for over 15 years, there is limited understanding of their development and security implications. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the IDN ecosystem and the cyber-attacks that exploit IDNs.

We conducted the most comprehensive measurement study to date, using IDNs discovered from 56 TLD zone files. By correlating data from sources such as WHOIS, passive DNS, and URL blacklists, we gained several insights. Our findings are multifaceted. On one hand, 1.4 million IDNs have been actively registered under more than 700 registrars, with significant growth in East Asia. On the other hand, most registrations are opportunistic, lacking meaningful websites and having severe configuration issues, such as shared SSL certificates. More concerning is the rising trend of IDN abuse, with over 6,000 IDNs identified as malicious by URL blacklists. Additionally, 1,516 and 1,497 IDNs show high visual and semantic similarity to reputable brand domains, yet brand owners have only registered a few of these domains.

Our study suggests that the development of IDNs needs to be re-examined, and new solutions and proposals are required to address issues such as inadequate usage and new attack surfaces.

**I. Introduction**

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses and is a fundamental component of the Internet infrastructure. Initially, domain names were limited to English letters, digits, and hyphens. To build a multilingual Internet and make it more accessible, especially for non-English speaking users, the IETF proposed the Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) initiative, which supports domain names encoded with Unicode characters.

Despite its long history, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of IDNs in the contemporary Internet ecosystem. No studies have answered basic questions about the number of registered IDNs and their primary uses. IDNs have faced criticism, particularly regarding security issues. Prior research has focused on the homograph attacks that IDNs can facilitate, where attackers create visually similar domain names to well-known brands by substituting ASCII characters with Unicode characters. Although known for a decade, these attacks have only recently gained attention after researchers demonstrated a nearly perfect phishing attack against apple.com, with several major browsers being vulnerable. 

While the security concerns are significant, it is premature to declare the IDN initiative a failure. Instead, we need to reassess the development of IDNs and the scale of their abuse.

**II. Background**

In this section, we provide an overview of how domain names and IDNs are created, followed by the translation mechanisms and homograph attacks facilitated by IDNs.

**Domain Names:**
A domain name is a hierarchical string, with each level corresponding to a zone. The DNS root zone, represented by a dot, is at the top of the hierarchy. Below the root zone are Top-Level Domains (TLDs), including generic TLDs (gTLDs), country-code TLDs (ccTLDs), and sponsored TLDs (sTLDs), managed by registries like Verisign. Under TLDs, Second-Level Domains (SLDs) are offered to the public by different registrars, such as GoDaddy. For example, in www.example.com, the TLD is "com" and the SLD is "example.com."

**Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs):**
Initially, domain names were restricted to English letters, digits, and hyphens. To enable the use of domain names in native languages, ICANN issued guidelines and instituted a program to support the development and promotion of IDNs, which encode language-specific scripts or alphabets in multi-byte Unicode. Many efforts have been made by the Internet community to regulate IDNs and promote their adoption.

While Unicode characters have been allowed at second and deeper levels for a long time, it was not until 2009 that their use at the top level (called iTLDs) was approved. Now, both ccTLDs and gTLDs allow Unicode characters. The support from the domain industry is broad, with all popular registries (e.g., .com, .net, and .org) accepting IDN registration, and 150 iTLDs installed in the DNS root zone, such as .中国 (xn--fiqs8s, China).

For a domain registrant, obtaining an IDN SLD from a registrar involves an additional step compared to registering a non-IDN SLD. According to Verisign, upon receiving a registration request, the registrar first converts the requested domain into an ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE) string and submits it to the Shared Registration System (SRS) for validation. If the domain name is valid and not registered, the requested IDN is installed into the corresponding TLD zone. At the top level, the process of applying for an iTLD is similar to a new gTLD application, with ICANN conducting a thorough review, typically taking around 20 months.

**Punycode:**
Although IDNs with non-ASCII characters are supported by DNS, they must be converted to ASCII characters to maintain backward compatibility in many network protocols. The Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) mechanism defines the translation between IDNs and their corresponding ACE strings, and has been adopted by major browsers and email applications. Before issuing a DNS request for an IDN, the domain name is translated into its ASCII version, or Punycode. Punycode uses the Bootstring algorithm to convert non-ASCII characters, keeping all ASCII characters, encoding the location of non-ASCII characters, and re-encoding the non-ASCII characters with generalized variable-length integers. A prefix "xn--" is added to the converted Punycode. When an IDN is displayed, the Bootstring algorithm is reversed to compute the Unicode values from the ACE.

**Homograph Domain Name Spoofing Attack:**
Different languages may have characters with similar shapes, allowing attackers to create IDNs that visually resemble known brand domains, leading to phishing attempts. This type of attack, called homograph domain name spoofing, has been known since the early days of IDN implementation. In April 2017, a security researcher demonstrated a highly effective phishing webpage mimicking apple.com using an IDN that visually resembled the brand domain in the Google Chrome address bar. The trick involved replacing the ASCII "a" (U+0041) in apple.com with the Cyrillic "a" (U+0430) in the registered IDN. This attack raised widespread concern and led to quick fixes from major browsers, some even discontinuing support for IDNs. However, the issue remains unresolved, as discussed later in Section VI-A.

**III. Data Collection**

Previous studies have collected IDNs from user network traffic, resulting in small data volumes. In contrast, we collected IDNs by scanning TLD zone files and utilized auxiliary data such as WHOIS and passive DNS to understand the development and distribution of IDNs. Below, we detail each data source, and Table I summarizes the statistics.

**TLD Zone Files:**
While Unicode is allowed at any level of the domain name hierarchy, we focused on IDNs embedding Unicode at the second and top levels, as these can be obtained from publicly available zone files. For second-level IDNs, we downloaded three zone file snapshots from Verisign (for .com and .net) and PIR (for .org), identifying IDNs using the "xn--" prefix. For top-level IDNs, we searched for the "xn--" substring in TLDs and collected 53 zone files related to iTLDs (all domains under these TLDs are IDNs). We scanned over 154 million domain names from three gTLDs and 53 iTLDs, extracting 1,472,836 IDNs, making our data scale several orders of magnitude larger than previous studies. Over two-thirds of these IDNs are registered under the .com TLD.

To compare the characteristics of IDNs to those of non-IDNs, we randomly sampled 1M, 100K, and 100K non-IDNs from .com, .net, and .org zone files, respectively.

**WHOIS Database:**
To obtain registration information for IDNs, we used WHOIS records published by registrars. Our industrial partners helped us obtain WHOIS information for 739,160 (50.19%) IDNs and parsed them using various tools, such as python-whois. The main reasons for missing WHOIS data for the remaining IDNs were request blocks from some registrars and parsing failures from the WHOIS crawler. Support for iTLDs from WHOIS parsers is poor, with only 1.1% of IDNs under iTLDs correctly parsed.

**Passive DNS:**
For each IDN, we are interested in the volume of network traffic it receives and the time period of user visits. We leveraged passive DNS data from the 360 DNS Pai Project and Farsight Security. The DNS Pai project has been collecting DNS logs from a large array of DNS resolvers since 2014, handling 240 billion DNS requests per day. With no query limit, we submitted all 1.4 million IDNs for their DNS logs. The Farsight passive DNS database has better coverage of resolvers outside China but has a query limit of only a thousand domains per day. Therefore, we only requested DNS logs for abusive IDNs detected by our system. Both data sources provide statistics of DNS look-ups aggregated per domain, including the number of look-ups and timestamps of the first and last look-up. Our collected data from DNS Pai spans from 2014/08/04 to 2017/10/13, and from Farsight, it spans from 2010/06/24 to 2017/12/03.

**URL Blacklist:**
Since IDNs can be abused to launch homograph attacks, we wanted to determine the prevalence of IDN abuse and identify other attack vectors. We used three URL blacklists from VirusTotal, Qihoo 360, and Baidu. If an IDN is flagged by any of the blacklists, we considered it malicious. In total, our blacklists...
