Abstract—Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are domain
names containing non-ASCII characters. Despite its installation
in DNS for more than 15 years, little has been done to understand
how this initiative was developed and its security implications. In
this work, we aim to ﬁll this gap by studying the IDN ecosystem
and cyber-attacks abusing IDN.
In particular, we performed by far the most comprehen-
sive measurement study using IDNs discovered from 56 TLD
zone ﬁles. Through correlating data from auxiliary sources like
WHOIS, passive DNS and URL blacklists, we gained many in-
sights. Our discoveries are multi-faceted. On one hand, 1.4 million
IDNs were actively registered under over 700 registrars, and
regions within east Asia have seen prominent development in IDN
registration. On the other hand, most of the registrations were
opportunistic: they are currently not associated with meaningful
websites and they have severe conﬁguration issues (e.g., shared
SSL certiﬁcates). What is more concerning is the rising trend
of IDN abuse. So far, more than 6K IDNs were determined
as malicious by URL blacklists and we also identiﬁed 1, 516
and 1, 497 IDNs showing high visual and semantic similarity
to reputable brand domains (e.g., apple.com). Meanwhile, brand
owners have only registered a few of these domains.
Our study suggests the development of IDN needs to be re-
examined. New solutions and proposals are needed to address
issues like its inadequate usage and new attack surfaces.
I. INTRODUCTION
Domain Name System (DNS) provides translation between
domain names and IP addresses and is one of the corner-
stones in the Internet infrastructure. In the beginning stage
of Internet, only letter, digits, and hyphen were allowed and
most of the domain names came from English words. To build
a multilingual Internet and make the access easier for people
around the globe, especially from eastern countries, IETF
proposed Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) initiative and
established standard to support domain names encoded with
Unicode characters.
Despite its long history (more than 15 years after the ﬁrst
IDN installation), we still lack a good grasp of how IDN is
positioned in the contemporary Internet ecosystem. So far,
there is no comprehensive study to answer basic questions
like how many IDNs are registered and what are their main
usage. In fact, IDN has been constantly receiving criticisms.
Prior works about this topic all focused on the security issues
it brings in [21, 25, 35, 37]. Since an IDN registrant is free to
choose characters of any language, she can create an IDN
looking almost the same as a brand domain by replacing
certain ASCII characters with Unicode characters. Such attack
is called homograph attack. Interestingly, though this attack

is known for a decade, it hasn’t caught people’s attention
till recently as researchers demonstrated that a nearly perfect
phishing attack against apple.com is possible with the help of
IDN, and several major browsers were vulnerable [36]. Despite
the security issues, we believe it is still too early to claim
failure of the IDN initiative. Instead, we need to revisit the
development of IDN and examine the scale of IDN abuse.
Our study. In this paper, we performed a measurement of
IDN ecosystem from both business and security perspectives.
Different from prior works constructing IDN dataset from
network trafﬁc [25, 37], we obtained IDNs by scanning the
entire zone ﬁles of popular gTLDs and iTLDs. We were able
to compile a list containing 1.4 million IDNs registered under
56 TLDs. Compounding this list, we collected auxiliary data
including three blacklists, WHOIS, passive DNS and SSL
certiﬁcates to study the characteristics of IDNs (Section III).
In particular, we looked into the languages associated with
IDNs, registration statistics, presence in terms of DNS trafﬁc,
domain usage and security enforcement in terms of HTTPS
deployment (Section IV). These results were also compared
to non-IDNs. To assess how IDN is abused now, we ﬁrst
performed an empirical analysis on the malicious IDNs labeled
by blacklists (Section V). In addition to the known homograph
attack, we also identiﬁed a new type of IDN attack which
exploits the semantic similarity between IDN and brand do-
main (called semantic attack). We developed two methods to
identify IDNs potentially used for homograph and semantic
attacks (Section VI and Section VII).
Findings. Putting together, our study shows a large volume
of IDNs have been registered under many registrars but their
value to Internet users is limited so far. The issue of IDN abuse
indeed requires more attention from our community. Here we
highlight some of the ﬁndings: 1) The 1.4 million IDNs we
identiﬁed are provided by over 700 registrars. However, only
a small proportion (below 20%) serves meaningful websites
and mis-conﬁguration exists in almost all HTTPS-enabled
IDNs (over 97%). 2) Most of the mainstream browsers have
responded to the latest homograph attack but several browsers
are still vulnerable. What’s more, through our detector, 3,013
registered IDNs were found to have high visual or semantic
similarity with known brand domains. Only 6.0% of them
were registered pro-actively by brand owners. The space for
IDN abuse is substantial, as at least 47K IDNs (most of them
unregistered) could be used for homograph attack.

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we brieﬂy overview how domain names and
IDNs are created, followed by the translation mechanisms and
homograph attacks powered by IDN.
Domain names. A domain name is presented in a hierarchical
string with each level related to a zone. DNS root zone
(represented as a dot) is the top of the domain hierarchy. Under
DNS root zone is Top-Level Domain (TLD), including generic
TLD (gTLD), country-code TLD (ccTLD) and sponsored TLD
(sTLD), which are managed by registries like Verisign. Under
TLD, Second-Level Domains (SLD) are offered to public by
different registrars, like GoDaddy. As an example, the TLD
and SLD of www.example.com are com and example.com.
Internationalized Domain Name (IDN). As mentioned, do-
main names in the beginning only allowed English letters,
digits and hyphens. To enable people around the world using
domain names in their native languages, like Chinese and
Russian, ICANN issued guidelines and instituted a program
to support the development and promotion of IDN, which
encodes language-speciﬁc script or alphabet
in multi-byte
Unicode. So far, many efforts have been devoted by the
Internet community to regulate IDNs and push for wide
adoption [2, 12, 16, 24, 31–33].
While Unicode characters have been allowed at second and
deeper levels since long time ago, it was until 2009 that the
use of Unicode at top-level (called iTLD) was approved. Now
both ccTLD and gTLD allow Unicode characters. The support
from the domain industry is broad: all popular registries (e.g.,
com, net and org registries) accept registration of IDN below
TLDs, and 150 iTLDs have been installed into the DNS root
zone, such as
(xn–ﬁqs8s, China)
For a domain registrant, getting an IDN SLD from a regis-
trar is straightforward, with only one more step than registering
a non-IDN SLD. According to Verisign [51], upon receiving
a registration request, the registrar should ﬁrst convert the
requested domain into an ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE)
string, and subsequently submit the ACE string to the Shared
Registration System (SRS) for validation. When the domain
name is valid and not registered, the requested IDN will be
installed into the corresponding TLD zone. At the top level,
the process of applying for an iTLD is similar to a new gTLD
application, in which ICANN takes a thorough review and the
whole process usually takes 20 months in average.
Punycode. Although IDNs with non-ASCII characters are
supported by DNS,
they have to be converted to ASCII
characters to retain backward compatibility in many network
protocols. Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications
(IDNA) is such a mechanism that deﬁnes the translation
between IDN and its corresponding ACE string [16], and
has been adopted by major browsers and email applications.
For these applications, before issuing a DNS request of an
IDN, the domain name is translated into its ASCII version,
or Punycode [12]. Speciﬁcally, Punycode uses an algorithm
called Bootstring for such conversion, which keeps all ASCII
characters, encodes the location of non-ASCII characters,
and re-encodes the non-ASCII characters with generalized
variable-length integers. A preﬁx xn − − is added to the
converted Punycode after the above process. When an IDN is
displayed by applications, the Bootstring algorithm is reversed
to compute the Unicode values from ACE.
Homograph domain name spooﬁng attack. As different
languages may have characters with similar shapes, attackers
can construct an IDN with high visual resemblance to a known
brand domain,
in an attempt for phishing. Such attack is
called homograph domain name spooﬁng, which was known
at the beginning of IDN implementation [25]. However, even
10 years later, the problem still exists and plagues major
browsers. In April 2017, a security researcher demonstrated
that it is possible to create a phishing webpage highly similar
to apple.com, using an IDN which visually resembles the
brand domain when displayed in the Google Chrome address
bar [36]. The trick is to replace the ASCII “a” (U+0041) in
apple.com with Cyrillic “a” (U+0430) in the registered IDN.
This attack raised broad attention and led to quick ﬁxes from
major browsers, some even terminating the support of IDN.
However, this issue is not entirely addressed, as described later
(Section VI-A).
III. DATA COLLECTION
Previous studies collected IDNs from network trafﬁc from
users [25, 37] and the data volume is small. On the contrary,
we collected IDNs by scanning zone ﬁles of TLDs. In addition,
we utilized auxiliary data like WHOIS and passive DNS to
learn the development and distribution of IDNs. Below we
elaborate each source and Table I summarizes the statistics.
TLD zone ﬁles. While Unicode is allowed to appear within
any level of domain name hierarchy, we focus on the IDNs
embedding Unicode at 2nd-level and top-level, because they
can be obtained from zone ﬁles available to public. For 2nd-
level IDNs, we downloaded three zone ﬁle snapshots from
Verisign (for com and net) [52] and PIR (for org) [44], and
identiﬁed IDNs using the preﬁx xn − −. For top-level IDNs,
we also searched substring xn − − in TLDs, and collected 53
zone ﬁles regarding iTLD [26] (all domains under these TLDs
are IDNs). In the end, we scanned over 154 million domain
names from three gTLDs and 53 iTLDs, and were able to
extract 1, 472, 836 IDNs, making the data scale several orders
of magnitude higher than prior studies. Among these IDNs,
more than two thirds are registered under com TLD.
To compare the characteristics of IDNs to those of non-
IDNs, we also randomly sampled 1M, 100K and 100K non-
IDNs from com, net and org zone ﬁles.
WHOIS database. To obtain the registration information
of IDNs, we leveraged the WHOIS records published by
registrars. Our industrial partners helped us to obtain WHOIS
information of 739, 160 (50.19%) IDNs and parse them using a
variety of tools, like python-whois. The two major reasons for
missing WHOIS of the remaining IDNs are the request block
from some registrars and parsing failures from the WHOIS
crawler. In fact, the support of iTLD is very poor from WHOIS
parsers: only 1.1% IDNs under iTLDs are correctly parsed.

Passive DNS. For each IDN, we are interested in the volume
of network trafﬁc it received and the time period of the user
visits. To this end, we leveraged the passive DNS data provided
by 360 DNS Pai Project [46] and Farsight Security [17]. The
DNS Pai project has been collecting DNS logs from a large
array of DNS resolvers since 2014, which now handles 240
billion DNS requests per day. Because our account under DNS
Pai has no query limit, we submitted all 1.4 million IDNs for
their DNS logs. On the other hand, the passive DNS database
from Farsight has better coverage of resolvers outside China,
but has a query limit of only a thousand domains per day.
As a result, we only requested DNS logs of abusive IDNs
detected by our system. Both data sources provide statistics
of DNS look-ups aggregated per domain, which contain the
number of look-ups and timestamps of the ﬁrst and last look-
up. To notice, as listed in Table I, our collected data from DNS
Pai spans from 2014/08/04 to 2017/10/13. From Farsight, our
collected data spans from 2010/06/24 to 2017/12/03.
URL blacklist. Since IDNs can be abused to launch homo-
graph attacks, we want to learn whether IDN abuse is pervasive
and if there are other attack vectors originated from IDN. We
leveraged three URL blacklists from VirusTotal, Qihoo 360
and Baidu. If an IDN is alarmed by any of the blacklists, we
considered the IDN as malicious. In the end, our blacklists
