**Title: BlackHat Asia 2020: Biometrics & Privacy - Time to Face Off or is it FaceApp?**

Recently, the app FaceApp sparked significant outrage when it was alleged that the app was surreptitiously uploading photos from users' phones to servers in Russia without their consent and for potentially nefarious purposes. Although the evidence did not support these claims, the incident highlighted a broader concern: many of us use biometric security features on our phones without fully considering the implications. As security increasingly relies on biometric data for authentication and even national security purposes, consumers are often unaware of the potential impacts and whether this type of information is protected by privacy laws around the world.

In this talk, we will delve into the various types of biometric data, their uses by both government and private organizations, and whether the collection and use of such data are covered by privacy legislation, particularly in the APAC region but also more broadly. Understanding the applicable laws is crucial for determining the rights you, as the 'owner' of your biometric data, may have to protect this valuable information. You will learn how biometric data is protected by law and what steps you can take to safeguard yourself.
