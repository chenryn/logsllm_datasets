title:blackhat:asia-20 Biometrics &#38; Privacy: Time to Faceoff or is that FaceApp?
FaceApp sparked outrage recently when it was thought that the app was taking photos from your phone and uploading them to servers in Russia without permission and for nefarious reasons. The evidence didn't support this claim, but it was enough for many to raise their concerns.That the Twittersphere got all worked up wasn't news, but the fact that so many of us use the biometric security features of our phones without thinking about it is a cause for concern. Security is increasingly relying on our biometric data for authentication and even national security purposes, and consumers are handing over this information without understanding the potential impacts and whether this type of information is covered by the various privacy legislation around the world.In this talk, we will explore the various types of biometric data, their uses by both government and private organisations, and whether the collection and use of such data is covered by the privacy legislation in the APAC region in particular, but more broadly around the world. Knowing what laws apply enables you to determine what rights you as the 'owner' of the biometric data may have to protect your valuable biometrics. In this talk, you will learn what and how biometric data is protected by the law and what you may be able to do to protect yourself.
