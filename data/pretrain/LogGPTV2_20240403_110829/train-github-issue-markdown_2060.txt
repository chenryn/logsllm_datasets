We currently use scientific notation (E-notation) to print large integer
tensors. We shouldn't do this because it hides meaningful digits and because
E-notation corresponds to floating point data types in Python.
    >>> x = torch.ones(525076, dtype=torch.int)
    >>> x.sum()
    tensor(5.2508e+05)
    >>> x.sum().item()
    525076
