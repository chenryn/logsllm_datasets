User: How to use rsync command for file synchronization, backup and restore operations on Linux system?
Assistant: rsync is a commonly used tool for file synchronization, backup and restoration. It can realize incremental backup and partial replication, which solves the problems of long time required for copying data and high bandwidth consumption. The following is how to use the rsync command to perform file synchronization, backup and restore operations on the Linux system: 1. File synchronization: Synchronize the local directory /dir1 to the directory /dir2 of the remote server: rsync -avz /dir1/ user@remotehost: /dir2/ Among them, the -a option means to synchronize in archive mode, the -v option means to display the process, and the -z option means to enable compressed transmission. Synchronize the directory /dir2 of the remote server to the local directory /dir1: rsync -avz user@remotehost:/dir2/ /dir1/ 2. File backup: Backup the local directory /dir1 to the local directory /backup: rsync -avz / dir1/ /backup/ Back up the directory /dir2 of the remote server to the local directory /backup: rsync -avz user@remotehost:/dir2/ /backup/ 3. File restoration: restore the files in the local directory /backup to the local directory In /dir1: rsync -avz /backup/ /dir1/ Restore the files in the local directory /backup to the directory /dir2 of the remote server: rsync -avz /backup/ user@remotehost:/dir2/ The above is on the Linux system A method for file synchronization, backup and restore operations using the rsync command. Through the rsync tool, we can efficiently perform file synchronization, backup and restoration, avoiding the long time required for traditional data copying and high bandwidth consumption, and providing strong support for our data protection.
