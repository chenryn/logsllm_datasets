**Expected Behavior**  
Non-dragable region if div with `position: fixed;` and `-webkit-app-region:
no-drag;` is above div with `-webkit-app-region: drag;`
**Actual behavior**  
region becomes dragable if it's position is fixed and div below has `-webkit-
app-region: drag;`

Make frameless window, make non-fixed div which have dragging enabled, put
fixed div above and disable dragging. Still dragable.
