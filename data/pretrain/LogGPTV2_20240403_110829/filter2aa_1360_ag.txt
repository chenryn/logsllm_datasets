Page Screenshots, also known as FireShot, provides you with an easy solution to capturing all of your results. 
When enabled, this extension is a button in the upper right portion of your browser. It appears as a blue square 
containing the letter "S". Clicking the icon presents a menu with options. The best option is to select "Capture 
entire page" and then "Save to PDF". This will create a PDF document of the entire page exactly as it appears 
in your browser and then save it to anywhere you choose. The file can later be archived to a removable storage 
device. The title of the document will match the title of the web page and it will include the URL of the page.

This method is preferred over a standard screen capture for several reasons. A typical screen capture only 
captures the visible area and not the entire page. You must then open a program into which you "paste" the data 
and then save the file. This extension automates this and saves it in a format that is difficult to edit. This can be 
beneficial during testimony.
You can now extract embedded media files from websites by clicking the icon and selecting the appropriate file. 
If your desired media is going to be used in court, I recommend downloading all sizes available. If you only want 
a personal archive, the largest size should be downloaded. You will now have a pure digital extraction of the 
target video. This is better than a screen capture or recording of the video because there is less loss of data from 
analog conversion. If downloading a large number of videos, consider the script which will be explained soon.
This setting will change the default name of each page capture. Each file will be named a numerical value, 
followed by the website URL, followed by title, and followed by the date and time of capture. Changing the %n 
value to 0 and the Pad option to 3 will ensure that your captures always start with a numerical value of 0 and 
ascend chronologically. This can help determine the order of evidence you retrieved. Be sure to "Apply" and 
then "Save" after you have made your desired changes. Figure 3.11 displays a typical series of results. Notice 
that you can quickly see the order captured (first three digits), target website, description, and date & time.

• 
Right-click within the page and select "Take Screenshot".
• 
Choose "Save full page".
• 
Click "Download".
• 
Click on the Nimbus icon and choose the "gear" icon in the lower-right
• 
In the "File name pattern" field, insert {url}-{dde}-{date}-{time}. This will name every capture with 
the URL and tide of the target website along with date and dme of capture.
• 
Check "Enable Quick Screenshot" and select the "Entire Page" option in the first row and "Download" 
option in the second row.
One common failure of both FireShot and Nimbus is the capture of extremely large Social Network pages. 
While this is rare on computers that have ample resources such as processing power and RAM, it can be quite 
common on older machines with low specifications. Surprisingly, I have found FireShot to work better on large 
Twitter profiles and Nimbus to be best for large Facebook pages. I have no logic to offer for this discover}’. 
Again, having both at our disposal will make us better prepared for online evidence collection. When both fail, 
consider Firefox’s own solution on the next page.
The process ran for about three minutes and saved an image .png file to my default downloads director}’. It was 
several megabytes in size. The default filename includes die word Screenshot, date, and tide from the webpage.
1 loaded my own Twitter profile and scrolled back to posts from a year prior. This generated quite a long page 
and my computer fans increased speed due to the heat generated from my processor. I attempted a screen 
capture with both FireShot and Nimbus, and each failed. I then executed the following with Firefox.
After these changes, clicking the Nimbus icon in the menu bar will no longer present a menu with options. 
Instead, it will automatically select the entire page, apply the proper file naming, and download the capture as a 
maximum quality PNG file to your Desktop. While a PDF file created with FireShot is the preferred file format, 
a PNG file has other advantages. The PNG file is more universal and does not require PDF viewing software 
such as Acrobat Reader. However, PNG files are easy to edit, and establishing the integrity of the file may be 
difficult. I believe that Nimbus should be used as a supplement to FireShot.
Nimbus allows you to specify whether you want to capture only the visible portion of the page, the entire page, 
or a custom selection from the page. The drop-down menu presents these choices and the result is saved as a 
PNG file. This is not optimal for online investigations, but is better than no capture at all. Another feature of 
Nimbus is the ability to manipulate captures. I believe that this is bad practice as we usually want to provide the 
most authentic and accurate evidence as possible. I do not want to manipulate any potential evidence. Therefore, 
1 recommend the following configurations.
While FireShot is my preferred screen capture utility within Firefox, there are some instances where it does not 
perform well. If you have a target's Facebook page that has a lot of activity present, this may create a screen 
capture too large for FireShot. The rendering process will likely expend all of the computer's video memory and 
fail to create the file. When this happens, I use Nimbus as my first backup.
You may not like either FireShot or Nimbus. In general, you get what you pay for with these (they are free). 
When I have an extremely’ long Facebook or Twiner page, I find both of those options mediocre at best. Lately, 
I find myself using the embedded Firefox Screenshot utility more than anything else. Consider the following 
example.

This extension provides right-click access to the Exif data embedded into images. Later chapters explain what 
Exif data is and how it can be useful. With this extension enabled, you can right-click on any full size image 
located on a web page. The menu option is "View Image Exif Data" and a new window will open when selected. 
This window will identify’ any available metadata about the image. Figure 3.12 (left) displays the right-click menu 
with a new' option to View’ Image Exif Data. Figure 3.12 (right) displays partial results that identify die make 
and model of the camera used to capture an image.
When installed, you have a new' option in your browser. The menu allows you to choose a mobile operating 
system, such as iOS or Android, or a desktop browser such as Internet Explorer or Chrome. It will also allow' 
you to specify your operating system such as Mac or Window's. Whatever you choose, this data will be sent to 
any' site that you visit. If you visit a w'ebsite of a tech-sawy' target, he or she may know' that y'ou were looking 
around. You may also be revealing that you are using a specific browser, such as Firefox, and a Windows 
computer (common in government). You could now' change your agent to that of a mobile device or Google 
Chromebook which may not look as suspicious.
To do so, you would click on the menu bar icon; select the desired browser to emulate (such as Edge), select 
the desired operating system (such as Window's); choose exact offering (such as Edge 92.0.1 Window's 10); and 
click "Apply’ (container on window')". Click the "Test UA" button to visit a page which will confirm your new' 
active user-agent. To return to the default Firefox option in your native operating system, click on the "Restart" 
button and refresh the page. Figure 3.13 displays an example w'here a mobile version of Yahoo was delivered to 
a desktop computer. Figure 3.14 displays the same page without any' user-agent spoofing.
Occasionally, you may visit a w'ebsite that does not want to cooperate with Firefox. Browsers notify websites of 
their identity’ and websites can alter or refuse content to certain products. One example is that some older 
websites require Microsoft's Internet Explorer to view' die content. Even though Firefox is capable of displaying 
the information, a w'ebsite can refuse the data to the browser. Another example is mobile websites that display 
different content if viewing from an iPhone instead of a computer. This can now' all be controlled with User- 
Agent Switcher and Manager. Note that this is a different application than the recommendation within the 
previous edition of this book (User-Agent Switcher). User-Agent Switcher and Manager offers many new' 
features, one of which we will discuss in the Instagram chapter.
Overall, most photos on social networks do not contain any’ metadata. They have been "scrubbed" in order to 
protect the privacy of users. However, many blogs and personal websites display images that still contain 
metadata. While Chapter Twenty will explain online w’ebsites that display this data, a browser add-on is much 
more efficient. In myr experience, this extension will increase the amount of times that you will search for this 
hidden content.
