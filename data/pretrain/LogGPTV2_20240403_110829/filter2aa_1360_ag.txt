### Full Web Page Screenshots (FireShot Add-on)

#### Filename Template Settings

To customize the naming of your screen captures, access the "Options" area in the FireShot menu. Click on "Show filename template settings" and change the default value to the following:

```
%n-%u-%t-%y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S
```

### Documenting and Archiving OSINT Investigations

Documenting and archiving your progress in an OSINT investigation is crucial. If you do not have proof of your findings, they might as well not exist. The FireShot add-on provides an easy solution for capturing and saving your results. When enabled, this extension appears as a blue square with the letter "S" in the upper right portion of your browser. 

**Steps to Capture and Save:**
1. Click the FireShot icon.
2. Select "Capture entire page."
3. Choose "Save to PDF."
4. Save the file to your desired location.

The document will include the title of the web page and its URL, ensuring that all necessary information is preserved.

### Advantages of Using FireShot

- Captures the entire page, not just the visible area.
- Automates the process, eliminating the need to paste data into another program.
- Saves files in a format that is difficult to edit, which can be beneficial during testimony.

### Extracting Media Files

You can extract embedded media files from websites using FireShot. For court use, download all available sizes. For personal archives, the largest size is sufficient. This method ensures a high-quality digital extraction of the target video.

### Configuring Nimbus Screenshot

Nimbus is another useful tool for capturing web pages. To configure it:
1. Right-click within the page and select "Take Screenshot."
2. Choose "Save full page."
3. Click "Download."
4. Click on the Nimbus icon and select the "gear" icon in the lower-right corner.
5. In the "File name pattern" field, enter `{url}-{title}-{date}-{time}`.
6. Check "Enable Quick Screenshot" and select "Entire Page" and "Download."

### Handling Large Social Network Pages

Both FireShot and Nimbus may struggle with extremely large social network pages, especially on older machines. FireShot tends to work better on large Twitter profiles, while Nimbus is more effective for large Facebook pages. If both fail, consider using Firefox's built-in screenshot utility.

### Using Firefox Screenshot

Firefox’s built-in screenshot utility is a reliable alternative. To use it:
1. Load the target page.
2. Click on the camera icon in the address bar.
3. Select "Save full page."
4. Download the image.

This process creates a high-quality PNG file, which is more universal and does not require specific viewing software. However, PNG files are easier to edit, so ensure the integrity of the file if used for evidence.

### Exif Viewer Add-on

The Exif Viewer add-on allows you to access metadata embedded in images. To use it:
1. Right-click on any full-size image.
2. Select "View Image Exif Data."
3. A new window will open, displaying the metadata.

**Example Metadata:**
- Camera Make: Canon
- Camera Model: Canon PowerShot A590 IS
- Picture Orientation: Normal
- X-Resolution: 180 DPI
- Y-Resolution: 180 DPI
- Last Modified Date/Time: 2009-07-02 10:35:16

### User-Agent Switcher and Manager

This add-on allows you to change your browser's user-agent string, which can be useful when dealing with websites that restrict content based on the browser or operating system.

**Steps to Use:**
1. Click on the menu bar icon.
2. Select the desired browser and operating system.
3. Click "Apply."
4. Use the "Test UA" button to confirm the changes.

**Example:**
- Changing the user-agent to Edge on Windows 10 can help access mobile versions of websites.

### Conclusion

Using tools like FireShot, Nimbus, and Firefox’s built-in screenshot utility, along with add-ons like Exif Viewer and User-Agent Switcher and Manager, can significantly enhance your OSINT investigations. These tools provide efficient and reliable methods for capturing, documenting, and analyzing web content.
