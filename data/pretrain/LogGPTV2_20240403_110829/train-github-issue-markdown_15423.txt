this is to reopen #12410.
**Current behavior**
With the following routes:
    [{
      path: 'root',
      canActivateChild: [RootGuard],
      children: [{
        path: 'branch',
        canActivateChild: [BranchGuard],
        children: [{
          path: 'leaf', component: LeafCmp
        }]
      }]
    }]
when navigating to `/root/branch/leaf`, RootGuard will run **twice**.  
With more levels of nested routes, it's repeating more times. Generally,
canActivateChild will run repeatedly for each level of children.
**Expected behavior**
canActivateChild guard should only run once for a navigation.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
This is a bug with canActivateChild, and after walking through all test suites
related, no found of cases to test this.
Update: for example, if firing XHR request in the canActivateChild guard, the
requests may be repeated, that's apparently a perf issue.
