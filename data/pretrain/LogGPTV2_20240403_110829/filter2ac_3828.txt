On Android devices with a work profile, the `DevicePolicyManager.setPermittedCrossProfileNotificationListeners` method can be used to manage the list of applications running within the personal profile that are allowed to access notifications generated within the work profile. This policy specifically controls cross-profile notification access and does not affect notifications generated by other parts of the device.

Additionally, the `DevicePolicyManager.setApplicationHidden` method can be used to disable notification access for specific, unwanted applications. However, it is important to note that this method not only blocks notification access but also completely prevents the specified application from running on the device.
