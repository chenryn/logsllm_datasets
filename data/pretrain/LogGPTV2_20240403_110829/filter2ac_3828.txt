ATT&CK Technique Name:Enterprise Policy
On Android devices with a work profile, the DevicePolicyManager.setPermittedCrossProfileNotificationListeners method can be used to manage the list of applications running within the personal profile that can access notifications generated within the work profile. This policy would not affect notifications generated by the rest of the device. The DevicePolicyManager.setApplicationHidden method can be used to disable notification access for unwanted applications, but this method would also block that entire application from running.[10]
