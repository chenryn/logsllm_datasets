Question: You are tasked with choosing a hash function to pair with a symmetric encryption algorithm for a high-security system. If the encryption algorithm uses a 256-bit key, which hash function would you recommend, considering the computational difficulty for an attacker to break the encryption as well as the hash function's security?
"A": "SHA-256, because it offers a good balance between security and computational cost.",
"B": "SHA-512, because the larger output size offers the highest level of security.",
"C": "SHA3-512, because it provides security against length extension attacks and a large output size.",
"D": "SHA-384, as it provides sufficient security while acknowledging that an impractically high computational cost is already involved with breaking a 256-bit key."
Answer: D
