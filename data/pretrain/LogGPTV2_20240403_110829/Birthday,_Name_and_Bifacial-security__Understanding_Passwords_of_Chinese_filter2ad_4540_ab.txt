Type-1 research aims at evaluating the strength of a
password dataset (distribution) by measuring its statisti-
cal properties (e.g., Shannon entropy [10], α-guesswork
[7], λ-success-rate [53]) or by gauging its “guessability”
[24, 59]. Guessability characterizes the fraction of pass-
words that, at a given number of guesses, can be cracked
by cracking algorithms such as Markov-Chains [36] and
probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) [58]. As
with most of these previous studies, we mainly consider
trawling guessing [55], while other attacking vectors
(e.g., phishing, shoulder-surﬁng and targeted guessing
[56]) are outside of our focus. Hereafter, whenever the
term “guessing” is used, it means trawling guessing.
Type-2 research attempts to reduce the use of weak
passwords. Two approaches have been mainly utilized:
proactive password checking [25, 32] and password
strength meter [13, 59]. The former checks the user-
selected passwords and only accepts those that comply
with the system policy (e.g., at least 8 characters long).
The latter is typically a visual feedback of password
strength, often presented as a colored bar to help users
create stronger passwords [17]. Most of today’s leading

sites employ a combination of these two approaches to
prevent users from choosing weak passwords.
In this
work, though we mainly focus on type-1 research, our
ﬁndings are also helpful for type-2 research.
Existing work (e.g., [14,17,27,37,42]) mainly focuses
on passwords chosen by English speaking users. Rela-
tively little attention has been paid to the characteristics
and strength of passwords chosen by those who speak
other native languages. For instance, “woaini1314” is
currently deemed “Strong” by password strength meters
(PSMs) of many leading services like AOL, Google,
IEEE, and Sina weibo. However, this password is highly
popular and prone to guessing [56]: “woaini” is a Chi-
nese Pinyin phrase that means “I love you”, and “1314”
has a similar pronunciation of “for ever” in Chinese.
Failing to catch this would overlook the weaknesses
of Chinese passwords,
thus posing high risks to the
corresponding web accounts.
1.1 Motivations
There have been 802 million Chinese netizens by June,
2018 [1], which account for over 20% (and also the
largest fraction) of the world’s Internet population. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no
satisfactory answer to the key questions: (1) Are there
structural or semantic characteristics that differentiate
Chinese passwords from English ones? (2) How will
Chinese passwords perform against the foremost attack-
s? (3) Are they weaker or stronger than English ones?
It is imperative to address these questions to provide
both security engineers and Chinese users with necessary
security guidance. For instance, if the answer to the ﬁrst
question is afﬁrmative, then it indicates that the password
policies (e.g., length-8+ [25] and 2Class12 [44]) and
strength meters (e.g., RNN-PSM [38] and Zxcvbn [59])
originally designed for English speaking users cannot be
readily applied to Chinese speaking users.
A few password studies (e.g., [30, 36, 52, 53, 56]) have
employed some Chinese datasets, yet they mainly deal
with the effectiveness of various probabilistic cracking
models. Relatively little attention has been given to
the above three questions. As far as we know, Li et
al.’s work [26, 34] may be the closest to this paper,
but our work differs from it in several aspects. First,
we explore a number of fundamental characteristics not
covered in [26, 34], such as the extent of language de-
pendence, length distribution, frequency distribution and
various semantics. Second, our improved PCFG-based
