critical for the reliability performance. Figure 8 indicates 
that with the deployment of only one self-checking pair, 
this pair dominates the safety impact. With an increasing 
number  of  self-checking  pairs  deployed,  the  reliability 
impact  of  a  self-checking  pair  failure  on  the  system 
diminishes.  For  three  and  four  pairs,  the  numbers  are 
largely  the  same.  While  two  neighboring  nodes  can 
easily  be  paired

functionality  and  without  creating  a  swamping  effect, 
losing  hardware  because  of  failures  equivalent  to  more 
than two self-checking pair failures is probably already a

applications  in  the  automotive  domain.  Yet,  it  is 
interesting  that  one  or  two  self-checking  pairs  are  not 
enough  for  the  most  optimal  platform  dependability 
performance. 
5.6. Sensitivity to Service Interval Time  
This  paper  argues  that  removal  of  latent  faults  can 
only  occur when a car is serviced, approximately every 
150  hours.  Alternatively,  techniques  could  be  deployed 
that perform sufficient testing more often, say after every 
trip  (e.g.  when  the  car  electronics  is  powered  down). 
Similar  self-test  techniques  are  deployed  in  aerospace 
systems and—assuming independent devices self test and 
have sufficient error detection coverage—could decrease 
the “vulnerability”  window drastically. The low service 
interval  numbers  of  0.5  or  1  hours  should  model  such 
alternative approaches. 
In the past, a car’s operational life was approximately 
4000 hours [28]. Today, some manufacturer’s goals are 
even  higher  and  approaching  6000  hours.  The  long 
service intervals should show the effect if no scrubbing 
(latent  fault  detection)  is  done  during  the  vehicle  life 
time. Similarly, such long service intervals may address 
some effects of silicon wear-outs [21], as the failure rate 
may no longer be assumed to be constant. With loss of 
constant  failure  rates  the  “memory-less”  properties  of 
failure rates vanish and the actual age of the electronics 
comes into consideration.

service interval
Figure 9: Normalized reliability dependent on 
service interval 
Figure  9  should  show  some  of  the  platform  level 
effects. As expected, the safety is largely independent of 
service  intervals  for  the  “immediate  repair”  scenario. 
Recall  that  the  BRAIN  has  perfect  fault  detection 
properties  because  of  the  bit-for-bit  comparison  for  the 
platform  communication  propagation  service,  which 
explains the outcome.  
Except for the “no repair” scenario, all other scenarios 
“stabilize” (or stay nearly constant) at a safety level from 
50 hours service interval onwards. Once a failure occurs, 
another failure is unlikely within the interval to the next 
service. For the “no repair scenario,” the safety decreases 
at  a  higher  rate  and  the  dependability  decreases  with 
increasing  service  time,  reflecting  the  propensity  for 
faults when the platform is not scrubbed for latent faults 
and the “reliability clocks” of components are not reset. 
Similar behavior might be observed with effects such as 
aging silicon [21]. 
6. Conclusions 
links’ 
for  both 
The  results  presented  in  this  paper  illustrate  the 
benefits of the BRAIN’s hybrid behavior using the added 
‘skip 
integrity  and  availability 
augmentation.  The  full  coverage  of  the  high-integrity 
data  propagation  of  the  BRAIN  offers  a  significant 
improvement over the inline error coverage of the dual-
star  architectures.  The  half-duplex  BRAIN  also  has  an 
slightly better reliability overall, with fewer components 
and similar connectivity requirements. From our analysis, 
we  conclude  that  extended  operation  with  a  fault  is 
possible  with  certain  configurations  of  the  BRAIN 
architecture.  
Extended  operation  with dual  star  configuration also 
looks  promising  in  relation  to  x-by-wire.  However,  the 
star  architecture’s  sensitivity  to  the  quality  of  inline 
error-detection  mechanisms  have  also  been  illustrated. 
The ability to augment this with improved, higher-level 
diagnosis  functions  such  as  error  strike  counters  may 
considerably improve the system dependability claims. In 
addition,  the  introduction  of  strike  counters  into  the 
BRAIN  may  also  increase  system  dependability;  the 
refinement  of  such  strike-counting  policies  will  be  the 
subject  of  future  work.  Over-zealous  indictment  must 
also be carefully considered to reduce the risk of resource 
exhaustion from the impact of transient errors.  
The  reader  is  finally  cautioned  that  this  work  has 
assumed  a  constant  failure  rate  for  the  electronics 
components  examined.  As  the  impact  of  technology 
improvements  such  as  decreasing  geometries  and  the 
associated  vulnerabilities  of  silicon  wear-outs  [21]  are 
considered,  some  of  the  assumptions  that  underpin  the 
reliability  assessment  may  need 
revisited. 
Reliability assessment when such effects are considered 
may  be  a  considerable  challenge.  However,  the  full 
coverage  and  fault  detection  presented  by  architectures 
such as BRAIN may help mitigate such effects. 
Similarly,  frequent  and  regular  service  intervals  for 
testing  automotive  electronics  may  not  be  accepted  by 
customers,  as  prevention  of  failing  of  components may 
not be perceived as immediate added value to passenger 
safety.  The  model  in  this  paper  could  be  extended  to 
include more frequent self-test diagnosis (e.g. at power-
down),  which  typically  achieves  less  error  detection 
coverage,  but  may  achieve  higher  safety  numbers  for 
similar service intervals.
