**ATT&CK ID:** T1055.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Portable Executable Injection

Adversaries may employ portable executable (PE) injection to evade process-based defenses and potentially elevate their privileges. PE injection is a technique that involves executing arbitrary code within the address space of a separate, running process. This method allows malicious actors to hide their activities by injecting code into legitimate processes, making detection more challenging for security solutions.
