### Concept of Identifying Features from Passive DNS

We have developed a set of features from passive DNS data that indicate higher rates of churn. These features are tailored to our domain and integrate other signals of malicious network blocks.

### VIII. Conclusion

In this paper, we present the first publicly described method for detecting malicious network blocks that have been sub-allocated. Our method involves collecting Whois information and merging it with passive DNS data to create a set of features that can accurately detect these malicious sub-allocated network blocks. This approach is particularly useful for identifying modern Bulletproof Hosting (BPH) services, which have evolved from operating purely static BPH Autonomous Systems (ASes) to more agile services that rent network blocks from large service providers.

After validating our detection method, we conducted a large-scale study of the malicious network blocks it detected. This study provides new insights into the techniques used by BPH services to evade AS-based reputation metrics and fine-grained IP address blacklisting. We detected 39,000 malicious network blocks, none of which were allocated to what are considered BPH ASes, and many of which had little to no coverage in IP address blacklists.

While our method is not optimal, we have identified some limitations and potential directions for future research. We hope that the detection methods and ecosystem analysis presented will serve as a foundation for guiding and spurring additional open research on this topic. The ultimate goal is to develop increasingly effective and robust methods for detecting the evolving techniques used by BPH services to hide their infrastructure.
