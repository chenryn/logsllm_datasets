Consider the following example:
    trait Foo {
        fn foo(&self);
        fn bar(&self) where Self: Bar;
    }
    trait Bar {
    }
    struct Baz;
    impl Foo for Baz {
        fn foo(&self) {}
    }
The example produces the following error:
    :11:1: 13:2 error: not all trait items implemented, missing: `bar` [E0046]
    :11 impl Foo for Baz {
    :12     fn foo(&self) {}
    :13 }
However, `Baz` doesn’t implement `Bar`, and presumably it shouldn’t be
required to implement `bar` when implementing `Foo`.
