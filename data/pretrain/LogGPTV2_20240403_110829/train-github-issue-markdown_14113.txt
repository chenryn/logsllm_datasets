**Current behavior**  
Two oddities when using microsyntax to set variables on structural directives:
  1. An unused @input named exactly like the selector is required on structural directives.
    @Directive({
      selector: '[aDirective][aDirectiveFoo]',
      ...
    })
    export class ADirective {
      @Input() aDirective: any;  // Required, but explicitly set to "undefined".
      @Input() aDirectiveFoo: string;
    }
  2. An extraneous character followed by a space is required at the beginning for it to work.
Doesn't work:
Works:
**Expected behavior**
  1. Don't require or automatically insert the extraneous @input.
  2. Allow variable assignment without the required character and space.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Allow richer initialization and use of structural directives.
