10,000 runs measured on an Octa-core Dell desktop computer,
3.6GHz Intel Xeon. Signing is much faster than verifying
credentials—due to the pairing operation in the latter; veri-
ﬁcation takes about 10ms; signing a private attribute is about
3 times faster.
b) Communication complexity and packets size: Ta-
ble II shows the communication complexity and the size of
each exchange involved in the Coconut credentials scheme,
as presented in Figure 2. The communication complexity is
expressed as a function of the number of signing authorities
(n), and the size of each attribute is limited to 32 bytes as the
output of the SHA-2 hash function. The size of a credential
is 132 bytes. The highest transaction sizes are to request and
verify credentials embedding a private attribute; this is due

to the proofs πs and πv (see Section III). The proof πs is
approximately 318 bytes and πv is 157 bytes.
c) Client-perceived latency: We evaluate the client-
perceived latency for the Coconut threshold credentials scheme
for authorities deployed on Amazon AWS [2] when issuing
partial credentials on one public and one private attribute. The
client requests a partial credential from 10 authorities, and
latency is deﬁned as the time it waits to receive t-out-of-10
partial signatures. Figure 7 presents measured latency for a
threshold parameter t ranging from 1–10. The dots correspond
to the average latency and the error-bars represent the normal-
ized standard deviation, computed over 100 runs. The client is
located in London while the 10 authorities are geographically
distributed across the world; US East (Ohio), US West (N.
California), Asia Paciﬁc (Mumbai), Asia Paciﬁc (Singapore),
Asia Paciﬁc (Sydney), Asia Paciﬁc (Tokyo), Canada (Central),
EU (Frankf¨urt), EU (London), and South America (S˜ao Paulo).
