User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题how to autostart certaim program in windows 10? I have two users in windows 10, one is administrator.
Another one doesn't have admin rights.
So it cannot start exe-programm.

How can i make certain program startup with admin rights? 

I tried to login as administrator and set the programm autostart, but it doesnt actually run at the startup.

Assistant: You should create a task in Windows Task Scheduler.

1) Specify admin account in security options of general tab and mark box "Run with highest privileges"

2) Go to triggers and select "On logon", then specify particular user.
