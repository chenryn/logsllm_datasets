### Optimized Text

We conducted experiments over a circuit constructed using a set of 25 Tor relays. The target flow was allowed to run for 50 seconds before we simultaneously initiated all probe flows, each of which lasted for 600 seconds. Throughput data were recorded every 0.1 seconds. In total, 40 measurements were performed using RELAY-SET-1 in November 2010, and 150 measurements were conducted using RELAY-SET-2 in January-February 2011.

To quantify the attacker's uncertainty about the relays in the circuit, we utilized the entropy metric [15, 44] with a uniform prior (detailed in technical report [34]). Figure 6(a) illustrates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the bottleneck relay entropy for different window sizes, using a correlation threshold of 0.4. Our results indicate that while the attacks do not precisely identify the bottleneck relay, the entropy is significantly reduced. For instance, with a window size of 300 seconds, the entropy is less than 2.5 bits in half of the cases (out of a possible 4.6 bits). Similar findings were observed for correlation thresholds of 0.3 and 0.5.

In addition to reducing the entropy of the bottleneck relay, our attack also provides information about the non-bottleneck relays in the target flow. Specifically, if the mean throughput of a one-hop probe through a relay is lower than the mean throughput of the target flow, it is unlikely that the relay is part of the target flow circuit. Figure 6(b) shows the expected drop in entropy for a given throughput. We also plot the CDF of the Tor circuit throughput for comparison. Circuits with higher throughput exhibit lower entropy, as there are only a few high-throughput relays in the system. The average throughput observed in our experiment was 96 KBps, resulting in an instantaneous reduction of approximately 18% in the total entropy at any given point during the experiment.

Figure 6(c) demonstrates the effectiveness of eliminating relays with lower throughput than the target flow over time. Using this technique, we were able to reduce the entropy in our sample space by roughly 40% within the first ten seconds. Over a minute-long attack, the entropy of the bottleneck relay’s sample space was reduced by approximately 45%, as fluctuating probe bandwidth measurements allowed more relays to be excluded from consideration.

### 3.4 Identifying Guard Relays

Thus far, we have presented attacks that reduce the entropy of Tor relays in a single circuit. We now introduce attacks that can combine probabilistic observations over multiple circuits to identify a client’s set of guard relays. Our observation is that guard relays are more likely to appear in the anonymity set of bottleneck relays for a client’s circuit, as they have a higher probability of being selected compared to other relays. Therefore, over multiple circuit reformulations, the relays that most frequently appear in the anonymity set for a client’s circuit are likely to be the guard relays.

**Experimental Setup:**
In addition to restricting the client’s Tor application to use relays from a selected set of 25 relays, we also restricted its choice of guard relay. By configuring the client’s Tor application with the options `EntryNodes`, `StrictEntryNodes`, `UseEntryGuards`, and `NumEntryGuards`, we ensured that a specific relay was always used as the guard relay. The goal of this experiment was to analyze the vulnerability of using a fixed guard relay and to determine whether such a configuration allows the attacker to combine probabilistic observations over multiple circuits and identify the guard relay.

Similar to the previous experiments, we used 25 different machines for probing, with the target flow running for 700 seconds and the probe flows running for 600 seconds. We conducted three experiments, choosing the guard relays to be Fooligans, jalopy, and trusted, respectively. The experiments were performed 50, 20, and 50 times, respectively, between November 2010 and February 2011. These three relays were chosen to study the effectiveness of our attack against guard relays with varying capacities: Fooligans (82 KBps), jalopy (5.8 MBps), and trusted (17.4 MBps) as of February 2011.

**Results:**
Figure 7 shows the number of times a particular relay was selected in the anonymity set for the bottleneck relay used by the target flow. We used a correlation threshold of 0.4 and a window size of 400 seconds. As shown in Figure 7(a), the relay with the highest frequency of being in the anonymity set of bottleneck relays is Fooligans, which is indeed the guard relay for the client. This pattern was consistent across all three experiments.
