Question: Suppose you are reviewing the security of a sensor data handling system for a System on Chip (SoC) design. You encounter a code snippet that scales the sensor frequency value to calculate the sensed temperature using the formula: Sensed Temp = a + b * Sensor Freq, where a and b are programmable calibration data coefficients. Identify the measures that would address the weakness of missing write protection for sensor parametric data values to prevent potential hardware damage or operational failure.
"A": "Implementing a hardware-imposed limit on the maximum allowable values of coefficients a and b.",
"B": "Enforcing access controls to allow only trusted software to modify the calibration coefficients a and b.",
"C": "Periodically recalibrating the sensor at runtime to ensure that the coefficients a and b remain within safe operational limits.",
"D": "Storing the coefficients a and b in volatile memory so they are reset to default safe values upon system reboot."
Answer: B
