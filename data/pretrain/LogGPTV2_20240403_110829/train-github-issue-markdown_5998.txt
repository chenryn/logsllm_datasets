    Per email from Brad:
    It looks like what you don't actually care about owning the TCP connection and ideally
    just want something like:
     var clientClosed chan bool
     cn, ok := w.(http.CloseNotifier)
     if ok {
         clientClosed = cn.CloseChannel() // returns a chan bool, written to when/if this http request is closed
     }
     select {
      case <-clientClosed:
         // cancel expensive stuff
      case ....
      }
