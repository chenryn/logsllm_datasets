##### Description of the problem
`Three.js` Github repository is more than **700mb** big. It sounds like this
issue already came up and may be related to the Github history but I think
that is getting **REALLY** big and that'd be great if there are some Git pros
out there knowing how to deal with that!
Note `git shallow-clone` could be a work around it.
