User: How can I install (on Linux) a plain Python distribution to e.g. /opt/myPythonProject/python? When I afterwards install packages (e.g. pip) all packages should go in /opt/myPythonProject. It should simply ignore system python and it's packages. 
My ultimate goal is to place my own code in /opt/myPythonProject/mycode, then zip op the entire project root directory, to deploy it on customer machine. Does this in general work (assuming my own arch/OS/etc. is the same). 
So the bigger question is: can I deliver python/packages/my own code in 1 big zip? If yes, what do I need to take into account? 
If not: what is the easiest solution to distribute a Python application together with the runtimes/packages and to get this deployed as application user (non root).
Assistant: I use

virtualenv for multiple Python installations 
setuptools for packaging (via pip)
