Say I keep my containers as light weight as possible, perhaps using alpine or
some other light weight distro.
When something goes wrong in a pod, it can be difficult to exec in and debug
sometimes because there are no debugging tools in the container.
It would be awesome if you could temporarily attach a new sidecar container to
the specified pod for debugging purposes.
something like:  
kubectl exec -it mypod -s mydebugcont /bin/bash
It could even perhaps take a -c flag and attach to the same pid namespace of
the specified container so stuff like running strace -p would work.
