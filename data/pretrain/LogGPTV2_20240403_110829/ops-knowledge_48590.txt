User: How to use Git for version control and be able to restore the historical version when needed?
Assistant: The steps to use Git for version control are as follows: 1. Create a Git repository locally: use the command `git init` to create a new Git project in the folder that needs to be version controlled; 2. Add files to the Git repository: use the command `git add` Add files that need version control to the Git warehouse; 3. Submit files to the Git warehouse: use the command `git commit` to submit the added files to the Git warehouse; 4. View historical versions: use the command` git log` View all submitted historical versions; 5. Restore to a certain historical version: Use the command `git reset` to point the HEAD pointer of the warehouse to the historical version that needs to be restored. For example, to revert to the previous commit version, you can use the following command: ``` git log --oneline # List all submitted historical versions git reset HEAD~1 # Point HEAD to the previous (HEAD~1) commit version of git checkout . # After reverting to a version, use this command to discard uncommitted changes ```
