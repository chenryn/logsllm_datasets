## Abstract
Smartphone users are increasingly using apps as "gateways" to internet services rather than traditional web browsers. App marketplaces for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone platforms have made it attractive for developers to deploy apps and easy for users to discover and start using many network-enabled apps quickly. For example, the iOS AppStore has over 350,000 apps and more than 10 billion downloads. The emergence of tablets and other mobile devices with different form factors, which also use these marketplaces, has increased the diversity in apps and their user population. Despite the increasing importance of apps as gateways to network services, our understanding of how, where, and when they are used is much sparser compared to traditional web services, particularly at scale.

This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting results on app usage at a national level using anonymized network measurements from a tier-1 cellular carrier in the U.S. We identify traffic from distinct marketplace apps based on HTTP signatures and present aggregate results on their spatial and temporal prevalence, locality, and correlation.

## 1. Introduction
The number and popularity of mobile apps are rising dramatically due to the accelerating adoption of smartphones. For example, Android has 150,000 apps and 350,000 daily activations. Popular smartphone platforms like iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile come pre-installed with marketplace portals such as the AppStore, Market, and Marketplace, making it easy for users to discover and start using many network-enabled apps quickly. By January 22, 2011, more than 350,000 apps were available on the AppStore, with over 10 billion downloads. The emergence of tablets and other mobile devices with different form factors, which also use these marketplaces, has further diversified the app landscape and user base. The existence of marketplaces and platform APIs has also made it more attractive for developers to implement apps rather than complete web-based services.

Despite the increasing importance of apps as gateways to network services, our understanding of how, where, and when they are used is much sparser compared to traditional web services, particularly at scale. This paper takes a first step in addressing this knowledge gap.

A previous study found substantial diversity in the way different people use smartphone apps. However, the study was limited to two platforms and fewer than three hundred users in a few geographic areas. Other studies of mobile application usage have been similarly limited in scope, making it difficult to extrapolate results to make representative conclusions about spatial locality, temporal variation, and correlation of apps at scale. While there have been studies of smartphone performance at larger scales, measuring the usage of different apps from these data sources is challenging. Volunteer measurements are typically obtained by deploying a measurement tool via an app marketplace, but many popular platform APIs do not permit the measurement of other apps in the background. Network data may contain information that can identify app behaviors, but this information is not typically part of standard traces. To make representative conclusions about apps, we require a network data set that identifies apps in network traffic and contains a significant number of measurements covering a representative number of devices, users, locations, and times.

In this study, we address these limitations by collecting anonymized IP-level networking traces in a large tier-1 cellular network in the U.S. for one week in August 2010. We use signatures based on HTTP headers (included in the IP-level trace) to distinguish traffic from different apps. This technique allows us to gather statistics about each individual app in a marketplace, not just categories of network traffic characterized by port number. Our work examines the spatial and temporal prevalence, locality, and correlation of apps at a national scale, not just in one area or over a small population of users.

To our best knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the diverse usage behaviors of individual mobile apps at scale. In this study, we make the following five contributions:
- **Diverse Data Set:** The data set we use to study mobile apps is significantly more geographically and demographically diverse than previous studies, covering hundreds of thousands of smartphones throughout the U.S. in a tier-1 cellular network. This allows us to make more generalizable conclusions about smartphone usage patterns.
- **Local Apps:** We find that a considerable number of popular apps (20%) are local, particularly radio and news apps. These apps account for 2% of the traffic in the smartphone apps category, suggesting significant potential for content optimization in access networks like LTE and WiFi, where content can be placed on servers closer to clients. This also suggests that network operators need to understand the impact of different app mixes in different geographical areas to optimize their network for user experience.
- **Similarities Across Apps:** Despite the diversity in locality, we find similarities across apps in terms of geographic coverage, diurnal usage patterns, etc. Some apps have a high likelihood of co-occurrence on smartphones, suggesting that some apps can be treated as a "bundle" when optimizing for user experience and that there may be opportunities for integration.
- **Diurnal Patterns:** The diurnal patterns of different genres of apps can be remarkably different. For example, news apps are more frequently used in the early morning, while sports apps are more frequently used in the evening. These findings suggest that cloud platforms hosting mobile application servers can leverage distinct usage patterns in classes of apps to maximize resource utilization. Network operators may also optimize their network for different apps during different times of the day.
- **Mobility Patterns:** Mobility patterns can be inferred from network access patterns. Some apps are more frequently used when users are moving around, while others are used more often when users are stationary. Bandwidth-sensitive apps that are mobile may need to consider techniques to compensate for bandwidth variability. We find a significant degree of diversity in the mobility of apps.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 describes our data set, Section 4 presents our measurement results, Section 5 outlines some implications, and Section 6 concludes our study.

## 2. Related Work
Numerous studies have focused on understanding smartphone apps from various perspectives. Studies of smartphone usage have yielded insights into different entities in the mobile computing community, such as content providers, network providers, OS vendors, and mobile app designers. Understanding the usage of mobile apps is critical for content providers to generate, optimize, and deliver content, for network providers to allocate radio resources, for OS vendors to support on-device apps, and for app designers to implement efficient programs. Overall, our study is the first to address the lack of sufficient knowledge about how, where, and when mobile apps are used at a national scale.

Some studies have attempted to improve the performance of mobile apps via OS infrastructure support, such as offloading resource-intensive computation to the cloud, providing clean intermediate interfaces for apps by the OS, and signaling mobile devices by network providers via notification channels to save resources. Our study complements these by focusing on profiling the usage patterns of mobile apps. The design of supportive infrastructure would also benefit from the knowledge of mobile app usage patterns.

Other studies have proposed measurement tools for smartphone devices, characterizing either device performance or the performance of certain apps. Compared to these studies, we focus on usage patterns of mobile apps rather than their performance, but our work also has implications for resource consumption.

Studies have also proposed creative mobile apps to enhance user experience under mobility, such as enabling friendly, efficient, and secure phone sharing on existing mobile phones and leading a user to the vicinity of a desired person in a public place. Although mobile apps are fixed in our study, our work provides app designers with measurements and directions that can help them improve design decisions.

In addition to app usage, app selection has been explored in context-aware mobile app recommendation systems. A key requirement for an app recommendation system is to identify users who share similar app interests so that it can predict apps of interest. Understanding patterns in user interests is also part of our study.

On a large scale, there have been studies characterizing mobile traffic and user interactive behaviors with smartphones. Compared to these studies, our study (1) relies on a data set that can represent the majority of smartphone users across the U.S., (2) covers the impact of multiple factors such as location, time, device, and user, and (3) places more emphasis on the usage of smartphones rather than traffic flows, content type, and WiFi usage.

We believe that our study makes an important step in addressing the lack of knowledge about the usage behaviors of mobile apps.

## 3. Overview of Data Set

### 3.1 Data Set
In this paper, we use an anonymized data set from a tier-1 cellular network provider in the U.S. collected during the week of August 24th, 2010, to August 30th, 2010. The data set contains flow-level information about IP flows carried in PDP Context tunnels (i.e., all data traffic sent to and from cellular devices). This data set is collected from all links between SGSNs and GGSNs in the tier-1 network’s UMTS core network, providing a nationwide view of cellular data traffic. Due to volume constraints, only traffic from a uniform random sample of devices is collected. For a random sample of devices, the data includes the following information for each IP flow per minute: start and end timestamps, per-flow traffic volume in terms of bytes and packets, device identifier, and app identifier. All device and subscriber identifiers (e.g., IMSI, IMEI) are anonymized to protect privacy without affecting the usefulness of our analysis. Furthermore, the data sets do not permit reversing the anonymization or re-identification of subscribers.

App identifiers include information about the application protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS, SIP) and class (e.g., streaming audio, streaming video, web, email). Given that popular smartphone platforms include the app's name in the User-Agent field when the app uses the standard API to access URL network resources, marketplace apps can be identified by the User-Agent field in HTTP headers. We focus on these apps in this paper and classify them into the smartphone apps category. Note that the browser and YouTube are not included in smartphone apps since they come with the smartphone OS and are not present in the marketplace.

We further categorize smartphone apps by the genre listed in their platform's marketplace. To find the category, we use the API provided by each smartphone platform's market to search for the app name presented in the HTTP User-Agent. While the API typically returns multiple results, we manually validated the top apps to ensure the correctness. Table 1 shows the validation results of the querying. Upon the response of each query, we label the result as right, wrong, or unknown. According to Table 1, we are confident in the correctness of the top first result for the majority of the smartphone apps.

In this paper, we are concerned with four main features per app: traffic volume, access time, unique subscribers, and locations. We estimate traffic volume as the sum of the flow byte counts, access time as the sum of the flow durations (with a precision of seconds), and the number of unique subscribers as the number of distinct anonymous device identifiers. There is only one anonymized identifier per distinct device. To determine the location of each device at the time a flow is in progress, we use the cell sector identified in the PDP context used to tunnel the flow. This cell sector is typically recorded when the PDP context begins, when a device moves far enough that the SGSN its traffic routes through changes, switches from 2G to 3G (or vice versa), or switches from 3G to WiFi. While this sector may be slightly stale, previous work showed that they are still almost always accurate to within 40 kilometers. Thus, they suffice for most of our results that only look at U.S. states as distinct regions. For other results, we may underestimate the number of changes due to this limitation.

In total, the sample data set includes approximately 600,000 distinct subscribers and approximately 22,000 distinct smartphone apps.

### 3.2 Limitations
Our approach to identifying apps using the HTTP User-Agent field may miss traffic that does not use the standard platform URL API. However, in Section 3.3, we show that this approach captures a large fraction of traffic that is not email, web browsing, streaming, or a marketplace download (which we identify separately based on other well-known heuristics). Obviously, our data set will not capture app usage except when there are network flows. This is acceptable for our study, as we are primarily interested in apps that are gateways to internet services, not apps that do not use the network.

Another limitation is the time difference when we use these August User-Agent fields generated from the trace during the week of August 24th, 2010, to August 30th, 2010, and query them on the current marketplace. Because developers may change the User-Agent field in updating their apps, this may result in inaccuracies in smartphone app identification. However, according to Table 1, this effect should be small.

### 3.3 Traffic Summary
Figure 1 shows a summary of all traffic in our data set. Devices 1, 2, 3, and 4 are four major device types in this tier-1 network.

- **Figure 1(a):** Distribution of traffic volume. We observe that the volume of known smartphone apps traffic is comparable to the traffic volume of web browsing and other HTTP traffic, which is a major motivation for our study. Moreover, the market category also contributes to considerable traffic, indicating a high demand for smartphone apps from subscribers.
- **Figure 1(b):** Distribution of access time of app categories. It is interesting to note that the streaming category accounts for only a small fraction of the total network access time of all smartphone apps. The gaming, p2p, and voip categories include mostly port and header-identified traffic for common desktop apps. We see that they have a small fraction of both traffic volume and access time, meaning these apps are not common on devices on this cellular network.
- **Figure 1(c):** Distribution of the number of unique subscribers. In this figure, the misc category includes DNS requests, so the misc category roughly has the same number of subscribers as the total number of subscribers observed in the data set. The smartphone apps and web browsing categories cover almost all the subscribers.

For the remainder of this paper, we only examine traffic in the smartphone apps category.
