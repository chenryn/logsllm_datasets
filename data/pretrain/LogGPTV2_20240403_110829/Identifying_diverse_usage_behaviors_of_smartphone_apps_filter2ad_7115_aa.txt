ABSTRACT
Smartphone users are increasingly shifting to using apps as “gate-
ways” to Internet services rather than traditional web browsers.
App marketplaces for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone platforms
have made it attractive for developers to deploy apps and easy for
users to discover and start using many network-enabled apps quickly.
For example, it was recently reported that the iOS AppStore has
more than 350K apps and more than 10 billion downloads. Fur-
thermore, the appearance of tablets and mobile devices with other
form factors, which also use these marketplaces, has increased the
diversity in apps and their user population. Despite the increas-
ing importance of apps as gateways to network services, we have a
much sparser understanding of how, where, and when they are used
compared to traditional web services, particularly at scale. This pa-
per takes a ﬁrst step in addressing this knowledge gap by presenting
results on app usage at a national level using anonymized network
measurements from a tier-1 cellular carrier in the U.S. We identify
trafﬁc from distinct marketplace apps based on HTTP signatures
and present aggregate results on their spatial and temporal preva-
lence, locality, and correlation.

INTRODUCTION
The number and popularity of mobile apps is rising dramatically
due to the accelerating rate of adoption of smartphones. For exam-
ple, Android has 150K apps and 350K daily activations [12]. Pre-
installed with marketplace portals such as the AppStore on iOS,
Market on Android, and MarketPlace on Windows Mobile, popu-
lar smartphone platforms have made it easy for users to discover
and start using many network-enabled apps quickly. By Jan 22,
2011, more than 350K apps are available on the AppStore with
downloads of more than 10 billion [1]. Furthermore, the appear-
ance of tablets and mobile devices with other form factors, which
also use these marketplaces, has increased the diversity in apps and
their user population. The existence of marketplaces and platform
APIs have also made it more attractive for some developers to im-
plement apps rather than complete web-based services. Despite the
increasing importance of apps as gateways to network services, we
have a much sparser understanding of how, where, and when they
are used compared to traditional web services, particularly at scale.
This paper takes a ﬁrst step in addressing this knowledge gap.
A previous study found evidence that there is substantial diver-
sity in the way that different people use smartphone apps [7]. How-
ever, because the study relied on volunteers using instrumented
phones, it was limited to two platforms and less than three hun-
dred users in a few geographic areas. Other studies of mobile
application/app usage [11, 18, 22] have been similarly limited in
scope. Thus, it is difﬁcult to extrapolate these results to make rep-
resentative conclusions about spatial locality, temporal variation,
and correlation of apps at scale. For example, “where are apps
more popular?”, “How is their usage distributed across a country?”,
“How does their usage vary throughout the day?”. While there
have been studies of smartphone performance at larger scales [14,
2, 10], which use volunteer measurements or network data to ob-
tain measurements at scale, measuring the usage of different apps
from these data sources is more challenging. Volunteer measure-
ments are typically obtained by deploying a measurement tool via
an app marketplace, but many popular platform APIs do not permit
the measurement of other apps in the background, so it is difﬁcult
to write an app that captures this information. Network data may
contain information that can identify app behaviors, but this infor-
mation is not typically part of standard traces. To make represen-
tative conclusions about apps, we require a network data set that
identiﬁes apps in network trafﬁc and contains a signiﬁcant num-
ber of measurements covering a representative number of devices,
users, locations, and times.
In this study, we address the limitations by collecting anonymized
IP-level networking traces in a large tier-1 cellular network in the
329U.S. for one week in August 2010. In contrast to previous work,
we use signatures based on HTTP headers (included in the IP-level
trace) to distinguish the trafﬁc from different apps. Due to the for-
mat of User-Agent in HTTP headers when mobile apps use stan-
dard platform APIs, this technique gives us the ability to gather
statistics about each individual app in a marketplace, not just cate-
gories of network trafﬁc characterized by port number. Moreover,
our work examines the spatial and temporal prevalence, locality,
and correlation of apps at a national scale, not just in one area or
over a small population of users.
To our best knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst to investigate the
diverse usage behaviors of individual mobile apps at scale. In this
study, we make the following ﬁve contributions:
• The data set that we use to study mobile apps is signiﬁ-
cantly more diverse geographically and in user base than
previous studies. It covers hundreds of thousands of smart-
phones throughout the U.S. in a tier-1 cellular network. This
allows us to make more generalizable conclusions about smart-
phone usage patterns.
• We ﬁnd that a considerable number of popular apps (20%)
are local, in particular, radio and news apps. In terms of traf-
ﬁc volume, these apps are accountable for 2% of the trafﬁc in
the smartphone apps category (i.e., all the marketplace apps
that can be identiﬁed by User-Agent) – that is, their user
base is limited to a few U.S. states. This suggests signiﬁcant
potential for content optimization in such access networks as
LTE and WiFi where content can be placed on servers closer
to clients. Furthermore, it suggests that network operators
need to understand the impact of different app mixes in dif-
ferent geographical areas to best optimize their network for
user experience.
• Despite this diversity in locality, we also ﬁnd that there are
similarities across apps in terms of geographic coverage, di-
urnal usage patterns, etc. For example, we ﬁnd that some
apps have a high likelihood of co-occurrence on smartphones
– that is, when a user uses one app, he or she is also likely
to use another one. Users also use several alternatives for the
same type of app (e.g., multiple news apps). These ﬁndings
suggest that some apps can be treated as a “bundle” when try-
ing to optimize for their user experience and that there may
be opportunities for integration.
• We also ﬁnd that the diurnal patterns of different genres of
apps can be remarkably different. For example, news apps
are much more frequently used in the early morning, sports
apps are more frequently used in the evening, while other
apps have diurnal patterns less visible and their usage is more
ﬂat during a day. These ﬁndings suggest that cloud platforms
that host mobile application servers can leverage distinct us-
age patterns in classes of apps to maximize the utilization
of their resources. Furthermore, network operators may be
able to leverage these results by optimizing their network for
different apps during different times of the day.
• Mobility patterns can be inferred from network access pat-
terns. Some apps are more frequently used when users are
moving around; some of them are used more often when
users are stationary. Mobility affects connectivity and perfor-
mance, so bandwidth sensitive apps that are mobile may need
to consider techniques to compensate for bandwidth variabil-
ity. We ﬁnd that there is a signiﬁcant degree of diversity in
the mobility of apps.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Related work is
discussed in §2, §3 describes our data set, §4 presents our mea-
surement results, §5 outlines some implications, and we conclude
our study in §6.
2. RELATED WORK
A plethora of studies focus on understanding smartphone apps
from different perspectives. Among them, studies of smartphone
usage have yielded insights into different entities in the mobile
computing community, e.g., content providers, network providers,
OS vendors, mobile app designers, etc. Accordingly, understanding
the usage of mobile apps is critical for content providers to gener-
ate, optimize, and deliver content, for network providers to allocate
radio resources, for OS vendors to support on-device apps, for app
designers to implement efﬁcient programs, etc. Overall, our study
is the ﬁrst that attempts to address the lack of sufﬁcient knowledge
about how, where, and when mobile apps are used at a national
scale.
A group of studies attempted to improve the performance of mo-
bile apps via OS infrastructure support [5, 13, 10, 6], e.g., ofﬂoad-
ing resource intensive computation to cloud [5], providing clean
intermediate interface for apps by the OS [13], and signaling mo-
bile devices by network providers via notiﬁcation channel to save
resource [10]. Our study is complementary to these, as it focuses on
proﬁling the usage patterns of mobile apps; we note that the design
of supportive infrastructure would also beneﬁt from the knowledge
of mobile app usage patterns.
Also related are studies that proposed measurement tools for
smartphone devices characterizing either the device performance or
the performance of certain apps [14, 30, 21], e.g., 3GTest [14] mea-
sures the network performance of popular smartphone platforms,
PowerTutor [30] proﬁles energy consumption of running apps on
Android, ARO [21] characterizes the radio resource usage of mo-
bile apps, etc. Compared to these studies, we focus on usage pat-
terns of mobile apps rather than their performance, but our work
also has implications on resource consumption.
Studies have also proposed creative mobile apps to enhance user
experience under mobility [17, 4, 3, 16], e.g., xShare [17] enabling
friendly, efﬁcient, and secure phone sharing on existing mobile
phones, Escort [4] leading a user to the vicinity of a desired person
in a public place, etc. Although mobile apps are ﬁxed in our study,
our work provides app designers with measurements and directions
that can help them improve design decisions.
Besides app usage, app selection has been explored as well in
context-aware mobile apps recommendation systems [26, 29]. A
key requirement for an app recommendation system is to identify
the users who share certain similar app interests so that it can pre-
dict apps of interest. Understanding patterns in user interests is also
part of our study.
On a large scale, there have been studies characterizing the mo-
bile trafﬁc [11, 18, 8, 15] and user interactive behaviors with smart-
phones [7, 22, 23]. Compared to these studies, our study (1) relies
on a data set that can represent the majority of smartphone users
across the U.S.; (2) covers the impact of more than one factor, e.g.,
location, time, device, user, etc.; (3) places more emphasis on the
usage of smartphones rather than trafﬁc ﬂows, content type, and
WiFi usage.
We believe that our study makes an important step in addressing
the lack of knowledge of usage behaviors of mobile apps.

3. OVERVIEW OF DATA SET
3.1 Data Set
In this paper, we use an anonymized data set from a tier-1 cel-
lular network provider in the U.S. It is collected during the week
of August 24th, 2010 – August 30th, 2010. The data set contains
ﬂow-level information about IP ﬂows carried in PDP Context tun-
nels (i.e., all data trafﬁc sent to and from cellular devices). This
data set is collected from all links between SGSNs and GGSNs in
tier-1 network’s UMTS core network. Hence, we have a nation-
wide view of cellular data trafﬁc. Due to volume constraints, only
trafﬁc from a uniform random sample of devices is collected. For a
random sample of devices, the data contains the following informa-
tion for each IP ﬂow per minute: the start and the end timestamps,
per-ﬂow trafﬁc volume in terms of both the bytes and the number of
packets, the device identiﬁer, and the app identiﬁer. All device and
subscriber identiﬁers (e.g., IMSI, IMEI) are anonymized to protect
privacy without affecting the usefulness of our analysis. Further-
more, the data sets do not permit reversing the anonymization or
re-identiﬁcation of subscribers.
App identiﬁers include information about application protocol
(e.g., HTTP, DNS, and SIP) and class (e.g., streaming audio, stream-
ing video, web, email). Moreover, given that these popular smart-
phone platforms include the app’s name in the User-Agent ﬁeld
when the app uses the standard API to access URL network re-
sources, the marketplace apps can be identiﬁed by the User-Agent
ﬁeld in HTTP headers. We focus on these apps in this paper and
we classify them into the smartphone apps category. Note that the
browser and YouTube are not included in smartphone apps since
they come with the smartphone OS and are not present in the mar-
ketplace.
We further categorize smartphone apps by the genre that it is
listed under in its platform’s marketplace. To ﬁnd the category,
we use the API provided by each smartphone platform’s market
to search for the app name presented in the HTTP User-Agent.
While the API typically returns multiple results that match the query
(by treating it as a wild card), we manually validated the top apps
whether the top ﬁrst result is correct. Table 1 shows the correspond-
ing validation results of the querying. Upon the response of each
query, we have three attitudes: right, wrong, and unknown. We
consider a response as right or wrong only if we are conﬁdent on
the correctness. For example, we believe that a User-Agent con-
taining Pandora is a music app and another User-Agent including
Facebook is not a sport app. There are some apps that are very hard
to tell by us according to their User-Agent ﬁelds such as WSDU 4,
which we label as unknown. Additionally, those queries whose re-
sponses are empty are labeled as unknown. According to Table 1,
we are conﬁdent on the correctness of the top ﬁrst result for the
majority of the smartphone apps.
In this paper, we are concerned about four main features per app:
trafﬁc volume, access time, unique subscribers, and locations.
We estimate trafﬁc volume as the sum of the ﬂow byte counts, ac-
cess time as the sum of the ﬂow durations (with a precision of sec-
onds), and the number of unique subscribers as the number of dis-
tinct anonymous device identiﬁers. There is only one anonymized
identiﬁer per distinct device. To determine the location of each
device at the time a ﬂow is in progress, we use the cell sector iden-
tiﬁed in the PDP context used to tunnel the ﬂow. This cell sector
is typically recorded when the PDP context begins, when a device
moves far enough that the SGSN its trafﬁc routes through changes,
switches from 2G to 3G (or vice versa), or switches from 3G to
WiFi. While this sector may be slightly stale, previous work [27]
showed that they are still almost always accurate to within 40 kilo-
meters. Thus, they sufﬁce for most of our results that only look
at U.S. states as distinct regions. For other results we present on
sector changes, we may underestimate the number of changes due
to this limitation.
In total, the sample data set includes approximately 600K dis-
tinct subscribers and approximately 22K distinct smartphone apps.
3.2 Limitation
Our approach to identifying apps using the HTTP User-Agent
ﬁeld may miss trafﬁc that does not use the standard platform URL
API. However, in Section 3.3 we show that this approach captures a
large fraction of trafﬁc that is not email, web browsing, streaming,
or a marketplace download (which we identify separately based on
other well known heuristics). Obviously, our data set will not cap-
ture app usage except when there are network ﬂows. This is accept-
able for our study, since we are primarily interested in apps that are
gateways to Internet services, not apps that do not use the network.
Another limitation is the time difference when we use these Au-
gust User-Agent ﬁelds generated from the trace during the week of
August 24th, 2010 – August 30th, 2010, and query them on the cur-
rent marketplace. Because developers may change the User-Agent
ﬁeld in updating their apps, this may result inaccuracy of smart-
phone app identiﬁcation. However, according to Table 1, this effect
should be small.
3.3 Trafﬁc Summary
Figure 1 shows a summary of all trafﬁc in our data set. Devices
1, 2, 3, and 4 are four major device types in this tier-1 network.
Figure 1(a) shows the distribution of trafﬁc volume. We observe
that the volume of known smartphone apps trafﬁc is comparable
with the trafﬁc volume of web browsing and other HTTP trafﬁc,
which is a major motivation for our study. Moreover, the market
category also contributes to considerable trafﬁc, which indicates a
high demand for smartphone apps from subscribers.
Figure 1(b) shows the distribution of access time of app cate-
gories. It is interesting to note that the streaming category is only
accountable for a small fraction of the total network access time of
all smartphone apps. The gaming, p2p, and voip categories include
mostly port and header-identiﬁed trafﬁc for common desktop apps.
We see that they have a small fraction of both trafﬁc volume and ac-
cess time, which means that these apps are not common on devices
on this cellular network. Figure 1(c) shows the distribution of num-
ber of unique subscribers. In this ﬁgure, the misc category includes
DNS requests, so the misc category roughly has the same number
of subscribers as total number of subscribers that we observed in
the data set. The smartphone apps and web browsing categories
cover almost all the subscribers.
For the remainder of this paper, we only examine trafﬁc in the
smartphone apps category.
