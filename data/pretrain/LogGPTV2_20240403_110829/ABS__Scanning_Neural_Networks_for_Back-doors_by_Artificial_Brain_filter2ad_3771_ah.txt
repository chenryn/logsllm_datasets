neered using one compromised neuron. ABS may report multiple
compromised neurons for a trojaned model. We randomly select
one. Row 3 shows the triggers reverse engineered using all com-
promised neurons together. To use all compromised neurons, we
change f1 in Algorithm 2 to the be sum of the activations of all
compromised neurons. As shown in Figure 26, the triggers reverse
engineered by multiple neurons are not better than those reverse

while both kinds of triggers have very high REASR. This supports
our design choice of using one neuron.

Appendix G SENSITIVITY OF PARAMETERS
IN ABS
· SSIM(x, x
· f1 + w3
w1
· sum(mask) − w4
w1
In this section, we evaluate the sensitivity of weight parameters
w1, w2, w3 and w4 in Algorithm 2, where the function cost can be
re-written as follows:
′))
cost = w1(·f2 − w2
w1
Note that w1 is a common parameter for all entries in cost. Thus
we can focus on tuning w2, w3 and w4 to show the sensitivity
of parameters in ABS. Recall that w3 is the parameter for pixel
space triggers and w4 is the parameter for feature space triggers.
Hence we perturb w2 and w3 for pixel space attacks, and w2 and
w4 for feature space attacks. We perturbed these parameters on the
trojaned NiN models at a scale of 10. The default value of w2 is 1e-4
and we try different values of w2 ranging from 1e-6 to 1e-2. The
default value of w3 is 50 and we try different values from 0.5 to
500. The default value of w4 is 10 and hence we try the values from
0.1 to 1000. In Table 11, row 1 shows the different parameters, row
2 shows the different values of parameters and row 3 shows the
average REASR for the trojaned NiN models. Observe that changing
w2 and w3 does not significantly impact REASR. For w4, ABS is
effective from 0.1 to 10, but has degraded performance beyond 10.
