tries with few resolvers could also inﬂuence these results.
§5.3 investigates these factors further.
Figure 5 shows the representation of responses in our
dataset by country. For example, the leftmost pair of bars
shows that, while less than 5% of all responses in our
dataset came from Iranian resolvers, the responses that
we received accounted for nearly 40% of manipulated re-
sponses in the dataset. Similarly, Chinese resolvers rep-
resented 1% of responses in the data but contributed to
15% of the manipulated responses. In contrast, 30% of
our DNS responses came from resolvers in the United
States, but accounted for only 5% of censored responses.

are seemingly arbitrary; they host no services, not even
a fundamental webpage. The 10 most frequent Chinese
responses constituted almost 75% of Chinese responses.
The remaining 25% are spread over a long tail of nearly
1,000 seemingly arbitrary non-Chinese IP addresses.
5.3 Manipulation Within Countries
Figure 7 shows the DNS manipulation of each domain by
the fraction of resolvers within a country, for the 10 coun-
tries with the most normalized amount of manipulation.
Each point represents a domain; the vertical axis repre-
sents the fraction of resolvers in that country that manip-
ulate it. Shading shows the density of points for that part
of the distribution. The plot reveals several interesting
phenomena. One group of domains is manipulated by
about 80% of resolvers in Iran, and another group is ma-
nipulated by fewer than 10% of resolvers. This second
group of domains is manipulated by a smaller fraction of
resolvers, also returning non-public IP addresses. These
effects are consistent with previously noted blackholing
employed by DNS manipulation infrastructure [7]; this
phenomenon deserves further investigation.
Similarly, one set of domains in China experiences
manipulation by approximately 80% of resolvers, and
another set experiences manipulation only half the time.
In contrast, manipulation in Greece and Kuwait is more
homogeneous across resolvers.

responses, by the IP address that appears in the manipu-
lated answer. The top two special-purpose (i.e., private)
IP addresses appear in the majority of responses within
Iran. The third most common response is an OpenDNS
(a DNS ﬁltering and security product [13]) blockpage
indicating adult content. The fourth most frequent re-
sponse is an IP address hosting an HTTP error page
known to be used in Turkey DNS manipulation [11].
Private and special-purpose IPv4 addresses in ma-
nipulated DNS responses. Of the roughly 42,000 ma-
nipulated DNS responses, 17,806 correspond to special-
purpose IPv4 addresses as deﬁned by RFC 6890 [17]; the
remaining 23,972 responses corresponded to addresses
in the public IP address space. Table 8 shows the ex-
tent to which countries return private IP addresses in
responses, for the top 10 countries ranked by the rela-
tive amount of DNS manipulation compared to the total
number of results from that country. For example, we
observed more manipulated responses from Turkey than
Iraq, but Iris used more open DNS resolvers in Turkey,
so observed frequencies require normalization. Here, we
notice that countries that manipulate DNS tend to either
return only special-purpose IP addresses in manipulated
responses (as in the case of Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait) or
only public IP addresses (China).
Figure 6 presents the distribution of observed pub-
lic IP addresses across manipulated responses in our
dataset. The most frequently returned public IP address,
an OpenDNS blockpage, constituted almost 15% of all
manipulated responses containing public IP addresses.
The top ten public IP addresses accounted for nearly 60%
of responses.
Many IP answers have been observed in previous stud-
ies on Chinese DNS censorship [5, 25]. These addresses

The horizontal axis is sorted by the most common IP.
Heterogeneity across a country may suggest a situa-
tion where different ISPs implement ﬁltering with differ-
ent block lists; it might also indicate variability across
geographic region within a country. The fact that ma-
nipulation rates vary even among resolvers in a certain
group within a country may indicate either probabilistic
manipulation, or the injection of manipulated responses
(a phenomenon that has been documented before [5]).
Other more benign explanations exist, such as corporate
ﬁrewalls (which are common in the United States), or lo-
calized manipulation by resolver operators.
Ceilings on the percent of resolvers within a country
performing manipulation, such as no domain in China
experiencing manipulation across more than approxi-
mately 85% of resolvers, suggest IP geolocation errors
are common.

5.4 Commonly Manipulated Domains
Commonly manipulated domains across countries.
Many domains experienced manipulation across a range
of countries. Figure 8 shows a CDF of the number of
countries (or dependent territories) for which at least
one resolver manipulated each domain. 30% of domains
were manipulated in only a single country, while 70%
were manipulated in 5 or fewer countries. No domain
was manipulated in more than 19 countries.
Table 9 highlights domains that experience manipula-
tion in many countries (or dependent territories). The 2
most manipulated domains are both gambling websites,
each experiencing censorship across 19 different coun-
tries. DNS resolutions for pornographic websites are
similarly manipulated, accounting for the next 3 most
commonly affected domains. Peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing

sites are also commonly targeted, particularly The Pi-
rate Bay. The Tor Project [50] DNS domain is the most
widely interfered with domain amongst anonymity and
censorship tools, manipulated across 12 countries. Cit-
izen Lab [15] also experienced manipulation across 4
countries. We note that www.google.com is impacted
across more countries than google.com, unsurprising
since all HTTP and HTTPS queries to google.com im-
mediately redirect to www.google.com; for example,
China manipulates www.google.com queries but disre-
gards those for google.com. This result underscores
the need for domain datasets that contain complete do-
mains and subdomains, rather than simply second-level
domains.
We also note that commonly measured sites such as
The Tor Project, Google, and Twitter, experience ma-
nipulation across signiﬁcantly fewer countries than some
sites. Such disparity points to the need for a diverse do-
main dataset.
China focuses its DNS manipulation not just on adult
content but also major English news outlets, such as
nytimes.com, online.wsj.com, and www.reuters.
com. China is the only country observed to manipulate
the DNS responses for these domains; it also censored
the Chinese language Wikipedia domain.
