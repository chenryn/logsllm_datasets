### Analysis of Device Identification and MAC Address Allocation

#### 1. Introduction
This section provides an in-depth analysis of device identification and MAC address allocation, focusing on the use of mDNS, WPS fields, and OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) fragmentation. We collected over 222 million data frames, with approximately 45% being encrypted. Non-mDNS and encrypted frames were excluded per our IRB agreement.

#### 2. Data Collection and Analysis
- **mDNS Packets**: 32% of mDNS packets contain the `dns.txt` field, allowing us to identify models of 9,849 Apple, 184 BlackBerry, and 417 Android devices.
- **Apple Devices**: Apple is the most prevalent client (approximately 44%) and the third most prevalent AP (approximately 7%) manufacturer that does not implement WPS. This was determined using the OUI for management frames without WPS data.
- **Locally Assigned MAC Addresses**: Over 166 million frames (8%) used locally assigned MAC addresses, primarily for P2P and privacy reasons. Using UUID-E identifiers, we identified seven distinct manufacturers: Motorola (502), Huawei (460), Samsung (259), Sony (91), HTC (71), Blackberry (36), and MediaTek (25).

#### 3. Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot Devices
- **Wi-Fi Direct Enabled Devices**: We observed 5,182 unique Wi-Fi Direct enabled devices, with 2,176 dual-enabled for Wi-Fi Display. The majority of these devices are Roku streaming media players (2,260) and Amazon Fire TV (148).
- **iPad and iPhone Hotspots**: 2,609 unique iPad and iPhone devices operated as hotspots. We calculated their global MAC addresses using the technique described in §3.2.1, observing two distinct offset values: 0x02 or 0x22 in the first byte of the MAC address.

#### 4. MAC Address Allocation
- **General Observations**: There is no general pattern in MAC address allocation among manufacturers. Some assign the entire OUI to one model, while others assign smaller ranges to multiple models.
- **OUI Fragmentation**: We found 2,956 unique OUIs, with approximately 5,000 OUI-to-manufacturer pairings and 10,000 OUI-to-model pairings. This highlights the value of fine-grained inference. For example, Apple products are confined within their allocated OUI space, with 352 distinct Apple OUIs and 1,028 unique OUI-to-model pairs.

#### 5. Visualization of MAC Address Allocation
- **Graphical Representation**: To visualize MAC address allocation, we plotted occurrences of observed devices with a given OUI in different colors by model on an x-y plane. The y-axis corresponds to the fourth byte of the MAC, and the x-axis to the fifth byte. Gradients between sample points indicate the density of MAC addresses.
- **Confidence Levels**: Intense-colored portions indicate high confidence in the inferred intervals, while white sections indicate lower confidence. Unobserved or uninferrable spaces appear black.

#### 6. Examples of MAC Address Allocation
- **Apple (OUI 24:A2:E1)**: This OUI contains four models: two versions of the iPad Mini 2, the iPhone 5c, and a 13” MacBook Pro. The largest part of the OUI is dedicated to the iPhone 5c, with 52% of the OUI.
- **LG Electronics (OUI 8C:3A:E3)**: This OUI includes twenty-one distinct smartphone models. Inference spans only 9% of the OUI, with large continuous blocks rarely observed.
- **Cisco (OUI C0:C1:C0)**: This OUI has 17 AP models, with 248 distinct contiguous ranges. The Linksys E1000 appears most frequently, with 54 distinct ranges.
- **Shanghai Huaqin (OUI 90:21:81)**: This OUI includes seven distinct manufacturers and twelve device models, highlighting the complexity of address allocation policies.
- **Sercomm Corp. (OUI 00:0E:8F)**: This OUI is registered to Sercomm Corp. and includes APs, a wireless repeater, and five types of 802.11-enabled cameras.
- **Wistron Neweb (OUI 48:A9:D2)**: This OUI includes Sharp and Panasonic Viera televisions, and a large contiguous block allocated to Audi vehicle WiFi systems.

#### 7. Validation on CRAWDAD Sapienza Data
- **Validation Process**: We validated our technique against a third-party corpus of publicly available probe requests from Sapienza, consisting of approximately 11 million probes from 160,000 unique devices.
- **Results**: Our inferences correctly predicted the correct manufacturer and model for 1,419 out of 1,746 addresses, achieving an 81.3% accuracy. Incorrect predictions were often due to rare or unobserved devices in our dataset.

#### 8. Conclusion
Our analysis provides a detailed understanding of MAC address allocation and device identification, highlighting the importance of fine-grained inference and the complexities involved in MAC address allocation across different manufacturers.
