responding manufacturer WPS ﬁeld (the manufacturer of
the chipset) and a PC device type. Similarly, Roku devices
advertise as APs rather than multimedia devices.
We collect over 222M data frames, of which ∼45% are
encrypted. We ignore non-mDNS and encrypted frames per
our IRB agreement. 32% of the mDNS packets contain the
dns.txt ﬁeld, allowing us to identify the models of 9,849
Apple, 184 BlackBerry, and 417 Android devices.
Tables 5 and 6 reveal that Apple is the most prevalent
client (∼44%) and third most prevalent AP (∼7%) man-
ufacturer that does not implement WPS. We obtain the
non-WPS statistics simply based on the OUI [13] for the
set of management frames where no WPS data is included.
We therefore use mDNS features to characterize Apple and
other devices that do not use WPS.
Locally assigned MAC addresses are observed in over 166M
frames (8%). Because locally assigned MAC addresses are
used for P2P and privacy reasons (§3.2.1), it is diﬃcult to as-
certain exactly how many distinct devices transmitted these
frames. Instead, we ﬁrst consider devices using randomized
local MACs that include a WPS UUID-E. From UUID-E
identiﬁers that we can reverse using pre-computed tables,
we ﬁnd that the majority fall into seven distinct manufac-
turers: Motorola (502), Huawei (460), Samsung (259), Sony
(91), HTC (71), Blackberry (36), and MediaTek (25). The
Figure 1: CDF of OUI Fragmentation
most commonly observed models are the Motorola Nexus 6
(490), Huawei 6P (460), HTC Nexus 9 (71), Sony Xperia
Z5 (69), Samsung S5 (38), BlackBerry Priv (36), and the
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (26).
Next, we inspect the WPS ﬁelds among P2P frames. We
observe 5,182 unique WiFi-Direct enabled devices, with 2,176
of those dual enabled for WiFi-Display. The majority of
these devices are various Roku streaming media players (2,260)
and Amazon Fire TV (148). A variety of HP, Samsung, and
Epson printer models span 1,659 devices, with 302 Vizio and
282 Sony Bravia televisions.
Last, we observe 2,609 unique iPad and iPhone devices
operating as hotspots. We calculate their global MAC using
the technique described in §3.2.1. Two distinct bins for the
oﬀset values are present: an oﬀset of either 0x02 or 0x22 in
the ﬁrst byte of the MAC address.
4.2 MAC Address Allocation
We next seek to characterize MAC allocation strategies
employed in practice. There is no general pattern between
manufacturers; some assign the entire OUI to only one model,
while others assign smaller ranges to dozens of distinct mod-
els. The size and number of distinct ranges assigned to a
model also follows no general rule. We highlight several ex-
emplar manufacturers here.
We observe 2,956 unique OUIs. Inspection of the WPS
data reveals that the 2,956 OUI contain ∼5,000 OUI to man-
ufacturer pairings, and ∼10,000 OUI-model. This increase
in pairings results from cases where the OUI is owned by the
chipset manufacturer, further highlighting the value of ﬁne-
grained inference. Using mDNS, we see only Apple products
within the OUI space allocated to Apple. We observe 352
distinct Apple OUIs and 1,028 unique OUI to model pairs.
In order to visualize MAC address allocation within an
OUI, we plot occurrences of observed devices with a given
OUI in diﬀerent colors by model on an x-y plane, where the
y-axis corresponds with the fourth byte of the MAC, and
the x-axis with the ﬁfth byte. To highlight the density of
the MAC addresses we observe, we alter the gradient be-
tween each pair of sample points, such that the midpoint
between two observed MAC addresses has minimum alpha
value. We normalize the gradients to the largest distance
between any two MAC addresses with the same model in-
formation; in this way, the largest distance between any two
MAC addresses will appear white, indicating the lowest den-
sity of observation. This coloring also provides a visual in-
dication of conﬁdence in the inferred intervals – the most
intense-colored portions indicate regions in which we have
82
Figure 2: Observed Models in 24:A2:E1 (Apple)
the highest conﬁdence that these ranges of the OUI space
will be of that particular model; conversely, in the whitest
section of a contiguous block of MAC address to model ob-
servations, we have relatively lower conﬁdence that a MAC
address observed will correspond to the same model. Space
within the OUI for which we have no observations or infer-
ences based on a series of MAC addresses associated with
the same model appear black.
In general, we ﬁnd that MAC address allocation is non-
random across vendors and OUIs. To quantify the amount
of randomness present in model assignment of MAC ad-
dresses, we calculate the amount of “fragmentation” present
in each OUI (Figure 1). We calculate fragmentation as fol-
lows: ﬁrst, we ﬁnd the number of MAC address triplets in
lexicographical order in which the ﬁrst and third MAC ad-
dress correspond to the same model, while the second MAC
is not. We then divide this count by the total number of
triplets. Very little fragmentation appears in our database
– approximately 80% of WPS and Apple mDNS OUIs have
no fragmented MAC address-model triplets.
4.2.1 Example: Apple
Our ﬁrst example is Apple’s 24:A2:E1 OUI which con-
tains four models: two models of the iPad Mini 2 (cellular
and WiFi-only versions), the iPhone 5c, and a 13” MacBook
Pro. Figure 2 graphically displays our inferred ranges for
these models within the OUI, with black intervals indicat-
ing portions with no observations. All OUI plots in this work
(like Figure 2) are in color should be viewed with color.
Based on the start and end of each contiguous block of
MAC address observations, we infer that the largest part of
the OUI is dedicated to the iPhone 5c, with a block con-
sisting of over 8.7 million MAC addresses (52% of the OUI).
The 3.06M MAC addresses allocated to the WiFi version
of the iPad Mini 2 are spread among a contiguous block of
3.03M addresses and a much smaller block of 31K addresses
in a diﬀerent portion of the OUI. ∼2.4M addresses are al-
located to the cellular version of the iPad Mini 2, and a
small range (∼50K) is devoted to the “MacBookPro 9,2” (a
mid-2012 13” laptop).
Interestingly, the iPad Mini 2 and
iPhone 5c were released in late 2013, over a year after the
release of this MacBook Pro, illustrating that allocations
evolve over time. Based on the MAC address-model pairs
Figure 3: Observed Models in 8C:3A:E3 (LGE)
Figure 4: CDFs of Inferred Block Sizes for WPS-Using
Manufacturers and Apple
in our database, we ﬁnd that we can make no inference for
∼15% of the 24:A2:E1 OUI, indicated by the black portions
of Figure 2.
4.2.2 Example: LG Electronics
In stark contrast to our inferred allocation of the Apple
OUI is the 8C:3A:E3 OUI, registered to LG Electronics. LG
manufactures many 802.11-enabled devices; in this partic-
ular OUI we observe twenty-one distinct models of smart-
phones. Our inference of the MAC address ranges indicated
spans only 9% of the OUI – large continuous blocks of models
are rarely observed; those that do, span only several bytes
in the fourth byte of the MAC address. Many observed
data points alternate models of smartphone, thereby allow-
ing us to make no inference beyond a single 256-MAC ad-
dress pixel as to ranges assigned to particular models. For
instance, the LGL39C, a prepaid device sold by Tracfone,
appears four times in our database, but never without an-
other model of phone between two data points. We therefore
are conﬁdent only in the particular ﬁve-byte point in which
the LGL39C appears.
It bears noting that some OUI of
LG phones contain multiple models within the same 256-
MAC address, ﬁve-byte pixel as well, implying that some
manufacturers allocate multiple devices within a single ﬁve-
byte range of MAC addresses. Such micro-allocations sig-
83
Figure 5: CDF of Number of Blocks per OUI (all
manufacturers)
Figure 6: Observed Models in C0:C1:C0 (Cisco)
niﬁcantly increase the diﬃculty for a passive observer to
accurately infer the ranges of MAC addresses assigned to
individual models. In general, we observe more ﬁne-grained
MAC address ranges for manufacturers using WPS (like LG)
than we do for Apple, from whom we gather model informa-
tion through mDNS. Figure 4 illustrates the relative diﬀer-
ence in inferred block sizes, comparing all 58 Apple OUIs for
which we have data against the top 58 OUIs in which we de-
rive model-level detail from WPS. In Figure 5, we plot the
distribution of number of inferred blocks per OUI. While
∼60% of OUIs have only one inferred block, a nontrivial
percentage (∼10%) have 20 or more.
4.2.3 Example: Cisco
Allocations of contiguous blocks to distinct device mod-
els are present among AP manufacturers as well. Figure 6
shows the inferred allocation of the C0:C1:C0 OUI owned by
Cisco, with 17 models of APs. Visually, our plot indicates
that assignment of addresses is performed more granularly
by Cisco than Apple. As opposed to the ﬁve distinct blocks
in §4.2.1, we ﬁnd 248 distinct contiguous ranges dispersed
throughout the OUI. The Linksys E1000 appears most fre-
quently, with 54 distinct ranges of addresses that transmit
management packets with WPS. Further, the blocks associ-
ated with the E1000 also make up the largest allocation to
any single device (2.4M addresses). Two devices appear in
84
Figure 7: Observed Models in 90:21:81 (Shanghai Huaqin)
a single x-y grid square – the Cisco E100t, a network card,
and Linksys E2100L, a wireless router, giving these two de-
vices the smallest inferred ranges within the OUI. Overall,
we infer that about 60% of the OUI has been allocated, with
a mean of∼41K addresses per block.
4.2.4 Example: Spanning OUIs
To highlight the complexity and diversity of address allo-
cation policies, we present two interesting examples: manu-
facturers that split MAC address ranges assigned to a single
model across multiple OUIs, and OUI that contain devices
produced by multiple manufacturers.
To illustrate the assignment of the same device model
throughout the ranges of several OUI, we examine another
Apple-owned OUI that contains iPhone 5c devices, as in
§4.2.1. The 224 addresses in 0C:3E:9F are split between the
GSM versions of the iPhone 5c and 5s, with 33% and 53%
of the OUI respectively allocated to each.
iPhone 5c GSM
devices are found in ten Apple OUIs; including the global
variant, twelve OUIs contain some version of the iPhone
5c. This model is by no means unique in its distribution
across multiple OUIs – our collection has discovered iPhone
6 Plus devices in three OUIs – nor is allocating a single
device to several OUIs unique to Apple. For example, we
observe Huawei’s Nexus 6P in nine distinct OUIs. We spec-
ulate that the rationale behind dividing a single device to
multiple OUIs may be one of eﬃciency (that is, maximiz-
ing utilization of previously-purchased OUI space) or possi-
bly indicative of a logical assignment of an OUI to discrete
manufacturing locations.
Further, we present an illuminating counterexample to the
conventional wisdom that an OUI is suﬃcient to identify the
manufacturer of the device. Figure 7 is a visualization of the
90:21:81 OUI where we observe seven distinct manufactur-
ers: Acer, Archos, BLU Mobile, i-Mobile, LAVA, Micro-
max, and Oplus with twenty-eight address ranges assigned
to twelve device models. Because we have been able to in-
fer address blocks for only ∼23% of the OUI, it is likely
that more models and manufacturers occupy the OUI space.
This ﬁnding is likely attributable to the OUI owner (Shang-
hai Huaqin Telecom) producing 802.11 chipsets for many
Figure 8: Observed Models in 00:0E:8F (Sercomm Corp.)
manufacturers of low-cost devices. Whereas ﬁngerprinting
of devices based on the OUI would identify a single man-
ufacturer, our technique ﬁnds granular discrete ranges for
unique manufacturers and models within this OUI.
4.2.5 Example: IoT
We also apply our OUI allocation inference to IoT devices.
Figure 8 highlights an interesting result, the 00:0E:8F OUI
registered to Sercomm Corp. While portions of the OUI
are allocated for APs, we observe a wireless repeater (ZTE
H560N) and ﬁve types of 802.11-enabled cameras, the Sen-
sormatic OC810, OC821D, RC8025, and RC8021 models,
and iCamera 1000. The iCamera, in particular, appears
121 times in twenty-seven discrete blocks. We note that a
thief conducting wireless reconnaissance of a potential target
could easily determine whether or not one of these cameras
was present using our ﬁne-grained ﬁngerprinting.
Next, we show two use cases where using identiﬁers passed
through WPS or mDNS can be augmented with other, more
commonly used methods of ﬁngerprinting devices. Figure 9
shows the 48:A9:D2 OUI of Wistron Neweb Corp. Evalua-
tion of the byte allocation using WPS reveals four devices,
one Sharp and three Panasonic Vierra televisions; there are
no results from the analysis of mDNS in this OUI. To more
thoroughly evaluate the allocation structure, we augment
our analysis by manually inspecting beacon frames from de-
vices in this OUI. We ﬁnd a common and consistent SSID
syntax used by Audi vehicle WiFi systems. Furthermore,
a large contiguous block is allocated to such vehicle-based
WiFi systems.
These results highlight several observations; i) the ability
to ﬁngerprint diverse IoT device allocations; ii) structure
can be augmented with inspection of common SSIDs; and
therefore iii) multiple methods of identifying byte allocation
structure exist and are complimentary.
4.3 Validation on CRAWDAD Sapienza Data
To evaluate our technique, we validate against a third-
party corpus of publicly available probe requests in CRAW-
DAD from Sapienza [6]. This dataset consists of approxi-
mately 11M probes requests on behalf of 160,000 unique de-
Figure 9: Observed Models in 48:A9:D2 (Wistron Neweb)
vices. The Sapienza CRAWDAD corpus diﬀers from ours in
the location and time period during which it was obtained
– our data is primarily from the Eastern Seaboard of the
United States from 2015-2016, while the Sapienza data is
from three months in 2013 throughout Italy.
The Sapienza corpus has anonymized the 802.11 probe
MAC addresses, SSIDs, and other identiﬁers. To obtain de-
vice MAC addresses, we therefore take the subset of probe
requests containing WPS ﬁelds that have both a distinguish-
ing manufacturer and model ﬁeld, as well as a UUID-E that
we can invert using the technique described in [27]1. Of
the 2,674 unique UUID-Es, we map 1,832 back to the true
global MAC addresses. Finally, we remove 86 addresses
with only “SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS” as the manufac-
turer and “SAMSUNG MOBILE” as the model, as they pro-
vide no detail on the precise model or device. Thus, we per-
form validation on a test set of 1,746 real MAC addresses
from 63 distinct OUIs with corresponding manufacturer and
model labels from the WPS probe advertisements.
We use the technique of §3.3 to query for each of the
MAC addresses in the Sapienza corpus, and compare our
inferred manufacturer and model against the manufacturer
and model in the corpus’ WPS frame. We ﬁnd that our infer-
ences correctly predict the correct manufacturer and model
for 1,419 of the 1,746 addresses, an 81.3% accuracy.
We make three observations regarding the ∼19% of in-
correct predictions. First, our database returns no results
(that is, cannot match at least the ﬁrst three bytes of the
queried MAC) only four times. Three of these database
“misses” are attributable to Samsung Galaxy Tab tablets,
a device that we have observed in the wild infrequently.
The fourth is a mobile phone sold in Korea, the Pantech
Vega R3 (IM-A850K), which we have not observed in our
corpus. Similarly, other devices that we mispredict are ob-
served rarely in our collection, or not at all. For example,
the mobile phone manufacturer Pulid appears twice in our
dataset, but in diﬀerent OUIs from the Pulid phone present
1We have notiﬁed the corpus authors of the requirement to
also anonymize UUID-E.

in the Sapienza dataset, while we never observe the manu-
facturer “Jiayu.” Finally, many of the incorrect predictions
are, in fact, temporally “close,” meaning that the release
date of the device closely matches our prediction. For in-
stance, the Sapienza corpus contains a large number of Sam-
sung Galaxy S III smartphones under various carrier-deﬁned
model names (e.g., GT-I9300). While our system correctly
guesses the model for the majority of Samsung Galaxy S III
devices, the most common incorrect predict is a variant of
the Samsung Galaxy Note II. Given that these two phones
were released three months apart, and that the Galaxy Note
II is based on the hardware design of the Galaxy S III, even
this incorrect inference provides useful context about the
device.
