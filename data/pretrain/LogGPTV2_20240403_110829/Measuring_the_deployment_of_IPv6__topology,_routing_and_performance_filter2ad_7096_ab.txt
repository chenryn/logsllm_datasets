the 14-year dataset described above to obtain a new classi-
ﬁcation. Of the ASes present in both datasets, only 2.4%
had a diﬀerent classiﬁcation. We assume that an AS has the
same business type in IPv6 as in IPv4. We further classify
ASes according to their primary geographical region of oper-
ation, as reﬂected in the RIR database (WHOIS) where the
AS is registered: ARIN (North America), RIPE (Europe,
Middle East, and the former USSR), APNIC (Asia/Paciﬁc),
AfriNIC (Africa), and LACNIC (Latin America).
Performance data
Similar to the method employed by Nikkhah et al. [16], we
measure the average time to fetch a page from webservers
registered in the DNS with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that
have the same origin AS number in the longest matching
BGP route. We use the Alexa list of the one-million most
popular websites in the Internet, testing up to three web-
servers for each origin AS. We try to avoid a common prob-

lem with throughput measurements, namely never getting
out of TCP’s slow start phase, by seeking to download a
page that is at least 10,000 bytes. If the web site’s root page
is smaller than that, we fetch the smallest object embedded
in that page that is at least 10,000 bytes2. While a thresh-
old of 10,000 bytes is not always suﬃcient to get out of slow
start, it seeks to balance the tradeoﬀ between ﬁnding a large
number of web objects to download, and ensuring that those
objects are suﬃciently large. We fetch each page three times
from each webserver, alternating IPv4 and IPv6 transport
sequentially. Each measurement begins approximately ﬁve
seconds after the previous one completes to avoid competing
measurements but also to minimize the chance of network
topology changes mid-measurement. We also measure the
forward AS-level IPv4 and IPv6 paths using traceroute with
TCP probes immediately after the sequence of performance
measurements completes. We collected this data from ﬁve
vantage points: a state network in New York; a research
network in Japan; a commercial ISP in Japan; a commercial
network in the Netherlands; and an enterprise customer in
the Netherlands. We sanitized our measurements as in [16]:
We excluded from performance evaluation those measure-
ments where the standard error of the mean download time
(for either IPv4 or IPv6) was greater than 10% (at the 95%
signiﬁcance level), or the object sizes in IPv4 and IPv6 were
not within 1% of each other. This ﬁltering left us with 544
dual-stack ASes represented in our dataset, consisting of 233
ECs, 106 STPs, 10 LTPs, and 195 CAHPs according to the
previously described classiﬁcation. We used scamper’s tbit
and traceroute implementations [17]; the former includes a
test that fetches a page, negotiating TCP SACK and TCP
timestamps, and records all packets sent and received dur-
ing the test, which allows us to further examine the packet
traces to infer why performance may diﬀer.
3. GROWTH TRENDS BY BUSINESS TYPE
AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION
While overall growth rates indicate that IPv6 deployment
is accelerating, these growth rates diﬀer by (business) type
of network and geographic region. Since IPv6 provides es-
sentially the same functionality as IPv4, we hypothesize that
as IPv6 matures, the distribution of business types in IPv6
should resemble that in IPv4. Geographic coverage of IPv6
may not exhibit the same convergence with IPv4 given the
pre-existing allocation of IPv4 address space around the
world and various levels of pressure by diﬀerent national
governments to promote IPv6.
3.1 Growth trends by business type
Figure 2 shows the fraction of networks over time from
each of the four business types mentioned in Section 2, for
the IPv4 (top panel) and IPv6 (bottom panel) topologies.
Above each panel, we show the total number of ASes in
the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs over which the fractions are com-
puted. At least since 1998 (when historical BGP data be-
came available), the IPv4 topology has always consisted of
a large fraction of EC networks; currently 90% of ASes are
EC, while STPs and CAHPs comprise most of the remaining
10%. In 2003 only 35% of IPv6 networks were of type EC,
but this fraction has increased steadily, currently at 60%.
The relatively large fractions of STPs and CAHPs in the

Figure 2: As IPv6 matures the fraction of EC ASes
has grown from 35% to over 60% of the IPv6 graph,
while IPv4 has seen little change, with ECs currently
at 90%.
IPv6 topology suggests that IPv6 deployment has primarily
occurred at the core of the network, driven by transit and
content providers.
To further explore the evolution of business types in IPv6,
we measure growth trends for each AS type in the IPv4 and
IPv6 graphs. We ﬁnd that ECs, STPs and CAHPs all grow
linearly in IPv4 after 2001. The IPv6 graph has evolved dif-
ferently. For ECs, STPs, and CAHPs, we ﬁnd that an initial
linear growth phase from 2003 (when data archiving began)
until 2007-2008, followed by exponential growth until the
present time gives the best ﬁt with the data. The exponents
for ECs, STPs, and CAHPs in the exponential growth phase
are 0.16, 0.09, and 0.08, respectively.3
We also measure the growth rate (in ASes/month) of each
business type in the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs (graph omitted
due to space constraints). In both the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs,
ECs show the highest growth rate, although the growth rate
of ECs in the IPv4 graph (between 50 and 350 ASes/month
over the last 14 years) has always been larger than in the
IPv6 graph. Only since 2011 has the EC growth rate in
IPv6 been comparable to that in the IPv4 graph. In fact,
the growth rate of ECs in the IPv6 graph reached a peak of
182 ASes/month in mid-2011 and then declined, coincident
with World IPv6 Day [18] in June 2011, and consistent with
Aben’s observation that the overall growth rate of IPv6 ASes
peaked around the World IPv6 day [19]. The growth rate of
STP and CAHP ASes in IPv4 has been almost constant over
the last 14 years (between -2 and 20 ASes/month); interest-
ingly, the growth rates for these types in the IPv6 graph are
similar (between -2 and 40 ASes/month), and since 2010,
the growth rates in IPv6 are larger than those in IPv4 (in
fact, STPs and CAHPs show recent negative growth in the
IPv4 graph). The recent spurt in the growth rate of IPv6
ECs to a level that is comparable with the growth rate of
IPv4 ECs is encouraging: it implies that IPv6 deployment at
the edges, which has historically lagged behind deployment
at the core, is now catching up.

RIPE overtook ARIN in the IPv4 graph in 2009;
RIPE has always been ahead in IPv6.
3.2 Growth trends by geographical region
Figure 3 shows the number of ASes in diﬀerent geograph-
ical regions over time, according to the RIR WHOIS map-
pings described in Section 2. We omit the two smallest reg-
istries (LACNIC and AfriNIC), which have so few ASes com-
pared to the three large registries (ARIN, RIPE and APNIC)
that they are barely visible in the graph. The graph shows
that for IPv4, the growth rate of RIPE-registered ASes has
exceeded that of ARIN-registered ASes for the last decade
(though both ARIN and RIPE showed linear growth in this
period), and as of 2009 the RIPE region has more ASes
than the ARIN region, a big diﬀerence from the early days
of IPv4. For the IPv6 graph, on the other hand, the growth
trend for each of the ARIN, RIPE and APNIC registries
shows two distinct periods since 2003 – an initial linear phase
followed by an exponential phase (with exponents 0.13, 0.13
and 0.11, respectively) until the present time. For ARIN
and RIPE, the change from linear to exponential happened
around 2007-2008, while for APNIC it was at the start of
2009. Unlike IPv4, however, the RIPE region has always
had more ASes in IPv6 than ARIN. APNIC had more ASes
than ARIN until 2008, when the IPv6 AS growth rate in
the ARIN region changed to exponential. While the RIPE
and APNIC regions led early adoption of IPv6, adoption in
the ARIN region is accelerating, and the number of ARIN-
registered and RIPE-registered ASes in IPv6 currently grow
at the same rates.
The business type classiﬁcation of the previous section re-
veals more insight into growth across diﬀerent geographic
regions. Although growth in ECs in diﬀerent regions mostly
follows the same trends as for all ASes (shown in Figure 3),
STPs and CAHPs behave diﬀerently. In the IPv4 graph, the
growth rate of ARIN-registered STPs was almost identical
to that of RIPE-registered STPs (around 5 ASes/month)
until 2002. Since 2002, however, the growth rate of ARIN-
registered STPs has slowed to 1.5 ASes/month, while that
of RIPE-registered STPs is around 3 ASes/month. Con-
sequently, the number of RIPE-registered STPs soon sur-
passed ARIN-registered STPs. This diﬀerence may derive
from contrasting regulatory environments which led to more
competition in the transit market in Europe than in North
America. Another possible explanation is the tendency of
small Eastern European networks to use Provider-Indepen-
dent (PI) address space [20] which is typically advertised in
BGP with its own ASN, rather than Provider-Aggregatable
