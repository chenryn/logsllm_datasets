### Dataset and Classification

We utilized a 14-year dataset to obtain a new classification. Among the Autonomous Systems (ASes) present in both datasets, only 2.4% had a different classification. We assume that an AS has the same business type in IPv6 as in IPv4. Additionally, we classify ASes based on their primary geographical region of operation, as reflected in the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) database (WHOIS), where the AS is registered: ARIN (North America), RIPE (Europe, Middle East, and the former USSR), APNIC (Asia/Pacific), AfriNIC (Africa), and LACNIC (Latin America).

### Performance Data

Similar to the method employed by Nikkhah et al. [16], we measured the average time to fetch a page from web servers registered in the DNS with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, which have the same origin AS number in the longest matching BGP route. We used the Alexa list of the one million most popular websites, testing up to three web servers for each origin AS. To avoid common throughput measurement issues, such as not getting out of TCP’s slow start phase, we sought to download pages that are at least 10,000 bytes. If the root page was smaller than this, we fetched the smallest embedded object that met the size requirement. While a threshold of 10,000 bytes is not always sufficient to exit the slow start phase, it balances the need to find a large number of web objects and ensure they are sufficiently large.

Each page was fetched three times from each web server, alternating between IPv4 and IPv6 transport sequentially. Each measurement began approximately five seconds after the previous one completed to avoid competing measurements and minimize the chance of network topology changes during the test. We also measured the forward AS-level IPv4 and IPv6 paths using traceroute with TCP probes immediately after the performance measurements. This data was collected from five vantage points: a state network in New York, a research network in Japan, a commercial ISP in Japan, a commercial network in the Netherlands, and an enterprise customer in the Netherlands.

We sanitized our measurements as in [16]: we excluded measurements where the standard error of the mean download time (for either IPv4 or IPv6) was greater than 10% (at the 95% significance level), or the object sizes in IPv4 and IPv6 were not within 1% of each other. After filtering, we were left with 544 dual-stack ASes in our dataset, consisting of 233 End-Customer (EC) networks, 106 Small Transit Providers (STPs), 10 Large Transit Providers (LTPs), and 195 Content and Access Hosting Providers (CAHPs) according to the previously described classification. We used scamper’s tbit and traceroute implementations [17]; the former includes a test that fetches a page, negotiating TCP SACK and TCP timestamps, and records all packets sent and received during the test, allowing us to further examine packet traces to infer why performance may differ.

### Growth Trends by Business Type and Geographic Region

While overall growth rates indicate that IPv6 deployment is accelerating, these growth rates differ by the type of network and geographic region. Since IPv6 provides essentially the same functionality as IPv4, we hypothesize that as IPv6 matures, the distribution of business types in IPv6 should resemble that in IPv4. However, geographic coverage of IPv6 may not exhibit the same convergence with IPv4 due to the pre-existing allocation of IPv4 address space and varying levels of government pressure to promote IPv6.

#### Growth Trends by Business Type

Figure 2 shows the fraction of networks over time from each of the four business types mentioned in Section 2, for the IPv4 (top panel) and IPv6 (bottom panel) topologies. Above each panel, we show the total number of ASes in the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs over which the fractions are computed. Since 1998, when historical BGP data became available, the IPv4 topology has consistently consisted of a large fraction of EC networks; currently, 90% of ASes are EC, while STPs and CAHPs comprise most of the remaining 10%. In 2003, only 35% of IPv6 networks were of type EC, but this fraction has increased steadily, currently at 60%.

The relatively large fractions of STPs and CAHPs in the IPv6 topology suggest that IPv6 deployment has primarily occurred at the core of the network, driven by transit and content providers.

To further explore the evolution of business types in IPv6, we measured growth trends for each AS type in the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs. We found that ECs, STPs, and CAHPs all grow linearly in IPv4 after 2001. The IPv6 graph has evolved differently. For ECs, STPs, and CAHPs, we found that an initial linear growth phase from 2003 (when data archiving began) until 2007-2008, followed by exponential growth until the present time, gives the best fit with the data. The exponents for ECs, STPs, and CAHPs in the exponential growth phase are 0.16, 0.09, and 0.08, respectively.

We also measured the growth rate (in ASes/month) of each business type in the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs (graph omitted due to space constraints). In both the IPv4 and IPv6 graphs, ECs show the highest growth rate, although the growth rate of ECs in the IPv4 graph (between 50 and 350 ASes/month over the last 14 years) has always been larger than in the IPv6 graph. Only since 2011 has the EC growth rate in IPv6 been comparable to that in the IPv4 graph. In fact, the growth rate of ECs in the IPv6 graph reached a peak of 182 ASes/month in mid-2011 and then declined, coinciding with World IPv6 Day [18] in June 2011, and consistent with Aben’s observation that the overall growth rate of IPv6 ASes peaked around the World IPv6 day [19]. The growth rate of STP and CAHP ASes in IPv4 has been almost constant over the last 14 years (between -2 and 20 ASes/month); interestingly, the growth rates for these types in the IPv6 graph are similar (between -2 and 40 ASes/month), and since 2010, the growth rates in IPv6 are larger than those in IPv4 (in fact, STPs and CAHPs show recent negative growth in the IPv4 graph). The recent spurt in the growth rate of IPv6 ECs to a level that is comparable with the growth rate of IPv4 ECs is encouraging: it implies that IPv6 deployment at the edges, which has historically lagged behind deployment at the core, is now catching up.

#### Growth Trends by Geographical Region

Figure 3 shows the number of ASes in different geographical regions over time, according to the RIR WHOIS mappings described in Section 2. We omit the two smallest registries (LACNIC and AfriNIC), which have so few ASes compared to the three large registries (ARIN, RIPE, and APNIC) that they are barely visible in the graph. The graph shows that for IPv4, the growth rate of RIPE-registered ASes has exceeded that of ARIN-registered ASes for the last decade (though both ARIN and RIPE showed linear growth in this period), and as of 2009, the RIPE region has more ASes than the ARIN region, a significant difference from the early days of IPv4. For the IPv6 graph, on the other hand, the growth trend for each of the ARIN, RIPE, and APNIC registries shows two distinct periods since 2003 – an initial linear phase followed by an exponential phase (with exponents 0.13, 0.13, and 0.11, respectively) until the present time. For ARIN and RIPE, the change from linear to exponential happened around 2007-2008, while for APNIC, it was at the start of 2009. Unlike IPv4, however, the RIPE region has always had more ASes in IPv6 than ARIN. APNIC had more ASes than ARIN until 2008, when the IPv6 AS growth rate in the ARIN region changed to exponential. While the RIPE and APNIC regions led early adoption of IPv6, adoption in the ARIN region is accelerating, and the number of ARIN-registered and RIPE-registered ASes in IPv6 currently grow at the same rates.

The business type classification of the previous section reveals more insight into growth across different geographic regions. Although growth in ECs in different regions mostly follows the same trends as for all ASes (shown in Figure 3), STPs and CAHPs behave differently. In the IPv4 graph, the growth rate of ARIN-registered STPs was almost identical to that of RIPE-registered STPs (around 5 ASes/month) until 2002. Since 2002, however, the growth rate of ARIN-registered STPs has slowed to 1.5 ASes/month, while that of RIPE-registered STPs is around 3 ASes/month. Consequently, the number of RIPE-registered STPs soon surpassed ARIN-registered STPs. This difference may derive from contrasting regulatory environments, which led to more competition in the transit market in Europe than in North America. Another possible explanation is the tendency of small Eastern European networks to use Provider-Independent (PI) address space [20], which is typically advertised in BGP with its own ASN, rather than Provider-Aggregatable (PA) address space.

### BGP Vantage Points

Table 1 lists the BGP vantage points (VPs) providing both IPv4 and IPv6 routing data since 2003. Six of the seven networks are transit providers, which may bias our view of the topology because we miss peering links below them.
