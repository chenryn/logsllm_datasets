User:  Suppose we are using a Kubernetes cluster to manage a containerized application. Please analyze the existing problems and propose optimization strategies based on the following Node resource usage. Node resource usage:\nCPU: 70% usage\nMemory: 80% usage\nStorage: 50% usage\nAssistant: Existing problems: 1. High CPU and memory usage may affect the performance and stability of the application. 2. Storage usage is moderate, but likely to grow in the future. Optimization strategy: 1. Check and optimize the resource requirements of the application, such as adjusting container resource limits, etc., to reduce CPU and memory usage. 2. Adjust the number and size of nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to increase available resources. 3. Consider using specific resource scheduling strategies, such as PodAntiAffinity, etc., to avoid scheduling Pods that use similar resources on the same node. 4. Regularly review storage usage and optimize storage strategies, such as using distributed storage solutions, to cope with future storage demand growth.
