In order to define bean using factory method from other than bean class itself
requires currently using of a registered factory bean. Registered factory bean
feels quite useless when implementing factory method pattern. In worst case
bean count duplicates if bean name of factory bean has to be generated on the
fly.
MethodInvokingFactoryBean (with help of MethodInvoker) allows static class as
prefix of factory method name and can therefore be used as registered factory
bean but incorporating of this logic directly to
org.springframework.beans.factory.support.AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.getTypeForFactoryMethod
(and possibly to some other places than I've overlooked) would omit the need
of factory bean altogether in these cases. Using MethodInvoker might also be
beneficial since it already contains logic to handle illegal state scenarios
which would be possible with this addition.
