candidates for installing DRs as they intercept the vast majority of
flows to any destination.
Our results indicate that 30 ASes suffice to provide Decoy Routing
worldwide (in comparison, the state of the art [1] requires over 850
ASes to contain a single adversary country, China).
A possible objection to our method is that several of the “heavy-
hitter” ASes of the Internet [28] may themselves be adversaries, as
they are hosted in censorious nations [29]. However, in this paper,
we show that only a handful of ASes (≈ 30) are needed to host
Decoy Routers, even when we restrict ourselves from using ASes in
adversary countries such as Russia or China.
Moreover, we correct some incorrect assumptions made by the
earlier authors. Houmansadr [1] use customer-cone size as a metric
to choose ASes, assuming that it is a good predictor of how many
flows they carry; we explain in Section 6 (and in the appendix) why
it is not.
Our second, and more important, contribution is to demonstrate
that even though the number of ASes needed for a DR infrastructure
is small, the actual number of routers that are to be replaced with DRs
is large. We map ASes at the router-level, using Rocketfuel [18],
and identify the specific network elements that potentially need
to be replaced by DRs; on average, for each AS we need to deploy
several hundred DRs. We suggest that the cost of such “major
surgery” effectively removes the possibility that ASes would operate
such a project pro bono, and raises the question of how such an
infrastructure may be economically feasible [12].
2.3 Mapping the Internet
Our work depends on finding the paths to a particular destination
taken by Internet traffic. In this sub-section, we give a short intro-
duction to Internet mapping, and explain our method of mapping.
The Internet consists of routers and hosts, organized into net-
works called Autonomous Systems (ASes). These networks operate
independently, but collaborate to route traffic among themselves.
ASes can be customers, peers, or providers to other ASes; besides
FirewallClientto InternetCDODDR StationTagged FlowDRa physical connection, there must be an acceptable business rela-
tionship between two ASes, before they route traffic through each
other.5
Mapping the Internet involves two tasks – Finding inter-AS
connections (and relationships) and mapping routers and hosts
(and their connections, inside ASes).
AS-level mapping.: Projects such as CAIDA Ark [30] and iPlane [31]
map Internet routes with traceroute. Traceroute returns router-
level paths from a source to a destination, hop-by-hop; the map
is built by running traceroute from distributed volunteer nodes to
various /24 prefixes. This data is consolidated into a graph where
the nodes represent ASes, and edges represent links between them.
Such approaches are generally limited by the network locations
and availability of the volunteer nodes; they may not provide the
AS-level path between any two randomly chosen ASes, and even
where they do, they may be inaccurate.
In our research we used the approach of Gao and Qiu [13], that
uses RIBs collected from the Routeviews project [27] and “stitches
together” known links, thus constructing paths to our target sites
from every AS in the Internet. This approach has been used in the
past by others [32, 33]. Details are given in Appendix A.
Router-level mapping: A large AS, such as an ISP, generally has
several thousand routers. In theory, it is possible to repeat our ap-
proach for inter-AS mapping (where we use BGP information), and
map the internal structure of ASes using their SNMP Management
Information Bases (MIBs) [34]. However, we have no access to
this data. Instead, we mapped the routers in ASes of interest using
the Rocketfuel approach [18] (this involves running traceroute
probes from looking glass servers [35] to prefixes inside a chosen
AS). Thereafter, IP aliases6 are resolved using Midar [36].
3 MOTIVATION
The problem in this paper is to determine where in the Internet we
should place DRs, in order to intercept large fraction of network
paths. The current state of the art [1] chooses ASes which are
strongly linked with each target country (therefore intercepting
much of their traffic), and whose customer cone size exceeds some
threshold. However, this approach has the following limitations:
(1) New ASes must be identified for each adversary nation.
(2) This set of ASes is quite large. (over 850 ASes for China,
nearly 850 for Venezuela, etc.)
(3) Customer-cone size does not seem to be an effective metric
for choosing ASes that appear frequently in real routes
(candidates for DR placement)7
(4) A large AS has thousands of routers, spread across several
countries. Current methods identify the ASes to place DRs
in - but not where in the AS they should be placed.
In order to address these limitations, we construct a map of the
Internet, and select the ASes that occur most frequently in our
paths (estimated using real BGP routing tables), instead of any
other metric. Next, we map these ASes to identify their key routers;
5A customer AS routes traffic through its providers; but providers do not route
“through” traffic through their customers. The only traffic a provider sends a cus-
tomer, is meant for that customer, or its customers, and so on.
6Different interfaces of the same router, with different IP addresses, are called IP aliases
7We mention the reasons in Section 6. Details are provided in the Appendix.
this allows us to estimate the number of DRs we need to be able to
intercept a large fraction of Internet traffic.
4 METHODS: DATA COLLECTION AND
ALGORITHM
This section presents our algorithm for identifying key ASes in the
Internet, and key routers in these ASes. Our focus in this section
is on finding ASes and routers that intercept the paths from all
ASes to important destinations (Alexa top-10, top-20 etc.) We also
describe how we verify that our results are more general, i.e. that
our key ASes and routers also intercept paths to other destinations
besides the top-n website. This is covered in more detail in Section
6. Our network mapping process consists of two phases.8
• First, we build an AS-level Internet map, consisting of paths
connecting popular websites and all the ASes of the Inter-
net. We identify ASes that appear most frequently in those
paths as key ASes (for hosting DRs).
• In the second phase, we estimate the router – level topology
of key ASes to identify key routers – the actual routers
inside the ASes that transport the majority of traffic.
4.1 Generating AS level maps
For the first phase of network mapping, we used the approach
presented by Gao et al. [13]. AS paths are collected from BGP paths
at Internet Exchange Points (IXes) [27]. These tables, however, do
not contain paths originating at every AS; Gao et al.’s approach
infers paths originating from every AS, using the existing BGP
paths. ASes are appended to existing paths by selecting those that
most frequently appear adjacent to ASes on the said BGP paths,
without invalidating the path’s valley-free property9. The aim is to
build paths connecting every AS in the Internet to a given IP prefix.
Details of the AS mapping algorithm are presented in Appendix A.
For our analysis, we used snapshots of BGP RIBs collected from
15 vantage points [27]. Our original approach involved choosing
the top-10 most popular sites, finding the paths from all ASes to
their corresponding prefixes, and identifying the most frequently
appearing ASes on these paths.
As presented in Section 5, we found a small set of ASes that
appear in more than 90% of the paths to these popular destinations
from all ASes. We then increased the number of popular destina-
tions – top-10, 30, 50, upto 100 – and estimated the paths to the
corresponding prefixes from all ASes. At each step we identified the
set of ASes which appear most frequently in the paths. As we show
in Section 5, the rough set of ASes remained almost unchanged as
we varied the number of destinations.
These results suggest that the ASes identified were likely “heavy-
hitter” ASes of the Internet, potentially suitable candidates for DRs
placement, as they may intercept a large fraction of network paths,
originating at ASes around the world. As a caveat, we know that
8Our original plan was to map the entire Internet at the router level, and identify
the key routers directly. Unfortunately, no existing techniques scale to mapping the
Internet accurately at such fine granularity.
9The AS-level path between two hosts on the Internet is said to follow a “valley free”
path, as the path first rises - an AS, then its provider, then a provider of the provider,
etc.; peaks - or plateaus, as it crosses through several peering links - and then descends,
through provider-to-customer links, until it reaches the destination. There must be no
no provider-to-customer links between two customer-to-provider links (“valleys”)
the Internet has a hierarchical structure, rooted at a few “core
ASes” which peer with one another and intercept a large fraction
of network routes [2]. But to test this claim, we had to answer two
questions – (a) Was it necessary to select exactly, and all, these
ASes for placing DRs? Some of these ASes were in censorious
countries. (b) How could we validate that our observations, that a
great majority of paths were intercepted by these ASes, were not
limited to the target OD sites we studied?
In order to answer the first question, we investigated the impact
of replacing our key ASes in Russia, China, etc., with the next best
choice: ASes ranked 31-50 by path frequency, but in non-censorious
countries. We found the path coverage remained over 90%.
To answer the second question, we took the key ASes computed
for the top-100 sites (say, Set-A). Next, taking sites ranked 101-200
on Alexa (Set-B), we computed the paths to these sites for all ASes.
We discovered that the key ASes, computed using the paths for Set-A,
continue to intercept over 90% paths for Set-B.
Finally, we also computed the paths corresponding to the 50
most popular websites in each of nine different censorious nations
(say, Set-C). The same key ASes also intercepted over 90% of the
AS-level paths to destinations in Set-C.
Several months after our initial route collection, we repeated our
experiments, and found the same set of key ASes intercepting over
90% of the paths to Set-A, Set-B, and Set-C.
Our approach differs from what was proposed previously [1, 11].
The authors either chose Tier–1 ASes, or those that had large
customer-cone sizes. We show in Section 6, and in the Appen-
dix, that customer-cone size is poorly correlated to the number of
network paths that traverse an AS (path frequency)–the latter being
a better metric to select candidate ASes for DR placement.
We note that Gao et al.’s algorithm generates the request paths
(connecting all ASes to selected IP-prefixes), and not the reply paths
(from the prefixes to the ASes). It is natural to ask whether asymme-
try in routing might impact the strategy for placing DRs. However,
the latest DR architectures, such as TapDance [8], are agnostic to
path symmetricity10. This greatly simplifies the Decoy Router place-
ment problem: we only need to place a DR on the path from the
user to the OD, and not necessarily on the return path.
4.2 Creating router level maps
After identifying key ASes in the Internet, as above, we were still
left with the problem of where in the AS to put DRs. An AS involves
a complex topology of routers and hosts; even the AS administrator,
who knows the internal topology, may not know how frequently
a router appears in actual network paths. When approaching AS
admins to ask them to implement Decoy Routing, it is helpful to
estimate how many (and which) routers they will need to replace.
We therefore identified the actual routers that transport most of
the ASes’ traffic, using Rocketfuel [18] as follows:
• For each chosen AS, we identified the prefixes it adver-
tises (from cidr-report.org). From 390 planetlab nodes,
we targeted Traceroute probes to three representative IP
addresses, corresponding to each prefix; we thus obtain

states, without requiring the DR’s intervention.
router-level paths terminating at these prefixes. To cap-
ture paths transiting the said AS, we also ran traceroute
probes targeted towards IP prefixes in its neighboring ASes.
• Using Whois [37], we inspected each traceroute paths
to identify the first and last IP address belonging to the
target AS. We denote these as the edge routers of an AS (as
opposed to core routers, i.e. the internal routers of the AS).
We trim the traces down to the part between these edge
routers, i.e. inside the AS.
• The router IPs (belonging to the target AS), discovered
through the above process, suffer from problems such as
aliasing [38], so we resolved these aliases using the state-
of-the-art alias resolution tool Midar [36].
• Finally, from the traceroute results we identified a mini-
mum number of routers which cumulatively intercept over
90% of traceroute paths. When possible, we selected edge
routers (as the edge routers cover 100% of paths through
the AS). But in cases where some heavy-hitter edge and
core routers intercept over 90% of paths, and this set is
smaller than the set of edge routers, we selected those (the
former) instead.
5 DATA AND EVALUATIONS
Figure 2: ASes needed to capture 90% of traffic paths to dif-
ferent sets of overt destinations (popular websites).
5.1 Identification of Key ASes
As described in the previous section, we began by selecting a small
set of globally popular websites (Alexa top-10), computed the AS-
level paths to them, and identified ASes which appeared most fre-
quently in these paths. We recomputed such paths by increasing
the number of popular websites – top-30, 50, 70 and 100. As figure 2
shows, the same number of roughly 30 ASes intercepted over 90%
of the paths to these sites.
For instance, in Figure 3, we show the CDF of the 4, 497, 547
paths connecting the Alexa top-100 sites to all ASes, and their
interception by our top-30 ASes. The X-axis represents the top-30
ASes ranked by their path frequencies; the Y-axis represents the
actual fraction of paths. The highest-ranked AS, AS3356 (Level 3
Communications), intercepts 1, 492, 079 paths (33.2% of all paths).
