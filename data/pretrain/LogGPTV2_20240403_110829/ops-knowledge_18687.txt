User: I hi have just ordered a couple of beaglboards for experimenting. I know that it can rub Ubuntu and many other flavors of linux. 
Does that mean it can run all the trivial software that run on Ubuntu? 
Will the python and ruby interpreters work just the way they work on PC ?
Assistant: The Angstrom Linux distribution (which runs on the Beagle Board) has binary packages for both Python and Ruby. I've worked on an application that uses Python and PyGTK. Never had any problems.
