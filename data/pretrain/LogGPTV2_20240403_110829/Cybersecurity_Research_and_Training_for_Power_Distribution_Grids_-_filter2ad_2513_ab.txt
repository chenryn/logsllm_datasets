supervise the grid’s state and behavior, i.e, monitor and manage the grid.
use power flow calculations based on the current topology configu-
ration using pandapower [10] to simulate the power distribution
grid. As shown in Figure 1, a simulated power grid consists of a
connection to an external grid, buses, lines with varying proper-
ties, transformers, switches, circuit breakers, loads and generators,
which can be combined for more complex models.
2.4 Coupling of Network and Grid Simulation
Although network emulation and power grid simulation can oper-
ate independently in theory, they depend on information from each
other. E.g., MTU MA in Figure 1 might issue a command to RTU
RA to change the behavior of the associated transformer TA, thus
requiring that the network emulation can write and read parame-
ters of the simulated power grid. To achieve an actual mapping and
mediation between both simulators, our blueprint relies on simula-
tion coordination (cf. Figure 1) to provide the current power grid
state and measurements to the respective communication network
components, ensure that control commands are implemented by
the power simulation, and trigger the power flow computation.
2.5 Assessing Feasibility and Scalability
To assess the feasibility and scalability of a cybersecurity testbed
for power grids, we present preliminary performance results.
We measure the memory consumption when deploying the full
communication network for the CIGRE [9] MV grid (25 hosts, 22
switches, 46 links) with prototype implementations of its compo-
nents. Our preliminary results show that an RTU requires less than
65 MiB RAM and the whole network requires less than 1.4 GiB.
Representing the MV Oberrhein [10] as a larger and more realistic
network (181 hosts, 179 switches, 361 links) requires less than 8 GiB
RAM, which is feasible even for current desktop systems.
Considering the simulation of the power grid, we investigate the
time required for power flow computation. For the CIGRE MV grid
(cf. Fig. 1) with 15 lines and 59 components this requires on average
7.4 ms. MV Oberrhein, as a realistic and considerably larger grid
with 181 lines and 1588 components, shows an average runtime of
13.2 ms, indicating the general feasibility of our proposed approach.

The interplay of communication network and physical world is a
special property of CPSs, drastically increasing the potential conse-
quences of cyberattacks [4]. Our proposed cybersecurity testbed
enables the flexible investigation of potentially unpredictable phys-
ical effects. We support conducting a variety of attacks (targeting
both, communication network and grid components) against the
simulated environment to observe the behavior of affected compo-
nents. Due to the detailed modeling of the communication network,
including individual interfaces and links as well as switch and host
behavior, various attack scenarios can be reproduced and evaluated.
Ultimately, this provides the potential to reliably assess the likeli-
hood, required effort, and severity of cyberattacks against power
grids, paving the way for developing advanced security measures.
3.2 Generation of Research Data
Sophisticated cybersecurity approaches such as semantic or process-
aware IDSs [13] require extensive datasets of benign and mali-
cious behavior, e.g., to train and validate machine learning models.
Uniquely for CPSs such as power grids, these datasets need to cover
both, network traffic and the corresponding physical state. Our
testbed can cost-efficiently provide such data based on automated
time-series information and execution of attacks (cf. §3.1). Thus,
extensive data on the physical grid state and network traffic can
be collected with the help of virtual interfaces and SPAN ports
provided by each switch. Likewise, after each simulation step, the
physical state of the power grid can be exported, both as is (ground
truth) and as received by the MTU (subject to noise and potential
modification attacks). From a different angle, our testbed also facil-
itates the creation of realistic honeypots which model a complex
CPS, thus allowing for the collection of authentic attack data.
3.3 Evaluation of Cybersecurity Approaches
Qualitative evaluation of cybersecurity approaches requires de-
ploying them in grids of varying complexity and size. Besides sole
deployment, our blueprint allows to evaluate the efficiency, i.e, the
rate of anomaly detection and false alarms, as well as potential
undesired effects on the actual communication and grid infrastruc-
tures. Allowing for fine-tuned attacks (cf. §3.1) as well as flexible
deployment of security approaches, e.g., IDSs such as Snort or Zeek,
further aids in deployment optimization, e.g. IDS sensor placement.
Respective pipelines, e.g., based on the Elastic stack, enable produc-
ing new, replicable, and publishable research data (cf. §3.2), as well
as easing data visualization for evaluating the effects and efficiency
of security concepts, and assisting in cybersecurity training.
3.4 Cybersecurity Teaching & Training
Given the growing threat of cyberattacks, keeping personnel trained
and ready to respond to security incidents is of paramount impor-
tance. Due to deviants in operators’ setups, predefined training
procedures are insufficient, while practicing in live infrastructure
is unreasonable. Our blueprint allows such training by deploying
operator-specific security infrastructure along with generic secu-
rity tools to provide a realistic and familiar environment. Further,
precise orchestration and coordination of cyberattacks within the
training environment is possible by deploying dedicated attack
hosts and modeling both, historic and potential future break-in
scenarios, that entail varying levels of infrastructure access. Hence,
personnel can test and train appropriate handling in case of such
attacks in a dedicated environment. Other potential uses of our
blueprint include cybersecurity teaching for computer science and
electrical engineering students, or hosting capture-the-flag compe-
titions as gamified security training [1]. Hybrid operation covering
real-world components promises valuable insights as well.
4 SUMMARY AND NEXT STEPS
As a foundation to mitigate cybersecurity threats in power distri-
bution grids, we presented a blueprint for a cybersecurity research
and training testbed that allows to couple real network applications
with a simulated power grid. Such a testbed enables various use
cases in cybersecurity research and training, e.g., evaluation of the
physical impact of cyberattacks, generation of datasets for training
machine learning models, and testing of cybersecurity approaches.
Currently, we are working on fully implementing our blueprint
in Python based on Mininet as network emulator and pandapower
as power flow solver. Thereby, we strive to realistically mimic a
European power distribution grid and its communication infrastruc-
ture using the MV Oberrhein grid topology and IEC 60870-5-104 as
communication protocol. Besides realizing the actual testbed, we
are implementing various use cases, ranging from advanced multi-
staged cyberattacks, an IDS (based on Snort, ElasticSearch, and
Kibana), as well as a fully-fledged training environment for tech-
nical personnel. In addition to performing synthetic performance
benchmarks, we plan to validate our testbed against a medium/low
voltage distribution grid with multiple distribution substations op-
erated within a research laboratory at RWTH Aachen University.
