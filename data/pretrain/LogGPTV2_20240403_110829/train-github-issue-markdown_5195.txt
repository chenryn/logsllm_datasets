The issue at #4273 was closed but the problem still exists. There is even a
repo with a repro
### Input Code
    export * from 'module'
### Babel Configuration (.babelrc, package.json, cli command)
    {
        "plugins": [
          "transform-runtime"
        ],
        "presets": [
          "es2015"
        ]
      }
### Expected Behavior
There should be no `import` statement in the output file
### Current Behavior
The file contains
    import _Object$defineProperty from 'babel-runtime/core-js/object/define-property';
    import _Object$keys from 'babel-runtime/core-js/object/keys';
### Possible Solution
A **workaround** is adding the `polyfill: false` in the transform config:
    {
      "presets": ["es2015"],
      "plugins": [
        [
          "transform-runtime",
          { "polyfill": false }
        ]
      ]
    }
But this may not suit all cases
