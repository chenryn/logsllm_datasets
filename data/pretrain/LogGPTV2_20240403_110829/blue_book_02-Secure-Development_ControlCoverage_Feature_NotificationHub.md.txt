### Notification Hub Description and Rationale

| **Control** | **Severity** | **Automated Fix Script** | **Description** |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Notification Hub must be created through Azure Resource Manager (ARM) model** | High | No | The ARM/v2 model should be used to create Notification Hubs, as it provides enhanced access control (RBAC) and auditing features. |
| **All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Medium | Yes | Granting the minimum necessary permissions via RBAC ensures that users have only the access needed to perform their tasks, thereby minimizing the risk of resource exposure in case of a user or service account compromise. |
| **Applications must not use 'namespace' level access policies for the Notification Hub** | High | No | A 'namespace' level access policy grants access to all Notification Hubs within a namespace. Instead, using an access policy at the Notification Hub level restricts access to a specific hub, aligning with the principle of least privilege. |
| **Access policies must be defined with minimum required permissions at Notification Hub level** | Medium | No | Defining access policies with the minimum necessary permissions reduces the potential impact of a compromised access policy key, limiting the operations an attacker can perform on the resource. |
| **Access policies on Notification Hub must not have 'Manage' access permissions** | High | Yes | The 'Manage' permission provides full access (Create/Update/Read/Delete/Read registrations by tag) to the Notification Hub. Using this key for runtime scenarios violates the principle of least privileged access and is similar to running with 'sa' or 'localsystem' privileges. |
| **Registration management must not be done from a native client or device app** | Medium | No | It is difficult to adequately authenticate and authorize registration requests if they are made directly from a native device app. |
| **Message body of a push notification must not contain sensitive data** | High | No | Due to the risk of exposure along the path between the backend service and the client device, push notifications should not include any sensitive data in the message body. |
| **Developers of applications that use Notification Hubs must not be granted persistent access on the subscription** | Medium | No | Persistent access to the subscription for developers who use Notification Hubs can pose operational risks, especially since telemetry data can be accessed using the Azure Service Management portal, which requires co-administrator permissions. |
| **Audit logs for Notification Hub should be enabled** | Medium | No | Enabling audit logs allows for the collection of important system events related to security. Regular monitoring of these logs can help detect and respond to suspicious or malicious activity promptly. |
| **Backup and Disaster Recovery must be planned for Notification Hub** | Medium | No | Notification Hub does not provide built-in backup and disaster recovery features. Therefore, it is essential to plan and implement adequate backup and disaster recovery measures to protect your data. |

This table provides a clear and structured overview of the controls, their severity, whether an automated fix script is available, and a detailed description of each control.
