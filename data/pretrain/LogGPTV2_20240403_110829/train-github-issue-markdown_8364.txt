 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
When tuple is passed to query() method I get the error:
      File "sqlalchemy/orm/query.py", line 3062, in __init__
        "expected - got '%r'" % column
    TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
The fix is simple, just use single item tuple as right operand:
        "expected - got '%r'" % (column,)
