**Migrated Issue, Originally Created by Anonymous**

When passing a tuple to the `query()` method, I encounter the following error:

```python
File "sqlalchemy/orm/query.py", line 3062, in __init__
    "expected - got '%r'" % column
TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
```

The solution is straightforward: use a single-item tuple as the right operand. The corrected code should look like this:

```python
"expected - got '%r'" % (column,)
```

This change ensures that the string formatting operation is performed correctly.
