### Console Configuration
```plaintext
console {
    interactive-commands warning;
}
```

### Examples: Assigning an Alternative Facility

#### Log All Messages at Error Level or Higher to the `local0` Facility on a Remote Machine
To log all messages generated on the local routing platform at the error level or higher to the `local0` facility on a remote machine called `monitor.mycompany.com`:
```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host monitor.mycompany.com {
    any error;
    facility-override local0;
}
```

#### Configure Routing Platforms in California and New York to Send Messages to a Single Remote Machine
Configure routing platforms located in California and New York to send messages to a single remote machine called `central-logger.mycompany.com`. The messages from California are assigned to the `local0` facility, and the messages from New York are assigned to the `local2` facility.

- **California Routing Platforms:**
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host central-logger.mycompany.com {
      change-log info;
      facility-override local0;
  }
  ```

- **New York Routing Platforms:**
  ```plaintext
  [edit system syslog]
  host central-logger.mycompany.com {
      change-log info;
      facility-override local2;
  }
  ```

On `central-logger`, you can then configure the system logging utility to write messages from the `local0` facility to the file `california-config` and the messages from the `local2` facility to the file `new-york-config`.

### System Logging for TX Matrix and TX Matrix Plus Routers

#### Configuring System Logging for a TX Matrix Router
To configure system logging for all routers in a routing matrix composed of a TX Matrix router and T640 routers, include the `syslog` statement at the `[edit system]` hierarchy level on the TX Matrix router. The `syslog` statement applies to every router in the routing matrix.
```plaintext
[edit system]
syslog {
    archive <size> <number>;
    console {
        facility severity;
    }
    file <filename> {
        facility severity;
        archive <size> <number>;
        explicit-priority;
        match "regular-expression";
        structured-data {
            brief;
        }
    }
    host (hostname | other-routing-engine | scc-master) {
        facility severity;
        explicit-priority;
        facility-override <facility>;
        log-prefix <string>;
        match "regular-expression";
        source-address <source-address>;
        port <port-number>;
    }
    source-address <source-address>;
    time-format (year | millisecond | year millisecond);
    (username | *) {
        facility severity;
        match "regular-expression";
    }
}
```

When included in the configuration on the TX Matrix router, the following configuration statements have the same effect as on a single-chassis system, except that they apply to every router in the routing matrix:

- **archive**: Sets the size and number of log files on each platform in the routing matrix.
- **console**: Directs the specified messages to the console of each platform in the routing matrix.
- **file**: Directs the specified messages to a file of the same name on each platform in the routing matrix.
- **match**: Limits the set of messages logged to a destination to those that contain (or do not contain) a text string matching a regular expression.
- **port**: Specifies the port number of the remote syslog server.
- **source-address**: Sets the IP address of the router to report in system log messages as the message source.
- **structured-data**: Writes messages to a file in structured-data format.
- **time-format**: Adds the millisecond, year, or both to the timestamp in each standard-format message.
- **user**: Directs the specified messages to the terminal session of one or more specified users on each platform in the routing matrix that they are logged in to.

#### Configuring System Logging for a TX Matrix Plus Router
To configure system logging for all routers in a routing matrix composed of a TX Matrix Plus router with connected T1600 or T4000 LCCs, include the `syslog` statement at the `[edit system]` hierarchy level on the SFC. The `syslog` statement applies to every router in the routing matrix.
```plaintext
[edit system]
syslog {
    archive <size> <number>;
    console {
        facility severity;
    }
    file <filename> {
        facility severity;
        archive <size> <number>;
        explicit-priority;
        match "regular-expression";
        structured-data {
            brief;
        }
    }
    host (hostname | other-routing-engine | sfc0-master) {
        facility severity;
        explicit-priority;
        facility-override <facility>;
        log-prefix <string>;
        match "regular-expression";
        source-address <source-address>;
        port <port-number>;
    }
    source-address <source-address>;
    time-format (year | millisecond | year millisecond);
    (username | *) {
        facility severity;
        match "regular-expression";
    }
}
```

When included in the configuration on the TX Matrix Plus router, the following configuration statements have the same effect as on a single-chassis system, except that they apply to every router in the routing matrix:

- **archive**: Sets the size and number of log files on each router in the routing matrix.
- **console**: Directs the specified messages to the console of each router in the routing matrix.
- **file**: Directs the specified messages to a file of the same name on each router in the routing matrix.
- **match**: Limits the set of messages logged to a destination to those that contain (or do not contain) a text string matching a regular expression.
- **source-address**: Sets the IP address of the router as the message source in system log messages.
- **structured-data**: Writes messages to a file in structured-data format.
- **time-format**: Adds the millisecond, year, or both to the timestamp in each standard-format message.
- **user**: Directs the specified messages to the terminal session of one or more specified users on each router in the routing matrix that they are logged in to.

### Configuring Message Forwarding to the TX Matrix Router
By default, the primary Routing Engine on each T640 router forwards to the primary Routing Engine on the TX Matrix router all messages from all facilities with a severity level of `info` and higher. To change the facility, the severity level, or both, include the `host scc-master` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level on the TX Matrix router:
```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host scc-master {
    facility severity;
}
```

To disable message forwarding, set the facility to `any` and the severity level to `none`:
```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host scc-master {
    any none;
}
```

In either case, the setting applies to all T640 routers in the routing matrix.

To capture the messages forwarded by the T640 routers (as well as messages generated on the TX Matrix router itself), you must also configure system logging on the TX Matrix router. Direct the messages to one or more destinations by including the appropriate statements at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level on the TX Matrix router:
- **To a file**: As described in "Directing System Log Messages to a Log File" on page 1313.
- **To the terminal session of one or more specific users (or all users)**: As described in "Directing System Log Messages to a User Terminal" on page 1314.
- **To the console**: As described in "Directing System Log Messages to the Console" on page 1315.
- **To a remote machine that is running the syslogd utility or to the other Routing Engine**: For more information, see "Directing Messages to a Remote Destination from the Routing Matrix Based on the TX Matrix Router" on page 1323.

### Configuring Message Forwarding to the TX Matrix Plus Router
By default, the primary Routing Engine on each connected T1600 or T4000 LCC forwards to the primary Routing Engine on the SFC all messages from all facilities with a severity level of `info` and higher. To change the facility, the severity level, or both, include the `host sfc0-master` statement at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level on the SFC:
```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host sfc0-master {
    facility severity;
}
```

To disable message forwarding, set the facility to `any` and the severity level to `none`:
```plaintext
[edit system syslog]
host sfc0-master {
    any none;
}
```

In either case, the setting applies to all connected LCCs in the routing matrix.

To capture the messages forwarded by the T1600 or T4000 LCCs (as well as messages generated on the SFC itself), you must also configure system logging on the SFC. Direct the messages to one or more destinations by including the appropriate statements at the `[edit system syslog]` hierarchy level on the SFC:
- **To a file**: As described in "Directing System Log Messages to a Log File" on page 1313.
- **To the terminal session of one or more specific users (or all users)**: As described in "Directing System Log Messages to a User Terminal" on page 1314.
- **To the console**: As described in "Directing System Log Messages to the Console" on page 1315.
- **To a remote machine that is running the syslogd utility or to the other Routing Engine**: For more information, see "Directing Messages to a Remote Destination from the Routing Matrix Based on a TX Matrix Plus Router" on page 1324.

### Impact of Different Local and Forwarded Severity Levels on System Log Messages

#### TX Matrix Router
- **Messages Logged When the Local and Forwarded Severity Levels Are the Same**:
  - When the severity level is the same for local and forwarded messages, the log on the TX Matrix router contains all messages from the logs on the T640 routers.
  - Example: Specify severity `info` for the `/var/log/messages` file.
  - Table 134: Example: Local and Forwarded Severity Level Are Both `info`
    - **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included**
    - T640 router | Local | `info`
    - TX Matrix router | Local | `info`
    - TX Matrix router | Forwarded from T640 routers | `info`

- **Messages Logged When the Local Severity Level Is Lower**:
  - When the severity level is lower for local messages than for forwarded messages, the log on the TX Matrix router includes fewer forwarded messages.
  - Example: Specify severity `notice` for the `/var/log/messages` file and severity `critical` for forwarded messages.
  - Table 135: Example: Local Severity Is `notice`, Forwarded Severity Is `critical`
    - **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included**
    - T640 router | Local | `notice`
    - TX Matrix router | Local | `notice`
    - TX Matrix router | Forwarded from T640 routers | `critical`

- **Messages Logged When the Local Severity Level Is Higher**:
  - When the severity level is higher for local messages than for forwarded messages, the log on the TX Matrix router includes fewer forwarded messages, and all local logs contain fewer messages overall.
  - Example: Specify severity `critical` for the `/var/log/messages` file and severity `notice` for forwarded messages.
  - Table 136: Example: Local Severity Is `critical`, Forwarded Severity Is `notice`
    - **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included**
    - T640 router | Local | `critical`
    - TX Matrix router | Local | `critical`
    - TX Matrix router | Forwarded from T640 routers | `critical`

#### TX Matrix Plus Router
- **Messages Logged When the Local and Forwarded Severity Levels Are the Same**:
  - When the severity level is the same for local and forwarded messages, the log on the TX Matrix Plus router contains all messages from the logs on the T1600 routers.
  - Example: Specify severity `info` for the `/var/log/messages` file.
  - Table 137: Example: Local and Forwarded Severity Level Are Both `info`
    - **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included**
    - T1600 router | Local | `info`
    - TX Matrix Plus router | Local | `info`
    - TX Matrix Plus router | Forwarded from T1600 routers | `info`

- **Messages Logged When the Local Severity Level Is Lower**:
  - When the severity level is lower for local messages than for forwarded messages, the log on the TX Matrix Plus router includes fewer forwarded messages.
  - Example: Specify severity `notice` for the `/var/log/messages` file and severity `critical` for forwarded messages.
  - Table 138: Example: Local Severity Is `notice`, Forwarded Severity Is `critical`
    - **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included**
    - T1600 router | Local | `notice`
    - TX Matrix Plus router | Local | `notice`
    - TX Matrix Plus router | Forwarded from T1600 routers | `critical`

- **Messages Logged When the Local Severity Level Is Higher**:
  - When the severity level is higher for local messages than for forwarded messages, the log on the TX Matrix Plus router includes fewer forwarded messages, and all local logs contain fewer messages overall.
  - Example: Specify severity `critical` for the `/var/log/messages` file and severity `notice` for forwarded messages.
  - Table 139: Example: Local Severity Is `critical`, Forwarded Severity Is `notice`
    - **Log Location** | **Source of Messages** | **Lowest Severity Included**
    - T1600 router | Local | `critical`
    - TX Matrix Plus router | Local | `critical`
    - TX Matrix Plus router | Forwarded from T1600 routers | `critical`
