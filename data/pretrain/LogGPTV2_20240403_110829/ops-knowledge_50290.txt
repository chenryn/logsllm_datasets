User: I know there are multiple solutions online, but some are for windows, some are environmental variable, etc..
What is the best way?
Assistant: Find your site-packages directory and create a new file called myproj.pth
Inside that file, put each directory you want to add, one per line like so:

/home/myuser/svn-repos/myproject
/home/myuser/svn-repos/SomeOtherProject

Python loads *.pth every time it runs, and imports all paths in each of those files. 
In Ubuntu, that directory can often be found at
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/
