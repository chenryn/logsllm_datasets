AutomatedResponse
Automated ResponseArcSight UBA 6.10 provides the option to apply response orchestration to security violations through actionable play books. In ArcSight UBA, play books contain and describe the entire incident and response management lifecycle by combining automated tasks such as gathering context on the violation and creating support tickets with the manual tasks the analyst must complete when a viol-ation occurs. Automated response reduces the time spent performing simple, repetitive tasks by automating incident triage activities and launching threat and case management functionality auto-matically.You can enable play books to launch automated tasks automatically when a violation occurs, or you can manually launch play book tasks from the violation summary screen in the Security Command Center. Play books are enabled when creating Policy Violations. 
See Enabling Play Books for more information about enabling play books when creating policy viol-ations or Launching Play Books for information about how play books are launched from the Secur-ity Command Center.Automated Response Framework Integrations
With its Automated Response integrations, ArcSight UBA can do the following:
l Launch playbooks in response to different types of threats detected by ArcSight UBA.
l Launch queries or actions on endpoints from the ArcSight UBA console in response to a threat.l Import critical UEBA alerts in CEF format from ArcSight UBA as incidents along with alerts from different security monitoring systems, and aggregate security alerts by user account into a Secur-ity Incident.
l Check the reputation of IPs, domains, URLs, and files.
l Verify if the email sender IP or domain is on a spam list.
l Get WhoIs and DNS data, and check the validity of Certificates.l Launch a network vulnerability scan.
