User: How to achieve automatic scaling of AWS EC2 instances, and what is the best practice to achieve automatic scaling?
Assistant: Automatic scaling of AWS EC2 instances can be achieved by using the AWS Auto Scaling service. AWS Auto Scaling service can automatically expand or shrink the number of application instances according to preset indicators to meet the changing needs of the system. The following are best practices for automatic scaling of AWS EC2 instances: 1. Use a clustered architecture: deploy applications on multiple EC2 instances for high availability and load balancing. 2. Preset expansion rules: automatically increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances according to specific indicators or preset rules. 3. Monitoring indicators: Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor various indicators of the system, such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, and network bandwidth, to predict system change requirements. 4. Select the appropriate instance type: According to the load and performance requirements, select the appropriate EC2 instance type to achieve the best results. 5. Use automation tools: Use automation tools such as AWS CloudFormation or AWS OpsWorks to automate the deployment and management of applications to improve system reliability and stability. 6. Security groups and access control: Standardize security groups and IAM permissions to ensure system and data security.
