User: I'm going to be using python to build a web-based asset management system to manage the production of short cg film. The app will be intranet-based running on a centos machine on the local network. I'm hoping you'll be able to browse through all the assets and shots and then open any of them in the appropriate program on the client machine (also running centos).  I'm guessing that there will have to be some sort of set up on the client-side to allow the app to run commands, which is fine because I have access to all of the clients that will be using it (although I don't have root access). Is this sort of thing possible?
Assistant: Note this is not a standard way. Imagine the websites out there had the ability to open Notepad or Minesweeper at their will when you visit or click something.
The way it is done is, you need to have a service which is running on the client machine which can expose certain apis and trust the request from the web apps call. this needs to be running on the client machines all the time and in your web app, you can send a request to this service to launch the application that you desire.
