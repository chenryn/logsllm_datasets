Domain Errors and Bounds Errors provide incorrect tracebacks when called
within loops. For example, if a file contains
    while true
    10^(-1)
    end
then the domain error is traced back to line 1, instead of line 2. Bounds
errors provide incorrect tracebacks in the following example:
    function do_something()
    foo = rand(4)
    foo[5]
    end
    while true
    do_something()
    end
In this case, the error is traced back to the do_something() line, instead of
where the error actually occurs at the foo[5] line.
