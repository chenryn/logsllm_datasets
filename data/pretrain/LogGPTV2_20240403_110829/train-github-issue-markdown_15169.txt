# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
Using for example `[name].[contenthash].js`as the filename in output.filename
leads to a compiled bundle where the `contenthash` gets compiled as a variable
instead of a string.
    /******/ 				var href = "" + ({}[chunkId]||chunkId) + "." + __webpack_require__.h ? __webpack_require__.h() : 33a77d7a305d7b86ce61 + ".css";
the using a different separator works - `[name]-[contenthash].js`
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
This occurs randomly - we had this error on different machines - with the same
node/yarn etc. versions.
Webpack config here ->

Bc this also affects the mini-css-plugin i opened an issue there -> webpack-
contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin#596
**What is the expected behavior?**  
`contenthash`should be compiled as a string.
for example:
    /******/ 				var href = "" + ({}[chunkId]||chunkId) + "." + __webpack_require__.h ? __webpack_require__.h() : "33a77d7a305d7b86ce61" + ".css";
