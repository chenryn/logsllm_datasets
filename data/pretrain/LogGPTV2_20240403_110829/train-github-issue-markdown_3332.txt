I have discovered an ErrorException which arises when calling sin() cos()
tan() or similar mathematical functions from C via jl_eval_string()
Strangely the degree variants work fine for those instances i.e sind() cosd()
tand() however this isn't always the case. atand() for example also results in
an error exception. Operators seem to work fine (1*1) for example.
Simple repro case:
jl_eval_string("sin(1.0)"); == ErrorException  
jl_eval_string("sind(1.0)"); == Works
