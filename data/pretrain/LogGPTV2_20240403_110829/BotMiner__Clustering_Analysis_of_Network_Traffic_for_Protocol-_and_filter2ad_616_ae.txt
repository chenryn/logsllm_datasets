### Enhanced Detection Features and Evasion Challenges

By incorporating additional detection features such as content inspection and host-level analysis, the detection system can make evasion more difficult. 

### Multi-Task Botnets and A-Plane Analysis

When botnets are used to perform multiple tasks (in the A-plane), they may still be detectable even if they evade C-plane monitoring and analysis. The scoring algorithm described in Section 2.7 enables cross-clustering analysis among multiple activity clusters in the A-plane. This process accumulates a suspicious score that can indicate the presence of botnets. Consequently, C-plane analysis might not be necessary if there is already a strong cross-cluster correlation among different types of malicious activities in the A-plane. For example, if a set of hosts is involved in several types of A-plane clusters (e.g., sending spam, scanning other hosts, and downloading the same binaries), they can be reported as botnets. These behaviors, by themselves, are highly suspicious and likely indicative of botnet activity [19, 20].

### Evading A-Plane Monitoring and Clustering

Botnets' malicious activities are unlikely to change significantly as long as the botmaster wants the botnets to perform "useful" tasks. However, the botmaster can attempt to evade A-plane monitoring and clustering in several ways.

#### Stealthy Malicious Activities
Botnets may perform very stealthy malicious activities to evade A-plane monitors. For instance, they can scan very slowly (e.g., one scan per hour) or send spam very slowly (e.g., one spam per day). While this can evade monitor sensors, it also limits the utility of the bots.

#### Randomized Commanding
If the botmaster commands each bot randomly and individually to perform different tasks, the bots would resemble isolated, individual malware instances. This is unlikely to be the practical use of a botnet. A more advanced evasion technique involves differentiating the bots and avoiding commanding bots in the same monitored network in the same way. This approach requires additional effort and inconvenience for the botmaster. To counter such evasion, distributed monitors can be deployed across the Internet to cover a larger monitored space.

#### Extreme Randomization
If the botmaster takes the extreme action of randomizing/individualizing both the C&C communications and attack activities of each bot, these bots are probably not part of a botnet according to our specific definition. In such cases, complementary systems like BotHunter [19] can be used to examine the behavior history of distinct hosts for a dialog or vertical correlation-based approach to detect individual bots.

### Evading Cross-Plane Analysis

A botmaster can command the bots to perform extremely delayed tasks (e.g., delayed for days after receiving commands). This separation in time between malicious activities and C&C communications can make it difficult to yield cross-plane clusters using only one day's data. A solution is to use multiple-day data and cross-check back several days. Although this can help capture these botnets, it may also generate more false positives. There is a trade-off, as a very slow C&C essentially impedes the efficiency in controlling/coordinating the bot army. Additionally, a bot-infected machine may be disconnected from the Internet or powered off by the user during the delay, making it unavailable to the botmaster.

In summary, while a botmaster can exploit the limitations of BotMiner, the convenience and efficiency of botnet C&C and the utility of the botnet also suffer. Therefore, our protocol- and structure-independent detection framework represents a significant advance in botnet detection.

### Related Work

To collect and analyze bots, researchers widely utilize honeypot techniques [4, 16, 32]. Freiling et al. [16] used honeypots to study botnets. Nepenthes [4] is a specialized honeypot tool for automatic malware sample collection. Rajab et al. [32] provided an in-depth measurement study of current botnet activities using a multi-faceted approach. Cooke et al. [10] conducted basic studies of botnet dynamics. Dagon et al. [13] proposed using DNS sinkholing for botnet study and highlighted the global diurnal behavior of botnets. Barford and Yegneswaran [6] provided a detailed study on the code base of common bot families. Collins et al. [9] presented their observations on the relationship between botnets and scanning/spamming activities.

Several recent papers have proposed different approaches to detect botnets. Ramachandran et al. [34] suggested using DNSBL counter-intelligence to find botnet members generating spams. Reiter and Yen [35] proposed TAMD to detect malware (including botnets) by aggregating traffic with similar external destinations, payloads, and internal hosts with similar OS platforms. Livadas et al. [29, 40] proposed a machine learning-based approach for botnet detection using general network-level traffic features. Karasaridis et al. [26] studied network flow level detection of IRC botnet controllers for backbone networks. Rishi [17] is a signature-based IRC botnet detection system. Binkley and Singh [7] proposed combining IRC statistics and TCP work weight for IRC-based botnet detection. BotHunter [19] uses dialog correlation to associate IDS events with a user-defined bot infection model. BotSniffer [20] is an anomaly-based botnet C&C detection system that uses horizontal correlation.

Most of the aforementioned systems are limited to specific botnet protocols and structures, often focusing on IRC-based botnets. BotMiner, however, is a novel general detection system that does not have such limitations and can complement existing detection approaches.

### Conclusion and Future Work

Botnet detection is a challenging problem. In this paper, we proposed a novel network anomaly-based botnet detection system that is independent of the protocol and structure used by botnets. Our system exploits the essential definition and properties of botnets, i.e., bots within the same botnet will exhibit similar C&C communication patterns and similar malicious activity patterns. In our experimental evaluation on real-world network traces, BotMiner showed excellent detection accuracy on various types of botnets (including IRC-based, HTTP-based, and P2P-based botnets) with a very low false positive rate on normal traffic.

Future botnets, especially P2P botnets, may employ evasion techniques to avoid detection, as discussed in Section 4. In future work, we will study new techniques to monitor and cluster communication and activity patterns of botnets, aiming to be more robust against evasion attempts. We also plan to improve the efficiency of C-flow converting and clustering algorithms, combine different correlation techniques, and develop new real-time detection systems based on a layered design using sampling techniques for high-speed and large-scale network environments.
