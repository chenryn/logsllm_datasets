I am currently using the `camera` package from https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/camera, and I am experiencing an issue with image updates. In my `build()` method, I instantiate an `Image` widget using `Image.file(File(img))`, where `img` is the local file path of the image saved from the camera. The file is successfully saved, and the new path is correctly passed to Flutter. However, the image does not update in the UI. According to issue #7503, this problem was supposed to be fixed, but it still appears to be present.

Here are the details of my development environment:
- Flutter (Channel dev, v0.4.0) on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.5], locale en-US
- Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK 27.0.3)
- Android Studio (version 3.1)
- Visual Studio Code, 64-bit edition (version 1.23.0)
- Connected devices: 1 available

Could you please provide any guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?
