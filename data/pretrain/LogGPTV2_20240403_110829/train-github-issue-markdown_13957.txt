am using the https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/camera  
and am having a problem with image update. I have an image instantiated in my
`build()` method with a new `Image.file(new File(img))`, where file is the
local file saved from the camera. The file is saved and and new path is send
to Flutter, but the image is not updated and according to this issue #7503
this is supposed to be fixed but it does not look that way.
