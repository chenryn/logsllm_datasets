When project does import properties from separate MSBuild file via ``, The MSBuild is using defined properties, but on
file save of TS file it is being ignored.  
It worked with with VS13/VS15RC and TS 1.5 beta, but after release it is
broken.
I can provide ZIP file with example solution, but I cannot add it to github
issue.
