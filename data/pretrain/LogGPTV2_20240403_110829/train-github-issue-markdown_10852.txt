Hi,
I am in the process of designing the architecture using Spring Framwork.  
We are looking for the solution as follows
Client calls the EJB Layer and EJB Layer initiates the transaction management
i.e. Stateless Session Bean with CMT. Stateless Session Bean in turn calls the
Spring Service Layer Which in turn calls the POJO i.e. Hibernate.
My Question is If I will set the Session Beam Transaction as REQUIRES_NEW i.e.
JTA Application Server and Service Layer of Spring Framework will be using
JTATransaction and method is having PROPAGATION as Required Transaction.
jdbc/jpetstore  
org/springframework/samples/petclinic/hibernate/petclinic.hbm.xml  
${hibernate.dialect}  
Will this work architecture work. As EJB has initiated the transaction. Will
it possible that POJO method works in the same transaction or Not. I will
appreciate If you guys can help me out.
Kind Regards  
Deepak
