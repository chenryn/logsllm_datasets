**User:** I would like to download all blobs as a single zipped file (or another way) to my computer. Is there any way to do that? I am using the Python SDK.

**Assistant:** While it is possible to download all blobs as a single zipped file, it might be more efficient and reliable to download them one at a time. This approach allows you to resume the process from where it left off in case of an interruption, rather than starting over from the beginning. 

If you still prefer to download all blobs as a single zipped file, you can use the Azure Storage SDK for Python to achieve this. Here’s a general outline of the steps you could follow:

1. **List All Blobs:** Retrieve a list of all the blobs in your container.
2. **Create a Zip File:** Use the `zipfile` module in Python to create a zip file.
3. **Download and Add Blobs to the Zip File:** Download each blob and add it to the zip file.
4. **Save the Zip File Locally:** Save the zip file to your local machine.

Here is a basic example to get you started:

```python
import zipfile
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, ContainerClient

# Initialize the BlobServiceClient
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string("your_connection_string")
container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client("your_container_name")

# Create a new zip file
with zipfile.ZipFile('blobs.zip', 'w') as zipf:
    # List all blobs in the container
    for blob in container_client.list_blobs():
        # Download the blob
        blob_client = container_client.get_blob_client(blob.name)
        blob_data = blob_client.download_blob().readall()
        
        # Add the blob to the zip file
        zipf.writestr(blob.name, blob_data)

print("All blobs have been downloaded and zipped.")
```

This script will download all blobs from the specified container and save them into a single zip file named `blobs.zip` on your local machine. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
