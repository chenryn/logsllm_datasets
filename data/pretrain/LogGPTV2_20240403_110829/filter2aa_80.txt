### What is Foxhunting?
Foxhunting involves locating the physical position of wireless emitters and their users by measuring received power from different locations. It is particularly useful for distances between the "last mile" and the "last feet." Other techniques are more suitable for greater or lesser distances.

#### Applications:
- **Wet-work ninjas** finding the correct bedroom in the house of a South American populist government official.
- **Tracking corporate executives** whose iPhones have been compromised and turned into access points during Red Team penetration tests.
- **DEFCON 22 Wireless CTF** (Capture the Flag) event.
- Techniques are applicable to all RF emitters, including mobile phones, WiFi access points, heart monitors, etc.

### Equipment Involved
- **Antennas**: Omnidirectional and directional, each with specific purposes.
- **Radios**: Capable of receiving the signal of interest. Software-defined radios (SDRs) are becoming more affordable.
- **Visualization Software**: Essential for viewing received power over time.

### Gear Selection: Antennas

#### Aperture Versus Gain
- More sensitive antennas tend to be more directional.
- High gain requires accurate pointing and can be detrimental if not managed properly.
- The power curve follows the Inverse-Square Law.
- Without proper attenuation, high gain can reduce range discrimination when close to an emitter.

#### Omnidirectional Antennas
- Typically have a toroidal radiation pattern.
- Gain varies inversely with z-axis directionality.
- High gain provides greater detection distance and allows some degree of attenuation by varying orientation.

#### Directional Antennas
- **Yagi**: High gain, narrow aperture, and narrow bandwidth.
- **Panel**: Refers to several flat, perpendicular-to-boresight antennas with varying performance.
- **Log-periodic antennas**: Less common but available.
- Budget-friendly options include DIY Cantenna or WokFi.
- Choose based on performance and form factor.

#### Directional Antenna Pattern
- Be cautious of back lobes and side lobes during hunting.

#### Multi-antenna Arrays
- Generally proprietary and expensive.
- Require custom software and can be tricky to configure.
- Highly effective when used correctly.
- Challenge: Create a HackRF-based DF array.

### Gear Selection: Radios

#### Cost Versus Performance
- Broadband and SDRs are more flexible but more expensive than application-specific radios.
- Low-cost SDRs are becoming more accessible.
- WiFi radios, such as Alfa 1 and Alfa N, are inexpensive and perfect for beginners.

#### Variable Attenuators
- Used to reduce the strength of the received signal.
- Allow the use of high-gain antennas at close ranges.
- Not strictly necessary but add versatility.
- Available on eBay; rotating the antenna can also act as a variable attenuator.

#### Signal Displays
- **Power Spectral Display (PSD)**: Helps locate the target in the RF spectrum.
- **Power/Time Domain (PTD)**: Tracks the target over time; ideal for foxhunting.
- **Cumulative Spectral Decay / Spectrogram / Waterfall**: Combines PSD and PTD; useful for tracking multiple emitters but can be overwhelming for simple foxhunting.

### Using Your Gear

#### Preparation
- Familiarize yourself with your equipment, especially battery life.
- Learn the detection ranges for your setup; WiFi radios can estimate signal strength inconsistently.
- Understand the sensitivity of your back and side lobes.
- Become proficient with the software you are using.
- Practice regularly.

#### Inconspicuousness
- Avoid drawing attention with obvious equipment.
- Blend in to avoid spooking your target.

#### General Tips
- Be proactive in seeking your target.
- Organize your search area and maintain a mental map of signal levels.
- Stay aware of your surroundings and avoid fixating on the screen.

#### Multipath
- RF signals reflect off structures and objects, causing phase shifts and multipath fading.
- To mitigate interference, keep moving.

#### Using an Omnidirectional Antenna
- Useful for proximity detection.
- Move around to determine emitter proximity from various locations.
- Maintain a mental map for on-the-fly triangulation.

#### Using a Directional Antenna
- Guides you in the right direction after determining proximity with the omni.
- A variable attenuator between the directional antenna and radio enhances directionality and reduces gain when close to the emitter.

#### Basic Strategy
- Tune your radios to the target emitter.
- Walk a search pattern, monitoring signal strength on a PTD plot.
- Use the omni to determine proximity.
- Use the directional antenna and historical direction to continue.
- Add attenuation if the signal peaks.
- Move slowly to account for fluctuations in received power.
- Look for visual indicators that match the RF power readings.

#### My WiFi Setup
- **Omnidirectional**: 5dB rubber duck.
- **Directional**: 8dB simpleWiFi mini panel.
- **Attenuator**: HP 8495A Manual Step Attenuator.
- **Radios**: Alfa USB NICs - Alfa 1 & Alfa N.
- **Software**: Kismet/Kismon, WiFi Analyzer (Android), and NetSurveyor (Windows).

This setup is effective for both omni and directional use, with the Alfa N holding connections better on the omni and the Alfa 1 functioning as a pure radio on the panel.
