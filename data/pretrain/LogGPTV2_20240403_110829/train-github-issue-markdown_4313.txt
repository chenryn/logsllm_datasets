Recently experiencing a ton of crashes which require me to reload the entire
editor window when renaming files.
I cannot say for sure, but I have a feeling its related to new files. That is,
files created after the initial editor window is loaded (again, not 100% on
that).
#### Steps:
  1. Create a new file in the project directory currently open in Atom (either using Atom or `echo "Test" >> new.txt`).
  2. Rename the file (either using Atom of `mv new.txt old.txt`)
  3. Crash window opens and forced to reload the editor.
_Note:_ Quitting then relaunching does not seem to help.
#### System:
  * **Atom** : `0.146.0`
  * **System** : `OS X 10.10`
