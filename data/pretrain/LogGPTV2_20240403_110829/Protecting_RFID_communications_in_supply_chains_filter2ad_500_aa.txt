chain management and beneﬁts all involved parties. RFID tags are
thus considered as the 21st century replacement for the Universal
Product Code bar codes developed in 1970s.
Like a double-edged sword, RFID technology has also triggered
signiﬁcant security concerns. For example, an industry espionage
may eavesdrop wireless RFID communications to collect inventory
information; tag spooﬁng/cloning may cause signiﬁcant loss to sup-
ply chain partners. As RFID enabled supply chains will likely soon
become ubiquitous, it is crucial to mitigate the security concerns in
a cost-effective manner without downgrading the efﬁciency of sup-
ply chain management due to the deployment of RFID technology.
In this paper, we focus on how to protect RFID communications
in supply chain environments. Our work is complementary to the
rigorous efforts that have been made in RFID related cryptogra-
phy and security research [7, 18], including tag killing, tag block-
ing, storing encrypted information in tags, using tag passwords
or pseudonyms, distance-sensitive tag reading, and policy making.
The previous work primarily investigates the privacy issues related
to individual customers or the security issues related to a single
reader-tag channel. Little work has been conducted to address the
security issues in supply chain applications, which however repre-
sent the major driving force behind the commercial deployment of
RFID technology. As indicated below, supply chain applications
impose a different set of security requirements and thus deserve a
new treatment to protect RFID communications.
Previous work The security and privacy concerns posed by RFID
technology can be roughly classiﬁed into corporate data security,
which primarily affects corporations and organizations inside sup-
ply chains, and personal privacy, which primarily affects individual
customers outside supply chains [7]. Typical existing schemes in-
clude: (i) tag killing [20], in which tags of sold items are disabled
or removed at the point-of-sale, (ii) tag blocking [11], in which a
blocker tag creates an radio frequency environment that prevents
unauthorized scanning of consumer items, (iii) encryption [9, 8, 1],
in which the information stored in tags is encrypted in a dynamic
manner, (iv) using passwords [22], in which a tag responses to a
reader only if it receives the right password, (v) using pseudonyms
[9], in which each tag is associated with a set of pseudonyms and
cycles through them each time it is read, (vi) distance-sensitive tag
reading [5], in which the tag changes its behavior according to the
distance to its reader, and (vii) policy making [6], in which guiding
principles for RFID system creation and deployment are stipulated.
The privacy and security aspects of RFID systems have also been
investigated in the context of libraries [17], banknotes [10, 8], and
recent theoretical development [20, 4, 16, 12, 2, 24, 19] .
Most of these schemes focus on addressing the privacy concerns
related to individual customers or the security concerns related to
single reader-tag channel. Little attention has been paid to ad-
ABSTRACT
Recent years have seen much growing attention on RFID security.
However, little work has been performed to address the security is-
sues in the context of supply chain management, which is exactly
the major ﬁeld for RFID applications. Existing RFID solutions can-
not be applied directly in this ﬁeld because of a set of special RFID
security requirements to be addressed for supply chain manage-
ment. The major contribution of this paper is to identify the unique
set of security requirements in supply chains and to propose a prac-
tical design of RFID communication protocols that satisfy the se-
curity requirements.

INTRODUCTION

Motivation Adopting RFID technology is an emerging trend in
supply chain management. In fact, one of the major motivations
for developing RFID techniques is to improve the efﬁciency in sup-
ply chain management due to its strong and expanding market. As
forecasted by Frost & Sullivan, the total worldwide supply chain
management market is expected to grow by 11.2 percent per year,
reaching $9,668.7 million in 20101. Several major retail chains in-
cluding Albertsons, Target, and WalMart have requested all their
suppliers to adopt RFID; meanwhile, the Department of Defense in
the United States has ordered that all shipments to its armed forces
be equipped with RFID tags. With RFID technology, product infor-
mation can be efﬁciently collected, tracked, shared, and managed
in a real time manner. This helps reduce the overall cost of supply

and perform logical operations, and a coiled antenna, to commu-
nicate with RFID readers via radio frequency signals through non-
conducting material. RFID tags can store a 64-bit or more unique
code. Typical RFID coding schemes include the Electronic Prod-
uct Code (EPC) that is developed in MIT Auto-ID center [20] for
unique identiﬁcation of all physical objects. The EPC code in a tag
indicates the owner, type, and serial number of the item to which
the tag is attached. The code serves as a pointer which can be used
to obtain more detailed information about the item from the Inter-
net. Based on its capability for write operations, RFID tags can
be read-only, write-once read-many, or fully rewritable. Low-cost
passive RFID tags are of primary interests in RFID-based system
applications. Unfortunately, due to their miserable computation
resource, it is infeasible to incorporate into such tags any public
key primitives, even standard symmetric key encryption/decryption
algorithms (e.g., AES). To secure RFID communications, various
light-weight security protocols have been designed, where mostly
hash functions and XOR operations are involved. In this paper, we
consider fully rewritable passive RFID tags.
RFID Reader An RFID reader is used to read and write tag data
via wireless interactions, and to connect with back-end data pro-
cessing systems via wired connections. Compared with tags, the
costs of readers are less restrictive. RFID readers can be equipped
with more internal storage and processing power. Various anti-
collision methods (e.g., binary tree walking and Aloha scheme)
are developed to support effective and efﬁcient communications be-
tween multiple readers and multiple tags at the same time [20].
There are two communication channels between readers and tags.
The reader-to-tag channel, a.k.a.
forward channel, is broadcast
based and delivers strong signals which can be captured from a long
distance, perhaps 100 meters. On the other hand, the tag-to-reader
channel, a.k.a. backward channel, is a much weaker one which can
only be received within short ranges, for example, several meters
for low-cost passive tags.
Data Processing Sub-System A data processing sub-system con-
sists of (i) a network of savant computers that collect data from
distributed RFID readers, (ii) back-end databases that contain de-
tailed information about the tagged items (e.g., product informa-
tion, tracking log, and key management data), and (iii) manage-
ment and control components that facilitate information ﬂow and
supply chain applications. Due to extreme scarcity of RFID tags’
computation resource, typical data processing sub-system such as
the Savant System [20] shifts most of the load from tags to readers
and servant computers.
Supply Chain Structure While Figure 1 illustrates a sectional
view of two interacting partners within an exemplary supply chain
system, a panoramic view on supply chains may have four differ-
ent structures: third-party logistics (3PL), vendor managed inven-
tory (VMI), collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment
(CPFR), and supply network (SN). These structures are deﬁned
based on the collaboration relationships among supply chain part-
ners. In brief, 3PL enables companies to concentrate on their core
competencies and outsource shipping to other parties. In VMI, the
vendors take over the replenishment planning tasks for their trading
partners. CPFR is a collaborative arrangement of multiple parties
for real-time sharing of demand and supply data. SN is similar
to CPFR, however with more complex collaborative processes and
more ad hoc information ﬂows. For each supply chain structure,
a different set of data objects (e.g., inventory management, prod-
uct information, order management, production management, ser-
vice and support, and supply chain plan) are required to be shared
among supply chain partners. The reader is referred to [13] for
more details about information sharing in different supply chain
dressing the corporate data security issues within a supply chain
domain. In the design of practical solutions for secure RFID com-
munications in supply chains, special cares are needed to take into
account supply chain structure information, interactions between
supply chain partners, and supply chain visibility etc. For instance,
in supply chain applications, one cannot assume that an RFID tag
shares a secret key with all RFID readers as the tagged item (or
pallet) is processed by readers belonging to different partners fol-
lowing the material ﬂow. Because of this, existing RFID solutions
cannot be applied directly to address the corporate data security
issues in supply chain scenarios.
Our contribution We extend the previous efforts by considering
the entire information process in supply chain management. Our
contributions are mainly twofold. First, we spell out four security
requirements in applying RFID tags in supply chains: authoritative
access, authenticity of tags, unlinkability and supply chain visibil-
ity. Note that though some of them inherit their security notions
from generalized RFID applications, they show new implications
under the supply chain context. Second, we propose a holistic
RFID framework including RFID read and write protocols. Our
scheme is practical and meets all the aforementioned challenges.
Paper organization The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we brieﬂy describe the technical background for RFID
enabled supply chains and identify the security challenges. In Sec-
tion 3, we propose our protocols for secure supply chain RFID
communications. In Section 4, we analyze the security and perfor-
mance issues on our proposed system. Finally, Section 5 concludes
this paper.
2. BACKGROUND
A typical RFID enabled supply chain is illustrated in Figure 1.
In this ﬁgure, supply chain partners A and B are connected via the
Internet. To reduce the cost of RFID tags, bulky data about product
details is stored in backend databases and accessible through the In-
ternet. Only minimum amount of information such as product IDs
and light-weight security primitives is stored in RFID tags. The
RFID tags are attached to containers, pallets, and/or items. On the
arrival of a material ﬂow, a supply chain partner uses RFID read-
ers to collect product information from RFID tags via a wireless
communication channel. The collected information is then sent to
the so-called savant computers for further interpretation and pro-
cess. Meanwhile, a supply chain information ﬂow can take place
between supply chain partners through Internet connections.

2.1 Security Requirements for RFID Applica-
tions in Supply Chains
Common security requirements of RFID tags include untrace-
ability, conﬁdentiality, etc, as discussed in existing RFID litera-
tures. Nonetheless, applying RFID tags in supply chain environ-
ments introduces a unique set of parameters. Therefore, some of
the generalized RFID security properties are bestowed with new
implications. Moreover, supply chain applications also bring in
their unique security challenges.
In the following, we list those
security requirements under the supply chain context.
• AUTHORITATIVE ACCESS: It means that the RFID tags in
a shipment to partner Pi are only accessible by authorized
readers of partners Pi. In other words, only legitimate read-
ers are allowed to identify and update the tags. Note that
Pi−1 has the ability to read the tags as well since Pi−1 is the
deliverer of the shipment to Pi.
• AUTHENTICITY OF TAGS: It means that in a supply chain
link from Pi−1 to Pi, only legitimate RFID tags delivered by
Pi−1 will be accepted by Pi’s readers. This is crucial for a
supply chain partner since it ensures that only the expected
ﬂows are accepted and processed accordingly.
• UNLINKABILITY: For a partner in a supply chain, a rogue
RFID reader may interrogate a tag in its inbound material
ﬂow and another tag in its outbound material ﬂow. Unlin-
ability ensures that it is infeasible for the rogue reader to
determine by observing both responses whether both its in-
terrogations are upon the same tag. Note that unlinkability
is a weaker variant of untraceability, which is an important
requirement for RFID-based applications due to the fact that
RFID tags can be probed unwittingly from a distance. In its
traditional sense, untraceability requires that (i) an unautho-
rized reader cannot obtain a valid tag’s identity from its reply,
and (ii) an unauthorized reader cannot link any two replies to
the same tag; that is, it cannot distinguish between any two
replies from the same tag (probed at different times) and any
two replies from two different tags. However, in a supply
chain environment, the global structure of the supply chain
is of more security concerns. A correlation of inbound ﬂow
and outbound ﬂow reveals critical information of a supply
chain, whereas tracking tags within an isolated ﬂow poses
little threat since no personal privacy is involved2.
• SUPPLY CHAIN VISIBILITY:
It has twofold implications:
(1)The manager of the supply chain is able to track the RFID
tags; (2) At any phase of the material ﬂow, the manager of
the supply chain is able to open RFID tags and identify the

mon requirement to enable visibility in supply chain man-
agement. The most attractive feature of RFID techniques in
supply chain is its enhancement on supply chain visibility. It
allows companies to track and monitor the progress of mate-
rial ﬂow without inefﬁcient bar code scanning. Any secure
RFID protocol in supply chains must maintain supply chain
visibility.
2Note that the unlinkability is required within supply chains while
the untraceability should be enforced outside of supply chains (after
customers buy tagged products).
3. OUR SOLUTION
In this section, we propose a secure RFID communication frame-
work in a supply chain environment.
3.1 System Model
We consider a supply chain consisting of N partners, denoted by
P1, P2,··· , PN . Each partner is independently managed by her
own organization. They may or may not trust each other. A partner
or a collusion of some of them, may attempt to mount attacks on
the RFID system in order to achieve certain malicious goals. A
material ﬂow of items is equipped with RFID tags. It originates
from P1 and is shipped along the supply chain in the sequence of
P1, P2,··· , Pi, Pi+1,··· , PN . When the ﬂow arrives at Pi, Pi is
required to read and update all RFID tags.
We assume that every partner has limited knowledge of her local
neighborhood in the whole supply chain. Namely, for all 1 ≤ i <
N, partner Pi is aware of her subsequent peer Pi+1 and for all 1 <
i ≤ N, Pi is aware of her preceding peer Pi−1. Nonetheless, we
do not assume, nor require that a partner has the global information
