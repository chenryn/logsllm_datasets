## Abstract
Recent years have seen growing attention on RFID security. However, little work has been done to address the security issues in the context of supply chain management, which is the primary field for RFID applications. Existing RFID solutions cannot be directly applied in this field due to unique security requirements. The major contribution of this paper is to identify these unique security requirements and propose a practical design of RFID communication protocols that satisfy these requirements.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation
The adoption of RFID technology is an emerging trend in supply chain management. One of the main motivations for developing RFID techniques is to improve the efficiency of supply chain management. As forecasted by Frost & Sullivan, the global supply chain management market is expected to grow by 11.2 percent per year, reaching $9,668.7 million in 2010. Major retail chains such as Albertsons, Target, and WalMart have mandated their suppliers to adopt RFID, and the U.S. Department of Defense has ordered all shipments to its armed forces to be equipped with RFID tags. RFID technology enables real-time collection, tracking, sharing, and management of product information, thereby reducing overall supply chain costs.

### 1.2 Background
RFID tags are wireless transmitters attached to objects, consisting of a microchip to store data and perform logical operations, and a coiled antenna for communication via radio frequency signals. These tags can store a 64-bit or more unique code, such as the Electronic Product Code (EPC) developed at the MIT Auto-ID center. EPC codes provide unique identification for physical objects, including the owner, type, and serial number of the item. 

RFID readers are used to read and write tag data wirelessly and connect to back-end data processing systems. They can handle multiple tags simultaneously using anti-collision methods. There are two communication channels: the forward channel (reader-to-tag) and the backward channel (tag-to-reader). The forward channel is broadcast-based and can cover long distances, while the backward channel is weaker and limited to short ranges.

A data processing sub-system includes savant computers, back-end databases, and management and control components. Due to the limited computational resources of RFID tags, most data processing is shifted to readers and savant computers.

### 1.3 Security Challenges
While RFID technology offers significant benefits, it also raises significant security concerns. For example, industry espionage may eavesdrop on wireless RFID communications to collect inventory information, and tag spoofing or cloning can cause substantial losses to supply chain partners. As RFID-enabled supply chains become ubiquitous, it is crucial to mitigate these security concerns in a cost-effective manner without degrading the efficiency of supply chain management.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Technical Overview
A typical RFID-enabled supply chain involves multiple partners connected via the Internet. To reduce the cost of RFID tags, detailed product information is stored in backend databases, while only minimal information and lightweight security primitives are stored in the tags. When a material flow arrives, a supply chain partner uses RFID readers to collect product information from the tags, which is then processed by savant computers and shared with other partners through the Internet.

### 2.2 Security Requirements for RFID Applications in Supply Chains
Applying RFID tags in supply chain environments introduces unique security challenges. We list the following security requirements:

- **Authoritative Access**: Only authorized readers of partner Pi should be able to access the RFID tags in a shipment to Pi.
- **Authenticity of Tags**: Only legitimate RFID tags delivered by Pi−1 should be accepted by Pi’s readers.
- **Unlinkability**: A rogue reader should not be able to determine if two interrogations (one in inbound and one in outbound material flow) are upon the same tag.
- **Supply Chain Visibility**: The manager of the supply chain should be able to track and identify the last partner who processed the RFID tags.

## 3. Our Solution

### 3.1 System Model
We consider a supply chain with N partners, denoted as P1, P2, ..., PN. Each partner is independently managed and may or may not trust each other. A material flow equipped with RFID tags originates from P1 and is shipped along the supply chain in the sequence P1, P2, ..., Pi, Pi+1, ..., PN. When the flow arrives at Pi, Pi is required to read and update all RFID tags.

We assume that each partner has limited knowledge of their local neighborhood in the supply chain. Specifically, for all 1 ≤ i < N, partner Pi is aware of her subsequent peer Pi+1, and for all 1 < i ≤ N, Pi is aware of her preceding peer Pi−1. However, we do not assume that a partner has global information about the entire supply chain.

### 3.2 Proposed Framework
Our proposed framework includes secure RFID read and write protocols that meet the identified security requirements. The protocols ensure authoritative access, authenticity of tags, unlinkability, and supply chain visibility. We will detail the protocols in the next section.

## 4. Security and Performance Analysis

In this section, we analyze the security and performance of our proposed system. We evaluate the effectiveness of the protocols in addressing the security requirements and discuss their impact on the efficiency of supply chain management.

## 5. Conclusion

This paper identifies the unique security requirements for RFID applications in supply chains and proposes a practical design of RFID communication protocols. Our solution ensures authoritative access, authenticity of tags, unlinkability, and supply chain visibility, making it suitable for secure RFID communications in supply chain environments.
