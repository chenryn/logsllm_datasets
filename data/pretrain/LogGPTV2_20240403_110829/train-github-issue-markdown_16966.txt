I am interested in using the Deformable Convolution Network developed by MSRA. I discovered that it has already been implemented in PyTorch, and the repository can be found at: [https://github.com/oeway/pytorch-deform-conv](https://github.com/oeway/pytorch-deform-conv).

Is there any possibility of integrating this module into the core PyTorch library?
