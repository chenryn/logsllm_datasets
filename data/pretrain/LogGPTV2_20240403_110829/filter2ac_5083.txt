### Title: Black Hat Asia 2020: The Inside Story - There Are Apps in Apps, and Here's How to Break Them

**Abstract:**

With the rapid advancement of mobile internet, applications have become increasingly complex. However, their most frequently used features are often confined to a few pages. Enter instant apps. Instant apps offer several advantages over traditional apps, including click-to-play functionality and a more streamlined design, making them increasingly popular. Many popular platforms, such as Google Play, WeChat, and TikTok, incorporate instant app frameworks. Additionally, many smartphone manufacturers embed these frameworks into their pre-installed applications.

Despite their widespread use, there is a notable lack of public research on the security vulnerabilities of instant apps. In this presentation, we will delve into the common architecture of instant app frameworks and demonstrate various attack models. Through reverse engineering of top instant app frameworks, we will illustrate how to bypass different sandboxing and restriction technologies, thereby breaking the isolation between instant apps.

These vulnerabilities can lead to serious consequences, including sensitive information leakage, identity theft, and account takeovers. During our study of Google Instant Apps, we also discovered methods to bypass component access restrictions, significantly expanding the potential attack surface. These vulnerabilities and attack models affect over 60% of Android devices, impacting at least one billion users.

We will summarize the root causes of these vulnerabilities at the architectural level and highlight potential attack points. Additionally, we will propose practical mitigation measures for specific vulnerabilities. Our goal is to raise awareness among users and developers about the potential security risks associated with instant apps while still enjoying their convenience. We also aim to alert the broader security community to this emerging threat landscape.
