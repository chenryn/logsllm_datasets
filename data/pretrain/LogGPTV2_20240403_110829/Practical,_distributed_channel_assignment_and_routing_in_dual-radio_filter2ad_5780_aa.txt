ABSTRACT
Realizing the full potential of a multi-radio mesh network
involves two main challenges: how to assign channels to ra-
dios at each node to minimize interference and how to choose
high throughput routing paths in the face of lossy links,
variable channel conditions and external load. This paper
presents ROMA, a practical, distributed channel assignment
and routing protocol that achieves good multi-hop path per-
formance between every node and one or more designated
gateway nodes in a dual-radio network. ROMA assigns non-
overlapping channels to links along each gateway path to
eliminate intra-path interference. ROMA reduces inter-path
interference by assigning diﬀerent channels to paths destined
for diﬀerent gateways whenever possible. Evaluations on a
24-node dual-radio testbed show that ROMA achieves high
throughput in a variety of scenarios.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless mesh networks comprised of nodes having multi-
ple radios (multi-radio mesh networks) have the potential to
perform signiﬁcantly better than single radio mesh networks.
Since every node operates its radio on the same channel in a
single-radio mesh network, a forwarding node interferes with
the two subsequent nodes along any multi-hop path, drasti-
cally reducing the end-to-end throughput [7, 23]. A multi-
radio mesh can eliminate such intra-path interference if po-
tentially interfering links are operated on non-overlapping

channels. Another important advantage of multi-radio net-
works is the ability to use many non-overlapping channels in
the same physical region. As a result, there is less inter-path
interference among multiple ﬂows in a multi-radio mesh, re-
sulting in higher aggregate throughput.
While there has been signiﬁcant work on multi-radio mesh
protocols [16, 20, 30, 32, 4, 29, 13], realizing the full poten-
tial of multi-radio mesh networks in real-world settings has
remained a challenging problem. Real-world deployments,
especially in urban settings, pose many practical challenges
and constraints that aﬀect both the design and performance
of a multi-radio protocol. To the best of our knowledge, only
a few of protocols [32, 31, 20] have been implemented and
even fewer have been evaluated on a testbed of reasonable
scale [31, 20].
Each node in a multi-radio network can be equipped with
only a few radios. Commodity radios operating in the same
frequency band interfere within close proximity (up to 18
inches). Since there are only two frequency bands (2.4 and
5.2 GHz) for use by 802.11 today, a physically compact node
is restricted to using only two radios per node. Thus, a
multi-radio protocol should perform well on a dual-radio
mesh but also be extensible to handle more than two ra-
dios per node, should additional orthogonal frequency bands
become available.
Channels must be assigned carefully to reduce interference
in the network. However, when there are only a few radios
at each node, it is not feasible to optimize for all paths si-
multaneously. Fortunately, not all paths are equally impor-
tant. Most mesh deployments today have a few pre-speciﬁed
gateway nodes and users care most about achieving high
throughput on multi-hop paths from each non-gateway node
to a gateway. To take advantage of such traﬃc patterns,
each node should choose routes and channel assignments
together to optimize for its gateway paths: when done cor-
rectly, one can construct multi-hop gateway paths consisting
of high quality links operating on non-overlapping channels
and also reduce inter-path interference among paths to dif-
ferent gateways.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation and
evaluation of ROMA, a distributed routing and channel
assignment protocol that achieves high end-to-end perfor-
mance for gateway paths in a dual-radio mesh. In ROMA,
each gateway chooses a channel sequence, e.g. c1, c2, ..., to
guide other nodes’ channel assignment. Speciﬁcally, a node

ting radios operate on channel 40 (5.22 GHz) and 165
(5.825 GHz), respectively. Their antennas must be sep-
arated by 18 inches to prevent the transmitter from in-
terfering with a weak received signal.
i hops away assigns channels ci and ci+1 according to the
corresponding gateway’s sequence. Since each sequence con-
sists of distinct, non-overlapping channels, all gateway paths
avoid intra-path interference. ROMA reduces inter-path in-
terference as multiple interfering gateways try to use diﬀer-
ent channels in their channel sequences. Although propos-
als that perform joint channel assignment and routing ex-
ist [32, 4], ROMA is the ﬁrst distributed joint protocol that
addresses real world challenges such as lossy and highly vari-
able channel conditions. In particular, ROMA contributes
a novel measurement-driven path metric that takes into ac-
count link delivery ratios, ﬂuctuations in link quality as well
as external load. This path metric allows ROMA to choose
multi-hop paths with good performance.
Using a detailed evaluation of ROMA on a 24-node dual-
radio testbed, we show that ROMA achieves high end-to-end
throughput; Paths with three or more hops have a median
throughput of 4.1 Mbps, a mere 7% drop in performance
compared to that of single-hop paths. ROMA’s median ag-
gregate throughput reaches 14.8 Mbps with three gateway
nodes, which is 1.4× what is achieved when restricting all
nodes to use a common channel and 2.1× what is achieved
when assigning identical channels to all nodes.
2. CONSTRAINTS AND CHALLENGES
This section describes our problem setting and outlines
important practical constraints and challenges.
2.1 The Case for Dual Radios
A multi-radio node forwards packets by simultaneously
transmitting and receiving on diﬀerent radios. Although
there are many orthogonal channels (3 for 802.11b/g, 13
for 802.11a), it is challenging for a multi-radio node to use
diﬀerent channels from the same frequency band because a
node’s transmitting radio might interfere with its receiving
radio, unless the two radios are separated by a suﬃcient dis-
tance. In order to understand these radio separation con-
straints, we performed the following experiment with two
mesh nodes: We used one node to receive packets sent from
a laptop while the other node was simultaneously transmit-
ting packets. The receiving radio operates on channel 40 (5.2
GHz) and the transmitting radio is on channel 165 (5.825

link observed over a 20 second period.
GHz). We varied the physical distance between the two
mesh nodes. Furthermore, we also changed the distance be-
tween the laptop and the receiving radio to vary the received
signal strength. Figure 1 shows that, in order to prevent the
transmitting radio from interfering with a relatively weak re-
ceived signal, their antennas must be separated by at least
18 inches. Similar results are obtained with a variety of
diﬀerent cards and chipsets [11, 34, 2].
To avoid interference in the same frequency band, one
could ensure antenna separation using long pigtails [11],
USB cables [13, 30] or Ethernet connections [31]. However,
the resulting increase in node size is non-trivial and would
signiﬁcantly limit node placement, especially in indoor set-
tings. As there is no interference among channels in diﬀer-
ent frequency bands, we can build compact dual-radio nodes
by operating a node’s two radios on 802.11a and 802.11b/g
channels. Any 3-radio compact mesh node is bound to have
interference across simultaneously sending and receiving ra-
dios because at least two of them have to operate on the same
frequency band. To maintain the deployment advantage of
compact nodes, we focus on dual-radio mesh networks. Our
protocol can also be extended to work with more than two
radios at each node (Section 3.6).
2.2 Problem Setting and Challenges
The basic problem we address is: given a dual-radio mesh
network, how does a distributed protocol assign channels
and select routes that achieve high end-to-end performance?
The channel assignment challenge: Multi-radio
networks achieve high performance by assigning non-
overlapping channels to eliminate harmful intra-path inter-
ference and reduce inter-path interference whenever possi-
ble. For a single multi-hop path, one can easily assign chan-
nels to eliminate intra-path interference: each forwarder uses
two distinct channels to communicate with its previous and
next hop neighbor. Channel assignment becomes much more
challenging if it is to reduce interference for all paths under
arbitrary traﬃc patterns, since each node has only a few ra-
dios (two in our case), far fewer than the number of available
non-overlapping channels.
Most prior proposals either use a centralized assignment
algorithm or require all nodes to operate one of its radios
on a common channel. Unfortunately, neither approach is
satisfactory. Centralized algorithms without the use of a
common channel cannot adapt robustly to cope with net-

work changes. Assigning a common channel to all nodes
maximizes network connectivity but causes half of all links
to operate on the same channel (the common channel), re-
sulting in increased intra and inter-path interference. For a
mesh network that provides Internet access to many clients,
we can exploit the predominant traﬃc pattern to optimize
the performance of gateway paths only. To do so, a multi-
radio protocol should jointly choose gateway paths and chan-
nel assignments to ensure that each gateway path consists
of high quality links operating on distinct channels and that
paths to diﬀerent gateways use diﬀerent available channels
whenever possible.
Routing challenges: Since intra-path interference is un-
likely with careful channel assignment, the throughput of
a multi-hop path in multi-radio networks is limited by its
worst performing link. It is diﬃcult to estimate link qual-
ity: not only are links lossy, but loss rates also vary across
diﬀerent timescales [3, 12]. Figure 2 characterizes the link
delivery ratios in our 24-node testbed on channel 6 (2.437
GHz). The delivery ratio of a link is the fraction of suc-
cessfully received broadcast packets during one second. 20
measurements were taken for each link over a duration of
20 seconds. Figure 2 plots the distribution of the median
delivery ratio with error bars at 20% and 80%. As shown in
the graph, the delivery ratio of many links ﬂuctuates over
a short time period. Such ﬂuctuations can lead to subopti-
mal routes and unnecessary route changes. In addition to
loss variations, practical mesh deployments have to share
the 2.4 GHz frequency band with many types of popular
devices (for example, cordless telephones) and potentially,
a large number of access points. As a result, there is often
signiﬁcant external competition for the channel.
Ignoring
such competing traﬃc result in paths that under-perform.
3. THE DESIGN OF ROMA
In this section, we introduce the design of ROMA (Rout-
ing over Multi-radio Access Network), a distributed protocol
that chooses routing path and channel assignment together
to optimize the path throughput between every node and a
few gateways. We ﬁrst motivate the basic idea of ROMA
before describing its design details.
3.1 The simpliﬁed scenario
We discuss ROMA’s main idea in a simpliﬁed setup where
the network has a single gateway with one radio and all other
nodes have two radios. In the simpliﬁed case, ROMA aims
to assign channels to eliminate intra-path interference for all
routing paths to a single gateway radio (similar to [32]). In
the single gateway radio case, inter-path interference is not
an issue since competing ﬂows contend for the same gateway
resource. In the multiple gateway case, ROMA also aims to
reduce inter-path interference for paths destined to diﬀerent
gateway radios (Section 3.5).
With a single gateway, we can view all nodes as residing
on diﬀerent levels based on their path length to the gateway.
Intuitively, the network forms a ring-like pattern emanating
