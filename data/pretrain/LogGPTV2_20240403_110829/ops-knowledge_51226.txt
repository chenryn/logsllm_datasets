User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Xen DomU root filesystems becoming read-only on iSCSI virtual IP failover My Xen servers are openSUSE 11.1 with open-iscsi to our iSCSI SAN cluster. The SAN modules are in an IP failover group behind a virtual IP that the initiators connect to.

In the event that the primary SAN server goes down, the secondary picks up the role of serving as the target. This is all handled by the LeftHand SAN/iQ software and works well in most situations.

The problem I have is that occasionally some of my Xen DomUs will have their root filesystem go read-only after an IP failover. It's not consistent, and happens to a different subset each time a failover occurs. They're all running the same openSUSE 11.1 software image.

The root filesystems for each DomU are mounted by open-iscsi in the Dom0 and then Xen uses the standard block device driver to expose it to the DomU.

The exact symptom is that as a root as running touch /test returns the error "read-only filesystem". However, the output of mount shows it as being mounted read-write. Of course, all other I/O on the domU is also failing at this time so the machine comes down hard. Simply restarting it with xm from the Dom0 without even reconnecting the iSCSI session makes everything work again.

On the Dom0 side the syslog messages during the fail-over are something like the following:

kernel: connection1:0: iscsi: detected conn error (1011)
iscsid: Kernel reported iSCSI connection 1:0 error (1011) state (3)
iscsid: connection1:0 is operational after recovery (1 attempts) 


I'm having a hard time figuring out at what layer to debug this problem, is it something in the DomU kernel? or at the Dom0 or Xen level? I think there's likely some parameter somewhere that needs tweaking to increase some kind of timeout, but I'm not sure where to look.

I don't really think it is an issue with open-iscsi simply because the connected block device is still readable and writeable from the Dom0.

Assistant: I eventually solved this by using the following advice and settings from the open-iscsi documentation:

8.2 iSCSI settings for iSCSI root
---------------------------------

When accessing the root parition directly through a iSCSI disk, the
iSCSI timers should be set so that iSCSI layer has several chances to try to
re-establish a session and so that commands are not quickly requeued to
the SCSI layer. Basically you want the opposite of when using dm-multipath.

For this setup, you can turn off iSCSI pings by setting:

node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_interval = 0
node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_timeout = 0

And you can turn the replacement_timer to a very long value:

node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout = 86400


After setting up the connection to each LUN as described above, the failover works like a charm, even if it takes several minutes to happen.
