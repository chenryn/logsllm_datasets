User: I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS; python 2.7.3 is pre-installed.
A bug in python 2.7 distribution has been fixed in their repository.
changeset 76420:ab9d6c4907e7 2.7
How do I apply this patch on my PC ?  
Thanks,
Vineet
Assistant: Unless you are running a custom-compiled version of Python that you pulled from the cvs server (which I'm pretty sure you are not), the best thing to do is to wait until an official build is provided by the Ubuntu packagers. Also, since this bug was found on Apr 19, 2012 and hasn't been bundled into Python 2.7's tarball, it isn't a critical bug.
In short, either compile Python from the repository (not recommended), patch the Python library files yourself (they're just Python files, but I wouldn't edit them), or just put up with this cryptic bug that doesn't really affect anyone.
I wouldn't worry about it. If it was critical, Python 2.7.4 would've been released with this patch.
