determine outputs

Memory and Programmable Logic 3
 Security fuses and boot-block protection
– Enabled for "write-once" access to a memory area or 
to prevent full read back
– Usually implemented in any decent design
– Might be bypassed with die analysis attacks (FIB) or 
electrical faults [7]
– Ex.: PIC16C84 attack in which security bit is removed 
by increasing VCC during repeated write accesses

Chip Decapping and Die Analysis
 Analysis of Integrated Circuit (IC) dies is typically 
the most difficult area for hardware hacking
 With access to the IC die, you can:
– Retrieve contents of Flash, ROM, FPGAs, other non-
volatile devices (firmware and crypto keys stored here)
– Modify or destroy gates and other silicon structures 
(e.g., reconnect a security fuse that prevents reading 
of the device)

Chip Decapping and Die Analysis 2
 The good thing is that IC designers make 
mistakes, so tools are needed
– Failure analysis
– Chip repair and inspection
 What tools?
– Chip Decappers
– Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
– Voltage Contrast Microscopy
– Focused Ion Beam (FIB)

Chip Decapping and Die Analysis 3
 Equipment available on the used/surplus market
 Access to tools in most any large academic 
institution
 Reverse engineering and analysis services exist 
(still high priced, $10k-$20k)
– Can provide functional investigation, extraction, IC 
simulation, analyze semiconductor processes, etc.
– Ex.: Semiconductor Insights (www.semiconductor.com) 
and Chipworks (www.chipworks.com)

Chip Decapping and Die Analysis:
IC Decapsulation
 Decapsulation tools used to "delid" or "decap" the 
top of the IC housing
 Uses chemical or mechanical means (or both)
 Will keep the silicon die intact while removing the 
outer material
 Ex.: Nippon Scientific (www.nscnet.co.jp/e), 
Nisene Technology Group (www.nisene.com), 
ULTRA TEC Manufacturing (www.ultratecusa. 
com), approx. $30k new, $15k used

Chip Decapping and Die Analysis:
Scanning Electron Microscope
 Used to perform sub-micron inspection of the 
physical die
 Metal or other material layers might need to be 
de-processed before access to gate structures
 Depending on ROM size and properties, can 
visually recreate contents

Chip Decapping and Die Analysis:
Voltage Contrast Microscopy
 Detect variances of voltages and display them as 
contrast images
– Performed with a SEM
 Ex.: Could extract information from a Flash ROM 
storage cell

Chip Decapping and Die Analysis:
Focused Ion Beams
 Send a focused stream of ions onto the surface 
of the chip
– Beam current and optional use of gas/vapor changes 
the function
 Cutting
– Ex.: Cut a bond pad or trace from the die ($1k-$10k)
 Deposition
– Ex.: Add a jumper/reconnect a trace on the die ($1k-
$10k)

Emissions and Side-Channel Attacks
 All devices leak information
– EMI (electromagnetic interference) from circuits 
(TEMPEST) [8, 9]
– Power supply fluctuations
– Visible radiation from LEDs and monitors [10, 11]
 Can be monitored and used by attacker to 
determine secret information
 Devices may also be susceptible to RF or ESD 
(immunity)
– Intentionally injected to cause failure
44
© 2004 Grand Idea Studio, Inc.
Emissions and Side-Channel Attacks:
Power Supply
 Simple Power Analysis (SPA)
– Attacker directly observes power consumption
– Varies based on microprocessor operation
– Easy to identify intensive functions (cryptographic)
 Differential Power Analysis (DPA) [12]
– Advanced mathematical methods to determine secret 
information on a device
45
© 2004 Grand Idea Studio, Inc.
Clock and Timing
 Attacks rely on changing or measuring timing 
characteristics of the system
 Active (Invasive) timing attacks
– Vary clock (speed up or slow down) to induce failure or 
unintended operation
 Passive timing attacks
– Non-invasive measurements of computation time
– Different tasks take different amounts of time
16

 "Security through obscurity" does not work
– Provides a false sense of security to designers/users
– Might temporarily discourage an attacker, but it only 
takes one to discover it
 Weak tactics to look out for when hacking 
"secure" hardware products:
– Encoded forms of fixed data
– Scrambled address lines through extra logic
– Intentionally messy/lousy code
– Spurious and meaningless data ("signal decoys")
Security Through Obscurity
47
© 2004 Grand Idea Studio, Inc.
 Advances in chip packaging
– Ultra-fine pitch and chip-scale packaging (e.g., 
BGA, COB, CIB)
– Not as easy to access pins/connections to probe
– Discrete components can now easily be inhaled
 Highly-integrated chips (sub-micron)
– Difficult, but not impossible, to probe and modify
 High speed boards
– Processor and memory bus > hundreds of MHz
– Serial bus speeds approaching Gigabit/sec.
Hardware Hacking Challenges
48
© 2004 Grand Idea Studio, Inc.
 Cost of equipment
– Advanced tools still beyond the reach of average 
hobbyist (probing, decapping, SEMs, etc.)
– "State of the art" defined by what hackers can find in 
the trash and at swapmeets
 Societal pressures
– Hardware hacking is practically mainstream, but 
"hacker" is still a naughty word

Conclusions
 Hardware hacking is approaching a mainstream 
activity
 Plays an important role in the balance between 
consumers and corporations (e.g., The Man)
 Think as a designer would
 Nothing is ever 100% secure
– Given enough time, resources, and motivation, you 
can break anything
 The possibilities are endless
 Have fun!
