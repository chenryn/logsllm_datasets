### Comprehensive Guide to Hardware Hacking

#### 1. Input-Output Analysis
- **Objective**: Cycle through all possible combinations of inputs to determine corresponding outputs.
- **Security Fuses and Boot-Block Protection**:
  - **Functionality**: These features enable "write-once" access to a memory area or prevent full read-back.
  - **Implementation**: Typically included in well-designed systems.
  - **Vulnerabilities**: Can be bypassed using die analysis attacks (e.g., Focused Ion Beam, FIB) or electrical faults.
  - **Example**: In the PIC16C84 attack, the security bit is removed by increasing VCC during repeated write accesses.

#### 9. Power Supply Analysis
- **Simple Power Analysis (SPA)**:
  - **Method**: Direct observation of power consumption.
  - **Variation**: Based on microprocessor operation.
  - **Detection**: Easy to identify intensive functions (e.g., cryptographic operations).

  - **Method**: Advanced mathematical techniques to determine secret information.
  - **Reference**: [12] P. Kocher, J. Jaffe, and B. Jun, "Overview of Differential Power Analysis."

#### 10. Clock and Timing
- **Timing Attacks**:
  - **Active (Invasive)**: Vary clock speed to induce failure or unintended operation.
  - **Passive (Non-Invasive)**: Measure computation time to infer different tasks.

#### 11. Security Through Obscurity
- **Effectiveness**: Does not provide robust security.
  - **False Sense of Security**: Temporarily discourages attackers but is easily discovered.
- **Weak Tactics**:
  - Encoded forms of fixed data
  - Scrambled address lines through extra logic
  - Intentionally messy/lousy code
  - Spurious and meaningless data ("signal decoys")

#### 12. Challenges in Hardware Hacking
- **Advances in Chip Packaging**:
  - **Ultra-fine Pitch and Chip-Scale Packaging**: BGA, COB, CIB.
  - **Probing Difficulty**: Harder to access pins/connections.
- **Highly-Integrated Chips**:
  - **Sub-Micron Technology**: Difficult, but not impossible, to probe and modify.
- **High-Speed Boards**:
  - **Processor and Memory Bus**: Hundreds of MHz.
  - **Serial Bus Speeds**: Approaching Gigabit/sec.

#### 13. Cost and Societal Pressures
- **Equipment Costs**:
  - **Advanced Tools**: Beyond the reach of average hobbyists.
  - **State of the Art**: Defined by what hackers can find in the trash and at swap meets.
- **Societal Pressures**:
  - **Mainstream Acceptance**: Hardware hacking is becoming mainstream, but the term "hacker" remains stigmatized.

#### 14. Conclusions
