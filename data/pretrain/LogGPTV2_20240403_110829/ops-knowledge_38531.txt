User: How can I retrieve a list of tasks in a queue that are yet to be processed?
Assistant: As far as I know Celery does not give API for examining tasks that are waiting in the queue. This is broker-specific. If you use Redis as a broker for an example, then examining tasks that are waiting in the celery (default) queue is as simple as:

connect to the broker
list items in the celery list (LRANGE command for an example)

Keep in mind that these are tasks WAITING to be picked by available workers. Your cluster may have some tasks running - those will not be in this list as they have already been picked.
The process of retrieving tasks in particular queue is broker-specific.
