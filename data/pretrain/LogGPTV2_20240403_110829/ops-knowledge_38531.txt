To retrieve a list of tasks in a queue that are yet to be processed, you need to interact with the message broker used by Celery, as Celery itself does not provide a direct API for examining unprocessed tasks. The method to do this varies depending on the specific broker you are using. 

For example, if you are using Redis as your broker, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Broker:**
   Establish a connection to your Redis instance.

2. **List Items in the Queue:**
   Use Redis commands to inspect the queue. For instance, you can use the `LRANGE` command to list the tasks in the default Celery queue. This command will return the tasks that are currently waiting to be picked up by available workers.

Here is an example of how you might do this in Python using the `redis` library:

```python
import redis

# Connect to Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# List items in the 'celery' queue
tasks = r.lrange('celery', 0, -1)

# Print the tasks
for task in tasks:
    print(task)
```

**Important Notes:**
- The tasks retrieved using this method are those that are still waiting to be picked up by workers. Tasks that are already being processed by workers will not appear in this list.
- The process of retrieving tasks from a queue is specific to the broker you are using. If you are using a different broker (e.g., RabbitMQ), the commands and methods will differ.

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor and manage the tasks in your Celery queue.
