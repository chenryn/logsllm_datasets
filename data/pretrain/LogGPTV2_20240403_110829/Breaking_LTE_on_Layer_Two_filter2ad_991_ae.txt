component, where the ﬁrst triggers the parameter guessing on
MAC layer. The user data is simply forwarded on the PDCP
layer and passed on the downlink and uplink into the ALTER
component of the UE component. The ALTER component
ﬁrst distinguishes DNS trafﬁc from other trafﬁc and, second,
modiﬁes the message by applying the manipulation mask if
needed. The ALTER component returns the modiﬁed and the
unmodiﬁed packets to the normal packet path. Especially,
packets in the uplink direction are sent to the network and
packets in the downlink direction are sent to the UE. For our
example, we use hard-coded values of the PDCP length for
identifying the DNS requests of the domain example.org
to our malicious DNS server.
D. Results
For the preparation of the experiments, we set the victim
phone into ﬂight mode, delete all caches (DNS and HTTP) via
an ADB command, and place it in the shielding box. After
starting the malicious relay, we disable the ﬂight mode and
wait for the successful radio layer connection to our relay.
From then on, our malicious relay forwards all messages on
UE (in shielding box)

network.
Over an ADB command, we instruct the phone to visit the
website example.org. The following transmissions trigger
the message classiﬁer in our malicious relay and we identify
a DNS request according to its PDCP length. In the next step,
we apply the manipulation mask for replacing the original
DNS server address with the malicious destination and emit
the altered packet. Consequently, the DNS request is redirected
to our rogue DNS server, which accepts the request despite its
invalid UDP checksum. The malicious DNS server performs
the DNS spooﬁng attack and responds with the wrong IP
address for example.org. On the downlink, we identify the
DNS response and apply the manipulation mask to change
the source IP address,
thus it matches the original IP of
the DNS server. Finally, the phone receives the reply packet
and connects to the spoofed IP address to perform a HTTP
GET request, resulting in loading the wrong website content.

E. Discussion
ALTER exploits the speciﬁcation ﬂaw of missing integrity
protection of user data and has consequences for all LTE users.
In the following, we discuss the real-world applicability of
ALTER and possible countermeasures.
Real-World Application. We have demonstrated the feasibil-
ity of ALTER using a controlled experimental lab setup. We
use a shielding box to prevent our relay from interfering with
the commercial network in the licensed spectrum, following
ethics guidelines. Further, the shielding box stabilizes the UE’s
radio connection and prevents non-deterministic behavior of
the relay. In other words, the shielding box setup assures that
the UE does not connect to any other available cell and the
malicious relay does not interfere with itself. While we use
this to simplify the experimental procedure, the setup is com-
parable to IMSI catcher attacks when considering the victim’s
perspective. Such attacks were conducted successfully in real-
world environments, i. e., without shielding equipment [2], [4].
Furthermore, the DNS redirection attack is limited to plain
IP trafﬁc. All security measures taken by upper layer protocols
cannot be circumvented, e. g., the proper use of DNSSEC or
TLS assures the authenticity of the requested server. While
DNS spooﬁng attacks are well-known in different contexts,
e. g., DNS spooﬁng on the Internet depends on the adversarial
control of one router, we emphasize the impact of an LTE
instantiation. We argue it is even easier to conduct the attack
because the accessible radio link is fundamentally more vul-
nerable to interception than other media [30].
Detection Methods. We discuss two perspectives for potential
countermeasures: ALTER can either be detected on the UE
side or within the commercial network.
As ALTER deploys a malicious relay on layer two, the
general attack setup is comparable to classical rogue base
station attacks. However, such attacks are detectable through
incorrect protocol behavior, e. g., rogue base stations enforce
the downgrade to insecure mobile generations [3]. In contrast,
the malicious relay of ALTER forwards all messages between
the UE and the benign eNodeB. Hence, the proper functioning
of all protocols (including the correct integrity protection of
control messages) is assured at all times. Consequently, the
transmission behavior is as expected and the attack cannot be
detected due to protocol anomalies. We argue that the relay
integrates—to the best of our knowledge—in a non-detectable
way into the existing network infrastructure.
While the malicious relay acts according to the speciﬁcation
on the radio layer, our alteration of destination IP addresses
might induce anomalies in overlying levels of the network
stack. In particular, our injected addresses differ from common
DNS servers. One possible way of detection would be the use
of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), even though this also holds
the risk for false positive detections since a user might have
set a custom DNS server.
Potential Countermeasure. Even though the LTE Authen-
tication and Key Agreement (AKA) is formally proven se-
cure [31],
this attack is still possible due to the lack of
integrity protection of user plane data. We argue that the only
way to mitigate this attack sustainably is to use authenticated
encryption for the user plane. While different suitable schemes
exist like AES-GCM (AES-Galois/Counter Mode), we focus
on the MAC-then-Encrypt scheme that is already used for
the integrity protection of the control plane. We assume that
this scheme has the highest potential for being adopted in the
speciﬁcation.
In prior decisions, this was neglected in the speciﬁcation
process due to the additional overhead on the radio layer [12].
The considered worst case scenario assumes small packet
lengths of 45 byte on average,
the corresponding 4 byte
Message Authentication Code (MAC) would, therefore, lead
to an overhead of 8.9 %.
Our empirical measurements conducted in the context of
the website ﬁngerprinting attack reveal an overhead of 0.63 %
for an average packet
length of 634.15 byte for over 18
billion packets. In practice, packet lengths hence seem to differ
signiﬁcantly from the above assumption for the use case of
web browsing. The overhead for integrity protection seems
to be acceptable when considering the security and privacy
impact of ALTER. In the light of the next mobile generation,
we hope that we can inﬂuence the speciﬁcation process to add
mandatory user plane integrity protection to 5G.
Disclosure Process and Integrity Protection in 5G. As stated
before, we have contacted the GSMA following the guidelines
of responsible disclosure. The GSMA informed the network
providers and issued a liaison statement to inform the 3GPP
speciﬁcation body about the problem [32]. The 3GPP security
group evaluated possible actions for LTE and the upcoming
5G speciﬁcation and composed a statement regarding the
attack [33], [34].
The security group “feels that 5G standalone security ar-
chitecture is in reasonable shape in respect of this attack,

but early implementations may have limited support for UP
integrity.” [34]. More precisely, the 5G speciﬁes user plane
integrity protection as optional [35]. However, for a successful
protection against ALTER, the network needs to be conﬁgured
correctly and the UE must support it. We argue that only
mandatory integrity protection in 5G is a sustainable coun-
termeasure.
work, we identify the following differences. First, we have
demonstrated the attack on a commercial network. Further,
we found out that a simple downlink sniffer is in 91.75 % the
cases sufﬁcient to map the more volatile RNTI with a TMSI.
Also, we cannot only identify and localize users within a cell
but use the scheduling information of the mapped RNTI as a
starting point for the website ﬁngerprinting attack.
V. RELATED WORK
B. Website Fingerprinting
In the following, we discuss related work in the context of
identity mapping attacks, website ﬁngerprinting, and user data
manipulation attacks.
A. Identity Mapping
Prior attacks in the context of identity mapping either link
the user’s TMSI to public identities like phone numbers or
decode the more volatile RNTI of a session. Learning such
individual identities enables an adversary to track and localize
users within a cell, harming especially their privacy.
TMSI Linking. Paging attacks exploit the broadcast wake-
up procedure of mobile networks towards idle user devices.
Such broadcasts include the individual TMSI of a user,
they can be eavesdropped easily, and actively triggering the
procedure helps the attacker to learn sensitive information.
Kune et al. [15] presented a paging attack in the context
of GSM, where the attacker learns the user’s TMSI from
repeatedly calling the known phone number. The calls trigger
the transmission of the TMSI and the attacker can recognize
the repeated occurrence of one TMSI. Shaik et al. [2] port the
paging attack to LTE and exploit Facebook and Whatsapp typ-
ing notiﬁcations rather than the phone number as a trigger for
the paging procedure. One potential countermeasure against
paging attacks is a frequent TMSI reallocation. While this re-
allocation should protect from the identiﬁcation and location of
users, Hong et al. [16] showed that lack of randomness in the
reallocation scheme renders this countermeasure insufﬁcient.
The work above focuses solely on the TMSI, which is an
upper layer identiﬁer. In contrast, we map the radio layer
identity (RNTI) to the TMSI and, therefore, let the identity
mapping attack serve as a stepping stone for follow-up attacks.
RNTI Decoding. While TMSIs can be exploited for the
identiﬁcation and localization of users, RNTI decoding by
now was only proposed in the context of performance and
interference optimizations. Kumar et al. [36] showed that they
could passively decode the RNTI, map it to radio resource
allocations, and locate a phone by using radar techniques for
optimizing the LTE radio layer. Commercial LTE downlink
sniffers [37], [38] are capable of decoding a list of all active
RNTIs and monitoring the downlink trafﬁc. Bui et al. [39],
[40] presented an open source downlink sniffer also based
on the srsLTE stack. While those approaches are technically
comparable to ours, our contribution focuses on showing the
vulnerability of the LTE downlink trafﬁc.
Most similar to the presented attack is the work by Jover [3]
in which the author describes the possibility of mapping a
phone number or TMSI to an RNTI. In compaarison to this
Website ﬁngerprinting attacks are especially known from
anonymity networks such as Tor, where the attacker learns
the destination of connections through Tor from analyzing
encrypted user trafﬁc. Recent attacks utilize Naive Bayes
classiﬁers [41] or Support Vector Machines [19], [42] and
achieve high classiﬁcation success rates, especially for closed-
world scenarios. While website ﬁngerprinting on Tor trafﬁc is
a well-established research ﬁeld, we are the ﬁrst to present a
comparable attack on radio layer LTE trafﬁc. Consequently, we
provide the ﬁrst proof of concept in a closed-world scenario
and leave more sophisticated setups [9] to future work.
Furthermore, trafﬁc analysis attacks were analyzed in the
context of wireless sensor networks, where trafﬁc patterns
might leak the geographical locations of nodes in the networks.
Attackers can exploit this information for launching attacks
against base stations of the networks [43]. Countermeasures
against trafﬁc analysis attacks comprise network coding and
homomorphic encryption [44], random path selection [45],
or classical countermeasures like mixing and dummy packet
injection [46].
In our website ﬁngerprinting attack, we exploit the PDCP
lengths using dynamic time warping. Classical countermea-
sures like dummy packet injection and mixing would induce
an enormous performance overhead, as they add a high rate
of additional trafﬁc or add artiﬁcial delays to a transmission.
Encryption is applied in LTE, but it does not obfuscate the
PDCP lengths meta information that we exploit in our attack.
C. ALTER: User Data Manipulation
The challenges for conducting the user data manipulation
attack are related to three individual research areas. First,
we depend on a malicious relay, e. g., acting as a rogue
base station towards the user. Second, our relay acts as an
unauthenticated user towards the commercial network. Finally,
we break the conﬁdentiality aim of LTE as we are able to
eavesdrop DNS requests and following connections.
Attacking the User. Rogue Base Stations simulate a benign
network and try to lure a victim into its cell, e. g., for deploying
an IMSI catcher. Such IMSI catchers help to learn the long-
term identiﬁer of a user, perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack,
and localize the user’s phone within the cell. In the context of
LTE, Mjølsnes et al. [4] demonstrated how to build a rogue
base station using existing open-source software stacks and
performed an IMSI catching attack. Nevertheless, LTE offers
mutual authentication and prevents the UE from continuing
the connection to a malicious node after the authentication
procedure was performed. Hussain et al. [47] describe the

possibility of an authentication relay attack,
in which the
AKA procedure is relayed between a commercial phone
and network. Similar to the authentication relay attack, the
presented malicious LTE Man-in-the-Middle relays the LTE
AKA messages in a ﬁrst step to establish mutual authentication
between the commercial phone and network. Another way of
deploying a MitM was presented by Rupprecht et al. [48],
where an implementation ﬂaw of the baseband let the UE
connect to a malicious network despite mutual authentication.
The activity of rogue base stations can be detected through
dedicated static or mobile sensor networks [10], [11], [49].
Rogue base station detection apps, like Snoopsnitch [50], are
unable to identify certain attacks, as the baseband hides crucial
information for the detection [51].
The malicious relay in our ALTER attack differs from
conventional rogue base stations in one fundamental charac-
teristic: As we relay all messages except for DNS requests,
the relay does not interfere with any protocol and a stable
connection is maintained during the attack.
Attacking the Network. In contrast to the use of rogue base
stations, attacks can also target the LTE network itself. One
example for this is the circumvention of a provider’s billing
mechanism, where the attacker sends malicious data to the
network, e. g., by performing IP spooﬁng [52]. Other attacks
emphasize the unreliability of the VoLTE billing mechanism
and vulnerabilities in its routing mechanisms [53], [54]. Both
classes of attacks depend on a successful authentication to-
wards the LTE network and only interfere with the IP layer
and above; however, these limitations do not apply to the set of
layer two attacks presented in this work. Other active attacks
exploit the pre-authentication trafﬁc towards the network and
deny the service for a victim. In particular, Raza et al. describe
an attack allowing an attacker to detach a victim from the
network as soon as he knows the user identity [55]. We do
not depend on a similar exploit of pre-authentication trafﬁc,
as we successfully relay all layer two messages of the original
transmission.
