User: Several processes with the same name are running on host. What is the cross-platform way to get PIDs of those processes by name using python or jython?

I want something like pidof but in python. (I don't have pidof anyway.)
I can't parse /proc because it might be unavailable (on HP-UX).
I do not want to run os.popen('ps') and parse the output because I think it is ugly (field sequence may be different in different OS).
Target platforms are Solaris, HP-UX, and maybe others.
Assistant: I don't think you will be able to find a purely python-based, portable solution without using /proc or command line utilities, at least not in python itself. Parsing os.system is not ugly - someone has to deal with the multiple platforms, be it you or someone else. Implementing it for the OS you are interested in should be fairly easy, honestly.
