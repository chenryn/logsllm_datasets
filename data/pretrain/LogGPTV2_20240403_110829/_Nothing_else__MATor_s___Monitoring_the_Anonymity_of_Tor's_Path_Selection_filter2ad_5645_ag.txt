### 6.2 Path Selection Strategies

The bandwidth of Tor nodes is not uniformly distributed, as Tor aims to improve its performance by selecting nodes based on their available bandwidth. As a result, a node with twice the bandwidth is twice as likely to be selected for a circuit. In reality, however, the bandwidth distribution is highly skewed, with some nodes being several hundred times more likely to be chosen than others (see Figure 10). Consequently, a small number of high-bandwidth nodes are used in a large percentage of circuits. If these high-bandwidth nodes are compromised or if an adversary introduces similar high-bandwidth nodes into the network, they can deanonymize a significant portion of the traffic. 

To address this issue, we propose DISTRIBUTOR, a novel path selection algorithm that distributes the trust among exit and entry nodes as evenly as possible.

#### Preparing the Weights

#### Impact of Port Choice on Recipient Anonymity
**Figure 14** shows the impact of the choice of ports on recipient anonymity, with ε = 0. The graph depicts the value for δ depending on the number of compromised nodes (0 to 50), comparing all settings against HTTPS only (port 443).

### 6.3 Lessons Learned

#### Advantages of DistribuTor over PSTor
Our DISTRIBUTOR algorithm significantly improves sender anonymity and moderately enhances recipient anonymity in all experiments. The moderate improvement in recipient anonymity is expected due to the inherent bottleneck in exit bandwidth. However, the improvement in sender anonymity is more substantial (see Figure 11). Since the re-balancing path selection algorithm does not affect Tor's overall performance, it provides a way to enhance anonymity guarantees at virtually no cost.

#### Change in Anonymity Guarantees Over Time
Our monitors also allow us to analyze how anonymity guarantees vary over time. These variations are influenced by changes in the number of available servers, their bandwidth, and their exit policies. **Figure 12** illustrates how the guarantees change over the course of a month (February 2014).

#### Long-Term Anonymity Guarantees
A long-term study analyzed the guarantees over the last 24 months (see Section 2, Figure 1). The graph was smoothed by computing the average anonymity for each day to improve readability. Interestingly, the guarantees have improved slightly over time, even though the adversary is allowed to compromise a fixed percentage of nodes, which increases as the Tor network grows.

#### Anonymity Guarantees Depending on Ports
The ports requested by the user significantly impact (recipient) anonymity guarantees. **Figure 14** shows the recipient anonymity guarantees depending on the number of compromised nodes for February 5th, with a multiplicative value of ε = 0, and without guards or restrictions to fast or stable nodes.

### 6.4 The Impact of a Multiplicative Factor

The definition of ANOA introduces a multiplicative factor in addition to the normal additive factor, allowing for the accounting of various events where an adversary might gain information, even leading to a non-negligible advantage without overestimating these events.

Experiments show that such a factor often plays a minor role, as the probability of completely deanonymizing a user is higher than the probability of just learning some information about them. For recipient anonymity, where the ISP of the user is assumed to be compromised, the probability of choosing specific entry nodes varies for different ports. For PSTor, an adversary that compromises no (or very few) nodes can have a non-negligible advantage in guessing the port, expressed either by a multiplicative factor and a δ of zero or by a non-negligible δ (see Figure 16). For DISTRIBUTOR, the value for δ does not reach zero due to the redistribution of exit bandwidth, introducing a small distinguishing event where the adversary can win without compromising nodes.

### 7 Conclusion & Future Work

This work presents MATOR, a framework for rigorously assessing the degree of anonymity in the Tor network. We address the impact of user anonymity by considering real-life characteristics of Tor, such as its path selection algorithm, consensus data, and user preferences. The anonymity assessment is derived from a theoretical framework for anonymous communication networks. We extended the ANOA framework to suit our needs and developed the first real-time anonymity monitor using MATOR and Tor's publicly available data. Based on our experiments, we propose the DISTRIBUTOR path selection algorithm, which provides stronger anonymity guarantees without decreasing Tor's overall performance.

Future work includes integrating MATOR into the actual Tor code and modeling the recently proposed congestion-aware path selection algorithm, which improves performance but reduces anonymity. Additionally, we plan to apply the MATOR framework to Tor hidden services, enabling automatic disconnection from Tor when anonymity bounds drop below a certain threshold.
