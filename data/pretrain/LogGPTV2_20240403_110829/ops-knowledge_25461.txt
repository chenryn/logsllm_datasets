User: I'd like to have a Python program start listening on port 80, but after that execute without root permissions. Is there a way to drop root or to get port 80 without it?
Assistant: systemd can do it for you, if you start your program through systemd, systemd can hand off the already-open listening socket to it, and it can also activate your program on first connection.  and you don't even need to daemonize it.
If you are going to go with the standalone approach, you need the capability CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE (check capabilities man page).  This can be done on a program-by-program basis with the correct command line tool, or by making your application (1) be suid root (2) start up (3) listen to the port (4) drop privileges / capabilities immediately.

Remember that suid root programs come with lots of security considerations (clean and secure environment, umask, privileges, rlimits, all those things are things that your program is going to have to set up correctly).  If you can use something like systemd, all the better then.
