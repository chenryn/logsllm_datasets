## Introduction
"Because that's where the money is."
- Willie Sutton, Bank Robber

### Security Inconsistency
Why does my bank website require my 2-factor token, but pulling my transactions into Quicken does not?

## Personal Threat Model
### Assets
- Checking account
- Brokerage account

### Threats
- Credentials are stolen
- Accounts are accessible without credentials
- @mrvaughan: [Video Explanation](https://youtu.be/PIwvxSZj5e8)

## Lack of Least Privilege
- Users have one set of bank credentials.
- Full read/write access to all accounts at the financial institution.
- Plain text password is shared with and stored by aggregators.
- Tokenized application-based access control (OAuth) is needed.

## OFX Protocol Specification
### OFX 1.0.x
- **1.0.2 (1997)**

  - User:Pass sent in plaintext over HTTPS
  - Suggests SSN for username
  - SGML
- **1.0.3 (2006)**
  - Added “MFA”

### OFX 2.x.x
- **2.0.3 (2006)**
  - BASIC authentication
  - User:Pass sent in plaintext over HTTPS
  - Added “MFA”
  - XML
  - Taxes (1099, W2)
- **2.2.0 (2017)**
  - Token-based Authentication
  - OAuth

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
#### Know
- Password
- PIN
- Security Question

#### Have
- Token
- Hardware
- Software
- PKI Certificate
- Smart Card

#### Are
- Biometric
- Behavior

### 2-Step Authentication
- Password + out-of-band mechanism
- 6-digit string
- SMS
- Push notification
- Software token

### OFX “MFA”
#### Security Question
- Free form field required by server
- Server defines label (e.g., "Mother’s maiden name.")
- Hard-coded list (e.g., "Favorite color.")

#### Static String
- Client-generated ID checked by the server (TOFU)
- Static
- Server-generated, provided to client out-of-band
- Implied static, could be used for 2-step auth

### Frequency of OFX Header: Version
- 102: 76%
- 103: 20%
- 202: 4%
- 203: 0%

### Statistics
- 7,000 OFX FIs
- 2,000 Public OFX FIs
- 400 Public Servers
- 15,000 FIs
- 7,000 Commercial Banks (USA & Canada)

## Investigation
### OFX Survey
- What FIs are running an OFX server?
- Find them and talk to them.
- What software is providing this service?
- Ask them simple questions.

### Recon
- ENUM HOSTS
- TLS PING
- WEB SERVER
