Degrees, Lengths, and Euler’s Formula
Theorem 1 (“Handshaking”): In a graph with e edges, the sum of
the degrees of all vertices is 2e.
(Reason: Every edge contributes to the degrees of two vertices.)
Theorem 2: In a planar graph with e edges, the sum of the
lengths of all faces is 2e.
 In a planar graph, each face has length 3 or greater, so
2e ≥ 3f , so f ≤ 2e/3.
 By Euler’s formula, v − e + f = 2 ≤ v − e + 2e/3 = v − e/3.
 Applying a little algebra to 2 ≤ v − e/3 gives us e ≤ 3v − 6.

The Six-Color Theorem
Theorem
Every planar graph can be colored with 6 or fewer colors.
Idea: Find the right order in which to color the vertices so that we
will never need more than 6 colors.
 The trick is to think about which vertex to color last.
 It should be a vertex with at most 5 neighbors.
 How do we know G has such a vertex?

The Six-Color Theorem
Suppose G is a planar graph.
 If every vertex of G has degree 6 or greater, then the sum of
degrees would be at least 6v, and there would be at least 3v
edges.
 But this is impossible since e ≤ 3v − 6.
 Therefore, there must be some vertex whose degree is 5 or
less. (In fact, there will be many choices — but we only need
one.)
This is the vertex we are going to color last.
Find a vertex of degree ≤ 5, delete it, and repeat until all vertices
are deleted.

Successively Deleting Vertices of Degree 6 Or Less
Now color the vertices in reverse order — last deleted = first
colored.
Always use the first possible color from the palette.

Proof of the 6CT
 Each time we color a new vertex, it has at most 5 neighbors
that have already been colored.
 Therefore, at least one color from the palette is available for
every vertex.
 This method works for any planar graph — so every planar
graph is 6-colorable.
With a little work, the method can be souped up to prove that
every planar graph is 5-colorable.
(Idea: If we happen to require color #6, show that there is some
way of going back and modifying the previous coloring so that
color #6 is not really required.)

Appel and Haken’s Proof
In 1976, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, of the University of
Illinois, announced a proof of the Four-Color Theorem.
Suppose there exists a planar graph that requires more than 4
colors — the idea is to show that something impossible must then
happen.
Observation: If there is at least one such graph, then there is a
smallest such graph (i.e., with the minimum number of vertices).
Let G be a non-4-colorable planar graph that is as small as
possible (a “minimal criminal”).

Appel and Haken’s Proof
Step 1: Prove that G contains at least one of 1476 unavoidable
configurations. (To do this, assign each vertex a “charge”. Let the
electrons flow around G (according to 487 “discharging rules”). If
a vertex still has electrons that it cannot discharge, the reason
must be that there is one of those 1476 configurations nearby.)
Step 2: Prove that each one of those 1476 unavoidable
configurations is reducible — it can be replaced with something
smaller without affecting the chromatic number of G. (This part
of the proof was carried out by a computer.)
Conclusion: G was not a minimal criminal.
There is no such thing as a minimal non-4-colorable planar graph.
Therefore, there are no non-4-colorable planar graphs!

Appel and Haken, describing their proof of the 4CT:
This leaves the reader to face 50 pages containing text
and diagrams, 85 pages filled with almost 2500 additional
diagrams, and 400 microfiche pages that contain further
diagrams and thousands of individual verifications of
claims made in the 24 lemmas in the main sections of
text. In addition, the reader is told that certain facts
have been verified with the use of about twelve hundred
hours of computer time and would be extremely
time-consuming to verify by hand. The papers are
somewhat intimidating due to their style and length and
few mathematicians have read them in any detail.

Reactions to Appel and Haken’s Proof
Philosopher Thomas Tymoczko (1979):
4CT is not really a theorem. . . [N]o mathematician has
seen a proof of the 4CT, nor has any seen a proof that it
has a proof. Moreover, it is very unlikely that any
mathematician will ever see a proof of the 4CT.
Mathematician and master expositor Paul Halmos (1990):
I do not find it easy to say what we learned from all that.
Mathematician Daniel Cohen (1991):
The mission of mathematics is understanding. . .
Admitting the computer shenanigans of A&H to the
ranks of mathematics would only leave us intellectually
unfulfilled.

Mathematician Doron Zeilberger (2002):
. . . Ken Appel and Wolfgang Haken’s GORGEOUS proof
of the Four-Color Theorem. Few people are aware that it
is really a ONE-LINE Proof: ‘The following finite set of
reducible configurations, let’s call it S, is unavoidable’.
The set S itself does not have to be actually examined by
human eyes, and perhaps should not. The computer
would be much more reliable than any human in checking
its claim. . . . FOUR COLORS SUFFICE BECAUSE THE

[RSST] (1995–1997) gave an improved proof, using the same
approach as Appel and Haken, but with 1476 633 unavoidable
configurations and 487 32 discharging rules.
 The RSST proof gives a faster algorithm to explicitly compute
a 4-coloring of a planar graph

Formal Proof
Instead of using a computer to check hundreds or thousands of
cases, why not use a computer to check the proof itself?
 Teach a computer how to check logical proofs (free software
exists for this)
 Translate a proof into language understandable by the
computer (needs to be very precise!)
 In order to believe the theorem, you don’t have to check every
line of the proof — you only have to trust that the
proof-checker itself was programmed correctly.

Formal Proof
Gonthier:
The approach that proved successful for this proof was to
turn almost every mathematical concept into a data
structure or a program, thereby converting the entire
enterprise into one of program verification.
Perhaps this is the most promising aspect of formal
proof: it is not merely a method to make absolutely sure
we have not made a mistake in a proof, but also a tool
that shows us and compels us to understand why a proof
works.

Here C(G, k) = k(k − 1)(k − 2) and there are 6 AOs.

 Some special kinds of trees can be identified from their
