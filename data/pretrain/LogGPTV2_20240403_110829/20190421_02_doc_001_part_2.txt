# The Four-Color Theorem: Definitions and Examples

## Graphs and Planar Graphs
- **Graphs**: A graph is a collection of vertices (or nodes) and edges connecting these vertices.
- **Planar Graphs**: A graph is planar if it can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.

## The Solution of the Four-Color Problem: Coloring Graphs
- **The Four-Color Theorem**: Every planar graph can be colored with four or fewer colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
- **Euler’s Formula**: For any connected planar graph, \( v - e + f = 2 \), where \( v \) is the number of vertices, \( e \) is the number of edges, and \( f \) is the number of faces.

### Degrees, Lengths, and Euler’s Formula
- **Theorem 1 (Handshaking Lemma)**: In a graph with \( e \) edges, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is \( 2e \). This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices.
- **Theorem 2**: In a planar graph with \( e \) edges, the sum of the lengths of all faces is \( 2e \). Since each face has a length of at least 3, we have \( 2e \geq 3f \), which implies \( f \leq \frac{2e}{3} \).
- **Applying Euler’s Formula**: From \( v - e + f = 2 \), substituting \( f \leq \frac{2e}{3} \) gives \( 2 \leq v - e + \frac{2e}{3} = v - \frac{e}{3} \). Solving for \( e \) yields \( e \leq 3v - 6 \).

## More About Coloring Graphs
- **The Six-Color Theorem**: Every planar graph can be colored with six or fewer colors.
- **Idea**: Find an order in which to color the vertices so that no more than six colors are needed. The key is to color a vertex with at most five neighbors last.

### Proof of the Six-Color Theorem
- **Step 1**: If every vertex of a planar graph \( G \) has a degree of 6 or greater, the sum of the degrees would be at least \( 6v \), implying at least \( 3v \) edges. However, since \( e \leq 3v - 6 \), this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a vertex with a degree of 5 or less.
- **Step 2**: Delete a vertex of degree 5 or less, and repeat until all vertices are deleted. Then, color the vertices in reverse order, using the first available color from the palette.

## Appel and Haken’s Proof of the Four-Color Theorem
- **Announcement (1976)**: Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, of the University of Illinois, announced a proof of the Four-Color Theorem.
- **Key Idea**: Show that if there exists a planar graph requiring more than four colors, then something impossible must occur.

### Steps in the Proof
- **Step 1**: Prove that any non-4-colorable planar graph contains at least one of 1476 unavoidable configurations. This involves assigning charges to vertices and using discharging rules.
- **Step 2**: Prove that each of these 1476 configurations is reducible, meaning they can be replaced with smaller configurations without affecting the chromatic number. This part was carried out by a computer.
- **Conclusion**: There is no minimal non-4-colorable planar graph, thus proving the Four-Color Theorem.

## Reactions to Appel and Haken’s Proof
- **Philosopher Thomas Tymoczko (1979)**: Suggested that the 4CT is not a theorem because no mathematician has seen a complete proof.
- **Mathematician Paul Halmos (1990)**: Expressed uncertainty about the value and understanding gained from the proof.
- **Mathematician Daniel Cohen (1991)**: Criticized the use of computers in proofs, arguing that it leaves us intellectually unfulfilled.
- **Kenneth Appel (1980s)**: Defended the use of computers, stating that they were more reliable than human mathematicians.
- **Mathematician Doron Zeilberger (2002)**: Praised the proof, emphasizing the reliability of the computer in checking the configurations.

## Improvements and Formal Verification
- **Neil Robertson, Daniel Sanders, Paul Seymour, and Robin Thomas (1995–1997)**: Provided an improved proof with fewer unavoidable configurations and discharging rules.
- **Formal Proof (2005)**: Georges Gonthier published a formal proof of the 4CT, converting the proof into a form that can be checked by a computer.

## Chromatic Polynomials and Symmetric Functions
- **Chromatic Polynomial**: A polynomial \( C(G, k) \) that counts the number of proper colorings of a graph \( G \) using \( k \) or fewer colors.
- **Chromatic Symmetric Function**: A more detailed census of colorings, introduced by Richard Stanley, which counts colorings for each possible palette.

### Perfect Graphs
- **Definition**: A graph is perfect if the chromatic number equals the clique number for any induced subgraph.
- **Theorems**:
  - Lovász (1972): A graph is perfect if and only if its complement is perfect.
  - Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (2006): A graph is perfect if and only if neither the graph nor its complement has an odd hole.
