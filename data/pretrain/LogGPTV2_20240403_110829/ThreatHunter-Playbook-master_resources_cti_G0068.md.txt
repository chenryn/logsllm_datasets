| Linux, macOS, Windows | Command and Control | [Custom Command and Control Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1094/) | PLATINUM uses the Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) channel for command and control. | Packet capture, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Process use of network, Process monitoring, Host network interface, Network intrusion detection system, Network protocol analysis |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Privilege Escalation | [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068/) | PLATINUM leverages zero-day vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. | Windows Error Reporting, Process monitoring, Application logs |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation | [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/) | PLATINUM employs various methods of process injection, including hot patching. | API monitoring, Windows Registry, File monitoring, DLL monitoring, Process monitoring, Named Pipes |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Collection, Credential Access | [Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/) | PLATINUM uses several different keyloggers. | Windows Registry, Kernel drivers, Process monitoring, API monitoring |
| Windows, Linux, macOS | Command and Control | [Standard Non-Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095/) | PLATINUM uses the Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) channel for command and control. | Host network interface, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Network intrusion detection system, Network protocol analysis, Packet capture, Process use of network |
| Windows, Linux, macOS | Credential Access | [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/) | PLATINUM uses keyloggers that can also dump credentials. | API monitoring, Process monitoring, PowerShell logs, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Command and Control, Lateral Movement | [Remote File Copy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/) | PLATINUM transfers files using the Intel® Active Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) channel. | File monitoring, Packet capture, Process use of network, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Network protocol analysis, Process monitoring |
| Linux, Windows, macOS | Execution | [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/) | PLATINUM attempts to get users to open malicious files by sending spearphishing emails with attachments. | Anti-virus, Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring |
| Windows, Linux, macOS, SaaS | Initial Access | [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/) | PLATINUM sometimes uses drive-by attacks against vulnerable browser plugins. | Packet capture, Network device logs, Process use of network, Web proxy, Network intrusion detection system, SSL/TLS inspection |
| Windows, macOS, Linux | Initial Access | [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/) | PLATINUM sends spearphishing emails with attachments as its primary initial access vector. | File monitoring, Packet capture, Network intrusion detection system, Detonation chamber, Email gateway, Mail server |
| Windows | Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Credential Access | [Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1179/) | PLATINUM uses Windows hook interfaces for information gathering, such as credential access. | API monitoring, Binary file metadata, DLL monitoring, Loaded DLLs, Process monitoring, Windows event logs |
