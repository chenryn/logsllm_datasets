Abstract. Network worms are malicious programs that spread auto-
matically across networks by exploiting vulnerabilities that aﬀect a large
number of hosts. Because of the speed at which worms spread to large
computer populations, countermeasures based on human reaction time
are not feasible. Therefore, recent research has focused on devising new
techniques to detect and contain network worms without the need of
human supervision. In particular, a number of approaches have been
proposed to automatically derive signatures to detect network worms
by analyzing a number of worm-related network streams. Most of these
techniques, however, assume that the worm code does not change during
the infection process. Unfortunately, worms can be polymorphic. That
is, they can mutate as they spread across the network. To detect these
types of worms, it is necessary to devise new techniques that are able to
identify similarities between diﬀerent mutations of a worm.
This paper presents a novel technique based on the structural analy-
sis of binary code that allows one to identify structural similarities be-
tween diﬀerent worm mutations. The approach is based on the analysis
of a worm’s control ﬂow graph and introduces an original graph coloring
technique that supports a more precise characterization of the worm’s
structure. The technique has been used as a basis to implement a worm
detection system that is resilient to many of the mechanisms used to
evade approaches based on instruction sequences only.

1 Introduction
In recent years, Internet worms have proliferated because of hardware and soft-
ware mono-cultures, which make it possible to exploit a single vulnerability to
compromise a large number of hosts [25].
Most Internet worms follow a scan/compromise/replicate pattern of behavior,
where a worm instance ﬁrst identiﬁes possible victims, then exploits one or more

vulnerabilities to compromise a host, and ﬁnally replicates there. These actions
are performed through network connections and, therefore, network intrusion
detection systems (NIDSs) have been proposed by the security community as
mechanisms for detecting and responding to worm activity [16, 18].
However, as worms became more sophisticated and eﬃcient in spreading
across networks, it became clear that countermeasures based on human reac-
tion time were not feasible [23]. In response, the research community focused
on devising a number of techniques to automatically detect and contain worm
outbreaks.
In particular, the need for the timely generation of worm detection signatures
motivated the development of systems that analyze the contents of network
streams to automatically derive worm signatures. These systems, such as Early-
bird [19] and Autograph [6], implement a content sifting approach, which is based
on two observations. The ﬁrst observation is that some portion of the binary rep-
resentation of a worm is invariant; the second one is that the spreading dynamics
of a worm is diﬀerent from the behavior of a benign Internet application. That is,
these worm detection systems rely on the fact that it is rare to observe the same
byte string recurring within network streams exchanged between many sources
and many destinations. The experimental evaluation of these systems showed
that these assumptions hold for existing Internet worms.
A limitation of the systems based on content sifting is the fact that strings
of a signiﬁcant length that belong to diﬀerent network streams are required
to match (for example, byte strings with a length of 40 bytes are used in [19]).
Unfortunately, the next generation of Internet worms is likely to be polymorphic.
Polymorphic worms are able to change their binary representation as part of the
spreading process. This can be achieved by using self-encryption mechanisms
or semantics-preserving code manipulation techniques. As a consequence, copies
of a polymorphic worm might no longer share a common invariant substring of
suﬃcient length and the existing systems will not recognize the network streams
containing the worm copies as the manifestation of a worm outbreak.
Although polymorphic worms have not yet appeared in the wild, toolkits to
support code polymorphism are readily available [5, 11] and polymorphic worms
have been developed for research purposes [7]. Hence, the technological barriers
to developing these types of Internet worms are extremely low and it is only a
matter of time before polymorphic worms appear in the wild.
To detect this threat, novel techniques are needed that are able to identify
diﬀerent variations of the same polymorphic worm [15]. This paper presents a
technique that uses the structural properties of a worm’s executable to iden-
tify diﬀerent mutations of the same worm. The technique is resilient to code
modiﬁcations that make existing approaches based on content sifting ineﬀective.
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
– We describe a novel ﬁngerprinting technique based on control ﬂow informa-
tion that allows us to detect structural similarities between variations of a
polymorphic worm.

– We introduce an improvement of the ﬁngerprinting technique that is based
on a novel coloring scheme of the control ﬂow graph.
– We present an evaluation of a prototype system to detect polymorphic worms
that implements our novel ﬁngerprinting techniques.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3
presents the design goals and assumptions of our ﬁngerprinting technique and
provides a high-level overview of the approach. In Section 4, we describe how
the structure of executables is extracted and represented as control ﬂow graphs.
In Section 5, we discuss how ﬁngerprints are generated from control ﬂow graphs,
and we present an improvement of our scheme that is based on graph coloring. In
Section 6, a summary of the actual worm detection approach is given. Section 7
evaluates our techniques, and in Section 8, we point out limitations of the current
prototype. Finally, Section 9 brieﬂy concludes.
2 Related Work
Worms are a common phenomenon in today’s Internet, and despite signiﬁcant
research eﬀort over the last years, no general and eﬀective countermeasures have
been devised so far. One reason is the tremendous spreading speed of worms,
which leaves a very short reaction time to the defender [22, 23]. Another reason is
the distributed nature of the problem, which mandates that defense mechanisms
are deployed almost without gap on an Internet-wide scale [14].
Research on countermeasures against worms has focused on both the detection
and the containment of worms. A number of approaches have been proposed that
aim to detect worms based on network traﬃc anomalies. One key observation
was that scanning worms, which attempt to locate potential victims by sending
probing packets to random targets, exhibit a behavior that is quite diﬀerent from
most legitimate applications. Most prominently, this behavior manifests itself as
a large number of (often failed) connection attempts [24, 26].
Other detection techniques based on traﬃc anomalies check for a large number
of connections without previous DNS requests [27] or a large number of received
“ICMP unreachable messages” [3]. In addition, there are techniques to identify
worms by monitoring traﬃc sent to dark spaces, which are unused IP address
ranges [2], or honeypots [4].
Once malicious traﬃc ﬂows are identiﬁed, a worm has to be contained to pre-
vent further spreading [14]. One technique is based on rate limits for outgoing
connections [28]. The idea is that the spread of a worm can be stalled when
each host is only allowed to connect to a few new destinations each minute. An-
other approach is the use of signature-based network intrusion detection systems
(such as Snort [18]) that block traﬃc that contains known worm signatures. Un-
fortunately, the spreading speed of worms makes it very challenging to load the
appropriate signature in a timely manner. To address this problem, techniques
have been proposed to automatically extract signatures from network traﬃc.
The ﬁrst system to automatically extract signatures from network traﬃc was
Honeycomb [8], which looks for common substrings in traﬃc sent to a honeypot.
210
C. Kruegel et al.
Earlybird [19] and Autograph [6] extend Honeycomb and remove the assumption
that all analyzed traﬃc is malicious. Instead, these systems can identify recurring
byte strings in general network ﬂows. Our work on polymorphic worm detection
is based on these systems. To address the problem of polymorphic worms, which
encode themselves diﬀerently each time a copy is sent over the network, we
propose a novel ﬁngerprinting technique that replaces the string matching with
a technique that compares the structural aspects of binary code. This makes the
ﬁngerprinting more robust to modiﬁcations introduced by polymorphic code and
allows us to identify similarities in network ﬂows.
Newsome et al. [15] were the ﬁrst to point out the problem of string ﬁn-
gerprints in the case of polymorphic worms. Their solution, called Polygraph,
proposes capturing multiple invariant byte strings common to all observations of
a simulated polymorphic worm. The authors show that certain contiguous byte
strings, such as protocol framing strings and the high order bytes of buﬀer over-
ﬂow return addresses, usually remain constant across all instances of a polymor-
phic worm and can therefore be used to generate a worm signature. Our system
shares a common goal with Polygraph in that both approaches identify poly-
morphic worms in network ﬂows. However, we use a diﬀerent and complemen-
tary approach to reach this goal. While Polygraph focuses on multiple invariant
byte strings required for a successful exploit, we analyze structural similarities
between polymorphic variations of malicious code. This allows our system to de-
tect polymorphic worms that do not contain invariant strings at all. Of course,
it is also possible that Polygraph detects worms that our approach misses.
3 Fingerprinting Worms
In this paper, our premise is that at least some parts of a worm contain exe-
cutable machine code. While it is possible that certain regions of the code are
encrypted, others have to be directly executable by the processor of the victim
machine (e.g., there will be a decryption routine to decrypt the rest of the worm).
Our assumption is justiﬁed by the fact that most contemporary worms contain
executable regions. For example, in the 2004 “Top 10” list of worms published by
anti-virus vendors [21], all entries contain executable code. Note, however, that
worms that do not use executable code (e.g., worms written in non-compiled
scripting languages) will not be detected by our system.
Based on our assumption, we analyze network ﬂows for the presence of exe-
cutable code. If a network ﬂow contains no executable code, we discard it im-
mediately. Otherwise, we derive a set of ﬁngerprints for the executable regions.
Section 4 provides details on how we identify executable regions and describes
the mechanisms we employ to distinguish between likely code and sequences of
random data.
When an interesting region with executable code is identiﬁed inside a network
ﬂow, we generate ﬁngerprints for this region. Our ﬁngerprints are related to the
byte strings that are extracted from a network stream by the content sifting
approach. To detect polymorphic code, however, we generate ﬁngerprints at

a higher level of abstraction that cannot be evaded by simple modiﬁcations
to the malicious code. In particular, we desire the following properties for our
ﬁngerprinting technique:
– Uniqueness. Diﬀerent executable regions should map to diﬀerent ﬁnger-
prints. If identical ﬁngerprints are derived for unrelated executables, the sys-
tem cannot distinguish between ﬂows that should be correlated (e.g., because
they contain variations of the same worm) and those that should not. If the
uniqueness property is not fulﬁlled, the system is prone to producing false
positives.
– Robustness to insertion and deletion. When code is added to an exe-
cutable region, either by prepending it, appending it, or interleaving it with
the original executable (i.e., insertion), the ﬁngerprints for the original exe-
cutable region should not change. Furthermore, when parts of a region are
removed (i.e., deletion), the remaining fragment should still be identiﬁed as
part of the original executable. Robustness against insertion and deletion is
necessary to counter straightforward evasion attempts in which an attacker
inserts code before or after the actual malicious code fragment.
– Robustness to modiﬁcation. The ﬁngerprinting mechanism has to be ro-
bust against certain code modiﬁcations. That is, even when a code sequence
is modiﬁed by operations such as junk insertion, register renaming, code
transposition, or instruction substitution, the resulting ﬁngerprint should
remain the same. This property is necessary to identify diﬀerent variations
of a single polymorphic worm.
The byte strings generated by the content sifting approach fulﬁll the unique-
ness property, are robust to appending and prepending of padding, and are
robust to removal, provided that the result of the deletion operation is at least
as long as the analyzed strings. The approach, however, is very sensitive to mod-
iﬁcations of the code; even minimal changes can break the byte strings and allow
the attacker to evade detection.
Our key observation is that the internal structure of an executable is more
characteristic than its representation as a stream of bytes. That is, a represen-
tation that takes into account control ﬂow decision points and the sequence in
which particular parts of the code are invoked can better capture the nature of
an executable and its functionality. Thus, it is more diﬃcult for an attacker to
automatically generate variations of an executable that diﬀer in their structure
than variations that map to diﬀerent sequences of bytes.
For our purpose, the structure of an executable is described by its control
ﬂow graph (CFG). The nodes of the control ﬂow graph are basic blocks. An
edge from a block u to a block v represents a possible ﬂow of control from u to
v. A basic block describes a sequence of instructions without any jumps or jump
targets in the middle.
Given two regions of executable code that belong to two diﬀerent network
streams, we use their CFGs to determine if these two regions represent two
instances of a polymorphic worm. This analysis, however, cannot be based on

simply comparing the entire CFG of the regions because an attacker could triv-
ially evade this technique, e.g., by adding some random code to the end of
the worm body before sending a copy. Therefore, we have developed a tech-
nique that is capable of identifying common substructures of two control ﬂow
graphs. We identify common substructures in control ﬂow graphs by checking
for isomorphic connected subgraphs of size k (called k-subgraphs) contained in
all CFGs. Two subgraphs, which contain the same number of vertices k, are
said to be isomorphic if they are connected in the same way. When checking
whether two subgraphs are isomorphic, we only look at the edges between the
nodes under analysis. Thus, incoming and outgoing edges to other nodes are
ignored.
Two code regions are related if they share common k-subgraphs. Consider
the example of the two control ﬂow graphs in Figure 1. While these two graphs
appear diﬀerent at a ﬁrst glance, closer examination reveals that they share a
number of common 4-subgraphs. For example, nodes A to D form connected
subgraphs that are isomorphic. Note that the number of the incoming edges is
diﬀerent for the A nodes in both graphs. However, only edges from and to nodes
that are part of the subgraph are considered for the isomorphism test.
Diﬀerent subgraphs have to map to diﬀerent ﬁngerprints to satisfy the unique-
ness property. The approach is robust to insertion and deletion because two
CFGs are related as long as they share suﬃciently large, isomorphic subgraphs.
In addition, while it is quite trivial for an attacker to modify the string represen-
tation of an executable to generate many variations automatically, the situation
is diﬀerent for the CFG representation. Register renaming and instruction sub-
stitution (assuming that the instruction is not a control ﬂow instruction) have no
inﬂuence on the CFG. Also, the reordering of instructions within a basic block
and the reordering of the layout of basic blocks in the executable result in the
same control ﬂow graph. This makes the CFG representation more robust to
code modiﬁcations in comparison to the content sifting technique. Of course, an
adversary can attempt to evade our system by introducing code modiﬁcations
that change the CFG of the worm. Such and other limitations of our approach
are discussed in Section 8.
To reﬁne the speciﬁcation of the control ﬂow graph, we also take into ac-
count information derived from each basic block, or, to be more precise, from
the instructions in each block. This allows us to distinguish between blocks that
