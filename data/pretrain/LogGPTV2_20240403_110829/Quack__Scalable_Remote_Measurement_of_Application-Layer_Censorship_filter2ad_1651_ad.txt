uine interference. The list of all countries with at least 15
echo servers is presented in the Appendix. This list has
multiple other countries that are listed as “Not Free” in
the Freedom of the Net report, including Belarus, Russia,
Pakistan, and Vietnam.
Pakistan, as an example, is identiﬁed by prior work [41]
as practicing DNS poisoning. DNS poisoning is one po-
tential implementation of Internet censorship, and would
render application-layer blocking unnecessary. The tech-
nique presented in this paper does not consider any other
possible implementations of Internet censorship, and will
therefore miss countries who do not rely heavily on
application-layer censorship. Furthermore, many non-
technical factors are included in the Freedom of the Net
rating; not all “Not Free” countries block content using
technical means.
We have validated our classiﬁcations with anecdotal
reports, but we also want to ensure there is consistency in
our classiﬁcation. To do so, we look at what percent of
ASes, /24s, and echo servers in a given country observe
any Blocked result in this experiment. The countries that
we observe widespread blocking in are represented in the
shaded region in Figure 11. While some countries have
interference in almost all instances, e.g. China, there are
several countries with interference not performed across
the entire country. This potentially reﬂects heterogeneous
deployments of interference. We observe in Figure 11 that
some countries that we do not classify as blocking any
domains have comparable numbers of servers experienc-
ing at least one Blocked result as countries we do classify

Figure 11: Blocking Rates Per Country—We examine the
CLBL results, looking at what fraction of ASes, Servers, and
/24s in each country observe any Blocked result. The shaded
regions are countries we identify as having widespread interfer-
ence. While some countries face near ubiquitous interference
across tested servers, more countries display large variation.
Figure 12: Top Interfered CLBL Domains—We compared
the list of domains interfered with in each country to ﬁnd those
most broadly blocked. The top 10 are presented above. Porno-
graphic websites are overrepresented in the table, but the single
most broadly blocked domain is the homepage of a free circum-
vention technology. China blocks every domain in the table.
as blocking. These countries, Mexico and Zambia, have
blocking events that are disperse and inconsistent in the
set of domains being blocked, reﬂecting either unreliable
echo servers or echo servers with highly-local blocking.
Additionally, these countries had “no reports of blocking”
in the Freedom of the Net 2016 report [21].
The most commonly blocked domains we observe
in the Citizen Lab block list are shown in Fig-
ure 12.
The most commonly blocked domain is
www.hotspotshield.com,
the homepage for a free
VPN service. VPNs are common circumvention tools.
Surprisingly, it is only blocked in ﬁve of the 13 coun-
tries where we detected censorship: China, Iran, Jordan,
Turkey, and UAE. We see that the most consistently
blocked domains are for circumvention tools, pornogra-
phy, and gambling. Political content tends to be region-
speciﬁc, and is less often blocked by multiple countries.
6.3 Disruption Mechanisms
By using echo servers, we ensure that the potentially sen-
sitive payload is on both the inbound and outbound halves
of the connection. This means that our system will detect
interference regardless of directionality of the censor. In
order to test whether the direction of the request matters,
we perform the Citizen Lab test using the Discard Pro-
tocol [36]. This protocol is similar to the Echo Protocol,
but instead of echoing the request, the server only ACKs
the data. Blocks that occur in our test of echo servers,
but not discard servers, could be instances of blocking on
only outbound data. This test provides additional valuable
insight into the mechanisms used for blocking.
We test the subset of echo servers that are also discard
servers, sending identical payloads as in Section 6.2. Echo
servers are also often discard servers, so this requirement
reduced the number of testable servers from 57,309 to
27,966. Of the 11 interfering countries, we are able to
maintain enough servers to classify disruption in all but
Uzbekistan.
In the 10 remaining countries we observed blocking
when using echo servers, we continue to observe disrup-
tion in only 4 when using the Discard Protocol: China,
Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey. This implies the other coun-
tries we observe performing HTTP blocking are doing so
only on data outbound from their network. This evidence
is not necessarily conclusive, as the reduced set of echo
servers may be reducing our visibility into these countries.
For example, we observe reliable disruption in a few Ira-
nian ASes for the Discard Protocol. However, because the
vast majority of Iranian ASes do not interfere in this test,
we do not classify the interference as widespread across
the country.
6.4 HTTP vs. HTTPS
The Echo Protocol allows arbitrary data to be sent to and
returned by the echo server. This ﬂexibility is a strength
of our technique, and is an advantage over other pro-
tocols with more constraints on sending and receiving
arbitrary byte streams. To demonstrate why this capabil-
ity is important, as well as illuminate practices in network
interference, we repeat our test of the Citizen Lab Block
List, but send requests formatted as valid TLS ClientHello
messages with the Server Name Indication (SNI) Exten-
sion.
The Server Name Indication Extension [16] was de-
veloped to allow a TLS client to inform the server what
domain it is attempting to connect to before the server
must send a certiﬁcate. Since certiﬁcates are used for au-
thentication and linked to domain names, a server hosting
many websites would need this information to connect to
a client securely. Unfortunately, SNI places the domain
name in clear-text in the ﬁrst message sent by the client
to the server, making it easy to detect when a client is

in a TLS handshake. We ﬁnd that networks do interfere
based on this ﬁrst message alone.
Of the 12 interfering countries we detect in the Citizen
Lab experiment, we were able to conduct enough tests
to conﬁdently classify all of them. We continue to ob-
serve disruption in only 5 when using TLS: Egypt, Iran,
Jordan, Turkey and UAE. For the other countries in Fig-
ure 10, TLS may aid in circumventing interference of
HTTP requests based on the application-layer.
The only instance of interference occurring in a country
that was not detected with just HTTP requests from the
Citizen Lab list occurs in New Zealand. The domains
blocked are identical across two servers in the same /24
routing preﬁx, which is allocated to an academic insti-
tution in the country. We conclude that the blocking is
being performed by the institution, and not a national
policy decision to only block HTTPS.
While the domains we observe interference with are
similar in four of the ﬁve countries, in Iran the set of
disrupted domains grows drastically when testing with
TLS ClientHellos: the number of blocked domains in Iran
increases from 25 to 374. The list of blocked URLs also
changes composition to include signiﬁcantly more do-
mains classiﬁed by Citizen Lab as News, Human Rights,
and Anonymization tools.
There are several possible reasons a country would
implement a policy blocking a domain through HTTPS
but not HTTP. As the domain name is the only visibility
into the nature of the content in a HTTPS connection, a
country could be aggressive in blocking domains where
only a single page on the domain is undesired. In the case
of HTTP they could simply block the speciﬁc page or
given keywords, since all of the content will be visible to
the censor. Alternatively, a country could wish to have
visibility into the resources accessed at a given site, which
forcing a downgrade to HTTP would allow.
6.5 Disruption Breadth
We have established to this point that we have a tool that
allows us to test for application-layer censorship across
74 countries for roughly a thousand domains. While this
is useful, we explore a different capability of our tool in
this section. We perform a search for disruption across
40 countries for the 100,000 top domains as ranked by
Alexa [2].
In order to perform tests across this many domains, we
restrict ourselves to at most 20 requests per domain per
country; this reduces the total number of requests dramati-
cally. Several countries contain thousands of echo servers.
Additionally, because we only make serial requests to any
particular server, we test only in countries with at least

Figure 13: Interference of Alexa 100k—We test the Alexa
Top 100k domains across the 40 countries with the most echo
servers and observe censorship in 7. The number of censored
domains in the Alexa list does not necessarily correlate with the
number blocked in the CLBL, but every country seen blocking
in the Citizen Lab experiment also interferes in the Alexa 100k.
100 servers. This means the most requests a server must
process sequentially is 20,000.
This experiment reveals interference in 7 countries,
presented in Figure 13. Of the countries with enough echo
servers to be tested, the countries we observe blocking the
top domains are the same countries who were blocking
domains in the Citizen Lab experiment.
Of the domains that are similar in both the Citizen
Lab list and the Alexa Top 100k, we see large overlap
in blocked domains. We deﬁne similar domains as those
with the same domain name, not including sub domains.
One interesting behavior this heuristic shows is in
Egypt. Several torproject.org subdomains are tested
in the CLBL, but only the root domain was tested in Alexa.
We observe that the interference in Egypt is dependent
on subdomain: the root domain torproject.org is not
blocked, and the subdomain www.torproject.org is
blocked on one echo server in Egypt when tested only
seconds apart.
Another interesting blocking behavior we observe is
that Iran blocks an innocuous health and lifestyle site,
psiphonhealthyliving.com. This site is likely collat-
eral damage, as Iran also blocks the domain psiphon.ca,
the homepage for a censorship circumvention technology.
Additionally, we can observe that in Iran, all domains
belonging to the Israeli TLD (.il) are blocked.
Testing the Alexa 100k provides insight into what is
being blocked in each country, without introducing the
biases of the people manually curating lists, such as the
CLBL. In Figure 14, we analyze the domains blocked in
our Alexa experiment that were not included in the Citizen
Lab experiment. Our domain categorization is performed
by FortiGuard Labs, a common DPI tool provider, using
their web interface [20].
Many of the domains we discover as blocked in our test
of domains from Alexa are pornography. Interestingly,
some domain classiﬁcations were not at all present in the

Figure 14: Alexa Domain Discovery—We categorize the do-
mains blocked in each country in our Alexa 100k experiment,
excluding those with a similar entry in the Citizen Lab experi-
ment, and present the top 10 categories. As in other experiments,
the largest censored category is pornography. However, other
categories show the breadth that can be uncovered by testing the
entire Alexa 100k. For example, none of the blocked shopping
domains in the Alexa dataset were in the CLBL.
Citizen Lab experiment, such as Shopping. Other cate-
gories, such as Personal Websites and Blogs and News
and Media, can be extremely informative when consid-
ering what content is deliberately blocked by countries.
Overall, we see that 3,130 of the domains we observe
as blocked are not in the CLBL. This is a signiﬁcant
improvement in coverage of blocked URLs, as we only
see 220 URLs blocked from the Citizen Lab list.
Using the large set of domains tested, we can compare
what domains are blocked in multiple countries, despite
the sparseness of block list intersections. Many categories
have domains that are not blocked in multiple countries,
e.g. News and Media, meaning that the particular news
sites blocked by each country are not the same as in other
countries that also censor News and Media sites. In con-
trast, the set of blocked domains depicting violence and
advocating extremism are the same in every country that
blocks that type of content.
Finally, we utilize the ordered nature of the Alexa
top domains to compare how each country’s blocking
changes with the popularity of a site, shown in Figure 15.
While some countries show generally uniform distribu-
tion of blocking across the top 100,000 domains, others
