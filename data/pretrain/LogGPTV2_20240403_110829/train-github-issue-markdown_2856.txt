## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Make a change in the project's AppDelegate.m that results in a compiler warning. e.g. mark the AppDelegate class as `+__attribute__((deprecated("foo")))` in AppDelegate.h
  2. flutter build ios
The compiler warnings should be emitted to the stderr, but today are not
displayed.
