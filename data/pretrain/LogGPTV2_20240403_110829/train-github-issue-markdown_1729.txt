The following code:
    pub fn log(x: f64) -> f64
    {
        let out: f64;
        unsafe {
        asm!("fldln2
            fldl $1
            fyl2x" : "=t"(out) : "m"(x));}
        out
    }
errors with the message:
    error: couldn't allocate output register for constraint 't' at line 27
The constraint `t` refers to the top of the floating point stack in GCC's
inline assembly, and the unsafe guide says our constraints mirror theirs.
