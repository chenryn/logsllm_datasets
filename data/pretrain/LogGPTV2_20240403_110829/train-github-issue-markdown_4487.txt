current send_file implement a traditional method to assign download filename,  
according to RFC 5987 there is a method to have utf-8 encoding in it which is
support by all modern browser nowadays,
I use this line to make it
    rv.headers['Content-Disposition'] = "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''%s"%(urllib.quote_plus(filename.encode('utf-8')))
I am not using headers.add,  
because you can see there have to use asterisk character which is nasty
