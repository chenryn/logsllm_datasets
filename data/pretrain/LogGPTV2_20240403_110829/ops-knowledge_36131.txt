User: How to build a high availability load balancing cluster?
Assistant: To build a high-availability load balancing cluster, you usually need to consider the following aspects: 1. Select the appropriate load balancing software: common load balancing software includes Nginx, HAProxy, F5, etc., and you need to choose the appropriate software according to your actual needs. 2. Set up multiple load balancing servers: In order to achieve high availability, at least two load balancing servers need to be set up, and the synchronization of load balancing configuration needs to be considered, and tools such as RSYNC can be used for configuration synchronization. 3. Set VIP (virtual IP): Set virtual IP in multiple load balancing servers, and the client can access the server cluster by accessing VIP. You can use keepalived and other tools to realize the configuration of virtual IP. 4. Set up health check: The load balancing server needs to regularly check the health status of the back-end server. When a server fails, it needs to be removed from the server cluster as soon as possible, and the access request is forwarded to other servers. 5. Set load balancing strategy: According to business needs, load balancing strategies such as round robin, weighted round robin, and IP hash can be used to achieve balanced distribution of access requests to back-end servers. 6. Monitoring the load balancing cluster: By monitoring the running status of the load balancing cluster and the health status of the back-end server, faults can be detected and processed in time.
