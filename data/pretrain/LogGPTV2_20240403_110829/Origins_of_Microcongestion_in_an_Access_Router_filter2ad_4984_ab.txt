less than 1ms of workload at worst. Nonetheless, the multiplexed traﬃc leads to
a signiﬁcantly longer ramp-up period that reaches more than 5ms of maximum
workload at tA on the right of the plot.
To quantify this eﬀect we deﬁne the “link multiplexing” ratio
LM =
maxk Ak(Si, µo)
A(ST , µo)
,
which obeys LM ∈ [0, 1]. Values close to zero indicate that the link has a negli-
gible individual contribution. Therefore if all substreams have small values, the
non-linear eﬀect of multiplexing is very strong. In contrast, if LM ≈ 1 for some
link then it is largely generating the observed delays itself, and multiplexing may
not be playing a major role. Large values of LM are in fact subject to ambiguity,
as illustrated in Figure 4, where the ratio is large for both links. The busy pe-
riod has a bimodal structure. The ﬁrst mode is dominated by link 1, however its
inﬂuence has died oﬀ at time tA, and so is not signiﬁcantly responsible for the
size of A.

The results for the data are presented in Figure 5. In more than 95% of the
busy periods traﬃc from each individual link contributes to less than 60% of
the actual busy period amplitude. Therefore, it appears that multiplexing is an
important factor overall for the delays experienced over the access link.
4.3 Flow Burstiness
There are many deﬁnitions of burstiness. It is not possible to fully address this
issue without entering into details which would require traﬃc models, which is
beyond the scope of this paper. We therefore focus on burstiness related to 5-
tuple ﬂows, to investigate the impact that individual ﬂows, or groups of ﬂows,
have on overall delays. We begin by letting the total traﬃc ST be that from a
single link, to avoid the complications induced by multiplexing.
In order to obtain insight into the impact of ﬂow burstiness we ﬁrst select as
a substream the ‘worst’ individual ﬂow in ST in the simple sense of having the
largest number of packets in the rampup period [ts, tA]. Two extreme examples
of what can occur in the rampup period are given in Figures 6 and 7. In each
case the busy period amplitude is large, however the ﬂow contribution varies
from minimal in Figure 6, to clearly dominant in Figure 7.

signiﬁcant impact on the queue buildup.
Fig. 7. Flow with multiple packets that
dominates the busy period.
To reﬁne the deﬁnition of worst ﬂow and to quantify its impact we proceed
as follows. For each busy period in the total stream we classify traﬃc into 5-
tuple ﬂows. We then use each individual ﬂow Sj as a substream and measure
the respective A(Sj, µo). The worst or “top” ﬂow is the one with the largest
individual contribution. We deﬁne “ﬂow burstiness” as
FB = max
j
maxk Ak(Sj, µo)
A(ST , µo)
,
where as before the inner maximum is over all busy periods (or partial busy
periods) of the relevant substream falling in [ts, tA]. The top ﬂow may or may
not be the one with the greatest number of packets.
Our top ﬂow metric takes values FB ∈ (0, 1]. If FB is close to zero then we
know that all ﬂows have individually small contributions. Alternatively if FB is
134

large then, similarly to LM, there is some ambiguity. We certainly know that
the top ﬂow contributes signiﬁcant delay but in case of bimodality this ﬂow may
not actually be responsible for the peak deﬁning the amplitude. In addition,
knowledge about the top ﬂow can say nothing about the other ﬂows.
We present the cumulative distribution function for FB in Figure 8 for each
of the OC-48 links. For more than 90% of the busy periods the contribution of
the top ﬂow was less than 50%. In addition for 20% of the busy periods the
contribution of the top ﬂow was minimal (for example as in Figure 6), that is
it was the smallest possible, corresponding to the system time of a single packet
with size equal to the largest appearing in the ﬂow.
If the top ﬂow has little impact, it is natural to ask if perhaps a small number
of top ﬂows together could dominate. One approach would be to form a stream
of the n largest ﬂows in the sense of FB. However, as the choice of n is arbitrary,
and it is computationally intensive to look over many values of n, we ﬁrst change
our deﬁnition to select a more appropriate substream. We deﬁne a ﬂow to be
bursty if its substream generates a packet delay which exceeds the minimal delay
(as deﬁned above) during the rampup period. Note that only very tame ﬂows
are not bursty by this deﬁnition! We denote by Sb the substream of ST that
corresponds to all bursty ﬂows, and compute the new ﬂow burstiness metric:

As before, FB
(cid:2) ∈ [0, 1], and its value can be interpreted in an analogous way
to before. The diﬀerence is that, as the substream is much larger in general,
a small value is now extremely strong evidence that individual ﬂows do not
(cid:2)
dominate. Note that it is possible that no ﬂow is bursty, in which case FB
= 0,
and therefore that the top ﬂow is not necessarily bursty. This has the advantage
of avoiding the classiﬁcation of a ﬂow as dominant, thereby giving the impression
Origins of Microcongestion in an Access Router
135
that it is bursty in some sense, simply because a trivial ﬂow dominates a trivial
busy period.
Our results are presented in Figure 8. As expected, the contribution of Sb
to the busy period is more signiﬁcant: in 20% of cases it exceeds 60%. On the
(cid:2)
other hand, 20% of the busy periods had FB
equal or close to zero, indicating
that they had no bursty ﬂows. Indeed, we found that only 7.7% of all ﬂows in
our dataset were classiﬁed as “bursty” according to our deﬁnition. Only in a
very small number of cases does the top or the subset of bursty ﬂows account
for the majority of the workload (for example as in Figure 7). Consequently, it
seems that in today’s network ﬂow dynamics have little impact on the delays
experienced by packets in core networks.
5 Summary
We have studied in detail the origins of packet delays ﬂowing toward an access
link, and clariﬁed the role of three diﬀerent mechanisms, related to: unequal link
bandwidth; multiplexing across diﬀerent input links; and traﬃc burstiness.
Our ﬁrst contribution was methodological. We showed how a router model
can be used to investigate the role of the diﬀerent mechanisms, and deﬁned
metrics to help assess their impact. The possible values of the metrics, and how
they can be interpreted, was discussed.
Our second contribution was to investigate the actual contributions in todays
access networks, via a comprehensive and representative data set. We focused on
an OC-3 access link fed mainly by two OC-48 links carrying roughly 50% of the
traﬃc each. The link was not highly congested (no packet drops over 13 hours
and packet delays all under 6ms), however it was much more congested than ty-
pical core links. We found that the link bandwidth reduction factor of 16 (from
OC-48 to OC-3) played a signiﬁcant role in delay buildups (non-trivial ampliﬁ-
cation factor AF), indicating that traﬃc is bursty, and not signiﬁcantly shaped
at OC-3 rates upstream. Multiplexing was also found to be signiﬁcant (small
multiplexing fraction LM), as in most cases the traﬃc on the individual links
could not individually induce delays which were a large fraction of the observed
delays. Finally the eﬀect of individual 5-tuple ﬂows, and sets of ‘bursty’ ﬂows,
was found to be small in most cases (small ﬂow burstiness ratio FB), leading
to the noteworthy conclusion that 5-tuple ﬂow dynamics are not responsible for
excessive packet delay in today’s core networks. These conclusions are strongly
traﬃc dependent. The methodology and metrics we deﬁne can be used to mo-
nitor traﬃc evolution, and are especially eﬀective when one wishes to conﬁrm a
hypothesis that a given eﬀect (such as individual ﬂow impact) is negligible.
