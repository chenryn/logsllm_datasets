ABSTRACT
Illegal booter services offer denial of service (DoS) attacks for
a fee of a few tens of dollars a month. Internationally, police
have implemented a range of different types of intervention
aimed at those using and offering booter services, including
arrests and website takedown. In order to measure the im-
pact of these interventions we look at the usage reports that
booters themselves provide and at measurements of reflected
UDP DoS attacks, leveraging a five year measurement dataset
that has been statistically demonstrated to have very high
coverage. We analysed time series data (using a negative
binomial regression model) to show that several interventions
have had a statistically significant impact on the number of
attacks. We show that, while there is no consistent effect of
highly-publicised court cases, takedowns of individual booters
precede significant, but short-lived, reductions in recorded at-
tack numbers. However, more wide-ranging disruptions have
much longer effects. The closure of HackForums’ booter mar-
ket reduced attacks for 13 weeks globally (and for longer in
particular countries) and the FBI’s coordinated operation in
December 2018, which involved both takedowns and arrests,
reduced attacks by a third for at least 10 weeks and resulted
in lasting change to the structure of the booter market.

INTRODUCTION
1
‘Booter’, or ‘stresser’, services provide Denial of Service (DoS)
attacks as-a-service. DoS attacks generate large amounts of
traffic which overwhelm end-users or web services, taking
them offline or making legitimate access impossible [26].
Booter operators advertise customer-facing websites, where
individuals can set up accounts and order attacks [54], with
payments accepted using digital services such as PayPal or
through transfers of cryptocurrency [22, 28]. A range of
different packages and membership options are available,
with $10 to $20 being typical for a month’s worth of DoS
attacks of sufficient size to disrupt an end-user connection or
a website which does not have specialist DoS protection.
Operating a booter service or purchasing a DoS attack
is illegal in most jurisdictions. However, when asked during
research undertaken in 2014, booter operators were uncon-
cerned about the possibility of law enforcement taking action
against them [22]. Nevertheless, a number of police actions
have taken place in recent years, and this research aims
to measure whether there has been any impact on booter
provision and booter usage.
There has been much research into the effects of police
action on offline illicit markets and services, however there
is little understanding of what ‘best practice’ looks like for
cybercrime, which tends to be more geographically dispersed
and organised around online communities and markets which
are particularly resilient [1, 43]. In practice, law enforcement
interventions in online illicit markets are not straightfor-
ward. Displacement is a problem for both online and offline

markets [23, 44, 63] and participants may seek new ven-
dors or locations following the shutdown of established mar-
kets [58, 59]. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of a range
of different kinds of interventions – high profile court cases
and sentencing of booter providers, arrests, takedowns of
booter websites, and messaging campaigns targeted at users.
We measure the impact of interventions using two datasets.
The first is a dataset of victims of reflected UDP amplifi-
cation attacks, a technique widely used by booters, which
covers a five-year period from 2014. This dataset is known
to have good coverage of many widely abused protocols [61].
The second dataset is of self-reported DoS attack numbers
collected from booter websites. It covers 75% or more of ac-
tive booters over the 18-month period in which the majority
of interventions have occurred.
We start (§2) by considering major police interventions
against booter providers and users and then discuss (§3)
the attack datasets we use. We present (§4) our negative
binomial regression model and show several linkages between
interventions and deviations from seasonal trends. We do
further analysis (§4.1) of the data at a country level and show
the impact of a UK-specific advertising campaign. After
reviewing related work (§5), we discuss what makes for an
effective police intervention (§6) and finally draw conclusions
(§7). Ethical considerations are outlined in the Appendix.
2 THE INTERVENTIONS
Law enforcement can respond to cybercrime not only by ar-
resting criminals, but by seeking to prevent people becoming
involved, by disrupting harmful criminal activity, and pro-
tecting those at risk of becoming victims. For example, the
UK Home Office sets out their ‘Pursue, Prevent, and Protect’
approach in their Serious and Organised Crime Strategy [21].
Here, we outline some of the main interventions against
booter services, their providers, and their users in the 2014–
2019 period for which we have DoS attack data. The events
come from an analysis of Brian Krebs’ popular blog [30–38],
but were also widely covered in the press. We have added
one further event (§2.7) which was not widely reported but
was very visible within booter communities.
2.1 LizardStresser
In early 2015, the backend database of users of the Lizard-
Stresser booter service, which had only been in operation for
a few weeks, was leaked. On 28 August 2015 six UK individ-
uals who had purchased attacks were arrested in ‘Operation
Vivarium’. Approximately 50 others who had registered with
the site received a ‘cease and desist’ home visit from UK po-
lice. Although merely registering at a booter is not an offence
in the UK the individuals were told that DoS attacks are
“illegal, can prevent individuals from accessing vital online
services, and can cause significant financial and reputational
damage to businesses” [45].
Only one related court case has been reported. On 22
December 2015 a 17-year-old pleaded guilty to a DoS attack
(and another offence), receiving a 12-month sentence in a
young offenders’ institution. He also had to pay over £1 000
compensation to the DoS victim [46].
On 6 October 2016 two 19-year-olds were arrested in the
US and the Netherlands for allegedly running the Lizard-
Stresser booter service [32]. On 27 March 2018 the American
received a three month prison sentence and was ordered to
pay $350 000 in restitution after pleading guilty and cooper-
ating with authorities [49].
2.2 Netspoof, etc.
On 8 April 2016, a 20-year-old man was sentenced in the UK
after pleading guilty to 6 charges under the Computer Misuse
Act and 4 under the Serious Crime Act. He had operated four
booter services, including one called Netspoof, and received a
2-year youth detention sentence, suspended for 18 months,
100 hours unpaid work and £800 costs [36].
In December 2016, 12 people were arrested for purchasing
DoS attacks on Netspoof, 30 cease and desist notices were
issued, computers were seized from 11 of the suspects, one pro-
tective visit was made, and two cautions were issued [47]. This
was part of a coordinated international action against users of
booter services which took place between 5 and 9 December
2016. It involved Europol as well as law enforcement author-
ities from Australia, Belgium, France, Hungary, Lithuania,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden,
the UK, and the US. Overall, there were 34 arrests, and 101
suspects were interviewed and cautioned [16].
2.3 HackForums & Mirai
On 28 October 2016, the “Server Stress Testing” (SST)
section of HackForums, a large and long-running English-
language underground forum, was removed, and advertise-
ments for booter services were banned [33]. The proximate
cause of this shuttering was a telephone conversation between
HackForums’ owner and an FBI agent (personal communica-
tion, 2018), but it was the culmination of a series of events.
On 8 September 2016, Brian Krebs posted an article [34]
about a leaked backend database from the vDOS booter,
which contained entries for tens of thousands of users and
more than 150 000 attacks. He claimed the operators made
more than $600 000 over two years, and that the service was
operated by two men in Israel, with support from others in the
US. Hours later, the two Israeli men were arrested [30]. This
was followed a DoS attack against Krebs’ website that was
reported as being the largest ever recorded at the time [35].
On 30 September the source code for Mirai, the botnet
responsible for this DoS attack, was released on HackForums,
apparently because the author feared arrest and wanted an
excuse for having a copy of the code. On 21 October, a Mirai
botnet launched an even larger attack against the Internet
infrastructure firm Dyn causing outages for many popular
sites, including Twitter, PayPal, Reddit, and Netflix [31].
The HackForums ban left a gap in the market for advertis-
ing and discussing booters and a few months later stresserfo-
rums.net was set up. There was some displacement to this
new forum, and it had almost 800 members and over 7 000
Booting the Booters: Evaluating the Effects of Police Interventions

posts when it closed in April 2018, around the time of the
Webstresser takedown (detailed below). A number of forums
with the same name have subsequently failed to gain traction.
The Israelis were charged, but it appears the matter is
still proceeding. In the UK, a 19-year-old pleaded guilty to
a number of offences relating to vDOS. On 19 December
2017, he was sentenced to 16 months in a young offenders
institution, suspended for two years, and was ordered to
complete 20 days of rehabilitation activity [56].
On 18 September 2018, three men aged 21 to 22 years were
sentenced for authoring and using the Mirai botnet. They
each received five years probation, 2 500 hours of community
service, and were ordered to pay $127 000 restitution. This
light sentence (for the US) was due to the cooperation of
the defendants in helping the investigation, identifying other
suspects, and assisting industry to combat incidents [37].
On 26 October 2018, one of the men received a further
sentence for using Mirai for DoS attacks against Rutgers
University. He was sentenced to 2 500 hours of community
service, six months home confinement, and was ordered to
pay $8.6 million in restitution [38].
2.4 Titaniumstresser
In the UK a 19-year-old received a 24-month sentence on 25
April 2017 (reduced on appeal to 21 months) [2] for operating
the Titaniumstresser booter and personally committing 594
DoS attacks against 181 targets. The service was reportedly
used for 1.7M attacks. His case was also widely reported
on 22 November 2016 when he had pleaded guilty to two
offences under the Computer Misuse Act and one money
laundering offence. At a confiscation hearing in March 2018,
he was ordered to repay £69 629 in compensation or face an
additional two years in prison [20].
2.5 Webstresser
On 24 April 2018 the domain for the Webstresser booter
was seized and its alleged administrators were arrested in the
UK, Croatia, Canada, and Serbia [17]. Europol subsequently
reported that 250 UK users of Webstresser were to receive
police visits or warnings [18] and that users in the Netherlands,
Italy, Spain, Croatia, Australia, Canada, and Hong Kong
would also be “targeted”.
2.7 NCA Google search advert warnings
The HackForums ban on adverts for booter services meant
providers had to find other ways of attracting customers. One
booter service purchased Google search adverts (displayed
when people searched for relevant keywords) [9]. However,
advertising can also be used by the police.
From late December 2017 to June 2018 the UK National
Crime Agency (NCA) bought search adverts from Google
which warned young users on UK IP addresses of the illegality
of DoS attacks when they searched for booter-related terms.
As with the in-person warnings delivered in Operation Vivar-
ium, the aim was to divert people away from cybercrime, by
informing them of potential legal consequences.
3 DATASETS
We use two datasets, provided to us by the Cambridge Cy-
bercrime Centre, to measure whether the number of DoS
attacks by booter services is affected by police interventions.
The first dataset is of reflected amplified UDP DoS attacks
in which a small incoming UDP packet generates a much
larger response – and if the source IP of the original packet
is spoofed then substantial amounts of traffic can be directed
at a victim. The dataset is of victim IPs seen by a large
number of honeypot machines roped into attacks using the
protocols QOTD, CHARGEN, time, DNS, PORTMAP, NTP,
LDAP, MSSQL Monitor, MDNS, and SSDP. Full details
of the dataset are provided by Thomas et al. along with a
statistical analysis to show high levels of coverage for many
of these UDP protocols [61]. For analysis we group flows of
packets to the same victim IP or prefix for the same protocol
until there is a gap of at least 15 minutes with no packets
being received by any sensor. We then check to see if any
sensor received more than 5 packets. If so then we deem it
an attack, if not then we classify the event as a scan.
While this dataset counts traffic volume we cannot reliably
translate this into the traffic volume which victims would
experience and so we focus on the number of attacks rather
than their size. The problem is that we do not know how
many real reflectors booters are using and so we are unable
to scale our observed volumes appropriately.
There are limitations to this dataset because not all re-
flected attacks are associated with booters and booters can
perform other types of attack. However, we believe it is
broadly representative of booter activity. The attack logs of
three prominent booters1 from 2014, 2016, and 2017/2018 all
2.6 FBI action: Xmas2018
On 19 December 2018 the FBI announced that they had ar-
rested three booter operators, running DownThem, Ampnode,
and Quantum Stresser and that they had seized 15 domain
names for booter websites [13]. Dataset analysis shows this
immediately took seven booter services offline (the other
domain names were either duplicates for the same service or
the booter was not operational at that time). The timing,
just before Christmas, was intended to disrupt a pattern of
increased DoS activity over the holiday period [8].
1Of the 285 414 attacks for booter.io recorded between 2014-03-24
and 2014-09-07, 261 968 (91%) are for method names indicating
UDP reflection (UDP, CHARGEN, UDPLAG). Of the 169 845 at-
tacks recorded between 2016-05-01 and 2016-07-23 for vDOS 123 751
(72%) are for method names indicating UDP reflection (DNS, NTP,
SNMP, PORTMAP) [61]. Of the 412 059 attacks recorded for Web-
stresser (§2.5) between 2017-10-18 and 2018-02-26, 339 181 (82%)
were probably UDP reflection attacks based on their name. The UDP
honeypot dataset contains 97% of the LDAP, NTP and PORTMAP
attacks but only 111 306 (33%) of the attacks overall, mostly because
of only 9% coverage for ‘SUDP’. It is hard to know what method
names mean without either performing self attacks [55] or observing
the attacks with sensors. Coverage for named methods that might
be UDP based is: ‘LDAP’ 41 097/42 136 (98%), ‘NTP’ 32 094/33 171

show over 70% of attacks were likely UDP reflection attacks.
Krupp et al. were able to attribute 26% of DNS and 13% of
NTP attacks to specific booters which they had bought at-
tacks from [40]. Noroozian et al. found that over 48% of UDP
reflection attacks and 62% of victims are on IP addresses in
access networks [48], Sharma found that 89% of US, 98% of
UK, 71% of FR, and 89% of DE victims were home users [57].
Sharma also found that over 50% of attacks were less than
5 minutes. This is a pattern of behaviour which we would
expect from booters. Nevertheless there will be other sources
of UDP reflection attacks included within this dataset.
