## Abstract
Illegal booter services offer denial of service (DoS) attacks for a fee of a few tens of dollars per month. Internationally, law enforcement agencies have implemented various interventions, including arrests and website takedowns, to combat these services. To measure the impact of these interventions, we analyzed usage reports from booter services and data on reflected UDP DoS attacks, using a five-year dataset with high statistical coverage. Our time series analysis, employing a negative binomial regression model, revealed that several interventions had a statistically significant impact on the number of attacks. While highly publicized court cases did not consistently affect attack numbers, takedowns of individual booters led to short-lived but significant reductions. More comprehensive disruptions, such as the closure of HackForums' booter market and the FBI's coordinated operation in December 2018, resulted in longer-lasting effects, reducing attacks by a third for at least ten weeks and causing lasting changes in the booter market structure.

## Introduction
Booter or stresser services provide Denial of Service (DoS) attacks as-a-service. These attacks generate large amounts of traffic, overwhelming end-users or web services, making legitimate access impossible. Booter operators advertise their services through customer-facing websites, where individuals can set up accounts and order attacks, often paying via digital services like PayPal or cryptocurrency. Typical monthly fees range from $10 to $20 for DoS attacks sufficient to disrupt an end-user connection or a website without specialized DoS protection.

Operating a booter service or purchasing a DoS attack is illegal in most jurisdictions. However, in 2014, booter operators were largely unconcerned about potential law enforcement action. Despite this, several police actions have occurred in recent years, and this research aims to measure their impact on booter provision and usage.

While there is extensive research on the effects of police action on offline illicit markets, there is limited understanding of best practices for cybercrime, which is more geographically dispersed and organized around resilient online communities. Law enforcement interventions in online illicit markets are complex due to displacement, where participants may seek new vendors or locations following the shutdown of established markets. This paper evaluates the effects of various interventions, including high-profile court cases, arrests, takedown of booter websites, and messaging campaigns targeted at users.

We use two datasets to measure the impact of interventions:
1. A five-year dataset of victims of reflected UDP amplification attacks, which covers many widely abused protocols.
2. Self-reported DoS attack numbers collected from booter websites, covering 75% or more of active booters over an 18-month period.

The paper is structured as follows:
- Section 2 discusses major police interventions against booter providers and users.
- Section 3 describes the datasets used.
- Section 4 presents our negative binomial regression model and shows linkages between interventions and deviations from seasonal trends.
- Section 4.1 provides further analysis at the country level, including the impact of a UK-specific advertising campaign.
- Section 5 reviews related work.
- Section 6 discusses what makes for an effective police intervention.
- Section 7 draws conclusions.
- Ethical considerations are outlined in the Appendix.

## 2. The Interventions
Law enforcement can respond to cybercrime by arresting criminals, preventing involvement, disrupting harmful activities, and protecting potential victims. For example, the UK Home Office outlines a "Pursue, Prevent, and Protect" approach in their Serious and Organised Crime Strategy. We outline key interventions against booter services, their providers, and users from 2014 to 2019, based on Brian Krebs' blog and press coverage, with one additional event from within booter communities.

### 2.1 LizardStresser
In early 2015, the backend database of the LizardStresser booter service was leaked. On August 28, 2015, six UK individuals who had purchased attacks were arrested in "Operation Vivarium." Approximately 50 others who had registered with the site received a "cease and desist" home visit from UK police. Although merely registering at a booter is not an offense in the UK, the individuals were informed that DoS attacks are illegal and can cause significant financial and reputational damage.

One related court case involved a 17-year-old who pleaded guilty to a DoS attack and another offense, receiving a 12-month sentence in a young offenders' institution and ordered to pay over £1,000 in compensation to the victim. On October 6, 2016, two 19-year-olds were arrested in the US and the Netherlands for allegedly running the LizardStresser service. The American received a three-month prison sentence and was ordered to pay $350,000 in restitution after pleading guilty and cooperating with authorities.

### 2.2 Netspoof, etc.
On April 8, 2016, a 20-year-old man in the UK was sentenced after pleading guilty to six charges under the Computer Misuse Act and four under the Serious Crime Act. He had operated four booter services, including one called Netspoof, and received a two-year youth detention sentence, suspended for 18 months, 100 hours of unpaid work, and £800 in costs.

In December 2016, 12 people were arrested for purchasing DoS attacks on Netspoof, and 30 cease and desist notices were issued. This was part of a coordinated international action involving Europol and law enforcement from multiple countries, resulting in 34 arrests and 101 suspects being interviewed and cautioned.

### 2.3 HackForums & Mirai
On October 28, 2016, the "Server Stress Testing" section of HackForums, a large underground forum, was removed, and advertisements for booter services were banned. This decision followed a series of events, including the arrest of two Israeli men for operating the vDOS booter and the release of the Mirai botnet source code on HackForums. The ban left a gap in the market, leading to the creation of stresserforums.net, which closed in April 2018.

The Israelis were charged, and in the UK, a 19-year-old pleaded guilty to offenses related to vDOS, receiving a 16-month suspended sentence and 20 days of rehabilitation activity. In September 2018, three men aged 21 to 22 were sentenced for authoring and using the Mirai botnet, receiving five years of probation, 2,500 hours of community service, and ordered to pay $127,000 in restitution. One of the men received an additional sentence for DoS attacks against Rutgers University, including 2,500 hours of community service, six months of home confinement, and $8.6 million in restitution.

### 2.4 Titaniumstresser
In the UK, a 19-year-old received a 24-month sentence (reduced on appeal to 21 months) for operating the Titaniumstresser booter and committing 594 DoS attacks. The service was reportedly used for 1.7 million attacks. At a confiscation hearing, he was ordered to repay £69,629 in compensation or face an additional two years in prison.

### 2.5 Webstresser
On April 24, 2018, the domain for the Webstresser booter was seized, and its alleged administrators were arrested in the UK, Croatia, Canada, and Serbia. Europol reported that 250 UK users of Webstresser would receive police visits or warnings, and users in other countries would also be targeted.

### 2.7 NCA Google Search Advert Warnings
Following the HackForums ban, some booter services turned to Google search adverts to attract customers. From late December 2017 to June 2018, the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) bought search adverts warning young users on UK IP addresses of the illegality of DoS attacks when searching for booter-related terms. The aim was to divert people away from cybercrime by informing them of potential legal consequences.

## 3. Datasets
We use two datasets provided by the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre to measure the impact of police interventions on the number of DoS attacks by booter services.

### 3.1 Reflected Amplified UDP DoS Attacks
The first dataset includes reflected amplified UDP DoS attacks, where a small incoming UDP packet generates a much larger response. If the source IP of the original packet is spoofed, substantial amounts of traffic can be directed at a victim. The dataset covers victim IPs seen by a large number of honeypot machines roped into attacks using various protocols. For analysis, we group flows of packets to the same victim IP or prefix for the same protocol until there is a gap of at least 15 minutes with no packets being received by any sensor. If any sensor received more than five packets, it is deemed an attack; otherwise, the event is classified as a scan.

While this dataset counts traffic volume, we cannot reliably translate this into the traffic volume experienced by victims, so we focus on the number of attacks rather than their size. The dataset has limitations because not all reflected attacks are associated with booters, and booters can perform other types of attacks. However, we believe it is broadly representative of booter activity.

### 3.2 Self-Reported DoS Attack Numbers
The second dataset includes self-reported DoS attack numbers collected from booter websites, covering 75% or more of active booters over an 18-month period. Analysis of attack logs from prominent booters shows that over 70% of attacks were likely UDP reflection attacks. Krupp et al. attributed 26% of DNS and 13% of NTP attacks to specific booters they had purchased attacks from. Noroozian et al. found that over 48% of UDP reflection attacks and 62% of victims are on IP addresses in access networks. Sharma found that 89% of US, 98% of UK, 71% of FR, and 89% of DE victims were home users, and over 50% of attacks were less than five minutes. This pattern of behavior is consistent with booters, although other sources of UDP reflection attacks are included in the dataset.

## 4. Analysis
We present our negative binomial regression model and show several linkages between interventions and deviations from seasonal trends. Further analysis at the country level reveals the impact of a UK-specific advertising campaign.
