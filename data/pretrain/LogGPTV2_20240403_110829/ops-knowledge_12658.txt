User: Please explain the role of password hashing and provide a scenario for a password hashing scheme based on the following scenario: A website needs to store users' password information.
Assistant: Password hashing converts user passwords into irreversible strings to keep user passwords safe. When a user enters a password, the website hashes it and compares it to the hash value stored in the database. If the hashes match, the password is correct. If not, the password is wrong. An example of a password hashing scheme is hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm. When a user registers, the website passes the user's password to the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to convert it into a 256-bit long hash. The hash value will then be stored in the website's user database. When a user logs in, the website passes their password to the SHA-256 hash algorithm and compares the resulting hash with the hash stored in the database. If they match, the user can log in successfully.
