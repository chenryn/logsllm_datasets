## Abstract
Modern Internet streaming services have employed various techniques to enhance the quality of media delivery. While numerous studies have characterized media access patterns and user behaviors, few have focused on the streaming techniques themselves, particularly on the quality of experience they offer and the resources they consume.

To gain insights into current streaming services and provide guidance for designing resource-efficient and high-quality streaming systems, we collected a large dataset from thousands of broadband home and business users hosted by a major ISP. We analyzed commonly used streaming techniques such as automatic protocol switching, Fast Streaming, MBR encoding, and rate adaptation.

Our results show that these techniques often over-utilize CPU and bandwidth resources to improve service quality, which may not be an effective or desirable approach. Motivated by these findings, we propose and evaluate a coordination mechanism that leverages both Fast Streaming and rate adaptation to better utilize server and Internet resources for improved streaming quality.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet has seen a surge in multimedia content across various domains such as education, medical research, news, and entertainment. Although most media traffic is delivered via downloading, pseudo streaming, and P2P techniques, streaming services excel in handling concurrent streams, responding to network congestion, and providing high-quality performance. Streaming long-duration, high-quality media presents unique challenges:

1. **High and Stable Bandwidth**: Streaming services require consistent high bandwidth, which can degrade due to fluctuations, especially for high-quality video like HDTV.
2. **Diverse Network Connections**: Fixed encoding rates are not suitable for clients with varying network speeds.
3. **Startup Latency**: Users expect minimal startup delays, but server load and network dynamics can cause prolonged delays.

Commercial streaming services like Windows Media and RealNetworks have adopted techniques such as TCP-based streaming, Fast Streaming, MBR encoding, and rate adaptation to address these challenges. Despite their widespread use, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on their impact on streaming quality and resource utilization.

In this work, we collected a 12-day streaming media workload from a major ISP, covering thousands of broadband home and business users. Our key observations include:

- **Protocol Rollover Overhead**: Significant delays (over 22% longer than 5 seconds) occur when UDP is not supported.
- **Fast Streaming**: While it helps smooth re-buffering, it over-supplies data by about 55% and consumes more CPU resources.
- **MBR Encoding**: Widely used but poorly utilized, especially with Fast Streaming.
- **Quality Degradation**: About 13% of home and 40% of business sessions experience quality issues like re-buffering and lower quality streams.

These findings suggest that current streaming services over-utilize resources, leading to suboptimal experiences. We propose a Coordinated Streaming mechanism to improve quality while efficiently using resources.

## 2. Trace Collection and Processing Methodology
We collected streaming media packets from a major ISP's data center using the Gigascope appliance. The data center hosts servers for thousands of businesses and provides Internet access to a large cable company. We captured RTSP/MMS requests and UDP streaming traffic, grouping TCP packets by connections and extracting commands and media data. Our methodology was validated through extensive experiments on various media server and player products.

## 3. Traffic Overview
We captured 126 GB of streaming data over 12 days, involving 7,591 home users and 219 business users. Most traffic was delivered via Windows Media Services, with RealNetworks being the second most common. Video content dominated home user requests, while audio content was more prevalent among business users. TCP was the primary protocol for streaming traffic.

Figures 1(a) and 2(a) show the distribution of file lengths for on-demand audio and video objects requested by home and business users, respectively. Business users tend to request shorter audio and video files compared to home users.

[Figures 1(a) and 2(a) should be included here to illustrate the distributions.]

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our trace collection and processing methodology. Section 3 presents an overview of the collected workload. Sections 4, 5, and 6 analyze the delivery quality and resource utilization of streaming media services. Section 7 discusses the coordinated caching and rate adaptation mechanism. Related work is outlined in Section 8, and concluding remarks are made in Section 9.
