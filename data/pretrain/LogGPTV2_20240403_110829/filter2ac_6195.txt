**ATT&CK ID:** T1037.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Logon Script (Windows)

Adversaries may leverage Windows logon scripts, which are automatically executed during the logon initialization process, to establish persistence on a system. In Windows, logon scripts can be configured to run whenever a specific user or group of users logs in. This is achieved by adding the path to the script in the `HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript` Registry key.

### Key Points:
- **Persistence Mechanism:** Logon scripts are used to maintain access to a system.
- **Execution Timing:** Scripts are executed at the time of user logon.
- **Configuration Method:** The script path is added to the `UserInitMprLogonScript` Registry key under `HKCU\Environment`.

This technique allows adversaries to ensure that their malicious code is executed each time the targeted user logs into the system, thereby maintaining persistent access.
