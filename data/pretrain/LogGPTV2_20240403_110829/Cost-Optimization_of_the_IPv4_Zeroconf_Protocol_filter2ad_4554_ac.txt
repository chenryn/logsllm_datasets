Theorem for decomposable stochastic matrices [6].
For our particular case, we are actually only interested in
C(n, r) = a(n,r)
, the mean accumulated cost of the starting
state start. Due to the simple structures of the matrices
involved, we can derive a symbolic solution for C(n, r):

where πi(r) =

Section 3.2 that the πi(r) are determined by the defective
probability distribution FX describing the time to receive a
reply to an ARP probe.
4.2 Finding parameters for minimal cost
Equation (3) provides us with the principal means to look
into all the facets of C(n, r), the mean total initialization
cost of the IPv4 zeroconf protocol. It shows that C depends
on two types of parameters, namely the explicit parameters
n and r which are under the control of the designers of the
protocol, and the application speciﬁc parameters c, q, E,
and FX which can be predicted by the protocol designers to
only a very limited extent.
We can now identify two different ways to study the
function C(n, r). One may either ﬁx the protocol by ﬁx-
ing n and r, and then perform a sensitivity analysis with
respect to one of the remaining, application speciﬁc, param-
eters. Or one may ﬁx an application scenario by ﬁxing c, q,
E, and FX, and strive for an optimal setting of the proto-
col parameters n and r. The earlier approach is a standard
exercise, and we return to this strategy in Section 4.5 where
we discuss the parameters c and E, and in Section 6. Here
we instead focus on the optimization aspect. We formulate
the optimization problem as follows. For ﬁxed c, q, E, and
FX, we intend to ﬁnd the pairs (n, r) ∈ IN × IR+ such that
C(n, r) is minimal.
The parameter n is discrete, and thus we can deﬁne
C(n, r) as a family of functions {Cn}, where Cn(r) :=
C(n, r). We are interested in the shape of Cn, describing
the mean cost as a function of r when n has been ﬁxed. The
ﬁrst question of interest concerns the shape Cn of this func-
tion. Due to our assumption of a defective distribution FX
we have limr→∞ FX(r) = l. It is not difﬁcult to verify that
in this case πi(0) = 1 and that limr→∞ πi(r) = (1−l)i, for
i = 1, . . . , n. Moreover, πn(r) falls off polynomially with
degree n. As a consequence, Cn(0) = qE, and for r → ∞,
Cn(r) is approaching the asymptote

.
Apparently, the cost function Cn is a mixture of the linearly
increasing function An and the polynomially decreasing
qEπn(r). As long as we can assume that An(r) << qE
for small r (which is realistic, since we assume E to be
rather large), we can also assume that Cn(r) ﬁrst falls off
polynomially to a minimum, and increases then linearly, as
r increases.
opt such that Cn(r(n)
To address the above optimization problem we are
searching for the number r(n)
opt) is mini-
mal. Computing r(n)
opt is best done by numerical means. It is
possible to use the derivation of the cost function and to de-
rive the zeroes, or to compute the minimum by some other
means. From a numerical point of view this is not partic-
ularly challenging, and we will therefore not dwell on the
solution aspects of the model. All numeric results and ex-
ample plots in this paper have been computed numerically
by means of the Maple2 tool.
4.3 Example plots
In this section, we will show some sample graphs for
Cn. To do so, we ﬁrst have to ﬁx the parameters c, q, E,
as well as the probability distribution FX (cf. Section 3.2)
for the time between sending an ARP probe and receiving
a reply. As mentioned earlier, FX should be based on mea-
sured data. Since we do not heave measures at hand, and
we want to demonstrate the principle rather than to produce
exact results in a particular setting, we decide to deﬁne FX
on the basis of an exponential distribution.

where 1 − l is the probability that an ARP probe never gets
a reply, d is the round-trip delay of the considered network,
and d+1/λ is the mean time a reply is received after sending
the ARP probe, assuming that the reply does not get lost. In
the following, we choose d = 1, l = 1−10−15, and λ = 10.
For the probability q that an IP address is in use we choose
q = 1000/65024. For the cost of sending an ARP probe
we assume c = 2, and for E, the cost of an erroneously
accepted IP address, we choose E = 1035. In Figure 2, we
show some examples plots of cost functions Cn(r) for n =
1, . . . , 8. Actually, the functions for n = 1, 2 are not visible,
since their smallest values are much too large to ﬁt into the
chosen range of the plot. As we can see, the cost functions
indeed all have a minimum. The higher n is chosen, the

smaller r(n)
The increase of the minimum of the cost function Cn(r) for
larger n is mainly caused by the postage c. If we would
set c = 0, then the optimal strategy would be to send as
many ARP probes as fast as possible, without waiting for
a reply. Then the probability that at least one reply returns
d seconds (the roundtrip delay) after sending the ﬁrst ARP
probe approaches one. Since in the real world the sending
of a packet incurs some nonzero cost, this strategy is not
recommendable.

4.4 Optimal n
Up till now, we have only considered the optimal value
of r for a particular n. In this section, we want to address the
question what n should be chosen for a given r, such that
the cost is minimal. Therefore, we now deﬁne a function
N : IR −→ IN, that returns the optimal number n that min-
imizes C(n, r) for ﬁxed r: N(r) = min{ n ∈ IN | Cn(r) =
inf k∈IN{Ck(r)}}.
By means of N(r) we can now deﬁne Cmin(r) =
C(N(r), r). Cmin describes the total cost of a protocol run
under the condition that always an optimal n has been cho-
sen for a given r. Figure 4 depicts a graph of Cmin, based on
the same parameters chosen for Figure 2. Cmin is described
by the lower edge of the union of all function graphs of the
Cn. From the cost function, a rough estimate for the number

Figure 3. N(r): optimal n for given r
N(r) can be derived. As we have seen above, the cost func-
tion is a mixture of a linearly increasing and a polynomially
decreasing function in r. To have the costs small, the poly-
nomial part (i.e., qEπn(r)) should approach a number close
to zero for increasing r. This can however only be achieved,
if the inﬂuence of the cost parameter E is dwarfed by πn(r).
As limr→∞ πn(r) = (1 − l)n, we have that (1 − l)nqE
should be near to zero. Therefore, the minimal value of n is

For all n(cid:1) < ν we can be sure that qEπn(cid:1)(r) will never
approach zero. We now have another explanation why the
graphs for n = 1, 2 are not visible in Figure 2: since E =
1035 and 1 − l = 10−15, we have
= 3, and
therefore, it is impossible to achieve a reasonable cost, if
n = 1, 2.

4.5 Cost of error
In [2], several assumptions are made about the parame-
ters of the protocol. The maximal number n of ARP probes
is set to n = 4. The waiting time r between the probes
is set to r = 2 or r = 0.2. The round-trip delay is as-
sumed to be maximally one second, the network speed min-
imally 1 Mbit/sec. No assumptions are made about the ex-
pected number of hosts on the link. We must assume that
the chosen parameters cover the worst case with respect to
speed, reliability, network size, and trafﬁc. Up till now we
have only assumed arbitrary values for the cost variable E.

Figure 5. Probability to reach state error
An interesting question is what values the cost parameter
E and the postage c must have such that the assumptions
made in [2] become reasonable, i.e., that n = 4 and r = 2
(r = 0.2) are the optimal choice with respect to cost min-
imization. This is addressed as follows. We choose very
pessimistic parameters for l and q, and compute E and c for
both values of r, which we will denote by Er=2, Er=0.2,
cr=2, and cr=0.2. For the loss probability l we choose
l = 1 − 10−5, which for modern networks is very high.
We assume that 1000 hosts are already connected to the
network, i.e., q = 1000/65024, and a worst-case round-
trip delay of 1 second, i.e., d = 1. The mean time un-
til a reply is received after an ARP probe has been sent is
