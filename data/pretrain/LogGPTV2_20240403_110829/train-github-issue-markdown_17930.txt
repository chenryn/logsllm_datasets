 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
This problem occurs in sqlalchemy 4.7.1, using oracle 9.
Case scenario:  
I had a job table, and a task task, and a jabs2tasks table to create a many to
many relation. I created a job and a task, and added the job twice to the task
(using a relation that have a secondary). len(task.jobs) returned 2. Then I
saved the task and commited.  
I was expecting that an exception would be thrown, but it didn't. When I
looked in at jobs2tasks in my SQLNavigator, I saw that only one entry was
enetered.
The problem is, that this behaviour is not expected. When I try to enter, for
example, a task that already exists in the db (the same task_id), sqlalchemy
throw a constraint exception. I think that this is exactly the same case, but
with a complex primary key.
