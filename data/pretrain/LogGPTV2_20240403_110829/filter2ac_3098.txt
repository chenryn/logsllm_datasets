### Title: Unveiling the Dark Sides of Java Remote Protocols: RMI and CORBA

Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) are widely used mechanisms for inter-process communication. In this talk, we will delve into the technical workflows of these technologies, uncovering several critical vulnerabilities and highlighting how vendors often fail to secure their implementations.

While there have been previous studies on the subject, we believe that the full extent of their exploitability remains underexplored. We will present a range of known, lesser-known, and previously unknown exploitation techniques, including overlooked 1-day and 0-day vulnerabilities, to illustrate the significant attack surfaces in the protocols' implementations. This will be demonstrated through a series of pre-authentication, remote code execution exploits on products from some of the largest vendors in the industry.
