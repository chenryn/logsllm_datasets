In type.less, I've found it would be useful for the **unstyled** and
**inline** to be mixins, rather than developers having to reimplement such
things when using LESS.
For example, I'm styling a horizontal navigation bar but I have to reimplement
the stylings of **ul.inline** from _type.less_ into my LESS file, which could
easily be replaced with a mixin.
