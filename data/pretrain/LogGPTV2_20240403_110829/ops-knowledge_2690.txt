Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of deleting an instance and creating a new one. The first log line shows a request to retrieve server details. The next few lines show the instance being deleted, with the hypervisor taking 1.02 seconds to destroy the instance and 0.58 seconds to deallocate the network. The next log line shows a request for server details again. The following log line shows an exception being thrown due to no instances being found. The next few lines show an unknown base file being removed from the image cache. The last few lines show a new instance being created, with the hypervisor attempting to claim memory, disk, and vcpus, and displaying the total memory and memory limit.
