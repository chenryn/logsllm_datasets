The include/exclude clause used in aggregations like _terms_ agg uses regex
syntax to identify terms.  
While this offers a lot of flexibility for matching, the list of terms
supplied by a user is sometimes a fixed set of raw values and it is:  
a) inconvenient for the user to have to escape these strings into "legal"
regex patterns and  
b) inefficient to parse and interpret these as regex patterns when a simple
hashset would suffice
The proposed change is the addition of a "values" array to both _include_ and
_exclude_ clauses:
    "terms" : {
        "field" : "domains.raw", 
        "include" : {
            "values":  [ "http://www.foo.com", "http://www.bar.com"]
        }
    }
This can be used in conjunction or instead of the existing "pattern" clause in
a search. If an include or exclude statement contains a mix of regex
("pattern") and exact ("values") clauses then this would be a logical OR - a
match on the regex clause OR the exact value clause would constitute a match.
@clintongormley you may have some input on this?
