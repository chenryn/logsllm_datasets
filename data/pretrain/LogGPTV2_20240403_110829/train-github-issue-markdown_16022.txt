Hello, I've been using the search engine with powertoys run a lot. Something
I've noticed is that every time I try and run an application I use less
frequently, the search engine only brings up files with a similar name,
essentially every program I have installed has smaller bin with the same name.
It would be incredible if there was a way to prioritize programs that are
installed onto my disc, because right now I have my search engine set to only
show 6 results, and very often, not a single one of those 6 are my
application.
