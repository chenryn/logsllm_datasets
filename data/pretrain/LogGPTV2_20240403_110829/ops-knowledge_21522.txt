User: I have a problem that comes from me following tutorials without really understanding what I'm doing. The root of the problem I think is the fact that I don't understand how the OS X filesystem works. 
The problem is bigger than Python but it was when I started learning about Python that I realized how little I really understand. So in the beginning I started following tutorials which led me to use the easy_install command a lot and when a lot of tutorials recommended PIP I never got it running. So I have run a lot of commands and installed a lot of different packages.
As I have understood Lion comes with a python install. I have been using this a lot and from this I have installed various packages with easy_install. Is there any way to go back to default installation and begin from the very beginning? Is this something I want to do? If so why?
Is there any advantage of using a Python version I have installed with Homebrew? How can I see from where Python is run when I run the Python command?
When I do install something with either easy_install, homebrew, macports etc where do things actually end up?
Assistant: The advantage of using a Python installed via a package manager like Homebrew or MacPorts would be that this provides a simple way of removing the Python installation and reinstalling it. Also, you can install a more recent version than the one Mac OS X provides.
