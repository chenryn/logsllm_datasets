**Title: Black Hat US-19: Making Big Things Better the Dead Cow Way**

Transforming the security culture within a single company can be an overwhelming task. The Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) managed to revolutionize the entire security industry. In this session, three pivotal members from the 35-year-old group—Mudge Zatko, Chris Rioux, and Deth Vegetable—will delve into the cDc's journey from teenage misfits to industry leaders. They will explore the group's significant contributions and the lasting lessons for other hackers aiming to make a difference. The discussion will be moderated by Joseph Menn, author of "Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World," published on June 4.

For the first time, cDc's Minister of Propaganda, Deth Veggie, will appear under his real name. He will share insights into the group's formative years and how he strategically engaged with the media to achieve both fame and notoriety. After gaining recognition, the Cult of the Dead Cow attracted tech luminaries like Zatko and Rioux, who further propelled the industry forward through a series of groundbreaking initiatives.

In 1999, Rioux's release of Back Orifice 2000 compelled Microsoft to address the concerns of its business customers and hire hackers as security consultants, including those from Zatko and Rioux's @stake. Zatko later led cybersecurity grantmaking at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the organization that developed the internet. Rioux co-founded Veracode, which significantly enhanced code review processes for major software buyers.

Throughout these developments, Deth Veggie continued to play a crucial role within the cDc, driving conversations in politically charged areas such as hacktivism, WikiLeaks, the hacker aspect of the #MeToo movement, neo-Nazis, and the presidential campaign of cDc alumnus Beto O'Rourke.
