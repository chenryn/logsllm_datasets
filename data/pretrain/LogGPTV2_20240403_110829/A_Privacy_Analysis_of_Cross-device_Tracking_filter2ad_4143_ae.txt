or device on which such data was collected.” [21] In order
to examine the level of compliance with this transparency
requirement we randomly selected 40 DAA member ad
networks that advertised their cross-device capabilities on
their websites and analyzed their privacy policies.
We found that 23 disclosed their cross-device tracking
activities while 17 omitted those. After contacting the latter,
we received a response from seven. Two pointed us to docu-
ments that were linked from the policy that indeed contained

device company wrote that their cross-device functionality is
not yet fully rolled out to clients, and three others announced
that they will change their policy (one of those still has to
follow through). Another representative simply claimed that
the company is “not violating anything.” Without contacting
us five further cross-device companies simply changed their
policies, of which four became compliant. Finally, there was
no reaction or policy change from five. As of June 9, 2017
we count a total of eight instances of non-compliance.
Overall, it appears that there is a lack of transparency
when it comes to the disclosure of cross-device tracking.
At this point, the DAA guidance does not seem to be
enforced rigorously. While it may be true that the majority of
consumers will not take the time to understand the tracking
practices described in privacy policies,14 we think that it is
still a worthwhile endeavor for cross-device companies to
properly disclose their practices, particularly, for audit and
enforcement purposes as well as for signaling trustworthiness
to the marketplace and to build an environment of rules and
norms in privacy disclosure.
As cross-device tracking continues to mature and become an
integral part of tracking on the Internet we believe that a com-
prehensive view including legal and business considerations
is helpful. Establishing an enforceable self-regulatory frame-
work for companies to be transparent about their practices
will help to protect consumer privacy and allow cross-device
companies to conduct their businesses responsibly.
Ultimately, cross-device tracking is part of a larger
trend:
the Internet of Things (IoT). In this regard, we
see cross-device tracking as an early harbinger of the
increasing inter-connectivity of devices.
Increasingly,
buildings, cars, appliances, and other things are connected
to the Internet and are interacting with other online devices.
However,
the development and deployment of privacy
solutions has to keep pace with the emerging IoT landscape.
Ensuring transparency and practicable control mechanisms
for information that is traversing device boundaries and
permeates between the online and offline worlds is a critical
element. Given standardized interfaces [43], perhaps, an
intelligent personal privacy assistant that is connected to all
services and devices of person could be a solution.
9 Conclusion
Acknowledgment
Cross-device tracking is an emerging tracking paradigm that
challenges current notions of privacy. This study is intended
as a broad overview of selected privacy topics in mainstream
cross-device technologies. In a brief case study we have
demonstrated how cross-device tracking can be observed
with statistical confidence by means of an information flow
experiment. Using our own cross-device tracking dataset
we designed a cross-device tracking algorithm and evaluated
relevant features and parameter settings grounded in a
review of publicly available information on the practices of
cross-device companies. For some predictive tasks it appears
that those companies can learn more about users than from
individual device data. As the penetration of cross-device
tracking on the Internet already appears relatively high it is
even more important that companies active in this field are
transparent about their practices.
Going forward we hope that the various privacy implica-
tions of cross-device tracking technologies will be studied fur-
ther. In this regard, proprietary research is substantially ahead
of current efforts in academia. While a few major points are
known—for example, that IP addresses are a crucial fea-
ture for correlating devices—many important details on how
cross-device companies operate remain opaque. To shed
more light on the subject we publicized our dataset together
with the software that we developed for further exploration.
14Using tracking protection software and ad blockers is a much more effi-
cient approach from a user perspective. Thus, when evaluating cross-device
tracking in terms of a threat model, the most effective defense would be
to block tracking. In this regard, the defenses against cross-device tracking
are the same as the defenses against the tracking of individual devices.
