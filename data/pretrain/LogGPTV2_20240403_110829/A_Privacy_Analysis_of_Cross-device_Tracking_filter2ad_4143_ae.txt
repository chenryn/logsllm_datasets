### Transparency in Cross-Device Tracking: An Analysis of DAA Member Ad Networks

To assess the level of compliance with transparency requirements, we randomly selected 40 ad networks that are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and that advertise their cross-device capabilities on their websites. We then analyzed their privacy policies to determine if they disclosed their cross-device tracking activities.

#### Findings
- **Disclosure Status**: Out of the 40 ad networks, 23 provided clear disclosures about their cross-device tracking activities, while 17 did not.
- **Follow-Up Actions**:
  - **Initial Contact**: We reached out to the 17 non-disclosing companies. Seven responded to our inquiry.
  - **Compliance Adjustments**:
    - Two companies directed us to additional documents linked from their privacy policies, which contained compliant descriptions.
    - One company stated that their cross-device functionality was not yet fully rolled out to clients.
    - Three companies committed to updating their policies, though one has yet to follow through.
    - Another company claimed that they were "not violating anything."
  - **Unsolicited Changes**: Five companies updated their policies without being contacted, with four becoming compliant.
  - **No Response**: Five companies did not respond or make any changes to their policies.

As of June 9, 2017, there were a total of eight instances of non-compliance.

#### Overall Observations
The findings suggest a lack of transparency in the disclosure of cross-device tracking practices. The DAA guidance does not appear to be rigorously enforced. While it is true that most consumers may not read or understand the detailed tracking practices described in privacy policies, proper disclosure remains essential for audit and enforcement purposes, as well as for building trust and establishing norms in privacy disclosure.

#### Future Considerations
As cross-device tracking continues to evolve and become an integral part of internet tracking, a comprehensive approach that includes legal and business considerations is necessary. Establishing an enforceable self-regulatory framework will help protect consumer privacy and allow companies to conduct their businesses responsibly.

Cross-device tracking is part of a larger trend known as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, cross-device tracking can be seen as an early indicator of the increasing interconnectivity of devices. As more buildings, cars, appliances, and other objects connect to the internet, the development and deployment of privacy solutions must keep pace with the emerging IoT landscape. Ensuring transparency and practicable control mechanisms for information that crosses device boundaries and permeates between the online and offline worlds is critical. Standardized interfaces, such as an intelligent personal privacy assistant connected to all services and devices, could be a potential solution.

### Conclusion
Cross-device tracking challenges current notions of privacy. This study provides a broad overview of selected privacy topics in mainstream cross-device technologies. Our case study demonstrates how cross-device tracking can be observed with statistical confidence through an information flow experiment. Using our own dataset, we designed a cross-device tracking algorithm and evaluated relevant features and parameter settings based on publicly available information on cross-device companies' practices. For some predictive tasks, these companies can learn more about users than from individual device data. Given the high penetration of cross-device tracking on the internet, it is crucial that companies in this field are transparent about their practices.

Future research should further explore the privacy implications of cross-device tracking technologies. Proprietary research is currently ahead of academic efforts, and while some major points are known, many details remain opaque. To shed more light on the subject, we have made our dataset and software available for further exploration.
