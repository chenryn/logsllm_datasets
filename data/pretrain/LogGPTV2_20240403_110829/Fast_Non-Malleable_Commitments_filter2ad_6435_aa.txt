ABSTRACT
The notion of non-malleability in cryptography refers to the
setting where the adversary is a man-in-the-middle (MIM)
who takes part in two or more protocol executions and tries
to use information obtained in one, to violate the security
of another. Despite two decades of research, non-malleable
commitments (NMCs) have remained too ineﬃcient to be
implemented in practice, without some sort of trusted setup.
In this work, we give a fast implementation of NMC in
the plain model, based on the DDH assumption being hard
over elliptic curve groups. Our main theoretical result is
a new NMC scheme which can be thought of as a “high
dimensional” generalization of the one in the recent work
of [GRRV14]. Central to our eﬃciency improvements is a
method of constraining challenges sent by the receiver. This
new approach enables us to obtain dramatically improved
parameters over those suggested in [GRRV14]. In particu-

lar, our work opens the door to implementations based on
Elliptic Curves.
Our prototype implementation gives evidence of our pro-
tocol’s eﬃciency. Additionally, like the Elgamal commit-
ment it is built on top of, our scheme allows for homom-
rphic operations on committed values, and is amenable to
fast Schnorr proofs of knowledge. Thus, it will work well
when used as a building block inside larger cryptographic
protocols. As an example of its performance, our protocol
allows a committer to commit to a 1.9−KB message using
a scheme supporting 220 identities in less than one second.

INTRODUCTION
Secure computation was introduced in the 1980s and still
remains an active area of research. Over the years classical
feasibility results [Yao86, GMW87, BGW88] have given way
to constructions which are both more eﬃcient and which
satisfy stronger notions of security.
In recent works we
have seen a push towards obtaining “practice-oriented” pro-
tocols [IKO+11, Lin13, FJN+13, LR14, AMPR14] (and the
references there-in). Several concrete secure computation
systems building upon these improvements have been imple-
mented (e.g. the JustGarble system [BHKR13]). The goal
of this work is to initiate and promote the study of non-
malleable commitments from the practical eﬃciency per-
spective.
1.1 Non-Malleable Commitment
Non-malleable cryptography models the scenario where
the adversary is a man-in-the-middle (MIM) who partici-
pates in two or more instantiations of a protocol and tries to
use information obtained in one execution to harm the secu-
rity of another. Many tasks in cryptography are susceptible
to such an attack, and thus non-malleable security arises
1048naturally in many settings (e.g. commitment, encryption,
coin-ﬂipping witness-indistinguishable and zero-knowledge
proofs, etc.). Interest in non-malleable security is motivated
both by the strong security guarantees it provides, and by
the unfortunate reality that many widely used protocols are
actually highly malleable.
Non-malleable commitment (NMC), introduced by Dolev,
Dwork and Naor [DDN91], is especially well studied, and has
proven to be an immensely useful primitive. Very brieﬂy we
say that a commitment scheme is non-malleable if for ev-
ery message m, no MIM adversary, intercepting a commit-
ment Com(m) and modifying it at will, is able to eﬃciently
generate a commitment to a related message ˜m. NMC is
extremely versatile and is often used as a building block in
more complex protocols. For example, it is known how to
use NMC to construct several other non-malleable primitives
such as zero-knowledge proofs.
Because of its applications across cryptography, the ef-
ﬁciency of NMC has been studied extensively. Beginning
with [DDN91], who gave a protocol for NMC with O(log n)
rounds, research over the last two decades has improved
the round complexity from logarithmic to constant [Bar02,
PR05, Goy11, LP11] and recently to just 4 rounds [GRRV14].
However common to most of these works is that they use
computationally heavy tools (such as generic zero-knowledge
proofs) leading to quite ineﬃcient protocols. The focus of
our work is on obtaining eﬃcient non-malleable commit-
ments, usable in practice.
1.2 Motivation
Constant Round Multi-Party Computation. Non-malleable
commitments are important building blocks in round-eﬃcient
multi-party computation (MPC) protocols. Without some
form of non-malleability, any MPC protocol must have round
complexity that is at least linear in the number of parties,
since in protocols with sublinear round complexity, multiple
parties must commit to their inputs in parallel. When the
fraction of corrupt parties is less than 1/2, one can use in-
formation theoretic veriﬁable secret sharing (VSS). However
when the corruption threshold increases above 1/2, infor-
mation theoretic techniques fail and cryptographic subpro-
tocols are needed.
It is known how to construct constant
round MPC protocols with high corruption tolerance using
constant round NMC [Pas04, Wee10, Goy11] (essentially by
replacing the VSS with NMC). Traditionally VSS is thought
to be much more eﬃcient than NMC, however in this work
we give evidence that this isn’t the case. Our prototype
implementation has computation and communication com-
plexity which is comparable with that of widely used VSS
schemes. In this way our work allows one to increase the
corruption tolerance of an eﬃcient MPC scheme above 1/2
without incurring a penalty.
Composable Security. Another application of NMC is
to the area of secure protocol composition [DNS98, Fei90,
Can01]. So far, all work on eﬃcient secure computation
that we are aware of focuses on the standalone setting. De-
signing protocols which are secure in the more demanding
(though realistic) models which allow for protocol composi-
tion is vastly more diﬃcult. Over the past decade [CLOS02,
BS05, Goy12] has shown that non-malleability lies at the
heart of protocol composition; MIM attacks seem to be the
most devastating. Our work takes an important step toward
the goal of attaining eﬃcient protocols which are provably
secure in composition.
Sigma Protocols. Probably the most useful aspect of
the Elgamal commitment scheme is its seamless compatibil-
ity with Schnorr proofs of knowledge, thus allowing a com-
mitter to prove knowledge of his committed value, or that
two committed values are equal.
In fact, the recent work
of [AMPR14] shows that these plus several other techniques
“go all the way” to an eﬃcient protocol for general 2PC.
Our NMC prototype is instantiated on top of the Elgamal
commitment scheme and inherits all of the fast Σ−protocols
available to the original. NMC is most commonly used as a
subprotocol, so compatibility with usual cryptographic op-
erations is an important feature. Such compatibility is not
oﬀered by most schemes which use a random oracle.
Comparison with NMC in the Random Oracle Model.
Prior to this work, we are not aware of any attempts to
implement non-malleable commitments in the plain model.
In part this is because such a simple solution exists in the
random oracle model: Com(m; r) = H(m, r) where H is
the random oracle. However our construction has some ad-
vantages over this trivial one. First, our implementation is
provably secure under well understood and widely accepted
assumptions. This is in contrast to the random oracle heuris-
tic which is known to break down as soon as the random or-
acle is replaced by a speciﬁc hash function. Second, as men-
tioned above, our protocol is compatible with fast proofs of
knowledge of committed values and Σ−protocols for prov-
ing that these values satisfy certain relations. The above
and other random oracle constructions (such as the recent
one from [CJS14]) need to use cut-and-choose techniques
for such proofs, which introduces extra rounds of interac-
tion and requires more communication than our protocol.
1.3 Results
The recent work of [GRRV14] gives a relatively simple,
round-eﬃcient NMC. However (as remarked by the authors),
the proof of non-malleability requires choosing parameters
which are much too large to be used in practice. In fact, at-
tempting to instantiate their protocol with more reasonable
parameter choices opens the door to actual attacks. Exact
communication/computation complexities are shown in Ta-
ble 2, but just to give an idea: one execution of the protocol
instantiated over the DDH group Zq with 2−80 security and
supporting 216 identities (for background on the identities,
see Section 2.4) requires the committer to compute about
4000 exponentiations in Zq where q is a 6000−bit prime. In
this work we give a new NMC scheme which is similar to that
of [GRRV14] (in particular, it is provably secure in the plain
model) but has much better performance. For example, for
the security and identity parameters mentioned, our scheme
requires C to compute fewer than 600 exponentiations in
elliptic curve over GF (p), where p can be few hundred bit
prime of our choice. 1
Theorem 1. There exists a four-round, statistically bind-
ing, non-malleable commitment scheme which, when instan-
1R has to compute many more exponentiations than C in
the na¨ıve protocol. However, since these are during the veri-
ﬁcation phase, optimization techniques such as batching are
available to reduce R’s workload considerably.
1049tiated over any DDH group, requires C (resp. R) to perform
18k (resp. 4k2) exponentiations where k is the length of
identities supported (in bits). Furthermore, all of R’s expo-
nentiations take place during the decommitment phase (and
so may be done oﬄine, and are subject to optimizations).
Our prototype implementation is instantiated over an ellip-
tic curve group G and is secure assuming that DDH is hard
over G. This is the ﬁrst implementation of a NMC scheme
whose proof of security does not use random oracles, or some
other form of trusted setup. Our implementation capitalizes
on several optimizations. For example, we use batching to
reduce the computation complexity of the receiver during
veriﬁcation to below what are shown in Table 2. Speciﬁc
performance numbers for a variety of parameters is shown
in Table 1.
We stress that our scheme can be instantiated over any
DDH group; it does not place restrictions on the size of the
group. See Table 2 for more eﬃciency-related information.
Additionally, we note that our new scheme is general (it
can be instantiated from any one-way function), and though
we have chosen to focus on a DDH−based instantiation, it
could be implemented, giving similar results, starting from
any homomorphic commitment scheme.
Next we increase the message space of our new NMC
scheme. The basic protocol allows a committer C to com-
mit to a vector m ∈ Z(cid:96)
q where q is any prime speciﬁed by the
the protocol and (cid:96) depends linearly on the length of iden-
tites the scheme can support (for most choices of q, (cid:96) = 2k
where the scheme can support 2k identities is natural). The
overall communication complexity of our scheme, however, is
Ω(k2 log q), meaning that our rate (i.e., the message length
1
Ω(k) . This
divided by the communication complexity) is
is lower than we would like, especially since there are well
known ordinary commitment schemes with constant rate.
It turns out that increasing the rate of NMC can be done
trivially: simply commit non-malleably to a short seed s,
then use s to encrypt (malleably) a longer message m. This
construction, however, destroys the structure of the NMC
scheme in the sense that any fast Σ−protocols available to
the original NMC needn’t (and likely will not) be compatible
with the high rate NMC. For example, if the NMC protocol
of Theorem 1 is instantiated on top of the Elgamal com-
mitment scheme it inherits homomorphic operations and
Schnorr-like Σ−protocols for proving that the committed
value satisﬁes a linear relation. However, if the amortiza-
tion technique just mentioned is used on top to increase the
message size, these fast proofs are lost. This lack of compati-
bility with common cryptographic operations severely limits
the utility of this NMC when used as a building block for
larger protocols. We show that our scheme is amenable to
an amortization technique which is as eﬃcient as the general
one, and which also preserves the Σ−protocols available to
the original.
1.4 Central Idea: From Subsets to Subspaces
Our techniques expand on the algebraic techniques put
forth in [GRRV14]. Brieﬂy recall their scheme.
1. C → R commitments to the coeﬃcients of n linear
polynomials all with the same constant term. We
denote the i−th polynomial fi(x) = rix + m where
m ∈ Zq is the value C is committing to non-malleably,
and the ri ∈ Zq are random.
2. R → C a random query vector α = (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ Zn
q .
3. C → R response vector a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈ Zn
q where
ai = fi(αi).
4. C proves to R in ZK that the values sent in step 1 are
valid commitments, consistent with the responses in
step 3.
Crucial for the proof of non-malleability is the fact that
the challenges αi are actually drawn from proper subsets
Vi ⊂ Zq, the sizes of which depend on C’s identity. Since
C’s identity and M’s identity are distinct, M will be asked
queries from diﬀerent challenge spaces than he will be al-
lowed to use to query C. It is then possible to show that
by carefully controlling the Vi, M will not be able to use
C’s answer to construct his own, and thus the protocol is
non-malleable.
