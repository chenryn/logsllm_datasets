User: What is MySQL's master-slave replication? In what scenarios do we need to use master-slave replication?
Assistant: MySQL master-slave replication is a database replication technology that allows a database to replicate data between multiple server nodes. In master-slave replication, one MySQL server is designated as the master node, and other MySQL servers (i.e., slave nodes) replicate data from the master node. Any changes to the master node are automatically replicated to the slave nodes. Master-slave replication is usually used in the following scenarios: 1. Improve performance and scalability: Through master-slave replication, read operations can be distributed to slave nodes, thereby reducing the load on the master node. Slave nodes can be easily added in case the database performance needs to be expanded. 2. Backup and recovery: Through master-slave replication, data can be backed up from the master node to the slave node, and the data can be restored when the master node fails. 3. Data distribution: Through master-slave replication, data can be replicated to servers in different geographical locations, thus providing better performance globally. 4. Disaster recovery: In the event of a catastrophic failure of the master node, the slave node can take over from the master node to ensure the availability and data integrity of the database.
