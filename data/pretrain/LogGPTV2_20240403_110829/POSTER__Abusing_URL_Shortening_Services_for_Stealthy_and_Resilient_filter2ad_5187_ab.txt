“hidden”  URL.  In  the  last  report  Global  Phishing  Survey, 
such use plummeted to only 270 attacks in the first semester 
of  2013,  sharply  down  from  785  in  the  second  semester  of 
2012.  Unfortunately,  the  phishers  have  come  back  to  using 
this technique again, with 999 such phishing attacks detected 
in the second semester of 2013. 
IV.  ADOPTED APPROACH 
In order to evaluate the user perspective in relation to short 
URLs, a survey was conducted aimed at creating a baseline 
assessment of the most frequent use of shortened URLs, user 
confidence and user awareness on the risks associated. 
The  Survey  Questionnaire  was  conceived  based  on  the 
"intelligence led policing" approach, in the sense that in the 
order  to  take  appropriate  prevention  actions,  you  should 
profile  the  users  and  conceive  prevention  products  on 
shortened URLs which are addressed to a specific type of user 
or a specific type of user activity (i.e. social networking site, 
e-mails etc.). The Questionnaire is structured in two sections: 
general questions and specific questions. 
A.  General Questions 
The general questions are aimed at defining the profile of 
the subject who is taking the survey. In order to achieve these 
two questions were devised; one connected to the amount of 
time the user spends on the Internet and the second on the area 
of interest while browsing.  
The  first  question  focuses  on  the  time  spent  online  since 
this  can  be  an  indicator  as  to  the  frequent  use  of  multiple 
Internet  services  and  the  probability  of  using  an  URL 
shortening service.  
The  second  question  is  aimed  at  identifying  the  frequent 
area  of  interest  of  the  subjects  who  are  taking  part  in  the 
survey  so  that  appropriate  measures  can  be  devised  later  in 
relation to cybercrime prevention material.  
B.  Specific Questions 
The second part of the Questionnaire is composed of three 
groups  of  question  that  address  three  main  issues:  (i)  the 
frequency  of  use  of  URL  Shortening  Services;  (ii)  user 
confidence as well as (iii) user awareness on the risks that one 
is  exposed  to  when  accessing  a  Shortened  URL.  Details  of 
these questions are described as below. 
The first group is intended to provide an understanding on 
how often and in relation to which Internet services (i.e. web 
browsing,  social  networking  sites  etc.)  the  subjects  of  the 
Survey  make  use  of  short  URLs.  The  Internet  services 
mentioned  in  the  Questionnaire  were  added  based  on  a 
previous paper [4] released in May 2011 referring to security 
implications of URL shortening services. 
The  second  group  approaches  the  user  confidence  in 
utilizing  short  URLs.  One  question  attempts  to  identify  the 
typology of URL shortening services a person is more at ease 
with using, either well known services or a specific shortening 
service.  Another  question  is  aimed  at  determining  the 
subject's  perception  of  the  safety  when  using  a  short  URL. 
Associated  to  this  is  one  more  question  that  inquires  the 
subject as to how he or she perceives the measures taken by 
URL shortening services in order to protect users of Internet 
security risks (i.e. malware, spam etc.). The final question in 
relation to user confidence is a composite question made up of 
three  different  indicators  with  reference  to  a  short  URL, 
respectively 
and  popularity.  The 
measurement of the indicators gives out an overall perception 
as to certain characteristics of short URLs which make them a 
better option of choice for Internet users. 
stability, 
lifetime 
The 
the  final  part  of 
third  group  makes  up 
the 
Questionnaire  that  addresses  the  subject's  perception  on  the 
risks he or she is exposed to when utilizing short URLs. This 
group  begins  with  a  general  assessment  on  the  level  of  risk 
perceived by the subject of the Survey in relation to the use of 
short URLs. One question in this group touches upon the most 
frequent security risks associated with the use of short URLs 
(i.e. malware, phishing, spam) identified in previous papers as 
well  as  articles  and  it  tries  to  determine  the  level  of 
acknowledgement  on  the  risks  from  the  side  of  the  survey 
subject. Another question goes one step further and puts into 
discussion the issue of specific software products installed on 
the  subject's  machine  in  order  to  avoid  security  risks  when 
using short URLs. There are two questions that aim at creating 
a minimum level of awareness on the risk potential of short 
URLs through the examples of phishing and malware: 
1)  First  question  refers  to  an  observation  [10]  included  in 
the  Global  Phishing  Survey  of  semester  2  of  2013 
mentioning  that  approximately  51%  of  all  of  the 
malicious shortened URLs used for phishing were found 
at a single provider (i.e. tinyURL.com). 
2)  Second question refers to a situation from 2009 when the 
URL shortening service Cligs was hacked [11]. Yet, the 
hacking of the Cligs URL shortening service has puzzled 
security researchers. Instead of pointing to a spamming 
related site, the redirect was executed towards a harmless 
Register site. One of the theories explaining the strange 
redirect  which  was  advanced  by  a  senior  technology 
consultant  for  SophoLabs  was  that  the  hacker  rerouted 
users to the Orange County Register site by mistake. At 
the  time  of  the  hack,  Cligs  was  ranked  as  number  four 
most  popular  URL  shortening  service  used  on  Twitter. 
Despite  the  inconvenience  and  possible  loss  of  tens  of 
thousands  of  URLs,  security  experts  had  said  that  the 
attack could have been much worse as the hackers could

have redirected millions of shortened URLs to a website 
hosting malware. 
The  final  question  in  the  third  group  addresses  the 
important issue of protection measures that can be taken by 
users in order to avoid malicious security threats associated 
with short URLs. To this end, this question inquires about the 
suitability of a list of protection options which can be easily 
put into practice by users with basic IT skills, such as: 
1) 
2) 
installing a Site Advisor software [12] 
installing an Add-on in the web browser which allows the 
user to view the long URL instead of the shortened URL 
of websites; 
3)  previewing the web sites where short URLs redirect with 
specialized web services before accessing them. 
Although  the  Questionnaire  is  conceived  as  one  which 
should  be  accessible  to  Internet  users  with  all  levels  of 
technical  skills,  for  specific  questions  there  is  also  an 
additional  option  mentioned  in  certain  questions  which  is  a 
free text option (i.e. “other, please specify...”) which is aimed 
at  more  advanced  Internet  users  who  can  give  a  more 
thorough  description  of  their  experience  when  using  short 
URLs. 
survey subjects are likely to provide an objective overview on 
the use of short URLs since they spend more time on the Web. 
The  second  question  addressed  the  issue  of  the  frequent 
areas of interest on the Internet. The first 3 choices were made 
up  of  34%  of  the  respondents  who  provided  feedback  that 
they are interested in checking their e-mail accounts, 28% of 
the subjects who mentioned they are interested in news sites 
and 25% of the subjects who mentioned they have an interest 
in social networking sites (Fig. 1). 
Fig. 1. Proportion of areas of interest on the internet. 
Therefore  any  prevention  material  on  the  topic  of  short 
V.  EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS 
URLs should be addressed to these 3 categories of services. 
A.  Experiments 
The Survey was applied on a number of 100 people in the 
age range 28 - 50. The nationality of the subjects was broadly 
distributed among the 28 European Union Member States. 
The  Questionnaire  was  distributed  in  electronic  format 
over a period of 5 days. 
As mentioned above, the Questionnaire was divided into a 
general  questions  section  with  a  view  of  determining  the 
subjects' preferences and Internet usage patterns as well as a 
specific questions section in order to address. 
Following  the  distribution  of  the  Questionnaire  and  the 
receipt of the filled in documents, the results were analyzed 
based on the initial three goals of the survey: 
1) 
frequency of use; 
2)  user confidence; 
3)  user awareness; 
When utilizing short URLs on the Internet. 
Although all 100  people  (so-called  subjects)  returned  the 
filled  in  Questionnaire  in  electronic  format,  a  number  of  9 
participants to the survey mentioned that they never use short 
URLs  and  therefore  did  not  continue  with  filling  in  the 
Questionnaire.  Hence,  these  9  subjects  only  provided 
feedback on the first 3 questions of the survey. 
Therefore a number of 91 subjects responded to all of the 
questions  included  in  the  survey,  answers  which  will  be 
analyzed in the following sections. 
B.  General Questions 
Based  on  the  answers  to  general  questions  by  the 
participants  to  the  Questionnaire,  the  following  conclusions 
were made available on the subjects of the Survey. 
C.  Frequency of Use of Shortened URLs 
When asked how often they use short URLs, out of the 100 
survey  participants,  55  responded  that  they  rarely  use  these 
types of URLs, 21 responded that they use them every day, 15 
provided  feedback  that  they  use  them  once  every  couple  of 
days and 9 persons replied that they never use short URLs. 
Fig. 2. Proportion of services where short URLs are used on the internet. 
Out of the 91 persons who replied they use short URLs, the 
largest proportion 51% use them on Social Networking Sites 
followed closely by 32% of the subjects who use them while 
accessing various websites. This tendency is in line with the 
main  aim  of  short  URLs  which  was  to  counter  restrictions 
imposed  by  Social  Networking  sites  however  it  reveals  an 
interesting  development  in  the  use  of  short  URLs  on  other 
web  pages  and  e-mails.  Specifically  this  shows  that  the 
proportion  of  use  of  short  URLs  is  propagating  to  other 
services  on  the  Internet  which  means  a  higher  coverage  by 
short URLs and increased risks for users (Fig. 2). 
The majority of the subjects 34% spend 1 - 2 hours daily on 
the Internet daily followed by 33% who spend 2 - 4 hours on 
the  Internet.  These  figures  provide  an  indication  that  the 
In an attempt to identify the Social Networking Site where 
short URLs are more frequently utilized, 48% of the subjects 
use short URLs on Facebook (Fig. 3). 
Journal of Advances in Computer Networks, Vol. 3, No. 3, September 2015216 
This proportion reflects on the  one  side  the  expansion  of 
the  social  networking  platform  Facebook;  however  on  the 
other side is a signal of the popularity of the short URLs which 
have begun to be adopted equally by other platforms. 
opinions  on  three  characteristics  of  short  URLs  specifically 
stability, lifetime and popularity, which are indirectly related 
to user confidence. Although when asked how they would rate 
the  stability  and  lifetime  of  short  URLs,  the  majority  of 
participants to the Survey rated them as moderate, in terms of 
popularity of short URLs most users rated them as good - 46% 
and 18% rated them as very good (Fig. 5). 
Fig. 3. Proportion of social networking sites where short URLs are used. 
D.  User Confidence in Accessing Short URLs 
In  terms  of  user  confidence  when  it  comes  to  shortening 
services  providers,  the  participants  were  quite  straight 
forward. 
When asked which short of URLs they are more confident 
in using, 70% of the Survey participants answered that they 
feel  more  confident  in  using  URLs  from  well-known 
shortening services (i.e. goo.gl, bit.ly, t.co, ow.ly, tinyurl.com) 
and  the  rest  of  the  subjects  mentioned  that  it  doesn't  matter 
which URL shortening service the link refers to. 
This could be an indication for the URL shortening services 
with  the  highest  number  of  accessed  links  to  step  up  their 
measures in providing safe URLs for their users. 
An  important  observation  as  to  user  perception  of  safety 
when  utilizing  short  URLs  can  be  seen  in  the  replies  to 
question related to the ranking of using short URLs. None of 
the  subjects  ranked  the  safety  a  very  good.  Out  of  the  91 
subjects who use short URLs, the majority of the respondents 
- 42 - pointed out that the safety can be ranked as moderate 
followed by 33 subjects who ranked it as poor (Fig. 4). This 
shows a certain user awareness as to the risks which can occur 
when utilizing short URLs.  
The following question addresses the people perception on 
the measures taken by URL shortening services to deliver risk 
free  short  URLs.  Approximately  57%  of 
the  survey 
participants 
as  moderate  and 
approximately 30% considered the measures as poor.

Fig. 5. Rating of stability, lifetime and popularity of short URLs. 
From  the  assessments  of  the  three  characteristics  and 
corresponding charts, we can draw the conclusion that users 
are  not  currently  very  concerned  about  the  stability  and 
lifetime of short URLs; however they do agree that these types 
of  URLs  are  popular.  This  aspect  would  leave  room  for 
significant improvement in future awareness papers on short 
URLs to focus on the issue of stability (i.e. broken links etc.) 
as well as lifetime (i.e. availability of the short URL). 
E.  User Awareness When Using Short URLs 
As mentioned in the previous chapter of the paper, the final 
part  of  the  Questionnaire  addresses  the  issue  of  user 
awareness on the risks that one is exposed to when accessing a 
Shortened URL. 
Based on the replies of the subjects, out of the 91 users of 
short  URLs,  45  of  the  respondents  (approximately  49%)
