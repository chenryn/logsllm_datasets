### Hidden URLs in Phishing Attacks

In the most recent Global Phishing Survey, the use of hidden URLs in phishing attacks plummeted to just 270 incidents in the first half of 2013, a significant drop from the 785 attacks recorded in the second half of 2012. Unfortunately, phishers have resumed this technique, with 999 such attacks detected in the second half of 2013.

### Adopted Approach

To evaluate user perspectives on short URLs, a survey was conducted to create a baseline assessment of the most frequent uses of shortened URLs, user confidence, and awareness of associated risks.

#### Survey Questionnaire Design

The questionnaire was designed based on the "intelligence-led policing" approach, which emphasizes the need to profile users and develop targeted prevention measures for specific types of users or activities (e.g., social networking, emails). The questionnaire is divided into two sections: general questions and specific questions.

##### A. General Questions

General questions aim to define the profile of the survey participants. Two key questions were included:
1. **Time Spent Online**: This question assesses the amount of time users spend online, as it can indicate the likelihood of using multiple Internet services and URL shortening services.
2. **Areas of Interest**: This question identifies the areas of interest while browsing, allowing for the development of appropriate cybercrime prevention materials.

##### B. Specific Questions

The specific questions address three main issues:
1. **Frequency of Use of URL Shortening Services**: This group aims to understand how often and in what contexts (e.g., web browsing, social networking) users utilize short URLs.
2. **User Confidence**: These questions gauge the level of trust users have in short URLs, including their preference for well-known services and their perception of safety.
3. **User Awareness of Risks**: This section explores users' understanding of the risks associated with accessing shortened URLs, including malware, phishing, and spam.

### Evaluation and Analysis

#### A. Experiments

The survey was administered to 100 participants aged 28-50, with a broad distribution across 28 European Union Member States. The questionnaire was distributed electronically over five days.

#### B. General Questions

Based on the responses to the general questions, the following conclusions were drawn:
- **Time Spent Online**: The majority of respondents (34%) spend 1-2 hours daily on the Internet, followed by 33% who spend 2-4 hours.
- **Areas of Interest**: 34% of respondents are interested in checking email accounts, 28% in news sites, and 25% in social networking sites (Fig. 1).

**Figure 1. Proportion of areas of interest on the internet.**

#### C. Frequency of Use of Shortened URLs

- **Usage Frequency**: Out of 100 participants, 55 rarely use short URLs, 21 use them daily, 15 use them every few days, and 9 never use them.
- **Usage Context**: Among the 91 users of short URLs, 51% use them on social networking sites, and 32% use them while accessing various websites (Fig. 2).

- **Social Networking Sites**: 48% of users employ short URLs on Facebook (Fig. 3).

#### D. User Confidence in Accessing Short URLs

- **Confidence in Providers**: 70% of participants feel more confident using URLs from well-known shortening services (e.g., goo.gl, bit.ly).
- **Perception of Safety**: None of the 91 users ranked the safety of short URLs as very good. 42 respondents rated the safety as moderate, and 33 rated it as poor (Fig. 4).

- **Measures Taken by Providers**: Approximately 57% of participants rated the measures taken by URL shortening services as moderate, and 30% considered them poor.

#### E. User Awareness When Using Short URLs

- **Risk Awareness**: Out of the 91 users, 45 (approximately 49%) acknowledged the risks associated with short URLs, including malware, phishing, and spam.

### Conclusion

The survey provides valuable insights into the use of short URLs, user confidence, and risk awareness. It highlights the need for improved education and preventive measures, particularly focusing on the stability and lifetime of short URLs. Future awareness campaigns should address these aspects to enhance user safety and reduce the risks associated with short URLs.
