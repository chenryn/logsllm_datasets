User: I am not able to install OpenStack. I executed the script stack.sh and there was Error on exit. I looked at the log, the error is during the execution of the command: sudo -H -E python /home/sagar/devstack/files/get-pip.py : 
This is the error during the execution of the below command:
sudo -H -E python /home/sagar/devstack/files/get-pip.py
