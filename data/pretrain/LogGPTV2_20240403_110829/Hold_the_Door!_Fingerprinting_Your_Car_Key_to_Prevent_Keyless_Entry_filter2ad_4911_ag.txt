device with identical components as a target key fob is required
to impersonate its kurtosis feature. Even if two devices are
designed with identical components, as mentioned above, they
have different bit times with each other, which are represented
by peak frequency. Accordingly,
if the kurtosis feature is
successfully impersonated by using a device with identical
components, its attack would be detected based on the different
peak frequency of an attack signal.
C. Concern for Practicality
Although we evaluated HODOR under various environmen-
tal conditions, some results seem still
insufﬁcient for the
practical usage of HODOR. It has been shown that HODOR
has a relatively high FPR under dynamic conditions and
temperature variation. Other than the conditions where we
evaluated HODOR, more extreme environments certainly do
exist that adversely affect accuracy. For this reason, HODOR
should be further studied to develop additional features and
algorithms that properly operate even in extreme environments.
Subsequently, other processes will be performed together with
HODOR to unlock doors. Regarding the total execution time
for a door unlock command, HODOR should also be improved
to shorten execution time. Otherwise, a driver may sense a
lag when he/she attempts to unlock the doors. As a result,
HODOR should be further studied to resolve these practical
issues. Through our future research, it is expected that HODOR
will improve and achieve the requirements for practical usage.
D. Scalability
SNR. Even though the SNR feature is effective in detecting
single-band relay attacks, an adversary can impersonate the
The concept that analyzes RF signals can be applied to
other modulations for secure proximity and distance measure-
16
ment. However, such analysis is beyond the scope of this
paper and further research on the characteristics of baseband
signals generated by other modulations is required. We suspect
that HODOR may be applicable in other modulations for
secure proximity and distance measurement since the hardware
characteristics of an attack device and channel conditions affect
the features.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented HODOR as a sub-authentication
system that supports manufacturer-installed support systems
to prevent keyless entry system car theft. HODOR is an RF-
ﬁngerprinting method that distinguishes a legitimate door un-
lock request from a malicious attempt. Through our evaluation,
we showed that HODOR is able to effectively detect simulated
attacks that are deﬁned in our attack model, while reducing the
number of erroneous detection occurrences (i.e., false alarms).
Furthermore, we found a set of suitable features in a number
of environmental conditions, such as temperature variation,
battery aging, and NLoS conditions, that make it possible for
HODOR to properly operate in real-life environments. Finally,
one especially noteworthy merit of HODOR is its design. It is
designed such that it can be applied into an existing system
without any hardware modiﬁcations. The only requirement for
successful implementation is to add a device to sample UHF-
band RF signals and analyze them. This novel characteristic
of our method means that HODOR improves security without
creating additional cumbersome or inconvenient processes for
the user.
