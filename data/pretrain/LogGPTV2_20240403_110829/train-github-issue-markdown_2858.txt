While attempting to load the CRNN model from Meijieru using OpenCV, I encountered the following error:

```python
import cv2
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromTorch("crnn.pth")
```

Error message:
```
OpenCV(4.2.0) C:\projects\opencv-python\opencv\modules\dnn\src\torch\torch_importer.cpp:1022: error: (-213:The function/feature is not implemented) Unsupported Lua type in function 'cv::dnn::dnn4_v20191202::TorchImporter::readObject'
```

### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** 4.2.0
- **Operating System/Platform:** Windows 64-bit

### Question
How can I resolve this error?

### Suggested Solution

The error indicates that the `readNetFromTorch` function in OpenCV 4.2.0 does not support the Lua type used in the `crnn.pth` model. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Model Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that the `crnn.pth` model is compatible with the version of OpenCV you are using. The model might be in a format that is not supported by `readNetFromTorch`.

2. **Convert the Model:**
   - If the model is in a Torch/Lua format, you may need to convert it to a format that OpenCV supports, such as Caffe or ONNX.
   - You can use tools like `torch2caffe` or `onnx` to convert the model.

3. **Update OpenCV:**
   - Consider updating to a newer version of OpenCV, as the support for different model formats and features is continually improving.

4. **Alternative Libraries:**
   - If the above steps do not work, you might want to consider using other libraries that support loading and running Torch models, such as PyTorch itself.

5. **Example Conversion (Torch to ONNX):**
   - Convert the Torch model to ONNX format and then load it using OpenCV's `readNetFromONNX` function.

Here is an example of how you might convert a Torch model to ONNX and load it in OpenCV:

```python
# Convert Torch model to ONNX
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

# Load your Torch model
model = models.resnet18()  # Replace with your model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("crnn.pth"))

# Export the model to ONNX
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # Adjust input size as needed
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "crnn.onnx", verbose=True)

# Load the ONNX model in OpenCV
import cv2
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromONNX("crnn.onnx")
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully load the CRNN model in OpenCV.
