User: I just started using git to get my the code I write for my Master-thesis more organized. I have divided the tasks into 4 sub-folders, each one containing data and programs that work with that data. The 4 sub-projects do not necessarily need to be connected, none off the programs contained use functions from the other sub-projects. However the output-files produced by the programs in a certain sub-folder are used by programs of another sub-folder. 
In addition some programs are written in Bash and some in Python. 
I use git in combination with bitbucket. I am really new to the whole concept, so I wonder if I should create one "Master-thesis" repository or rather one repository for each of the (until now) 4 sub-projects. Thank you for your help!
Assistant: Well, as devnull says, answers would be highly opinion based, but given that I disagree that that's a bad thing, I'll go ahead and answer if I can type before someone closes the question.  :)
I'm always inclined to treat git repositories as separate units of work or projects.  If I'm likely to work on various parts of something as a single project or toward a common goal (e.g., Master's thesis), my tendency would be to treat it as a single repository.
And by the way, since the .git repository will be in the root of that single repository, if you need to spin off a piece of your work later and track it separately, you can always create a new repository if needed at that point.  Meantime it seems "keep it simple" would mean one repo.
