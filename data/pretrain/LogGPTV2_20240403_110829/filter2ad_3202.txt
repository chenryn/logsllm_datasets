Abstract 
Resources 
Data-intensive collaborative data sciences can benefit 
substantially from software-defined networking (SDN) 
and network functions (NF). Unified SDN programming, 
which integrates states of network functions into SDN 
control plane programming, brings these two 
technologies together. However, integrating 
asynchronous, continuously changing states of network 
functions into SDN can introduce basic complexities: (1) 
how to naturally integrate network function state into 
SDN programming; (2) how to flexibly construct 
consistent, correlated routes to utilize network function 
state; and (3) how to handle dynamicity of unified SDN 
programming. We design Trident, the first unified SDN 
programming framework that introduces programming 
primitives including stream attributes, route algebra 
and live variables to remove these complexities.  
Goals 
The demonstration will use one DTN and one switch in 
the Caltech booth at SC18 exhibit floor. These devices 
will be connected to the Caltech SDN testbed located at 
Pasadena, California, via a 100 Gbps WAN circuit, 
provided by SCinet, CenturyLink and CENIC Los Angeles. 
In the SDN testbed, three switches and two DTNs will be 
used. 
The demonstration of Trident programming framework 
contains following aspects:

  We demonstrate the capability of the Trident 
programming framework to integrate NF and 
SDN. Specifically, we program the network with 
a simple SDN onPacket program with the ability 
to read the high-level information of a stream, 
such as URI, and decide the route based on 
these information. By integrating the network 
control in an SDN controller and the flow 
inspection in a network function, this program 
showcases how powerful the Trident 
framework is. 
  We demonstrate the capability of the Trident 
programming framework to handle the 
dynamicity, such as link failures. In such cases, 
Trident re-computes the route automatically 
without requiring a network operator to 
manually handle such dynamicity, e.g., 
implementing an onDataChangeListener 
function.
