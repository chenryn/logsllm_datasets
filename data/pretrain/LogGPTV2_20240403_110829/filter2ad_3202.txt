### Abstract

Data-intensive collaborative data sciences can significantly benefit from software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions (NF). Unified SDN programming, which integrates the states of network functions into the SDN control plane, brings these two technologies together. However, this integration introduces several complexities:

1. **Integration of Network Function State**: How to naturally integrate the asynchronous, continuously changing states of network functions into SDN programming.
2. **Route Construction**: How to flexibly construct consistent, correlated routes that utilize the state information of network functions.
3. **Dynamicity Handling**: How to handle the dynamic nature of unified SDN programming.

To address these challenges, we have designed Trident, the first unified SDN programming framework. Trident introduces programming primitives such as stream attributes, route algebra, and live variables, which help in managing these complexities.

### Goals

The demonstration will use one Data Transfer Node (DTN) and one switch at the Caltech booth on the SC18 exhibit floor. These devices will be connected to the Caltech SDN testbed located in Pasadena, California, via a 100 Gbps WAN circuit provided by SCinet, CenturyLink, and CENIC Los Angeles. In the SDN testbed, three switches and two DTNs will be used.

The demonstration of the Trident programming framework will cover the following aspects:

### Demonstration Aspects

1. **Integration of NF and SDN**:
   We will demonstrate the capability of the Trident programming framework to integrate network functions (NF) and SDN. Specifically, we will program the network using a simple SDN `onPacket` program that can read high-level information from a stream, such as URI, and decide the route based on this information. By integrating network control in an SDN controller and flow inspection in a network function, this program showcases the power of the Trident framework.

2. **Handling Dynamicity**:
   We will demonstrate how the Trident programming framework can handle dynamic events, such as link failures. In such cases, Trident automatically recomputes the route without requiring a network operator to manually intervene, for example, by implementing an `onDataChangeListener` function.

### Network Configuration

- **Exhibit Floor**: One DTN and one switch
- **Caltech SDN Testbed**: Three switches and two DTNs
- **WAN Circuit**: 100 Gbps provided by SCinet, CenturyLink, and CENIC Los Angeles
- **Location**: Caltech booth, SC18 exhibit floor, Pasadena, California

This setup will allow us to showcase the robustness and flexibility of the Trident framework in a real-world environment.
