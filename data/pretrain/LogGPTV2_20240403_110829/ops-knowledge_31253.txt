User: Please design the system architecture and implementation scheme according to the following application design requirements. It is required to develop a multiplayer online game, support at least 10,000 online players, and require real-time update of player status and game progress. At the same time, game servers are required to have high scalability and fault tolerance, and support automatic deployment and horizontal expansion.
Assistant: System architecture design: 1. Adopt micro-service architecture and divide the game server into multiple independent services to reduce the coupling between services and facilitate horizontal expansion. 2. Use load balancing technology to evenly distribute requests to each server to achieve high availability. 3. Use message queue technology to transmit player status and game progress to each server in real time, so as to realize real-time update. Specific implementation plan: 1. Use the Spring Cloud framework to build a microservice architecture, and deploy it using Docker containerization technology to facilitate automatic deployment and horizontal expansion. 2. Use Nginx as a load balancer to distribute requests to different service nodes. 3. Use Kafka as a message queue to transmit player status and game progress to each server in real time. For the server node, the WebSocket protocol is used to realize two-way communication to ensure real-time performance. 4. In order to ensure the fault tolerance of the service, the Hystrix fuse mechanism and Spring Cloud Ribbon are used for service degradation and automatic retry, and the sub-database and sub-table technology is used on the database side to improve the performance and reliability of data access.
