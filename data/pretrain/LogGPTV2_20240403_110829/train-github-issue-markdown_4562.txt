It is unclear in the prompt whether the test function `sym(A, B, C, D, E, F)`
is requesting the user to create a function that accomplishes:
`return A △ B △ C △ D △ E △ F`  
OR  
`return ((((A △ B) △ C) △ D) △ E) △ F`
The syntax difference is important. For the following test case:
`A = [3, 3, 3, 2, 5] B = [2, 1, 5, 7] C = [3, 4, 6, 6] D = [1, 2, 3], E = [5,
3, 9, 8] F = [1] should return [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
The first version I mentioned (the symmetric difference of ALL ARRAYS) would
return  
`[4, 7, 8, 9]`
Whereas the second returns  
`[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
I'm just wondering if we could make this clearer in the instructions?
**Technically** , the instructions
`Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the
symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of the provided arrays.`
actually ask for the first version, not the second version, and according to
my limited programming and mathematics knowledge, the test cases are wrong ...
Maybe someone can clarify this?
