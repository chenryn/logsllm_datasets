User: does it take the filename of the .py and then what?
Assistant: It takes any options for python.exe itself, then the name of the file (or command or module), then any arguments to be passed to your program.
If no file is specified, it puts you in interactive mode.
As indicated in the comments by Adam, type python -h to see the full list.
