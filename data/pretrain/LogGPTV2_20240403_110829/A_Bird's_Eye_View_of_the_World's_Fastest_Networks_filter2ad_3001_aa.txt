## Abstract
Low latency is critical for various applications, with the most stringent requirements found in financial trading, where sub-microsecond differences can be decisive. This has driven firms in the financial technology sector to push networking technology to its limits, providing a glimpse into the future of consumer-grade terrestrial microwave networks. In this study, we explore the competitive landscape of network design over the past decade, focusing on the Chicago-New Jersey trading corridor. We systematically reconstruct licensed financial trading networks from publicly available data and analyze their latency, path redundancy, wireless link lengths, and operating frequencies.

## 1. Introduction
Many Internet applications are highly sensitive to latency. For popular web services, a few hundred milliseconds of latency can significantly impact revenue [10, 15]. In gaming, tens of milliseconds can greatly affect player competitiveness [47]. Augmented and virtual reality [26] have even more stringent requirements. However, the most latency-sensitive application is financial trading, where sub-microsecond latency differences matter.

High-frequency trading (HFT) involves rapid placement and removal of orders in response to changing market conditions. HFT participants aim to obtain and act on market information as quickly as possible, thus minimizing all sources of latency. Many HFT strategies focus on scenarios where information originating at one location can be acted upon at a geographically distant location. HFT often creates winner-takes-all scenarios, where the first player to reach the distant financial center reaps all the rewards [28]. This has led to fierce competition among traders for the fastest possible connectivity between financial centers. "Fastest" here primarily refers to latency, as messages are small—each unique trading activity translates to only 2 bits of information sent over the network [34].

The fastest HFT networks use line-of-sight radio connectivity instead of fiber. An end-to-end connection between two financial centers comprises a series of point-to-point connections between radios mounted on tall towers, each functioning as a simple repeater. This strategy allows financial centers to connect along nearly the shortest possible paths on the Earth's surface, whereas fiber routes tend to be circuitous. Radios also avoid the delay caused by the speed of light in fiber, which is only approximately \( \frac{2c}{3} \), rather than \( c \). Different networks between the same endpoints compete fiercely for favorable tower sites that result in shorter paths [5], and to a lesser extent, for suitable radio spectrum licensing.

While HFT networks are highly specialized, they are worth studying for several reasons:
- They represent the fastest wide-area networks in existence, making them an interesting subject for networking researchers.
- These networks have a significant impact on today's financial markets, generating immense public interest and numerous widely read articles [3–5].
- The cutting-edge technology used in HFT networks may eventually make its way into more consumer-focused networks.
- The varied design strategies in HFT networks hold lessons for other settings.

We explore the design of networks in the world's busiest financial trading corridor: Chicago–New Jersey. On one end lies the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) data center in Aurora, Illinois [12]. On the other end are the Equinix NY4 data center in Secaucus, NJ [38]; the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) data center in Mahwah, NJ [39]; and the NASDAQ data center in Carteret, NJ [36]. The Equinix NY4 data center hosts an electronic trading platform for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which also operates several important equity exchanges at NY4.

We use the frequency licenses filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to study these networks. Our contributions include:
- Building a tool to reconstruct the HFT networks in the Chicago–New Jersey corridor, outputting human-readable YAML files with tower coordinates, heights, link lengths, and operating frequencies. The tool and reconstructed networks are available online [14].
- Conducting a longitudinal analysis of the evolution of these HFT networks over the last 8 years, showing how certain networks improve while others decline.
- Identifying the fastest 3 networks as of April 1, 2020, and noting that the rankings are still in flux despite the long period of competition.
- Analyzing several present-day HFT networks and comparing their design strategies, drawing takeaways for building future low-latency terrestrial networks.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Data Sources
Companies operating licensed microwave links between towers within the US must file with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [20] and get approval to use specific operating frequencies between communication endpoints. Each license file provides information such as the license granting and cancellation dates, transmitter and receiver endpoint coordinates, and operating frequencies. The FCC's Universal Licensing System (ULS) [25] offers various license search interfaces, including:
- Geographic [22]: Allows searches for licenses within a specific radius of a location.
- Site-based [24]: Allows searches based on radio service codes and station classes.
- Licensee name [21]: Allows searches based on the name of the licensee.
- License details [23]: Provides details based on license ID.

### 2.2 Data Scraping
Using a combination of the different types of license search tools, we first broadly identify candidate licensees and then examine the set of licenses for each to determine if they form an end-to-end network of interest.

High-volume trading activities occur between the CME in Aurora, IL, and the NASDAQ [36], NYSE [39], and Equinix NY4 [38] in New Jersey, roughly 1,100 km to the east. We use the Geographic license search to find all licenses within a 10 km radius of the CME data center. Next, we use the Site-based search interface to select licenses with a radio Service Code 'MG' (Microwave Industrial/Business Pool) and an assigned station class 'FXO' (Operational Fixed). This set of licenses includes every potential HFT conventional microwave network reaching the CME, uncovering 57 candidate licensees.

We filter out those with fewer than 11 license filings, as the geodesic distances between the CME and New Jersey data centers exceed 1,100 km, implying that 10 or fewer towers would require inefficiently long microwave links. This leaves us with 29 licensees for further analysis.

Our data scraping tool collects the following information for each license ID:
- **License grant date**: Date when the license was formally granted by the FCC.
- **License cancellation date**: Date when the license was cancelled by the licensor or licensee.
- **License termination date**: Date when the license is terminated if not cancelled or extended.
- **Tower endpoints**: Coordinates and altitude of the towers involved.
- **Operating frequencies**: List of frequencies used by the transmitter to communicate with each receiver.

Uncovering 'real' names: Some entities do not file for licenses using their actual company names due to commercial competition. For example, little information is available online about Jefferson Microwave, Pierce Broadband, and Webline Holdings, but license file details [18, 19] and other sources [5] hint at their connections to well-known ultra-low latency network providers. We use the licensee names as found in the FCC portal.

### 2.3 Network Reconstruction
Our tool can reconstruct a network at any arbitrary date in the past using its licensing information. We assume that if a license is active (granted but not terminated/cancelled) and forms part of an end-to-end path, its microwave links are active. This is a reasonable assumption as tower acquisition and rental are difficult and expensive [3, 4], and a license is tied to fixed endpoint coordinates.

We reconstruct entire networks by stitching together individual links: a tower that is an endpoint for two links forms a node connecting these links. An end-to-end network requires not only tower-to-tower links but also short fiber segments connecting the last tower on each side to its corresponding data center. We assume that data centers have fiber connectivity to nearby (up to 50 km away) towers [4], and that this short fiber segment follows the geodesic, i.e., the shortest path on Earth's surface.

We estimate one-way end-to-end latencies between data centers based on path lengths divided by the speed of light. The microwave part of the path is traversed at the speed of light in air, approximately \( c \), while the fiber segments are traversed at roughly \( \frac{2c}{3} \). Some networks have multiple paths between the same two data centers, so we use Dijkstra's algorithm (accounting for the different speeds of light in air and fiber) to construct the lowest-latency route through each network. This approach does not capture overheads from signal repetition or regeneration at towers, which we briefly address in terms of the number of tower hops in §3.
