ABSTRACT
Low latency is of interest for a variety of applications. The most
stringent latency requirements arise in financial trading, where sub-
microsecond differences matter. As a result, firms in the financial
technology sector are pushing networking technology to its limits,
giving a peek into the future of consumer-grade terrestrial mi-
crowave networks. Here, we explore the world’s most competitive
network design race, which has played out over the past decade on
the Chicago-New Jersey trading corridor. We systematically recon-
struct licensed financial trading networks from publicly available
information, and examine their latency, path redundancy, wireless
link lengths, and operating frequencies.

1 INTRODUCTION
Many Internet applications are highly sensitive to latency. For pop-
ular Web services, a few hundred milliseconds of latency translate
to significant changes in revenue [10, 15]. For gaming, tens of mil-
liseconds imply large differences in player competitiveness [47].
Augmented and virtual reality [26] have even tighter requirements.
Perhaps the most latency-sensitive application, however, is financial
trading, where sub-microsecond latency differences matter.
High frequency trading (HFT) is a form of algorithmic trading
that involves rapid placement and removal of orders in response to
changing market conditions. HFT participants strive to obtain and

act on market information as quickly as possible, and thus seek to
minimize all sources of latency.
Many HFT strategies focus on situations in which information
that originates at one location can be acted upon at a geographically
distant location. HFT often engenders winner-takes-all scenarios,
where the first player to reach the distant financial center reaps
all the rewards [28]. This has created fierce competition among
traders for the fastest-possible connectivity between financial cen-
ters. “Fastest” here refers primarily to latency, as messages are
small — each unique trading activity translates to only 2 bits of
information sent over the network [34].
The fastest HFT networks eschew fiber in favor of line-of-sight
radio connectivity. An end-to-end connection between two financial
centers comprises a series of point-to-point connections between
radios mounted on tall towers. Each tower functions as a simple
repeater. This strategy allows financial centers to connect along
nearly the shortest-possible paths on the Earth’s surface, whereas
fiber routes tend to be circuitous. Radios also avoid the delay caused
by the speed of light in fiber which is only (roughly) 2c
3 , rather than
c. Different networks between the same two end-points compete
fiercely for favorable tower sites that result in shorter paths [5],
and to a lesser extent, for suitable radio spectrum licensing.
We acknowledge that HFT networks are highly specialized and
are at best, a fringe segment of the Internet. Nevertheless, we posit
that it is worth studying these networks for several reasons:
• These are the fastest wide-area networks in existence, and thus
an interesting artifact for networking researchers. While our
community has ambitiously put forth “speed of light networking”
agendas both in data centers [45] and across the Internet [43],
HFT networks already operate as close to that bound as is real-
istically possible today [34].
• There is no question that these networks have a huge impact
on today’s financial markets, regardless of whether this impact
is positive [9, 11] or negative [35, 42]. There is thus immense
public interest in these networks, engendering numerous widely
read “popular science” articles [3–5], but no systematic study
or easy-to-use public datasets.
• The bleeding edge technology may make its way into more
consumer-focused networks. While microwave-based network-
ing is old [13], the improvements in radios due to the HFT use
case have enabled wider use in rural connectivity [29]. A pro-
posal for a “speed of light Internet” [8] has also drawn on the
HFT-engendered radio improvements.
• The varied design strategies pursued in HFT networks hold
lessons for other settings as well, as we discuss later.

We thus explore the design of networks operating in the world’s
busiest financial trading corridor: Chicago–New Jersey. On one end
of this corridor lies the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) data
center located in Aurora, Illinois [12]. On the other end are the
Equinix NY4 data center located in Secaucus, NJ [38]; the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) data center in Mahwah, NJ [39]; and the
NASDAQ data center in Carteret, NJ [36]. The Equinix NY4 data
center hosts an electronic trading platform for the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE) which also owns and operates several
important equity exchanges located at NY4.
We use the frequency licenses these US-based networks file with
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to study their
design. We make the following contributions:
• We built a tool to reconstruct the HFT networks in the Chicago–
New Jersey corridor. It outputs the networks as human-readable
YAML files, incorporating information about tower coordinates
and heights, link lengths, and operating frequencies. Our tool,
and the reconstructed networks and their visualizations, are
available online [14].
• We conduct a longitudinal analysis, studying the evolution of
these HFT networks over the last 8 years. Our analysis shows
how certain networks improve over time while others perish.
• We identify the fastest 3 networks, as measured by path length,
as of 1st April, 2020. We find that the rankings are still in flux,
which is interesting, given the long period over which networks
have been competing towards a (fixed) best-possible goal.
• We analyze several present-day HFT networks, and show how
they differ in their network design strategies. From this com-
parison, we draw takeaways for building future low-latency
terrestrial networks.
2 METHODOLOGY
We first discuss our data sources, along with data scraping, re-
construction, and visualization of networks. We also discuss the
assumptions involved.
2.1 Data sources
Companies operating licensed microwave links between towers
within the US need to file with the Federal Communications Com-
mission (FCC) [20] and get approval to use specific operating fre-
quencies between the communication endpoints. Each license file
provides a number of pieces of information, including the license
granting and cancellation dates, a transmitter endpoint and mul-
tiple receiver endpoint coordinates, along with the frequencies at
which the links will operate. The FCC’s Universal Licensing System
(ULS) [25] has various license search interfaces, some of which are:
• Geographic [22], which allows searches for licenses within a
specific radius of a location.
• Site-based [24], which allows searches for licenses based on
radio service codes and station classes.
• License search based on the name of the licensee [21].
• License details [23] based on license ID.
2.2 Data scraping
Using a combination of the different types of license search tools
available, we first broadly identify candidate licensees, and then
examine the set of licenses for each licensee to determine if they
form an end-end network of our interest.
High-volume trading activities take place between the CME,
in Aurora IL, near Chicago [12] in the West, and NASDAQ [36],
NYSE [39], and Equinix NY4 [38] in New Jersey, roughly 1100 km
to the East. We use the Geographic license search to find all licenses
within a radius of 10 km from the CME data center. Next, we use
the Site-based search interface to select only those licenses that
have a radio Service Code ‘MG’ (Microwave Industrial/Business
Pool) and an assigned station class ‘FXO’ (Operational Fixed). This
set of licenses contains every licensee that could potentially operate
an HFT conventional microwave network that reaches CME; this
search uncovers 57 candidate licensees.
Next, we filter out those that have less than 11 license filings
— the geodesic distances between CME and the New Jersey data
centers exceed 1,100 km, implying that 10 or fewer towers (filings)
would require more than 100 km long tower-to-tower microwave
links, which are too inefficient [41]. Finally, we are left with 29
licensees, whose licenses we analyze in further detail.
Our data scraping tool gets the list of all licenses for each com-
pany, and for each license ID collects the following information by
scraping the license details Web page:
• License grant date: Date when a license was formally granted
by the FCC.
• License cancellation date: Date when a license was cancelled by
either the licensor or licensee.
• License termination date: Date when a license is terminated, if
it is not cancelled or extended before that date.
• Tower endpoints: Coordinates and altitude of the towers in-
volved. Typically, each license has a central transmitting end-
point, and one or more receiving endpoints.
• Operating frequencies: A transmitter can use a list of frequencies
to communicate with each receiver.
Uncovering ‘real’ names: For reasons connected to commercial
competition (both historical and current), not all entities file for li-
censes using their actual company names. For example, there is little
information available online concerning three prominent licensees,
Jefferson Microwave, Pierce Broadband, and Webline Holdings. But
the license file details [18, 19] and other online sources [5] hint at
their connections to well-known network providers in the ultra-low
latency space. Such information is not available for all the networks
we study, and in some cases, is difficult to verify, so we only use
the licensee names as found in the FCC portal.
2.3 Network reconstruction
Our tool can reconstruct a network at any arbitrary date in the past
using its licensing information. We assume that if a license is active,
i.e., it was granted but not terminated/cancelled, and forms part
of an end-end path, its MW links are active. This is a reasonable
assumption as tower acquisition and rental tends to be difficult and
expensive [3, 4], and a license is tied to endpoint (tower) coordi-
nates, which means the endpoints have to be fixed before a license

filing. We reconstruct entire networks by stitching together their
individual links: a tower that is an endpoint for two links forms a
node connecting these links.
An end-to-end network needs not only tower-to-tower links, but
also short fiber segments connecting the last tower on each side to
its corresponding data center. We assume that data centers have
fiber connectivity to nearby (up to 50 km away) towers [4], and
that this short fiber segment follows the geodesic, i.e., the shortest
path on Earth’s surface.
We estimate one-way end-to-end latencies between data centers
based on the path lengths divided by the speed of light. The mi-
crowave part of the path is traversed at the speed of light in air,
(almost) c, while the fiber segments are traversed at roughly 2c
3 .
Some networks have multiple paths between the same two data
centers, so we use Dijkstra’s algorithm (accounting for the different
speeds of light in air and fiber) to construct the lowest-latency route
through each network. This approach does not capture the over-
heads from signal repetition or regeneration at towers. We briefly
touch on this in terms of the number of tower hops on paths in §3.
