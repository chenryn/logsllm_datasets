User: How to configure the firewall of Linux system?
Assistant: The following steps can be used to configure the firewall of the Linux system: 1. Install firewall software: Linux system comes with firewall software iptables, which can be installed with the command sudo apt-get install iptables. 2. Set firewall rules: Use iptables command to set firewall rules, for example: - Allow a certain IP address to access a certain port sudo iptables -A INPUT -s [IP address] -p tcp --dport [port] -j ACCEPT - Deny An IP address accesses a certain port sudo iptables -A INPUT -s [IP address] -p tcp --dport [port] -j DROP 3. Save the firewall rules: Use the iptables-save command to save the configured firewall rules to file to prevent the rules from being cleared after the system restarts. sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4 4. Enable the firewall: Use the iptables-restore command to reload the saved firewall rules into the kernel. sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4 After configuring the firewall through the above steps, you can effectively protect the security of the Linux system and prevent unauthorized access and attacks.
