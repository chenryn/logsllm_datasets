User: I am using deferred.defer quite heavily to schedule tasks using push queues on AppEngine. 
Sometimes I wish I would have a clean way to signal a retry for a task without having to raise an Exception that generates a log warning.
Is there a way to do this?
Assistant: Just relaunch the task from the task with another deferred.defer call.
