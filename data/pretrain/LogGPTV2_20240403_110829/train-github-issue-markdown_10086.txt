As reported to matplotlib.users, passing duplicate points to tricontour can
cause it to hang. Here is a minimal example:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.tri as tri
    import numpy as np
    from numpy.random import uniform, seed
    seed(0)
    npts = 7
    x = uniform(-2,2,npts)
    y = uniform(-2,2,npts)
    z = x*np.exp(-x**2-y**2)
    y[1:2] = y[0]  # Duplicate points make tricontour hang!
    x[1:2] = x[0]
    triang = tri.Triangulation(x, y)
    plt.triplot(triang)
    plt.tricontour(triang, z, 15, linewidths=0.5, colors='k')
    plt.show()
