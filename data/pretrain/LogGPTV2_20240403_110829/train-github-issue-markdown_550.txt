### Problem
I'm trying to create a plot which "zooms in" on a subset of a large dataset (I
am plotting the entire dataset because it's much more convenient than clipping
the underlying dataset). I can do this pretty easily for the x-axis with
ax.set_xlim(), because I know what the x-limits of my data should be. However,
I don't know what the y-limits should be, and I can't use ax.set_ymargin()
because it computes the y-margin for the _entire_ dataset, not the zoomed
portion of the dataset. I don't know ahead of time what the min/max values of
my dataset will be, so I'm stuck.
### Proposed Solution
Add an option to ax.set_ymargin specifying a subset of the x-data range over
which to apply the margin. For example:
    ax.set_ymargin(0.1, xlim=(0, 1))
would "zoom in" in y on the portion of the data that exists in the x-range [0,
1], and apply a 10% margin to the data that exists over that range.
