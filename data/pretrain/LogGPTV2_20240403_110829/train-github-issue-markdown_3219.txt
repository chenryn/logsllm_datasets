### Apache Airflow Version
2.4.0

### Issue Description
When attempting to view the logs of a task via the Airflow webserver, I encountered the following error:

```
*** Log file does not exist: /opt/airflow/logs/dag_id=/run_id=manual__2022-09-25T07:01:05.868611+00:00/task_id=get_new_batch_id/attempt=1.log
*** Fetching from: http://.:8793/dag_id=/run_id=manual__2022-09-25T07:01:05.868611+00:00/task_id=get_new_batch_id/attempt=1.log
*** !!!! Please ensure that all your Airflow components (e.g., schedulers, webservers, and workers) have the same 'secret_key' configured in the 'webserver' section and that time is synchronized across all machines (for example, using ntpd) !!!!!
****** See more at https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#secret-key
****** Failed to fetch log file from worker. Client error '403 FORBIDDEN' for URL 'http://.:8793/dag_id=/run_id=manual__2022-09-25T07:01:05.868611+00:00/task_id=get_new_batch_id/attempt=1.log'

```

Upon checking the worker logs, the following error was observed:

```
[2022-09-25T11:05:14.765+0000] {serve_logs.py:104} WARNING - Unknown error
Traceback (most recent call last):
