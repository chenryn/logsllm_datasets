Figure 7: UDmap IP statistics computed with three different metrics on per-IP basis
6.2.1 Volatility Per IP Address
Figure 7(a) shows the cumulative fraction of UDmap IPs that
were used by varying numbers of users. The majority of UDmap
IPs were used by several to tens of users over the 31 day period. Al-
though most of the UDmap IPs had host identity changes, they are
not highly volatile. As expected, proxy IPs appear to be extremely
volatile, with each having a large number of users.
Figure 7(b) shows the histogram of the average inter-user dura-
tions estimated using the procedure described in Section 4.5. We
observe that the time between two consecutive users using a UDmap
IP is in the order of tens of hours to several days. Over 30% of IP
addresses have inter-user durations ranging between 1 and 3 days.
We also notice a small set of IP addresses that were highly dynamic
with inter-user durations below 5 minutes. Manual investigation of
a few such hosts indicates these are likely to be highly dynamic
dialup hosts, and we are investigating this further.
Recall that our input trace also contains information regarding
the operating system used. Based on this information we can ob-
tain a lower-bound on the number of actual OSes (two OSes are
different if they are of different type or version) that have been as-
sociated with each IP. According to the histogram in Figure 7(c),
most of the UDmap IPs have one or two OSes. This characteristics
is strikingly different for proxy IPs, where it is very common for 7
or more different OSes to be associated with an IP address. This
shows that IP volatility can help us remove proxy IPs and hence
reduces false positives of the UDmap algorithm.
6.2.2 Volatility Similarity within Blocks
As dynamic IPs are assigned from a pool of addresses, we pro-
ceed to examine whether the addresses from the same IP block have
similar volatility properties. We introduce a metric, called disper-
sion factor, to quantify the homogeneity of IP volatility across all
the addresses returned in a UDmap IP block. Given a set of values
F = {v1, v2, . . . , vm}, the dispersion factor R is deﬁned as
R =
90th-percentile(F) − median(F)
median(F)
The dispersion factor measures the degree of data dispersion by
computing the normalized difference between the 90th-percentile
value and the median (we use 90th-percentile instead of maximum
to exclude outliers). A large dispersion factor suggests the 90th-
percentile value signiﬁcantly varies from the median and hence a
large variation across the data.
We again consider the two properties reﬂecting IP volatility: the
number of users per IP and the average inter-user duration. Fig-
ure 8(a) shows the distributions of the dispersion factors for these
two properties across all the UDmap IP blocks. Overall, dispersion
factors pertaining to the number of users per IP are smaller than
those of inter-user durations. For the former, 73% of the blocks
have dispersion factors smaller than 1, while for the latter, 33% of
blocks have dispersion factors smaller than 1. This suggests that
the number of users per IP tends to distribute relative evenly in-
side a block, while the user-switch time has a much larger variation
across IPs even within the same address range.
Intuitively, one might expect small blocks to have smaller disper-
sion factors. We classify the UDmap IP blocks into three categories
based on their sizes: small (fewer than 32 IPs), medium (32-256
IPs), and large (more than 256 IPs). Figure 8(b) and (c) show the
breakdown of the dispersion factors for these three categories of
blocks. For both ﬁgures, the X-axis corresponds to the dispersion
factor, and the Y-axis represents the fraction of the blocks. Indeed,
large blocks tend to be more diversiﬁed, particularly for the inter-
user duration metric. Homogeneous blocks with dispersion factors
smaller than 0.1 are almost exclusively small blocks.
Our volatility analysis suggests that IPs within a block are ap-
proximately used by equal number of users. The average inter-user
duration varies within blocks, and small blocks tend to be more
homogeneous in term of IP volatility.
6.2.3
IP Volatility and Network Access Type
In Section 6.2.1, we showed that certain UDmap IP addresses are
more dynamic than others. It is often hypothesized that dial-up IP
addresses are more dynamic, since every dial-up might return a new
address. Similarly, anecdotal evidence suggest cable modem hosts
do not change IP addresses frequently. In this section, we present
a case study to characterize the inter-user durations with respect to
various network access types.
We selected thee known IP blocks that are representative of var-
ious network access types: Bell Canada dial-up (206.172.80.0/24),
SBC DSL (209.30.56.0/22), and Comcast cable (24.10.128.0/16).
UDmap successfully identiﬁed the majority of the addresses in the
trace for Bell Canada and SBC DSL. However when it came to
Comcast cable, UDmap picked 1076 IPs out of the 19512 present
in the input trace, perhaps due to the fact that IP addresses from
Comcast are generally less dynamic [2].
Figure 9 plots the inter-user duration associated with all the IP
addresses that pertain to the three blocks (instead of only those
identiﬁed by UDmap).
If an IP was used by only a single user
during the entire month, we set its inter-user duration to 31 days.
We have the following observations: (1) Bell Canada dial-up block
is much more dynamic than the other two blocks; the majority of
the observed inter-user durations are in the order of hours. (2) SBC
DSL block also displays dynamic behavior, with inter-user duration

Incoming Email Server IP Addresses
Using both Dynablock and UDmap IPs, we classify the remote
email server IPs into two categories: (1) identiﬁed dynamic if it be-
longs to either Dynablock IPs or UDmap IPs, and (2) likely static
otherwise. As we will show later in Section 7.3, most of the legiti-
mate email servers are indeed likely static servers. Figure 10 plots
their IP address distributions in the address space. Despite the dif-
ference in their observed dynamics, the two categories of addresses
come from roughly the same two regions of address space. This
suggests these regions of addresses are used more actively than oth-
ers in general. Therefore, address space location alone, cannot ef-
fectively discriminate a legitimate server from a spam server.
Existing spam ﬁltering techniques use IP address history as a ﬁl-
tering criterium [28]. Recent work [23] showed that most zombie
hosts send spam only once. Since hosts using dynamic IP addresses
are attractive targets for attackers, the volatility of IP addresses that
send email should be a useful metric. Figure 11(a) shows the fre-
quency in terms of the number of days these different categories
of IPs appeared in the log. The majority of the identiﬁed dynamic
IP based email servers have very short histories: 55.1% of them
appeared only once in the three-month period; only 1% of them
appeared more than ten times. As a comparison, 22% of the IPs
classiﬁed as likely static (those not listed by UDmap or in Dyn-
ablock) appeared in the log for more than ten days. For those IPs
that sent emails only once, there was no history to help determine
the likelihood of being a spammer. Even for those reoccurring dy-
namic IP addresses, history is not helpful, exactly because the host
identities might have already changed. In this case, the knowledge
of whether a host is set up with a dynamic IP is helpful in deter-
mining whether spam ﬁlters can leverage its sending history.
7.3 Spam from Dynamic IP Addresses
Although most of the identiﬁed dynamic email servers sent emails
to Hotmail only once during the course of three month, the aggre-
gated volume of spam from these servers is large. Table 6 shows
that about 92% of the emails from UDmap IPs and Dynablock IPs
are spam, accounting for up to 50.7% of the total spam captured
by Hotmail and 49.2% of the user reported spam. We observe that
although Dynablock IP list contains more addresses than UDmap
IPs, there are fewer Dynablock IPs actually used to set up mail
servers. Consequently, the total spam volume from Dynablock IPs
is also lower (15.8 billion as opposed to 24.1 billion from UDmap
IPs). This echoes the importance of an automatic method for keep-
ing track of most up-to-date, popularly used dynamic IPs.
Given the overall high percentage of spam from dynamic IP ad-
dresses, a question we ask is whether spam originates from just a
few hosts. Figure 11(b) shows that a large fraction of mail servers

static; over 70% observed IPs did not change user within the entire
month.
The distinct IP volatility of these three different blocks suggests
it might be possible to classify the type of network access links
based on IP volatility. It is an interesting area of research to fur-
ther understand the correlations between IP volatility and network
access type.

IP DYNAMICS AND SPAM DETECTION
The motivating example in Section 3 illustrates how knowledge
of IP dynamics might help detect spamming email servers from
a speciﬁc university network.
In this section, we systematically
investigate the general applicability of using dynamic IP address
information for spam detection. We use a three-month long email
server log from Hotmail to facilitate our study.
7.1 Data Description
Our Hotmail email server log was collected between June and
early September of 2006 (3 months).
It contains a record of all
incoming SMTP connections aggregated on a daily basis (one en-
try per sending IP per day). Each entry includes a coarse-grained
timestamp, the IP address of the remote email server, and the num-
ber of email messages received. In addition, Hotmail applies content-
based and history-based spam ﬁltering schemes on received email
messages and records the number of spam emails detected by the
ﬁlter. The spam ﬁlter is conﬁgured to detect spam with low false
positive rates, but there still might be spam emails that slip through
the radar. For these false negatives, if a user reports them as spam,
Hotmail logs them in a user feedback database.
