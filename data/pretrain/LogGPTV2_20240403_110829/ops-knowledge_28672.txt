User: is there a good way to gather the mac addresses of machines on a local network using Python.  If it helps I'm trying to execute this python script from the DHCP server for the network. I'm new to Python but would it be a bad idea to look at the DHCP leases file for this info? I'd like to use this inside a Django app eventually. Thanks.
Assistant: The easiest thing to do would be to run a tool that can achieve this and parse its output (e.g. nmap). Depending on your needs, you could run it periodically and keep a file with the mac addresses. 
Looking at the leases file could work, assuming that all your machines are in there. If you want to actively look for machines, do a nmap scan.
