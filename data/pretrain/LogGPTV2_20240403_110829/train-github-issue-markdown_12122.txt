This is a very outdated way to do search. Modern editors will show the first
hit starting from the current caret position as you type the search. It feels
very odd to type something in the search box, wait for it to do something and
have nothing happen. I keep thinking this means it can't find any matches in
the document, but just to be safe I hit Cmd-G and lo and behold it finds a
bunch of matches.
The explicit "go" command is unnecessary when searching a document. Please
implement a modern incremental search.
