#### Simplified Basics of the US Government's Role
- **Strong Tension, Often Bureaucratic Fighting Between Two Groups**
  - **Three main users of vulnerabilities:**
    - **DoD:** warfare and espionage
    - **Intelligence Community (especially NSA and CIA):** espionage and covert action
    - **Law enforcement (Justice, FBI, DHS):** various operations
  - **Several whose “equities” want them closed:**
    - **Commerce:** running a vulnerability disclosure dialog
    - **Treasury, Energy, et al:**
    - **DHS (Critical Infrastructure Protection and cyber):**

#### Three Kinds of Online Target Sets in Military Terms
- **Each with different vulnerability issues:**
  1. **Closed battlefield**
  2. **Closed and proprietary, more commercial or industrial**
  3. **Open Internet, consumer-focused**

#### Prehistory of USG Use of 0-Days
- **USG used (and shared) vulnerabilities at least since the 1990s**
- **US Air Force informal policy to retain vulnerabilities for offensive use**
  - **Bejtlich:** "We actually had a standing order after that that said, if you find something, you don't tell the vendor, you tell the offensive side, and they'll decide what to do about it." [FN1]
- **Hoarded within military services, intelligence agencies**
- **Mid-1990s: NSA “Information Operations Technology Center”**
  - **Develop a common ‘toolbox’ of ‘capabilities’ based in part on vulnerabilities**

#### White House Involvement
- **July 2002: NSPD-16 “To Develop Guidelines for Offensive Cyber-Warfare”**
  - **Asserted presidential authority to coordinate capabilities and operations**
  - **Classified but doesn’t seem to specifically include policy on vulnerabilities**
- **Prior to 2010, no formal US government-wide policy or process for handling vulnerabilities**

#### Pre-2010 USG 0-Day Policy
- **NSA develops strong internal process based on 'intel gain/loss' and 'equities' decisions**
  - **Will US national interest be more served by sharing with vendors or keeping for our own use?**
  - **More likely to keep if NOBUS – so obscure or complex it is “not usable by anyone but us”**
- **Decision entirely up to DIRNSA**
- **Assume CIA, Justice had similar internal processes**

#### US Government Vulnerability Equities Process (VEP)
- **Formal new process in 2010 - we now know thanks to EFF [FN2]**
  - **Included 'interagency' review by other interested parties, including defensive agencies**
  - **ODNI VEP document sets out:**
    - **Process for notification, decision-making, and appeals**
    - **Established NSA as the Executive Secretariat**

#### VEP Process (2010 to 2014)
- **Policy from 2010 not fully implemented**
  - **“VEP was dormant. NSA continued to run their own internal process but did not formally include outside agencies.” [FN3]**
  - **White House: Previous “default disclosure policy … not implemented to full degree” so needed to be “reinvigorated” [FN4]**
    - **Possibly driven by news of Stuxnet’s five 0-days…**

#### Recent Federal 0-Day Process
- **Post-Snowden review group recommends Obama strengthen process [FN5]**
- **Obama accepts recommendations deciding:**
  - **Policy is to disclose by default**
  - **Centralize decision power in the White House rather than at NSA**
- **New policy enacted in January 2014 [FN6]**

#### Congressional Testimony by Admiral Rogers (March 2014) [FN7]
- **“The default is to disclose vulnerabilities in products and systems used by the U.S. and its allies”**
- **“NSA has always employed this principle in the adjudication of vulnerability findings”**
- **“Within NSA, there is a mature and efficient equities resolution process for handling ‘0-day’ vulnerabilities discovered in any commercial product or system (not just software) utilized by the U.S. and its allies”**
- **“Technical experts document the vulnerability in full classified detail, options to mitigate the vulnerability, and a proposal for how to disclose it”**
- **“When NSA decides to withhold a vulnerability for purposes of foreign intelligence … [we] will attempt to find other ways to mitigate the risks to national security systems and other US systems”**

#### Recent Federal 0-Day Process
- **Repeat: White House policy is to disclose to vendors, not to keep for intel or warfighting**
  - **Policy decision by the President himself and enforced by the National Security Council staff**
  - **About as strong as you can get in the Beltway**
- **But … Obama’s decision carved out exceptions for national security or law enforcement**
  - **Three breakthroughs loomed, giving far more info**

#### Breakthrough #1: Heartbleed Forces White House’s Hand
- **April 2014 Bloomberg story falsely trumpets that NSA knew about Heartbleed and kept for offense [FN8]**
- **Follow-up NYT story gets NSA to publicly deny they knew [FN9, FN10]**
- **17 days after first, Bloomberg story…**
  - **Extensive blog by NSC cyber coordinator Michael Daniel [FN11] outlines White House decision criteria on when to retain/disclose vulnerabilities:**
    1. **How much is the vulnerable system used in the core internet infrastructure, in other critical infrastructure systems, in the U.S. economy, and/or in national security systems?**
    2. **Does the vulnerability, if left unpatched, impose significant risk?**
    3. **How much harm could an adversary nation or criminal group do with knowledge of this vulnerability?**
    4. **How likely is it that we would know if someone else was exploiting it?**
    5. **How badly do we need the intelligence we think we can get from exploiting the vulnerability? Are there other ways we can get it?**
    6. **Could we utilize the vulnerability for a short period of time before we disclose it?**
    7. **How likely is it that someone else will discover the vulnerability?**
    8. **Can the vulnerability be patched or otherwise mitigated?**

#### Breakthrough #2: EFF FOIA of Core VEP Documents
- **In January 2016, EFF released documents pursuant to FOIA request and lawsuit [FN2]**

#### Breakthrough #3: NSA Infographic (October 30, 2015) [FN12]
- **Only NSA, not all USG**
- **Use of word “historically” implying this includes all NSA vulnerabilities back at least to 2020**
- **9% not disclosed includes those already fixed by vendors**

#### VEP Process (2014 - Present)
- **“91% disclosed”**

#### What We Learned from Breakthroughs
- **Applies to all Feds and contractors and all vulnerabilities, whether discovered or bought**
- **“Newly discovered and not publicly known”**
  - **Does not apply to vulnerabilities found prior to the policy**
- **New process not owned by NSA but by White House, which makes final decision**
- **Subtle inside-the-Beltway point:**
  - **Within White House, ERB run by Cyber Directorate, not intel or defense directorates**

#### What We Don’t Know from Breakthroughs
- **Making sense of Apple-FBI**
- **How many vulnerabilities does the USG keep each year?**
  - **Hundreds, thousands, millions?**
- **Can we independently verify the USG claims?**
- **How large is the existing USG 0-day arsenal?**
  - **Hundreds, thousands, millions?**
- **Other nations’ programs**

#### FBI v. Apple (1)
- **FBI should have had to submit iPhone 5 vulnerability to VEP**
- **Based on Daniel criteria, almost certainly would have had to disclose to Apple [FN13]**
- **FBI claiming contractual IP restrictions:**
  - **Don’t actually know what vulnerability and only bought the use of the tool [FN14]**
  - **So cannot possibly submit to VEP as don’t know the vulnerability**

#### FBI v. Apple (2)
- **Seems to contradict pretty clear Presidential guidance, not sure yet if it is intentional**
- **Implications: yet to see if NSC will re-vamp the VEP guidance to specifically provide policy to close this loophole**
- **Side note: FBI informed Apple of a vulnerability for the first time under the VEP in April 2016 [FN15]**

#### How Many Vulnerabilities Did the USG Retain Prior to the “Reinvigorated Policy”?
- **Not hundreds or thousands per year but probably dozens**
  - **Moderate confidence in this assessment**
  - **NSA had a 2013 budget of $25.1 million for “additional covert purchases of software vulnerabilities” [FN16]**
  - **Does not count any bought by other agencies or discovered internally within NSA**
  - **What can this tell us?**
  - **Assumptions:**
    - **No bucket of bugs**
    - **Some purchase of non-commercial vulnerabilities**
    - **Tend towards higher value vulnerabilities**
    - **“91%” is roughly accurate (more on this later)**

#### Can We Believe 91%?
- **Dickie George, former IAD:**
  - **Retaining was “very rare” [FN17]**
- **Former DIRNSA Hayden:**
  - **“Consistent with my experience … NEVER taken lightly. Might have previously, trended toward offense … but always taken seriously and fulcrum [towards defense] shifted over time” [FN18]**
- **Only applies to NSA, not all of the government**
- **Need evidence from vendors, but out of scope**
- **Assume accurate-ish for now**

#### Example Calculation
- **Example 1: Purchases**
  - **250 x important commercial vulnerabilities @ $100k each**
  - **250 total commercial vulnerabilities of which 91% disclosed**
  - **~25 total vulnerabilities purchased per year are retained**
  - **Assume similar number purchased from other agencies and similar number discovered**
