Today’s Talk
1. How does US government decide to retain or 
disclose 0days vulnerabilities?
2. How many 0days does the US government 
keep to itself every year?
– Hundreds? Thousands? More? Less?
3. How big is the full US arsenal of 0days?
– Hundreds? Thousands? More? Less?
4. What we don’t know & recommendations

Way Overly Simplified Basics of USG Role
Strong Tension, Often Bureaucratic Fighting Between Two Groups
• Three main users of vulns
– DoD: warfare and espionage
– Intelligence Community (esp NSA and CIA): 
espionage and covert action
– Law enforcement: Justice, FBI, DHS
• Several whose “equities” want them closed
– Commerce - running a vuln disclosure dialog
– Treasury, Energy, et al
– DHS (CIP and cyber)
Three Kinds of Online Targets Sets 
in Military Terms
Each With Different Vuln Issues
1. Closed battlefield
2. Closed and proprietary, more 
commercial or industrial
3. Open Internet, consumer focused
Prehistory of USG Use of 0days
• USG used (and shared) vulns at least since 1990s
• US Air Force informal policy to retain vulns for offense use
– Bejtlich: "We actually had a standing order after that that said, if 
you find something, you don't tell the vendor, you tell the 
offensive side, and they'll decide what to do about it.“ [FN1]
• Hoarded within military services, intelligence agencies
• Mid-1990s: NSA “Information Operations Technology 
Center” 
– Develop a common ‘toolbox’ of ‘capabilities’ based in part on 
vulnerabilities
Prehistory of USG Use of 0days
• White House gets involved with NSPD-16 in July 2002: “To 
Develop Guidelines for Offensive Cyber-Warfare”
– Asserted presidential authority to coordinate 
capabilities and operations 
– Classified but doesn’t seem to specifically include 
policy on vulns
Prior to 2010, no formal US government-wide 
policy or process for handling vulns
Pre-2010 USG 0-Day Policy
• NSA develops strong internal process based on 'intel gain/loss' 
and 'equities' decisions
– Will US national interest be more served by sharing with vendors or 
keeping for our own use?
– More likely to keep if NOBUS – so obscure or complex it is “not usable 
by anyone but us”
• Decision entirely up to DIRNSA 
• Assume CIA, Justice had similar internal process
US Government 
Vulnerability Equities Process
• Formal new process in 2010 - we now know 
thanks to EFF [FN2] 
– Included 'interagency' review by other interested 
parties, including the defensive agencies 
– ODNI VEP document sets out 
• Process for notification, decision-making, and appeals 
• Established NSA as the Executive Secretariat
VEP Process 
2010 to 2014
Policy from 2010 Not Fully Implemented
• “VEP was dormant. NSA continued to run their own 
internal process but did not formally include outside 
agencies.” [FN3]
• White House: Previous “default disclosure policy … 
not implemented to full degree” so needed to be 
“reinvigorated” [FN4]
– Possibly driven by news of Stuxnet’s five 0days…
More Recent Fed 0day Process
• Post-Snowden review group recommends 
Obama strengthen process [FN5]
• Obama accepts recommendations deciding 
– Policy is to disclose by default
– Centralize decision power in the White House 
rather than at NSA
• New policy enacted in January 2014 [FN6]
Congressional Testimony by Admiral Rogers 
March of 2014 [FN7]
•
“The default is to disclose vulnerabilities in products and systems 
used by the U.S. and its allies
•
“NSA has always employed this principle in the adjudication of 
vulnerability findings
•
“Within NSA, there is a mature and efficient equities resolution 
process for handling ‘0-day’ vulnerabilities discovered in any 
commercial product or system (not just software) utilized by the 
U.S. and its allies
•
“Technical experts document the vulnerability in full classified 
detail, options to mitigate the vulnerability, and a proposal for how 
to disclose it.
•
“When NSA decides to withhold a vulnerability for purposes of 
foreign intelligence … [we] will attempt to find other ways to 
mitigate the risks to national security systems and other US 
systems”
More Recent Fed 0day Process
• Repeat: White House policy is to disclose to 
vendors, not to keep for intel or warfighting
– Policy decision by the President himself and 
enforced by the National Security Council staff
– About as strong as you can get in the Beltway
• But … Obama’s decision carved out exceptions 
for national security or law enforcement
– Three breakthroughs loomed, giving far more info
Breakthrough #1:
Heartbleed Forces White House’s Hand
• April 2014 Bloomberg 
story falsely trumpets that 
NSA knew about 
Heartbleed and kept for 
offense [FN8]
• Follow-up NYT story gets 
NSA to publicly deny they 
knew [FN9, FN10]
Heartbleed Forces White House’s Hand
•
17 days after first, Bloomberg story…
•
Extensive blog by NSC cyber coordinator Michael Daniel [FN11] outlines 
White House decision criteria on when to retain/disclose vulns:
1.
How much is the vulnerable system used in the core internet infrastructure, 
in other critical infrastructure systems, in the U.S. economy, and/or in 
national security systems?
2.
Does the vulnerability, if left unpatched, impose significant risk?
3.
How much harm could an adversary nation or criminal group do with 
knowledge of this vulnerability?
4.
How likely is it that we would know if someone else was exploiting it?
5.
How badly do we need the intelligence we think we can get from exploiting 
the vulnerability? Are there other ways we can get it?
6.
Could we utilize the vulnerability for a short period of time before we 
disclose it?
7.
How likely is it that someone else will discover the vulnerability?
8.
Can the vulnerability be patched or otherwise mitigated?
Breakthrough #2
EFF FOIA of Core VEP Documents
• In January 2016, 
EFF released 
documents 
pursuant to FOIA  
request and 
lawsuit [FN2] 
Breakthrough #3
NSA Infographic, 30 October 2015 [FN12]
•
Only NSA, not all USG
•
Use of word “historically” implying this includes all NSA 
vulns back at least to 2020
•
9% not disclosed includes those already fixed by vendors
VEP Process 
2014 - present
>“91% disclosed”
What We Learned from Breakthroughs
• Applies to all Feds and contractors and all vulns
whether discovered or bought
• “Newly discovered and not publicly known”
– Does not apply to vulns found prior to the policy
• New process not owned by NSA but by White House, 
which makes final decision
• Subtle inside-the-Beltway point: 
– Within White House, ERB run by Cyber Directorate, not 
intel or defense directorates
What Don’t We Know from Breakthroughs
• Making sense of Apple-FBI 
• How many vulns does USG keep each year?
– Hundreds, thousands, millions?
• Can we independently verify the USG claims?
• How large is existing USG 0day arsenal?
– Hundreds, thousands, millions?
• Other nations’ programs
FBI v Apple (1)
• FBI should have had to submit iPhone 5 vuln
to VEP 
• Based on Daniel criteria, almost certainly 
would have had to disclose to Apple [FN13]
• FBI claiming contractual IP restrictions
– Don’t actually know what vulnerability and only 
bought the use of the tool [FN14]
– So cannot possibly submit to VEP as don’t know 
the vuln
FBI v Apple (2)
• Seems to contradict pretty clear Presidential 
guidance, not sure yet if it is intentional
• Implications: yet to see if NSC will re-vamp the 
VEP guidance to specifically provide policy to 
close this loophole
• Side note: FBI informed Apple of a vuln for the 
first time under the VEP in April 2016 [FN15]
How Many Vulns Did USG Retain?
Prior to “Reinvigorated Policy”
How Many Vulns Did USG Retain?
Prior to “Reinvigorated Policy”
• Not hundreds or thousands per year but probably dozens
– Moderate confidence in this assessment
How Many Vulns Did USG Retain?
Prior to “Reinvigorated Policy”
• Not hundreds or thousands per year but probably dozens
– Moderate confidence in this assessment
– NSA had 2013 budget of $25.1 million for “additional covert 
purchases of software vulnerabilities” [FN16]
– Does not count any bought by other agencies or discovered 
internal to NSA
– What can this tell us?
– Assumptions: 
• No bucket of bugs
• Some purchase of non-commercial vulns
• Tend towards higher value vulns
• “91%” is roughly accurate (more on this later)
Can We Believe 91%?
• Dickie George, former IAD: 
– Retaining was “very rare” [FN17]
• Former DIRNSA Hayden: 
– “consistent with my experience … NEVER taken 
lightly. Might have previously, trended toward offense … 
but always taken seriously and fulcrum [towards defense] 
shifted over time” [FN18]
• Only applies to NSA not all of government
• Need evidence from vendors, but out of scope
• Assume accurate-ish for now
How Many Vulns Did USG Retain?
Prior to “Reinvigorated Policy”
• Example 1:
– Purchases
• 250 x important commercial  
vulns @ $100k each
• 250 total commercial vulns of 
which 91% disclosed
– ~25 total of vulns purchased 
per year are retained
• Assume similar number 
purchased from other 
agencies and similar number 
discovered
