User:  want to create an EC2 instance on AWS, what should I pay attention to?
Assistant: 1. Select the appropriate instance type: AWS provides various types of EC2 instances, and different types of instances are suitable for different scenarios, such as requiring high CPU, high memory, and high network bandwidth. Choosing the right instance type can improve the performance and reliability of your application. 2. Choose the right operating system: AWS supports multiple operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, etc. Selecting an appropriate operating system can meet the requirements of the application program on the operating system, such as the need to use specific software and specific versions. 3. Choose the right storage option: AWS provides a variety of storage options, such as EBS, S3, etc. Choosing the right storage option can improve application reliability and performance. 4. Configure a security group: A security group is a control mechanism for instance network access in AWS, which can be configured to control the inbound and outbound network traffic of an instance. Configuring a security group can ensure the security of EC2 instances. 5. Set the administrator access rights of the instance: By default in AWS, only the creator has the administrator access rights. You need to set the administrator access rights when creating the instance to facilitate the management of the instance later. 6. Select the appropriate geographical location of the instance: AWS provides instances in multiple geographical locations, and selecting the appropriate geographical location of the instance can improve the performance of the application. 7. Rational use of tags: Using tags can mark and classify EC2 instances, which can manage and identify instances more clearly.
