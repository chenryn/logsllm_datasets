User: I installed both Python 2.7 and Python 2.6.5. I don't know what went wrong, but nothing related to Python seems to work any more. e.g. "setup.py install" for certain packages don't recognize the "install" parameter and other odd phenomena...
I would like to completely remove Python from my system.
I tried running the 2.7 and 2.6 msi files and choosing remove Python and then running only 2.6 and reinstalling it. Still stuff don't work.
How do I completely remove Python - from everything? (!)
I would not like to reinstall my entire machine just because of the Python install...
Assistant: you can delete it manually.

open Command Prompt
cd C:\Users\<you name>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
del python.exe
del python3.exe

Now the command prompt won't be showing it anymore
where python --> yields nothing, and you are free to install another version from source / anaconda and (after adding its address to Environment Variables -> Path) you will find that very python you just installed
