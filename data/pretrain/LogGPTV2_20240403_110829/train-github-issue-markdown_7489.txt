In the ES 5 alphas we have some awesome bootstrap checks. However when you
start ES as a service, eg `service elasticsearch start` and haven't completed
those, it gives;
     * Starting Elasticsearch Server                                                                                                                                                                                                       [ OK ]
And in the logs it complains because not all of the checks passed.
We shouldn't really be returning an `OK` from the service if it doesn't start
at all.
