Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the KQL (Kusto Query Language) query for detecting Gootkit file delivery, with added comments for clarity:

```kql
// Main alert filter: Identify alerts related to suspected Gootkit malware delivery
AlertInfo
| where Title =~ "Suspected delivery of Gootkit malware"

// Uncomment the following lines if you want to see only file creation events 
// where the malware may be present but has not yet been executed.
// | project AlertId, DeviceId, Title, Timestamp, AccountName

// Join with AlertEvidence to get additional context from the alert
| join kind=inner AlertEvidence on $left.AlertId == $right.AlertId

// Join with DeviceNetworkEvents to identify potential Command and Control (C2) activity
| join kind=inner DeviceNetworkEvents on $left.DeviceId == $right.DeviceId

// Filter for specific indicators of C2 activity
| where InitiatingProcessFileName =~ "wscript.exe" 
  and InitiatingProcessCommandLine has ".zip"
  and InitiatingProcessCommandLine has ".js"

// Summarize the results to provide a clear overview
| summarize by 
    RemoteUrl, 
    RemoteIP, 
    DeviceId, 
    InitiatingProcessCommandLine, 
    Timestamp, 
    InitiatingProcessFileName, 
    AlertId, 
    Title, 
    AccountName
```

### Explanation:
1. **Main Alert Filter**: The query starts by filtering `AlertInfo` to find alerts with the title "Suspected delivery of Gootkit malware."
2. **Optional File Creation Events**: If you want to see only file creation events where the malware may be present but has not yet been executed, you can uncomment the `project` line.
3. **Join with Alert Evidence**: The `join` with `AlertEvidence` provides additional context from the alert.
4. **Join with Network Events**: The `join` with `DeviceNetworkEvents` helps in identifying potential Command and Control (C2) activity.
5. **Filter for C2 Indicators**: The `where` clause filters for specific indicators of C2 activity, such as `wscript.exe` initiating processes with `.zip` and `.js` in the command line.
6. **Summarize Results**: The `summarize` statement provides a clear overview of the relevant fields.

This query should help you effectively detect and analyze Gootkit file delivery and associated C2 activity.
