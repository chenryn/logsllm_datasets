User: What are some common optimizations to improve network performance?
Assistant: 1. CDN Acceleration: Using CDN (Content Distribution Network) of global nodes can improve the access speed of websites or applications, and reduce the delay and response time of user access. 2. Compression technology: Use Gzip and other compression technologies to reduce the size of pages or data packets, reduce the amount of transmitted data, and improve transmission efficiency and speed. 3. Load balancing: By balancing the load on the server, users and traffic can be distributed, making the server run more smoothly and improving performance and reliability. 4. Optimize images: Optimizing images can reduce file size, speed up the loading of images, and reduce the loading time of websites or applications. 5. Reduce HTTP requests: Reducing HTTP requests can shorten page loading time and improve access speed. 6. Merge files and scripts: Merge CSS, JavaScript and other files and scripts to reduce HTTP requests and improve page loading speed. 7. Browser cache: Using browser cache can reduce server response time and improve user access speed. 8. Remove unnecessary resources: Removing unnecessary HTML, CSS, JavaScript and image resources can speed up page loading and improve access performance. 9. Database optimization: Optimizing the query and read/write speed of the database can improve the performance and response speed of the application. 10. Use high-performance servers: Use high-efficiency Web servers, database servers, and application servers to improve processing speed and performance.
