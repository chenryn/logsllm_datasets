Ethereum  
     About 2013, the public realized that Blockchain can be used in hundreds 
of applications besides cryptocurrency, such as asset issuance, 
crowdfunding, domain-name registration, ownership registration, market 
forecasting, Internet of things, voting and so on. 
How to realize?  
Smart contracts are pieces of code that live on the Blockchain 
and  execute commands exactly how the were told to. 
“smart contract" - a computer program running in a secure environment 
that automatically transfers digital assets according to previously arbitrary 
rules.

Smart Contract 
How to build one? 
■  Blockchain with built-in programming language 
■  maximum abstraction and versatility 
■  it is very ideal to process smart contracts 
Ethereum 
Ethereum 
EVM: It is the operating environment for smart contract in 
the Ethereum. It is not only encapsulated by a sandbox, but 
in fact it is completely isolated, that is, the code that runs 
inside the EVM does not have access to the network, file 
system, or other processes. Even smart contracts have 
limited contact with other smart contracts. 
 Operating System  
Contract usage scenario 
Hedging contracts, Savings Purse, 
Testamentary contract 
Financial scenario 
Online voting, De-centralized 
governance , Domain name 
registration 
Non-financial scenario

The Ecology of the Ethereum 
On average, there are 100 thousand of new users join the 
Ethereum ecosystem every day. The users are very 
active, with an average daily transactions of more than 1 
million times on Ethereum.

Vulnerability in Smart Contracts  
According to , In 
March 2018, nearly 1 million smart contracts were analyzed , among which there are 
34200 smart contracts can be easily attacked by hackers.  
How to lower the probability of loss ? 
A complete and objective audit is required for smart contracts. 
The emergency response can be made when the vulnerability was found in Smart 
Contracts  
Reward can be provided when someone detect any bug .
