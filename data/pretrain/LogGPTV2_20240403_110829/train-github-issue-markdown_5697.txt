 **I'm submitting a feature request**
**Webpack version:**  
2 (and maybe 1 if feasible)
It would be a nice feature for there to be an official API which would enable
support for web workers and could be used in a plugin such as webworkify-
webpack.
At the moment it looks like webworkify-webpack has to rely on webpack
internals which may change in the future.
There is an official webpack loader for web workers but this will result in
duplicate code as the webworker code is compiled separately. The webworkify-
webpack plugin is nicer because it passes the module code that the webworker
entry point needs at runtime, as well as the webpack internals so that the
worker can require the modules it needs. This means if the worker code uses
moduleA, moduleB and moduleC, and the main application javascript also uses
these modules they will only be in the build once. With the official plugin
they will be in the build twice (afaik).
