### Feature Request for Webpack

**Webpack Version:**
- 2 (and potentially 1, if feasible)

**Feature Description:**

It would be beneficial to introduce an official API in Webpack that provides support for web workers. This API could be utilized by plugins such as `webworkify-webpack`.

**Current Situation:**

Currently, `webworkify-webpack` relies on internal Webpack mechanisms, which may change in future versions. While there is an official Webpack loader for web workers, it can result in duplicated code because the web worker code is compiled separately.

**Advantages of `webworkify-webpack`:**

The `webworkify-webpack` plugin is more efficient because it dynamically passes the module code required by the web worker at runtime, along with the necessary Webpack internals. This ensures that if the web worker and the main application both use the same modules (e.g., `moduleA`, `moduleB`, and `moduleC`), these modules will only be included once in the final build. In contrast, the official Webpack loader for web workers would include these modules twice, leading to unnecessary duplication.

**Proposed Solution:**

Implementing an official API for web workers in Webpack would provide a more stable and efficient solution. This API should:

1. Allow plugins like `webworkify-webpack` to integrate seamlessly without relying on internal Webpack details.
2. Ensure that shared modules are included only once in the final build, avoiding duplication.
3. Provide a consistent and reliable way to manage web workers within the Webpack ecosystem.

Thank you for considering this feature request.
