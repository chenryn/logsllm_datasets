ABSTRACT
In this paper we propose a new biometric measure to authenticate
the user of a smartphone: the movement the user performs when
answering (or placing) a phone call. The biometric measure lever-
ages features that are becoming commodities in new smartphones,
i.e. accelerometer and orientation sensors. We argue that this new
biometric measure has a unique feature. That is, it allows a trans-
parent authentication (not requiring an additional speciﬁc interac-
tion for this) to check that the user that is answering (or placing)
a phone call is the one authorized to do that. At the same time,
this biometric measure can also be used as a non transparent au-
thentication method, e.g. the user may need to move the phone as
if answering a call, in order to unlock the phone to get access to
SMSs or emails. As a consequence of being a biometric measure,
an adversary that spies on the movement (e.g. captures it with a
camera) and tries to replicate it, will not be granted access to the
phone.
We prototyped our solution and conducted several experiments
to assess its feasibility. Results show that the method is effective,
and the performance is comparable to that of other transparent au-
thentication methods, like face or voice recognition.

communications. Hence, many authentication methods have been
provided to restrict access to unauthorized users. Non transparent
methods (e.g. PIN) are the most commonly used, while requir-
ing an aware interaction with the user—for this reason, some users
tend to avoid this type of authentication. Furthermore, even when
in place, these methods often do not block a malicious user to get
some access to the phone, e.g. answering to an incoming call. On
the other hand, current transparent methods (e.g. keystroke analy-
sis) take a signiﬁcant amount of time to authenticate the user, and
they cannot guarantee that an unauthorized user is blocked before
she gets access to the desired data or service. In general, most of
the current systems leave the possibility to answer a phone call even
if the phone is locked (e.g. with a PIN).
Previous works have already investigated the possibility to use
the accelerometer as biometric authentication. However, they either
only considered secret movements the user needs to remember [15]
(i.e. non transparent authentication), or they require the user to do
some gesture that is not naturally connected to the phone usage
(e.g. walking [16]).
In this paper, we propose a new authentication method that aims
to solve the problems mentioned before. The proposed method of-
fers transparency by identifying if the user that is answering (or
placing) a call is the authorized one. In particular, we investigate
if a user can be authenticated just by using the movement she per-
forms, from the moment she presses “start” (to initiate a call), until
she takes the phone to the ear. We will refer to this movement as
a pattern. We treat this movement as a biometric feature, and we
demonstrate that there are sufﬁcient differences between different
users, such that the movement can effectively be used for identiﬁ-
cation. In this way, as soon as a call is answered (or placed), the
phone can promptly evaluate if the user is authorized to perform
this action, and block the system in case of non authorized users.
Moreover, the mechanism might be used even in case of phones
shared among multiple users. Each user could have its own proﬁle
and authentication would be performed by comparing new move-
ments to the existing proﬁles. If it is determined that the user ac-
cessing the device can be matched to one of the existing proﬁles,
then access is granted, otherwise it is denied. Another possible use
of our system is to perform forensics analysis, e.g. to investigate
who used the phone at a particular point in time.
Finally, we note that the proposed mechanism might be even
used just in substitution of current (non secret) unlocking mecha-
nisms, without user identiﬁcation purposes: these mechanisms are
the ones currently in place to avoid accidentally answering (or plac-
ing) a call while the phone is, for example, within the user’s bag.
Checking for an answering movement pattern after the “start” but-
ton is pressed (that can be accidental), the phone avoids that un-
wanted calls are placed or answered.
Contribution. The main contribution of this work is to assess
whether the call answering movement is a unique biometric feature—
no previous work has investigated on this issue. We consider the
movement performed from the instant an user presses “start”, to
initiate a mobile conversation, until she places the phone to the ear.
Moreover, we propose to use also the orientation sensor for bio-
metric measurements. To our knowledge, so far researchers used
only the accelerometer sensor when dealing with movement pat-
terns recognitions. We observe that both orientation sensor and ac-
celerometer sensor are common in smartphones today on the mar-
ket (e.g. the Google Dev phones).
We propose four basic authentication methods, each one being
a speciﬁc combination of considered sensor and recognition algo-
rithm. Each of these methods needs a training phase. After this,
the method compares a newly observed pattern with the reference
ones. Depending on the similarity measure and the threshold set,
the method outputs a binary result: 0 (rejected user), 1 (accepted
user). We also propose a way of combining these basic methods to
improve their performances. In particular, we leverage the fact that,
combining methods, the similarity measures can give us more in-
formation than the binary one gives as output. We implemented our
proposals for the Android system, and tested it with the HTC Dev
1 smartphone considering ten different users. The results are very
promising and show that: (i) the proposed method is effective; (ii)
the performances are comparable to the ones of other transparent
authentication methods, like face or voice recognition—in terms of
both False Alarm Rate (FAR) and Impostor Pass Rate (IPR); (iii)
the proposed way of combining methods is further able to improve
the (already good) performances of the basic methods.
Roadmap. In Section 2 we present the main authentication meth-
ods that have been proposed over the years, and we discuss why
there is a need for improvements. In Section 3 we present the main
technologies used by our solution, the recognition algorithms ap-
plied, and the other preliminaries for this paper. Section 4 presents
the solution we are proposing. Section 5 reports on the experiments
that were conducted and discuss the results obtained. Finally, Sec-
tion 6 concludes this paper and discuss further possible improve-
ments.
2. RELATED WORK
Smartphones nowadays are very popular. They offer support for
an increasing number of applications like web browsers, e-mail
clients, applications for editing documents, taking pictures, and so
on. This increase of capabilities and usage creates also the need
to improve the security of these devices. However, authentication
methods already available for smartphones do not offer sufﬁcient
transparency and security.
Classical (non transparent, non biometric) authentication solu-
tions, like PIN based methods or graphical passwords, have been
proposed long time back. However, being non transparent, these
methods ask for the aware participation from the user. This leads
often to annoy the user, e.g. continuously prompting her with some
challenges. As a result, many users tend to completely remove
such authentication methods. Moreover, classical methods based
on PINs or passwords are easy to break. This is the case because
people choose predictable passwords that have a meaning (e.g. im-
portant dates or pet names), making them easy to remember but also
easy to break [19]. Similarly, graphical passwords use secret draw-
ings [12], instead of secret strings of characters. Even in this case,
users tend to choose symmetric ﬁgures making the password space
small, and again easy to break. Finally, we have to mention pos-
250
sible attacks where the adversary steals the secret by spying (e.g.
with a camera) the user while she inputs the secret (password or
drawing). For example, a recent work [7] has shown the feasibility
of the “smudge attack” to the Android password pattern. That is,
using a camera that takes pictures of the screen of the smartphone, it
is possible to reconstruct the pattern drawn by the user on the touch
screen, to unlock the phone. This is done by leveraging the light re-
ﬂex of the smudge left on the smartphone. Interestingly, this seems
to be feasible even taking pictures long time after the user drawn
her unlocking pattern, or the screen has been (apparently) clean.
Some of the mentioned problems of classical authentication meth-
ods can be solved by biometric authentication methods.
In fact,
these methods increase the security since their secrets can not be
easily spied and reproduced—since they identify the user based on
her natural features. Biometric measures are classiﬁed into two
main categories: physiological biometrics and behavioral biomet-
rics [20].
Physiological biometrics identify the user based on her physi-
ological features. They include: face recognition [4], ﬁngerprint
recognition [20], external ear shape recognition [18], internal acous-
tic ear shape recognition [6] (i.e. measuring the shape of the ear
channel using acoustic data). However, we found the current phys-
iological biometric solutions to be affected by one or more of the
following problems: (i) non transparent usage; (ii) performances
are heavily inﬂuenced by external factors such as illumination, po-
sition or occlusion [20] ; (iii) lack of required hardware on current
smartphones.
For example, a good recognition rate could be obtained when us-
ing external ear shape recognition [18, 9] (recognition rate of some
90%) or internal acoustic ear recognition [6] (Equal Error Rate,
EER, of some 5.5%). However, this methods are heavily inﬂu-
enced by external factors. For example, it is hard to transparently
get a useful picture of the ear, or get a useful acoustic feedback
that characterizes the internal shape [6], when the ear might be ob-
structed by hair, or because user is wearing things like hats or veils.
Similarly, the camera should be at a distance appropriate to get the
correct focus on the target. In fact, we note that in the experiments
described in [9], the cited recognition rates were achieved under
these conditions: (i) a speciﬁc setup for capturing the image; (ii)
an active participation of the user (e.g. uncovering the ears from
the hair). These constraints result in a completely non transparent
authentication of the user.
Within physiological biometric measures, methods that do not
suffer much by obstruction problems are ﬁngerprint recognition
and internal ear recognition. The area that needs to be captured
for ﬁngerprint is small, and usually there is no occlusion that may
intervene between the user’s ﬁnger and the scanner [20] (unless
the user wears gloves). However, this method would suffer by the
other highlighted problems. That is, it is not transparent to the user
and, most importantly, it cannot be leveraged by the technologies
already available in smartphones. Similarly, internal ear recogni-
tion [6] needs extra devices: a special device that is placed in the
ear to emit acoustic signals and a special microphone needs to be
attached to the smartphone.
The other classiﬁcation of biometric measures is the one of be-
havioral biometrics, where user is identiﬁed based on her behav-
ioral features: e.g. keystroke dynamics [10], voice pattern [17],
or gesture (e.g.
the user’s walking pattern [16]). However, for
these currently implemented methods the recognition process takes
a long period of time. For example, in order to recognize the user
from her walking pattern [16], the user would have to walk ﬁrst for
the device to ﬁgure out whether she is the correct user or not. For
keystroke dynamics the user has to type a phrase, e.g. up to over

Similarly, for voice recognition the user would have to output some
