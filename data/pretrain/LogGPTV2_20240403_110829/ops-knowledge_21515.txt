User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the difference between artifact and evidence I am reading about the incident response. I cannot able to understand exactly the terms artifact and evidence. When i searched in google so many resources are using these terms generally. How can i find out standard definitions for these two terms? and what is the difference between them?

Assistant: Artifact: A piece of data that may or may not be relevant to the investigation / response. Examples include registry keys, files, time stamps, and event logs.  You can see many defined in the ForensicArtifacts project on github. 

Evidence: A piece of data (artifact) that is relevant to your investigation because it supports or refutes a hypothesis. 

With our incident response software, we talk about collecting artifacts from remote hosts and analyzing them to determine if they are evidence.
