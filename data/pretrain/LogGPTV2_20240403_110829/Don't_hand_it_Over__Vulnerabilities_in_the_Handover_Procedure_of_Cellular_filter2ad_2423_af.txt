### 7.2 Impact on the Network

The impact of attacks is not limited to the User Equipment (UE); the network itself is significantly affected. When a malicious base station triggers a handover, the UE will attach to the false base station, causing the network to wait for acknowledgment responses. Eventually, the timers will expire, and all the preparation efforts will be in vain, resulting in wasted network resources.

Additionally, the Automatic Neighbor Relation (ANR) and Physical Cell ID (PCI) optimization functions in LTE, as described in [16], are also impacted, as noted in [46]. In a handover attack, the legitimate base station is forced to search for and establish X2/Xn IP connections with other base stations, leading to flooding scenarios that can degrade network performance.

The misuse of existing PCIs can result in PCI collisions and confusion, leading to incorrect handovers and cell outages. Erroneous handovers not only disrupt the network equilibrium at the time of the attack but may also have lasting effects on the affected base station. A base station with a handover success rate below 95% may be disconnected (and blacklisted) from the network until it is recovered, as reported in [46, 50]. Cell outages can occur because the PCI optimization procedure will be invoked to reboot the affected base station and renew its PCI. Similar issues can arise in 5G networks [9, 12], depending on the implementation.

### 7.3 Further Discussion

Based on our experimentation, we provide additional important details:

#### Are Forced/Blind Handovers Affected by Handover Attacks?

Forced or blind handovers are used when the network needs to immediately move the UE from one cell to another without using Measurement Reports (MRs). Although an attacker cannot directly manipulate this type of handover due to the absence of MRs, they can block the handover from occurring. Our experiments show that if the attacker's signal power is high enough even milliseconds before the handover, they can cause malicious attachment, leading to handover failures on the network side. The results of such an attack are similar to typical handover cases. We were able to replicate these blind handovers using an Intra-Base station setup and by issuing handover commands on the Amarisoft eNodeB/gNodeB terminal.

#### Does the UE Fail to Connect to the Malicious Base Station During the Initial HO RACH?

Synchronization and a successful Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure are crucial for handovers. If these components fail, the UE will not properly attach to the new base station or cell, leading to errors. The attacker, despite emulating the legitimate base station, cannot provide the required smooth transition. However, we observed that this issue does not significantly affect the attack, as the UE will still attempt to communicate and attach to the false cell. The attacker can perform Denial of Service (DoS) or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks in most cases, regardless of the initial abnormality.

#### Is There Any Real-Time Detection Mechanism?

Attachment to the malicious base station is not always as seamless as theory suggests. While a handover attack may succeed, it can also fail and leave traces of abnormal traffic. For example, the UE may exchange multiple Radio Resource Control (RRC) Reconfiguration messages with the source base station before disconnection. A detection mechanism placed in the Radio Access Network (RAN) can easily evaluate the traffic and identify inconsistencies such as handover failures, timer expirations, and unnecessary messages, especially with the use of machine learning models. Each eNodeB/gNodeB maintains a record of temporary identifiers for each UE, including {RAN_UE_NGAP_ID, AMF_UE_NGAP_ID, Cell_ID, RNTI} in 5G and {eNB_UE_NGAP_ID, MME_UE_NGAP_ID, Cell_ID, RNTI} in LTE. During an attack, these records can be abused, containing inconsistent values, short ID lifetimes, and unnecessary records related to the affected UE due to traffic instability.

### 8. Related Work

Serious vulnerabilities affecting 5G and its predecessors have been repeatedly documented [27, 31, 42, 44, 45, 20, 47], even though 5G's security baseline is more robust. Security flaws have been uncovered in various network components, such as the authentication mechanism [21], unprotected RRC and NAS messages [35], insecure roaming protocols (e.g., Diameter and SS7) [29], and unencrypted sensitive information (IMSI, IMEI, etc.) [24, 39]. These vulnerabilities make the system susceptible to a wide range of attacks, from passive network scanning and IMSI catching to active exploitation. The ability of attackers to set up false base stations using inexpensive hardware, transmit at cellular radio frequencies, replay legitimate broadcast messages, and interfere with unprotected cellular procedures further facilitates the discovery and exploitation of weaknesses.

Yang et al. [52] investigated the physical-layer exploitation of pre-authentication traffic on LTE using injections and signal overshadowing. For handover specifically, [46] and [8] have reported some preliminary results on handover attacks, indicating that an attacker can take advantage of unverified measurement reports in X2 and Xn handover cases, respectively. Proper key management has been explored [28], but it remains inadequate since our proposed attacks circumvent LTE’s and 5G’s encryption and integrity-protection mechanisms.

Table 3 provides an overview of false base station attacks, their focus, and impact in related academic work.

### 9. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the methodology and detailed steps for exploiting cellular handover procedures. We identified the main security flaws related to the handover process, which affect all generations and cases. We emphasized the implications of unverified measurement reports and insecure broadcast messages, explaining their impact on both the UE and the network. Through meticulous experimentation, we verified that DoS, MitM, and information leakage are possible using both open-source and closed-source software.
