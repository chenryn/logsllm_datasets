also have evident impact on the network as the next section ex-
plains.
7.2 Impact on the Network
The UE is not the only entity affected by the attacks, the impact
is substantial for the network as well. The network wastes its re-
sources if a malicious base station triggers a handover, because the
UE will attach to the false base station and the network will wait
for acknowledgement responses. Eventually, the timers will expire
and the whole preparation will be rendered futile.
The ANR and the PCI optimization functions in LTE [16] are also
impacted according to [46]. In the case of a handover attack, the
genuine base station will be forced to search and get X2/Xn IPs in
order to establish redundant X2/Xn connections between base sta-
tions, resulting in flooding scenarios that may lead to performance
degradation.
In addition, the malignant use of PCIs that already exist will
result in PCI collisions and confusions, and consequently to incor-
rect handovers and cell outages. Erroneous handovers not only can
disrupt the network equilibrium at the moment of the attack, but
may also have lasting effects for the afflicted base station. A base
station that has a handover success rate lower than 95% may be
disconnected (and blacklisted) from the network until it is recov-
ered [46, 50]. Cell outages are possible because the PCI optimization
procedure will be invoked to reboot the affected base station in
order to renew its PCI. Similar functionalities can be observed in
5G networks [9, 12] which may introduce issues depending on the
implementation.
7.3 Further Discussion
We report on further important details based on our experimenta-
tion.
Are forced/blind handovers affected by handover attacks?
Forced/Blind handovers are used when the network needs to move
the UE from one cell to another immediately without the use of
an MR. Even though an attacker cannot manipulate this handover
directly due to MR absence, he/she might block this handover from
happening in the first place. According to our experiments, if the
attacker’s signal power is high enough even milliseconds before
the handover takes place, he/she can impose malicious attachment
causing handover failures on the network side. The results of such
an attack could be similar to the typical handover cases. We were
able to replicate the blind handovers by having the Intra-Base sta-
tion setup as described earlier and by using handover command on
the Amarisoft eNodeB/gNodeB terminal.
Does the UE fail to connect to the malicious base station
during the initial HO RACH? Synchronization and successful
RACH procedure are vital components of the handovers. Other-
wise, the UE will not attach appropriately to its new base station
or cell leading to errors. The attacker cannot offer the required
smooth transition during the attack, even though he/she emulates
the legitimate base station as precisely as possible. Nonetheless, we
noticed that this issue does not affect the attack considerably, since
the UE will still try to communicate and attach to the false cell. The
attacker can DoS or perform MitM in most cases regardless of this
initial abnormality.
Is there any real-time detection mechanism? Attachment
to the malicious base station is not always as smooth as it is pre-
sented in theory. A handover attack may succeed but it is also likely
to fail and most importantly leave traces related to abnormal traffic.
One example is when the UE exchanges multiple RRC Reconfigura-
tion messages with the source base station before disconnection. A
detection mechanism placed in the RAN network can easily evalu-
ate the traffic and easily identify inconsistencies (handover failures,
timer expiration, unnecessary messages, etc), especially with the
use of machine learning models. In addition, each eNodeB/gNodeB
holds a record of temporary identifiers for each UE with the form:
{RAN _U E NGAP ID, AMF_U E NGAP ID, Cell ID, RNT I} in 5G
and {eN B_U E NGAP ID, MME_U E NGAP ID, Cell ID, RNT I} in
LTE. We noticed that during an attack the list of records can be
abused containing inconsistent values, short ID lifetimes and un-
necessary records related to the affected UE due to traffic instability.
8 RELATED WORK
We have repeatedly witnessed serious vulnerabilities that affect
5G’s predecessors [27, 31, 42, 44, 45], but also 5G itself [20, 47],
even though its security baseline is more robust. Security flaws
have been uncovered regarding various network components, such

as the authentication mechanism [21], the unprotected RRC and
NAS messages [35], the insecure roaming protocols (e. g., Diameter
and SS7) [29] and the unencrypted sensitive information (IMSI,
IMEI, etc.) [24, 39]. Therefore, the system is vulnerable to an ex-
tensive number of attacks that can range from passive network
scanning and IMSI catching to active exploitation. Furthermore, the
capability of the attacker to setup false base stations using inexpen-
sive hardware [45], transmit at cellular radio frequencies, replay
legitimate broadcast messages, and interfere with unprotected cel-
lular procedures makes it easier to discover and exploit weaknesses.
Yang et al. [52] investigated the physical-layer exploitation of the
pre-authentication traffic on LTE using mainly injections and sig-
nal overshadowing. For handover specifically, [46] and [8] have
reported some elementary results on handover attacks indicating
that an attacker can take advantage of the unverified measurement
reports on X2 and Xn handover cases, respectively. Proper key man-
agement has been explored [28], but it remains inadequate since
our proposed attacks circumvent LTE’s and 5G’s encryption and
integrity-protection altogether like in the measurement report.
Table 3 presents false base station attacks, their focus and impact
in the related academic work.
9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the attack methodology and the detailed
steps for cellular handover exploitation. We identified the main
security flaws related to the handover procedure which affect all
generations and cases. We emphasize on the implications of the
unverified measurement reports and insecure broadcast messages
explicating the impact on both the UE and network. Finally, through
a meticulous experimentation we were able to verify that DoS, MitM
and information leakage are possible by using both open source
and closed source software.
