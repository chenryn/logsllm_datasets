User: I have a python script that does some updates on my database.
The files that this script needs are saved in a directory at around 3AM by some other process.
So I'm going to schedule a cron job to run daily at 3AM; but I want to handle the case if the file is not available exactly at 3AM, it could be delayed by some interval.
So I basically need to keep checking whether the file of some particular name exists every 5 minutes starting from 3AM. I'll try for around 1 hour, and give up if it doesn't work out. 
How can I achieve this sort of thing in Python?
Assistant: You can use Twisted, and it is reactor it is much better than an infinite loop ! Also you can use reactor.callLater(myTime, myFunction), and when myFunction get called you can adjust the myTime and add another callback with the same API callLater().
