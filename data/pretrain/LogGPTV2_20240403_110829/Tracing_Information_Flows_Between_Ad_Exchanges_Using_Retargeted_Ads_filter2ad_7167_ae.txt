Table 2: Top 25 cookie matching partners in our dataset. The arrow signifies whether we observe forward matches (→),
backward matches (←), or both (↔). The heuristics for detecting cookie matching are: DC (match using DoubleClick
URL parameters), E (string match for exact cookie values), US (URLs that include parameters like “usersync”), and -
(no identifiable mechanisms). Note that the HTTP request formats used for forward and backward matches between a
given pair of exchanges may vary.
that was identified solely by the AMT workers (contain-
ing 1,359 retargets).
We observe that cookie matching frequency is heav-
ily skewed towards several heavy-hitters. In aggregate,
Google’s domains are most common, which makes sense
given that Google is the largest ad exchange on the Web
today. The second most common is Criteo;
this re-
sult also makes sense, given that Criteo specializes in
retargeted advertising [15]. These observations remain
broadly true across the AMT and complete datasets: al-
though the relative proportion of ads and chains from
less-frequent exchange pairs differs somewhat between
the two datasets, the heavy-hitters do not change. Fur-
thermore, we also see that the vast majority of exchange
pairs are identified in both datasets.
Interestingly, we observe a great deal of heterogene-
ity with respect to the directionality of cookie match-
ing. Some boutique exchanges, like Adacado, only in-
gest cookies from other exchanges. Others, like Criteo,
are omnivorous, sending or receiving data from any and
all willing partners. These results suggest that some par-
ticipants are more wary about releasing their user identi-
fiers to other exchanges.
Comparison to Prior Work.
We observe many of
the same participants matching cookies as prior work, in-
cluding DoubleClick, Rubicon, AppNexus, OpenX, Me-
diaMath, and myThings [2, 54, 21]. Prior work identifies
some additional ad exchanges that we do not (e.g., Turn);
this is due to our exclusive focus on participants involved
in retargeted advertising.
However, we also observe participants (e.g., Ada-
cado and AdRoll) that prior work does not. This may
be because prior work identifies cookie matching us-
ing heuristics to pick out specific features in HTTP re-
quests [43, 2, 54, 21]. In contrast, our categorization ap-
proach is content and mechanism agnostic.
To investigate the efficacy of heuristic detection meth-
ods, we applied three of them to our dataset. Specifi-
cally, for each pair (s, d) of exchanges that we categorize
as cookie matching, we apply the following tests to the
HTTP headers of requests between s and d or vice-versa:
1. We look for specific keys that are known to be
used by DoubleClick and other Google domains for
cookie matching (e.g., “google_nid” [54]).
2. We look for cases where unique cookie values set
by one participant are included in requests sent to
the other participant5.
5To reduce false positives, we only consider cookie values that have
length >10 and 100%. The last
two columns count the number of unique e-commerce
sites that embed resources from a given domain, and the
unique number of ads served by the domain.
Based on the data in Table 3, we can roughly cluster
the ad domains into two groups, corresponding to SSPs
and DSPs. DSPs have low or zero out-degree since they
often appear at position pn, i.e., they serve an ad and ter-
minate the chain. Criteo is the largest source of retar-
geted ads in our dataset by an order of magnitude. This
