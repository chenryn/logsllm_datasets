 **Matthew T. Adams** opened **SPR-8835** and commented
I couldn't find a factory bean that combines maps, and the feature of merging
collections among parent & child beans
(http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-
reference/html/beans.html#beans-collection-elements) didn't suit my needs, so
I created MapCombiningFactoryBean. Please add to Spring core if you see fit.
