**Matthew T. Adams** opened **SPR-8835** and provided the following comment:

I was unable to locate a factory bean that could combine maps, and the existing feature for merging collections between parent and child beans (as described in the Spring Framework documentation: [Collection Elements](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-collection-elements)) did not meet my requirements. As a result, I developed the `MapCombiningFactoryBean`. I believe this could be a valuable addition to the Spring core, and I kindly request that you consider including it.
