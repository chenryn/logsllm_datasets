 **Dave Syer** opened **SPR-7192** and commented
Example from Chris's DIStyles presentation:
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(TellerUI.class,
InMemoryAccountRepository.class, TransferServiceImpl.class,
FlatFeePolicy.class);  
TransferService transferService = context.getBean(TransferService.class);
This works fine now if all the types have explicitly `@Autowired`
constructors, it would be great if those components could just be autowirable
(implicitly). All we would need would be to optimistically register a bean
definition for any class where we don't find explicit `@Autowired`
instructions.

**Issue Links:**
  * #16883 Make `@Autowired` optional on a single constructor of a class decorated with `@Component` ( _ **"duplicates"**_ )
