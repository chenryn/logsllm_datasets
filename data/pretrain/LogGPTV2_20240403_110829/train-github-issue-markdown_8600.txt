I read this discussion about `max` and `maximum` returning `NaN` when the
collection includes `NaN`. For example,
    julia> VERSION
    v"0.7.0-DEV.82"
    julia> v = [1.0, NaN, 2.0]
    3-element Array{Float64,1}:
       1.0
     NaN
       2.0
    julia> maximum(v)
    NaN
However, `findmax` still returns the maximum among non-NaN values and its
index:
    julia> findmax(v)
    (2.0, 3)
This seems inconsistent. Is this something intended or a bug?
