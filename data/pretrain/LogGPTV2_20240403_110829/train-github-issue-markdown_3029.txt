Hello,

It would be very helpful if the `issymmetric` function could accept arguments to specify the absolute and/or relative tolerances for comparing elements in the upper and lower triangles of a matrix. This would be similar to the functionality provided by the `isapprox` function, which allows for such tolerances via the `atol` and `rtol` parameters.

Thank you!
