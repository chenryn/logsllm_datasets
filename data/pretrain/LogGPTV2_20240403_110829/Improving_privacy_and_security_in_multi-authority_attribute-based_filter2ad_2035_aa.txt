## Abstract
Attribute-based encryption (ABE) [13] determines decryption ability based on a user’s attributes. In a multi-authority ABE scheme, multiple attribute authorities manage different sets of attributes and issue corresponding decryption keys to users. Encryptors can require that a user obtain keys for appropriate attributes from each authority before decrypting a message. Chase [5] proposed a multi-authority ABE scheme using a trusted central authority (CA) and global identifiers (GIDs). However, the CA in this construction has the power to decrypt every ciphertext, which contradicts the goal of distributing control over many potentially untrusted authorities. Additionally, the use of consistent GIDs allows authorities to combine their information, compromising user privacy. This paper proposes a solution that removes the trusted central authority and protects user privacy by preventing authorities from pooling their information on specific users, thus making ABE more practical.

## 1. Introduction
We often identify people by their attributes. In 2005, Sahai and Waters [13] introduced a system (now known as key-policy ABE for threshold policies) where a sender can encrypt a message specifying an attribute set and a threshold \(d\), such that only a recipient with at least \(d\) of the given attributes can decrypt the message. However, their scheme assumes a single trusted party managing all attributes and issuing all decryption keys, which may not be realistic. Instead, different entities often manage different attributes, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles certifying driving ability or a university verifying student status. Chase [5] proposed a multi-authority ABE scheme supporting multiple authorities, each handling a different set of attributes.

However, this solution still had issues with security and user privacy.

### 1.1 Protecting User Privacy
Each authority manages different attributes, and they should issue decryption keys independently without communicating. To prevent collusion, a consistent identity (GID) is required. Unfortunately, the GID allows colluding authorities to build a complete profile of a user's attributes, compromising privacy. For example, if a user uses the ABE system in various settings, they may want to keep some information private. Some attributes, like the ability to drive, should be provable without revealing identifying information. Alternatively, a user might interact with services via a pseudonym and wish to obtain attributes without revealing their full identity.

### 1.2 Removing the Trusted Authority
Chase's solution [5] assumed a single trusted central authority (CA) in addition to the attribute authorities. The CA issued each user a unique key but also had the power to decrypt any ciphertext, contradicting the goal of distributing control. We explore whether it is possible to distribute the CA's functionality among the attribute authorities, ensuring security as long as some authorities are honest.

### 1.3 Our Contributions
We present a multi-authority ABE scheme that enhances user privacy and eliminates the need for a trusted authority. Brent Waters suggested an approach where each pair of attribute authorities shares a secret key. We formalize this idea and prove its security as long as at least two authorities are honest. Our solution uses distributed pseudorandom functions (PRF) techniques from [11].

We also introduce an anonymous key issuance protocol that allows users to communicate with authorities via pseudonyms, preventing data pooling and linking multiple attribute sets. As a building block, we construct a protocol for oblivious computation of a key, ensuring neither the authority nor the user reveals their secret information. Our results demonstrate new applications of the distributed PRF of Naor, Pinkas, and Reingold [11], and generalize the oblivious PRF techniques of Jarecki and Liu [9].

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 ABE for Different Policies
ABE generalizes IBE, where ciphertexts are associated with a single attribute (identity). Sahai and Waters [13] proposed a fuzzy IBE scheme, now described as key-policy ABE with threshold policies. Goyal et al. [8] extended this to support monotonic access formulas, and Ostrovsky, Sahai, and Waters [12] included non-monotonic access structures. Ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) was introduced by Bethencourt, Sahai, and Waters [2], where the encryptor specifies an access policy, and the key is created with respect to an attribute set. We focus on KP-ABE, considering both simple threshold and more complex monotonic access structures.

### 2.2 Multi-Authority ABE
Previous work on ABE assumed a single authority. Dividing control over multiple authorities is natural but challenging, especially in preventing collusion. Chase's original proposal [5] used a trusted CA, which compromises security and privacy. Lin et al. [10] proposed a multi-authority ABE without a CA but only achieves m-resilience, meaning security is guaranteed against up to \(m\) colluding users. Our scheme remains secure against any number of colluding users, addressing a significant open problem in designing efficient and secure multi-authority ABE.

### 2.3 Anonymous Credentials
Anonymous credential systems allow users to obtain and prove possession of credentials while remaining anonymous. Each user has a unique secret key, and interactions with authorities use pseudonyms. We apply these techniques to ABE, allowing users to obtain decryption keys without revealing their GIDs. The GID acts as the secret key, and users interact with authorities using pseudonyms derived from this value, ensuring privacy and unlinkability.
