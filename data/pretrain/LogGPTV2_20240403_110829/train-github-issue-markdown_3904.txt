It's a little sad that this isn't defined. For instance, in
VectorizedRoutines.jl, the implementation of `rep` taking a number as the
first argument has to either create a temporary array, or duplicate code, or
create an immutable `AbstractArray` subtype that wraps a number. Neither are
very attractive.
Is there any reason why the definition
    eachindex(::Number) = 1
does not exist? I realize `Number`s are not `AbstractArray`s, but neither are
`Tuple`s or `Associative`s. If this definition seems acceptable to most, I'll
make a PR.
