User: How to achieve high availability and disaster recovery of the database? Please introduce common database high availability technologies and solutions.
Assistant: Database high availability refers to the ability to quickly recover from failures and ensure the continuous stability of the system when encountering unexpected events (such as hardware failures, network abnormalities, or human errors, etc.) during the use of the database system. Commonly used database high-availability technologies and solutions include: 1. Database replication technology: By replicating the database to other servers, synchronization and backup between multiple copies of data can be realized. For example, MySQL's master-slave replication. 2. Database mirroring technology: the data of one database instance is backed up to another database instance. When the primary instance fails, the mirror instance can be quickly switched to the primary instance to ensure uninterrupted services. For example, SQL Server database mirroring. 3. Database cluster technology: connect database instances through the network to jointly manage the same data set to achieve data sharing and load balancing. For example, Oracle's Real Application Cluster, MySQL's Cluster, etc. 4. Database fault monitoring technology: By monitoring each component of the database system, faults can be found in time and dealt with. For example, Oracle's Automatic Diagnostic Repository, MySQL's Percona Toolkit, etc. 5. Database backup and recovery technology: by regularly backing up the database and restoring it in time when data is lost or the system is down, to ensure data integrity and reliability. For example, MySQL's mysqldump, Oracle's Recovery Manager, etc. These technologies and solutions can be used alone or in combination to achieve high availability and disaster recovery, and ensure the availability and stability of the database system.
