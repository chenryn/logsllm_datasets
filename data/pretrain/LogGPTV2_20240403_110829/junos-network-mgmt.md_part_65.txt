NOTE: The minimum interval allowed is 1 minute. Configuring a low interval in an accounting
profile for a large number of filters might cause serious performance degradation.
The range for the interval statement is 1 through 2880 minutes. The default is 30 minutes.
Example: Configure a Filter Profile
Configure a filter profile:
[edit]
accounting-options {
file fw_accounting {
size 500k files 4;
}
filter-profile fw_profile1 {
file fw_accounting;
interval 60;
counters {
counter1;
counter2;
counter3;
}
}
}
firewall {
filter myfilter {
accounting-profile fw_profile1;
...
term accept-all {
then {
count counter1;
787
accept;
}
}
}
}
The filter profile, fw-profile1, writes data to the file fw_accounting. The file might look like the following:
#FILE CREATED 976825278 2000-12-14-20:21:18
#hostname host
#profile-layout fw_profile1,epoch-timestamp,filter-name,counter-name,packet-count,byte-count
fw_profile1,976826058,myfilter,counter1,163,10764
...
#FILE CLOSED 976826178 2000-12-14-20:36:18
Example: Configure Interface-Specific Firewall Counters
and Filter Profiles
To collect and log count statistics collected by firewall filters on a per-interface basis, you must configure
a filter profile and include the interface-specific statement at the [edit firewall filter filter-name]
hierarchy level.
Configure the firewall filter accounting profile:
[edit accounting-options]
file cust1_accounting {
size 500k;
}
filter-profile cust1_profile {
file cust1_accounting;
interval 1;
counters {
r1;
}
}
788
Configure the interface-specific firewall counter:
[edit firewall]
filter f3 {
accounting-profile cust1_profile;
interface-specific;
term f3-term {
then {
count r1;
accept;
}
}
}
Apply the firewall filter to an interface:
[edit interfaces]
xe-1/0/0 {
unit 0 {
family inet {
filter {
input f3;
output f3;
}
address 20.20.20.30/24;
}
}
}
The following example shows the contents of the cust1_accounting file in the /var/log folder that might
result from the preceding configuration:
#FILE CREATED 995495212 2001-07-18-22:26:52
#hostname host
#profile-layout cust1_profile,epoch-timestamp,interfaces,filter-name,
counter-name,packet-count,byte-count
cust1_profile,995495572,xe-1/0/0.0,f3-xe-1/0/0.0-i,r1-xe-1/0/0.0-i,5953,1008257

...
789
If the interface-specific statement is not included in the configuration, the following output might result:
#FILE CREATED 995495212 2001-07-18-22:26:52
#hostname host
#profile-layout cust1_profile,epoch-timestamp,interfaces,filter-name,
counter-name,packet-count,byte-count
cust1_profile,995495572,xe-1/0/0.0,f3,r1,5953,1008257
cust1_profile,995495632,xe-1/0/0.0,f3,r1,5929,1006481

Alarm Overview
SUMMARY IN THIS SECTION
This section describes interface alarms and how to Alarm Types | 799
configure them.
Alarm Severity | 800
Alarm Conditions | 801
Alarms alert you to conditions on a network interface, on the device chassis, or in the system software
that might prevent the device from operating normally. You can set the conditions that trigger alarms on
an interface. Chassis and system alarm conditions are preset.
An active alarm lights the ALARM LED on the front panel of the device. You can monitor active alarms
from the J-Web user interface or the CLI. When an alarm condition triggers an alarm, the device lights
the yellow (amber) ALARM LED on the front panel. When the condition is corrected, the light turns off.
Alarm Types
The device supports three types of alarms:
• Interface alarms indicate a problem in the state of the physical links on fixed or installed Physical
Interface Modules (PIMs). To enable interface alarms, you must configure them.
• Chassis alarms indicate a failure on the device or one of its components. Chassis alarms are preset
and cannot be modified.
800
• System alarms indicate a missing rescue configuration or software license, where valid. System alarms
are preset and cannot be modified, although you can configure them to appear automatically in the J-
Web user interface or CLI.
Starting with Junos OS Release 15.1X49-D60 and Junos OS Release 17.3R1, a new system alarm is
