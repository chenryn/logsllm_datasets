Currently debug adapter user errors are treated like fatal exceptions on the
VS Code side and show up in the dev console because "developers should
understand what is going on". This does not make a lot of sense for this type
errors because no developer needs to know them or is interested in them.
The errors reporting through this mechanism are conceptually equivalent to
errors reported by the TypeScript transpiler but it would be strange if we
would send TypeScript errors to the dev console.
I suggest that we only show errors on the dev console that have the
"sendTelemetry" flag set. The errors that have the "showUser" flag set are
forwarded to the Notification service without sending them to the dev console.
