### Global Data Model and Semantic Integration

Global data models, based on semantic data models, are formally specified using the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) (BPEL4WS, 2003). BPEL4WS provides a formal language for specifying business processes, facilitating automated process integration in both intra-organizational and B2B settings. Semantic data models are interfaced with Web services, as described by Chinnici et al. (2003).

#### BPEL4WS and Web Services

BPEL4WS offers a robust framework for defining and integrating business processes. At runtime, these processes invoke Web services, which provide an efficient solution for reducing integration efforts and accelerating the creation of interfaces that communicate with semantic data models. In dynamic packaging applications, Web service-based solutions offer several advantages:

- **Loosely Coupled Integration:** Reduces development costs and increases flexibility.
- **Standardized Interfaces:** Simplifies the complexity of dynamic packaging applications.

Web services are easier to design, implement, and deploy compared to traditional distributed technologies like RPC and CORBA. The foundational technologies of Web services include XML, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI), and Web Services Description Language (WSDL). These standards enable seamless communication between different programs, regardless of the programming languages or platforms used.

#### Shared Global Data Model

To develop efficient dynamic packaging applications, a shared global data model across participating tourism information systems is essential. This model does not require a common hardware platform or database vendor but ensures that all participants have a unified understanding of the data. A shared global data model minimizes integration costs and efforts, allowing dynamic packaging applications to merge information from various sources such as CRS, GDS, HDS, DMS, and travel agents' websites, enabling cross-departmental and cross-organizational integration.

Our shared global data model is represented using an ontology, providing a common understanding of tourism data and information (Figure 9).

- **Loose Coupling:**
  1. Single organizational entity overseeing information resources.
  2. Adoption of common DBMSs at participating sites.
  3. Shared data model across participating sites.
  4. Common semantics for data publishing.

- **Tightly Coupled:**
  5. Common syntax for data publishing.

#### Shared Common Vocabulary

A shared global data model is only useful if the integrated sources share a common vocabulary. Different data models can be used to add semantics, including controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies. 

- **Controlled Vocabularies:** Lists of terms with unambiguous and non-redundant definitions.
- **Taxonomies:** Hierarchical classifications of controlled vocabulary terms.
- **Thesauri:** Networked collections of controlled vocabulary terms with conceptual relationships.
- **Ontologies:** Richer semantic relationships among terms and attributes, with strict rules for term and relationship specification.

Ontologies provide a higher degree of expressiveness and are supported by standards like OWL. Therefore, we have selected ontologies for our dynamic packaging architecture to explicitly connect data from tourism information systems and allow machine-processable interpretation of data.

#### Semantic Integration

For dynamic packaging applications, a common modeling language is needed to describe data, information, and knowledge. An ontology is required to determine semantically equivalent expressions and concepts in heterogeneous data sources. After studying various travel, leisure, and transportation sites, we found significant inconsistencies in terminology and conventions, such as:

- Syntactic differences in words with the same semantics (e.g., tennis/tenis, walking/caminhadas).
- Price expressions in different currencies.
- Non-standard time and date formats.
- Variations in temperature unit scales.
- Non-normalized numerical value expressions.

These inconsistencies highlight the need for a standardized approach. Semantics and ontologies are effective solutions for dynamic packaging information systems, as they allow the association of metadata to data sources, making the data machine-understandable and processable.

#### E-Tourism Ontologies

Ontologies are crucial for shifting from syntactic to semantic integration and interoperability. They provide explicit and formal descriptions of concepts and their relationships, enabling a shared, organized, and common understanding of data. For dynamic packaging applications, ontologies are needed to identify destinations, activities, weather forecasts, places, dates, and relationships.

We identified two types of ontologies:
- **Local Ontologies:** Define the semantics of specific tourism data source domains (e.g., hotels, car rentals, airlines).
- **Shared Global Ontologies:** Common semantics shared between all tourism domains and information systems.

#### Ontology Language Selection

Several languages support the Semantic Web, including RDF, RDFS, DAML+OIL, and OWL. We selected OWL for developing our e-tourism ontologies due to its standardization by the W3C and its rich set of primitives for building expressive ontologies.

#### Editor Selection

Choosing the right ontology editor is critical. Popular editors include OilEd, OntoEdit, WebODE, and Protégé. After analysis, we selected Protégé for its extensibility, platform independence, and support for OWL, RDF, and XML formats.
