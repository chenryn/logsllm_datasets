User: In Linux, how to find all files in a specified directory and display the file path and line number in the result?
Assistant: You can use the following command to achieve: ``` grep -rn "search content" specified directory ``` where: - `-r` means recursively search for all files in the specified directory. - `-n` means to display the line number in front of the matching result. - `"Search Content"` is the keyword to look for. - `specified directory` is the directory path to look for. For example, to find all files containing the string `example` in the directory `/home/user/docs`, and display the file path and line number, you can use the following command: ``` grep -rn "example" /home/ user/docs ``` The output is similar to: ``` /home/user/docs/file1.txt:5:This is an example sentence. /home/user/docs/file2.txt:15:Another example sentence. / home/user/docs/subdir/file3.txt:10:This file also has an example in it. ```
