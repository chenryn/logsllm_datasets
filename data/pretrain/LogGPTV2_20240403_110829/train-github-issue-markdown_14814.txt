Hi.  
Perhaps this has already been discussed, but I did not find.
IBM is already successfully experimenting with this.  
https://github.com/IBM/browser-functions/blob/master/docs/index.md
There are a lot of advantages in this approach, native `Web API` from the
browser manufacturer, `SSR` out of the box, only the I/O (fs, net) in the
userland is missing, Deno can provide it.
How's the idea for you?
