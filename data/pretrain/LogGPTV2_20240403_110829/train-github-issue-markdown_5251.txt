Using 0.209.0 on Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, Atom (even in safe mode) will no longer
open a new first-and-only window with the session state (open folder and open
files) from the previous last-to-be-closed Atom window.  
#6917 seems similar, but that was fixed. I guess this might be a regression,
unless it was a deliberate choice. I found no issue or changelog or release
notes that mentioned it.
I believe 0.208.0 restored the previous session, and the last version in which
the previous session wasn't restored was some time ago, maybe around 0.197.0
or so but not sure. Even then, File / Exit seemed to allow session restoring,
while the window's close button did not. Now, neither seem to allow the
previous session to be restored. (File / Close Window doesn't currently work
either, but I hadn't checked it closely in previous versions.)
