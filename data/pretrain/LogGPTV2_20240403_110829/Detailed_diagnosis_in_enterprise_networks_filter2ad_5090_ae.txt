### 7.2 Effectiveness of Diagnosis

Figure @(a) illustrates the effectiveness of NetMedic and Coarse in diagnosing faults injected into a live environment. The lines in the figure represent the median ranks, while the error bars indicate the maximum ranks. The two curves are sorted independently based on the median rank.

**Figure @:**
- **(a)** Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the percentage of components that are abnormal during a fault.
- **(b)** CDF of the percentage of edges assigned a high weight (> 0.75) in the dependency graph.

#### Analysis of NetMedic's Performance
For approximately 80% of the faults, NetMedic assigns a median rank of one to the correct cause, indicating that it frequently identifies the real culprit as the most likely cause. In all but one case, the median rank of the correct cause is five or lower. The close proximity of the maximum ranks to the median ranks suggests good worst-case performance. These results indicate that NetMedic can effectively assist operators in diagnosing network faults.

#### Comparison with Coarse
In contrast, Coarse performs less effectively. The correct cause is ranked first in fewer than 60% of the cases, and for over 40% of the cases, the correct cause has a median rank greater than ten. 

We examined instances where NetMedic assigned a median rank greater than three to the correct cause. These often correspond to performance-related faults, such as those listed in Table 3 (Problems 1, 2, and 3). Such faults lead to abnormality in many components, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact cause. For example, a process that consumes excessive CPU resources can disrupt multiple other processes, leading to widespread abnormality. Insufficient historical data can also result in some affected components being ranked lower than the actual cause.

Non-performance faults, which are more common (ยง3.2), are easier to diagnose as they typically affect fewer components. 

### 7.3 Why NetMedic Outperforms Coarse

NetMedic outperforms Coarse primarily because, at the level of detail observed, many components are often abnormal. This leads Coarse to assign high weights to numerous edges, erroneously connecting non-responsible components to the observed effects. By analyzing component states in detail and allowing for complex dependencies, NetMedic assigns low weights to many edges, even when both endpoints are abnormal.

**Figure @(a):** 
- CDF of the percentage of components that are abnormal during various faults. The percentage is typically high (50-70%).

**Figure @(b):** 
- CDF of the percentage of edges in the dependency graph assigned a high weight (> 0.75). For Coarse, this percentage is 60-70%, while for NetMedic, it is 20-30%, representing a reduction by a factor of 3. This reduction in spurious high-weight edges results in fewer false positives and lower ranks for real causes.

Simply increasing the threshold for deeming a component abnormal may reduce false positives but risks excluding the real culprit from the list.

### 7.4 Benefit of Extensions

To evaluate the value of the extensions to edge weight assignment, we compare NetMedic to two other methods:
1. **Basic Procedure:** Without the extensions.
2. **HandPicked Method:** Manually coding relationships between variables based on their known semantics.

**Figure @(a):** 
- Compares the diagnostic effectiveness of the basic procedure, Coarse, and HandPicked. The basic procedure more frequently assigns a rank of one to the correct cause (90% vs. 60% for Coarse). However, it is fragile, assigning higher ranks to the correct cause in the worst 10% of cases compared to Coarse.

The extensions make the basic idea more practical, achieving an 80% frequency of assigning a rank of one to the correct cause and significantly reducing the ranks for half the faults. Performance faults, which have more side effects, benefit particularly from these extensions.

**Figure @(a):** 
- Shows that NetMedic's performance is close to that of the HandPicked method, indicating that the extensions extract sufficient semantic information without requiring embedded knowledge of variable semantics.

**Figure @(b):** 
- Illustrates the median rank for the 80th and 90th percentiles of faults using the basic procedure, only the abnormality extension, and NetMedic with all extensions. Both factoring in abnormality and inferring variable relationships are useful.

### 7.5 Multiple Simultaneous Faults

Finally, we study NetMedic's ability to diagnose multiple, simultaneously occurring faults in a dynamic network.
