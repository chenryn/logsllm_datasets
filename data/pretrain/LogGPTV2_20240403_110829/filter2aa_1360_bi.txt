I attempted a search on Twitter of fromiWcstCornfield, which provided no results. I conducted a search of 
to:WestComfield, which provided dozens of incoming messages from his friends. This was a good start. 1 then 
went to Google and conducted a search for "Twitter WestComfield". The first search result was a link to the 
user's live Twitter page. Instead of clicking on the link, I chose the Google Cache view of his profile by clicking 
the small green "down arrow" next to the URL and selecting "Cached". This view identified twenty deleted 
Tweets from this account. Two of these posts can be seen in Figure 11.04. Google identified this capture as 
taken on December 12, 2017.
The result was 56 posts. \XTicn I clicked on each of these, Twitter informed me that the post had been deleted. 
However, opening the cached version from the Google result displayed each of the posts. In Figure 11.06, you 
can sec that Google is now identifying deleted posts as far back as October 2017. This process should also be 
repeated using the cached view options of Bing and Yandex. Next, we should check the \X ayback Machine as 
mentioned in Chapter Eight. If you recall, you can search their archives by keywords or direct URL. The 
following address connects us directly to their archive of his account.
This identified a capture of his profile on December 6, 2017. Opening this archive displayed his Twitter profile 
dating back to November 8,2017. Figure 11.07 displays this deleted Tweet.
While our target removed his content from his profile, he did not remove his history. In order to see the Twitter 
posts that he had previously liked before wiping out his page, we can navigate to the following U1 • n 11 
example, we sec the hundreds of messages that identify his interests.

The worst part about trying to be a nice person that Is also a comedian is how 
many people expect you to book gigs for them.
After removing "&name=small" from the URL, the full image is available. You can save this image by right­
clicking and choosing "Save image as". This example is as follows.
Assume that you have identified an individual Tweet of interest. The URL of the message will appear similar to 
https://twitter.com/lntelTechniques/status/1318928116253814785. You have die tools to create a screen 
capture, but you may want a few more details. If there is an image embedded into the Tweet, you can click on 
it to sec a larger version. However, this is sometimes not the original image size. In order to see die original full- 
size version, right-click the image and choose "View image". This will load a new URL such as the following.

Tweet Deck (tweetdeck.twitter.com)
194 Chapter 11
The User1 option will allow you to enter a Twitter username and monitor all incoming and outgoing public 
messages associated with the user. If several subjects of an investigation are identified as Twitter users, each of 
the profiles can be loaded in a separate column and monitored. Occasionally, this will result in two of the profiles 
communicating with each other while being monitored.
If we return to the message, we can see the date and time of the post directly below the content. In this scenario, 
it was posted on October 21, 2020 at 8:52 AM. This is likely local time to the account owner, but we should 
never assume this. If we right-click on the Tweet and choose "View' Source", we can search within the source 
code of that Tweet. While in your browser, strike "Ctrl" + "F" (Windows/Linux) or "command" + "F" (Mac) 
and search for "time_zone". This should result in one entry. In this case, it reads "Eastern Time (US Scamp; 
Canada),utc_offset>14400,tzinfo_name:America/New_York". We now know this Tweet was sent at 8:52 AM 
EST. While this may seem minor, it could be a huge deal if your investigation makes its way to a courtroom. 
Knowing exact dates and times is mandator}’.
Tweet Deck is owned by Twitter, and it can take advantage of the live Twitter "Firehose". This huge stream of 
data contains ever}' public post available on Twitter. Many Twitter services do not have access to this stream, 
and the results are limited. Tweet Deck requires you to create and log in to an account to use the service. The 
"Create Account" button on the website will walk you through the process. /Vias information is acceptable and 
preferred. The plus symbol (+) in the upper left area will add a new column to your view. There are several 
options presented, but the most common will be "Search" and "User". The "Search" option will create a column 
that will allow you to search for any keywords on Twitter. The following is a list of search examples and how 
they may benefit the investigator.
"Victim Name": A homicide investigator can monitor people mentioning a homicide victim. 
"School Name": A school can monitor anyone mentioning the school for suspicious activity. 
"Subject Name": An investigator can monitor a missing person's name for relevant information. 
"Event": Officials can monitor anyone discussing a special event such as a festival or concert.
"C C|CO Un^nS °. WCCt Deck are consistently sized. If more columns are created than can fit in the display, the 
^ns option with left and right arrows will provide navigation. This allows for numerous search columns 
regar ess o screen resolution. This is an advantage of Tweet Deck over the other services discussed. Tweet 
ls one o m} Twitter staples. I use it at some point during even’ investigation. I recommend familiarizing 
yourself with all of the features before needing to rely on it during your searches.
You can also use the Geo search mentioned earlier within Tweet Deck. A column that searches 
"geocode:43.430242,-89.736459,1km" will display a live feed of Tweets posted within the specified range. A 
more precise search of "geocode:43.430242,-89.736459,1km fight" would add the keyword to filter the resu ts. 
Figure 11.08 displays Tweet Deck with several searches.
Real World Application: In 2019,1 was investigating a death threat toward a celebrity. I launche weet 
and began monitoring. First, I created a search column with "to:myclient". This started a stream o 
people mentioning my client, which was too much to monitor. Next, I created a column of to.m} c lent ’ 
die OR shoot OR death". This presented ver}’ few tweets being sent to the celebrity including speci ic ate u 
words. However, it did identify a suspect. A tweet was sent to the celebrity stating I hope you die a ier} * ea 
tonight". I then created another column of "from:suspect to:myclient". This identified ever}’ tweet ic was 
sending to the celebrity. Since I had to move on to other resources, I set one final Tweet Deck co umn o 
"from:suspect to:myclient kill OR die OR shoot OR death" and added an alert. This instructed Tweet ec ' to 
play an audible sound if any new messages met the criteria. The same suspect was arrested a wee * ater \\ i e 
attempting to burglarize her apartment

Convert Name to ID: This is the most reliable way to take a Twitter username, such as jms_dot_py, and convert 
it to the corresponding user number, which is 817668451. This can be vital for investigations. Users can always 
change their username at any time, but the user number cannot be modified.
Tliis website provides a clean display of all of a user's Twitter posts on one screen. It will start with the most 
recent post and list previous posts on one line each. This view will display up to 3,200 messages on one scrollable 
screen. This provides two analysis methods for digesting large amounts of data. Pressing "Ctrl" + "F" on the 
keyboard will present a search box. Any search terms can be entered to navigate directly to associated messages. 
The page can also be printed for archiving or distribution to assisting analysts. This is my preferred way of 
reading through the Tweets of an active user. This also prevents you from constandy loading more Tweets at 
the end of every page throughout a profile. Currendy, I prefer TweetBeaver for this task, which is explained 
next.
Wc have reached the end of the Twitter search options within the official website. However, we are far from 
done. Next, we will focus on third-party- search tools. Most of these sendees require you to authenticate with a 
Twitter account before any queries can be submitted. This is largely due to Twitter's safeguards against fraud 
and abuse. I always recommend using a "junk" Twitter account when this is required. You will be asked to give 
the third-party service access and control of the account in order to complete any tasks. This can be a security 
and privacy risk if using your true personal account 1 will never give any service access to my real Twitter 
account, but 1 often allow services to authenticate with one of my investigation accounts.
This is currently my absolute favorite third-party- Twitter reporting tool. It is die most robust online option 
available to us for exporting content from an account or researching associations. There are currendy fourteen 
unique options within this site, and I will explain each of them with usage scenarios. Note diat you must be 
logged in to a Twitter account for any of these to work, as they all leverage the Twitter API in order to function. 
Please only use covert accounts, and never your own personal Twitter login information.

Search within a user’s favorites: If the previous technique produces too many results, this option allows you 
to filter by keyword. Since you could search within the file you downloaded or on the screen of results, I find 
this feature to be of litde use.

Search within a user’s timeline: Similar to the favorites search tool, I find this one redundant.
Download a user’s favorites: This is the first tool where we can choose to either display the results on the 
screen or download them as a CSV spreadsheet This option simply extracts a user's favorites (or likes) as 
discussed earlier. The results include the original author, date and time, text of the message, a direct URL to the 
post, and the author's bio, as seen in Figure 11.09.
Get a user’s account data: This utility provides a great summary of the account information publicly available 
from any Twitter account. The benefit of this method of obtaining the data is that it is quick and presented in a 
standard view. 1 can collect this information about many users, and all results will have the same format. This 
can aid in presentation during prosecution. Figure 11.11 displays the actual result from this target.

and TweetBeaver will extract the most recent 3,200 posts from the account. Furthermore, it will include the date

tool on the account daily. It has helped me obtain the new posts every’ day, and identify previous posts deleted 
after my initial acquisition. Figure 11.10 displays the first line of a result.
