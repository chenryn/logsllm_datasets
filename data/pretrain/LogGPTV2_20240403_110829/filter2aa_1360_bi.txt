I attempted to search for the Twitter handle @WestCornfield, but it yielded no results. However, a search using "to:WestCornfield" revealed dozens of incoming messages from his friends, providing a promising start. I then conducted a Google search for "Twitter WestCornfield," which led me to a link to the user's live Twitter page. Instead of clicking on the live link, I opted to view the Google Cache version of his profile by selecting the small green "down arrow" next to the URL and choosing "Cached." This cache view exposed twenty deleted tweets from this account, with two examples shown in Figure 11.04. The cache was captured on December 12, 2017.

The initial search resulted in 56 posts. When I clicked on each post, Twitter indicated that they had been deleted. However, the cached versions from the Google search displayed the content of these posts. As seen in Figure 11.06, Google has identified deleted posts as far back as October 2017. To ensure comprehensive coverage, this process should be repeated using the cached view options in Bing and Yandex. Additionally, we should check the Wayback Machine, as mentioned in Chapter Eight. By searching their archives using keywords or the direct URL, we can access historical snapshots of the account. For instance, the following address leads to an archived capture of his profile from December 6, 2017, displaying tweets dating back to November 8, 2017 (Figure 11.07).

Although our target removed content from his profile, he did not erase his entire history. To view the tweets he previously liked before deleting his page, we can navigate to the following URL: https://twitter.com/WestCornfield/likes/. This method reveals hundreds of messages that provide insight into his interests.

### Additional Tools and Techniques
- **TweetDeck (tweetdeck.twitter.com)**: This tool allows you to monitor all incoming and outgoing public messages associated with a Twitter username. You can create columns for multiple profiles and set up alerts for specific keywords.
- **Geo Search in TweetDeck**: Use geocode to filter tweets within a specific geographic range. For example, "geocode:43.430242,-89.736459,1km fight" will display tweets within a 1 km radius of the specified coordinates, filtered by the keyword "fight."
- **Third-Party Resources**:
  - **All My Tweets (allmytweets.net)**: Displays all of a user's tweets on one screen, up to 3,200 messages.
  - **TweetBeaver (tweetbeaver.com)**: Offers robust tools for exporting content and researching associations, including downloading a user's timeline and favorites, and bulk lookup of user account data.

### Real-World Application
In 2019, while investigating a death threat towards a celebrity, I used TweetDeck to monitor tweets. By creating a column with "to:myclient" and filtering for specific keywords like "kill OR die OR shoot OR death," I identified a suspect who was later arrested for attempting to burglarize the celebrity's apartment.

### Conclusion
By leveraging various tools and techniques, including Google Cache, the Wayback Machine, and third-party services like TweetDeck and TweetBeaver, investigators can access and analyze a wealth of information, even if the original content has been deleted.
