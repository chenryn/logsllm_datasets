Subject: Issue with Creating a Session Using `auth` Object After Upgrading to Requests 1.0.3

Hello,

I am experiencing an issue when trying to create a session using an `auth` object after upgrading the `requests` library from version 0.14.2 to 1.0.3. The code that previously worked in 0.14.2 now throws an error in 1.0.3.

### Environment
- Python: 2.7.2+ (default, Oct 4 2011, 20:03:08) [GCC 4.6.1] on Linux
- Requests: 1.0.3

### Code and Error
```python
import requests
print(requests.__version__)  # Output: '1.0.3'

# Create an HTTPDigestAuth object
auth = requests.auth.HTTPDigestAuth('admin', '1234')
print(auth)  # Output: <requests.auth.HTTPDigestAuth object at 0xb715c9ec>

# Attempt to create a session with the auth object
try:
    session = requests.Session(auth=auth)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Output: TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'auth'

# Create a session without the auth object
session = requests.Session()
print(session)  # Output: <requests.sessions.Session object at 0xb715c9cc>

# Try with a tuple for auth
auth = ('user', 'pass')
print(auth)  # Output: ('user', 'pass')

# Attempt to create a session with the auth tuple
try:
    session = requests.Session(auth=auth)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Output: TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'auth'
```

### Summary
- The `requests.Session()` method no longer accepts the `auth` parameter in version 1.0.3.
- This was working in version 0.14.2.
- I have tried both `HTTPDigestAuth` and a simple tuple for authentication, but both attempts result in the same `TypeError`.

Could you please provide guidance on how to correctly use the `auth` object with sessions in the new version of the `requests` library?

Thank you,
