    "name": "doctrine/orm",
    "version": "v2.4.8",
    "source": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2.git",
        "reference": "464b5fdbfbbeb4a65465ac173c4c5d90960f41ff"
    }
When the doctrine/ORM bundle is downloaded by composer (URL:
https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/doctrine2/zipball/464b5fdbfbbeb4a65465ac173c4c5d90960f41ff)
always the default=last version is returned. I don't know if other references
are faulty, too.
