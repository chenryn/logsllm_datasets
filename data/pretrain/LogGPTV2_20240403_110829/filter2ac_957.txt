**ATT&CK ID:** S0524  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** AndroidOS/MalLocker.B

**Description:**
AndroidOS/MalLocker.B is a malicious technique that restricts user interaction with the device's user interface (UI) by displaying a carefully crafted "call" notification screen. This technique further ensures persistent disruption by overriding the `onUserLeaveHint()` callback method, which triggers the creation of a new notification instance whenever the current one is dismissed. [1]

This approach effectively locks the user out of their device, preventing them from accessing other applications or features until the malicious notification is addressed.
