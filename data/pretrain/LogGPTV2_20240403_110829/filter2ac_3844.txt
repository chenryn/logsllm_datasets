### Title: BotConf2022 Remote Threat Reconnaissance Workshop

#### Overview
This workshop is designed to share knowledge and best practices for live triage and analysis of remote compromised systems. The goal is to support incident response, digital forensics, and malware discovery, as well as in-place analysis. Participants are encouraged to explore additional applications of the techniques and tools presented.

#### Objectives
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Learn how to perform live triage and analysis of remote systems.
- **Tool Development:** Build a personal toolkit for remote threat reconnaissance using Bitscout, an open-source Linux-based project.
- **Practical Experience:** Gain hands-on experience with both local virtual machines and 60+ live servers to simulate large-scale compromise scenarios.

#### Key Concepts
- **Remote Threat Reconnaissance:** Techniques for silent navigation through compromised assets, even in large distributed networks.
- **Stealthy Threat Discovery:** Use of "scoutware" (software for threat hunting and instant system analysis) to minimize the risk of alerting advanced threat actors.
- **Incident Response:** Strategies for responding to live cyberattacks without triggering security alerts that could lead to evidence destruction or cleanup operations.

#### Tools and Technologies
- **Bitscout:** A customizable, open-source toolkit based on a collection of free software for Linux. It can be extended with any set of tools the analyst chooses to embed before or during the operation.
- **Local Virtual Machines:** For initial practice and familiarization with the tools and techniques.
- **Live Servers:** Access to 60+ live servers for simulating and analyzing large-scale compromises. Online access will be required for this part of the workshop.

#### Why This Workshop?
- **Challenges of Traditional Methods:** Popular approaches like EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and other live agent-based solutions can trigger alerts from advanced threat actors, leading to evidence destruction and cleanup.
- **Advantages of Remote Stealthy Analysis:** Remote threat discovery with scoutware allows for silent and efficient analysis, even when physical access to the compromised system is not feasible or when dealing with large-scale networks.

#### Who Should Attend?
- Incident responders
- Digital forensic analysts
- Malware researchers
- Security professionals interested in advanced threat hunting and analysis

#### Requirements
- Basic understanding of Linux and command-line tools
- Internet access for the live server analysis portion of the workshop

By the end of the workshop, participants will have a robust toolkit and the skills needed to perform remote threat reconnaissance effectively and stealthily.
