    For some reason I am getting a build error using cgo with GLEW, I am running linux 64
    bit version and 
    go version devel +811f060da18a Thu Mar 28 15:04:25 2013 -0700 linux/amd64
    with GCC 4.8
    I get build errors such as these when trying to install GLEW
    # gl
    In file included from buffer.go:4:0:
    gl.h:4:25: error: enumerator value for '__cgo_enum__8' is not an integer constant
     #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
                             ^
    /usr/include/GL/glew.h:1685:22: note: in expansion of macro 'GLEW_GET_FUN'
     #define glGenBuffers GLEW_GET_FUN(__glewGenBuffers)
                          ^
    gl.h:4:25: error: enumerator value for '__cgo_enum__9' is not an integer constant
     #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
                             ^
    /usr/include/GL/glew.h:1679:22: note: in expansion of macro 'GLEW_GET_FUN'
     #define glBindBuffer GLEW_GET_FUN(__glewBindBuffer)
                          ^
    gl.h:4:25: error: enumerator value for '__cgo_enum__10' is not an integer constant
     #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
                             ^
    the errors continue from here but they are mostly the same. 
    The GLEW header file does 
    #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (x)
    but it needed 
    #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
    to compile properly when cgo was still working, or else one would get the error:
      could not determine kind of name for C.glDeleteBuffers
    and so on.
    I have attached my GL bindings to test with glew.
