I am encountering a build error when using cgo with GLEW on my Linux 64-bit system. My Go version is `devel +811f060da18a Thu Mar 28 15:04:25 2013 -0700 linux/amd64`, and I am using GCC 4.8.

When attempting to install GLEW, I receive the following build errors:

```
# gl
In file included from buffer.go:4:0:
gl.h:4:25: error: enumerator value for '__cgo_enum__8' is not an integer constant
 #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
                         ^
/usr/include/GL/glew.h:1685:22: note: in expansion of macro 'GLEW_GET_FUN'
 #define glGenBuffers GLEW_GET_FUN(__glewGenBuffers)
                      ^
gl.h:4:25: error: enumerator value for '__cgo_enum__9' is not an integer constant
 #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
                         ^
/usr/include/GL/glew.h:1679:22: note: in expansion of macro 'GLEW_GET_FUN'
 #define glBindBuffer GLEW_GET_FUN(__glewBindBuffer)
                      ^
gl.h:4:25: error: enumerator value for '__cgo_enum__10' is not an integer constant
 #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
                         ^
```

The errors continue in a similar fashion.

### Issue Details:
- The GLEW header file currently defines `GLEW_GET_FUN` as:
  ```c
  #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (x)
  ```
- However, to compile properly with cgo, it needed to be defined as:
  ```c
  #define GLEW_GET_FUN(x) (*x)
  ```
- If the definition was left as `(x)`, I would get errors such as:
  ```
  could not determine kind of name for C.glDeleteBuffers
  ```

### Attachments:
- GL bindings for testing: [gl.zip (6539 bytes)](gl.zip)

Please let me know if you need any further information or if there are any steps I can take to resolve this issue.
