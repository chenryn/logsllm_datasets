User: I'm trying to write a Python script which will monitor an rsync transfer, and provide a (rough) estimate of percentage progress. For my first attempt, I looked at an rsync --progress command and saw that it prints messages such as:
1614 100%    1.54MB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#5, to-check=4/10)
I wrote a parser for such messages, and used the to-check part to produce a percentage progress, here, this would be 60% complete.
However, there are two flaws in this:

In large transfers, the "numerator" of the to-check fraction doesn't seem to monotonically decrease, so the percentage completeness can jump backwards.
Such a message is not printed for all files, meaning that the progress can jump forwards.

I've had a look at other alternatives of messages to use, but haven't managed to find anything. Does anyone have any ideas?
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: You can disable the incremental recursion with the argument --no-inc-recursive.  rsync will do a pre-scan of the entire directory structure, so it knows the total number of files it has to check.
This is actually the old way it recursed.  Incremental recursion, the current default, was added for speed.
