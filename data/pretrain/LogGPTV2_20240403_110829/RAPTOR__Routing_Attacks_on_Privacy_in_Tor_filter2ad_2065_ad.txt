**Figure 9: Percentage of Tor circuits vulnerable to an AS-level adversary**

If we also consider asymmetric paths (i.e., common ASes between P1 and P4, P2 and P3, and P2 and P4), the percentage of vulnerable Tor circuits nearly doubled to 21.3% on the first day (blue line in Fig. 9), and nearly tripled to 31.8% at the end of the three-week period (green line in Fig. 9).

### 5. BGP Attacks: Hijack and Interception

In this section, we study and evaluate the feasibility of BGP hijack and interception attacks on the Tor network. First, we show that Tor relays tend to be concentrated within a few ASes and IP prefixes, making them highly attractive targets for hijack and interception attacks (§5.1). Second, we demonstrate that, in several real-world BGP hijack attacks, Tor relays were among the target prefixes (§5.2). Third, we perform a real-world BGP interception attack against a live Tor guard relay, with success, to demonstrate the ability to accurately deanonymize Tor clients (§5.3).

#### 5.1 Tor Relays Concentration

The amount of Tor traffic attracted by a hijack or an interception attack depends on the number of relays within the corresponding prefix. Therefore, prefixes and ASes hosting many high-bandwidth relays are interesting targets for attackers. To evaluate the vulnerability of the Tor network to hijack and interception attacks, we computed the number of relays present in each AS and BGP prefix. Surprisingly, close to 30% of all relays are hosted in only 6 ASes and 70 prefixes. These relays represent almost 40% of the bandwidth in the entire Tor network (see Table 5). Consequently, these few prefixes constitute extremely attractive targets.

**Table 5: 6 ASes and 70 prefixes host ∼30% of all Tor guard and exit relays as well as ∼40% of the entire Tor network bandwidth. As such, these constitute extremely attractive targets for hijacks and interceptions attacks.**

#### 5.2 Known Prefix Hijacking Attacks

While there have been numerous well-documented BGP prefix hijacks and interceptions, it was unknown whether Tor traffic was intercepted. To address this, we studied occurrences of well-known prefix hijacks and looked for leaked prefixes covering at least one Tor relay. We gathered BGP updates from Routeviews [7] around the time of each attack and filtered out unrelated ones. Overall, we found that three well-known hijacks affected Tor relays: two separate incidents involving one of Indonesia’s largest telecommunication networks, Indosat, and one malicious hijack attack aimed at stealing Bitcoins.

**Table 6: Summary statistics for known Indosat prefix hijacking events.**

| Event | # hijacked relays | # hijacked guards | # hijacked exits |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Indosat 2011 | 5 (0.24%) | 1 (0.15%) | 4 (0.44%) |
| Indosat 2014 | 44 (0.80%) | 38 (1.80%) | 17 (1.65%) |

- **Indosat 2011**: On January 14th, 2011, Indosat (AS4761) originated 2,800 new prefixes, covering 824 different ASes [2]. Seven of these prefixes affected the Tor network by covering 5 Tor relays. As discussed in Section 2, Indosat could potentially have learned information about the client IP addresses associated with each guard relay, reducing the anonymity set.
  
- **Indosat 2014**: On April 3, 2014, Indosat originated 417,038 new prefixes; it usually originates 300 prefixes [3]. This compromised 44 Tor relays, 38 of which were guard relays and 17 of which were exit relays (11 hijacked relays were both guards and exits). Table 6 shows the summary statistics of both Indosat hijacking incidents.

- **Canadian Bitcoin 2014**: From February 2014 to May 2014, an attacker compromised 51 networks at 19 different ISPs, resulting in the theft of approximately $83,000 in Bitcoin [1]. We found that 198.245.63.0/24 and 162.243.142.0/24 were hijacked and contained a Tor relay, 198.245.63.228. AS16276 (OVH) owns 198.245.63.0/24, but this prefix was hijacked by AS21548 (MTO Telecom). The Tor relay, 198.245.63.228, was a guard relay located in Montreal, Quebec.

While we do not make any claims about the intent of the above hijacking ASes, our analysis shows the existential threat of real-world routing attacks on the Tor network. Furthermore, the fact that the Tor and research communities missed noticing the presence of Tor relays among the hijacked prefixes is surprising.

#### 5.3 BGP Prefix Interception Attack Experiment

**Methodology and Setup:**

We demonstrate the feasibility of the interception attack by performing one successfully on the live Tor network. For this, we set up a machine to run as a Tor guard relay and made it reachable to the Internet by announcing a /23 prefix in BGP using Transit Portal (TP) [43]. TP enables virtual ASes to establish full BGP connectivity with the rest of the Internet by proxying their announcements via dozens of worldwide deployments. Next, we configured 50 Tor clients in PlanetLab to use our Tor guard relay as the entry relay to reach 50 web servers, also hosted in PlanetLab.

To perform the BGP prefix interception attack, we used two TP deployments (GATECH and ISI), located in different ASes. GATECH TP served as the "good" AS through which Tor traffic is normally routed, while ISI TP served as the "malicious" AS performing the interception attack. We connected the two TPs to our Tor relay machine via VPN tunnels. First, to make our Tor guard relay (running on 184.164.244.1) reachable, we advertised 184.164.244.0/23 via the GATECH TP, so that traffic destined for IP addresses within that range would be routed first to the GATECH TP and then sent to our machine via the corresponding tunnel (Fig. 10).

Next, we advertised BGP prefix 184.164.244.0/24 via the ISI TP, constituting a more-specific prefix attack against the original announcement by the GATECH TP. After the new BGP prefix announcement propagates through the internet, Tor client traffic destined for our guard will be sent to ISI instead. Since we configured the ISI TP to forward traffic to our guard machine, the Tor relay can still receive the traffic and keep the Tor connection alive after the attack (Fig. 11).

**Experiment:**

Initially, traffic is routed via GATECH and arrives at our Tor relay machine via the GATECH tunnel. After the attack, traffic drains from the GATECH tunnel and gets routed via ISI, arriving at our Tor relay machine via the ISI tunnel instead. Since the traffic still arrives at the relay machine, it is an interception attack, and the connection does not get interrupted. We used tcpdump on our relay machine, listening to the ISI tunnel, to capture client TCP acknowledgment traffic, which is exactly the data an adversary would obtain from launching such an interception attack.

In the experiment, we first launched simultaneous HTTP requests using wget at the 50 Tor clients for a 100MB file at the 50 web servers. Twenty seconds after launching the wget requests, we started announcing the more-specific prefix via ISI. We used tcpdump to capture TCP acknowledgment traffic sent from the Tor clients during the interception attack. We also used tcpdump to capture traffic at the web servers during the entire process. Finally, 300 seconds after launching the attack, we sent a withdrawal message via the ISI TP, so the traffic would be routed via GATECH again as normal.

Our interception attack successfully deanonymized Tor sources with a 90% accuracy rate. In Fig. 12, we plot the Tor traffic flow captured on our relay machine from both the GATECH and ISI tunnels. Initially, all traffic is routed via GATECH. At t = 20s, ISI starts advertising a more specific /24 prefix, which takes approximately 35 seconds to propagate through the internet and drain the traffic from GATECH. At t = 55s, traffic starts showing up via ISI, and GATECH no longer receives traffic. At t = 300s, ISI withdraws the IP prefix announcement, which takes approximately 22 seconds for the traffic to reappear on GATECH. During this interception process, the connection remains active.

The captured data from the ISI tunnel is client TCP acknowledgment traffic. We employed our Asymmetric Traffic Analysis approach, described in Section 3, with a sample size of 50 client machines and 50 server machines to perform the correlation analysis to deanonymize users' identities. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate (see Table 7).
