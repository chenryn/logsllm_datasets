of R.
3. The user places S very close to the second an-
tenna of R.
4. Pairing succeeds when R observes a sufﬁcient
number of consecutive r values whose mean is
greater than a positive threshold rH and whose
standard deviation is smaller than a threshold δt ,
and then a sufﬁcient number of consecutive r val-
ues whose mean is smaller than a negative thresh-
old rL and whose standard deviation is smaller
than a threshold δt .
Figure 2. Basic device pairing scheme
also observed that when either R or S was moving, the vari-
ation of the RSS values was large. Therefore, to prevent a
faraway attacker from causing a large RSS ratio by inducing
a large variation of the RSS values, our scheme sets a max-
imum threshold for the standard deviation of RSS ratios.
Figure 2 shows our basic pairing scheme. In this scheme,
the sender S is required to send UDP packets to the receiver
R with ﬁxed interval. Since the only useful information to
R is the RSS values, which R measures when receiving the
physical preamble of these packets, the payload in the UDP
packets is of no use to R.
3.3 Dealing with RSS inaccuracy
The basic scheme is simple and follows the Log-normal
shadowing model in Section 2.1. However, this scheme re-
lies on the assumption that the RSS values read from the de-
vice driver are linear to the real RSS values. Unfortunately,
the RSS values provided by the driver can be distorted due
to several factors. We discuss these factors and describe
how we eliminate or mitigate them.
3.3.1 RSS Saturation
The RSS value reported by the wireless driver (Intel iwl-
wiﬁ) is an integer in the range [−95,−10]. This is usually
much smaller than the dynamic range of the actual received
signal strength. As we moved the sender from a few meters
away to closer to the receiver, at ﬁrst we observed a contin-
uous increase of RSS. Then, RSS stopped increasing around
the value −10. We conjecture that the RSS value reported
by this driver saturates at the upper bound of −10.
To overcome this problem, we can reduce the transmis-
sion power of the sender. But if we reduce the transmission
power too much, we risk saturating RSS at its lower bound.
To probe for the best power level, our scheme requires the
sender to transmit a sequence of packets using different
power levels3 during the initialization stage of the protocol.
The receiver then chooses the power level at which the re-
ceived packets have the maximum RSS ratio and notiﬁes the
sender. Then, the sender will temperarily tune it transmis-
sion power to that level before it transmits the subsequent
packets for RSS measurement.
3.3.2 Automatic Rate adaptation
Another undesirable artifact that affects RSS measure-
ment is automatic rate adaptation. It allows a Wi-Fi device
to automatically select the optimal data rate for the current
wireless channel conditions.
Data rate change may trigger the change of the physical
layer preamble modulation scheme, which will affect the
RSS values. For example, 802.11g uses the OFDM modu-
lation scheme when the data rate is 54Mbps. When the data
rate is decreased to 11Mbps or lower (5.5M, 2M or 1M),
it begins to use CCK, the modulation scheme for 802.11b.
Switching between modulation scheme can causes a large
variation in reported RSS values, and make our scheme
less stable. In a multiple antenna system such as 802.11n,
the automatic rate adaptation feature might even change
the transmission antenna. This will completely defeat our
scheme. Therefore, the sender must disable automatic rate
adaptation when sending the RSS measurement packets.4
3.4 Key generation
The basic protocol in Figure 2 authenticates the sender,
but it does not generate a shared secret key for further com-
munication. [12, 28] provide approaches to derive a shared
key from the characteristics of the wireless channel.
Alternatively, we could use cryptographic techniques to
derive a shared secret. Note that key generation does not
affect the device pairing scheme in Figure 2 and in fact can
proceed in parallel with device pairing. This is because the
device pairing scheme only measures the RSS value in the
preamble of each packet while key generation uses the pay-
load of the packet.
We propose a straightforward key generation protocol,
where the sender receives a public key from the receiver,
chooses a shared secret key, encrypts the key with the re-
ceiver’s public key, and sends the encrypted key to the re-
ceiver. The receiver then decrypts the key. Since we are
only concerned with one way authentication (the receiver
authenticates the sender), there is no need to verify the re-
ceiver’s public key.
3.5 Final Protocol
Our ﬁnal protocol integrates both device pairing and key
generation, as shown in Figure 3.
1. The user moves the sender S very close to the ﬁrst an-
tenna on the receiver R and starts the protocol (e.g., by
pressing a real or virtual button on S).
2. S→R: PairRequest(). S sends a pairing request to R.
3. R→S: PairResponse(KR). R responds with its public
key KR.
4. S→R: PowerQuery(i, n), where i = 1, . . . , n and n is
the number of power levels. S sends a sequence of
packets from the lowest to the highest power levels.
5. R←S: PowerResponse(l). After receiving all the n
power query packets, R responds with the best power
level l that maximizes r = RSS1− RSS2.
6. S→R: RSSMeasuring(EKR(k)). S generates a random
session key k and encrypts it with R’s public key KR,
and continually sends the copies of the encrypted ses-
sion key to R at ﬁxed interval. Meanwhile, the user
moves the S from nearby the ﬁrst antenna on R to
nearby the second antenna on R.
7. R←S: Success(). R examines the RSS values of
all packets (containing the encrypted session key) re-
ceived at both its antennas.
If R detects a sufﬁ-
cient number of consecutive packets whose r’s mean
is above a threshold rH and whose r’s standard devi-
ation is below a threshold δt , then R decides that the
sender is nearby R’s ﬁrst antenna. Similarly, R detects
if the sender is then nearby R’s second antenna. Af-
ter R veriﬁes both these conditions, R replies with a
success message.

1dbm to 15dbm
4Our scheme does not require the sender to interfere with automatic rate
adaptation or transmission power during normal wireless communication
after device paring.
The protocol runs above the MAC layer of the network
stack. All messages except PowerQuery and RSSMeasure
need reliable transmission, i.e. a message needs to be re-
peated if it is lost.
antennas, which can be connected to the built-in Wi-Fi card
via its IPX/U.ﬂ connectors. Note that our scheme requires
no external antennas. The reasons for using external anten-
nas in this experiment are: (1) to measure the impact of the
distance between the two receiving antennas on the RSS ra-
tio since we cannot vary the distance between the internal
antennas; and (2) to evaluate whether our scheme works on
different antennas.
• Type 1: These are the internal antennas in the Dell
E5400 laptop. After disassembling the laptop, we
found that Antenna 1 is ﬁxed at the top left of its LCD
screen frame while Antenna 2 is at the top right of the
screen frame. We did not use Antenna 3.
• Type 2: These are Wi-Fi antennas for laptop mini PCI
cards with 61cm (2 feet) IPX/U.ﬂ cables.
• Type 3: These are 5 dBi omni-directional Wi-Fi an-
tennas for access points. Each of them has a RP-SMA
male interface. We connected them to the laptop using
60cm RPSMA female to IPX/U.ﬂ cables.
• Type 4: These are 60cm RP-SMA female to IPX/U.ﬂ
cables, which we used to connect Type 3 antennas to
the laptop. Here we used these cables directly as an-
tennas. We tried this type of antenna because on some
mobile devices, such as Openmoko freerunner smart-
phone, the antenna socket is used as a default antenna.
Although they allow users to attach external antennas,
few users do.
Environment The measurements reported in the rest of
this section are from experiments conducted in our lab in
a typical computer science building. The lab has several
active WiFi access points. We also purposely turned on a
microwave oven in a nearby kitchen during the experiment
to test how well our scheme tolerates interference. We also
repeated the RSS measurements outdoor and found no sig-
niﬁcant difference from the indoor measurements.
RSS measurement During all the following experiments,
we measure RSS values as follows. First, we disable all but
one antenna on the sender, so that only one antenna is used
to send all the packets. We associate the sender with the
receiver in ad-hoc mode, i.e., packets travel from the sender
to the receiver directly without going through a base station.
Both the sender and the receiver are stationary. The packets
are ping packets with 10ms interval. To eliminate the Gaus-
sian noise in the Log-normal shadowing model, we always
read RSS from 100 consecutive packets and calculate their
mean.

4 Experiments and results
4.1 Setup
Our experimental system consists of a receiver and a
sender, where the sender wishes to be paired with the re-
ceiver.
Receiver The receiver is a Dell E5400 laptop running a
modiﬁed Fedora Linux kernel version 2.6.29-rc5-wl based
on the wireless-testing tree.
The laptop has an inte-
grated 802.11n Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 wireless card, and
is equipped with three internal antennas. We did not use
any of the 802.11n-speciﬁc functions on the card – all we
needed is the ability to read the RSS values on each antenna
individually. We modiﬁed the wireless device driver, the
kernel-to-user space communication library (radiotap), and
tcpdump to read the agc and RSSI values of each frame re-
ceived by Antenna 1 and 2, respectively. RSS is computed
as:
RSS = RSSI− agc− OFFSET
where OFFSET is 44, a constant set by this Wi-Fi module,
and agc (automatic gain control) is variable for each packet.
Sender The sender is also a Dell E5400 laptop. Two of its
antennas are disabled in the driver, and all the data packets
are sent via an external antenna connecting to it.
Antennas We conducted our experiments on the follow-
ing four types of antennas. In addition to the build-in an-
tenna on the laptop, we also used three types of external
4.2 Effect of distance on RSS
4.3 Antenna gains
To show that the RSS ratio is independent of antenna
gain, we read RSS values when the packets were sent with
different transmission power. Our experimental results in-
dicate that the RSS value is a linear function of the trans-
mission power for different antenna distance:
RSS(d) = rss0(d) + tx
where tx is the transmission power of the sender measured
in dBm and rss0(d) is the measured RSS value when the
sender uses the base transmission power tx = 0dBm. We
can use rss0(d) as a gain indicator of the antenna pair at
distance d.
Figure 5 plots the RSS values when packets are sent at
various transmission power for each antenna pair. The dis-
tance between the sender and receiver was ﬁxed at 10cm.
A very small distance tends to cause RSS values to saturate
when the transmission power increases, while a very large
distance could introduce more interference from the envi-
ronment, such as the multipath effect (Section 6.1.2). The
ﬁgure also shows that the gains of the four antennas pairs
are ordered as Type3 > Type1 > Type2 > Type4. This is
consistent with the order of P0 values measured in the ex-
periment in Section 4.2.
Based on Equation 3, the average RSS value should be a
logarithmic function of distance d between the sender and
receiver antennas as follows:
RSS = P0 − 10αlog10(
d
d0
)
(4)
where P0 is the RSS value at unit distance d0.
However, the Log-normal model usually applies when d
is much larger than the size of the antennas. In our scheme,
when the sender is very close to the receiver, d could be as
small as less than 1cm. So we wish to evaluate how well
Equation 4 approximates RSS values when d is small.
During the evaluation, we tried to rule out other factors
that may affect RSS. For instance, we always aligned the
sending and receiving antennas. We set the sender to use the
lowest transmission power tx = 1dBm and disabled the au-
tomatic rate adaptation feature. For antenna pairs 1, 2, and
4, we measured RSS values at various distances up to 10cm
to avoid the multipath effect. However, since antenna pair
3 has a much larger gain, their RSS is saturated when their
distance is smaller than 2cm, so we measured their RSS at
distances ranging from 2cm to 30cm. The result (Figure 4)
shows that the logarithmic relationship in Equation 4 still
approximates the measured RSS values vs distance where
the path loss exponent α falls in the range [1.057, 1.365].
P0 is related with the gain of each antennas pair. It is mea-
sured as -11.15, -19.71, -3.59, and -43.21 for antenna pairs
1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

RSS value and the sender-receiver distance

value and the transmission power
4.4 RSS saturation
Figure 5 shows that RSS on antenna pair 3 no longer in-
creases when the transmission power tx increases beyond 8.
This is due to RSS saturation described in Section 3.3.1. To
investigate how much RSS saturation can affect our scheme,
especially when the antenna distance d is small, we ob-
served the RSS− tx relationship by different d. Figure 6
demonstrates RSS saturation observed on antenna pair 2. It
indicates that RSS saturation occurs with smaller transmis-
sion power when the distance d decreases. For instance,
when the distance is 3cm, RSS saturates when tx > 13dBm.
But when the distance is reduced to 1cm, RSS saturates
when tx > 6dBm.
antenna. We conducted experiments using antenna pair 2
and 4. We set d to be 2cm and measured RSS at different x.

sender-receiver distance on antenna pair 2
4.5 Antenna alignment
Because our scheme prefers a high RSS ratio r when the
sender authenticates itself to the receiver, users are expected
to identify two spots where d1
is minimum, where d1 is
d2
the distance between the sender antenna and the nearer re-
ceiver antenna, and d2 is that between the sender antenna
and the farther receiver antenna. Assume the perpendicu-
lar distance from the antenna to the device surface is br and
bt for receiver and sender, respectively, the minimum d1 is
br + bt. We called the sender and the receiver are aligned
in this case. In reality, the user may not be able to align
the sender with the receiver perfectly. This misalignment
would adversely affect RSS because it increases the dis-
tance between the sending and receiving antennas and thus
decreases the RSS value. Let x be the distance between the
current location of the sender and its ideal aligned location
with the dominant antenna (the antenna on the receiver that
the sender should be aligned with). The theoretical RSS
value read from the dominant antenna should be:
RSS = P0 − 10αlog10
√d2 + x2
d0
We evaluated how much our scheme tolerates the mis-
alignment between the sender and the dominant receiving
Figure 7. The relation between the RSS value
and the offset
Figure 7 shows that RSS value is insensitive to misalign-
ment when the misalignment is small (< 1cm), but the ef-
fect becomes noticeable when the misalignment increases.
To avoid large misalignment, the devices could mark the lo-
cations of their antennas on their surfaces. Moreover, when
we select the thresholds rL and rH in the device pairing pro-
tocol in Section 3.2, we need to take into account how much
we tolerate antenna misalignment.
4.6 Distance between the receiving antennas
To take advantage of the antenna diversity, most laptops
have their antennas mounted on the corners of their LCD
frames or the two sides of their bodies. Therefore, the re-
ceiving antennas are usually more than 20cm away from
each other. However, handheld mobile devices are usually
smaller than 20cm. To investigate whether our scheme al-
lows handheld mobile devices with multiple antennas to be
used as receivers, we conducted the following experiment.
We used a Dell E5400 laptop connected with two external
antennas (Type 2) as the receiver. We chose an Openmoko
Freerunner smartphone as the sender and placed it only 1cm
away from one of the two external antennas on the receiver.
Similar to all the previous experiments, the sender phone
established an ad hoc connection with the receiver and con-
tinually sent ping packets with an interval of 10ms. The
transmission power was tuned in advance to avoid RSS sat-
uration. We measured the RSS ratios of 100 consecutive
packets when the sender was aligned with the left receiv-
ing antenna and right receiving antenna, respectively. We
repeated this measurement for different distances between
the two external antennas on the receiver: 10cm, 20cm, and
30cm. Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of
the RSS.
