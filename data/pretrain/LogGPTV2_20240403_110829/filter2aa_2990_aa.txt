Abstract. With the advent of paid DDoS protection in the forms of CleanPipe, 
CDN / Cloud or whatnot, the sitting ducks have stood up and donned armors... 
or so they think! We're here to rip apart this false sense of security by dissecting 
each and every mitigation techniques you can buy today, showing you in 
clinical details how exactly they work and how they can be defeated. 
Essentially we developed a 3-fold attack methodology: 
1. 
stay just below red-flag rate threshold, 
2. 
mask our attack traffics inconspicuous, 
3. 
emulate the behavior of a real networking stack with a human operator 
behind it in order to spoof the correct response to challenges, 
4. 
??? 
5. 
PROFIT! 
We will explain all the required look-innocent headers, TCP / HTTP challenge-
response handshakes,JS auth bypass, etc. etc. in meticulous details. With that 
knowledge you too can be a DDoS ninja! Our PoC attack tool "Kill-em-All" 
will then be introduced as a platform to put what you've learned into practice, 
empowering you to bypass all DDoS mitigation layers and get straight through 
to the backend where havoc could be wrought. Oh and for the skeptics among 
you, we'll be showing testing results against specific products and services.

Introduction 
DDoS attacks remain a major threat to internet security because they are relatively 
cheap yet highly effective in taking down otherwise well-protected networks. One 
need look no further than the attack on Spamhaus to realize the damage potential – 
bandwidth clog peaked at 300Gbps, all from a mere 750Mbps generated attack traffic 
[1]! 
In the following sections, we first examine DDoS attacks observed in the wild and 
commercially available mitigation techniques against those attacks, with brief

The crudest form of DDoS attack are volumetric DDoS attacks, whereby a huge 
volume of traffic pours into the victim in a brute-force manner, hogging all bandwidth 
otherwise available for legitimate purposes. Execution is expensive, as the attacker 
would have to send traffic whose volume is on par with the victim’s spare capacity. 
This translates to a higher monetary cost associated with hiring botnets. The age-old 
ping flood is a prime example. 
Semantic DDoS attacks work smarter, amplifying firepower by exploiting semantic 
contexts such as protocol and application weaknesses [3]. This effectively tips the 
balance in the attacker’s favor, making attacks much cheaper. Examples of semantic 
attacks include Slowloris [4] and Smurf [5] attacks, as well as application level 
attacks that make excessive database lookups in web applications. 
A third category, blended DDoS attacks, aims to achieve stealthy attacks through 
blending 
into 
legitimate 
traffic, 
practically 
rendering 
ineffective 
most 
countermeasures designed to filter out abnormal, presumably malicious, traffic. HOIC 
[6] is an example of an attack that employs blending techniques via randomized 
headers. 
Note that these categories are by no means mutually exclusive. For instance, 
blended attacks that also exploit application weaknesses are not at all uncommon in 
the wild. 
2.2 
DDoS Mitigation Techniques 
Mitigation are techniques used to reduce the impact of attacks on the network. The 
upcoming paragraphs [2] shall explain the three main types of mitigation such as 
traffic policing, black/white listing and proactive resource release as shown in Figure
