ABSTRACT
Website fingerprinting attacks on Tor pose an security issue in
anonymity privacy, in which attackers can identify websites visited
by victims through passively capturing and analyzing encrypted
packet traces. Although related works have been studied over a
long period, most of them focus on single-tab packet traces which
only contain one page tab’s data. However, users often open multi-
ple page tabs successively when browsing the web, and multi-tab
packet traces generated will corrupt common single-tab attacks.
Existing multi-tab attacks still depend on an elaborate feature en-
gineering, besides, they fail to exploit the overlapping area which
contains the mixed data of two adjacent page tabs, thus suffering
from the information lost or confusion. In this paper, we propose
a Block Attention Profiling Model named BAPM as a new multi-
tab attacking model. Specifically, BAPM fully utilizes the whole
multi-tab packet trace including the overlapping area to avoid infor-
mation lost. It generates a tab-aware representation from direction
sequences and performs the block division to separate mixed page
tabs as clearly as possible, thus relieving the information confusion.
Then the attention-based profiling is used to group blocks belonging
to the same page tab and finally multiple websites are simultane-
ously identified under a global view. We compare BAPM with state
of the art multi-tab attacks, and BAPM outperforms comparison
methods even with larger overlapping area. The effectiveness of

1 INTRODUCTION
Concerned about online privacy, Internet users tend to hide their
destination websites when browsing the web. For example, as the
most widely used anonymous network, the onion routing (Tor)
keeps users away from being spied through traffic encryption and
random multi-hop routing with volunteer proxy nodes around the
world [1, 7]. However, apart from explicit traffic content and IP
addresses, different websites will load unique web resources (e.g.,
pictures, videos, HTML scripts) when being visited, and some char-
acteristics will be reflected in the external shape of packet traces
[12]. Therefore, network administrators are able to identify which
websites had been visited by users in the network through ana-
lyzing captured packet traces. This security issue is called website
fingerprinting (WF) attacks [10].
WF attacks on Tor can be performed on three types of packet
traces: TLS packets, TCP packets and cells. Attacks on TLS or TCP
packets mainly depend on raw features manually constructed by
fine-grained feature engineering [4, 9, 12, 15, 16, 24, 25] such as
248ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA

data amount, packet timing, packet length and ordering informa-
tion. Cells are data transmission units of Tor and all cells have the
same length in order to avoid leaking packet length features of
specific websites. Therefore, WF attacks on cells actually analyze
their direction and deep learning techniques [2, 3, 18–20, 23] are
more often used to automatically learn latent features on direction
sequences. Both raw and latent features have been proved to be
effective, which demonstrates that limited external information can
also fingerprint websites.
Although WF attacks on Tor have achieved expected results, their
practical feasibility in real world is criticized [11, 26]. Traditional
WF attacks are performed on a well constructed dataset, in which
each packet trace is generated by visiting only one page tab at a time.
Thus attackers only need to analyze traces entirely belonging to a
specific website without any noise data, which is known as single-
tab assumption. This assumption makes WF attacks less difficult,
but it is obviously unreal: Users may do other things such as instant
messaging along with web browsing, and similar behavior is totally
random [26]. In addition, even if users only browse the web, they
may open a new page tab before the last one finishes loading which
is called multi-tab browsing behavior [6, 8, 11, 26, 29], for example,
jumping to another page through a hyperlink. According to [22],
about 78% of the browsing time has at least two parallel opening
page tabs for one user, so packet traces in real world inevitably
contain mixed data from multiple page tabs and greatly degrade
common single-tab WF attacks.
Figure 1: Three basic situations in two-tab packet traces
According to [26], multi-tab packet traces have three basic types:
apart, continuous and overlapping ones. Fig. 1 displays three situa-
tions of two-tab traces as an example. Apart and continuous traces
are easier to process since data of each page tab is independent,
while overlapping traces are much more complicated and become
a critical issue in multi-tab WF attacks. It is almost impossible to
accurately separate two overlapping page tabs mixed in one trace,
changeable overlapping area size and page number also bring much
uncertainty. In this paper, we focus on the multi-tab WF attacks for
overlapping traces like Fig. 1(c) of Tor.
Multi-tab WF attacks are put forward in recent years [6, 8, 26,
29, 30] to relax the single-tab assumption, among them attacks
on overlapping traces include two types: (1) One type ignores the
overlapping area. It is performed in two steps which determines
the range of overlapping area and drops it in advance, then exploits
remaining part of traces with only one page tab’s data. (2) An-
other type utilizes the whole multi-tab trace including overlapping
and non-overlapping area. Except for cited works, we also regard
the multi-label classification in machine learning as an attacking
method of this type, since it can learn multiple labels directly from
one sample. All single-tab WF attacks can be customized for multi-
tab scenarios using multi-label classification theoretically, although
it has not been implemented in any related works. These two meth-
ods have gained important achievements, but there are still some
remaining problems to be solved:
• Expensive manual cost. Existing multi-tab WF attacks all
depend on a fine-grained feature engineering. A well de-
signed feature set often requires attackers to put in a lot of
effort. Besides, methods ignoring the overlapping area even
need to extract features two times for splitting point and
non-overlapping area respectively.
• Insufficient overlapping area exploiting. Both two types
of multi-tab WF attacks have their own problem facing the
overlapping area: (1) Information lost. Given that multi-tab
traces in real world can have a large overlapping area, simply
discarding this area will ignore much useful information and
thus restricted by a limited view. (2) Information confusion.
Since the overlapping area is mixed by many discontinuous
parts of two or more pages, directly taking the overlapping
area into consideration without distinguishing different parts
within it can result in a worse effect.
In this paper, we propose a Block Attention Profiling Model
BAPM as a multi-tab WF attack based on deep learning. BAPM
leverages the CNN to generate a tab-aware representation on the
whole packet trace including overlapping area, and splits the repre-
sentation into blocks to reduce the influence of mixed data. A series
of attention scores are then calculated on blocks according to block
relations, therefore blocks of the same website are grouped as an
integral part to mutually make a contribution on the corresponding
website identification. As a result, BAPM preserves the overlapping
area and well exploits it rather than being confused. Through this
work, we reveal potential privacy threats of multi-tab WF attacks.
Main contributions of this paper are listed below:
• BAPM is the first end-to-end model for multi-tab WF attacks:
(1) It generates the tab-aware representations without feature
engineering. (2) It performs the attack on the whole multi-tab
packet trace to avoid information lost.
• We relieve the information confusion by designing a block
division on tab-aware representations. We try to ensure that
the trace part of each block only represents one website, thus
blocks will not be confused by mix data.
• We import multi-head attention to group blocks which have
stronger relations. Block groups provide us a global view to
adaptively profile multi-tab traces: blocks in this group will
be all focused when identifying the corresponding website,
no matter where is it located in the original trace.
• We compare BAPM with three multi-tab WF attacks on pub-
lic and self-built dataset, results show that BAPM has the
best and most stable performance. Effectiveness of BAPM
components is also validated.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We summarize
related single-tab and multi-tab WF attacks in section 2 and de-
scribe the threat model in section 3. BAPM is proposed with three
modules in section 4. We introduce the dataset, experiment settings
and design in section 5. Section 6 analyzes experiment results and
section 7 discusses model performance in real world. We conclude
this paper and provide possible future works in section 8.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Single-tab WF Attacks
Traditional WF attacks are based on the single-tab assumption,
including attacks on non-Tor and Tor scenarios.
Attacks on non-Tor: Single-tab WF attacks are firstly proposed
by Hintz [10], he determined if the user is visiting certain websites
through data amount in bytes received on specific ports. Since then,
similar methods are widely applied in encrypted traffic analysis.
Liberatore et al. used the direction and size of packets to profile
websites behind OpenSSH and identify them based on these profiles
[13]. Lu et al. exploited packet ordering information along with
packet lengths of websites on both SSH and SSL tunnels [14].
Attacks on Tor: In 2011, Panchenko et al. successfully per-
formed WF attack on Tor for the first time [16], showing that the
onion routing based system is not as strong as expected. WF attacks
on Tor at early stage are mainly machine learning models like KNN
[24], random forest [9], SVM [25] and improved SVM [4, 15]. Fea-
tures extracted for attacking also have a rich variety: Panchenko et
al. generated a more efficient cumulative representation of packets
ordering and bursts [15], Li et al. discussed in detail how different
feature sets leak website information [12].
Deep learning based methods are firstly used on Tor by Abe [2],
he adopted stacked auto-encoders and results on simple direction
sequences are comparable to feature based methods. Afterwards,
results of deep learning models keep getting better and better with
more complex structures. Rimmer et al. proved that deep learning
approaches are more robust against website content changes, show-
ing the feasibility of automated feature learning [18]. Sirinam et al.
proposed an elaborate CNN structure called Deep Fingerprinting
(DF) [19]. DF expanded the operations in one basic convolutional
block and repeated it four times, attaining 98.3% accuracy on close
world. Bhat et al. presented Var-CNN with semi-automated featrue
extraction [3] and achieved better results under small amounts of
training data.
2.2 Multi-tab WF Attacks
Multi-tab WF attacks have also been performed on both non-Tor
and Tor traffic with different ways.
Attacks on non-Tor: Naive bayes classifier [8], hidden markov
model [30] and recurrent neural network [17] are used to attack
multi-tab browsing behavior based on specific protocol features.
For example, [8] gets the TCP connection number as the key infor-
mation by counting the open channel message of SSH, while [17]
depends on the server name field of TLS client hello messages.
Attacks on Tor: Multi-tab WF attacks on Tor are considered
in practice by Juarez et al. for the first time [11], and the accuracy
dropped significantly. In 2016, Wang et al. analyzed all three multi-
tab conditions. They handled the apart and continuous packet traces
well through time-based and classification-based splitting, but failed
with overlapping ones.
Page splitting [29] and page sectioning [6] WF attacks (denoted
as PSP-WF and PSE-WF) are two latest works on overlapping traces.
They represent two types of multi-tab WF attacks introduced above.
PSP-WF firstly finds and removes the overlapping area by pin-
pointing the boundary packet of it called splitting point. Since an
overlapping trace has only two splitting points (at the begin and
end of overlapping area) but much more other packets, [29] handles
the imbalance through a balance-cascade classifier to selectively
drop normal packets during the model training iterations. Once
the splitting point is pinpointed, the part of trace before the first
point and after the second point would be input to a random forest
classifier to get corresponding website label. PSP-WF involves two
classification tasks but can only classify the first page [29]. Besides,
attackers need to record the splitting point location when building
the training set.
PSE-WF do not particularly single the overlapping area out. It
divides the entire trace into several sections which have the same
packet number or time length, and represent each section with
CUMUL features [15]. The model training and testing are all based
on the section as a unit: sections of single-tab traces are used to
train a K-NN classifier, while sections of multi-tab traces are used
to test and predict each section label. Finally the trace label will
be determined by the majority voting results of all section labels.
However, testing sections in overlapping area are more likely to be
wrongly classified and negatively affect the voting results instead
of providing valid information in overlapping area, thus PSE-WF
requires a limited overlapping size in particular [6].
Same as PSP-WF and PSE-WF, BAPM is a multi-tab WF attack on
overlapping traces of Tor, more details about comparison between
these two works and BAPM are displayed in Table 1.
3 THREAT MODEL
Model assumption: A critical step in WF attacks is how to capture
victims’ packet traces for prediction. There are two types of attack-
ers who have access to raw packet traces: observers and forwarders.
Observers monitor all packets received or sent by a network such
as Internet service provider on the backbone network. Forwarders
have a stronger capability which can communicate with users like
a proxy node, but it is obviously harder to act as a malicious mid-
dleman than only monitoring from a third-person perspective. For
example, observers in Tor only see encrypted packet traces with no
extra information, but forwarders can negotiate with users to estab-
lish a anonymous circuit to transmit data. During the transmission,
forwarders can obtain cell logs of all packets going through their
node by modifying the protocol source code. Since each session has
a unique circuit identifier which is recorded in cell log, forwarders
can separate overlapping traces by checking the circuit identifier.
So multi-tab browsing behavior makes no difference for forwarders
actually, and multi-tab WF techniques discussed here is designed
for observers rather than forwarders.
There are also some other mutual constrictions in multi-tab WF
attacks. Firstly, background noise is not considered, all packet traces
are only generated by the web browsing. In addition, each website
is represented by its home page, thus the website classification
actually refers to classifying web pages instead of the website family
with a series of sub-pages. Note that these constrictions are also
followed by other multi-tab WF attacks, so the capabilities of our
model are not extra enhanced.
Model overview: A typical case of multi-tab WF attacks is shown
as Fig. 2. Similar to single-tab attacks, attackers maintain a list of
websites they are interested to monitor, and visit these websites
by themselves to collect enough packet traces for each website.
