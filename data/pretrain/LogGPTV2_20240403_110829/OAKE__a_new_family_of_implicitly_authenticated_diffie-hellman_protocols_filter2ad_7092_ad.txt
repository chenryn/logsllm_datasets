Table 1: A brief comparison between (s; r)OAKE and HMQV
A brief comparison between (s,r)OAKE and HMQV is summarized in Table 1 (page 11). In Table 1,
tse stands for the time for performing one simultaneous exponentiations, te the time for performing one
∗
q , th the time for performing
modular exponentiation, tm the time for one modular multiplication over Z
∗
q . For total eﬃciency,
one hashing operation, ta the time for performing one modular addition over Z
we only count the operations needed to compute the values K ^A = K ^B, as all other operations are the
same for (s,r)OAKE and (H)MQV. For online eﬃciency, we only count the dominant operations for
online computation parts of K ^A = K ^B (while ignoring the non-dominant operations like tm, ta and
th for presentation simplicity). By “parallel subgroup test with pre-computation”, we mean that for
(s,r)OAKE in case Af b+cy is pre-computed, we can compute X db+ey and X q in parallel that amounts
for about 1.2 exponentiations; (H)MQV does not support such a parallel operation. “Robust embedded
subgroup test” means the more robust Case-1 subgroup test speciﬁed in Section 3 (page 6). The last
item refers to the need to change the functions c; d; e; HK or parameter l in order to resist birthday-type
11
collision attacks on h, in case pre-computed DH-components are exposed prior to the sessions involving
them and the number of sessions is large in the system. For example, suppose |q| = 160, we may hope
the probability that collisions occur (by birthday attacks) should be at most 2
−80 in such cases.
Finally, we end this work with some questions for future investigations:
• The design of (s,r)OAKE is based on the building tool of NMJPOK formulated in this work. An
interesting direction is to develop (interactive) NMJPOK in the standard model, or non-interactive
NMJPOK even in the random oracle model, and ﬁnd their more applications.
• In this work, we mainly analyzed the security of (s,r)OAKE in the basic CK-framework. Another
direction is to analyze the (s,r)OAKE in some more variants of the CK-framework introduced in
recent years.
• For rOAKE, being merely based on the GDH assumption is achieved at the cost of losing reasonable
deniability (and more restricted secrecy exposure). It is interesting to investigate the possibility of
achieving provably-secure and reasonably deniable IA-DHKE merely based the GDH assumption
(or other standard assumptions).
• We introduced the concept of session-key computational fairness, which can be viewed as a ﬁrst
step toward a formal treatment of computational fairness for cryptographic protocols. An inter-
esting question is to achieve computationally-fair key-exchange protocols in the standard model,
and to formulate and achieve more computationally-fair cryptographic protocols.
