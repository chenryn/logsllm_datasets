still orients its focus on Bitcoin. Many scholars use GARCH
models to ﬁt the time series of Bitcoin price. Among them,
Dyhrberg et al. [13] explore the ﬁnancial asset capabilities
of Bitcoin and suggests categorizing Bitcoin as something
between gold and US Dollar on a spectrum from pure medium
of exchange to pure store of value; Bouoiyour et al. [7] argue
that Bitcoin is still immature and remains reactive to nega-
tive rather than positive news at the time of their writing; 2
years later, Conrad et al. [10] present the opposite ﬁnding
that negative press does not explain the volatility of Bitcoin;
Dyhrberg [14] demonstrates that bitcoin can be used to hedge
against stocks; Katsiampa [21] emphasizes modelling accu-
racy and recommends the AR-CGARCH model for price
retro-ﬁtting. Bariviera et al. [4] compute the Hurst exponent
by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method and
conclude that the market liquidity does not affect the level of
long-range dependence. Corbet et al. [11] demonstrate that
Bitcoin shows characteristics of an speculative asset rather
than a currency also with the presence of futures trading in
Bitcoin.
Among the few research studies that also look into the ﬁnan-
cial characteristics of other cryptocurrencies, Fry et al. [16]

show that with fairly rudimentary machine learning models,
one can accurately predict pump-and-dump target coins in
the crypto-market. As such, we hope our research could, on
one hand, lead to fewer people falling victim to market ma-
nipulation and more people trading strategically, and on the
other hand, urge the adoption of new technology for regu-
lators to detect market abuse and criminal behavior. If such
advice would be heeded, admins’ schemes would crumble,
which would in turn lead to a healthier trading environment,
accelerating the market towards a fairer and more efﬁcient
equilibrium.

Baur et al. [6] investigate asymmetric volatility effects of
large cryptocurrencies and discover that in the crypto market
positive shocks increase the volatility more than negative ones.
Jahani et al. [19] assess whether and when the discussions
of cryptocurrencies are truth-seeking or hype-based, and dis-
cover a negative correlation between the quality of discussion
and price volatility of the coin.
7 Conclusions
This paper presents a detailed study of pump-and-dump
schemes in the cryptocurrency space. We start by present-
ing the anatomy of a typical attack and then investigate a
variety of aspects of real attacks on crypto-coins over the last
eight months on four crypo-exchanges. The study demon-
strates the persisting nature of pump-and-dump activities in
the crypto-market that are the driving force behind tens of
millions of dollars of phony trading volumes each month. The
study reveals that pump-and-dump organizers can easily use
their insider information to proﬁt from a pump-and-dump
event at the sacriﬁce of fellow pumpers.
Through market investigation, we further discover that mar-
ket movements prior to a pump-and-dump event frequently
contain information on witch coin will be pumped. Using
LASSO regularized GML and balanced random forests, we
build various models that are predicated on the time and venue
(exchange) of a pump-and-dump broadcast in a Telegram
group. Multiple models display high performance across all
subsamples, implying that pumped coins can be predicted
based on market information. We further propose a simple
but effective trading strategy that can be used in combination
with the prediction models. Out-of-sample tests show that a
return of as high as 60% over two and half months can be
consistently exploited even under conservative assumptions.
In sum, we wish to raise the awareness of pump-and-dump
schemes permeating the crypto-market through our study. We
