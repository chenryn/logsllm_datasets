Why can't/shouldn't the main editor body get the theme name appended to it as
a class? That way I can add my own changes to a theme in my styles.less file
and have it only apply to that theme. If I change my theme, those changes
might not make sense or even break other things in the new theme.  
#701 was what I found when I searched but it didn't really seem to have a good
reason for closing it.
