**Ansible Version:** 2.0, 2.0.0.2  
**Module:** File  
**Description:**

When attempting to create directories with a depth of more than one level using the `file` module, the following error is encountered:

```
There was an issue creating /dir1/dir2 as requested: 'module' object has no attribute 'EEXISTS'
```

The command works correctly if only the first-level directory (i.e., `/dir1`) is created. This functionality worked as expected in Ansible version 1.9.2.
