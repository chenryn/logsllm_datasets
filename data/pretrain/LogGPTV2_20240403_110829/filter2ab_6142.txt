### Title: Black Hat EU-22: Back-Connect to the Connected Car â€“ Identifying Vulnerabilities in Volkswagen Electric Vehicles

The attack surface of modern connected cars is extensive, encompassing a wide range of technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication, 2G/3G/4G cellular networks, custom RF (Radio Frequency) protocols, CAN (Controller Area Network), OBD2 (On-Board Diagnostics) interfaces, automotive Ethernet, USB ports, remote diagnostics, telematics, and mobile applications. In this presentation, we will share the findings from our penetration testing of the modern European electric Volkswagen ID.3 model. The vulnerabilities and security issues we uncovered are also relevant to other Volkswagen models, including the ID.4 and ID.5, affecting hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles on the road.

We will demonstrate how hackers can gain root access to the Infotainment and Gateway modules, install backdoors, and perform various malicious actions remotely. Specifically, we will show:

1. **Root Access and Backdoor Installation**: How attackers can obtain root access in the Infotainment and Gateway modules and install backdoors.
2. **Digital Signature Bypass**: Techniques for bypassing digital signatures during software update procedures in Automotive Grade Linux.
3. **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Exploitation of an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the network service of the QNX7 system.
4. **Key Extraction**: Methods for extracting keys from trusted zones within the Gateway.
5. **Remote Control via Wi-Fi**: Use of Wi-Fi to remotely control installed backdoors.

These demonstrations will highlight the critical security risks associated with modern connected vehicles and emphasize the need for robust security measures to protect against potential threats.
