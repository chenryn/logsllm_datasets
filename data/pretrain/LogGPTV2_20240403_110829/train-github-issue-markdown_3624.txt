# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
Enable support for command line arguments in Power Toys Run commands.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
### Example:
- **Command Input:** `notepad "C:\example\file.txt"`
- **Behavior:**
  1. Power Toys Run will locate the program (in this case, `notepad`) from the system's PATH.
  2. It will then pass the provided arguments (e.g., `"C:\example\file.txt"`) to the identified command.

This enhancement will allow users to execute programs with specific arguments directly from the Power Toys Run interface, improving functionality and user experience.
