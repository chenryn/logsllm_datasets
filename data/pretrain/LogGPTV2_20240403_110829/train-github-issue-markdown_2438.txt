**Comparison of Subdivision Level 1 on Textured Mesh in jthree and Blender**

The following images illustrate the results of applying a subdivision level of 1 to a textured mesh using different settings and software.

### jthree
- **Subdivision Level 1, No UV Subdivision**
  - **Result:** The seams in the texture are highly visible and unappealing.

  - **Note:** I also attempted to use the "repeat" image mode as suggested by "bai" from IRC, but it did not improve the seam issue.

### Blender
- **Subdivision Level 1, UV Subdivision Off**
  - **Result:** The texture seams are significantly less noticeable, resulting in a much better visual quality.

- **Subdivision Level 1, UV Subdivision On**
  - **Result:** While there is some improvement, it is not as significant as turning off UV subdivision. However, this feature can be useful in certain scenarios.
