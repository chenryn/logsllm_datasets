This is the result of using subdiv level 1 on a textured mesh in jthree

As you can see the seams are terrible. Also tried using image mode repeat as a
sugestion by "bai" from IRC but that didn't make a change
This is the same model in blender, subdiv level 1, UV subdivision turned off

Much better! Now again but with UV subdivision turned on

Not a giant improvement but this feature can be very useful sometimes
