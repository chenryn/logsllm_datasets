 **Current Situation**  
When a user is initiating multiple file copying/moving operations at the same
time or in a short time frame, Windows Explorer adds all those operations to
the copying/moving queue and works on them at the same time, i.e. all those
copying/moving operations run parallel. This slows down the process and
Windows a lot because the source and target drives and the CPU are stressed
more.
**Feature request**  
When adding multiple file copying/moving operations to the copying/moving
queue, only one operation (i.e. the first in the queue) should run, all the
additional operations should be put on hold and started automatically when
they move into the first position in the queue.  
There should also be a user customizable size threshold setting so that
copying/moving operations with small(er) amounts of data can still run
parallel, even though they are not first in queue.
**Benefits**
  * faster file transfer speed
  * Windows operating system and Explorer run more responsive during file copy/move operations
  * less heat development of the drives
  * less noise development of the drives
  * possibly longer battery life (when on a laptop)
