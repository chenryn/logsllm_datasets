## Abstract

We investigated the impact of Patch Tuesday on the volume and characteristics of malicious and unwanted traffic observed by a large IPv4 (/8) darkspace monitor over the first six months of 2012. Our analysis did not reveal significant changes in overall traffic volume following Patch Tuesday. However, we observed a consistent increase in the number of active hosts sending traffic to our darkspace monitor on the day after Patch Tuesday (Exploit Wednesday) for all six months. These preliminary findings suggest that the effects of Patch Tuesday warrant further investigation. Identifying time intervals when new sources become active can help refine sampling methods to focus on periods likely to contain more valuable information, such as new malicious sources.

### Introduction

Microsoft releases accumulated security patches on the second Tuesday of each month, known as "Patch Tuesday" (PT). Attackers can exploit this information to target unpatched machines or to check if previously exploited vulnerabilities remain open. Launching new malware immediately after Patch Tuesday maximizes the potential lifetime of an exploit before a patch is deployed.

### Methodology

We analyzed the traffic observed by a large IPv4 (/8) darkspace monitor [1] over the first six months of 2012. We used tools such as corsaro [5], MATLAB, and Wireshark to analyze packet counts, unique source addresses, top destination ports, and packet content. The IATmon tool [3] was employed to classify IP source hosts into 18 mutually exclusive source types based on protocol and temporal patterns over a one-hour interval.

### Results

#### Overall Traffic Analysis

Initially, we analyzed the overall traffic without distinguishing among source types. The total packet count did not show any unusual behavior around Patch Tuesday. However, the number of unique source IP addresses revealed a consistent pattern across all six months. Specifically, there was a significant increase in the number of active sources immediately after midnight following Patch Tuesday, which typically remained elevated above the baseline for several hours (Figure 1).

Each month exhibits a significant increase in the number of unique source IPs shortly after PT. January and March have additional peaks many days later, which are truncated in the graph.*

#### Source Type Analysis

The IATmon source type analysis indicated that the increase in active sources after Patch Tuesday was primarily due to sources classified as '1 or 2 packets' (sources sending fewer than 3 packets) and 'UDP unknown' (UDP sources sending more than 2 packets to multiple destinations and ports). In some months, other source types also showed significant increases on Exploit Wednesday, such as UDP probes in February and May, UDP vertical scans in July, and µTorrent sources in April. However, only 'UDP unknown' and '1 or 2 packets' sources consistently increased on Exploit Wednesday across all six months.

#### Packet Count Analysis

Our analysis of the packet count per source type revealed a few potential Patch Tuesday effects. For example, we observed an increase in UDP horizontal scans on Exploit Wednesday in June and an increase in packets from 'TCP and UDP' sources in July. The packet count for '1 or 2 packets' sources increased in all six months on Exploit Wednesday, but this was a direct effect of the increased number of sources of this type.

#### Specific Observations

- **TCP Horizontal Scans**: 32% (in June) to 56% (in March) of all darkspace packets originated from sources performing TCP horizontal scans to port 445, a behavior that has been common since the Conficker outbreak [2].
- **TCP Backscatter**: Between 13% (in January) and 42% (in April) of all observed packets were TCP backscatter (TCP-ACK, TCP-RST).
- **DNS Backscatter**: In January 2012, there was a significant reduction in DNS backscatter traffic immediately after Patch Tuesday. A DNS name server that had been sending 4 to 6.5 million DNS backscatter packets per hour stopped within two hours after Patch Tuesday. These packets were standard DNS query responses with format errors, sent in response to requests for a porn web page. We hypothesize that the queries to the name server were sent with spoofed source addresses, and the sudden drop in backscatter may be due to a patch preventing compromised hosts in a botnet from participating in a DDoS attack.

### Destination Port Analysis

To determine if the sources causing the peaks in the overall source count were targeting specific vulnerabilities, we analyzed the destination ports for all packets from 'UDP unknown' sources and '1 or 2 packets' sources that sent only UDP packets. We calculated the median number of sources per destination port over the entire month as a baseline. On Exploit Wednesday, we observed a broad distribution of destination ports, with no ports showing an especially high number of sources across all six months. An examination of the payload for some of the UDP packets sent to the top ten ports did not reveal any new or surprising patterns; the packets appeared similar to those seen at other times.

### Conclusion

Although our analysis is based on a limited dataset, our preliminary results indicate that the effects of Patch Tuesday merit further investigation. Ideally, this should include multiple sources of darknet data and data from networks with active hosts. Longitudinal trends of malicious behavior related to Patch Tuesday can provide quantitative assessments of the health of one component of the Internet. Information about source activity patterns can also help optimize measurement methods, such as tuning sampling techniques toward time periods with high source activities.

The data used in this analysis is available at [4].
