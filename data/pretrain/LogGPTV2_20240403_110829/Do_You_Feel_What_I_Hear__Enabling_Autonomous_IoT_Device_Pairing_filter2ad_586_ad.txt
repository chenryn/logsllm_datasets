Fig. 11: We study the ROC of LDs and Ms for accuracy of event detection. Across all events, the LDs have a high
detection rate while the Ms (even the higher-quality microphone and accelerometer) hardly perform better than a random
guess. (Note: For each event type, we only show sensors whose modalities have the ability to detect that event. For example,
the accelerometers cannot detect the coffee machine, hence are ignored in (c) and (f)).
B. Event Detection
1) Detection Abilities of Legitimate and Attacker Devices:
We now evaluate the performance of each sensor in dis-
tinguishing event signals from ambient noise. Recall from
Section VI-A the three variables of interest are a lower-bound
threshold T hrlower to separate the signal from noise; an
upper-bound threshold T hrupper to discard distinct signals
with high amplitude to thwart Shamming–Eavesdropping
attacks; and the weight α used in the exponential moving
average. In this experiment, we vary T hrlower, which is
important in signal detection, while ﬁxing T hrupper and α
to empirically optimized values.
We illustrate the study setup in Figure 10(a). The exper-
iment is conducted in a squash court wherein the LDs are
arranged with the geophone on the ﬂoor, the microphone on
a table, the accelerometer on the door, the motion detector
aimed at
the center of the room, and the power meter
supporting a single serving coffee machine (Nespresso Pixie
Carmine [54]). The Ms deployed just outside the room (as
illustrated in Figure 10(a)) include the accelerometer, the
higher-quality accelerometer and the geophone attached to
the outside of one of the walls of the squash court and
the microphone and higher-quality microphone placed on the
ground adjacent.
We have ten human subjects perform the following tasks:

knock on the door hosting the accelerometer, walk across
the court (across the motion detector and the geophone) and
around the table, brew coffee from the espresso machine on
the table two times, one after another, walk back across the
court, and knock on the door again before exiting. Hence,
participants performed each activity of knock, walk and
coffee twice per trial over ten different trials, providing a
total of 600 activity traces. To evaluate sensor accuracy in
event detection, we present Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) curves for each sensor used in this setup. The ROC
curves plot
false
positive rate (F Prate) and depict the ability of the different
sensor modalities to detect events at varying threshold levels
of signal amplitude.
the true positive rate (T Prate) against
Figure 11 depicts the resulting ROCs by event
type.
For each event, we depict the ROC of only those sensors
whose modalities would allow them to possibly detect it.
For example, a motion detector cannot detect a coffee event,
and hence is ommitted from the coffee ROC. We ﬁnd that
all legitimate sensors have a high signal detection accuracy
as most T hrlower yield a high T Prate with relatively low
F Prate. For example, knock ROC depicts good detection
abilities for the inside geophone, microphone, and accelerom-
eter, yielding large area under the curve (AUC), while the
motion detector and power meter do not produce any signal
for this event as expected (hence not shown). On the other
hand, ROC curves for the Ms show relatively poor detection
ability. We note that while all
three events indicate that
the higher quality attacker accelerometer and microphone
generally perform better than their lower-quality counterparts,
they are nevertheless unable to generate high T Prate without
generating equally high F Prate. At best, their curves follow
a random guess trend. Some of the ROCs, especially for
the attacker, appear to be increasing in a piecewise step
fashion rather than a smooth concave trend. This is due to the
nature of ambient noise in the system. As the signal detection
threshold is lowered, noise is detected as true positive until
the threshold is lowered enough such that other (lower)
ambient noise is detected as false positives.
2) Effect of Floor Types and Distances: We next study
the effect of the ﬂoor type on the detection accuracy of
LDs vs. Ms. We vary the ﬂoor type between wood and
carpet (most common variations found in homes) as de-
picted in Figure 10(b). For each ﬂoor type, we trigger two
events sufﬁciently spaced apart with no overlap in signal
detection: a coffee maker brewing (the same machine used
from Section VII-B1) and a blender (Cuisinart SPB-650 [14])
grinding. Since the accelerometer and motion detector cannot
detect either, and the ﬂoor type does not affect the power
meter, we study the sensing accuracy of the legitimate and
attacker geophones and microphones. For each event type,
the distance between the attacker/legitimate nodes and the
event source (coffee maker/blender) is varied from 1-6m.
We show the resulting area under the ROC curve (AUC) for
each sensor in Figure 12. Since the ambient noise inside the
room is low (as is typical in homes), the legitimate geophone
and microphone detect both the coffee and blender events

Fig. 12: As the distance between sensor devices and event
source varies from 1-6m, the LDs are consistently able to
detect the event (with high AUC) while the Ms have a
detection rate ﬂuctuating around a random guess for carpet
and wood alike. Since the blender is signiﬁcantly louder with
higher vibration than coffee brewing, the attacker’s AUC is
correspondingly higher.
with high accuracy for both ﬂoor types and across distances.
The latter occurs due to the high signal to noise ratio inside
the room even at longer distances from event source. On the
other hand, the attacker’s AUC ﬂuctuates around 50% for
carpet and wood alike across all distances for coffee events.
Essentially, the attacker outside is contending with ﬂuctuating
noise levels due to the noisy surrounding, and is unable to
detect these signals with accuracy any better than a random
guess. For the blender event, the attacker geophone does
show a slightly higher AUC, indicating better than random
guess. This is as expected with the consistently higher sound
and vibration caused by the blender as compared to the coffee
