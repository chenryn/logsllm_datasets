- **(f) Attacker Devices – Coffee**

**Description:**
We analyze the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the accuracy of event detection by legitimate devices (LDs) and attacker devices (Ms). The ROC curves plot the true positive rate (TP rate) against the false positive rate (FP rate) at varying threshold levels of signal amplitude.

**Key Findings:**
- **Legitimate Devices (LDs):** Across all events, LDs show a high detection rate with relatively low FP rates. For example, the geophone, microphone, and accelerometer inside the room demonstrate good detection abilities for knock, walk, and coffee events, as indicated by large areas under the curve (AUC).
- **Attacker Devices (Ms):** The Ms, even those with higher-quality microphones and accelerometers, perform poorly, often no better than a random guess. The ROC curves for the Ms exhibit a piecewise step increase rather than a smooth concave trend, which is attributed to the nature of ambient noise in the system.

**Note:** Only sensors capable of detecting specific events are included in the respective ROC curves. For instance, accelerometers and motion detectors are not shown for coffee events because they cannot detect such events.

#### B. Event Detection

**1. Detection Abilities of Legitimate and Attacker Devices:**

**Experiment Setup:**
- **Location:** Squash court
- **Sensors:**
  - **Legitimate Devices (LDs):** Geophone on the floor, microphone on a table, accelerometer on the door, motion detector aimed at the center of the room, power meter supporting a Nespresso Pixie Carmine coffee machine.
  - **Attacker Devices (Ms):** Accelerometer, higher-quality accelerometer, and geophone attached to the outside of one of the walls, microphone and higher-quality microphone placed on the ground adjacent to the room.

**Tasks Performed:**
- Ten human subjects performed the following tasks:
  - Knock on the door hosting the accelerometer.
  - Walk across the court (across the motion detector and the geophone) and around the table.
  - Brew coffee from the espresso machine on the table twice, one after another.
  - Walk back across the court.
  - Knock on the door again before exiting.

**Data Collection:**
- Each activity (knock, walk, coffee) was performed twice per trial over ten different trials, providing a total of 600 activity traces.

**Results:**
- **Legitimate Devices (LDs):** Showed high signal detection accuracy with most lower-bound thresholds (T_hrlower) yielding high TP rates and relatively low FP rates.
- **Attacker Devices (Ms):** Demonstrated poor detection ability, with higher-quality sensors performing only slightly better than their lower-quality counterparts but still unable to achieve high TP rates without generating equally high FP rates.

**2. Effect of Floor Types and Distances:**

**Experiment Setup:**
- **Floor Types:** Wood and carpet (common variations found in homes)
- **Events:** Coffee maker brewing (Nespresso Pixie Carmine) and blender grinding (Cuisinart SPB-650)
- **Sensors Studied:** Geophones and microphones (accelerometer and motion detector excluded due to their inability to detect these events; power meter unaffected by floor type)

**Distance Variation:**
- Distance between the attacker/legitimate nodes and the event source varied from 1-6 meters.

**Results:**
- **Legitimate Devices (LDs):** Consistently detected both coffee and blender events with high accuracy across all distances and floor types, attributed to the high signal-to-noise ratio inside the room.
- **Attacker Devices (Ms):** Showed fluctuating detection rates around 50% for both carpet and wood floors across all distances for coffee events. For the blender event, the attacker geophone showed a slightly higher AUC, indicating better-than-random performance, likely due to the consistently higher sound and vibration levels.

**Conclusion:**
- LDs consistently outperform Ms in event detection, with LDs achieving high detection accuracy and low FP rates, while Ms struggle with ambient noise and generally perform no better than a random guess.
