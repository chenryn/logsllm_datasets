User: I have the following set-up

A Python script
A Mac OSX Automator application with said script
An iCal alert that runs the Automator (and thus the Python script) on a regular schedule

All of the above works just fine. But I need to make a change. I need the script to check a web site for a time in the future (that same day) and then come back prior to that time and run itself again. I know how to do the first part (get the time) but I have no clue how to do the second part. How do you get a Python script to (1) run itself at a regular time and then (2) run again at some point in the future? The point in the future will change on a regular basis. Sometimes it would be as early as 10AM, other times it may be 7PM. 
Any thoughts on this and pseudo-code are welcome. Thanks!
Assistant: Set a variable to the future time, and check it in a while() loop
