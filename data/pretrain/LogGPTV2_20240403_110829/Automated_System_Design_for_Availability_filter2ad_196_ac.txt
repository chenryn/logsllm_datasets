This formula can be obtained using a formal analytical
derivation, but we provide a simple interpretation here. Pf
is the probability that there is at least one failure during an
interval of duration lw. The ratio (1 − Pf )/Pf is the aver-
age ratio of the number of intervals of duration lw that do
not experience failures to the number of intervals that do ex-
perience failures. In an interval of duration MTBF, there is
only one failure on average. Thus, there are approximately
(1 − Pf )/Pf intervals of duration lw that do not experi-
ence failures for each MTBF interval (ignoring intervals with
multiple failures). Since Tlw is deﬁned as the mean time re-
quired to execute lw time units of useful work, there should
be (1 − Pf )/Pf intervals of duration Tlw in an MTBF inter-
val as indicated by the equation above.
With this equation we can compute the fraction of the com-
putation time that is used for useful work as lw/Tlw. Given
the uptime Tup computed by the availability model engine,
we can compute the effective uptime that the system is ex-
ecuting useful work as Tef = Tup ∗ (lw/Tlw). We can then
easily compute the expected job execution time using the per-
formance model of the application and the job size.
