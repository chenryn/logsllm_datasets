and open questions inspire further work from theoreticians and
practitioners to help break the impasse in data sharing.
Data/code release and Ethics: While we highlight privacy con-
cerns in using GAN-based models, the code/data we are releasing
does not raise any ethical issues as the public datasets do not contain
any personal information.
