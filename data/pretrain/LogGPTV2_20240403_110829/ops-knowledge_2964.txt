User: I installed Anaconda a while ago but recently decided to uninstall it and just install basic python 2.7.
I removed Anaconda and deleted all the directories and installed python 2.7.
But when I go to install PyGTK for Windows it says it will install it to the c:/users/.../Anaconda directory - this doesn't even exist. I want to install it to the c:/python-2.7 directory. Why does it think Anaconda is still installed? And how can I change this?
Assistant: there is a start item folder in C:\ drive. Remove ur anaconda3 folder there, simple and you are good to go. In my case I found here "C:\Users\pravu\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
