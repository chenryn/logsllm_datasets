User: Python 2.5 came installed on my Mac. I downloaded Python 3.2 and have it running in my IDE.  When I open the terminal in Mac and type in Python, it tells me I'm working with 2.5.
1) What do I enter in the command line to change from 2.5 to 3.2? 
2) Once I get to 3.2 (using your answer), how do I get back to 2.5 if I want to?
Thanks for your help.
Assistant: You can simply type python3.2 instead of just python to use python 3.2.
