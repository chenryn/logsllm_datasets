I attempted memory allocation debugging using the `--track-allocation=user` and `--track-allocation=all` flags with Julia versions 0.3.4 and 0.4 on Windows 7. The issue encountered is that `.mem` files are not being generated for user source code. Instead, these files are only being created for Julia core files.
