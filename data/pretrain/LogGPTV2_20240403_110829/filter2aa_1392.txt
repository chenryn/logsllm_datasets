BSODomizer HD
• History
• HDMI 101
• FPGA: WTF?!
• Design
• Challenges
In Debt to Our Friends
• Kris Bahnsen (l33tbunni)
• Raivis Rengelis (RaivisR)
• Parker Dillmann (LonghornEngineer)

This project would not have happened without the 
help, support, and patience of...
The Original BSODomizer
• Released at DEFCON 16 (2008)
• XGA (1024 x 768) w/ text only
• Parallax Propeller, reprogrammable w/ PropClip
• 2x CR2032 Lithium coin cells
• Fully open source
• Wanted to learn about FPGAs
• Share our work with the hacker community
• Create another ridiculous (and possibly useful) project
Desired Features
• Mischief
• Full color, 1080p graphic capability
• User-loadable images from SD card
• Animated screens
• Legit
• Screen capture (for pentesting)
• Video display calibration
• Open source FPGA tool/reference design
HDMI 101
• High speed, differential signalling
• TMDS: 3 DATA + 1 CLK
• 1080p @ 60Hz is hard and fast
• Bit rate: ~3.6GHz
• Pixel clock: 148.5MHz
• Try doing that with a 
microcontroller!
• High speed processing                   
more efﬁciently handled                   
by FPGA
FPGA: WTF?!
• Blank slate of digital logic
• Conﬁgurable blocks/
connections
• Behavior deﬁned w/ 
schematic or HDL
• Design/purchase IP modules 
to create hardware
• System operates in parallel, 
synchronized to clock(s)
• Danger and confusion 
abounds!

Preliminary Block Diagram
FPGA: Cyclone V GX Starter Kit
• Cyclone 5CGXFC5C6F27C7N, $179 USD
• Performance v. power v. cost
• Got up and running in minimal time (~2 days)
• Terasic does not provide schematics or PCB layout in 
native format :(
HDMI TX: ADV7513
• Serialization converter to reduce resources of FPGA
• Included on the C5G dev. kit
• We provide RGB + control signals, it magically provides 
HDMI-compliant TMDS outputs
Early Proof of Concept
Early Proof of Concept
• Everything about FPGA development is slow!
• Dev. tools are giant and unwieldy
• Long compile/test cycles (~15 minutes)
• Verilog trial by ﬁre
• Needed to ﬁgure out how to draw on screen
img2mif
• Converts BMP to Memory Initialization File (MIF)
• Preload image into Cyclone V internal RAM
• https://github.com/joegrand/img2mif
• Forked from LonghornEngineer
Power Supply Trickery
• HDMI source current must be > 55mA per spec.
• FPGAs (esp. development boards) are power hungry
• How to allow pass-through mode to work at all times?
• How to provide power to FPGA system when needed?
Block RAM (1080p, 1bpp)
• Much trial and error
• Very frustration
• Wow
Proof of Concept Demonstration
Refinements
• Block RAM too small for full 1080p color image
• We need 1920 * 1080 * 24bpp = ~5.93MB
• External LPDDR2 SDRAM
• Micron MT42L128M32D1: 512MB @ 400MHz
• MicroSD card interface
• Want to store screen captures & user-deﬁned images
• Need to implement the rest of the circuitry, too!
• Combine everything into a functional demo
PIC Front End
• Microchip PIC16LF1829
• Control power to FPGA subsystem
• External triggering via IR (Sharp GP1US301XP 38kHz)
• Timer to delay BSOD (user conﬁgurable)
• A/D to monitor battery level
• Can be replaced with whatever your heart desires
Apple IR Remote
• NEC transmission protocol (same PHY, different data)
• Start: 9ms pulse burst, 4.5ms space
• Logic '1': 562.5μs pulse, 562.5μs space
• Logic '0': 562.5μs pulse, 1.6875ms space
• Bare bones detection w/ wide

HDMI RX: ADV7611
• Deserialization converter to reduce resources of FPGA
• Used HDMI Light V2 as a reference/breakout board, 
https://github.com/esar/hdmilight-v2
Interface Board
• C5G to HDMI RX (HDMI Light V2)
• T-Tech QuickCircuit 5000 for nearly instant gratiﬁcation
• 12 mil trace/14 mil space, easily delaminated during 
soldering, required tiny repairs
Other Subsystems
• Lithium Ion Battery Charging (Microchip MCP73833)
• HDMI Switch (Texas Instruments TS3DV642)
• HDMI Splitter (Hacked EnjoyGadgets unit)

HDMI Signal Path
Power Supply Path
• Front end & battery charging always via HDMI 5V
• FPGA subsystem only powered (by battery) when 
triggered
Current Measurements
• PIC Front End = HDMI 5V @ 1.76mA
• C5G Dev. Board (fully loaded) = LiPo 3.7V @ 438mA
• System functions down to 3.4V (limited by PIC to 3.6V)
• GSP585460 2000mAh, 3.7V Lithium Polymer
• Assume 70% of capacity down to 3.6V = 1400mAh
• ~3.2 hours of active BSODomy
• Read 32-bit word (8bpc RGB, MSB ignored) before it's 
needed on the screen
• Run memory access @ 2x PCLK (297 v. 148.5 MHz)
• Handle clock domain crossing with FIFO
• SignalTap II Logic Analyzer to peek inside the FPGA
• Trial and error, and error, and error, and error...
LPDDR2 SDRAM (1080p, 24bpp)
FPGA RTL View
Real World Demonstration
Gratuitous Display Modes
• Generated on-the-ﬂy
• Mostly used for debugging purposes
Other Challenges
• Extremely aggressive timeline
• Fractional PLL conﬂict and physical placement
• Crossing clock domains requires ﬁnesse/
synchronization to ensure signal integrity
• HDMI RX implementation started, but device not 
responding
• SD card/FAT32 implementation not done
• Typos or misdeﬁned signals/connections will not 
necessarily be detected by compiler!
• Debugging HDL is horrendous

In Closing
• Committed to a project way beyond our comfort zone
• Painful & practical lessons
• Easy access to FPGA development tools & resources, 
but still extremely complex
• FPGAs ﬁll a gap in the engineering world, worth giving 
them a try
• Sandwich to product? 
• Signiﬁcant engineering remains
• Demand may inﬂuence decision to bring to market
• Send desires to PI:EMAIL
The End
