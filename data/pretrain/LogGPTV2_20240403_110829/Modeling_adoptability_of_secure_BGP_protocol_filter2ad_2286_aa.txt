ABSTRACT
Despite the existence of several secure BGP routing protocols, there
has been little progress to date on actual adoption. Although feasi-
bility for widespread adoption remains the greatest hurdle for BGP
security, there has been little quantitative research into what prop-
erties contribute the most to the adoptability of a security scheme.
In this paper, we provide a model for assessing the adoptability
of a secure BGP routing protocol. We perform this evaluation by
simulating incentives compatible adoption decisions of ISPs on the
Internet under a variety of assumptions. Our results include: (a)
the existence of a sharp threshold, where, if the cost of adoption is
below the threshold, complete adoption takes place, while almost
no adoption takes place above the threshold; (b) under a strong at-
tacker model, adding a single hop of path authentication to origin
authentication yields similar adoptability characteristics as a full
path security scheme; (c) under a weaker attacker model, adding
full path authentication (e.g., via S-BGP [9]) signiﬁcantly improves
the adoptability of BGP security over weaker path security schemes
such as soBGP [16]. These results provide insight into the devel-
opment of more adoptable secure BGP protocols and demonstrate
the importance of studying adoptability of protocols.

INTRODUCTION
The security problems of BGP are well known [12]. S-BGP was
the ﬁrst proposal to address BGP security [9], and it has been fol-
lowed by numerous alternative proposals including soBGP [16],
IRV [3], SPV [6], Listen and Whisper [14], and psBGP [15]. De-
spite the availability of this wide range of innovative technologies
for BGP security, none of these protocols have been adopted by
ISPs. The reasons for this lack of adoption are complex and in-
volve many unmeasurable socio-political and economic factors.
From a more general viewpoint, the lack of adoption of secure
BGP protocols is a speciﬁc instance of the problem of predicting
interdomain protocol adoption, where the different parties consid-
ering protocol adoption do not necessarily have the same agenda.
There remains to date no quantitative analytical framework that can
assist computer-networking researchers in assessing the potential
for adoption of new protocols. In this paper, we present a new ap-
proach to the problem of analyzing interdomain protocol adoption:
instead of focusing on the phenomenological and strategic aspects
favored in economics and the social sciences, or on the standard
metrics typically favored by protocol researchers such as commu-
nications and memory overhead, we propose a new metric for pro-
tocol design, adoptability.
Intuitively, adoptability measures the
strength of a protocol’s properties in driving the adoption process.
Under this deﬁnition, a protocol with stronger properties will pro-
vide greater beneﬁts to its adopters and thus have greater adoptabil-
ity. We propose a simulation-based model for quantitatively deriv-
ing the adoptability of a protocol in any proposed context by iter-
atively considering the decision process of each potential adopter.
Using this methodology, we studied the problem of protocol adop-
tion for BGP-security protocols under various assumptions.
Typically, attractiveness for adoption is not quantitatively stud-
ied in proposed Internet protocols. Most newly developed protocols
claim at most incremental deployability, which means that the pro-
tocol can be gradually adopted over a period of time. During this
adoption period, adopters of the new protocol have full compati-
bility with non-adopters running a legacy protocol, while enjoying
some level of beneﬁt even though adoption is not universal.
Although incremental deployability helps in adoption, it is nei-
ther a necessary nor sufﬁcient condition. This is because incre-
mental deployability is an inherent property of the protocol, while
adoptability must necessarily involve the context in which the pro-
tocol is deployed (e.g., the Internet). Simply observing that a pro-
tocol possesses the property of incremental deployability does not
give any indication about the likelihood of widespread deployment
in any context; in fact, it does not even imply the existence of a
set of feasible scenarios in which widespread adoption could take
place. Similarly, not possessing incremental deployability does not
imply that adoption is impossible—a clearly superior technology
with a low transition cost might easily gain a sufﬁciently large base
of early adopters to ensure global adoption regardless of whether it
is incrementally deployable.
As mentioned, the adoptability of a protocol must be measured
with respect to some assumed deployment context—this includes
the group of potential adopters and their inter-relationships, and
various assumptions about their decision-making strategies. We
make the assumption that each potential adopter is rational and
selﬁshly motivated, and model the greedy incentives-compatible
adoption dynamics of a range of secure BGP protocols under var-
ious assumptions. Under the greedy bounded-rationality assump-
tion, an Autonomous System (AS) adopts the new protocol if and
only if the immediate security beneﬁts of adopting the protocol is
greater than some switching threshold, which represents the cost of
adoption. Typically, the more ASes that currently support a pro-
tocol, the greater is the beneﬁt enjoyed by a new adopter—this is
the well-known network effect in economics, a speciﬁc example
of which is Metcalfe’s Law. Hence, the adoption process across
the Internet is dynamic—as more ASes decide to adopt, their deci-
sions will drive new adoptions by other ASes which had formerly
found adoption unappealing. An incentives-compatible adoption
scenario is a scenario in which, starting with a pre-set group of ini-
tial adopters, we can iterate over the set of ASes and continually
ﬁnd ASes for which adoption is greedily rational, until either there
are no new adopters of the protocol, or all the ASes in the Internet
have adopted the scheme. By simulating these adoption scenar-
ios over a range of switching thresholds, we can chart the space of
switching thresholds for which the incentives-compatible adoption
process will yield widespread adoption of a given protocol. The
larger the range of switching thresholds that a protocol can support,
the greater its adoptability. Such an analysis yields a quantitative
evaluation of the practical attractiveness of a given set of security
properties in terms of how likely it is that these properties might
drive eventual full adoption of the protocol.
Using our model, we collect the adoptability results for each of
ﬁve classes of known security protocols. We observe that under
a standard strong attacker model, any scheme that provides weak
partial security, by implementing origin authentication with ﬁrst
hop authentication in the AS PATH, already has closely compara-
ble adoptability as a scheme with full path security (e.g., S-BGP).
This implies the surprising result that, under this attacker model,
the incremental gain to adoptability for increasingly strong secu-
rity properties is very small or nonexistent.
In contrast, under a
more realistic weak attacker model, the full-path security property
has up to ten times the adoptability of a scheme compared with
partial path security (e.g., soBGP) or simple origin authentication.
This implies that, for its trade-off of weaker security properties to
be attractive, soBGP needs to offer switching costs that are at least
ten times lower than S-BGP.
Modeling and measurement of adoptability are of great impor-
tance both to researchers seeking to create more viable protocols,
and to policy-makers seeking to select the best new technologies to
promote. In the course of formulating our approach to the problem,
we made many simplifying assumptions. Hence our results cannot
be used as direct predictions of the likelihood and/or cost of adop-
tion. However, the value of our work lies in the formulation of the
problem model, and the methodology for calculating a new met-
ric which can be used to compare the relative strengths of different
protocols in driving adoptability. This is an important problem that
has thus far not been the subject of intensive research.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Many protocols for secure BGP have been proposed. The main
security problems of BGP are outlined in an IETF draft by Mur-
phy [12]. S-BGP was proposed by Kent et al. [8, 9]. It approached
BGP security by securing the complete Update message by use of
attestations, which are essentially signatures within the context of a
public key infrastructure (PKI). Origin ownership is authenticated
through a PKI, while AS PATH attributes are similarly signed by
each contributing AS using route attestations. When an AS re-
ceives a BGP advertisement, it appends the next hop (i.e., the next
AS to which it will readvertise this preﬁx) to the AS PATH and
signs the new AS PATH along with all previous route attestations.
This provides assurance of the integrity and authenticity of the path.
White et al. [16] propose soBGP, where origin authentication is
accomplished in an oligarchy PKI similar to that in S-BGP. Un-
like S-BGP, soBGP does not use cryptographic mechanisms to se-
cure the authenticity of the entire AS PATH. Instead, AS PATHs
are veriﬁed against a database of AS-to-AS routing relationships.
Any path consisting of edges that are not present in the database is
considered malformed and is rejected. For example, if a path con-
tains two consecutive local ASes, neither of which claims to have
a relationship with the other, then it is detected as malformed by
soBGP and is rejected. Kruegel et al. augment this approach with a
topological anomaly detection heuristic [10].
Goodell et al. propose IRV [3], which proposes maintaining ded-
icated veriﬁcation servers to verify the authenticity of BGP adver-
tisements. Yu et al. propose a reputation-based scheme to evaluate
authenticity of BGP advertisements[18]. Aiello et al. also address
the problem of origin authentication through the use of Origin Au-
thentication Tags (OATs) [1]. Zhao et al. propose techniques for
detecting invalid multiple origin AS (MOAS) conﬂicts in the In-
ternet [22]. Subramanian et al. propose Listen and Whisper [14],
which protects AS PATH integrity while performing anomaly de-
tection by observing trafﬁc ﬂow. Hu et al. propose SPV [6] which
addresses AS PATH authentication through the use of one-time sig-
natures and symmetric cryptographic primitives, limiting the use
of expensive public-key cryptography. SPV possesses the property
that secure ASes further down the AS PATH can act for any in-
secure ASes earlier in the path by performing signatures on their
behalf. Wan et al. propose psBGP [15], which provides equivalent
path security beneﬁts to S-BGP along with slightly less secure but
more efﬁcient preﬁx ownership authentication. Zhao et al. propose
improved cryptographic primitives to make S-BGP efﬁcient [21].
To our knowledge there has not been any work on studying adopt-
ability as a metric for the usefulness of speciﬁc Internet protocols,
in order to guide design and policy decisions. However the general
process of adoption of new technologies is well studied in social
networks and economics [7]. He et al. have proposed a framework
for measuring incremental deployment properties of router-assisted
services [4], however they did not study the adoptability properties,
which are distinct from incremental deployability as explained in
Section 1.
3. A TAXONOMY OF PROPERTIES
We classify secure BGP protocols into the following categories.
Origin Authentication (OA) refers to the ability to authenticate
that a given AS is the legal owner of a preﬁx that it originates. An
origin authentication protocol ensures that if some AS A (which
speaks the protocol) originates a preﬁx, any other speaker AS can
verify that A is the legitimate owner of the preﬁx. While many
BGP security schemes contain an OA component, OA is consid-
ered a relatively weak property such that no pure OA scheme (e.g.,
OATs [1] or MOAS detection [22]) is meant as a self-contained so-
lution for BGP security. In practice, the owner of a preﬁx could
authorize a different organization to originate the preﬁx. Since this
implies an explicit trust relationship between the owner and the
originator, this does not change our analysis.
First-hop Authentication (OA+1) refers to a hypothetical origin
authentication protocol where the originator of the preﬁx addition-
ally encodes the identity of the ﬁrst-hop AS on the path from itself
(for example, by signing the identity of the next AS into the pre-
ﬁx ownership attestation). This ensures the integrity of ﬁrst two
ASes on the AS PATH. We abbreviate this property as “OA+1” to
indicate that it can be enabled by only a small additional step to
origin authentication. As with OA, no actual secure BGP protocol
implements just OA+1. An example of OA+1 could be a limited-
functionality version of S-BGP protocol where only the originating
AS signs any attestations (i.e., the address attestation and the ﬁrst-
hop route attestation only).
Routing Topology Path Veriﬁcation (RTPV) is the path secu-
rity model employed in soBGP [16]. Under RTPV, any advertised
AS PATH must conform to some authenticated map of the AS-level
routing structure of the Internet. IRV [3], the reputation mechanism
of Yu et al. [18], and the heuristics of Kruegel et al. [10] are also
examples of protocols which achieve this property. In our analysis,
we assume that each speaker AS only has a partial view of the In-
ternet routing topology corresponding to the neighborhood of the
other speaker ASes, since the topological information of insecure
nonspeaker ASes can be spoofed. This excludes the protocols from
using “well-known” but unauthenticated information in performing
path veriﬁcation—for example, soBGP cannot use the well-known
fact that all Tier-1 ASes have peering agreements with each other
unless all the Tier-1 ASes are soBGP speakers. Such an assump-
tion is unrealistic, but it is a necessary simpliﬁcation. Without this
assumption, it would be necessary to label all n× n potential edges
in the AS graph with some assumed function of conﬁdence, which
would make our analysis intractable.
Path Authentication (PA) is the path security model employed in
S-BGP [16]. psBGP [15] provides a more efﬁcient method of origin
authentication but secures its path information in a manner similar
to S-BGP, and hence possesses identical PA properties. In S-BGP,
every S-BGP speaker AS on the AS PATH is involved in signing
the path and providing assurance to its complete authenticity up
to the ﬁrst non-speaker AS (e.g., ASi) in the AS PATH. Since ASi
is not an S-BGP speaker, it will not have the requisite keypairs to
perform any S-BGP signatures. In particular, it will not be able
to sign the next AS (ASi+1) into the route attestation chain. This
yields a gap in the chain of signatures that an attacker can exploit
by stripping away all cryptographic information for any ASes after
ASi, giving it the ability to arbitrarily forge the remainder of the
AS PATH after ASi.
Retroactive Path Integrity (RPI) is the path security model of
SPV [6]. RPI addresses the drawbacks of PA by allowing subse-
quent secure ASes to perform digital signatures on behalf of earlier
non-deploying ASes so that the chain of integrity is not broken.
This ensures that the integrity of the path is protected up to the lat-
est secure AS on the path (rather than the ﬁrst non-deploying AS
