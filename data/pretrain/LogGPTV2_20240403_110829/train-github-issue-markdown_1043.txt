Documentation of 1.0.0 (http://docs.python-
requests.org/en/v1.0.0/user/advanced/) says  
`requests.session(auth=auth, headers=headers)` is a legitimate statement.
However, reading the code I see that session(), nor Session. **init** do not
take any arguments.

So if I have not misread anything, the docs should be fixed demonstrating the
way to set persistent session-specific headers, auth etc.
