## Abstract
Network operators use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to control the global visibility of their networks. When an IP prefix is withdrawn from the Internet, the origin network sends BGP withdrawal messages, which should propagate to all BGP routers holding an entry for that IP prefix in their routing tables. However, network operators occasionally report issues where routers maintain routes to withdrawn IP prefixes, a problem we refer to as "BGP zombies." Using RIS BGP beacons, a set of prefixes withdrawn every four hours, we characterize the appearance of BGP zombies. Across the 27 monitored beacon prefixes, we observe more than one zombie outbreak per day on average. The presence of zombies is highly volatile, with a monitored peer missing 1.8% of withdrawals for IPv4 (2.7% for IPv6). We also discovered that BGP zombies can propagate to other ASes, affecting customer networks. Employing a graph-based semi-supervised machine learning technique, we estimate the scope of zombie propagation and find that most outbreaks are small (on average, 10% of monitored ASes for IPv4 and 17% for IPv6). We also report some large outbreaks affecting almost all monitored ASes.

## 1. Introduction
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) governs inter-domain routing on the Internet. Understanding its behavior is crucial for the tens of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that make up the Internet. These ASes expect to rapidly change the routing and reachability of the address space they originate towards all other ASes. The process of announcing and withdrawing address space is of utmost importance.

When an origin AS withdraws a prefix, it sends a withdrawal message to its BGP neighbors, who propagate it further. Sometimes, a network sees the best path it propagated to neighbors disappear, but in a rich topology, alternative paths may still exist. In such cases, neighbors receive the best alternative path instead of a withdrawal. This process, called path hunting, typically causes several BGP path changes before a prefix is fully withdrawn. The richer the topology between the origin AS and a BGP speaker, the more path changes occur.

Theoretically, this withdrawal process ends with the prefix completely withdrawn from all BGP speakers. In practice, however, this sometimes fails, leading to stuck routes or "zombie routes." Path hunting can get stuck, leaving BGP routes visible at some BGP routers, observable with route collector systems like RIS, Routeviews, and Isolario.

This work is motivated by the operational confusion caused by missing withdrawals. We have observed cases where zombie routes cause confusion about the state of the withdrawn address space. Troubleshooting and cleaning zombie routes is a burden for network operators. This phenomenon is relatively unknown outside network operator circles and generally not well understood. Our goal is to shed light on BGP zombies, making the research community aware of this problem and assisting operators.

In this study, we characterize zombie routes using the RIS routing beacons, providing the first characterization of BGP zombies and a method to infer the scope of zombie outbreaks using a graph-based semi-supervised machine learning algorithm. Our experiments reveal a surprisingly high number of zombies, seen daily in our dataset. However, the number of affected ASes is usually limited (on average, 10% of monitored ASes for IPv4 and 17% for IPv6). The appearance of zombie routes is erratic, rarely emerging for numerous prefixes simultaneously. The average likelihood of observing a zombie for a given RIS peer and beacon prefix is 1.8% for IPv4 and 2.7% for IPv6. Finally, we show that numerous zombie paths are revealed during path hunting, and the scope of an outbreak is usually related to the affected transit networks.

## 2. BGP Zombies
Before delving into the detailed analysis of BGP zombies, we define the related terminology and explain our experimental setup. A BGP zombie refers to an active Routing Information Base (RIB) entry for a prefix that has been withdrawn by its origin network and is no longer reachable. In this paper, we also refer to zombie ASes and zombie peers for ASes and BGP peers whose routers have BGP zombies. We define a zombie outbreak as the occurrence of all zombies corresponding to the same prefix and appearing during the same two-hour time slot. The outbreak size is the number of zombie ASes.

### 2.1 Experimental Setup
To observe BGP zombies, one must withdraw an IP prefix from its origin AS and inspect RIB changes, or lack thereof, in other ASes. We conduct controlled experiments using RIPE's Routing Information Service (RIS) BGP beacons and RIS BGP data repository.

The RIS BGP beacons are a set of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes used solely for studying Internet inter-domain routing. These IP prefixes are announced and withdrawn at predetermined time intervals. Specifically, RIS BGP beacons are announced every day at 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00 UTC and withdrawn two hours after the announcements (i.e., at 02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, and 22:00 UTC). We monitor 27 beacon prefixes (13 IPv4 and 14 IPv6) announced from Europe, the U.S.A., Russia, Japan, and Brazil.

RIS archives RIB and BGP update messages collected at diverse places on the Internet. RIS collectors (named rrc00, rrc01, etc.) are mainly located at Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) and peer with hundreds of different ASes. Using this archive, we can monitor how these ASes respond to the BGP beacons stimuli and characterize the emergence of BGP zombies.

For beacon prefixes, detecting zombies in RIS peers is straightforward. We track the visibility of beacons for all RIS peers and report a zombie for each RIB entry that is still active 1.5 hours after the prefix was withdrawn. The 1.5-hour delay is empirically set to avoid late withdrawals due to BGP convergence, route flap damping, or stale routes. Each beacon's visibility is monitored in near-real-time using the RIPEstat looking glass, allowing us to trigger active measurements (e.g., traceroutes) during detected zombie outbreaks.

We conducted experiments during the three periods listed in Table 1 and detected a total of 5115 zombie outbreaks for the 27 monitored prefixes, each composed of one or more zombie routes for the same prefix.

### 2.2 Example
Figure 1 illustrates the visibility for beacon 84.205.71.0/24 from all RIS peers on September 9th and 10th, 2017. Peers are sorted on the y-axis, and time is represented on the x-axis. From 12:00 to 18:00 UTC, all peers behave as expected. At 12:00, RIS peers announce the availability of the beacon prefix and maintain an active route to the prefix until 14:00. One peer from rrc19 withdraws the prefix a bit late (14:19), but this is not considered a zombie because the prefix is withdrawn reasonably quickly. However, at 18:00, three peers do not withdraw the beacon, although the prefix is not reachable at that time. This zombie outbreak ends at 20:00 when the beacon is re-announced. A similar zombie outbreak appears at 22:00 for the same three peers.

During the first zombie outbreak (18:00-20:00), we found other zombies for the same three peers but another beacon (84.205.67.0/24). The 25 other beacons are withdrawn as expected at that time. For the second outbreak (22:00-00:00), we found no other zombies. These observations provide an early glimpse of the relationship between outbreaks for different prefixes. Zombie outbreaks for different beacons can be related but are usually independent. We formally investigate the co-occurrence of outbreaks from different beacons in Section 4.1.

### 2.3 Are Zombies Real?
To ensure that no artificial zombies are caused by measurement artifacts, we also looked for zombie evidence in other datasets.

First, for each zombie detected with the RIPEstat looking glass, we accessed the raw data from the RIS archive using BGPstream and checked that the withdrawal messages are indeed missing in the raw traces. We found 794 outbreaks reported by the looking glass but not present in the raw data. We ignored these events in our analysis; they are not listed in Table 1.

Then, we also looked at the presence of zombies in Routeviews data and NLNOG looking glass during large zombie outbreaks and confirmed that zombies are also present there. As Routeviews and RIS now use different software for data collection (ExaBGP vs. Quagga/Zebra), we assume that observed zombies are not caused by malfunctioning collectors.

Finally, during zombie outbreaks, we performed traceroute measurements towards beacon prefixes from Atlas probes located in zombie ASes. The traceroutes reveal that border routers in zombie ASes are indeed forwarding packets, whereas other routers usually drop these packets. We also use these traceroute results to evaluate our method to infer zombie ASes on AS paths (Section 3.2).

## 3. Hunting Zombies
With the simple zombie detection technique described above, we observe zombies only in ASes peering with RIS collectors. In this section, we show that the withdrawn and zombie AS paths collected by RIS also enable us to infer zombie ASes beyond RIS peers and estimate the scope of outbreaks.

For each outbreak, we retrieve the AS path of zombie entries and the last valid path for peers that have correctly withdrawn the beacon. A single path provides little information, but together, they reveal topological similarities that we consider evidence for the locations of zombies.
