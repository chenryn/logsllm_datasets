Abstract
While prior attempts at passwordless authentication on the
web have required specialized hardware, FIDO2’s WebAuthn
protocol lets users sign into websites with their smartphone.
Users authenticate locally via the phone’s unlock mechanism.
Their phone then uses public-key cryptography to authenti-
cate to the website. Using biometrics (e.g., ﬁngerprint, face)
for this local authentication can be convenient, yet may en-
gender misconceptions that discourage adoption. Through
three complementary studies, we characterized and sought
to mitigate misconceptions about biometric WebAuthn. We
also compared it to non-biometric WebAuthn and traditional
passwords. First, 42 crowdworkers used biometric WebAuthn
to sign into a website and then completed surveys. Critically,
67% of participants incorrectly thought their biometrics were
sent to the website, creating security concerns. In remote
focus groups, 27 crowdworkers then co-designed short no-
tiﬁcations to mitigate biometric WebAuthn misconceptions.
Through a 345-participant online study, we found that some
notiﬁcations improved perceptions of biometric WebAuthn
and partially addressed misconceptions, yet key misconcep-
tions about where the biometric is stored partially persisted.
Nonetheless, participants were willing to adopt biometric
WebAuthn over non-biometric WebAuthn or passwords. Our
work identiﬁes directions for increasing the adoption of bio-
metric WebAuthn by highlighting its security and usability.
1 Introduction
Despite their drawbacks, passwords remain widely used. A
typical user can have hundreds of password-protected on-
line accounts [44, 59]. To be secure, the user must create
(and remember) a unique password for each service. If they
reuse passwords across services, they are vulnerable to cre-
dential stufﬁng attacks, in which attackers exploit credentials
breached from one service to attack accounts on other ser-
vices where the user has a similar password [23, 43].
In
response, online services have introduced two-factor authen-
tication (2FA) [11, 51] and risk-based authentication [22, 62].

A user can also adopt a password manager to facilitate unique
passwords [45]. Sadly, adoption rates for these mechanisms
remain low [37, 45] and industry has thus continued to search
for an alternative to passwords for signing into websites [26].
One of the most promising approaches for passwordless
web authentication is the FIDO2 Project [5] and its web au-
thentication (WebAuthn) protocol. The core idea is to use
public-key cryptography in place of a password. To regis-
ter with a website, the user’s authenticator (hardware token
or other device) creates a public-private keypair unique to
that website. Subsequent authentication attempts proceed via
a challenge-response protocol, overcoming many disadvan-
tages of passwords and also stopping phishing attacks [32].
Hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKeys) are commonly used as
authenticators [5]. Recent user studies have demonstrated
that using WebAuthn with a hardware security key achieves
substantial beneﬁts relative to passwords in both security and
usability [18,32]. The cost and inconvenience of security keys,
however, are impediments to widespread adoption [18, 32].
Fortunately, smartphones can also be used as FIDO2 au-
thenticators. Smartphones’ ubiquity and familiarity to users
makes this support a crucial advance beyond prior attempts at
passwordless online authentication. The private key is stored

in a trusted enclave on the smartphone. The user authorizes
each use of the private key via their usual mechanism for
unlocking their phone. This unlock mechanism ultimately is
a PIN, pattern, or password. However, schemes like Apple’s
Touch ID [9] and its Android equivalent enable users to un-
lock their phone with a biometric, such as a ﬁngerprint or face.
As a result, these biometrics can also be used to sign into a
website [5], an interaction we term biometric WebAuthn.
This ability to authenticate to websites using only a ﬁn-
gerprint or other biometric holds great promise. Because of
WebAuthn’s basis in public-key cryptography, it is far more
secure than a password. Similar to how support for biometrics
made phone unlocking much more convenient [7, 14, 63], bio-
metric WebAuthn promises better usability than passwords.
Furthermore, support for WebAuthn is quickly being added by
major websites, including eBay, Microsoft, and Yahoo [40].
Unfortunately, when biometric phone unlocking was intro-
duced, misconceptions were initially widespread [7, 14, 63],
and we hypothesized the same would hold true for biometric
WebAuthn. The superﬁcial appearance that a user is signing
into an online service with only their ﬁngerprint or face sug-
gests the potential for even more problematic misconceptions
about biometric WebAuthn’s security and usability. These
misconceptions could discourage the adoption of biometric
WebAuthn. Thus, our research focused on users’ initial en-
counters with biometric WebAuthn and their resultant expecta-
tions. We anticipate that many users will encounter biometric
WebAuthn for the ﬁrst time via a small notiﬁcation on a web-
site encouraging them to adopt the technology. Such short
notiﬁcations cannot possibly capture FIDO2’s technical com-
plexities. However, after looking at such a notiﬁcation for
a few seconds, many users will form expectations about the
scheme’s security and usability, ultimately deciding whether
to adopt biometric WebAuthn based on very little information.
While future work should examine how to better educate users
about how FIDO2 actually works, we focused on understand-
ing and improving these initial impressions and perceptions.
We thus conducted three complementary user studies to
understand and mitigate misconceptions about biometric Web-
Authn, as well as to compare it to non-biometric WebAuthn
(e.g., using a PIN) and site-speciﬁc passwords.1 For all stud-
ies, we did not expect participants to have any prior knowl-
edge of biometric WebAuthn or how it worked. Rather, our
intention was to understand their initial expectations relating
to security, privacy, usability, and trust. Study 1 and 3 were
conducted on participants’ personal Android phones, which
was the most common, fully supported FIDO2 conﬁguration
at the time of the study [20]. While we focused on phones,
FIDO2 aims to be widely available on many other platforms.
Our ﬁrst research goal was to understand how a user who
encounters biometric WebAuthn in the aforementioned brief

encounter extrapolates about its properties. Thus, in Study 1,
42 crowdworkers used biometric WebAuthn on an Android
phone to register and later authenticate at a website we con-
trolled. To understand participants’ preconceived notions, we
intentionally gave little information about how WebAuthn
worked. Through surveys, we investigated how participants
thought biometric WebAuthn worked and explored potential
misconceptions suggested by either the literature or Web-
Authn’s design. Critically, 67% of participants incorrectly
thought their biometrics were sent to our website or elsewhere
outside their phone, leading to other misconceptions.
To help mitigate misconceptions we observed, especially
those that might discourage adoption, we then focused on
the design of short notiﬁcations that websites can display.
For example, Figure 1a shows eBay’s current notiﬁcation.
Designing any notiﬁcation that conveys complex technical
concepts in a short and simple format is a challenge in many
areas of security [21]. To this end, Study 2 engaged 27 par-
ticipants in seven online focus groups. After a moderator
taught participants how biometric WebAuthn worked and the
group discussed their perceptions of WebAuthn, participants
engaged in iterative co-design of new notiﬁcations. We dis-
tilled participants’ ideas into six potential notiﬁcations. To
align notiﬁcations with what users would actually want to
learn, our co-design focus groups took an unrealistically large
amount of time to help non-technical users better understand
how biometric WebAuthn works. They then collaboratively
proposed new notiﬁcations. This co-design approach, which
aims to beneﬁt from end-users’ creativity and opinions [39],
was motivated by prior research in which notiﬁcations for
2FA, TLS, cryptographic APIs, and phishing prevention ben-
eﬁted from similar focus groups [4, 25, 49, 60].
Finally, Study 3 compared these notiﬁcations inspired by
our co-design focus groups. Each of 345 crowdworkers was
assigned to use biometric WebAuthn (with one of those noti-
ﬁcations), non-biometric WebAuthn, or a site-speciﬁc pass-
word. Similar to Study 1, participants created an account
on our website and answered survey questions. One notiﬁ-
cation was a baseline representing how early-adopter com-
panies currently advertise WebAuthn. Relative to this base-
line, some notiﬁcations created through co-design improved
perceptions of biometric WebAuthn’s security and partially
addressed some key misconceptions. Furthermore, most par-
ticipants were willing to adopt biometric WebAuthn over non-
biometric WebAuthn and passwords for trustworthy websites.
Nonetheless, many participants still held key misconceptions,
especially about where their biometric is stored, highlighting
the need for more expansive education efforts.
Collectively, our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst comprehensive
examination of user misconceptions and perceptions about
using biometrics on phones for authentication on the web.
We discuss how our ﬁndings can inﬂuence how websites
communicate with users about biometric WebAuthn, helping
to spur adoption and move toward a passwordless web.

2 Background and Related Work
We ﬁrst detail how FIDO2 and WebAuthn work. We also
review the literature on FIDO2, biometric authentication, and
security warning design. We ﬁnish with related work applying
participatory design in the security and privacy domain.
2.1 FIDO2 and the WebAuthn Protocol
The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance is an industry as-
sociation formed to build a passwordless user experience by
authenticating users via public-key cryptography. In the past,
the FIDO Alliance was best known for its Universal 2nd
Factor (U2F) speciﬁcation enabling strong cryptographic two-
factor authentication [26]. U2F’s successor, FIDO2, enables
passwordless web authentication via two components. First,
the Client to Authenticator Protocol 2 (CTAP2) standardizes
communication between a client and (external) authentication
hardware. Second, the Web Authentication (WebAuthn) speci-
ﬁcation deﬁnes a JavaScript-based API allowing web services
to authenticate users via public-key cryptography.
To register on a web service, the user’s authenticator (hard-
ware) creates a public-private keypair unique to that web-
site. The authenticator can either be an external hardware
key (roaming authenticator) connected to a device via USB,
NFC, or Bluetooth, or a trusted module on the user’s existing
computer or smartphone (platform authenticator). To sign
into a web service, the authenticator signs a cryptographic
challenge received from the server. The server then veriﬁes
the signature using that user’s public key, received during
account registration. In contrast to password-based authenti-
cation, FIDO2 resists phishing, replay attacks, and breaches
of the server.
Users authorize their authenticator’s use of the private key
either by conﬁrming their presence via a button press or by
authenticating locally (user veriﬁcation). When using a smart-
phone as a platform authenticator, the phone’s unlock mech-
anism is typically used for this veriﬁcation step. While non-
biometric unlock mechanisms (e.g., PIN, pattern, password)
can be used, so can biometric mechanisms (e.g., ﬁngerprint,
face, iris). The latter is particularly notable because the use
of biometrics for phone unlocking is perceived as very con-
venient and is widely adopted [7, 14, 63], making biometric
WebAuthn a highly promising alternative to passwords for
authentication on the web. In the rest of this paper, we use
biometric WebAuthn as shorthand for using a biometric for
user veriﬁcation within the FIDO2 protocol suite.
Note that the user interface for veriﬁcation (cf. Figure 1b)
differs by OS, browser, and vendor. Furthermore, a web ser-
vice can require the use of either roaming or platform creden-
tials. Similarly, services can specify whether user veriﬁcation
(as opposed to mere presence) is required.
With the standardization of WebAuthn by the W3C in
2019, popular online service like Dropbox, eBay, Facebook,
GitHub, Microsoft, and Twitter have begun to implement
FIDO2-based single- or two-factor authentication. A key
challenge is to migrate existing users from passwords to Web-
Authn. FIDO2 involves complicated technical concepts and
terminology. Thus far, services have abstracted away most of
these technical details and security properties (cf. Figure 1a),
instead focusing on convenience and ease of use to encourage
adoption. Unfortunately, users might be left with incorrect
mental models of WebAuthn as a result.
2.2 Prior Studies of FIDO2 and WebAuthn
While we focus on biometric veriﬁcation within FIDO2, prior
