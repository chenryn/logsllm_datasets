## Abstract
While previous attempts at passwordless authentication on the web have required specialized hardware, FIDO2’s WebAuthn protocol allows users to sign into websites using their smartphones. Users authenticate locally via their phone’s unlock mechanism, and the phone uses public-key cryptography to authenticate to the website. Using biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, face) for local authentication is convenient but may lead to misconceptions that discourage adoption. Through three complementary studies, we characterized and sought to mitigate these misconceptions, comparing biometric WebAuthn to non-biometric WebAuthn and traditional passwords. First, 42 crowdworkers used biometric WebAuthn to sign into a website and completed surveys. Critically, 67% of participants incorrectly thought their biometrics were sent to the website, raising security concerns. In remote focus groups, 27 crowdworkers co-designed short notifications to address these misconceptions. A subsequent 345-participant online study found that some notifications improved perceptions of biometric WebAuthn and partially addressed misconceptions, but key misunderstandings about where biometrics are stored persisted. Despite this, participants were willing to adopt biomic WebAuthn over non-biometric WebAuthn or passwords. Our work identifies directions for increasing the adoption of biometric WebAuthn by highlighting its security and usability.

## 1. Introduction
Despite their drawbacks, passwords remain widely used, with a typical user having hundreds of password-protected online accounts. To be secure, each service requires a unique password, and reusing passwords across services makes users vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks. In response, online services have introduced two-factor authentication (2FA) and risk-based authentication. Password managers can facilitate unique passwords, but adoption rates remain low, leading the industry to search for alternatives to passwords for web authentication.

One promising approach is the FIDO2 Project and its WebAuthn protocol, which uses public-key cryptography. To register with a website, the user’s authenticator (e.g., a smartphone) creates a unique public-private keypair. Subsequent authentication proceeds via a challenge-response protocol, overcoming many disadvantages of passwords and preventing phishing attacks. While hardware tokens like YubiKeys are commonly used, their cost and inconvenience limit widespread adoption. Smartphones, however, can also serve as FIDO2 authenticators, leveraging their ubiquity and familiarity to users. The private key is stored in a trusted enclave on the smartphone, and the user authorizes its use via their usual unlock mechanism, such as a PIN, pattern, or biometric (e.g., fingerprint, face).

The ability to authenticate to websites using only a biometric holds great promise, offering better security and usability than passwords. Major websites, including eBay, Microsoft, and Yahoo, are rapidly adding support for WebAuthn. However, initial misconceptions about biometric phone unlocking suggest similar issues for biometric WebAuthn. These misconceptions could discourage adoption. Our research focused on users’ initial encounters with biometric WebAuthn and their resultant expectations. We anticipate that many users will first encounter biometric WebAuthn via a small notification on a website. Such brief notifications cannot capture FIDO2’s technical complexities, but they shape users’ initial impressions and decisions. While future work should educate users about FIDO2, our focus was on understanding and improving these initial impressions and perceptions.

We conducted three complementary user studies to understand and mitigate misconceptions about biometric WebAuthn, comparing it to non-biometric WebAuthn and site-specific passwords. For all studies, we did not expect participants to have prior knowledge of biometric WebAuthn. Instead, we aimed to understand their initial expectations regarding security, privacy, usability, and trust. Studies 1 and 3 were conducted on participants’ personal Android phones, the most common, fully supported FIDO2 configuration at the time. While we focused on phones, FIDO2 aims to be widely available on many other platforms.

Our first research goal was to understand how a user who encounters biometric WebAuthn in a brief encounter extrapolates about its properties. In Study 1, 42 crowdworkers used biometric WebAuthn on an Android phone to register and later authenticate at a website we controlled. We intentionally provided little information about how WebAuthn works to understand participants’ preconceived notions. Surveys revealed that 67% of participants incorrectly thought their biometrics were sent to our website or elsewhere outside their phone, leading to other misconceptions.

To help mitigate these misconceptions, we focused on designing short notifications that websites can display. For example, Figure 1a shows eBay’s current notification. Designing any notification that conveys complex technical concepts in a short, simple format is challenging. In Study 2, 27 participants in seven online focus groups learned how biometric WebAuthn works and discussed their perceptions. They then co-designed new notifications, which we distilled into six potential options. This co-design approach, which benefits from end-users’ creativity and opinions, was motivated by prior research in which notifications for 2FA, TLS, cryptographic APIs, and phishing prevention benefited from similar focus groups.

Finally, Study 3 compared these co-designed notifications. Each of 345 crowdworkers was assigned to use biometric WebAuthn (with one of the notifications), non-biometric WebAuthn, or a site-specific password. Similar to Study 1, participants created an account on our website and answered survey questions. One notification was a baseline representing how early-adopter companies currently advertise WebAuthn. Some co-designed notifications improved perceptions of biometric WebAuthn’s security and partially addressed key misconceptions. Most participants were willing to adopt biometric WebAuthn over non-biometric WebAuthn and passwords for trustworthy websites. Nonetheless, many participants still held key misconceptions, especially about where their biometric is stored, highlighting the need for more expansive education efforts.

Collectively, our findings provide the first comprehensive examination of user misconceptions and perceptions about using biometrics on phones for web authentication. We discuss how our findings can influence how websites communicate with users about biometric WebAuthn, helping to spur adoption and move toward a passwordless web.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 FIDO2 and the WebAuthn Protocol
The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance is an industry association formed to build a passwordless user experience by authenticating users via public-key cryptography. Previously, the FIDO Alliance was known for its Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) specification, enabling strong cryptographic two-factor authentication. U2F’s successor, FIDO2, enables passwordless web authentication through two components: the Client to Authenticator Protocol 2 (CTAP2), which standardizes communication between a client and external authentication hardware, and the Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification, which defines a JavaScript-based API for web services to authenticate users via public-key cryptography.

To register on a web service, the user’s authenticator (hardware) creates a public-private keypair unique to that website. The authenticator can be an external hardware key (roaming authenticator) connected via USB, NFC, or Bluetooth, or a trusted module on the user’s existing computer or smartphone (platform authenticator). To sign into a web service, the authenticator signs a cryptographic challenge received from the server, which verifies the signature using the user’s public key. Unlike password-based authentication, FIDO2 resists phishing, replay attacks, and breaches of the server.

Users authorize the use of the private key either by confirming their presence via a button press or by authenticating locally (user verification). When using a smartphone as a platform authenticator, the phone’s unlock mechanism (e.g., PIN, pattern, password, or biometric) is typically used for this verification step. Biometric mechanisms (e.g., fingerprint, face, iris) are particularly notable because they are perceived as very convenient and widely adopted, making biometric WebAuthn a highly promising alternative to passwords for web authentication.

Note that the user interface for verification (Figure 1b) varies by OS, browser, and vendor. Additionally, a web service can require the use of either roaming or platform credentials and specify whether user verification (as opposed to mere presence) is required. With the W3C standardization of WebAuthn in 2019, popular online services like Dropbox, eBay, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft, and Twitter have begun implementing FIDO2-based single- or two-factor authentication. A key challenge is migrating existing users from passwords to WebAuthn, as FIDO2 involves complicated technical concepts and terminology. Services have abstracted away most of these details, focusing on convenience and ease of use, but this may leave users with incorrect mental models of WebAuthn.
