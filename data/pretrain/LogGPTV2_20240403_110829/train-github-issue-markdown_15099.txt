##### Detailed description
Is there any way to call imread() without filename but with image array?
##### Steps to reproduce
This is not a bug. But I want to know how to load image without filename.  
If I have received an image from somewhere and I want to load it as Opencv
matrix,  
I think it will be better to convert without writing file.  
But now I have to write the image to file and call imread() function.  
If there is another way to read image without writing file, please let me
know.
Thank you.
