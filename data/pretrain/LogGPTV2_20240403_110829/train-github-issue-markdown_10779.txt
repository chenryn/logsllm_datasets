## Alpha-dependent template matching (matchTemplate)
    Alpha channel support would be very useful in matchTemplate function, so that transparent pattern areas wouldn't affect the result. I've found the description of this problem on Stack Overflow:

    Hi Alexander, Andrew,
    awu has developed Alpha-dependent template matching for OpenCV. The source codes are available here: http://answers.opencv.org/question/16535/alpha-dependent-template-matching/.
    Can you add these codes to OpenCV?
    Thanks.
