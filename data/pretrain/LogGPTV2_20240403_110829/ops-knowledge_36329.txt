User: I want to write a simple program to manage the screen brightness on my laptop, running Python3 under Ubuntu Linux.
To directly change the screen brightness levels, I can deal with a single file in the folder /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0, called brightness.
(the maximum brightness is another text file called max_brightness, so it's easy to find)
The problem is, however, that I want to grant my program partial access to root permissions, just enough to modify the files in that folder (though, I'd like it to be flexible enough to choose any folder in /sys/class/backlight/, in case it's not named acpi_video0), but not actually run as root, as that may cause problems as it tries to access GTK for a graphical interface.
How do I grant a Python3 program partial root permissions?
Assistant: Don't you need to just launch the program as sudo (root not recommended), I am not sure you can run partial code as root. 
Alternately split the program into a  and  with some messaging schema between them
