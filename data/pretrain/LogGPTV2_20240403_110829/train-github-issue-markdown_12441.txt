I am transitioning from using Sublime Text 3 to Visual Studio Code for my front-end development. However, I've noticed that I can only open one instance of VS Code at a time. Occasionally, I need to work on multiple projects simultaneously. Is it true that the Windows version of VS Code only supports a single instance at a time?
