(TVPs) of domain names and detects/predicts malicious do-
main names. Figure 4 gives an overview of our system
architecture. DOMAINPROFILER is composed of two major
modules: monitoring and proÔ¨Åling. The monitoring module
collects various types of essential data to evaluate the mali-
ciousness of unknown domain names. The proÔ¨Åling module
detects/predicts malicious domain names from inputted target
domain names by using the data collected with the monitoring
module. The details of each module are explained step by step
in the following sections.
A. Monitoring Module
The monitoring module collects three types of information
that will be used later in the proÔ¨Åling module. The Ô¨Årst type of
information is domain name lists. As discussed in Section II,
we need to collect the legitimate/popular domain name list
(Alexa) and malicious domain name list (hpHosts) on a daily
basis to create a database of listed domain names and their
time-series variations.

The second type of information is historical DNS logs,
which means time-series collections of the mappings between
domain names and IP addresses. A passive DNS [4] is one
typical way to collect such mappings by storing resolved DNS
answers at large caching name servers. Due to the privacy
policy of our organization, we do not use the passive DNS
approach. Instead, we actively send DNS queries to domain
names to monitor and build a passive DNS-like database. On
the plus side, this active monitoring contains no personally
identiÔ¨Åable information of the senders. Moreover, we can
control DNS queries so as not to contain disposable domain
names [5], which are non-informative and negatively affect
the database. For example, disposable domain names are
automatically generated and one-time use domain names to
obtain a user‚Äôs environmental information by using certain
anti-virus products and web services. Since these domain
names are distinct, their mappings between domain names
and IP addresses signiÔ¨Åcantly increase the database size with
non-informative information for evaluating the maliciousness
of domain names. On the minus side of active monitoring,
we can only query known domain names and cannot gather
the mappings of unknown domain names. Thus, we have
expanded known existing domain names as much as possible
to partially address this issue. For example, we have extracted
all domain names in domain name lists such as Alexa and
hpHosts. Moreover, we crawl approximately 200,000 web
pages every day to gather web content and extract domain
names. Furthermore, we query a search engine API (2.5M
queries/month) to expand the domain names based on the
above results.
The third type of information is the ground truth, which
will be used to label the training dataset and evaluate the
effectiveness of our system. Our ground truth includes the
results of web client-based honeypots (honeyclients) and
sandbox systems, and some subscription-based data such as
VirusTotal [6] and professional services by a security vendor.
The details of the ground truths we used are given later in
Section IV-A.
B. ProÔ¨Åling Module
The proÔ¨Åling module consists of three steps. Each step
uses the information collected from the monitoring module
to Ô¨Ånally output malicious domain names from inputted target
domain names.
1) Step 1: Identifying TVPs: Step 1 identiÔ¨Åes the TVPs for
each input target domain name. The deÔ¨Ånition was already in-
Fig. 6. Graph for Related IP Addresses (rIPs)
troduced in Section II. First, we query the input domain name
to the domain name lists database to obtain the time-series data
of listed domain names that match the second-level domain
(2LD) part of the input domain name. The database consists
of Ô¨Åve domain name lists: Alexa1k, Alexa10k, Alexa100k,
Alexa1M, and hpHosts.
To precisely deÔ¨Åne the TVP of every domain name, we
deÔ¨Åne that the top-level domain (TLD) includes an effective
TLD or public sufÔ¨Åx [7] such as .com.au, .co.jp and .co.uk,
as shown in Fig. 5. In general, TLDs are divided into generic
top-level domains (gTLDs), such as .com, .net, and .org, and
country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .au, .jp, and
.uk. If we do not use effective TLDs, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant
difference in 2LD parts between gTLDs and ccTLDs. For
example, in the gTLD case of ‚Äúfoo.bar.example.com‚Äù, the
in the ccTLD case
2LD part
of ‚Äúbaz.qux.example.co.jp‚Äù,
is ‚Äúco.jp‚Äù. Our
deÔ¨Ånition of including effective TLDs is intended to treat both
gTLD and ccTLD identically, that is, the 2LD part in the above
ccTLD example is ‚Äúexample.co.jp‚Äù in this paper.
is ‚Äúexample.com‚Äù; however,
the 2LD part
Second,
the TVPs of the matched 2LD parts within a
speciÔ¨Åed time window are identiÔ¨Åed using the predeÔ¨Åned
patterns (null, stable, fall, and rise), as shown in Section II.
Third,
the numbers of matched 2LD parts for the four
patterns are counted and used as feature vectors in a machine
learning algorithm. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the feature vectors created
in step 1 correspond to Nos. 1‚Äì20 of the features listed in
Table II; that is, Nos. 1‚Äì4 are for Alexa1k, Nos. 4‚Äì8 are for
Alexa10k, Nos. 9‚Äì12 are for Alexa100k, Nos. 13‚Äì16 are for
Alexa1M, and Nos. 17‚Äì20 are for hpHosts.
2) Step 2: Appending DNS-based Features: Step 2 appends
DNS-based features to the output of step 1, which are input tar-
get domain names with identiÔ¨Åed TVPs. This step is intended
to detect malicious domain names that share common features
in terms of IP addresses and domain names. We reviewed and
analyzed the typical features proposed for known approaches
to select
the DNS-based features. The known approaches
related to ours are summarized later in Section VI. As a result
of verifying the availability and effectiveness of the features,
we decided to follow the features proposed for Notos [8]. The
DNS-based features are mainly divided into two types: related
IP addresses (rIPs) and related domain names (rDomains).
To acquire features of rIPs, we need to Ô¨Årst construct a

graph of rIPs for each target domain name. Figure 6 shows an
example of rIPs for ‚Äúfoo.example.com‚Äù. The graph is a union
of every resolved IP address corresponding to each domain
name at the FQDN level and its parent domain name levels
such as 3LD and 2LD from historical DNS logs collected in
the former monitoring module. In the case of Fig. 6, the FQDN
and 3LD (foo.example.com) correspond to the IP address
192.0.2.2 at the time t ‚àí 1 and 198.51.100.2 at t, and the
2LD (example.com) corresponds to the IP address 192.0.2.1
at t ‚àí 1 and 198.51.100.1 at t. Thus, these four IP addresses
are deÔ¨Åned as rIPs for ‚Äúfoo.example.com.‚Äù Then, we extract
the features from rIPs. These features consist of three subsets:
border gateway protocol (BGP), autonomous system number
(ASN), and registration.
The BGP features, Nos. 21‚Äì29 in Table II, are created from
the information of BGP preÔ¨Åxes corresponding to the related
IP addresses (rIPs) of each target domain name. To obtain the
required BGP information, we refer to the CAIDA dataset [9].
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we extract the number of rIPs‚Äô BGP preÔ¨Åxes of
the target FQDN (No. 21), that of the 3LD part of the target
(No. 22), and that of the 2LD part of the target (No. 23); the
number of countries for the BGP preÔ¨Åxes of the target FQDN
(No. 24), that of the 3LD part of the target (No. 25), and that
of the 2LD part of the target (No. 26); the number of rIPs for
the 3LD part of the target (No. 27) and that for the 2LD part
of the target (No. 28); and the number of organizations for the
BGP preÔ¨Åxes of the target FQDN (No. 29).
The ASN features, Nos. 30‚Äì32 in Table II, are created from
the ASN information corresponding to the rIPs of each target
domain name. To obtain the ASN information, we refer to
the MaxMind GeoIP2 databases [10]. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we extract
rIPs‚Äô ASNs of the target FQDN (No. 30), that of the 3LD part
of the target (No. 31), and that of the 2LD part of the target
(No. 32).
The registration features, Nos. 33‚Äì38 in Table II, are created
from the IP address registration information corresponding to
the rIPs of each target domain name. To obtain the registration

information, we refer to the information of delegated IP
addresses [11] from all regional Internet registries (RIRs),
namely AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE NCC.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we extract the number of RIRs of the rIPs for
the target FQDN (No. 33), that of the 3LD part of the target
(No. 34), and that of the 2LD part of the target (No. 35); as
well as the diversity or number of allocated dates of the rIPs
for the target FQDN (No. 36), that of the 3LD part of the target
(No. 37), and that of the 2LD part of the target (No. 38).
On the other hand, to acquire the features of related do-
main names (rDomains), we need to construct a graph of
rDomains for each target domain name using the historical
DNS logs collected in the monitoring module. Figure 7 shows
an example of rDomains for ‚Äúfoo.example.com‚Äù. The graph
is a union of domain names pointing to IP addresses in the
same autonomous system number (ASN) of the historical IP
addresses of each target domain name. In the case of Fig. 7,
the ASN for the target ‚Äúfoo.example.com‚Äù is AS64501 and
