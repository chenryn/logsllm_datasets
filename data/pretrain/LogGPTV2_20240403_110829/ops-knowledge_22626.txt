User: Right now I get a blank page when localhost runs, but the deployed app is fine. The logs show the "database is locked". How do I "unlock" the database for localhost?
Assistant: This can happen if you're running multiple instances of dev_appserver without giving them distinct datastore files/directories. If you need to be running multiple instances, see dev_appserver.py --help and look at the options for specifying paths/files.
