A POST-LIQUIDATION PRICE MOVEMENT
MEASUREMENT
Auction liquidators are exposed to the risk that the price of collateral
further declines during the auction, which may cause a loss to
the liquidator. In the following, we study the price movement of
collateral with respect to the debt currency after the settlement
of a fixed spread liquidation and after the initiation of an auction
liquidation. For each observed liquidation, we record the block-by-
block oracle prices for a duration of 1,440 blocks, which corresponds
to about 6 hours. We summarize the following patterns of the post-
liquidation price movement.

‚Ä¢ Horizontal: The collateral price does not change after liq-
‚Ä¢ Rise: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price remains higher
‚Ä¢ Fall: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price remains lower
‚Ä¢ Rise-Fall Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price first rises
beyond the liquidation price, then falls below the liquidation
price.
‚Ä¢ Fall-Rise Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price declines
below the liquidation price, and then rises above the liquida-
tion price.
‚Ä¢ Rise-Fluctuation: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price
first rises beyond, then declines below the liquidation price,
and repeats such movement more than twice.
‚Ä¢ Fall-Fluctuation: Within 1,440 blocks, the collateral price
first declines below, then rises beyond the liquidation price,
and repeats such movement more than twice.
We observe that the collateral price remains below the liquidation
price by the end of the observation window for only 19.07% of the
28,138 observed liquidations. If those liquidations would have been
conducted through an auction, the liquidator might have suffered a
loss.
B MONTHLY DAI/ETH LIQUIDATIONS
In Table 8, we show the number of monthly liquidations that are
repaid in DAI and collateralized in ETH on Aave V1, Aave V2,
Compound, dYdX, and MakerDAO.
