##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.1.1
  * Operating System / Platform => Ubuntu 18.04
  * Compiler => Python 3.6
##### Detailed description
Documentation for `cv2.randn` says _Fills the array with normally distributed
random numbers_ , so I expect it to fill whole array, but it actually works
only with the channel 0. Later it says _dst - output array of random numbers;
the array must be pre-allocated and have 1 to 4 channels_ , means 3 channel
images are allowed and it should fill the whole array. The same for
`cv2.randu`.
##### Steps to reproduce
This code
    noise = np.zeros((10,10,3), dtype=np.uint8)
    print(cv2.randn(noise, 128, 50)[:,:,1:])
    print(cv2.randu(noise, 0, 255)[:,:,1:])
prints only zeros.
