User: I'd like to run modified remote_api_shell.py in an iPython notebook web interface, so that non-technical users with a basic grasp of Python could have read-only access to our production database.
Has anyone set something like this up, and what's the best way of going about it?
Assistant: iPython Notebook has profile directories in ~/.ipython, which have a startup directory for Python scripts that can be used to do the customization of sys.path and login credentials as remote_api_shell.py does.
