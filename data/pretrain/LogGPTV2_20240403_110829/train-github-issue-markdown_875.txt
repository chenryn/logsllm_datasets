## Expected Behavior
App should work after upgrading to Next v5.1.0. in Next-js supported browsers.
## Current Behavior
Noticed ` 'Symbol' is undefined` issue in IE11 after upgrading to Next v5.1.0.
We don't see this issue with Next v4.x.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Upgrade app, which has for-of loop in its source code, to Nextv5.1.0.
  2. Open the application in IE 11 after build process and check the dev console.
## Context
This is happening with Next v5.1.0.
Code generated for `for-of` loop with Next v5.1.0
    for (var g = l[Symbol.iterator](), w; !(h = (w = g.next()).done); h = true) {                        
    }
Next v4.x version with same source code.
    for (var h, g = (0,r.default)(l); !(y = (h = g.next()).done); y = !0) {
    }
We can fix the issue by adding `babel-polyfill` or `babel runtime-transform`
to our code but it would be consistent if we have a solution as part of Next
build.
