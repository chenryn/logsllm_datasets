4.2 PIN Choices
We investigate the factors that motivate PIN choices by
asking participants to rank the importance of four crite-
ria when they are choosing PINs: security, memorability,
usability, and reusability. The normalized score (rescaled
to have values between 0 and 1) from the participants is
plotted in Figure 2. The ranking was normalized for better
comparisons between PIN choices of di(cid:29)erent asset types.
Figure 2 shows that memorability is the most important
factor for participants when they are choosing PINs across
di(cid:29)erent asset types. Security and usability (de(cid:27)ned as "ease
to enter the PIN" for our participants to di(cid:29)erentiate from
memorability) were the next most important factors for the
participants. While participants reported reusing PINs (see
Section 4.5), they ranked reusability as the least important
factor for di(cid:29)erent asset types. The average ranks (1–4, 1
being most important) for memorability, security, usabil-
ity, and reusability across assets were 1.52, 2.25, 2.83, and
3.40, respectively. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows a statisti-
cally signi(cid:27)cant di(cid:29)erence between the ranks chosen for
the four criteria ((3)=130.93, < 0.01). Post hoc pair-

Interview scripts show that while participants ranked
reusability as the least important factor, participants were
reusing PINs for reasons of memorability.
“Its really annoying to have to remember a new PIN so I
change them all to the one I was using. I wouldn’t be able
to keep track of what PIN is for which card if I didn’t make
them all the same. I have (cid:27)ve cards that have PINs.” (P28)
4.3 PIN Update
For each asset category, we asked participants to recall the
last time they updated a PIN. Participants reported 49 inci-
dents of PIN changes (22, 18, and 9 for digital, (cid:27)nancial, and
physical assets, respectively). The number of reported PIN

4.4 PIN Sharing
Two factors that possibly in(cid:30)uence PIN sharing habits
include the type of asset (e.g., home lock vs. smartphone
PIN) and co-habitation.
For the former, we separately
report the sharing habits for di(cid:29)erent asset types. For
the latter, we asked participants whom they lived with:
seventeen participants reported living with a spouse, seven
with roommates, four with a romantic partner, three with
parents, three with siblings, twelve with children, and two
by themselves.
The reported statistics for PIN sharing are provided in
Table 5. Only a few participants reported not sharing PINs
with anyone. For digital assets, only 6/32 (19%) participants
did not share their PINs. 21/32 (66%) participants shared
PINs for their digital assets with other people that they were
in a romantic relationship with. 9 (28%), 5 (16%), and 5
(16%) of the 32 participants shared their digital PINs with
children, friends, and siblings, respectively. Four partici-
pants reported sharing PINs of their digital assets because
they were in circumstances where they felt that they had
no other option but to share it temporarily. However, all of
them reported not updating PIN after sharing for trust or
other reasons:
“I had to share it with my step-child once that I was driving.
I thought about changing it but not too keen on changing
it since new PINs are a hassle. He visits us once a week only
so that is also a factor.” (P26)
For (cid:27)nancial assets, 7/34 (21%) participants reported not
sharing their PINs with anyone. Participants mostly shared
their (cid:27)nancial asset PINs with their romantic partners
(20/34 (59%)) and parents (3/34 (21%)). Only two partici-
pants reported sharing with friends to grab lunch or cof-
fee for them. Similar to digital PINs, three participants re-
ported inadvertent sharing of (cid:27)nancial PINs and not updat-
ing them later.
“I have given it to my son once too to buy something and
was concerned if he would try the same on my laptop or
smartphone. Yes, he knows those PINs now [laptop and
smartphone PINs—the same as their ATM card] but back
then he didn’t. Was holding another kid and there was an
urgent need to grab water from convenience store.” (P24)
As expected, for physical assets, all but one participant
shared their PINs with at least one other party. Other
than prevalent sharing among friends and family mem-
bers, 8/27 (30%) participants reported sharing physical PINs
with hired helpers (cleaners or pet caretakers). For physical
PINs, two cases of inadvertent sharing with strangers were

after their contact with the third parties had concluded. We
discuss the reasons for not updating physical PINs in Sec-
tion 5.
“Yes, it was shared with the furniture company that went
out of business, and nothing was done about it. Never had
a problem with the company so there is a trust.” (P11)
The self-reported sharing data on PINs from our study
shows widespread sharing as well as sharing across di(cid:29)er-
ent relationship types. Among participants that live with
their spouses, all but one (94%) shared their PINs for digi-
tal assets. For participants who reported living with a girl-
friend/boyfriend, all shared their digital PINs with their
partner. This (cid:27)nding is di(cid:29)erent from Kaye’s (cid:27)nding that
only a third or fewer participants reported sharing their
personal email and Facebook passwords, both primarily
with partners and close friends [27]. This di(cid:29)erence is ex-
pected because Kaye studied sharing habits for speci(cid:27)c on-
line services whereas, participants from our study reported
sharing habits for assets that are either more likely to be
shared (e.g., physical) or assets that are more generic in na-
ture (e.g., smartphones). Our (cid:27)ndings are congruent with
those of Matthew et al. [34] and Singh et al. [42] that people
share passwords with trusted family members.
4.5 PIN Reuse
We asked participants whether they reuse PINs (within the
same or across asset categories). Seven (20%) participants
reported not reusing PINs at all for security reasons. These
seven participants used 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, and 6 PINs in total.
Twenty-eight participants reported reusing PINs. As
discussed in Section 4.2, the reported underlying reason for
reuse was memorability. Out of these participants, 18 (64%)
reported reusing PINs across all categories. Three par-
ticipants reported reusing PINs within the same category
only (e.g., a common PIN for both their phone and tablet).
Findings also showed that three participants reported
reusing PINs across digital and physical categories, and the
same number reported reusing across digital and (cid:27)nancial
asset categories. Participants’ choice to not reuse PINs and
create new PINs for some assets was motivated to protect
against certain threats.
“[I have] shared PIN-A [(Cell phone, laptop, online account

asset categories.

(cell provider))] and PIN-C [(Net(cid:30)ix parental, xBox)] with
spouse and PIN-B with kids [(Home, Garage, tab)].” (P25)
During the interviews, several participants demonstrated
that they understood the risk of reusing PINs. However,
they either considered the reuse to be a secret or a chance
worth taking despite the risks involved.
“Well it is the same as my garage and alarm PIN. All (cid:27)-
nancial PINs are the same so I have shared it with my
wife, kids, dog walker, and cleaning lady but only my wife
knows it’s the same PIN for my bank.” (P28)
4.6 Attacks on PIN and Recourse
We asked participants to recall the last time a PIN in each
asset category may have been subjected to shoulder sur(cid:27)ng
or guessing attacks, regardless of the outcome of the at-
tacks. Figure 4 shows the distribution of participants who
perceive that an attack may have occurred on their PINs
of di(cid:29)erent categories. 25 participants (71%) recall experi-
encing a shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attack or being concerned that a
guessing attack had occurred on one or more of their PINs.
More participants reported attacks on PINs for digital and
(cid:27)nancial assets than for physical assets (26 and 17, respec-
tively vs. 8). Similarly, across all asset types, participants re-
ported more shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks than guessing attacks

attacks reported both di(cid:29)ered signi(cid:27)cantly between asset
types (2(2)=7.74, < 0.05 and2(2)=6.84, < 0.05,

respectively). Signi(cid:27)cantly more shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks
were reported for (cid:27)nancial assets than guessing attacks
We also asked participants regarding the recourse that
they took when they were subjected to attacks. Their re-
sponses were codi(cid:27)ed, and a summary of results is pre-
sented in Figure 5. For 23 of the potentially successful
attacks, participants reported taking no action to prevent
shoulder sur(cid:27)ng or guessing attacks across di(cid:29)erent asset
categories. The reasons reported for this inaction included
trusting the attacker (friend or family member), laziness, or
that the attack failed, so they felt action was not required.
“Yes, at work some colleagues have seen me enter it. Usu-
ally for meetings I have to open my device and enter PIN
in front of other people. I am not looking but can imag-
ine that every one who is next to me have seen it. Did not
change it and did not protect because it seems like people
would think that I do not trust them.” (P35)
Six participants reported updating PINs in response to an
attack—four for digital assets and two for (cid:27)nancial assets.
Note that when participants were asked about why they
updated a PIN (for a previous question, see Table 4), more
participants reported updating the PIN due to reasons of se-
curity. However, that over-reporting is due to compromises
through other types of attacks (e.g., online compromise of
a PIN-protected (cid:27)nancial asset). Other common defences
included covering the device screen or moving the screen
away from the attacker (similar to the (cid:27)nding of Eiband et
al. [18]).
5 Discussion
Our interviews uncovered interesting ways in which dif-
ferent asset categories can impact PIN management and
unique security and memorability challenges for PINs. In
this section, we discuss these issues. For qualitative anal-
ysis, two researchers independently performed thematic
analysis to identify themes from participant responses dur-
ing the semi-structured interview. Identi(cid:27)ed themes were
compared and discussed by reviewers until consensus was
reached. This approach is used by other researchers in the
(cid:27)eld (e.g., Acar et al. [2]).
5.1 PINs in Di(cid:29)erent Contexts
Our (cid:27)ndings show di(cid:29)erences between di(cid:29)erent asset types
in how participants share PINs and how PINs are attacked.
Participants also reported using di(cid:29)erent levels of protec-
tion for di(cid:29)erent types of assets. This behaviour was due
to di(cid:29)erent levels of perceived risk to di(cid:29)erent types of as-
sets and the possible recourse available to the users in case
9
the attacker was successful. For instance, (cid:27)ve participants
reported being less concerned about physical PINs than dig-
ital or (cid:27)nancial PINs and had comments similar to the fol-
lowing.
“Even if it was access to where the digital devices or money
[(cid:27)nancial] PINs are [through physical PINs], the risk of
breaking a physical PIN is higher for getting caught then
the other ones.” (P16)
Similar comments were from two participants who were
less concerned about other people learning their (cid:27)nancial
PINs.
“I would be a lot more concerned about someone accessing
my phone than my bank account. If a colleague were to
look into my phone or laptop I would not have a recourse
but if someone were to steal my money that will be a dif-
ferent thing.” (P35)
Two participants also reported caring less about their (cid:27)nan-
cial PINs because an attacker with their bank cards will be
able to perform transactions without needing the PIN.
“Not much [worried about PIN security] and I guess it is a
combination of factors. [Bank] card is on me and if some-
one were to get it they could tap-to-pay or do an online
transaction with the number on the back. And in that case
there is reimbursement for fraud.” (P35)
Only one participant reported being more concerned
about the physical PINs due to their perceived susceptibility
to shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks.
“Yes. I am worried someone would watch me enter it. They
may have binoculars. I always cover it [hand masking en-
try].” (P29)
The comments of participants indicate that with the
availability of possible recourse (i.e., police involvement for
physical or (cid:27)nancial assets), they were less careful about
the secrecy of their PINs. Egelman et al. [17] also reported
observing this rational behaviour for the use of security fea-
tures on smartphones and risk perceptions of users. How-
ever, while the perception that the attackers are less in-
clined to trespass on their property may be true, the major-
ity of participants reported reusing their PINs across other
categories.
5.2 Attack Susceptibility of PINs
In Section 4.6, we reported our (cid:27)nding that 27/35 (71%) of
participants reported attacks on PINs. Another interest-
ing theme that emerged from participants’ responses was
the high susceptibility of PINs to shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks.
Three participants voiced the concern that it is di(cid:28)cult to
enter a PIN without third parties in close proximity learn-
ing about it.
“My colleagues may know my PIN but not too sure whether
it is worth changing it because they will learn the new one
too. Mostly this happens when you unintentionally look at
someone entering it.” (P24)
This observation was also the reason why two of the par-
ticipants did not update their PINs after they were compro-
mised.
“My kids are not supposed to know it but they must have
seen me enter it on my previous phone when I did not have
a (cid:27)ngerprint id. [...] I am not too sure who else has knows
it or has cared to learn it.
I have seen many enter their
PINs and patterns before me but never cared for it.” (P33)
During the discussion on guessing attacks, the comments
