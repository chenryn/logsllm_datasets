# 4.2 PIN Choices

We investigated the factors that influence participants' PIN choices by asking them to rank the importance of four criteria: security, memorability, usability, and reusability. The normalized scores (rescaled to have values between 0 and 1) are plotted in Figure 2. The rankings were normalized to facilitate better comparisons across different asset types.

Figure 2 illustrates that memorability is the most important factor for participants when choosing PINs across various asset types. Security and usability (defined as "ease of entering the PIN" to differentiate from memorability) were the next most important factors. Reusability was ranked as the least important factor. The average ranks (1–4, with 1 being the most important) for memorability, security, usability, and reusability across assets were 1.52, 2.25, 2.83, and 3.40, respectively. A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a statistically significant difference between the ranks chosen for the four criteria (χ²(3) = 130.93, p < 0.01). Post hoc pairwise comparisons using Mann-Whitney U tests (Bonferroni corrected) showed statistically significant differences between all six pairs of criteria (all p < 0.001).

Despite ranking reusability as the least important factor, interview scripts indicated that participants reused PINs primarily for memorability reasons. One participant stated:
"It's really annoying to have to remember a new PIN, so I change them all to the one I was using. I wouldn’t be able to keep track of what PIN is for which card if I didn’t make them all the same. I have five cards that have PINs." (P28)

# 4.3 PIN Update

For each asset category, we asked participants to recall the last time they updated a PIN. Participants reported 49 incidents of PIN changes: 22 for digital, 18 for financial, and 9 for physical assets. The number of reported PIN updates varied significantly between asset types (χ²(2) = 2.94, p = 0.23).

# 4.4 PIN Sharing

Two factors that may influence PIN sharing habits include the type of asset (e.g., home lock vs. smartphone PIN) and co-habitation. We separately report the sharing habits for different asset types and living arrangements. Seventeen participants reported living with a spouse, seven with roommates, four with a romantic partner, three with parents, three with siblings, twelve with children, and two lived alone.

Table 5 provides the reported statistics for PIN sharing. Only a few participants reported not sharing PINs with anyone. For digital assets, 6 out of 32 (19%) participants did not share their PINs. 21 out of 32 (66%) participants shared PINs for their digital assets with romantic partners. 9 (28%), 5 (16%), and 5 (16%) of the 32 participants shared their digital PINs with children, friends, and siblings, respectively. Four participants shared their digital PINs temporarily due to circumstances but did not update them afterward.

For financial assets, 7 out of 34 (21%) participants reported not sharing their PINs. Most participants shared their financial PINs with romantic partners (20/34 or 59%) and parents (3/34 or 21%). Two participants shared their financial PINs with friends. Three participants inadvertently shared their financial PINs and did not update them later.

For physical assets, all but one participant shared their PINs with at least one other party. In addition to prevalent sharing among friends and family members, 8 out of 27 (30%) participants shared physical PINs with hired helpers (cleaners or pet caretakers). Two cases of inadvertent sharing with strangers were identified, but participants did not update the PIN even after contact with third parties had concluded.

# 4.5 PIN Reuse

We asked participants whether they reuse PINs (within the same or across asset categories). Seven (20%) participants reported not reusing PINs for security reasons. These seven participants used 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, and 6 PINs in total. Twenty-eight participants reported reusing PINs, with 18 (64%) reusing PINs across all categories. Three participants reused PINs within the same category only, and three participants reused PINs across digital and physical categories, and the same number across digital and financial asset categories.

The underlying reason for reuse was primarily memorability. Some participants chose not to reuse PINs and create new ones for specific assets to protect against certain threats. For example, one participant shared PIN-A (cell phone, laptop, online account) and PIN-C (Netflix parental, Xbox) with their spouse and PIN-B (home, garage, tablet) with their kids.

During interviews, several participants acknowledged the risks of reusing PINs but either considered it a secret or a chance worth taking despite the risks. One participant stated:
"Well, it’s the same as my garage and alarm PIN. All financial PINs are the same, so I have shared it with my wife, kids, dog walker, and cleaning lady, but only my wife knows it’s the same PIN for my bank." (P28)

# 4.6 Attacks on PIN and Recourse

We asked participants to recall the last time a PIN in each asset category may have been subjected to shoulder surfing or guessing attacks, regardless of the outcome. Figure 4 shows the distribution of participants who perceived that an attack may have occurred on their PINs of different categories. 25 participants (71%) recalled experiencing a shoulder surfing attack or being concerned that a guessing attack had occurred on one or more of their PINs. More participants reported attacks on PINs for digital and financial assets than for physical assets (26 and 17, respectively, vs. 8). Across all asset types, participants reported more shoulder surfing attacks than guessing attacks (23 vs. 14).

The number of shoulder surfing and guessing attacks differed significantly between asset types (χ²(2) = 7.74, p < 0.05 and χ²(2) = 6.84, p < 0.05, respectively). Significantly more shoulder surfing attacks were reported for financial assets than guessing attacks (χ²(1) = 11.29, p < 0.05).

We also asked participants about the recourse they took when subjected to attacks. Their responses were coded, and a summary of results is presented in Figure 5. For 23 potentially successful attacks, participants reported taking no action to prevent shoulder surfing or guessing attacks across different asset categories. Reasons for inaction included trusting the attacker (friend or family member), laziness, or the belief that the attack failed, so action was not required.

Six participants reported updating PINs in response to an attack—four for digital assets and two for financial assets. Note that when participants were asked about why they updated a PIN, more participants reported updating the PIN due to security reasons, often related to compromises through other types of attacks (e.g., online compromise of a PIN-protected financial asset). Other common defenses included covering the device screen or moving the screen away from the attacker.

# 5 Discussion

Our interviews uncovered interesting ways in which different asset categories can impact PIN management and unique security and memorability challenges for PINs. In this section, we discuss these issues. For qualitative analysis, two researchers independently performed thematic analysis to identify themes from participant responses during the semi-structured interview. Identified themes were compared and discussed by reviewers until consensus was reached. This approach is used by other researchers in the field (e.g., Acar et al. [2]).

## 5.1 PINs in Different Contexts

Our findings show differences between different asset types in how participants share PINs and how PINs are attacked. Participants also reported using different levels of protection for different types of assets. This behavior was due to different levels of perceived risk to different types of assets and the possible recourse available to users in case of a successful attack. For instance, five participants were less concerned about physical PINs than digital or financial PINs, with comments similar to the following:

"Even if it was access to where the digital devices or money (financial) PINs are [through physical PINs], the risk of breaking a physical PIN is higher for getting caught than the other ones." (P16)

Similar comments were made by two participants who were less concerned about others learning their financial PINs:

"I would be a lot more concerned about someone accessing my phone than my bank account. If a colleague were to look into my phone or laptop, I would not have a recourse, but if someone were to steal my money, that will be a different thing." (P35)

Two participants also reported caring less about their financial PINs because an attacker with their bank cards could perform transactions without needing the PIN:

"Not much [worried about PIN security] and I guess it is a combination of factors. [Bank] card is on me, and if someone were to get it, they could tap-to-pay or do an online transaction with the number on the back. And in that case, there is reimbursement for fraud." (P35)

Only one participant reported being more concerned about physical PINs due to their perceived susceptibility to shoulder surfing attacks:

"Yes. I am worried someone would watch me enter it. They may have binoculars. I always cover it [hand masking entry]." (P29)

Participants' comments indicate that with the availability of possible recourse (i.e., police involvement for physical or financial assets), they were less careful about the secrecy of their PINs. Egelman et al. [17] also reported observing this rational behavior for the use of security features on smartphones and risk perceptions of users. However, while the perception that attackers are less inclined to trespass on their property may be true, the majority of participants reported reusing their PINs across other categories.

## 5.2 Attack Susceptibility of PINs

In Section 4.6, we reported that 27 out of 35 (71%) participants reported attacks on PINs. Another interesting theme that emerged from participants' responses was the high susceptibility of PINs to shoulder surfing attacks. Three participants expressed concern that it is difficult to enter a PIN without third parties in close proximity learning about it.

One participant stated:
"My colleagues may know my PIN, but I'm not too sure whether it is worth changing it because they will learn the new one too. Mostly this happens when you unintentionally look at someone entering it." (P24)

This observation was also the reason why two participants did not update their PINs after they were compromised:

"My kids are not supposed to know it, but they must have seen me enter it on my previous phone when I did not have a fingerprint ID. [...] I am not too sure who else knows it or has cared to learn it. I have seen many enter their PINs and patterns before me, but never cared for it." (P33)

During discussions on guessing attacks, participants' comments further highlighted the challenges and vulnerabilities associated with PIN usage.
