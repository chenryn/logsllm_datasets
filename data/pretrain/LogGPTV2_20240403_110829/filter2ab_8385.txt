**ATT&CK ID:** C0017  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** [Technique Name] (Note: The technique name is missing in the original text. Please replace [Technique Name] with the correct name.)

**Description:**
During the execution of C0017, APT41 employed specific file naming conventions and modified file extensions to evade detection. Specifically, they used filenames beginning with "USERS," "SYSUSER," and "SYSLOG" for the DEADEYE malware. Additionally, they changed the file extension of KEYPLUG from `.vmp` to `.upx`, likely to avoid detection by security tools.[32]
