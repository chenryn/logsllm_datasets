To enhance the indexing performance and functional capabilities of Druid, we need to reevaluate the current indexing process. At present, v8 segments are generated using the IndexMerger and then converted to v9. A more efficient approach would be to build v9 segments directly, thereby streamlining the process and potentially improving overall system performance.
