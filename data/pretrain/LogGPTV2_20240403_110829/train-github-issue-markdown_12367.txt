## Expected Behavior
A page's `getInitialProps` should only be called once per page load.
## Current Behavior
Sometimes `getInitialProps` is called multiple times in one page load.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Minimal example app (almost identical to the next example app "custom-server-
express"): https://github.com/approots/next-express-issue
To reproduce:
  1. Run `npm run dev` and check the terminal console for multiple outputs of the console.log statement in the `getInitialProps` function of `pages/index.js` ("getInitialProps index").
  2. Or click the link to "post 2", refresh the page, then load the index page again (localhost:3000/), and check the terminal and see multiple console.logs of "getInitialProps index". This also happens in production.
## Context
This means that API calls are being duplicated.
