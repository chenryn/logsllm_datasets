**By Steve Dunker, J.D.**

#### I. When Can an Officer Legally "Stop" an Individual?

1. **Voluntary Stops**
   - An officer may at any time request that a person stop and talk.
   - The individual has the right to refuse.

2. **Investigative Stops**
   - Reasonable suspicion is required for an investigative stop.

3. **Administrative Stops**
   - These include various types of checkpoints and roadblocks.

4. **Road Blocks and Checkpoints**
   - **Border Checkpoints**: Officers can check all items entering the country. Routine searches do not require reasonable suspicion (RS) or probable cause (PC).
     - **Strip Search**: Requires reasonable suspicion.
     - **Body Cavity Search**: Requires probable cause.
   - **Drunk Driving Checkpoints**: Valid if proper procedures are followed.
   - **Other Roadblocks**:

     - **Weigh Stations for Trucks**: Valid.
     - **Game Warden Checkpoints**: Valid.
     - **Agricultural Inspection Checkpoints**: Valid.

#### II. When Can an Officer Legally Arrest an Individual?

- All arrests must be based on probable cause (PC).

**Probable Cause Defined:**
- Probable cause exists when there are sufficient facts and circumstances to lead a reasonable police officer to believe that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.

1. **Arrests in Public Places**
   - No warrant is required.

2. **Arrests in a Person's Own Home**
   - A warrant is generally required, unless there are emergency circumstances.

#### III. Searches

1. **When Does an Officer Have the Legal Right to Conduct a Search?**

2. **Consent Searches**
   - **Consent to Search a Person**: Only the individual or their minor child can give consent.
   - **Consent to Search Property**: A person with legal control over a vehicle or building can give consent.
   - **Who Can Give Consent?**
     - **Landlord**: Cannot give consent to search a tenant's property.
     - **Hotel Manager**: Cannot give consent to search a guest's room.
     - **Parents**: Can give consent to search all rooms of their home they maintain control over.
     - **Roommates**: Can give consent only to common areas and spaces under their control.

3. **Warrants**
   - If law enforcement has a warrant, you must allow them to search.
   - The police will not wait while you call your lawyer.

4. **Searches of Homes**
   - Usually requires a warrant.
   - **Knock and Announce Requirement**: Officers must knock and announce their presence.
   - **Plain View, Plain Smell, Plain Hear**: Officers must have a legal right to be there and use normal senses. Discovery must be by chance.

5. **Emergency Circumstances**
   - Ask: Is the evidence going to be destroyed? Is there some type of danger? Will the suspect avoid capture unless the officer acts quickly?
   - Emergency searches are limited to the circumstances.

6. **The Frisk**
   - A frisk is for weapons only.
   - Officers must have reasonable suspicion that a crime is "afoot" and that the suspect is armed.
   - A frisk is a pat-down only. Any item seized must be a weapon or "immediately apparent" contraband.

7. **Search Incident to an Arrest**
   - Requires a lawful arrest.
   - Search is limited to the person and the immediate area in their control.
   - Includes cars.

8. **Protective Sweeps**
   - Officers may perform a protective sweep for other people and weapons.

9. **Intimate Body Searches (Stomach, Cavity, etc.)**
   - Non-surgical searches require reasonable suspicion or probable cause depending on the circumstances.
   - Surgical searches require probable cause.

10. **Abandoned Property**
    - Any property that is "abandoned" can be examined and taken by the police.
    - Once your trash has been taken to the edge of your property, it can be taken by anyone, including the police.

11. **Student Searches**
    - **On High School Property**: No warrant or probable cause is required to run a dog. Only reasonable suspicion is required to search students and lockers.
    - **On College Property**: A warrant is required to search dorm rooms unless for safety or health reasons.

#### IV. Use of Tools to Aid in Searches

1. **Vision Enhancers (Binoculars, Night Vision)**
   - Can only be used for areas in public view; otherwise, a warrant is needed.
   - Cannot peep into windows.

2. **Hi-Tech Devices**
   - **Infrared**: Requires a warrant.
   - **X-Ray**: Requires a warrant except in safety-related areas with advanced notice.
   - **Metal Detector**: Usually a consent search that turns into a "frisk."

3. **Dogs**
   - The officer must have the "right" to be there.

#### V. Interception of Electronic Data

1. **Wire Tapping**
   - No wire tap without a warrant.
   - Warrant requirements:
     - Crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed.
     - Communications to be intercepted will contain information about the offense.
     - The place monitored is used in the offense.

2. **Pen Registers**
   - Not considered a search; no warrant needed.

3. **Cordless Phones**
   - Depends on the frequency. No warrant needed to intercept conversations from older cordless telephones.

4. **Email and Other Internet Communications**
   - Easiest interception is via employers, who can access their own email systems.
   - Email warrants are required for other interceptions.

5. **Use of "Bugs" by Law Enforcement**
   - **On Agent**: Legal as long as the agent has the "right" to be there.
   - **In Suspect's Home or Business**: Requires a warrant.
   - **In Police Car or Jail Cell**: Consideration of expectation of privacy.

#### VI. Fighting Back Against Illegal Searches and Arrests

1. **Exclusionary Rule**
   - Illegally obtained evidence cannot be used in court.

2. **Criminal Law**
   - Prosecuting the officer.

3. **Civil Law**
   - Lawsuits under Section 1983. Attorney fees are paid if you win.

4. **Internal Affairs**
   - Police department discipline, which can include time off, reduction in rank, or termination.
