User: How to conduct system monitoring and log analysis to ensure the normal operation of the system?
Assistant: 1. System monitoring: (1) System basic monitoring: monitor the system's CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network IO, etc., and report to the police in time. (2) Performance monitoring: monitor the performance parameters of each service in the system, such as server response time, processing power, etc., and discover performance problems in a timely manner. (3) Security monitoring: monitor malicious attacks or abnormal login behaviors in the system, and deal with suspicious behaviors in a timely manner. (4) Business monitoring: monitor the business process of the system, monitor the normal business process and abnormal situations of the system, and notify relevant personnel in time to deal with them. 2. Log analysis: (1) Real-time monitoring and collection of system logs: Real-time monitoring of system operation logs through log monitoring software (such as Rizhiyi, Splunk, etc.) or log collection tools that come with the operating system (such as log monitor). (2) Summarize and analyze logs: summarize and analyze logs, and perform operations such as classification, filtering, aggregation, and statistics on system logs. Technologies and algorithms such as data analysis and machine learning can be used to dig out abnormal information and details that can be optimized. (3) Alarm mechanism: Set up a log alarm mechanism. Once abnormal situations and errors occur, relevant personnel will be notified by email, WeChat, telephone, etc. to deal with the problem in a timely manner. (4) Log storage and backup: For log storage and backup, it is best to use distributed storage to store log information on multiple nodes in order to prevent data loss. At the same time, the accidental loss or mishandling of data can be prevented by means of regular backup.
