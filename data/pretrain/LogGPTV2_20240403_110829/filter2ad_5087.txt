Abstract 
This talk overviews some of the highlights and success stories in the mathematical modeling and 
analysis of the Internet (and other networks).  We will begin with Kleinrock’s seminal work on 
modeling store and forward networks and its extensions, and end with the successful development 
of fluid models for the current Internet.  The rest of the talk will focus on lessons learned from 
these endeavors and how modeling and analysis can and will play a role in the development of new 
networks (e.g., wireless networks, application-level networks). Finally, we conclude that one can 
have fun modeling networks while at the same time make a living.
