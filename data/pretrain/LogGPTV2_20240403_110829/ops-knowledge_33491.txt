User: Please check whether there are security risks in the system according to the following network configuration information, and provide relevant solutions. 1. The public IP address is 120.76.72.128, and the SSH port (22), HTTP port (80), RDP port (3389) and MySQL port (3306) are open. \n2. The internal network adopts the network segment of 192.168.0.0/16, and the FTP port (21), SMTP port (25) and SMB port (445) are opened. \n3. Default usernames and passwords are used for network devices, including routers, switches, and servers.
Assistant: There are security risks. The solution is as follows: 1. Firewall: Install a firewall to restrict the ports accessible by public network IP addresses, open only necessary ports, and make security configurations for open ports, such as restricting IP addresses and configuring access control. 2. Password security: Change the default username and password of network devices. It is recommended to use complex passwords containing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special symbols, and change passwords regularly. 3. Protocol security: Encryption protocols are used in the internal network, such as SFTP instead of FTP, SMTPS instead of SMTP, and HTTPS instead of HTTP, etc. 4. Strengthened authentication: Using multi-factor authentication, when the administrator logs in to the device, in addition to entering the correct user name and password, he also needs to use a security token, fingerprint or other more secure authentication methods to improve the security of authentication. 5. Security management: conduct routine vulnerability scanning and security audits on network devices, check logs regularly, and discover and handle security incidents in a timely manner. Train network administrators and users on network security awareness, and establish a sound security management process to improve system security.
