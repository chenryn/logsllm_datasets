##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Feature Idea
##### COMPONENT NAME
The --limit option
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.4.0 (devel ba3295dd3f) last updated 2017/04/12 11:26:36 (GMT +200)
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
One of our developer tried to use one of our playbooks using multiple limits,
thinking it will behave like a `:&` pattern. Having something like:
`ansible-playbook deploy.yml --limit foo --limit bar`
The limit on `foo` was omitted without any warning/error message prompted.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
    $ ansible-playbook deploy.yml --limit foo --limit bar --list-hosts
    # The output will only contain hosts from *bar* group
    $ ansible-playbook deploy.yml --limit "foo:&bar" --list-hosts
    # The output will contain hosts contained in both foo and bar groups
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I think that ansible should, at least, print a warning to mention that one of
the _\--limit_ will be omitted
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
The playbook was run on hosts from the group mentioned in the second _limit_.
