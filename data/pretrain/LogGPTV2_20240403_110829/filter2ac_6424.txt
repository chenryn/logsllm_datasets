When System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled on macOS, certain environment variables are ignored when executing protected binaries. Additionally, third-party applications can utilize Appleâ€™s Hardened Runtime, which enforces restrictions on these environment variables.

Administrators have several options to add further restrictions to applications:
- Setting the `setuid` and/or `setgid` bits.
- Using entitlements.
- Including a `__RESTRICT` segment in the Mach-O binary.

These measures collectively enhance the security of the operating system by limiting the potential for unauthorized modifications and ensuring that only trusted code is executed.
