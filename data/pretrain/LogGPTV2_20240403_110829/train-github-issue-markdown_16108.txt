## Emoji Keyboard Extension
_In Windows 10, we have a special emoji keyboard for whenever we need to add
emoji while writing anything. but it would be great if I don't have to switch
to keyboard. Like suppose if I write :rocket then it should be automatically
turned to emoji ðŸš€ . Same way we use emojis on Github. If we can use this
extension in whole Windows 10 PC ecosystem. It will be great !!. It will be
great of user experience as we do it on mobile platforms such as when we write
some key words that matches to a emoji it suggests us to use an emoji. Using
this extension we can add this feature to Windows PCs._
#### We can do it easily on mac using Rocket app. But I just don't think
there's another way to do it on PC without using emoji keyboard.
