Never rely on a single vendor
Do not get caught up in vendor wars
Ensure that the vendor is 
knowledgeable on the products they 
are selling
Do your own product research
Beware of unnecessary  up-selling
Get details on all aspects ... warranty, 
service , training ....
Do not be afraid to revise your RFQ 
Do not be afraid to READ your RFQ
Keep all paperwork, quotes, and RFQ 
revisions

Prioritize your needs to make a 
balance between budget and 
equipment
Look for hidden costs, cost 
creep, feature creep, and 
after contract expenses
If you work with multiple 
vendors for components of a 
system it is YOUR 
responsibility to ensure that 
the products will work 
together
Know up front if sub-
contracting will happen, and if 
so do due diligence on the sub 
contractors
A high price support contract 
does not always mean high 
quality support

“Of course the 
alarm says it’s 105 
degrees. The sensor 
is on the ceiling, and 
heat rises. It’s 105 up 
there, but down 
here where the 
servers are it’s 
nowhere near 105.”

Know the difference between 
water cooler talk and factual 
discourse. 
Refute with facts, experience, and 
a even tone
Do NOT use personal attacks, 
vulgar insults, or questionable 
phrases or terms
If they start playing the brownie 
points game, stop.
If they start playing politics, 
stop. 
If they cite something they heard 
on AM talk radio, RUN!

Cut sheets from the vendor are 
a better point of reference 
than something told to a 
coworker by their barber who 
heard it from his cousin who 
works on the loading dock 
where the publish that 
technology magazine . 
Do not play buzzword bingo
Know what the terms, 
acronyms, and technological 
phrases you use mean. 
Let them kiss ass, while you kick 
ass.

Know the work schedule for 
the construction team
Meet the foreman. Get his 
contact information.
Read the blueprints.
Read the blueprints again, with 
the foreman.
Supervise the construction. 
Look for things that are not 
quite right. 
Expect to find surprises.
Expect to pay to fix them.

Construction workers and 
their foreman are the first line 
of defense when it comes to 
building inspections.
They know what needs to be 
done, and why. 
They deal with the same state/
county/city building inspectors 
on multiple projects.
Listen to them. Do what they 
say. This is their area of 
expertise, even if the only 
adjective they know is “fucking”
“The fucking wiring is not 
hooked up to the fucking switch 
correctly, so it’s not going to 
fucking work. It’s fucked.” 
    -NJ construction worker

Construction workers on 
your project may not 
speak English. 
If this is a problem , deal 
with it before work 
begins. 
Consult with HR
before bringing up the 
subject.
If you can not 
communicate with each 
other there is no way to 
indicate problems, make 
changes, or share dirty 
jokes
