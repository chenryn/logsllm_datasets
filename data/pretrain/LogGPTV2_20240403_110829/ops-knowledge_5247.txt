We have implemented a simple DynamoDB database that is updated by a remote IoT device. The device does not have a user (e.g., root) constantly logged in. We are experiencing issues with data logging, as the database is not updated unless a user (e.g., root) is logged into the device via an SSH session. 

We have confirmed that the process is running in the background using a Linux service that starts on boot and executes a script. We have verified that the script runs on boot and successfully pushes data to DynamoDB when a user logs in via SSH. Additionally, we have attempted to disassociate the script from a screen session to allow the device to publish data to DynamoDB, but this did not resolve the issue.

Has anyone else encountered this problem? Does Amazon AWS require a user (e.g., root) to be logged in to the device at all times for data to be published to AWS?

**Response:**

No, Amazon AWS does not require a user (e.g., root) to be logged in to the device at all times for data to be published. I have set up a similar configuration, and it works without any issues. 

Are you certain that your IoT device does not enter a sleep mode or some other power-saving state after a while, which could interrupt the data publishing process? It might be worth checking the device's power management settings or any other configurations that could affect its behavior.
