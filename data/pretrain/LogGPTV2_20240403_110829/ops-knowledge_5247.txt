User: We have implemented a simple DynamoDB database that is updated by a remote IoT device that does not have a user (i.e. root) constantly logged in to the device. We have experience issues in logging data as the database is not updated if a user (i.e. root) is not logged into the device (we log in via a ssh session). We are confident that the process is running in the background as we are using a Linux service that runs on bootup to execute a script. We have verified that the script runs on bootup and successfully pushes data to Dynamo upon user log in (via ssh). We have also tried to disassociate a screen session to allow for the device to publish data to Dynamo but this did not seem to fix the issue. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Does amazon AWS require a user (i.e. root) to be logged in to the device at all times in order to allow for data to be published to AWS?
Assistant: No, it does not. I have done similar setup and it is working fine. Are you sure that your IoT device does not go into some kind of sleep mode after a while ?
