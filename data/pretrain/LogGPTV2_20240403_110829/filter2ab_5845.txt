**ATT&CK ID: G0032**
**ATT&CK Technique Name: Lazarus Group**

The Lazarus Group employs a variety of encryption methods to secure their command and control (C2) traffic. Several malware families associated with the Lazarus Group use custom encryption code that combines XOR operations with either an ADD or SUB operation. Another sample of Lazarus Group malware simply uses XOR for C2 traffic encryption. Additionally, some Lazarus Group malware utilizes Caracachs encryption to encrypt C2 payloads. The group has also been known to use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting C2 traffic.[78][79][80][81]
