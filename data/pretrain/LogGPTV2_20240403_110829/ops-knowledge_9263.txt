Subject: Query on Sending Multiple Images in a Single GET Request for a Social Network Application

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently developing a social network application using Google App Engine, and I have encountered a challenge that I would like to seek your advice on.

In my application, when a user loads their page, they should be able to see all images associated with their account. The server-side code is written in Python, and I plan to use JavaScript/jQuery on the client side to decode and display these images. My goal is to perform a single query on the server side to retrieve all images related to a specific user, and then send these images to the client as a single unit. On the client side, I will break down this unit into individual images for display.

My initial thought was to use JSON for this purpose. However, it seems that while JSON can handle multiple "objects" within a single response, it does not support sending multiple binary files (such as images) in one go. 

Could you please advise if there is an alternative approach or technology that would allow me to achieve my objective of sending multiple images to the client in response to a single GET request? Alternatively, if you believe that my current approach might not be the most efficient or effective, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you may have for a better solution.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Alexander
