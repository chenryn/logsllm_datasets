the attacker may learn yt by placing a sensing device in the
proximity of the receiver. For the sake of presentation, we
call this device the symbol sensor. It records the symbols
received from the transmitter and reports them to the attacker
through any available communication channel. Note that the
characteristic of the wireless channel becomes uncorrelated
every half a carrier wavelength over distance [20]. Normally,
the symbol sensor would be placed within a range of half a
carrier wavelength away from the receiver (e.g., for a 2.4 GHz
signal, its wavelength equals to 12.5 cm). Thus, the symbols
that the symbol sensor receives are roughly the same as those
received by the receiver, and can be used as yt .
The attacker can also use the mathematical model
yt = ht ∗ x + n to derive yt, where ht is the link signature
between the transmitter and the receiver. Speciﬁcally, the sym-
bol sensor can receive symbols from the transmitter, estimate
the link signature from these symbols, and report the link
signature to the attacker. The attacker can use the reported
link signature as an approximation of ht to calculate yt . In this
case, the symbol sensor only needs to report the derived link
signatures from time to time, and the attacker can calculate yt
directly by using the estimated link signature ht rather than
wait for the sensor to report yt .
C. Manipulating Transmitted Symbols
The symbols ya received from the attacker can be repre-
sented as ya = ha ∗ xa + na, where xa, ha, and na are the
symbols transmitted by the attacker, the link signature of the
attacker, and the channel noise, respectively. To make ya equal
to yt , the attacker can treat xa as a unknown variable, and solve
it from the equation ha ∗xa+na = yt , where link signature ha
of the attacker can be obtained from the symbol sensor as
well. For previous wireless link signature based authentication
schemes [1]–[6], the channel impulse response is assumed to
be unchanged in a short time or change slowly. Similarly,
we assume that the attacker’s link signature does not change
between obtaining the attacker’s link signature and launching
the mimicry attack. The solution to this equation enables ya
to be similar to or the same as the transmitter’s symbols yt .
As a result, the link signatures that are estimated from ya will
also be close to those estimated from yt .
Let xa = [xa1, xa2, . . . , xa M]T denote the symbols trans-
mitted by the attacker, and ha = [ha1, ha2, . . . , ha L]T denote
the link signature of the attacker. We have
yt = ha ∗ xa + na = Xaha + na

Therefore, yt = ha ∗xa +na ⇔ yt = Haxa+na. We can solve
xa from yt = Haxa + na. Since na is unknown, we use the
standard least square approach [18] to solve xa. Speciﬁcally,
we minimizes ||yt − Haˆxa||2, where ˆxa is the approximate
solution of xa. The minimization yields

a yt .
ˆxa = (HH

Elements in xa are already physical layer symbols, and thus
they can be transmitted directly. The attacker does not need
to modulate them again for transmission.
D. Extending Attack to Multiple Tone Probing
Based Link Signature
There are two other link signature schemes [6], [9] besides
the one we just attacked [5]. The scheme in [9], referred to as

the multiple tone probing based link signature, uses complex
gain at different frequencies to build a link signature, and the
scheme in [6] is an integration of the techniques in [5] and [9].
In the following, we show that we can extend the mimicry
attack to also compromise the multiple tone probing based
link signature, thus making all existing link signature schemes
vulnerable.
In multiple tone probing, K carrier waves are simultane-
is s(t) = (cid:8)
ously transmitted to the receiver, and the transmitted signal

κ=1 e j 2π fκt [6], [9], where fκ is the frequency
of the κ-th carrier. Each carrier wave undergoes an attenua-
r (t) = (cid:8)
tion at its center frequency [6]. Thus, the received signal is
K
κ=1 Hκe j 2π f κt , where Hκ is the complex channel
gain that reﬂects the amount of attenuation on the κ-th carrier
wave. The vector h = [H1, H2, . . . , HK] of the complex
channel gain is used as the link signature [6], [9].

As a result, the multiple tone link signature estimated from
ra(t) is the same as that estimated from rt (t).
Since the link signature scheme in [6] is essentially an
integration of the scheme in [5] and [9], the above result also
makes the scheme in [6] vulnerable to mimicry attacks.

In a successful mimicry attack, both Equations (4) and (5) are

(cid:6)
unknown variable Xa, and h

from each other due to the spatial uncorrelation property of
wireless channels [15]. Thus, these two equations form an
overdetermined linear system. In such a system, it is infeasible
for the attacker to ﬁnd an exact solution of Xa to make
Equations (4) and (5) hold at the same time.

Hence, when the receiver utilizes two antennas to coopera-
tively authenticate the transmitter, the attacker with only one
antenna may fail to launch the mimicry attack. This implies
that extra antennas at the receiver can help to mitigate the
mimicry attack.
IV. MIMICRY ATTACKS AGAINST MIMO
B. Mimicry Attacks With Two Antennas
One may wonder whether the mimicry attack still works
in MIMO wireless communication systems. To answer this
question, we ﬁrst explore a simple communication scenario,
where the receiver has multiple antennas while the attacker
just owns one antenna.
A. Mimicry Attacks With One Antenna
As shown in Figure 2, the receiver is equipped with two
receive antennas (antennas A and B). The link signatures
between the transmitter and the two antennas of the receiver
are h1 and h2 respectively. There also exists an attacker, who
launches the mimicry attack to impersonate the transmitter.

Assume that the attacker knows the link signatures h

between himself and the two antennas of the receiver, respec-
tively. The attacker can learn these link signatures before
launching the mimicry attack via multiple methods, such as
In this section, we investigate the feasibility of
the
mimicry attack when the attacker and the receiver both have
two antennas, and we discover that the mimicry attack is
feasible in such MIMO systems.
As shown in Figure 3, the receiver has antenna A and
antenna B, and the attacker has antenna 1 and antenna 2. Thus,
there exist 4 pairs of antennas and we denote the corresponding
link signatures by h1a, h1b, h2a and h2b. If the mimicry attack
is successful, for antenna A, we can get
Xa1h1a + Xa2h2a = Xh1,
(6)
where Xa1 and Xa2 are the Teoplitz matrices of the sequences
xa1, xa2 transmitted by antenna 1 and antenna 2, respectively.
Likewise, for antenna B, we have
Xa1h1b + Xa2h2b = Xh2.

C. Mimicry Attacks in General Scenarios
We further extend the previous result to a general situ-
ation, where the receiver has P antennas to cooperatively
authenticate the transmitter and the attacker has Q antennas to
launch the mimicry attack. Assume the chosen link signatures
that
the attacker would like to mimic are represented by
h1, h2, . . . , hP , and the attacker’s real link signature between
the antenna of the attacker and the antenna of the receiver is
denoted as hi j , where i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , P} and j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , Q}.
Thus, we have
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
H11xa1 + H21xa2 + ··· + HQ1xa Q = Xh1
H12xa1 + H22xa2 + ··· + HQ2xa Q = Xh2
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
H1Pxa1 + H2Pxa2 + ··· + HQ Pxa Q = XhP ,
...
where xa1, xa2,···, xa Q are sequences transmitted by the
attacker’s Q antennas. Note that the matrix H j i must be full
rank. Thus, we can see that Q should be equal to or larger
than P in order to solve the transmit sequences from (10).

and xai has an inﬁnite number of solutions.
