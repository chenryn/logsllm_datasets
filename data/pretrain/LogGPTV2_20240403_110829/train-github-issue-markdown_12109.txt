### What you think should happen instead
No idea as the same DAG was running fine in another composer in same project.
We just copied this DAG from there and ran first time in order to migrate the
DAG to this composer.
### How to reproduce
Copy a DAG with Big Query operator from one composer to another running in
same project and start running it.
### Operating System
Ubuntu
### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
Big Query Operator related
### Deployment
Google Cloud Composer
### Deployment details
Airflow on Google Cloud Composer 2.1.3
### Anything else
NA
