### Expected Behavior
The same DAG was running without issues in another Composer environment within the same project. We copied the DAG from there and ran it for the first time in this Composer environment to migrate it.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Copy a DAG that uses the BigQuery operator from one Composer environment to another within the same project.
2. Start running the copied DAG.

### Operating System
Ubuntu

### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
- BigQuery Operator related

### Deployment
Google Cloud Composer

### Deployment Details
- Airflow on Google Cloud Composer 2.1.3
