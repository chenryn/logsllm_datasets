Waiting actions are elements that are blocked for any reason. I use the `WAITING` TODO keyword to track this state. Under each element you should add that reason and optionally the process you want to follow to unblock it.
If you need to actively track the evolution of the WAITING status, leave it on the top of your `todo`. Otherwise set the date you want to check its status and move it to the `ticker.org` file. If you don't even want to track it, move it to the `someday.org` file.
### Tickler management
The tickler is a system where you postpone actions to a specific date, but not with a calendar mindset where the action **needs** to be done at that date. With the tickler you schedule the action to enter your inbox that day to decide what are you going to do with it.
To implement this in orgmode you can add the `:tickler:` tag to any element that is tracked in the agenda files and once a day you can look at the day's agenda and decide what to do with the action. It's important though that whatever you do with it, you have to remove it from the agenda view in order to only keep the elements that you need to do in the day. You can follow this workflow by:
- Opening the agenda view `gaa` 
- Go to the view of the day `vd`
- Go to today `.`
- Search by tickler `/tickler`
It can also help to review in the weeklies all the ticklers of the week to avoid surprises.
If you want to make the project go away from your `todo` or `someday` until the tickler date, move it to the `tickler.org` file.
#### Soft recurrent tasks
There are some tasks that have a soft recurrence meaning that once you do them you don't want them to show up in your list of actions until a specific time has passed. You could use a recurrent `DEADLINE` or `SCHEDULED` but as we've seen earlier that will clutter your calendar pretty soon. Try following the next workflow with these tasks:
- Add the `:soft_recurrence:` tag to keep them tracked.
- Add them to the tickler file with a recurrent appointment date `` and the `:tickler:` tag so that it doesn't show up in the agenda view even if you move it to another file.
- When the appointed day comes you'll review the tickler elements as part of your day's routine. If you think it's time to do it, refile it to the `todo.org` file, if not, adjust the recurrence period and set the next date. Even though this workflow is reproducing the "kick the can forward" that we want to avoid, the idea is that once you get the period right you'll never have to do it again. If you see that after some iterations the period keeps on changing, maybe this workflow is not working for that kind of task and you may need to think of a better system `¯\(°_o)/¯`.
- Once you complete the item, the new one will be spawned, once it has refile it to the tickler file again.
We use appointments instead of `DEADLINE` or `SCHEDULED` so that they don't clutter the tickler view if you don't do them on the appointment date. 
Another option is not to archive the DONE tasks and in the weekly reset them to TODO the ones that you want to do the next week.
### Setting up your filing system
You will resist the whole process of capturing information if your reference systems are not fast, functional, and fun. Thus you need to envision a system at hand that supports both physical and digital content. Without a streamlined system for both, you will resist keeping potentially valuable information, or what you do keep will accumulate in inappropriate places. 
We’re concerned here mostly with general-reference filing, anything that you want to keep for its interesting or useful data or purpose and that doesn’t fit into your specialized filing systems and won’t stand up by itself on a shelf. For example articles, brochures, pieces of paper, notes, printouts, documents, and even physical things like tickets, keys, buyers-club membership cards, and flash drives.
It should take you less than one minute to pick something up out of your in-tray, decide it needs no next action but has some potential future value, and finish storing it in a trusted system. If it takes longer, you’ll likely stack it or stuff it somewhere instead. Besides being fast, the system needs to be fun and easy, current and complete. Otherwise you’ll unconsciously resist emptying your in-tray because you know there’s likely to be something in there that ought to get filed, and you won’t even want to look at the papers or your clogged e-mail. If you have to get up every time you have some ad hoc piece of paper you want to file, or you have to search multiple places on your computer for an appropriate location for a piece of information you want to keep, you’ll tend to stack it or leave it in its original place instead of filing it.
You must feel equally comfortable about filing a single piece of paper on a new topic, even a scribbled note, in its own file as you would about filing a more formal, larger document.
Whatever you need to do to get your reference system to that quick and easy standard for everything it has to hold, do it. For example purge your files at least once a year, that keeps it from going stale and becoming the dreaded black hole- .
### Digital general reference
It is very helpful to have a visual map sorted in ways that make sense, either by indexes or data groups organized effectively, usually in an alphabetic order.
The biggest issue for digitally oriented people is that the ease of capturing and storing has generated a write-only syndrome: all they’re doing is capturing information—not actually accessing and using it intelligently. Some consciousness needs to be applied to keep one’s potentially huge digital library functional, versus a black hole of data easily dumped in there with a couple of keystrokes.
You need to consistently check how much room to give yourself so that the content remains meaningfully and easily accessible, without creating a black hole of an inordinate amount of information amorphously organized. 
### Physical general reference
One idea is to have one system/place where you order the content alphabetically, not multiple ones. People have a tendency to want to use their files as a personal management system, and therefore they attempt to organize them in groupings by projects or areas of focus. This magnifies geometrically the number of places something isn’t when you forget where you filed it.
## Capture all your stuff
The focus of this process is to capture *everything* that has your attention, otherwise some part of you will still not totally trust that you're working with the whole picture. While you're doing it, create a list of all the sources of inputs in your world. 
What you're going to do is methodically go through each piece of your life and search for anything that doesn’t permanently belong where it is, the way it is, and put it into your in-tray. You’ll be gathering things that are incomplete or things that have some decision about potential action tied to them. They all go into your “inbox”, so they’ll be available for later processing. If it's immediately evident that you don't need the stuff trash it.
Be patient, this process may take between 1 and 6 hours, and at the end you'll have a huge pile of stuff in your inbox. You might be scared and get the thought of "what am I doing with my life?", but don't worry you'll get everything in order soon :).
### Define what is going to be your in-tray
To be able to store all the "stuff" that needs to be dealt with you need to define what is your in-tray going to be, some suggestions are:
* A clear room: Make some space somewhere at the location you're going to do the gathering to pile physical stuff
* A physical or digital list.
### Physical gathering
The first activity is to search your physical environment. The best way to create a clean decision about whether something should go into the in-tray is to understand clearly what shouldn’t go in. Here are the four categories of things that can remain where they are, the way they are, with no action tied to them:
* Supplies: Anything you need to keep because you use it regularly. 
* Reference Material: Anything you simply keep for information as needed. This category includes manuals, all your telephone and address information, any material relevant to projects, themes, and topics. It also includes books and magazines that you may be keeping as a library.
* Decoration.
* Equipment: Your phone, computer, printer, wastebasket, furniture, clock, chargers, pens, and notepads.
Everything else goes into your inbox. But many of the things you might initially interpret as supplies, reference, decoration, or equipment could also have action associated with them because they still aren’t exactly the way they need to be.
As you engage in the capturing step, you may run into one or more of the following problems:
* An item is too big to go in the in-tray: create a post it that represents it or add it as an entry in your digital inbox. If you can, add the date too
* The pile is too big to fit the in-tray: Create visually distinct stacks around the in-tray, even on the floor.
* Doubts whether to trash something: When in doubt keep it, you'll decide about it later when you process the in-tray. What you need to avoid is to get caught up in deciding what to do with the element. That's going to be the next step in the process, let's go one at a time.
* Getting caught up in cleaning and organizing: If it doesn't take that long it's fine but remember the purpose of this process and the fact that we want to finish it as soon as possible. If you discover things you want to change, add them to the in-tray.
* If you encounter stuff that is already on lists and organizers, treat them as everything else in the "in".
Now that the process it's clear let's start.
Start with the space where you actually do stuff, scan the place centimeter by centimeter with the mindset defined above, check your desk, drawers, floors, walls, shelves, equipment, furniture, fixtures...Then repeat the process with each room of your home.
### Mental gathering
Once you already have a nice pile of stuff, think of what has your attention that isn’t represented by something already in your in-tray and record each thought, each idea, each project or thing that occurs you and add it to the inbox.
To assist in clearing your head, you may want to review the following the next trigger list, item by item, to see if you’ve forgotten anything.
