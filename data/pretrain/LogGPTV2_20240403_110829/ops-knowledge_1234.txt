User: Simple question:
I have a python program which launches an executable.
The launcher uses optparse module to setup the run and lauch the binary through shell.
Is it possible to bundle the laucher and the binary into a single package?
Platform of interest is Linux.
Assistant: using pyinstaller for example you could add the executable file as a resource file, it extracts the resources to a temp folder, from there you can access your resource files as you want
