Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of running tasks in stage 12 and 13. The python.PythonRunner reported a total time of 40, with a boot time of -156, init time of 196, and finish time of 0. The executor.Executor reported that it finished tasks 0.0, 3.0, 4.0, 1.0, and 2.0 in stage 12.0, and then got assigned tasks 528, 542, 553, 558, and 559 in stage 13.0. The broadcast.TorrentBroadcast started reading broadcast variable 22, and the storage.MemoryStore stored blocks broadcast_22_piece0 and broadcast_22 in memory. The reading of broadcast variable 22 took 11 ms.
