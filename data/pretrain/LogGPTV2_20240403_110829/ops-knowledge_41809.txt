I'm currently using Appium-Python with AWS Device Farm and have noticed that the tests are executed in a random order. Since my tests are partially dependent on each other, I need to find a way to ensure that AWS runs them in a specific order. 

Do you have any suggestions on how I can achieve this?

I work for the AWS Device Farm team, and although this may be an older thread, I'd like to provide a solution that will be helpful for others in the future.

AWS Device Farm parses and executes the tests in a random order. For Appium Python, this order is determined by the output of `pytest --collect-only`. As a result, the execution order may vary across different test runs.

Currently, the only way to enforce a specific test order is to create a new test that sequentially calls all the individual tests in the desired sequence. While this approach may not be the most elegant, it is the only method available at present to guarantee the order of test execution.

We are actively working on improving the alignment between your local environment and AWS Device Farm, and you can expect more enhancements in the coming weeks.
