User: I wish to convert a bash script that's currently using "curl -b 'cookie'" into a Python script. I've looked at Pycurl, but I couldnt' find a -b equivalent. There are also urllib and urllib2, but I couldn't see an easy way to replicate the line.
Any help would be great.
Assistant: You can use CookieJar.add_cookie_header to add your cookie to a http request header.
