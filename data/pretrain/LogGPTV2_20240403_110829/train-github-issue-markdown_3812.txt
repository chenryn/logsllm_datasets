In IE8 (8.0.7601.17514), showing a modal then showing a second modal either
crashes the browser or causes a "stack overflow on line 0" error.
Jsfiddle here.
(Jsfiddle doesn't work with IE8 though, so to reproduce you will will need to
plonk it somewhere local & open in IE8.)
Bootstrap: 2.3.1  
JQuery: 1.9.1
