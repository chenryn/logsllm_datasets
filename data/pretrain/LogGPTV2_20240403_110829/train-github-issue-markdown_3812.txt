In Internet Explorer 8 (version 8.0.7601.17514), displaying a modal and subsequently opening a second one often results in either a browser crash or a "stack overflow on line 0" error.

To reproduce this issue, please note that the provided jsFiddle link is not compatible with IE8. Instead, you will need to download the code and run it locally in an IE8 environment.

- **Bootstrap Version:** 2.3.1
- **jQuery Version:** 1.9.1
