### Addressing Use-After-Free in Email Aliases

To effectively mitigate use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities, a comprehensive solution is to completely eliminate the reuse of resource identifiers. For example, Google and Rambler.ru do not release resource identifiers after users delete their accounts. Instead, these identifiers are marked as invalid, making it impossible for attackers to exploit them. Therefore, our primary recommendation is that providers should adopt this practice and permanently mark once-registered email aliases as unavailable.

#### Additional Security Measures

In addition to the above, services can implement mechanisms to block UAF attacks. First, requiring knowledge of the user ID or username in addition to the password significantly complicates password recovery, thereby limiting the automation potential of such attacks. Second, services should offer and encourage the use of two-factor authentication (2FA). Many of the attacks we performed during the exploitation phase (see Section 7) would have been thwarted by 2FA. However, 2FA is not a complete solution, as outdated email addresses may still be used for communication purposes.

#### Challenges with Free-Mail Providers

A persistent issue is that free-mail providers may go out of business, selling their domains and deleting all associated email aliases. This problem also extends to private and corporate mail servers where domain expiration occurs. In such cases, attackers can still exploit the situation as described in Section 5.

#### Regular Verification of Email Addresses

Another approach to secure users against UAF is to regularly verify the existence of a user’s email address. This can be done using techniques similar to those proposed by Caballero et al. [10] for detecting dangling pointers. Web services could employ methods like sending periodic emails (e.g., newsletters, invoices) to users. If an email account is expired, delivery will fail, and a bounce reply will be generated. Services should automatically parse bounce replies to detect invalid email addresses and disallow password or account recovery through such addresses. The Certified Senders Alliance [11] also pursues a similar approach.

#### Tracking User Activity

Another method is to track user activity through unique links included in sent emails, such as newsletters or invoices. When a user clicks on these links, the server can confirm that the email account is still active. If there is no activity over a certain period, an additional verification email can be sent to re-validate the email address.

### Recommendations for Users

Some users in our case study allowed their free-mail addresses to expire or deleted them in response to database leaks, unaware that this increases their vulnerability to UAF attacks. We recommend that users keep unused free-mail addresses to prevent such attacks. Additionally, users should review and update their email addresses across all web services they have registered with. However, this process is prone to human error, and forgetting to update even a few services can leave users susceptible to UAF attacks.

Enabling 2FA can significantly enhance account security, but this requires support from the web service provider, as discussed in Section 8.2.

### UAF on Non-Public Providers

UAF is not limited to free or public mail providers; it also affects non-public providers. During our investigations, we found an incident where the official Twitter account of a national political party was referencing an invalid email address on a non-public mail host. This could have been exploitable by registering as a new party member and choosing the same email alias. The issue was quickly resolved after we informed the party.

### Ethical Considerations

Working with sensitive user data raises ethical concerns. Although our institution does not have an ethics board, we took several steps to address these concerns:
1. We did not perform experiments on email addresses obtained from leaks, only on those provided by voluntary participants.
2. Personal data was visible only to two of the authors, while others had access to anonymized information.
3. All non-anonymized data was deleted upon completion of the study.
4. Participants provided their data voluntarily and were informed of their right to revoke permission and leave the study at any time.
5. Any security or privacy issues found were immediately addressed, and participants were advised on how to protect their accounts, including enabling 2FA and updating their email addresses on web services.

### Responsible Disclosure

We initiated responsible disclosure with five free-mail providers and five websites to implement the fixes we proposed in Section 8.2. All parties responded promptly and acknowledged the general problem. The responses were categorized as follows:
- **Helpful:** The national automobile club agreed to integrate some of the countermeasures we proposed.
- **Informative:** Yahoo, Amazon, and Dropbox stated that they are continuously working on improving their security measures.
- **Irrelevant:** Mail.ru and Microsoft indicated that the responsibility lies with the users to update their references, not with the providers.

### Conclusion

This paper demonstrates that UAF is a more general and widespread phenomenon than previously known. We introduced a new generalization of UAF and showed its application in the context of UAFMail attacks, which gather free-mail addresses from online database leaks. Our fully-automated quantitative analysis revealed that 33.5% of the tested free-mail addresses were no longer valid. In two user studies with 100 and 31 participants, 11–19% of users were affected by our attack. We provided a list of immediate and long-term recommendations for mail providers, web service providers, and users to prevent UAF exploitation.
