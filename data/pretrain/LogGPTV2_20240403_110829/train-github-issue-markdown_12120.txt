### Incorporating Facebook-Like Links in the Navbar

To enhance the user experience, I have integrated two Facebook-like links into the navigation bar (navbar). These links provide quick access to the "Shopping Cart" and "Messages" functionalities. Here is a visual representation of how these links appear in the navbar:

- **Shopping Cart**: Displays the number of items in the cart (e.g., 3).
- **Messages**: Shows the number of unread messages (e.g., 10).

### Responsive Menu

In the responsive menu, these links are displayed as follows:

This design ensures that the links are easily accessible and visually consistent across different screen sizes.
