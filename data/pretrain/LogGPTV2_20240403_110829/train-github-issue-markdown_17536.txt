Initial window height is off by titlebar height. This got regressed by #3394
in:
terminal/src/cascadia/WindowsTerminal/AppHost.cpp
Lines 197 to 210 in 357e835
|  RECT islandFrame = {};  
---|---  
|  bool succeeded = AdjustWindowRectExForDpi(&islandFrame,
WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, false, 0, dpix);  
|  // If we failed to get the correct window size for whatever reason, log  
|  // the error and go on. We'll use whatever the control proposed as the  
|  // size of our window, which will be at least close.  
|  LOG_LAST_ERROR_IF(!succeeded);  
|  
|  if (_useNonClientArea)  
|  {  
|  islandFrame.top = -NonClientIslandWindow::topBorderVisibleHeight;  
|  }  
|  
|  adjustedWidth = -islandFrame.left \+ islandWidth + islandFrame.right;  
|  adjustedHeight = -islandFrame.top \+ islandHeight + islandFrame.bottom;  
That also blocks #3181 which relys on this size calculation.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Set `fontSize` to 50
  2. Set `initialRows` to 2
  3. Launch terminal
# Expected behavior
2 rows should fit in the window
# Actual behavior
About 1.5 of a row fits.
