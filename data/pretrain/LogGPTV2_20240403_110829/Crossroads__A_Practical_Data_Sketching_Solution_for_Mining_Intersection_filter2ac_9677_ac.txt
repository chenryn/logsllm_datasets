Numerical Illustration: For instance, assume that the in-
tersection of the two streams only has 1% of the value of both
A and B (i.e., γA = γB = 0.01). Then, if we use just 100,000
counters per sketch, the variance-to-mean-square ratio is 0.1
– small enough to get under 10% error with high probability.
3.3 Intersection Algorithms for estimating M0
and M1
The zero-th moment M0 indicates the number of distinct
elements in a stream. Ordinarily, this quantity can be triv-
ially tracked using just one counter for a single stream, but
this trivial solution does not allow for the estimation of M0
of the intersection of two streams. However, the above-
mentioned intersection technique for estimating M2 can be
modiﬁed slightly to estimate M0 of the intersection of two
streams. We simply replace the term “pkt.V” in line 3 of
the second routine in Algorithm 2 by the value 1. The
M0 estimator for the intersection is simply (cid:99)M0(SA(cid:84) B) =
2 ·{M0(SA⊕B)− M0(SA)− M0(SB)}. Note this simple mod-
iﬁcation works for M0 estimation only in this special case,
where every packet is a “singleton” ﬂow.

In the second equality, for all i (cid:54)= j we know that si and
sj are independent, so E[sisj] = E[si] · E[sj] = 0 and all
but the ﬁrst term disappear. Also note that s2
i = 1 as each
si ∈ {1,−1}, leading to the simpliﬁcation of the ﬁrst term.
Thus, (cid:98)Y is an unbiased estimator for M2(SA∩B).
To estimate the average RTT, we need also to estimate
the ﬁrst moment M1, which is the sum of all the RT T val-
ues of the packets in a stream.
It turns out that the M2
intersection technique can again be slightly modiﬁed to suit
our need. We simply replace the term “pkt.V” by its square
root and the estimator remains the same as in the M2 case.
227are all 10T 2, and their pairwise covariances Cov[SA, SB],
Cov[SB, SC ], Cov[SA, SC ] are all equal to 4qT 2. Note that
4q is exactly the size of pairwise intersections |A∩C|, |A∩B|
and |B∩C|. Thus these 3 random variables SA, SB, SC have
a joint Gaussian distribution with the covariance matrix:

sketches.
Again, this simple modiﬁcation works only in this special
case, where every packet is a “singleton” ﬂow. Otherwise, we
would have to resort to much more expensive techniques such
as the Cauchy distribution sketch proposed by Indyk [10].
The algorithms and analysis are very similar to the case for
M2 and are omitted here for brevity.
4. AN IMPOSSIBILITY RESULT ON 3-WAY
INTERSECTION
In this section, we prove a claim stated earlier that, with
Tug-of-War algorithm, it is impossible to generalize this 2-
way intersection scheme to a 3-way (or higher) scheme. Note
that in the Tug-of-War sketch, the ﬁnal value of each counter
is the result of a long random walk, which is known to be
very close to Gaussian. This property will be used in the
proof. Recall that our scheme uses Tug-of-War for estimat-
ing all three quantities (M0, M1, M2) of interest, and is
therefore governed by this impossibility result. Although it
is possible to circumvent this impossibility using other types
of sketches (e.g., the stable distribution sketches [10] other
than the Gaussian one), they are in general much more ex-
pensive than the Tug-of-War sketch.
Intriguing as our claim is, its proof is in fact quite straight-
forward. Suppose three Tug-of-War sketches SA, SB, and SC
– each of which consists of the same number of counters –
are used to summarize three data sets A, B, and C respec-
tively. Since counter values in each sketch is i.i.d., without
loss of generality it suﬃces to prove the case in which there
is only one counter in each sketch (i.e., one random vari-
able in each random vector). In the following, we will create
two sets (of data sets) {A1, B1, C1} and {A2, B2, C2} so
that the random vectors (cid:104)SA1 , SB1 , SC1(cid:105) and (cid:104)SA2 , SB2 , SC2(cid:105)
have identical joint (approximately Gaussian) distributions,
but |A1 ∩ B1 ∩ C1| and |A2 ∩ B2 ∩ C2| are very diﬀerent
in value. However, since any estimator of the 3-way inter-
section is necessarily a function of the joint distribution of
these three sketches, this estimator cannot estimate both
3-way intersections accurately.
First consider scenario 1 in Figure 3. All three sets, A,
B, and C, contain 10q packets each. Note that though their
sizes are the same, A, B and C are distinct sets of packets.
Let us assume that all the values for all packets have the
same value T . In this scenario, the sketches produced from
the three sets are three random variables (there is only one
counter in each sketch as explained earlier) SA, SB, SC . As
explained before, when q is large, the marginal distribution
of each random variable is Gaussian, and they have a joint
Gaussian distribution. The variance of the three sketches
It can be easily veriﬁed that in scenario 2 these 3 random
variables also have a joint Gaussian distribution, and have
the same covariance matrix. Since the covariance matrix
uniquely determines a joint Gaussian distribution, these two
random vectors have the same joint probability distribution
in both scenarios. However, the size of 3-way intersection
in these two scenarios are 3qT 2 and 2qT 2 respectively. This
means that there is at least 33% relative error in estimating
one of these values.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
In this section, we describe several important implemen-
tation issues with the data sketches and their cost and per-
formance ramiﬁcations if applicable.
1. Intersection Ratio. We deﬁne the intersection ratio
(IR) of the sets A and B as follows:
