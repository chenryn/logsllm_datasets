which excludes the self-routed jobs (i.e., 𝑗 = 𝑖) that naturally
do not decrease 𝑛𝑖 + 1 to 𝑛𝑖. The opposite ﬂux 𝐺 needs to
increase the queue-length of queue 𝑖 to 𝑛𝑖 + 1. Transitions
towards states where 𝑖 has 𝑛𝑖 +1 are allowed provided that the
following conditions hold: the sending queue 𝑗 is not empty
and if 𝑗 = 𝑓, 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑(m) ∕= 𝑖 so that a simultaneous transition
does not happen. The ﬂux 𝐺 represents all transitions from
queue 𝑗 to 𝑖, 𝑗 ∕= 𝑖.

Consider now the special case 𝑖 = 𝑓. The ﬂux 𝐹 (since it
includes all possible transitions from queue 𝑓 to any queue 𝑗)
can be simpliﬁed as follows:

Similarly, the opposite ﬂux 𝐺 that describes all transitions that

𝑓  𝐹𝑖. Differently from BAS, there is no
need for tracking the order of blocking by the list 𝒎, since
a job that cannot be delivered is simply re-executed without
blocking the sender queue activity. Thus, the QR marginal
probabilities are immediately expressed in the RS-RD case as
𝜋(𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗), where the 𝒎 list is no longer used being
always 𝒎 = ∅. As stated earlier, we consider throughout this
section the general case where several queues may have ﬁnite
capacity, i.e., 𝐹𝑖 0
𝑘𝑗 =1𝑝𝑖𝑗𝜋(𝑛𝑖, 𝑘, 𝐹𝑗, 𝑘𝑗)
)

where the ﬁrst term sums to the utilization of queue 𝑖 in phase
𝑘𝑖, while the other summations represent the probability of
observing the destination station 𝑗 full. The basic characteri-
zation of the RS-RD state space holds similarly for the BAS
case except for the formulas where the effective utilization is
involved, i.e., Theorem 1 that is here extended to the RS-RD
case. Due to limited space we report only proof outlines since
the general ideas behind the RS-RD proofs are qualitatively
similar to the ones used in [5] for the non-blocking case.
Theorem 6: The utilization levels of queue 𝑖 in its 𝐾𝑖
phases are in equilibrium, i.e., for each phase 𝑘, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝐾𝑖,
