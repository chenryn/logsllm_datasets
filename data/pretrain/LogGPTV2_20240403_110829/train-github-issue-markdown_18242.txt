# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.4.2382.0
    Any other software?
    Powershell 6.2.1 or Powershell 5.1
    R 3.6.1
# Steps to reproduce
Open a R session then type any expression and evaluate it. Then the up arrow
should retrieve older commands in the history.
# Expected behavior
The up arrow should retrieve older commands in the history.
# Actual behavior
The up arrow does nothing, even if the R history is in an expected state as
showed by the `history()` function.
This bug occurs only in "Windows based" terminal, such as powershell and cmd,
executed by Windows Terminal. This bug does not exist if R is run inside the
_old_ terminal. This bug does not exist either if R is running inside a ssh
session inside powershell.
