The total maximum number of iterations is limited to at most 𝐺
iterations. However, if a successful robust adversarial example is
created before the maximum number of iterations is reached, the
algorithm does not need to continue. To efficiently calculate adver-
sarial examples, we use an RIR ℎtest to simulate the over-the-air
scenario during the calculation to verify whether the example has
already achieved over-the-air robustness. This RIR is only used for
verification and can, for example, be drawn out of 𝐻𝜃 once at the
beginning of the algorithm.
The entire approach is summarized with Algorithm 1. As can be
seen, the psychoacoustic hearing thresholds Φ are optionally used
during the gradient descent to limit modifications of the signal to
those time-frequency ranges, where they are (mostly) imperceptible.
Here, DNN0 describes the augmented DNN (“Feature extraction”
and “DNN”) in Figure 3 without the RIR simulation since, for the
algorithm, this is replaced by the simulated RIR ℎtest.
4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
In the following, we evaluate the performance of the proposed al-
gorithm for adversarial examples played over-the-air and compare
the performance for varying reverberation times, distances, and ad-
versarial examples restricted by psychoacoustic hearing thresholds.
Additionally, we compare the generic approach with an adapted
version of the attack where an attacker has prior knowledge of the
target room. Finally, we measure the changes of generic adversarial
examples replayed in different rooms and, even if there is no direct
line-of-sight between the microphone and the speaker.
For a practical demonstration of the attack, exemplary adver-
sarial examples are available online at http://imperio.adversarial-
attacks.net.
4.1 Metrics
We use the following standard measures to assess the quality of the
computed adversarial examples.
4.1.1 Word Error Rate. To measure performance, we use the word
error rate (WER) with respect to the target transcription. For its
computation, the standard metric for this purpose, the Levenshtein
distance [23] L, is used, summing up the number of deleted 𝐷,
inserted 𝐼, and substituted 𝑆 words for the best possible alignment
between target text and recognition output. The Levenshtein dis-
tance is finally divided by the total number of words 𝑁 to obtain
𝑊 𝐸𝑅 = 100 · L
𝑁
= 100 · 𝐷 + 𝐼 + 𝑆
𝑁
.

For a real attack, an adversarial example can only be considered
successful if a WER of 0 % is achieved (i.e., the hypothesis of the
system matches with the attacker chosen target transcription).
Segmental Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The segmental signal-to-
4.1.2
noise ratio (SNRseg) measures the amount of noise 𝜎 added from
an attacker to the original signal 𝑥 and is computed as
𝑥 2(𝑡)

where 𝑇 is the segment length and 𝐾 the number of segments. Thus,
the higher the SNRseg, the less noise was added.
In contrast to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the SNRseg [35]
is computed frame-wise and gives a better assessment of an audio
signal if the original and the added noise are aligned [38] as it is
the case in our experiments.
4.2 Calculation Time
All experiments were performed on a machine with an Intel Xeon
Gold 6130 CPU and 128 GB of DDR4 memory.
For our experiments, we limit the maximum number of iterations
to 2000 since in every iteration more distortions are added to the
audio file, which decreases the audio quality of the adversarial
examples. Also, this number is sufficient for the attack to converge,
as can be seen in Figure 8, where the WER is plotted as a function
of the maximum numbers of iterations 𝐺.
Computing an adversarial example for 10 seconds of audio with
the maximum number of 𝐺 = 2000 iterations and 𝑀 = 512 takes
about 80 minutes. Note that the computation for a single audio file
is limited by the single-core performance of the machine, and the
attack is fully parallelizable for multiple audio files.
4.3 Over-the-Air Attacks
We evaluate the attack for the lab setup as shown in Figure 7. The
approximate dimensions of this room are breal ≈ [8 m, 7 m, 2.8 m]
and the positions of the loudspeaker and the microphone are sreal =
[3.9 m, 3.4 m, 1.2 m] and rreal = [1.4 m, 1.8 m, 1.2 m], respectively.
We compute all adversarial examples with Algorithm 1. Based
on preliminary experiments, we set 𝐺 = 2000 and 𝑄 = 10. For
the distributions 𝐻𝜃 , we used two different versions, shown in
Table 1. 𝐻𝜃gen describes a generic room, while 𝐻𝜃adp is used as
an approximation to reassemble the real room from Figure 7. If
not specified otherwise, ℎtest, which is used for testing during the
attack, is drawn once at the beginning of the algorithm from the
same distribution 𝐻𝜃 .
The WER is measured for the recorded adversarial examples
after playing them via loudspeaker. The SNRseg is calculated after
applying a measured RIR ℎreal to both the original signal and the
adversarial example. We chose this approach since it corresponds

distributions are adapted to the lab setup in Figure 7.

to the actual signal perceived by human listeners if the adversarial
examples are played over the air.
For all cases, we calculated 20 adversarial examples. In some
cases, the audio samples clipped too much (exceeded the maximum
defined value of the audio, after the addition of the adversarial
distortion). As it would not be possible to replay those examples,
we removed them from the evaluation of the real over-the-air attack.
Each of the remaining adversarial examples were played five times,
and we reported the number of adversarial examples that could be
transcribed with 0 % WER.
4.3.1 Generic Over-the-Air Attack. First, we evaluate the attack
under the assumption that the attacker has no prior knowledge
about the attack setup. Specifically, we use 𝐻𝜃gen and calculate ad-
versarial examples for different reverberation times 𝑇60 and varying
length 𝑀 of RIRs. 𝑀 describes how many past sampling values are
considered, and the larger the reverberation time, the more impor-
tant are the past sampling values. We assume that, especially in
setups with high reverberation times 𝑇60, a larger 𝑀 will result
in more robust adversarial examples, as it is a better match to the
real-world conditions.
For the experiments, we used the variable-acoustics lab in Fig-
ure 7 to adjust the reverberation time and tested three versions of
the RIR length 𝑀 = 512, 𝑀 = 1024, and 𝑀 = 8192 for speech data.
The results in Table 2 confirm the above assumption: for 𝑀 = 8192,
we can obtain the best WERs, especially for the longer reverber-
ation times. Note that even if the WER seems to be high, for an
attacker, it is sufficient to play one successful adversarial example
with 0 % WER, which is also in line with the definition in Section 3.1
and, in fact possible. The SNRseg decreases with increasing values

for 𝑀, which indicates that more noise needs to be added to these
adversarial examples. However, the calculation time of the adver-
sarial examples increases by the factor of four from 𝑀 = 512 to
𝑀 = 8192.
4.3.2 Hearing Thresholds. To measure the impact of hearing thresh-
olds, we conducted the same experiments as for Table 2 with
𝑇60 = 0.42 and hearing thresholds. The results are shown in Table 3.
Compared to the version without hearing thresholds, the WER and
the total number of successful adversarial examples decrease. Nev-
ertheless, it was possible to find successful adversarial examples
for 𝑀 = 8192. At the same time, the SNRseg has improved values.
Additionally, the SNRseg measures any added noise, not only the
perceptible noise components. Therefore, the perceptible noise is
even lower than the SNRseg would suggest for the versions where
hearing thresholds are used.
4.3.3 Distance between Speaker and Microphone. In Figure 9, we
measured the effect of an increasing distance between the micro-
phone and loudspeaker. We used the shortest reverberation time
