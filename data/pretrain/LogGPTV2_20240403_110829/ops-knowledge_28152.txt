User: How to use Docker to build a containerized web application system? Please provide a specific step.
Assistant: The following are the steps to build a containerized web application system using Docker: 1. Write a Dockerfile: The Dockerfile is the blueprint file for Docker to build an image, in which you need to configure the environment, dependencies, and running commands of the project image. 2. Create a new Docker image: use the docker build command to build the image, execute the command docker build ./ -t mywebapp, where ./ indicates the path where the code is located, and the mywebapp after the -t parameter is the new image name, which can be Modify according to the actual situation. 3. Run the container: use the docker run command to run the container, execute the command docker run -p 8080:80 mywebapp to start the container, and map the local port 8080 to port 80 of the container. 4. Access the web application: Use a browser to access localhost:8080 to access the web application running in the container. The above are the specific steps to build a containerized web application system using Docker. It should be noted that every time the code is updated, the image needs to be rebuilt and the container re-run.
