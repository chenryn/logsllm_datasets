Your support is highly appreciated

Assistant: Windows Security Log Event ID 4657 will tell you when someone edits a registry key, so you can look for that in your Event Viewer.  The only caveat to this is that you have to turn on auditing first.  See this to turn on auditing for both domain and workgroup environments.

This is also a link from Microsoft supporting the method from techtarget.com.
