Subject: Monitoring Windows Server Registry Changes

Dear Support Team,

I am seeking a solution to track all changes made to the Windows Server registry. Specifically, I need a tool or audit policy that can provide detailed information on:

- Who made the change
- The old value of the registry key
- The new value of the registry key
- The type of change (e.g., delete, create, modify)

Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

**Solution:**

To monitor and track changes made to the Windows Server registry, you can utilize the **Windows Security Log Event ID 4657**. This event log will provide details about any modifications to the registry keys, including who made the change, the old and new values, and the type of change (delete, create, or modify).

### Steps to Enable Auditing for Registry Changes:

1. **Enable Auditing for Domain Environments:**
   - Open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**.
   - Navigate to the appropriate Group Policy Object (GPO) that applies to your servers.
   - Go to **Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Audit Policy**.
   - Enable **Audit object access** and set it to **Success and Failure**.
   - In the **Registry Editor**, navigate to the key you want to audit (e.g., `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM`).
   - Right-click the key, select **Permissions**, and then click the **Advanced** button.
   - Click the **Auditing** tab, and then click **Add**.
   - Select the user or group you want to audit, and then specify the permissions to audit (e.g., **Set Value**).
   - Apply the settings and close the Registry Editor.

2. **Enable Auditing for Workgroup Environments:**
   - Press **Win + R**, type `secpol.msc`, and press **Enter** to open the **Local Security Policy**.
   - Navigate to **Local Policies > Audit Policy**.
   - Enable **Audit object access** and set it to **Success and Failure**.
   - Follow the same steps as above to configure auditing for specific registry keys in the **Registry Editor**.
