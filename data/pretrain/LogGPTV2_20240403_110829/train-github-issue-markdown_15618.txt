### Affected Version
0.14.0-rc1
### Description
I created two dataSources for the same Kinesis stream, but it returned
different results for the same query. Duplicate raw events was found in one
dataSource (it was about 110 events). I'm suspecting this line. Maybe
`isExclusive` should be set to true. But, I'm not sure why it happened for
only one dataSource.
