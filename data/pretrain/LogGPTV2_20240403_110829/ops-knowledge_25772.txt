User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Which is the correct way to restart Solr I have made some changes at Solr Schema file and I see I 'am forced to restart SolR in order to have Solr running with new schema updates.

This is hosted on a server where solr is running from a start.jar file but I'am not sure how it was started(maybe with nohup)

I have found a way to stop SolR from another question(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2150767/how-to-start-solr-automatically):

kill `ps uax | grep -i "java -jar start.jar" | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}'`


After this, I start SolR with "java -jar start.jar".

Is this a correct way to do the restart or is there built-in/better way to restart the jar?

Assistant: At Websolr, we use a combination of a custom init.d script plus Monit to start Solr and ensure that it stays running.

That said, for a simpler self-hosted setup, I would recommend using Upstart to start and stop Solr, if your system has Upstart available. Upstart scripts have the benefit of being fairly simple, and Upstart does a good job restarting processes in the event they crash. Plus the start and stop commands (start and stop, respectively) are pretty easy to remember for the next time you need to make Solr aware of new configs.

Here is a good blog post covering starting Solr with Upstart. I've copied their upstart script below; be sure to update the relevant paths to match your system:

# Make sure the file system and network devices have started before
# we begin the daemon
start on (filesystem and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)

# Stop the event daemon on system shutdown
stop on shutdown

# Respawn the process on unexpected termination
respawn

# The meat and potatoes
