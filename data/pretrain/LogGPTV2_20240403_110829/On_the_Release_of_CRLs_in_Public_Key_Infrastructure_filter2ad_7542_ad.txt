CA by using different releasing strategies. If CA devi-
ates from the c0 = 17days by using 2 · c0 = 34days,
CA ends up spending almost $400, 000 more for just one
type of certiﬁcates within a period of β. This is not a
trivial number given that there are multiple CAs provid-
ing numerous certiﬁcate services.

5.2.2 Optimal Releasing Strategy When Time is
Smaller Than β
There are two possible business scenarios for this case:
1) A “grown-up” CA that has been in CRL business for
quite a while, but faces the situation of providing CRL
services for a new type of certiﬁcates. 2) A “start-up”
CA that just begin to provide CRL services. For these
two cases, v is inside (0, β], and F (v) is a convex func-
tion with respective to v. CA can take either a ﬁxed inter-
val or a ﬁxed size strategy for releasing CRLs. The ﬁxed
size means that a CA will release the CRLs whenever
the number of certiﬁcates included in the CRL exceeds a
ﬁxed pre-speciﬁed number. Next we analyze both cases
by using simulation. For each case, CA can get the pa-
rameter estimators either based on other types of certiﬁ-
cates it provides before or from its industry peers.
the analysis given for the case when time is greater
than β, we can obtain the cost function when the time is
smaller than β:

(26)
For each possible c, ranging from 1 to β, we com-
pute the total cost for CA. Figure 13 shows6 the total
cost for CA by using different releasing intervals. We
ﬁnd that when c = 28 days, we get the minimal cost
$2.08603 ∗ 105. This means that when time is smaller
than β, CA should release CRLs once every 28 days.
Recall that the optimal interval is 17 days when time
is greater than β.
It is easy to know that cost(17) =
$2.64014 ∗ 105 > cost(28) = $2.08603 ∗ 105 in the pe-
riod of (0, β]; therefore, CA should take different strate-
gies for time periods (0, β] and (β, +∞).
following variables for analyzing the ﬁxed size strat-
egy:

terval after β
• d: CA will publish a new CRL if the number of
certiﬁcate revocations exceeds d.
• q: Estimated numbers of CRLs that CA will publish
during one issued age from time 0 to β.

Then we have

(27)
In order to estimate N di, we need to compute the in-
verse function of F (v), which is denoted as G(d) (i.e.,
G(d) = F −1(v). After that, we can get the exact day
N di, on which CA needs to release its CRLs, by solving
N d1 = G(d), N d2 = G(2 ∗ d), . . . , N di = G(i ∗ d).
Given the LanbertW function deﬁned as
LambertW (x) ∗ exp(LambertW (x)) = x
(28)
we have
G(d) = LambertW · d(ek − 1)

(29)
We conduct our simulation step by step. Firstly, for
each possible d chosen from 100 to 36, 000 (a = 1000,
b% = 10%), compute N d1, N d2, . . . , N di. Secondly,
calculate the time difference between N di and N di − 1,
which we call ci, to estimate the liability cost. Thirdly,
compute cost(d) for each individual d as following
cost(d) =
Υ · a · b% · k · e−k

(ci − x)(1 − e−((i−1)ci+x+1)k)

(30)
We ﬁnd that the minimal cost is $2.26790 ∗ 105 when
d = 2800. The minimal cost is very similar to the result
that we obtained using the optimal ﬁxed interval. There-
fore, when time is smaller than β, CA can take either a
ﬁxed size strategy or a ﬁxed interval strategy. But CA
can no longer follow the same optimal releasing interval
as in the case when time is bigger than β.
Figure 14 shows the total cost for CA to use different
size strategies. The cost for CA is minimal when d =
2800.

Figure 15 shows the relationship between releasing
time and cumulative revocations when q = 100 and
k = 0.26 for the ﬁxed size strategy. Here we assume
that d = 2800. That means whenever the size of CRL
reaches 2800, CA will release it. That is the reason we
see 2800, 5600, 8400, and so on along x-axils. As we
can tell, as time moves away from time 0, the releas-
ing interval between two successive CRL releasing dates
remains almost unchanged. The ﬁxed size strategy is al-
most equivalent to the ﬁxed interval strategy at their re-
spectively optimal points.

To summarize, different types of CAs should take dif-
ferent CRL releasing strategies for the same type of cer-
tiﬁcate services, and the same CA should also use differ-
ent mechanisms for different types of certiﬁcate services.

6 Discussions and Conclusions
In this paper, we analyze real empirical data collected
from VeriSign to derive probability density function of
certiﬁcate revocations. Unlike most previous research,
our work is conducted based on real data. The contribu-
tions of this paper include: 1) We prove that a revoca-
tion system will become stable after a period of time;
2) CA should take different strategies when providing
certiﬁcate services for a new type of certiﬁcates versus
a re-serving type of certiﬁcates; 3) A start-up CA and
a grown-up CA should take different strategies for CRL
release; 4) We give the exact steps by which a CA can de-
rive optimal CRL releasing strategies; and 5) We prove
that a CA should release CRLs less frequently in the case
that the ﬁxed cost is higher, the variable cost is higher, the
liability cost is lower, or the issued age of certiﬁcates is
shorter.
There are several limitations for this study. First, this
paper takes a static approach by assuming that there
is no correlation between different types of certiﬁcates,
and that customer behaviors do not affect CA’s releas-
ing strategy for deriving the optimal CRL releasing inter-
vals. A more realistic approach is to use game theory to
model the interactions between CAs and customers. Sec-
ond, this paper assumes that CA offers certiﬁcates with
a ﬁxed issued age. To further minimize the total opera-
tional cost, CA may optimize not only the releasing time
interval but also the issued age simultaneously.
