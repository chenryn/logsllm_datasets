### Clear and Coherent Version

It is evident that \( q(2\theta + V_C) \) is greater than \( a \). The function \( 2\theta + V_C \) is an increasing function of \( F_C \) and \( V_C \), but a decreasing function of \( \Upsilon \) and \( \beta \), where \( \theta = F(\beta) = \frac{\alpha b\% k e^{-k}}{1 - e^{-k}} \left[ \beta - \frac{e^{-k}}{1 - e^{-k}} (1 - e^{-\beta k}) \right] \).

This implies that if the fixed cost (\( F_C \)) or variable cost (\( V_C \)) is higher, or the liability cost (\( \Upsilon \)) is lower, or the issued age of the certificates (\( \beta \)) is shorter, the Certificate Authority (CA) should release CRLs less frequently.

For example, to demonstrate the potential savings, the optimal waiting days to achieve minimal cost is \( c = q(2\theta + V_C) = 17.37 \leq a = 50 \) days. Figure 12 illustrates the total cost for the CA using different releasing strategies. If the CA deviates from \( c_0 = 17 \) days by using \( 2c_0 = 34 \) days, it ends up spending almost $400,000 more for just one type of certificate within a period of \( \beta \). This is a significant amount given that there are multiple CAs providing numerous certificate services.

#### Optimal Releasing Strategy When Time is Smaller Than \( \beta \)

There are two possible business scenarios:
1. A "grown-up" CA that has been in the CRL business for a while but faces the situation of providing CRL services for a new type of certificates.
2. A "start-up" CA that just begins to provide CRL services.

For both cases, \( v \) is within \( (0, \beta] \), and \( F(v) \) is a convex function with respect to \( v \). The CA can adopt either a fixed interval or a fixed size strategy for releasing CRLs. The fixed size strategy means the CA will release the CRLs whenever the number of certificates included in the CRL exceeds a fixed pre-specified number. We analyze both cases using simulation. For each case, the CA can get the parameter estimators based on other types of certificates it provides or from industry peers.

Using the analysis for the case when time is greater than \( \beta \), we obtain the cost function when the time is smaller than \( \beta \):

\[
\text{cost}(c) = \frac{\Upsilon ab\% k e^{-k}}{1 - e^{-k}} \sum_{x=0}^{c-1} \sum_{n=0}^{c-1} (c - n)(1 - e^{-(xc+n+1)k}) + F_C + \frac{\beta}{c} F(\beta) V_C
\]

For each possible \( c \) ranging from 1 to \( \beta \), we compute the total cost for the CA. Figure 13 shows the total cost for the CA using different releasing intervals. We find that when \( c = 28 \) days, the minimal cost is $208,603. This means that when the time is smaller than \( \beta \), the CA should release CRLs once every 28 days. Recall that the optimal interval is 17 days when the time is greater than \( \beta \).

It is clear that \(\text{cost}(17) = \$264,014 > \text{cost}(28) = \$208,603\) in the period \( (0, \beta] \); therefore, the CA should adopt different strategies for time periods \( (0, \beta] \) and \( (\beta, +\infty) \).

We define the following variables for analyzing the fixed size strategy:

- \( d \): The CA will publish a new CRL if the number of certificate revocations exceeds \( d \).
- \( q \): The estimated number of CRLs the CA will publish during one issued age from time 0 to \( \beta \).
- \( i \): The \( i \)-th CRL published by the CA, where \( 0 < i \leq q \).
- \( N_{di} \): The day on which the CA releases the CRL.
- \( F(v) \): The size of the CRL at time \( v \).

Then we have:

\[
F(v) = \frac{\alpha b\% k e^{-k}}{1 - e^{-k}} \left[ v - \frac{e^{-k}}{1 - e^{-k}} (1 - e^{-vk}) \right]
\]

To estimate \( N_{di} \), we need to compute the inverse function of \( F(v) \), denoted as \( G(d) \). After that, we can determine the exact day \( N_{di} \) on which the CA needs to release its CRLs by solving \( N_{d1} = G(d) \), \( N_{d2} = G(2d) \), ..., \( N_{di} = G(id) \).

Given the LambertW function defined as:

\[
\text{LambertW}(x) \cdot \exp(\text{LambertW}(x)) = x
\]

we have:

\[
G(d) = \text{LambertW} \left( \frac{d(e^k - 1)}{100ek} \right) + \frac{e^{-\left( \frac{d(e^k)^2 - 2dek + d + 100k}{100ek} \right)}}{100ek}
\]

We conduct our simulation step by step. First, for each possible \( d \) chosen from 100 to 36,000 (with \( a = 1000 \) and \( b\% = 10\% \)), we compute \( N_{d1}, N_{d2}, \ldots, N_{di} \). Second, we calculate the time difference between \( N_{di} \) and \( N_{di-1} \), called \( c_i \), to estimate the liability cost. Third, we compute the cost for each individual \( d \) as follows:

\[
\text{cost}(d) = \frac{\Upsilon ab\% k e^{-k}}{1 - e^{-k}} \sum_{i=1}^{q-1} \sum_{x=0}^{c_i-1} (c_i - x)(1 - e^{-(ic_i+x+1)k}) + q F_C + F(\beta) V_C
\]

We find that the minimal cost is $226,790 when \( d = 2800 \). The minimal cost is very similar to the result obtained using the optimal fixed interval. Therefore, when the time is smaller than \( \beta \), the CA can take either a fixed size strategy or a fixed interval strategy. However, the CA cannot follow the same optimal releasing interval as in the case when the time is larger than \( \beta \).

Figure 14 shows the total cost for the CA using different size strategies. The cost for the CA is minimal when \( d = 2800 \).

Figure 15 shows the relationship between the releasing time and cumulative revocations when \( q = 100 \) and \( k = 0.26 \) for the fixed size strategy. Here, we assume \( d = 2800 \). This means that whenever the size of the CRL reaches 2800, the CA will release it. As time moves away from time 0, the releasing interval between two successive CRL releasing dates remains almost unchanged. The fixed size strategy is almost equivalent to the fixed interval strategy at their respective optimal points.

### Summary

Different types of CAs should adopt different CRL releasing strategies for the same type of certificate services, and the same CA should use different mechanisms for different types of certificate services.
