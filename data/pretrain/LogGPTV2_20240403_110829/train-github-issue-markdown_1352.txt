Would it be possible to enhance the Stepper component so that it can have only
1 step?
Currently, `` needs to have an array of children of ``. I have
a use case where sometimes, only 1 step is needed.
So, i built a primitive workflow generator where the user can generate a
custom workflow. While quite primitive, it is visual, so users like it. More
importantly, this means no new budget needs to be spent on simple forms etc.
this means the business likes it even more. A new form of any kind means
budget someone has to pay for.
They basically want the exact same behaviour as the currently, but with only 1
step, because of this workflow generator. I have tried to explain to them this
is not the use case it is build for. But they like the interface.
Unfortunately i did not realise that people would use it like they are.
Clearly i'm the first tech person bitten in the arse by this. /sarc
Would be most appreciated.
