# Description of the new feature/enhancement
**Problem**  
The following pattern is inefficient from the command-line and often requires
an alternate GUI tool:
  1. Run a command that produces a list
  2. For each entry in the list, run another command
For example:
  1. git status (say we are interested in the conflict list)
  2. For each file in the list above, "vi filename" to resolve merge conflicts
  3. For each file in the list above, "git add"
In practice, this pattern has so much duplicate typing from the command-line,
often people are required to use a GUI tool instead.
**Proposal**  
Add a multi-command feature so the list work flow becomes:
  1. Run a command that produces the list (eg. git status)
  2. Alt-select list of interesting files
  3. Type "git add {special key}" to enter multi-command mode which replicates the current typed line for each row in the selection.
  4. Either type more commands afterwards or hit {enter} after to run multiple commands one at a time in the order they appear in the row selection.
