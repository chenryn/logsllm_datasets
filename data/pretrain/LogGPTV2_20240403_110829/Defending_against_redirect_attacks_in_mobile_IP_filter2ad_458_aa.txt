ABSTRACT 
The route optimization operation in Mobile IP Version 6 (MIPv6) 
allows direct routing from any correspondent node to any mobile 
node and thus eliminates the problem of “triangle routing” present 
in  the  base  Mobile  IP  Version  4  (MIPv4)  protocol.  Route 
optimization,  however,  requires  that  a  mobile  node  constantly 
inform its correspondent nodes about its new care-of addresses by 
sending  them  binding  update  messages.  Unauthenticated  or 
malicious binding updates open the door for intruders to perform 
redirect  attacks,  i.e.,  malicious  acts  which  redirect  traffic  from 
correspondent  nodes  to  locations  chosen  by  intruders.  How  to 
protect binding update messages to defend against redirect attacks 
is  a  challenging  problem  given  the  open  environment  in  which 
MIPv6  operates.  In  this  paper,  we  first  look  at  two  solutions 
proposed  by  the  IETF  Mobile  IP  Working  Group  and  point  out 
their  weaknesses.  We  then  present  a  new  protocol  for  securing 
binding  update  messages.  We  also  show  that  our  protocol 
achieves strong security and at the same time is highly scalable to 
wide spread deployment.

people’s  perceptions  of  the  Internet.  In  mobile  networking, 
communications activities are not disrupted when a user changes 
his/her  device’s  point  of  attachment  to  the  Internet  -  all  the 
network  reconnections  occur  automatically  and  transparently  to 
the user. 
In today’s Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) routes packets from 
source to destination according to the subnet prefix derived from 
the destination IP address by masking off some of the low-order 
bits. Thus, an IP address typically carries with it information that 
specifies  the  IP  node’s  point  of  attachment to the Internet. As a 
mobile  node  roams  in  the  Internet,  it  needs  to  change  its  IP 
address every time it moves to a new location. On the other hand, 
however,  to  maintain  existing  transport-layer  connections  as  a 
mobile node moves from one place to another, it must keep its IP 
address the same, changing the IP address will cause the existing 
transport layer connections to be disrupted and lost. 
The above dilemma is solved in Mobile IP (MIP) by allowing a 
mobile node to be addressed by two IP addresses, a home address 
and a care-of address. The former is an IP address assigned to the 
mobile  node  within  its  subnet  prefix  on  its  home  link  and  the 
latter  is  a  temporary  address  acquired  by  the mobile node while 
visiting a foreign link. The dual address mechanism in MIP allows 
packets to be routed to the mobile node regardless of its current 
point of attachment and the movement of the mobile node away 
from  its  home  link  is  transparent  to  transport  and  higher-layer 
protocols.  MIP  version  4  (MIPv4)  was  specified  in  [1]  and  the 
most  recent  specification  for  MIP  version  6  (MIPv6)  was 
published by the IETF Mobile IP Working Group in [2]. Mobility 
support in IPv6 is considered particularly important, since mobile 
devices  are  predicted  to  account  for  a  significant  fraction  of  the 
population of the Internet during the lifetime of IPv6. 
MIPv6  shares  many  features  with  MIPv4  but  there  are  several 
major  differences.  Among  them  is  the  support  for  “Route 
Optimization”  as  a  built-in  fundamental  part  of  the  MIPv6 
protocol, rather than an after-thought being added as an optional 
extension that may not be supported by all the nodes as in MIPv4. 
The  integration  of  route  optimization  functionality  allows  direct 
routing from any correspondent node to any mobile node, without 
needing  to  pass  through  the  mobile  node’s  home  link  and  be 
forwarded by its home agent, and thus eliminates the problem of 
“triangle routing” present in MIPv4. 
Route  optimization  in  MIPv6  requires  that  the  mobile  node,  its 
home  agent  and  the  correspondent  node  maintain  a  Binding 
Cache.  A  binding  is  the  association  of  a  mobile  node’s  home 
address  with  a  care-of  address  for  that  mobile  node,  along  with 
59 
the  remaining  lifetime  of  that  association.  A  mobile  node  uses 
binding  update  messages  to  notify  its  correspondent  node  or  its 
home agent of its current binding. Unfortunately, unauthenticated 
binding  update  messages  provide  intruders  an  easy  means  to 
launch  “Redirect  Attacks”,  i.e.,  malicious  acts  which  redirect 
traffic  from  correspondent  nodes  to  destinations  chosen  by 
intruders. Therefore, security of the binding update messages is of 
paramount  importance  for  MIPv6  to  meet  its  basic  security 
requirements. An earlier IETF draft on MIPv6 was returned by the 
Internet  Engineering  Steering  Group  (IESG)  to  the  Mobile  IP 
Working Group due to concerns about the security and scalability 
of binding update messages [3]. 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  we 
give a short overview of the operations in MIPv6, with emphasis 
on  route  optimization  and  binding  update  operations.  We  also 
detail  the  types  of  redirect  attacks  and  state  the  security 
assumptions  in  MIPv6.  In  Section  3,  we  review  two  solutions 
proposed  by  the  IETF  Mobile  IP  Working  Group  for  protecting 
binding  update  messages  against  redirect  attacks  and  point  out 
their security limitations. Section 4 is devoted to our new protocol 
and  its  analysis.  Finally,  Section  5  contains  our  concluding 
remarks.  
2.  OPERATION, REDIRECT ATTACKS 
AND SECURITY ASSUMPTIONS IN 
MOBILE IPV6 
2.1  Mobile IPv6 Basic Operation 
In  MIPv6  [2],  every  mobile  node  has  a  home  address,  an  IP 
address assigned to a mobile node within its home link. A mobile 
node  is  always  addressable  by  its  home  address,  whether  it  is 
currently attached to its home link or is away from home. While a 
mobile node is at home, packets addressed to its home address are 
routed  using  the  normal  IPv6  routing  mechanisms  in  the  same 
way as if the node were never mobile. Since the subnet prefix of a 
mobile node’s home address is the subnet prefix of its home link, 
packets addressed to it will be routed to its home link. 
While  a  mobile  node  is  away  from  home  and  attached  to  some 
foreign link (see Figure 1), it is also addressable by one or more 
care-of  addresses,  in  addition  to  its  home  address.  A  care-of 
address  is  an  IP  address  associated  with  a  mobile  node  while 
visiting a particular foreign link. The subnet prefix of the mobile 
node’s  care-of  address  is  the  subnet  prefix  on  the  foreign  link 
being  visited  by  the  node.  A  mobile  node  typically  acquires  its 
care-of  address  through  stateless  [4]  or  stateful  (e.  g.,  DHCPv6, 
[5])  address  autoconfiguration.  While  on  the  foreign  link,  the 
mobile node registers its care-of address with its home agent by 
sending a Binding Update message to the agent. The home agent 
thereafter  uses  proxy  Neighbor  Discovery  to  intercept  any  IPv6 
packets addressed to the mobile node’s home address on the home 
link,  and  tunnels  each  intercepted  packet  to  the  mobile  node’s 
care-of  address.  To  tunnel  intercepted  packets,  the  home  agent 
encapsulates the packets using IPv6 encapsulation, with the outer 
IPv6 header addressed to the mobile node’s care-of address. 
A  mobile  node  may  at  any  time  initiate  route  optimization 
operations with a correspondent node, allowing the correspondent 
node  communicate  directly  with  the  mobile  node,  avoiding 
delivering traffic via the mobile node’s home agent. The binding 
update  mechanism  is  also  used  by  correspondent  nodes  to 
dynamically  learn  and  cache  the  mobile  node’s  current  binding. 
When sending a packet to the mobile node, a correspondent node 
checks  its  cached  bindings  for  an  entry  for  the  packet’s 
destination  address.  If  a  cached  binding  for  this  destination 
address  is  found,  the  node  uses  an  IPv6  Routing  Header  [6]  to 
route the packet to the mobile node by way of the care-of address 
indicated in this binding. If, instead, the correspondent node has 
no cached binding for this destination address, the node sends the 
packet normally (i.e., to the mobile node’s home address with no 
routing  header),  and  the  packet  is  subsequently  intercepted  and 
tunneled to the mobile node by its home agent as described above.

2.2  Redirect Attacks 
In  the  present  paper  we  focus  on  redirect  attacks  and  their 
countermeasures in MIPv6. We will not consider security issues 
such as data confidentiality, data integrity and user authentication 
since they are beyond the scope of MIPv6 and can be provided, 
for  example,  by  IPsec  or  layers  above  IP.  We  classify  redirect 
attacks  in  MIPv6  into  two  categories,  Session  Hijacking  and 
Malicious Mobile Node Flooding, as depicted in Figure 2.

1.  Session  Hijacking:  In  the  session  hijacking  redirect  attack 
shown in Figure 2(a), we assume that a mobile node MN1 is 
communicating  with a correspondent node CN. An intruder 
sends  a  forged  binding  update  message  (or  replays  an  old 
binding  update  message)  to  CN,  claiming  that  MN1  has 
moved to a new care-of address belonging to a node MN2. If 
CN  accepts 
it  will  start 
communicating  with  MN2  instead  of  MN1.  This  is  an 
“outsider”  attack  since  the  intruder  tries  to  redirect  other 
nodes’  traffic.  Such  an  attack  may  result  in  information 
leakage, impersonation of the mobile node MN1 or flooding 
of MN2.

2.  Malicious  Mobile  Node  Flooding:  In  the  malicious  mobile 
node flooding attack depicted in Figure 2(b), an intruder, i.e., 
a  malicious  mobile  node,  sends  valid  binding  update 
messages to its correspondent nodes CN1 and CN2, claiming 
that it has moved to the Victim’s location. Here the Victim 
can be either a node or a network. For example, the intruder 
could initiate requests to video streaming servers, and flood 
the Victim’s node or network by redirecting traffic from the 
video servers to the Victim. This attack is an “insider” attack 
since the malicious mobile node is a legitimate mobile node 
in  its  home  link  and  its  actions  are  “legal”  binding  update 
operations. 
We  note  that,  instead  of  targeting  at  correspondent  nodes,  the 
above attacks apply equally to home agents of mobile nodes. By 
sending forged or malicious binding update messages to a mobile
