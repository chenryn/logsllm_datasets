or weeks). Even for so-called third-party accounts (whereby
a payment processor acts as middleman and “fronts” for the
merchant with both the bank and Visa/Mastercard) we have
been unable to locate providers willing to provide operating
accounts in less than ﬁve days, and such providers have
signiﬁcant account “holdbacks” that they reclaim when there
are problems.21 Thus, unlike the other resources in the spam
value chain, we believe payment infrastructure has far fewer
alternatives and far higher switching cost.
Indeed, our subsequent measurements bear this out. For
four months after our study we continued to place orders
through the major afﬁliate programs. Many continued to
use the same banks four months later (e.g., all replica and
herbal products sold through ZedCash, all pharmaceuticals
from Online Pharmacy and all software from Auth. Soft.
Resellers). Moreover, while many programs did change
(typically in January or February 2011), they still stayed
within same set of banks we identiﬁed earlier. For exam-
ple, transactions with EvaPharmacy, Greenline, and OEM
Soft Store have started clearing through B&N Bank in
Russia, while Royal Software, EuroSoft and Soft Sales,
have rotated through two different Latvian Banks and B
& S Card Service of Germany. Indeed, the only new bank
appearing in our follow-on purchases is Bank Standard
(a private commercial bank in Azerbaijan, BIN 412939);
RX–Promotion, GlavMed, and Mailien (a.k.a. Pharmacy
Express) all appear to have moved to this bank (from
Azerigazbank) on or around January 25th. Finally, one
order placed with DrugRevenue failed due to insufﬁcient
funds, and was promptly retried through two different banks
(but again, from the same set). This suggests that while
cooperating third-party payment processors may be able to
route transactions through merchant accounts at difference
21To get a sense of the kinds of institutions we examined, consider

companies already incorporated, immediately available.”
banks, the set of banks currently available for such activities
is quite modest.
D. Policy options
There are two potential approaches for intervening at
the payment
tier of the value chain. One is to directly
engage the merchant banks and pressure them to stop doing
business with such merchants (similar to Legitscript’s role
with registrars [25], [28]). However, this approach is likely
to be slow—very likely slower than the time to acquire
new banking facilities. Moreover, due to incongruities in
intellectual property protection, it is not even clear that the
sale of such goods is illegal in the countries in which such
banks are located. Indeed, a sentiment often expressed in
the spammer community, which resonates in many such
countries, is that the goods they advertise address a real
need in the West, and efforts to criminalize their actions are
motivated primarily by Western market protectionism.
However, since spam is ultimately supported by Western
money, it is perhaps more feasible to address this problem
in the West as well. To wit, if U.S. issuing banks (i.e.,
banks that provide credit cards to U.S. consumers) were to
refuse to settle certain transactions (e.g., card-not-present
transactions for a subset of Merchant Category Codes) with
the banks identiﬁed as supporting spam-advertised goods,
then the underlying enterprise would be dramatically de-
monetized. Furthermore, it appears plausible that such a
“ﬁnancial blacklist” could be updated very quickly (driven
by modest numbers of undercover buys, as in our study) and
far more rapidly than the turn-around time to acquire new
banking resources—a rare asymmetry favoring the anti-spam
community. Furthermore, for a subset of spam-advertised
goods (regulated pharmaceuticals, brand replica products,
and pirated software) there is a legal basis for enforcing such
a policy.22 While we suspect that the political challenges for
22Herbal products, being largely unregulated, are a more complex issue.
444
such an intervention would be signiﬁcant—and indeed merit
thoughtful consideration—we note that a quite similar action
has already occurred in restricting U.S. issuers from settling
certain kinds of online gambling transactions [11].
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have described a large-scale empirical
study to measure the spam value chain in an end-to-end
fashion. We have described a framework for conceptualizing
resource requirements for spam monetization and, using this
model, we have characterized the use of key infrastructure—
registrars, hosting and payment—for a wide array of spam-
advertised business interests. Finally, we have used this
data to provide a normative analysis of spam intervention
approaches and to offer evidence that the payment tier is
by far the most concentrated and valuable asset in the spam
ecosystem, and one for which there may be a truly effective
intervention through public policy action in Western coun-
tries.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This is, again, the most ambitious measurement effort our
team has attempted and even with 15 authors it would have
been impossible without help from many other individuals
and organizations. First and foremost, we are indebted to our
spam data providers: Jose Nazario, Chris Morrow, Barracuda
Networks, Abusix and a range of other partners who wish to
remain anonymous. Similarly, we received operational help,
wisdom and guidance from Joe Stewart, Kevin Fall, Steve
Wernikoff, Doug McKenney, Jeff Williams, Eliot Gillum,
Hersh Dangayach, Jef Pozkanzer, Gabe Lawrence, Neils
Provos, Kevin Fu and Ben Ransford among a long list of
others. On the technical side of the study, we thank Jon
Whiteaker for an early implementation of the DNS crawler
and Brian Kantor for supporting our ever expanding needs
for cycles, storage and bandwidth. On the purchasing side
of the study, we are deeply indebted to the strong support
of our card issuer and their staff. On the oversight side, we
are grateful to Erin Kenneally and Aaron Burstein for their
legal guidance and ethical oversight, to our Chief Counsel
at UCSD, Daniel Park, and UC’s Systemwide Research
Compliance Director, Patrick Schlesinger, for their open-
mindedness and creativity, and ﬁnally to Marianne Generales
and Art Ellis representing UCSD’s Ofﬁce of Research Af-
fairs for helping to connect all the dots.
