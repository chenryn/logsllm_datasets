User: I was trying to use the poll() function on Windows when I realized that only the select() function is supported on windows, and I believe poll() is supported on Linux.
Could anyone help me out as to what functions of the select module are supported on what operating systems?
Thanks
Assistant: From the python select documentation:

This module provides access to the select() and poll() functions
  available in most operating systems, epoll() available on Linux 2.5+
  and kqueue() available on most BSD. Note that on Windows, it only
  works for sockets; on other operating systems, it also works for other
  file types (in particular, on Unix, it works on pipes). It cannot be
  used on regular files to determine whether a file has grown since it
  was last read.
