I was attempting to use the `poll()` function on Windows when I discovered that only the `select()` function is supported on that operating system. I believe `poll()` is supported on Linux.

Could someone please clarify which functions in the `select` module are supported on different operating systems?

Thank you.

**Response:**

According to the Python `select` module documentation:

- The `select` module provides access to the `select()` and `poll()` functions, which are available in most operating systems.
- Additionally, it supports `epoll()` on Linux 2.5+ and `kqueue()` on most BSD-based systems.
- On Windows, the `select` module only works with sockets. On other operating systems, it also works with other file types (e.g., pipes on Unix).
- It is important to note that the `select` module cannot be used on regular files to determine whether a file has grown since it was last read.

This should help you understand the compatibility of the `select` module functions across different operating systems.
