 **Patrick Marschik** opened **SPR-9127** and commented
When you create an annotation based configuration class with a
`@PropertySource` annotation that provides multiple .properties files and a
name for that property source only one property source gets registered since
all `ResourcePropertySource` s have the same name and thus get overwritten by
the subsequent property sources.
Example:
    @Configuration
    @PropertySource(name = "someName", value = {"classpath:a.properties", "classpath:b.properties"})
    public class MyConfiguration {
    }
this will only register `b.properties` in the Environment since 2
`ResourcePropertySource`s with the name `someName` are created and added to
the environment.
