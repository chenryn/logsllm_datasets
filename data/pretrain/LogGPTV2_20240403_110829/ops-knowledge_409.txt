User:  Please explain what is RESTful API and how is it different from traditional API?
Assistant: RESTful API is a web API design pattern that can operate using different methods of the HTTP protocol such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and return responses using standard HTTP status codes. It follows a set of conventions and principles, including using URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) to identify resources, operating through HTTP methods, using standard HTTP status codes to return responses, using HATEOAS (Hypermedia Engine Application State), etc. In contrast, traditional APIs are usually based on the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol, using fixed operations (such as binding to method names) and parameter lists, etc. Legacy APIs may also not provide URIs to identify resources, nor may they use HTTP status codes to indicate responses. Traditional APIs usually need to be accessed using a dedicated client library, and the client needs to know the internal structure of the API in order to use it. A RESTful API, on the other hand, is more flexible, versatile, more readable, and supports interaction using web standards.
