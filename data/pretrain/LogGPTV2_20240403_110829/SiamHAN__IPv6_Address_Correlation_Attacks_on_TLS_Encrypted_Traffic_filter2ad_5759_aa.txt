**Abstract:**
Unlike IPv4 addresses, which are typically masked by a NAT, IPv6 addresses can be easily correlated with users' activities, posing a significant privacy risk. While mitigation strategies have been implemented to address this concern, existing methods for correlating addresses with users have become less reliable. This paper demonstrates that an adversary can still accurately correlate IPv6 addresses with users, even with these protective measures in place. We propose SIAMHAN, an IPv6 address correlation model that uses a Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network to determine if two IPv6 client addresses belong to the same user, even when the traffic is protected by TLS encryption. Using a large real-world dataset, we show that state-of-the-art techniques achieve only 85% and 60% accuracy for tracking target users and discovering unique users, respectively. In contrast, SIAMHAN achieves 99% and 88% accuracy.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the deployment of IPv6 by network providers [37, 41]. As a result, one-third of Internet users now access online services through IPv6 [17]. However, this growth has raised concerns about security and privacy issues, particularly the user activity correlation attack [9]. In such attacks, even on traffic encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS) [36], an adversary can identify and track users. Since IPv6 addresses usually correspond to individual users rather than groups due to the limited use of NAT, correlation attacks against IPv6 remain a serious threat to individual privacy. Activity correlation on IPv6 traffic can be categorized into address-based correlation and traffic characteristic correlation.

### 1.1 Address-Based Correlation
Address-based correlation allows an adversary to associate an IPv6 address with a user's activity, especially if the address is in a weak configuration. For example, a user might configure a constant interface identifier, making it easy to pinpoint their activity across multiple contexts [46]. To mitigate this, RFC 4291 [21] requires network operators to treat interface identifiers as semantically opaque, and RFC 4941 [33] extends stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) to allow IPv6 users to use temporary addresses.

### 1.2 Traffic Characteristic Correlation
Traffic characteristic correlation involves analyzing patterns in encrypted traffic to associate it with users' activities [2, 16, 27, 34]. While effective, these approaches often suffer from poor knowledge description and unreliable similarity learning, leading to false positives.

In this paper, we introduce a more sophisticated approach that overcomes these limitations, presenting a significant threat to the privacy of IPv6 users. Specifically, we develop a method to learn a correlation function from TLS-encrypted traffic, enabling an adversary to determine if two arbitrary addresses belong to the same user. Our proposed attack consists of two steps:
1. The adversary monitors TLS-encrypted traffic at a vantage point and constructs a knowledge graph for each client address.
2. Using Graph Neural Networks [52] and Siamese Networks [8], we introduce SIAMHAN, a Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network that employs multi-level attention and metric learning to capture the relationship between two IPv6 addresses with TLS-encrypted traffic.

## 2. Related Work
From an objective perspective, prior works relevant to ours focus on user activity correlation. From a technical perspective, the most relevant works involve heterogeneous graph representation learning and metric learning. We summarize and discuss these works below.

### 2.1 Address Structure Learning
One technique for correlating user activities with addresses is to learn address structure and infer user address configuration schemes. RFC 7707 [15] highlights known address configuration schemes and possible administrator customs. Measurement studies indicate that most addresses follow specific patterns, making them vulnerable to address structure learning. Works like [10, 12, 13] use unsupervised clustering or neural networks to facilitate active user discovery. However, RFC 4941 [33] proposes a temporary address configuration scheme with pseudo-random interface identifiers, making it difficult to identify users from the address structure. Ullrich et al. [47] analyzed the temporary address generation algorithm and showed that long-term observations could infer future temporary addresses, but this is impractical for large-scale user correlation. RFC 7721 [9] discusses the privacy and security considerations of IPv6 address generation mechanisms, indicating that certain constant information associations might prolong the observation time of temporary addresses. Our work combines address structure learning and traffic characteristics learning to achieve long-term user activity correlation.

### 2.2 Traffic Characteristics Learning
Another technique for correlating user activities with addresses is to extract multiple traffic characteristics and identify users. Prior work mainly learns traffic characteristics from three dimensions: user profiling [16, 27], TLS fingerprinting [2], and flow sequences [34].

#### User Profiling
User profiling involves using behavior-based statistical features to construct a user profile. Kumpost et al. [27] used target IP addresses to create user profiles for future traffic identification. Banse et al. [20] generated user profiles from DNS requests and used a Bayesian classifier [31] to track users on a university network. Gonzalez et al. [16] showed that leveraging Server Name Indication (SNI) information could effectively collect user online interests.

#### TLS Fingerprinting
TLS fingerprinting extracts parameters from a TLS ClientHello to provide visibility into the application creating the session. Applications include malware detection [3], operating system identification [2], and client identification [22]. Several open-source databases [1, 7, 30] have been released to support these efforts.

#### Flow Sequences
Flow sequences involve packet timings and sizes collected during user communications. Nasr et al. [34] used flow sequences to link egress and ingress segments of a Tor connection. Liu et al. [29] distinguished application types of user-generated traffic through these characteristics. These works demonstrate the effectiveness of flow sequences for user activity identification.

### 2.3 Heterogeneous Graph Embedding
Graph data is a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships between entities. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [18, 26, 49, 52] have been developed to analyze graphs. With the growing performance of GNNs, researchers are now focusing on heterogeneous graphs, also known as Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN) [38]. Wang et al. [52] proposed a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) for node classification and clustering tasks. We employ a heterogeneous graph to represent user behavior and use a multi-level attention mechanism to learn graph embeddings for correlation tasks.

### 2.4 Metric Learning
Metric learning, or distance metric learning, involves learning a distance metric for the input space of data from a given collection of similar or dissimilar entities. Representative works include KNN and SVM [54]. With the development of deep learning, Siamese Networks [8] have been proposed to model distance metrics using a pair of shared weight network architecture and a contrastive loss function. We implement a Siamese Network framework based on heterogeneous graph data, called SIAMHAN, to acquire a reliable correlation metric between IPv6 client addresses.

## 3. Preliminaries
This section outlines the threat model of IPv6 address correlation attacks and provides basic knowledge related to our attack model, including IPv6 addressing and TLS communications, to help readers understand the paper.

### 3.1 Threat Model
Figure 1 illustrates the threat model of IPv6 address correlation attacks. In an IPv6 network, N users may generate C client addresses to access online services within a period t. Typically, |N| ≤ |C| due to frequent changes in client addresses. However, the relationship between users and addresses cannot be detected using packet contents due to TLS encryption. The goal of an adversary is to correlate two arbitrary IPv6 addresses to identify a unique user. The adversary performs an IPv6 address correlation attack by using the encrypted communication behavior of all IPv6 addresses for a wiretapping time t as background knowledge κt. The adversary judges the relationship R of a pair of addresses (Ci, Cj) through a correlation function f:

\[ R = f((Ci, Cj) | \kappa_t) \]

The correlation function f can be learned by an attack model providing a distance metric for any pair of IPv6 addresses, which is used to determine if they belong to the same user through a threshold η.

### 3.2 IPv6 Addressing
An IPv6 address consists of a global routing prefix, a local subnet identifier, and an interface identifier (IID) [21]. While the global routing prefix is determined for routing traffic to a Local Area Network (LAN), the IID configuration ensures the uniqueness of the host interface in the local network segment. RFC 7721 [9] considers the security and privacy of various address configuration schemes, which present different degrees of privacy threats in the face of address-based correlation:

- **Constant IID:** An IPv6 interface identifier that remains globally stable, even if the node moves from one IPv6 link to another. It can be generated through an IEEE identifier [46] or static, manual configuration and can be used to correlate activities for the device's or address's lifetime.
- **Stable IID:** An IPv6 interface identifier that remains stable per IPv6 link, i.e., the IID will remain unchanged as long as the node stays on the same link.

## 4. Overall Design of SIAMHAN
SIAMHAN is designed to learn a correlation function from TLS-encrypted traffic, enabling the determination of whether two IPv6 addresses belong to the same user. The model uses a Siamese Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network to capture the relationship between two addresses. The design involves constructing a knowledge graph for each client address and employing multi-level attention and metric learning to learn the graph embeddings.

## 5. Experimental Setting
We evaluate SIAMHAN using a 5-month IPv6 user traffic dataset collected at a vantage observation point. The experiments aim to assess the model's performance in correlating the activities of pairwise IPv6 addresses and in long-term user tracking and user discovery tasks.

## 6. Evaluation Results
Our results show that SIAMHAN can correlate the activities of pairwise IPv6 addresses with 90% accuracy based on 1-month adversary's background knowledge. When applied to long-term user tracking and user discovery tasks, SIAMHAN outperforms existing correlation techniques. For instance, with a 5-month dataset, SIAMHAN achieves 99% and 88% accuracy in tracking target users and discovering unique users, respectively. This performance significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art correlation system Deepcorr [34], which achieves only 85% and 60% accuracy.

## 7. Mitigations Against the Attack
To mitigate the risks posed by SIAMHAN, we discuss several potential countermeasures, including enhancing address configuration schemes, implementing stricter privacy policies, and developing more robust encryption and anonymization techniques.

## 8. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced SIAMHAN, a new IPv6 address correlation attack that effectively correlates a user's TLS-encrypted traffic with their dynamic address. We presented a knowledge graph-based approach to model user behavior behind addresses, exploiting multi-type semantic meta-information to facilitate user correlation. Our extensive experiments on a 5-month IPv6 user TLS traffic dataset demonstrated that SIAMHAN is robust and can achieve drastically high accuracy on multiple long-term user correlation tasks. We also discussed potential mitigations to protect against such attacks.
