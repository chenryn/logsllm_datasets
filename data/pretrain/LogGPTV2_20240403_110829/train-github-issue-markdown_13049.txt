    In this program
    http://play.golang.org/p/NTlW5mD8qX
    the constant 1e-779137 underflows silently to 0 (while this is not well defined in the
    spec, it is not unexpected).
    But the constant 1e-779138 leads to a compile-time error:
    http://play.golang.org/p/LxjbNujhmO
    Both exponents are well past the range of values representable by float64.
    If floating-point constants silently underflow to 0 when materialized, they should
    always do that.
