Abstract  
This  paper  addresses 
safety  modeling  and 
evaluation  of  Automated  Highway  Systems,  based  on 
the  use  of  platoons  of  vehicles  driven  by  automated 
agents. We analyze the impact on safety of the strategy 
used  to  coordinate  the  vehicles  operations,  inside 
each  platoon  and  between  platoons,  when  vehicles 
enter  or  exit  the  highway,  or  when  maneuvers  are 
carried  out  to  recover  from  failures  affecting  the 
vehicles  or  their  communication.  To  cope  with  the 
complexity  of  the  studied  system,  a  compositional 
approach  based  on  stochastic  activity  networks  is 
developed. Replicated submodels associated with each 
vehicle,  describing  the  corresponding  failure  modes 
and  recovery  maneuvers  and  their  severity,  are 
composed  with 
the 
configuration  of  the  platoons  and  their  dynamic 
evolution. Numerical results are presented to highlight 
the  impact  of  the  coordination  strategy  and  other 
dependability related parameters.

Traffic 
increasingly 
growing 
especially in urban areas. One of the solutions for this 
problem is automated traffic. Many research programs 
have  been  carried  out  or  are  currently  underway  to 
implement Automated Highway Systems (AHS), based 
on  automatically  controlled  platoons  of  vehicles.  The 
investigated 
techniques  are  aimed  at  providing 
guidance  for  vehicles  to  improve  the  traffic  flow  and 
the  highway  safety  by  reducing  accidents,  while 
reducing  fuel  consumption  and  pollution.  In  this 
context,  several  studies  have  been  dedicated 
to 
collaborative  driving  systems,  based  on  coordinated 
vehicles  on  highways  equipped  with  the  necessary 
infrastructure (see e. g., [1-9]). They were particularly 
their  verification,  and 
devoted  to  the  design  of  control  architectures  for 
automatic  driving  and 
to 
performance evaluation in terms of capacity and traffic 
flow  [1].  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  the  safety 
modeling  and  quantitative  evaluation  of  such  systems 
have  been  seldom  addressed.  This  problem 
is 
challenging  in  the  domain  of  automated  highway 
systems implemented on ad-hoc networks. 
In  this  paper,  we  address  safety  of  AHS  based  on 
platooning  applications  implemented  in  a  mobile 
context with ad-hoc networks. A platoon is a series of 
coordinated  vehicles  that  are  moving  in  the  same 
direction on a highway [2]. The vehicles are driven by 
more  or  less  automated  agents,  interacting  in  a  multi-
agent environment [17]. Switching to manual driving is 
possible under specific circumstances.  
Our work aims at developing evaluation approaches 
and  models  that  make  it  possible  to  analyze  the  AHS 
safety taking into account several phenomena, such as 
accidental fault occurrences, success and failures of the 
recovery  maneuvers,  and  vehicles  coordination 
strategies.  The  developed  models  are  aimed  at 
providing  support  to  the  designers  for  the  analysis  of 
possible solutions of AHS, based on safety evaluation.  
We  consider  as  a  case  study  the  architectures 
developed 
the  PATH  project 
(Partners  for  Advanced  Transit  and  Highways  [10]) 
for  which  experimental  validation  tests  have  been 
performed.  These  architectures  implement  automatic 
recovery  maneuvers  to  ensure  the  platoons  safety  in 
the presence of different types of failures affecting the 
vehicles  and  their  environment.  We  have  developed 
models,  based  in  particular  on  Stochastic  Activity 
Networks  (SAN  [11,  12]),  to  evaluate  the  impact  of 
vehicle  failures  as  well  as  maneuvers  failure  and 
success, on the Automated Highway Systems safety.

together  with  its  failure  mode  analysis.  Section  3 
presents the proposed safety modeling approach and its 
associated  SAN  model.  Section  4  summarizes  the 
results  obtained  and  discusses  their  impact  on  the 
design  of  platooning  applications.  Finally,  Section  5 
concludes our findings and depicts future directions.  
We  briefly  present  background  information  on  the 
PATH  architecture  that  is  needed  to  understand  our 
safety  models.  We  mainly  focus  on  the  failure  modes 
considered and the recovery maneuvers used to ensure 
AHS safety, taking into account different strategies for 
intra-platoon and inter-platoon coordination.  
2. System description   
2.1. Failure modes and recovery maneuvers   
Each  platoon  is  composed  of  a  leader  that  is  the  first 
car of the platoon and a set of followers. A platoon that 
contains  one  vehicle  is  called  free  agent.  Figure  1 
shows  three  platoons:  p1  with  three  vehicles,  a  leader 
and two followers, p2 is a neighboring platoon, and p3 
is an example of free agent. The intra-platoon distance 
( x)  ranges  usually  between  one  to  three  meters.  The 
inter-platoon  distance  between  two  platoons  ( p)  in 
the same lane varies between thirty and sixty meters. 
Several  failure  modes, with various  severity levels, 
can  affect  the  vehicles  involved  in  platoons  and  their 
safety  [2,  13,  14].  Depending  on  the  failure  severity, 
various  maneuvers  can  be  considered  to  ensure  the 
safety.  Some  maneuvers  may  need  to  stop  the  faulty 
vehicle  or  help  it  to  exit  safely  from  the  highway  as 
soon  as  possible  with  the  assistance  of  adjacent 
vehicles2.  In  the  case  where  the  failures  have  a  minor 
effect on safety, the faulty vehicle could exit from the 
highway without the assistance of other vehicles.  
Figure 1: Context of a platooning application  
The  PATH 
research  program  has  defined 
hierarchical  control  architectures 
for  platooning 
applications.  The  platoons  use  lateral  and longitudinal 
positioning controllers (magnetic equipments) to allow 
the  vehicles  to  follow  each  other  safely.  The  vehicles 
are  coordinated  by  means  of  communications,  based 
among  other  things  on  information  from  the  magnetic 
equipments.  Several  maneuvers  have  been  defined  to 
allow the system to be in safe conditions in the absence 
and in the presence of failures (fail-safe mode).  
The  main  maneuvers  consist  in  splitting  a  platoon, 
merging platoons, or making a vehicle exit or enter the 
platoon.  In  case  of  a  failure  affecting  a  vehicle  in  the 
platoon,  the  maneuvers  allow  the  vehicle  to  leave  its 
platoon  without  any  hazard,  for  the  purpose  of 
continuously running the platoon without any problem. 
Before  starting  a  maneuver, 
the  faulty  vehicle 
communicates with its platoon s leader (that initializes 
the  coordination  of  the  maneuvers).  According  to  the 
failure  mode,  some  maneuvers  may 
require  a 
communication  between  the  leaders  of  neighboring 
platoons  in  addition  to  communications  with  adjacent 
vehicles  [13].  If  the  faulty  vehicle  is  the  leader, 
specific  maneuvers  must  be  applied  to  allow  the 
platoon vehicles to select a new leader. 
In the  following, we  first present the failure modes 
that might affect a single vehicle, their severity and the 
associated  maneuvers.  Then,  we  discuss  the  case  of 
failures affecting multiple vehicles. Finally, we present 
the  catastrophic  situations 
the 
automated  highway  system  to  an  unsafe  state.  The 
failures  of 
infrastructure  are  not 
considered in this paper.
