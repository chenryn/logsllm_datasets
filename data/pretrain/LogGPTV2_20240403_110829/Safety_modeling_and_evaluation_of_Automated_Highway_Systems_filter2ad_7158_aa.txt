## Abstract
This paper addresses the safety modeling and evaluation of Automated Highway Systems (AHS) based on platoons of vehicles driven by automated agents. We analyze the impact on safety of the strategies used to coordinate vehicle operations within and between platoons, particularly during entry, exit, and failure recovery maneuvers. To manage the complexity of the system, a compositional approach using Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs) is developed. Submodels representing each vehicle's failure modes and recovery maneuvers are integrated with the platoon configuration and dynamic evolution. Numerical results highlight the impact of coordination strategies and other dependability parameters.

## Introduction
Traffic congestion, especially in urban areas, is a growing concern. One proposed solution is the implementation of Automated Highway Systems (AHS), which use automatically controlled platoons of vehicles. These systems aim to improve traffic flow, enhance highway safety, and reduce fuel consumption and pollution. While many studies have focused on the design and performance evaluation of control architectures for AHS, safety modeling and quantitative evaluation have been less explored, particularly in the context of ad-hoc networks.

In this paper, we focus on the safety of AHS based on platooning applications in a mobile, ad-hoc network environment. Our work aims to develop evaluation approaches and models to analyze AHS safety, considering factors such as accidental faults, recovery maneuver success and failure, and vehicle coordination strategies. We use the PATH project (Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways) as a case study, where experimental validation tests have been conducted. The developed models, based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), evaluate the impact of vehicle failures and recovery maneuvers on AHS safety.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a system description and failure mode analysis. Section 3 presents the proposed safety modeling approach and its associated SAN model. Section 4 summarizes the results and discusses their implications for platooning application design. Finally, Section 5 concludes our findings and outlines future directions.

## System Description

### 2.1 Failure Modes and Recovery Maneuvers
Each platoon consists of a leader (the first car) and a set of followers. A platoon with a single vehicle is called a free agent. Figure 1 illustrates three platoons: p1 with three vehicles (one leader and two followers), p2 as a neighboring platoon, and p3 as an example of a free agent. The intra-platoon distance (x) typically ranges from one to three meters, while the inter-platoon distance (p) between two platoons in the same lane varies from thirty to sixty meters.

Several failure modes, with varying severity levels, can affect the vehicles in platoons [2, 13, 14]. Depending on the failure severity, different maneuvers are employed to ensure safety. For severe failures, the faulty vehicle may need to stop or exit the highway with the assistance of adjacent vehicles. In cases of minor failures, the faulty vehicle can exit the highway without assistance.

**Figure 1: Context of a Platoon Application**

The PATH research program has defined hierarchical control architectures for platooning applications. Platoons use lateral and longitudinal positioning controllers (magnetic equipment) to maintain safe following distances. Vehicles are coordinated through communication, including information from magnetic equipment. Various maneuvers are defined to ensure safe operation in the presence and absence of failures (fail-safe mode).

### 2.1.1 Single Vehicle Failures
Six potential failure modes have been identified, as shown in Table 1. This table lists each failure mode, an example cause, the severity class, and the associated maneuver.

| **Failure Mode** | **Example Cause** | **Severity Class** | **Associated Maneuver** |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| FM1: No brakes   | Brake failure     | A3                 | Aided Stop (AS)         |
| FM2: Inability to detect vehicles in adjacent lanes | Sensor failure | A2 | Crash Stop (CS) |
| FM3: Inter-vehicle communication failure | Communication link failure | A1 | Gentle Stop (GS) |
| FM4: Transmission failure | Mechanical failure | B2 | Take Immediate Exit - Escorted (TIE-E) |
| FM5: Reduced steering capability | Steering mechanism failure | B1 | Take Immediate Exit (TIE) |
| FM6: Single failure in a redundant sensor set | Sensor malfunction | C | Take Immediate Exit - Normal (TIE-N) |

The severity classes are ranked in descending order, with Class A being the most critical, requiring the vehicle to stop on the highway. Three maneuvers are defined for this purpose:
- **Gentle Stop (GS):** The faulty vehicle uses its brakes smoothly to stop.
- **Crash Stop (CS):** The vehicle stops abruptly.
- **Aided Stop (AS):** The vehicle stops with the assistance of adjacent vehicles.

For less severe failures, maneuvers such as "Take Immediate Exit - Escorted (TIE-E)," "Take Immediate Exit (TIE)," and "Take Immediate Exit - Normal (TIE-N)" are used to safely remove the faulty vehicle from the highway.

In the next sections, we will present the proposed safety modeling approach and discuss the results and their implications for the design of platooning applications.
