User:  Please list at least three common load balancing strategies and their advantages and disadvantages
Assistant: 1. Round-Robin load balancing: assign requests to servers in turn and use them cyclically. The advantages are simple and easy to implement, suitable for horizontal expansion, and effective use of server resources. The disadvantage is that the weight cannot be dynamically adjusted according to the actual situation, the overload problem of some servers cannot be avoided, and the server performance difference cannot be optimized. 2. Least Connections load balancing: distribute requests to the server with the fewest current connections. The advantage is that it can dynamically allocate requests according to the actual load of the server, effectively avoiding overload problems. The disadvantage is that it needs to record and maintain the current connection number of the server in real time, and the effect will not be good when the server performance varies greatly. 3. IP Hash (IP Hash) load balancing: through the hash calculation of the request source IP, the request is distributed to the corresponding server. The advantage is that it can ensure that requests from the same IP are allocated to the same server, which is suitable for scenarios that require special processing, such as maintaining sessions. The disadvantage is that there is a problem of hash conflicts, requests may be allocated to unsatisfactory servers, and it is difficult to expand service nodes.
