User: I'm writing a little script for Ubuntu. 
My intention is to call rhythmbox lyrics plug-in with a global short-cut (configuring gnome)  .
I can call it from rhythmbox python console, but I don't know how to import rhythmbox built-in modules (eg. rhythmdb).
Any ideas?
Assistant: in this case i guess you'll have to write the whole plugin yourself and , then listen to dbus for change of songs in rhythmbox , to detect which song is being played .
