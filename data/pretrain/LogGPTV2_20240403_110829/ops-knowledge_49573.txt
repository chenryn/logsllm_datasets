I am working on a small script for Ubuntu. My goal is to invoke the Rhythmbox lyrics plugin using a global shortcut, which I plan to configure through GNOME.

While I can call the plugin from the Rhythmbox Python console, I am unsure how to import Rhythmbox's built-in modules, such as `rhythmdb`.

Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve this?

To achieve your goal of invoking the Rhythmbox lyrics plugin with a global shortcut, you may need to take a slightly different approach since directly importing Rhythmbox's internal modules in an external script can be challenging.

One effective method is to create a custom plugin or script that listens for changes in the currently playing song via D-Bus. D-Bus is a message bus system that allows communication between applications, and Rhythmbox emits signals when the track changes.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. **Create a Custom Script:**
   - Write a Python script that connects to the D-Bus and listens for the `PlayingUriChanged` signal from Rhythmbox.
   - When the signal is received, you can then trigger the lyrics plugin or perform the desired action.

2. **Set Up the D-Bus Connection:**
   - Use the `dbus` library in Python to connect to the D-Bus and listen for the appropriate signals.
   - Example code to get you started:
     ```python
     import dbus

     def on_playing_uri_changed(uri):
         # Your logic to trigger the lyrics plugin
         print(f"Currently playing: {uri}")

     bus = dbus.SessionBus()
     rhythmbox = bus.get_object('org.gnome.Rhythmbox3', '/org/gnome/Rhythmbox3/Player')
     player = dbus.Interface(rhythmbox, 'org.gnome.Rhythmbox3.Player')
     player.connect_to_signal('PlayingUriChanged', on_playing_uri_changed)

     # Keep the script running
     import time
     while True:
         time.sleep(1)
     ```

3. **Configure the Global Shortcut:**
   - Use GNOME settings to create a global shortcut that runs your custom script.
   - You can use tools like `gnome-tweaks` or `dconf-editor` to set up the shortcut.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate the lyrics plugin with a global shortcut, providing a seamless user experience.
