## Abstract
The widespread use of mobile devices and cellular technology has generated significant interest in hybrid networks and their robustness and performance. Most smartphones and mobile devices are equipped with dual interfaces (WiFi and 3G/4G), making multi-path TCP (MPTCP) a promising approach to leverage path diversity for improved performance and reliable data transfers. This paper explores the performance of MPTCP in real-world scenarios, focusing on simple 2-path configurations. We address the following questions:
- How much can users benefit from using MPTCP over cellular and WiFi compared to using either interface alone?
- What is the impact of flow size on average latency?
- How does the rate/route control algorithm affect performance?

We are particularly interested in understanding how application-level performance is affected when path characteristics (e.g., round-trip times and loss rates) vary. To answer these questions, we conducted measurements using one commercial Internet service provider and three major cellular carriers in the US.

## 1. Introduction
Many users with mobile devices access the Internet through both WiFi and cellular networks. Typically, they use WiFi when available and switch to cellular otherwise. This switching results in variable quality of service, which can lead to highly variable download latencies, especially for data-intensive applications like web browsing and video streaming.

In this paper, we explore the use of multi-path rate/route control as a mechanism to provide robustness and reduce variability in download latencies. Multi-path rate/route control was first suggested by Kelly [17], and subsequent work by Key et al. [18] demonstrated its load-balancing benefits. Han et al. [10] and Kelly & Voice [16] developed theoretically grounded controllers, which have been adapted into Multipath TCP (MPTCP) [8], currently being standardized by the IETF.

Numerous studies have focused on the benefits of MPTCP for long-lived flows, leading to several changes in the controller [14,19,32] to improve fairness and throughput. However, the effect of MPTCP on finite-duration flows, such as typical web downloads and video streaming, has been largely unexplored. Most web downloads are less than 1 MB, while online video streaming to mobile devices typically involves a sequence of smaller data downloads (500 KB - 4 MB) [27].

In this paper, we evaluate MPTCP performance in a common wireless environment, using both WiFi and cellular simultaneously. We conduct a range of experiments varying over time, space, and download size, using three different cellular providers (two 4G LTEs, one 3G CMDA) and one WiFi provider. We report standard networking metrics (download time, RTT, loss) and MPTCP-specific metrics (e.g., traffic share, packet reordering delay). We also examine potential optimizations, such as simultaneous SYNs, different congestion controllers, and using larger numbers of paths.

## Contributions
- **Robust Performance**: MPTCP achieves performance at least close to the best single-path performance across various network environments. For large transfers, performance is better than the best single path, except in cases with poor cellular networks.
- **Download Size Impact**: Download size significantly affects MPTCP performance. For short transfers (less than 64 KB), performance is determined by the best path's RTT, typically WiFi. For larger transfers, MPTCP leverages both paths to achieve significantly improved download times, despite varying path characteristics.
- **RTT Variability**: Large and variable RTTs in cellular networks, especially in 3G, cause significant additional delays due to out-of-order segment reordering. This impacts MPTCP's ability to support multimedia applications like video.
- **Multiple Flows**: Using multiple flows improves performance across download sizes. For small transfers, more flows allow better exploitation of slow start. For large transfers, multiple flows utilize available bandwidth more efficiently. Different congestion controllers do not significantly impact small file transfers but show differences for larger files, with OLIA [19] outperforming the default coupled controller [24].

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Cellular Data and WiFi Networks
With the increasing use of smartphones and mobile devices, cellular operators have upgraded from 3G to 4G networks. 3G services provide a peak data rate of at least 200 Kbps, while 4G services offer 100 Mbps for high mobility and 1 Gbps for low mobility. In our measurement area, AT&T and Verizon have 4G LTE widely deployed, while Sprint only offers 3G EVDO.

Cellular networks provide broader coverage and more reliable connectivity under mobility, with extensive local retransmission mechanisms to mitigate TCP retransmissions. WiFi networks, on the other hand, have shorter RTTs but higher loss rates. Our observations show that 3G/4G loss rates are generally below 0.1%, while WiFi varies from 1% to 3%. The average RTT for WiFi is about 30 ms, while 4G RTTs are around 60 ms, increasing up to tenfold in some cases, and 20-fold in 3G networks.

### 2.2 MPTCP
#### 2.2.1 Connection and Subflow Establishment
MPTCP connections are established by initiating the first flow and notifying the server of additional IP addresses via an Add Address option. The client then sends a SYN packet with a JOIN option to associate the subflow with the MPTCP connection. For clients behind NATs, the server sends an Add Address option, and the client initiates a new subflow with a JOIN option and the exchanged hashed key.

#### 2.2.2 Congestion Controller
Each MPTCP subflow behaves like a legacy New Reno TCP flow, maintaining its own congestion window and retransmission scheme. We describe three congestion avoidance algorithms:

- **Uncoupled TCP Reno (reno)**: Uses TCP New Reno over each subflow, failing to provide congestion balancing.
- **Coupled**: The default MPTCP congestion controller, which couples increases and uses unmodified TCP behavior for losses.
- **OLIA**: An opportunistic link increase algorithm that provides better congestion balancing than the coupled algorithm.

## 3. Measurement Methodology
### 3.1 Experiment Setup
Our testbed consists of a wired server at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) and a mobile client. We focus on 2-path scenarios where the client has two interfaces activated, and the server has one interface. A second interface is used for performance comparisons between two and four flows.

The server is configured as a multi-homed host, connected to two subnets via Intel Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. The mobile client is a Lenovo X220 laptop with built-in 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi and three additional cellular broadband data interfaces. Both the server and client run Ubuntu Linux 12.10 with Kernel version 3.5.7 and the MPTCP Kernel implementation v0.86.

To reduce potential interference, we disable WiFi bandwidth sharing on AT&T and Sprint devices and use USB cables to extend cellular dongles. Cellular reception signals range from -60dBm to -102dBm, covering good and weak signals.

**Connection Parameters**: We configure the server to avoid caching parameters from previously closed TCP connections and set the default ssthresh value to 64KB to mitigate RTT inflation and ensure fair comparisons.

This setup allows us to conduct comprehensive measurements and analyze the performance of MPTCP in real-world conditions.
