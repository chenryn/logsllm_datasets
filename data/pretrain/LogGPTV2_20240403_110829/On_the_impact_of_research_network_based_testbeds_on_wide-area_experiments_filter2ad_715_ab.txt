ASes w ithin G R EN
Figure 5: Case 2: AS hops inside GREN. “W  10%: (1) The percentage RTT within GREN also
depends on the absolute value of RTT to the destination.
The closer the destination is to the source, the larger the
percentage RTT within GREN. This contributes to some
connections having a larger fraction of RTT within GREN.
(2) Some GREN nodes route to speciﬁc commercial nodes
through paths entirely in GREN. For example, GREN nodes
located in California route to planet3.berkeley.intel-research.
net, belonging to Intel Research, Berkeley, using the re-
gional California network (cenic.net) and the entire path
lies within GREN. Such connections contribute to the small
fraction of connections with 100% of RTT within GREN.
(3) Some routes traverse multiple GREN ASes before exit-
ing to commercial networks and hence have larger values of
fgRT T . For example, when planetlab1.ﬂux.utah.edu routes to
planet2.att.nodes.planet-lab.org, the route traverses 3 unique
GREN ASes before exiting to commercial network, result-
ing in fg = 37.5%. Figure 5 depicts the breakdown of how
many ASes a packet travels before it exits the GREN net-
work for fgRT T > 10%. Despite a major fraction of nodes
exiting GREN directly from their origin AS, some nodes
traverse other GREN ASes like regional networks before ex-
iting GREN. (4) We also observe that a few connections
travel long distances in a single GREN AS before exiting,
resulting in larger fgRT T .
Interestingly, very few paths (e.g., planetlab2.eecs.iu-brem
en.de → planetlab1.singapore.equinix.planet-lab.org) also ex-
hibit switching from GREN to commercial to GREN and
back to commercial networks. Finally, Figure 4(b) depicts
that up to about 100% of connections in N. America and
80% of connections in the World have an absolute RTT
of less than 10ms within GREN. Thus, the absolute RTT
within GREN is negligible for these connections.
Figures 4(c)(d) depict the number of router hops taken
until the route exits the GREN network. Figure 4(c) shows
that for up to 81.8% of connections in N. America and 74.7%
of connections in World, up to 40% of hops lie within GREN.
Once again, the closer the destination, the lower the num-
ber of total hops to it, and the higher the percentage of
hops within GREN. Also, the percentage of hops in GREN
is diﬀerent from that of RTT since each hop contributes
a diﬀerent RTT. For instance, typically, at the source and
the destination, a route travels several hops with an RTT
of approximately 1 ms. It is the hops in the middle of the
path that contribute the large fraction of RTT. The abso-
lute number of hops in Figure 4(d) indicates that up to 50%
of connections travel less than 7 hops before exiting GREN
network while the number of hops traveled in GREN ranges
uniformly from 1-10.
We conclude that for a signiﬁcant fraction of connections,
packets from a GREN to a commercial node stay within
GREN for a small fraction of the time. This suggests the use
of a predominantly “hot-potato” routing policy in GREN
networks when routing to nodes in commercial networks.

4.4 Case 3: Destination in GREN
We now examine the path of a commercial node reaching

a GREN node.
communicates with B, it needs to reach B by traversing a
fraction (fc) of its route in the commercial network. Alter-
natively, A may reach B using its commercial connectivity
directly, thereby causing fc = 1. The higher the value of fc,
the lesser the impact on the application performance. Note
that fc = 1 − fg. Hence, to understand the routing from A
to B, we again evaluate fgH , fgRT T , AH and ARTT.
We performed traceroutes from all nodes in C as sources
to all nodes in G as destinations for both North America and
World nodes. For North America, this resulted in 836 tracer-
outes out of which 163 traceroutes were unsuccessful while
for World this resulted in 3,879 traceroutes out of which 724
were unsuccessful. Figure 6(a) depicts the percentage RTT
within GREN (fgRT T ) while Figure 6(b) depicts the ARTT
within GREN. Figure 6(a) shows that for up to 70% of con-
nections in North America and 65% of connections in World,
less than 10% of the RTT lies within GREN. Among these
connections, 65% of them traverse a single GREN AS in
both North America and World (Figure 7). The remaining
connections traverse 2-3 ASes within GREN networks.
The following reasons explain why fgRT T > 10% for the
remaining connections : (1) Similar to in Case 2, connec-
tions with small end-to-end RTT contribute to larger fgRT T .
(2) Once again, certain commercial nodes use GREN ASes
to route to certain GREN destinations. For example, for
commercial node planet3.berkeley.intel-research.net, the en-
tire route to some other GREN nodes lies within GREN.
These connections have 100% of their RTT within GREN.
The destinations in this case include GREN nodes in Cal-
ifornia which are routed to through GREN (cenic). This
behavior is also observed in Case 2. However diﬀerent from
Case 2, apart from the California GREN nodes, this node
connected to nodes across the paciﬁc ocean (e.g., in Japan,
Australia and Taiwan) using GREN (pacif icwave non-proﬁt
network). This was also observed for other commercial nodes
in California such as planetlab-1.sjce.nodes.planet-lab.org. In-
terestingly, the backward route from the GREN nodes in
Japan, Australia and Taiwan to commercial nodes in Cali-
fornia actually traversed a commercial network. Thus pecu-
liar asymmetry can exist, i.e., the forward path uses GREN
and the backward path uses commercial networks. (3) Sim-
ilar to in Case 2, paths in Case 3 also traverse multiple
ASes within GREN (Figure 7). The number of paths tak-
ing greater than 1 AS hop in GREN are also similar (31%
in case 2 and 30% in Case 3).
(4) Finally, certain paths
traverse longer hops within GREN after they exit the com-

mercial network even if the number of GREN ASes traversed
are small. For example, when node planet2.att.nodes.planet-
lab.org communicates with planetlab1.iis.sinica.edu.tw, 190ms
of RTT is within GREN out of a total of 262ms.
Figure 6(b) depicts that close to 85% of connections in
N. America and 60% of connections in the World have an
absolute RTT of less than 10ms within GREN. These per-
centages are slightly lower than those in Case 2 suggesting
that routes from nodes in G exit faster from GREN when
going to a node in C while the routes from nodes in C enter
earlier into GREN when going to a node in G. This again
suggests asymmetry exists in the way GREN is utilized in
forward and backward paths.
Figures 6(c)(d) also depict the number of router hops
taken until the route enters the GREN network. Similar
to Case 2, Figure 6(c) shows that for up to 78.6% of connec-
tions in N. America and 68.5% of connections in World, up
to 40% of hops lie within GREN. Once again, the closer the
destination, the lower the number of total hops to it, and
the higher the percentage of hops within GREN. Also, the
percentage of hops is diﬀerent from the RTT since each hop
contributes a diﬀerent RTT. The absolute number of hops
in Figure 6(d) indicates that up to 80% of connections travel
less than 7 hops before entering the GREN network while
the number of hops in the GREN network range from 1-15
(slightly higher than in Case 2).
We, thus, conclude that packets from a commercial node
to a GREN node typically stay within GREN network for a
small fraction of time. This suggests the use of a predomi-
nantly “late-exit” routing policy (common for customer net-
works) when commercial networks communicate to a GREN
node in contrast to the “hot-potato” routing policy used
when a GREN node sends packets through its commer-
cial upstream provider networks. Further, the observations
made in Case 3 are largely similar to that in Case 2. An-
other interesting observation from both Case 2 and Case 3 is
that when a GREN node communicates with any commer-

cial node, the traﬃc from the GREN node exits the GREN
(i.e., the last hop within GREN) from one of a determin-
istic number of exit points. We refer to them as markers,
which are eﬀectively BGP peering locations. Thus, each
source GREN node can be associated with a set of markers
at which traﬃc enters commercial networks. Similarly, when
any commercial node communicates with a GREN node, the
traﬃc enters the GREN from one of a deterministic number
of entry markers. Also, entry and exit markers can poten-
tially overlap.
4.5 Case 4: Source and Destination
in Commercial Networks
In Case 4 (both A and B ∈ C), the situation is similar to
a testbed consisting of nodes only from the commercial In-
ternet and thus will not impact the application performance.
However, we wanted to study this case to make sure there
are no corner cases and that the traﬃc does indeed ﬂow over
commercial networks for all ﬂows. For Case 4, we performed
traceroutes from all nodes in C as sources to all nodes in C
as destinations for both North America and World nodes.
For North America, this resulted in 110 traceroutes out of
which 22 traceroutes were unsuccessful while for World this
resulted in 600 traceroutes out of which 100 were unsuccess-
ful.
The results depicted in Figure 8 conﬁrm that almost all
paths travel entirely outside GREN and in the commercial
Internet (RTT in GREN is close to 0ms for almost 100%
of connections). A rare exception is planet3.berkeley.intel-
research.net which uses GREN when routing to commercial
nodes in California such as sanfrancisco.planetlab.pch.net.
4.6 Summary
In summary, the measurements presented in this section
indicate that when applications using a mixed testbed re-
sult in communication between two GREN nodes2, the en-
tire traﬃc ﬂows over research and education networks, com-
pletely bypassing the commercial Internet. This can po-
tentially hamper the representativeness of network condi-
tions experienced by applications and potentially reduce the
usefulness of utilizing GREN nodes for experiments. How-
ever, on a positive note, measurements also indicate that in
Case 2 and Case 3; although the traﬃc in both cases tra-
verses GREN, the absolute RTT and the fraction of RTT
within GREN is negligible. Thus, when applications using
the mixed testbed result in communication between a GREN
node and a commercial node, the traﬃc predominantly ﬂows
over the commercial network. This fact potentially allows a
careful use of GREN nodes in experiments.
5.
IMPACT ON PERFORMANCE PROPER-
TIES OF NETWORK PATHS
The previous section has shown when the representative-
ness of application traﬃc ﬂows is aﬀected, in particular, the
ﬂows between GREN nodes bypass commercial networks.
Since the performance of any distributed application is di-
rectly dependent on the network performance properties of
paths over which its traﬃc ﬂow, we further study the im-
pact of the testbed on these performance properties to un-
derstand how it aﬀects the representativeness.
We proceed in two steps. First, we study how diﬀerent
the performance properties of the GREN ﬂows are com-
pared to ﬂows over commercial networks. Second, we study
whether the performance properties of GREN-commercial
and commercial-GREN paths also stay representative. Al-
though such paths appear to be representative as they travel
largely over commercial networks, the nature of the GREN-
commercial network peering can potentially be diﬀerent from
commercial-commercial peering enough to aﬀect the perfor-
mance properties of such paths even if they travel largely in
commercial networks.
5.1 Methodology
We study the following six performance properties of paths
in this section:
Round Trip Time (RTT) We measured the round trip
time between nodes representing Cases 1-4 using TCP ACK
/RST based probes to high numbered ports since they bet-
ter reﬂect the RTT experienced by TCP packets ﬂowing
through routers and are not ﬁltered like ICMP probes. Each
2The probability of communication between a pair of GREN
nodes is high due to the typically larger fraction of GREN
nodes in mixed testbeds (e.g., 85% in PlanetLab).
measurement uses 25 probes and was performed by each
node 3 times a day. We recorded the average, standard de-
viation and minimum RTTs (similarly as in [3]).
Path Loss We report loss rates measured by the tulip
tool [10]. The overall conclusions were also conﬁrmed through
the BADABING tool [22]. The data was averaged over 10 mea-
surement runs.
Throughput We measured the TCP throughput achieved
between nodes representing Cases 1-4 using Iperf [31]. Iperf
is a widely used tool used to measure achievable TCP through-
put and measurements between PlanetLab nodes are avail-
able [32]. We found the average and standard deviation of
throughputs for 90 traces collected over a 3 month period.
Available Bandwidth The average and standard de-
viation of the end-to-end available bandwidth is measured
using Spruce [24] since it was shown to be more accurate
than other tools designed for the same purpose in [24]. The
data consisting of 10 diﬀerent traces was collected from S3
[33, 28], that provides a sensing service for large-scale dis-
tributed systems such as PlanetLab.
Capacity The average and standard deviation of the bot-
tleneck capacity is measured using pathrate [6]. The data
consisting of 10 diﬀerent traces was collected from the S3
[33, 28] service. Note that the capacities observed do not
directly correspond to rate plans provided by ISPs due to
measurement noise. However, the trends observed in the
capacities measured are suﬃcient for our problem scope.
Bottleneck Location The bottleneck location is mea-
sured using the pathneck [8] tool. The measurements pre-
sented are based on a single run of the tool.
These properties are studied using a list of 22 nodes in
PlanetLab, 11 each belonging to G and C. We choose the
nodes in pairs (one each from G and C) such that each
pair has a similar geographic location. The nodes chosen
are both in the USA and outside USA. The locations of
the nodes and the organization they belong to are listed
in Table 1. The C2C (Case 4) connections are among the
11 commercial nodes while the G2G (Case 1) connections
are among the 11 GREN nodes. Thus, in total, there are
110 G2G paths and 110 C2C paths for which we compare
performance properties.
The nodes chosen do provide signiﬁcant diversity in their
outbound paths. For the 22 nodes used in the study, 15
unique commercial ISPs are used for Internet connectivity.
Some larger ISPs such as Level3, AT&T were used by mul-
