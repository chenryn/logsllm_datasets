The `--filter` option in the `deno test` command is designed to focus on a specific subset of tests, reducing noise and improving clarity. However, the current output includes a large number of "cancelled" test messages, which can be overwhelming and unnecessary. Here's an optimized version of the text, along with suggestions for improving the output:

### Purpose of the `--filter` Option

The `--filter` option in the `deno test` command allows you to run only a subset of tests that match a specified pattern. This helps in focusing on specific tests and reduces the noise from unrelated tests.

### Current Output

When running the following command:
```sh
deno test -A --filter "streaming api errors while streaming"
```

The output includes a long list of "cancelled" test messages, which can be distracting and difficult to read. For example:
```plaintext
Check file:///V:/dax/mod.test.ts
Check file:///V:/dax/src/commands/args.test.ts
...
Check file:///V:/dax/src/request.test.ts
running 1 test from ./mod.test.ts
streaming api errors while streaming ...
Uncaught error from ./mod.test.ts FAILED
should get stdout when piped ... cancelled (0ms)
...
timeout ... cancelled (0ms)
piping to stdin ... cancelled (0ms)
...
running 0 tests from ./src/request.test.ts
 ERRORS 
./mod.test.ts (uncaught error)
error: (in promise) Error: Exited with code: 1
        at CommandChild.pipedStdoutBuffer (file:///V:/dax/src/command.ts:545:17)
This error was not caught from a test and caused the test runner to fail on the referenced module.
It most likely originated from a dangling promise, event/timeout handler or top-level code.
 FAILURES
./mod.test.ts (uncaught error)
FAILED | 0 passed | 68 failed | 90 filtered out (816ms)
error: Test failed
```

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Remove "Cancelled" Messages**: Eliminate the "cancelled" test outputs to reduce clutter.
2. **Summarize Ignored Tests**: Provide a summary of how many tests were ignored in each file.
3. **Progress Messages for Files with No Matches**: Display a progress message that gets overwritten, and finalize with a count of files that were ignored.

#### Example of Improved Output

```plaintext
Checking test files...
- mod.test.ts: 1 test matched, 68 tests ignored
- src/commands/args.test.ts: 0 tests matched, 0 tests ignored
- src/commands/mkdir.test.ts: 0 tests matched, 0 tests ignored
- ...
- src/request.test.ts: 0 tests matched, 0 tests ignored

Running 1 test from ./mod.test.ts
streaming api errors while streaming ...

 ERRORS 
./mod.test.ts (uncaught error)
error: (in promise) Error: Exited with code: 1
        at CommandChild.pipedStdoutBuffer (file:///V:/dax/src/command.ts:545:17)
This error was not caught from a test and caused the test runner to fail on the referenced module.
It most likely originated from a dangling promise, event/timeout handler or top-level code.

 FAILURES
./mod.test.ts (uncaught error)
FAILED | 0 passed | 68 failed | 90 filtered out (816ms)
error: Test failed
```

### Summary

By removing the "cancelled" messages and summarizing the ignored tests, the output becomes more focused and easier to read. Additionally, providing progress messages for files with no matches helps in understanding the overall test execution flow.
