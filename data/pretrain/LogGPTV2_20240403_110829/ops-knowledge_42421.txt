User:  Please answer the following questions, what is the command commonly used in Linux to check processes with high I/O usage?
Assistant: 1. Use the iotop command to view the CPU and IO usage of system processes. Enter iotop -oP to view the process that is generating I/O. 2. Use the pidstat command to view the CPU and IO usage of the specified process. Enter the pidstat -d 1 -p PID command to display the IO usage of the specified process every second, where kB_rd/s and kB_wr/s represent the amount of data read and written by the process per second.
