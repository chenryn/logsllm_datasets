**Current behavior**  
Within a form which (by error) contains two inputs fields with the same "name"
attribute value (firstName is this case) Angular binds all the validations for
both fields
**Expected behavior**  
I expected to throw an error or apply the validation only for one field
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
  1. Go to: Plnkr Example Code
  2. The first field has only "required" attribute, so enter only ONE character
  3. See that "valid" property is still _false_
  4. Enter another two characters
  5. Now "valid" is true because the second fields has also "minlength" validation
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I think it's very confusing and there is almost no way to catch the problem in
a big form
