User: How to ensure the security of the company's internal network and prevent hacker attacks and data leakage? Please provide a network security plan.
Assistant: Ensuring the security of the company's internal network requires a comprehensive network security solution. The following is a network security solution that can be considered: 1. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) IDS and IPS can help companies detect and prevent hackers attack. IDS can detect abnormal network traffic and activity and send alerts to administrators. IPS can monitor network traffic and take immediate defensive measures when threats are found, such as blocking attack traffic and shutting down attack sources. 2. Network access control Network access control (NAC) can help companies restrict access to internal network devices, and only authorized devices can access internal network resources. This reduces unnecessary network traffic and reduces network risk. 3. Key encryption and authentication To protect sensitive data, data packets and files must be encrypted. Using encrypted data within the internal network prevents data breaches. Additionally, authentication can help confirm a user's identity and limit access. 4. Application and system patch management Application and system vulnerabilities may lead to hacker attacks. Timely patch management of applications and systems on the internal network reduces the risk of threats. 5. Data backup and emergency response plan Backup data can ensure the integrity and recovery of company data, so that it can be quickly restored after data loss or attack. Likewise, having an effective emergency response plan in place can limit damage in the event of a hack or data breach. In general, a network security program needs to fully consider the risks of the internal network and adopt many different defensive measures to protect data and systems. Before implementing the network security plan, it is necessary to do a good job of risk assessment and security threat simulation test, and to continuously monitor and update the network security plan to improve the security of the internal network.
