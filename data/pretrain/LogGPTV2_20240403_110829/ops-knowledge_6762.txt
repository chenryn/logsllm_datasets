User: How to implement dual-stack network access based on IPv4 and IPv6 in the Windows environment?
Assistant: In the Windows system, the dual-stack network access based on IPv4 and IPv6 can be realized through the following steps: 1. Open the control panel and select "Network and Sharing Center". 2. Select Change Adapter Settings, right-click the desired network connection, and select Properties. 3. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" and click the "Properties" button. 4. In the IPv4 property setting dialog box, select "Use the following IP address", and enter the IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server address. 5. In the IPv6 property setting dialog box, select "Use the following IPv6 address", and enter the IPv6 address, subnet prefix length, and default gateway address. 6. Click the "OK" button to save the settings and close all dialog boxes. 7. Now your system can support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. When browsing websites or connecting other network devices, the system will automatically select the required protocol version. Note that the above steps may vary depending on the Windows version and network environment. If you cannot successfully implement dual-stack network access, please refer to the official Windows documentation or contact the network administrator for assistance.
