Similar to the issue described in puppeteer/puppeteer#540, when navigating to a page that requires client certificates and such certificates are available, both Firefox and Chrome display a popup asking the user to select which certificate to use. It would be advantageous to implement an API that allows for the programmatic selection of the appropriate certificate (or to choose none). 

(Note: The last phrase "Digital marketing in Lahore" seems unrelated to the rest of the text, so I have omitted it. If you intended to include it, please provide more context.)
