2.3.3 Activities 
Team  Dynamics  activities  of  the  Initiating  Process  Phase  assist  the  OCM 
Practitioner and Project Manager in building a foundation for a positive and 
collaborative  work  environment.  The  activity  during  this  process  phase  is  to 
define the project team guidelines. 
Define the Project Team Guidelines 
As  organizations  and  projects  vary  in  size,  type,  and  complexity,  so  do  the 
expected behaviors of their project teams. A set of guidelines should define how 
team members interact with each other, communicate, and behave in the work 
environment. Working with the Project Manager within the scope of the OCM 
Schedule, the OCM Practitioner should assist with defining a set of guidelines 
that best fit the needs of the project team. These guidelines may include: 
•   Show respect to all project team members 
•   Support and promote teamwork within the team and with outside resources 
•   Consider the needs and impacts of your own work on others 
•   Celebrate each other’s success

•   Share knowledge and information 
The team’s guidelines will be unique to the specific team, team members, and 
working environment. Once the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager decide 
on the most suitable guidelines, the OCM Practitioner can utilize the Project 
Team  Guidelines  Template  to  record  and  display  the  behaviors  in  a  visible 
location for the project team to review and implement. This early foundational 
work will establish a positive and collaborative working environment for project 
team members throughout future process phases.

3.1   Complete the Checklist 
Once  all  of  the  OCM  activities  within  the  Initiating  Process  Phase  are  done, 
the process phase checklist should be completed. Why a checklist? Checklists 
are comprised of a list of questions built around why, how, what, who, where, 
and  when.  These  questions  can  help  verify  whether  everything  required  for 
val Lifecyclasks are
executing the project is in place. Many of these t
e repeatable from project 
to project and checklists help document these steps in order to ensure that the 
correct things are done at the right time, every time. 
A checklist can assist the OCM Practitioner with quickly and confidently identifying  
areas of concern within the Initiating Process Phase. In this case, completion of

The  Planning  Process  Phase  is  the  third  phase  in  the  California  Project  
Management Framework (CA-PMF) Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC). In this  
process phase, the OCM Practitioner conducts activities to address the people-
related  priorities  identified  in  the  Concept  and  Initiating  Process  Phases,  and  
strategizes and plans for the implementation of the full scale OCM efort in the  
Executing Process Phase. Five of the six OCM knowledge areas occur within this  
process phase: 
•   OCM Lifecycle Management 
•   Leadership Support 
•   Communication 
•   Team Dynamics 
•   Training 
Planning | Page 3 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanning1.1   Introduction 
In  the  Planning  Process  Phase,  the  project  team  defines  functional  and 
solution  requirements,  identifies  solution  alternatives  and  approaches,  and, 
as applicable, procures the necessary services and products. The next step of 
the Planning Process Phase includes the selection of the technology solution 
and the project team’s preparation for the Executing Process Phase. The OCM 
eforts focus on preparing leaders, Stakeholders which includes employees, as 
they become involved in the project. The OCM-related objectives of this process 
phase are to: 
•   Schedule OCM planning activities 
•   Initiate project communications 
•   Engage executive leaders 
•   Establish a strong team foundation 
•   Identify the training method and approach 
OCM Lifecycle Management 
OCM Lifecycle Management during this process phase focuses on conducting 
the  OCM  activities  identified  in  the  OCM  Schedule,  completed  during  the 
Initiating  Process  Phase.  These  activities,  which  may  be  supplemented  or 
modified throughout Planning, address the people-related needs pertinent to 
the project at this time. In addition, OCM Lifecycle Management activities plan 
and prepare for the OCM efort required in the Executing Process Phase. 
Communication 
In  this  process  phase  communication  is  important  to  engage  subject  matter 
experts and Stakeholders in the planning eforts. The OCM Practitioner assists 
the  Project  Manager  in  defining  the  necessary  communication  needs  in  the 
project  Communication  Management  Plan  while  the  project  team  executes 
relevant  high  level  communications  that  inform  leaders,  employees  and 
Stakeholders of the project status. 
Planning | Page 4 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanningLeadership Support 
Leadership Support activities allow the Project Sponsor to continue to become 
involved in project activities. The OCM Practitioner supports the Project Sponsor 
in  implementing  his  or  her  actions  as  they  relate  to  gaining  organizational 
support  for  the  project  to  move  forward.  In  addition,  the  OCM  Practitioner 
continues  to  involve  and  build  relationships  with  other  executive  leaders  to 
gain support for the change initiative. 
Team Dynamics 
The  project  team  ofen  grows  to  support  the  increase  of  planning  activities 
during this process phase. As the team expands, the OCM Practitioner supports 
the Project Manager in introducing and gaining project team support for team 
behavior guidelines. 
Training 
Training is a necessary component of IT implementations as end users need 
to gain new knowledge, skills, and abilities to work in the future state. An end 
user can be defined as any individual that will use the new system, whether 
internal or external to the organization. In order to plan and execute a beneficial 
training program, the OCM Practitioner begins to consider the necessary end 
user training eforts by identifying potential training methods and approaches. 
Once all OCM-related Planning Process Phase activities have been completed, 
the OCM Practitioner will complete the OCM Planning Process Phase Checklist. 
Figure 1-2 shows the goals, inputs, activities, and outputs of the five knowledge 
areas that are active during the Planning Process Phase.

Planning | Page 6 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanning1.2   Recommended Practices 
The following recommended practices will help the OCM Practitioner conduct 
OCM activities during the Planning Process Phase. 
Utilize Practices to Foster Two-Way Communication 
In planning and delivering communications, it is important to blend traditional 
forms  of  communication  with  approaches  to  persuade  employees  and 
Stakeholders of the urgent need to change. Organizations ofen rely on traditional 
forms of communication to inform, such as emails, newsletters, and memos, 
which seek to disseminate information across the organization in an eficient 
manner; however, to be persuasive, organizations need to involve Stakeholders 
in  an  interactive,  respectful,  honest,  and  consistent  communication  process 
that continues throughout the project. Two-way communication methods, such 
as surveys, one-on-one conversations, and facilitated sessions, can encourage 
honesty and candor. 
First Build a Communication Strategy, then Focus on Tactics 
An  efective  communication  strategy  encompasses  a  variety  of  tactics  aimed  
at  communicating  pertinent  messages  in  a  timely  manner  to  the  correct  
audiences. However, communication is too ofen reactive rather than strategic  
and  planned.  For  example,  launching  a  newsletter  is  a  communication  tactic,  
but  is  not  (by  itself)  a  coherent  strategy.  An  efective  communication  strategy  
includes  several  elements  essential  for  strategic  communications:  it  identifies  
audience information needs, pursues an audience-appropriate strategy for each  
Stakeholder  group,  and  provides  a  plan  for  communication  deployment.  For  
larger  eforts  the  strategy  may  benefit  from  rallying  key  change  Stakeholders  
throughout the organization. 
Align Executive Leaders to the Project Goals and Objectives 
As  organizations  undertake  transformational  technology  projects,  there  is 
a  critical  need  to  align  a  coalition  of  executives  to  the  vision,  purpose,  and 
goals of the proposed changes. The CA-OCM refers to this concept as executive 
alignment. It is a key ingredient to project success. Executives need to share 
and agree upon the vision and priorities, and, ultimately, support the proposed 
changes.  The  visible  actions  and  attitudes  of  executives  also  guide  how 
employees and Stakeholders perceive the project. 
Recommended 
Practices 
Review recommended 
practices at the start of  
the process phase. 
Planning | Page 7 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkPlanningEstablish Personal Accountability for the Project Team 
Individual team members should commit to project goals and schedules. Each 
team  member  should  work  to  complete  their  commitments  as  scheduled. 
Holding  everyone  accountable  for  completing  their  commitments  on  time 
helps to strengthen the project team and maintain a positive and collaborative 
work environment. It is important to develop these commitments and project 
foundation as each new team member joins the project team. 
Don’t Underestimate the Training Efort Needed 
End user training is a key step in ensuring a successful IT implementation. It is 
all too easy to misjudge and minimize the need for an end user training efort in 
order to save time and resources; however, a thoughtful, well planned training 
efort will provide ample opportunities for end users to obtain the knowledge, 
skills, and abilities needed to successfully use and adopt the new system. The 
OCM Practitioner should begin the training efort with a careful consideration of 
the methods and approaches to complete all projected training activities.

As  the  project  enters  the  Planning  Process  Phase,  the  goal  of  OCM  Lifecycle  
Management is to schedule planning activities, as shown in Figure 2-1. The OCM  
Practitioner continues to implement, assess, and adjust activities identified in the  
Initiating Process Phase to progress the OCM efort and facilitate organizational  
change. In addition, the OCM Practitioner begins detailing the Executing Process  
Phase activities by developing the OCM Plan. Figure 2-2 summarizes the inputs,
