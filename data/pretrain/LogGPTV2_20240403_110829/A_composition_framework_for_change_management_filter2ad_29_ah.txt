#### 2.3.3 Activities
Team Dynamics activities in the Initiating Process Phase help the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager build a foundation for a positive and collaborative work environment. The primary activity in this phase is to define the project team guidelines.

##### Define the Project Team Guidelines
As organizations and projects vary in size, type, and complexity, so do the expected behaviors of their project teams. A set of guidelines should define how team members interact with each other, communicate, and behave in the work environment. Working with the Project Manager within the scope of the OCM Schedule, the OCM Practitioner should assist with defining a set of guidelines that best fit the needs of the project team. These guidelines may include:

- Show respect to all project team members.
- Support and promote teamwork within the team and with outside resources.
- Consider the needs and impacts of your own work on others.
- Celebrate each other’s success.
- Demonstrate an ability to problem-solve.
- Seek and receive feedback for improvement.
- Share knowledge and information.

The team’s guidelines will be unique to the specific team, team members, and working environment. Once the OCM Practitioner and Project Manager decide on the most suitable guidelines, the OCM Practitioner can utilize the Project Team Guidelines Template to record and display the behaviors in a visible location for the project team to review and implement. This early foundational work will establish a positive and collaborative working environment for project team members throughout future process phases.

- Project Management
- Communication

### Process Phase Checklist
#### 3.1 Complete the Checklist
Once all of the OCM activities within the Initiating Process Phase are completed, the process phase checklist should be completed. Checklists are comprised of a list of questions built around why, how, what, who, where, and when. These questions can help verify whether everything required for executing the project is in place. Many of these tasks are repeatable from project to project, and checklists help document these steps to ensure that the correct things are done at the right time, every time.

A checklist can assist the OCM Practitioner with quickly and confidently identifying areas of concern within the Initiating Process Phase. In this case, completion of the checklist provides a clear milestone that the Initiating phase is complete, including:

- Completed OCM Schedule
- Completed Change Magnitude Assessment
- Completed Sponsorship Action Register
- Identified Key Executives
- Completed Leadership Support Assessment
- Completed Leadership Support Action Log
- Defined Project Team Guidelines
- Completed OCM Initiating Process Phase Checklist

A template is available: **OCM Initiating Process Phase Checklist**

### Organizational Change Management Framework
### Planning

In the Planning Process Phase, organizational change management (OCM) activities support the people-related aspects of the project and set the groundwork for the Executing Process Phase.

#### 1.1 Introduction
In the Planning Process Phase, the project team defines functional and solution requirements, identifies solution alternatives and approaches, and, as applicable, procures the necessary services and products. The next step of the Planning Process Phase includes the selection of the technology solution and the project team’s preparation for the Executing Process Phase. The OCM efforts focus on preparing leaders, stakeholders (including employees), as they become involved in the project. The OCM-related objectives of this process phase are to:

- Schedule OCM planning activities.
- Initiate project communications.
- Engage executive leaders.
- Establish a strong team foundation.
- Identify the training method and approach.

#### 1.2 Recommended Practices
The following recommended practices will help the OCM Practitioner conduct OCM activities during the Planning Process Phase:

- **Utilize Practices to Foster Two-Way Communication**: Blend traditional forms of communication with approaches to persuade employees and stakeholders of the urgent need to change. Two-way communication methods, such as surveys, one-on-one conversations, and facilitated sessions, can encourage honesty and candor.
- **First Build a Communication Strategy, then Focus on Tactics**: An effective communication strategy encompasses a variety of tactics aimed at communicating pertinent messages in a timely manner to the correct audiences. It identifies audience information needs, pursues an audience-appropriate strategy for each stakeholder group, and provides a plan for communication deployment.
- **Align Executive Leaders to the Project Goals and Objectives**: Align a coalition of executives to the vision, purpose, and goals of the proposed changes. The visible actions and attitudes of executives guide how employees and stakeholders perceive the project.
- **Establish Personal Accountability for the Project Team**: Individual team members should commit to project goals and schedules. Holding everyone accountable for completing their commitments on time helps to strengthen the project team and maintain a positive and collaborative work environment.
- **Don’t Underestimate the Training Effort Needed**: End-user training is a key step in ensuring a successful IT implementation. A thoughtful, well-planned training effort will provide ample opportunities for end users to obtain the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to successfully use and adopt the new system.

#### 2.1 OCM Lifecycle Management
As the project enters the Planning Process Phase, the goal of OCM Lifecycle Management is to schedule planning activities. The OCM Practitioner continues to implement, assess, and adjust activities identified in the Initiating Process Phase to progress the OCM effort and facilitate organizational change. Additionally, the OCM Practitioner begins detailing the Executing Process Phase activities by developing the OCM Plan.
