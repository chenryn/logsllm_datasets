**Current behavior**  
For example, in HostListener doc, there is no detailed descriptions for
`eventName`.  
In common that should be dom event names, but actually we could use it some
way like `document:click`/`keyup.esc` etc.
**Expected behavior**  
I think it should be a more clear doc for any details even that advanced
usage,  
e.g. how can we use that `eventName` in `HostListener` decorator.  
Angular is moving fast, any details should be checkable for developers.
Thx.
