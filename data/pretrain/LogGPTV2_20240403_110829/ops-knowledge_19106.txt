Strengthen system and application security: Regularly update security patches for operating systems and applications, enforce password policies and access controls, and reduce potential vulnerabilities and risks. 6. Centralized management and monitoring: Establish a network security management center (SOC), centrally manage and monitor network security incidents and threats, and respond to and solve various security problems in a timely manner. 7. Security training and awareness: Strengthen employee network security training and awareness education, improve employee awareness and prevention awareness of network security threats, and reduce security accidents caused by human factors.
