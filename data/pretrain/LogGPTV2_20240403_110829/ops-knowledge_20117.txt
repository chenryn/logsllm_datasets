User: I have a linux VPS that uses an older version of python (2.4.3). This version doesn't include the UUID module, but I need it for a project. My options are to upgrade to python2.6 or find a way to make uuid work with the older version. I am a complete linux newbie. I don't know how to upgrade python safely or how I could get the UUID modules working with the already installed version. What is a better option and how would I go about doing it?
Assistant: The best solution will be installing python2.6 in the choosen directory - It will you give you access to many great features and better memory handling (infamous python=2.4 memory leak problem).
I have got several pythons installed onto my two computers, I found that the best solution for are two directories:
$HOME/usr-32
$HOME/usr-64
respectively to using operating system (I share $HOME between 32 and 64 bit versions of Linux).
In each I have one directory for every application/program, for example:

ls ~/usr-64/python-2.6.2/
bin  include  lib  share

It leads completetely to avoiding conflicts between version and gives great portability (you can use usb pendrives etc).
Python 2.6.2 in previously example has been installed with option:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr-64/python-2.6.2
