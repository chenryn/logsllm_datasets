User: Please describe commonly used mainstream database types, including but not limited to relational databases, document databases, columnar storage databases, etc., and give application scenarios.
Assistant: 1. Relational database: Relational database is one of the most commonly used database types, based on the relationship between data tables and tables. In a relational database, data is stored in tables, which are made up of rows and columns. SQL is a language used to manage relational databases, capable of querying, updating, inserting, and other operations on data. Application scenarios include: all transaction data in the financial industry, user data in Internet companies, employee data in human resource management systems, etc. 2. Document database: A document database is a nosql database that stores data as documents (json, bson) rather than tables. Document databases are typically used to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data. Document databases support rich query languages (such as the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB). Unlike relational databases, document databases are suitable for storing complex data structures and can flexibly handle data with diverse structures. Application scenarios include: IoT device sensor data, user storage data of online books/e-commerce websites, and storage of textual content such as blogs and articles. 3. Column-based storage database: Column-based storage database is a database that uses columns as units and organizes data into columns rather than rows. It is mainly used in data warehouses or large-scale analysis modules, and is more suitable for data aggregation and analysis scenarios. Based on a columnar storage database, each column of data in the entire table is the same type of data, which is convenient for scaling large data volumes, high throughput, and can handle both structured and unstructured data equally. Application scenarios include: log-based big data analysis, data warehouse, e-commerce order analysis.
