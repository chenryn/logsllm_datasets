User: How to use the built-in monitoring tools of the Linux system to monitor system performance?
Assistant: The Linux system has multiple built-in monitoring tools. The following are some commonly used monitoring tools and how to use them: 1. top command: used to dynamically view system performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, processes, etc. Enter the top command in the terminal to run it. 2. vmstat command: Used to view performance indicators such as system memory, virtual memory, disk I/O, and CPU in real time. Enter the vmstat command in the terminal to run it. 3. iostat command: used to view the I/O situation of the disk. Enter the iostat command in the terminal to run it. 4. netstat command: used to view network connection status and statistical information, including TCP and UDP ports, network card information, etc. Enter the netstat command in the terminal to run it. 5. sar command: The function is similar to that of vmstat. You can view performance indicators such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network, and you can also analyze historical data. Enter the sar command in the terminal to run it. 6. ps command: used to view the processes in the current system and the resources they occupy, including CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc. Enter the ps command in the terminal to run it. In addition, third-party monitoring tools such as Graphite and Grafana can also be used to visualize the above monitoring indicators for more convenient monitoring and analysis.
