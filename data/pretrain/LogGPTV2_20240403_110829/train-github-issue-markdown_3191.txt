When the "Auto Hide Menu Bar" is enabled in the settings, some of the keyboard
combinations to bring it up do not work, because they seem to conflict with
other assignments eg Alt + f and Alt + h
To reproduce:
  1. Check "Auto Hide Menu Bar" in settings
  2. Have a file opened
  3. Clicking Alt + f will behave like Ctrl + Right arrow, instead of opening the "File" popup from the menu bar
