Sbotminer [31] detects search engine bots by looking for
anomalies in query distribution. Others, such as Sleuth [19]
and detectives [18] detect unusual collusion among users’
associated with diverse publishers (that may be indicative
of bot behavior). PremiumClicks [13], Bluﬀ ads [10] and
User-Driven Access Control [25] aim to authenticate user
presence (as opposed to automated bots) to mitigate click-
spam. Viceroi is a more general approach that proactively
targets all forms of click-spam including non-bot mecha-
nisms (like arbitrage, and search-hijacking) as well as so-
phisticated bots.
Spam and Click-spam. A lot of work has been done to
understand the spam ecosystem. [14, 17]. While both spam
and click-spam are Internet abuses used for proﬁteering, the
economics of spam and click-spam are diﬀerent. Click-spam
through search hijacking requires the spammer to pay 18¢
per install [3] (i.e., $180K for 1M installs in 2011), and nets a
fraction of the per-click revenue (typically less than $1) per-
user per-day. In contrast email spam costs almost nothing
to send to 1M users ($20 to rent [23]), and nets $30 per
victim [17] per-campaign. Spam needs a real product being
peddled and a market for the same, while click-spam does
not. The low-margin many-users nature of click-spam makes
the economics fundamentally diﬀerent from the high-margin
few-victims nature of traditional spam.
4. VICEROI DESIGN
We begin ﬁrst with the insight behind Viceroi, followed
by the detailed design.
4.1 Insight
As mentioned, our goal is to design a click-spam ﬁlter-
ing approach that does not rely on security through obscu-
rity, and cannot easily be circumvented by click-spammers.
Past approaches have looked for anomalies in ad impressions,
clicks, conversions, browser signatures, timing analysis, user
behavior, etc. Unfortunately, none of these are tamper-proof
— malware that has complete control of a computer can fake
any of these with ease.
Proﬁt. For click-spam to be economically viable, the click-
spammer must turn a proﬁt, i.e., the revenue he collects from
each click must (on average) cover his costs for generating
that click.
Generally speaking, there is a ﬁxed cost and an incremen-
tal cost (per-click) for the click-spammer. Click-spammers
renting botnets to generate clicks must pay the botmaster.
Click-spammers using cheap human labor to generate clicks
(in click-farms) must pay the workers. Click-spammers us-
ing arbitrage to generate clicks (described later) must pay for
cheap ads on a second ad network to acquire users. Click-
spammers laundering clicks from adult sites must pay the
adult website to acquire clicks [11]. When the click-spammer
has control over the user or user’s computer (e.g., click-farm
or botnet), the ﬁxed cost for getting that control is high
(typically, in the tens of cents [15, 22]) but there is little if
any incremental cost since the click-spammer can generate
as many clicks as needed. When the click-spammer buys
individual clicks (e.g., arbitrage, click laundering), there is a
per-click incremental-cost (typically, on the order of 1¢ [9])
and little if any ﬁxed costs.
Revenues are incremental, i.e., the click-spammer makes
money for each ad click (there is no ﬁxed component). The
click-spammer turns a proﬁt if his ﬁxed costs (amortized
over all clicks) plus his incremental costs per-click are (on
average) lower than his incremental per-click revenue.
Risk. For click-spam to be economically desirable, the
click-spammer must turn a higher proﬁt than an ethical pub-
lisher to oﬀset the risk of the click-spammer getting caught.
Since click-spammers can be legally penalized [5], if he were
not making higher proﬁts than an ethical publisher, then it
would be strictly safer for the click-spammer to make the
same proﬁt ethically and not run the risk of legal actions.
Potential for higher proﬁts gives an click-spammer the in-
centive for taking higher risk.
Insight: A click-spammer has higher ROI than
ethical publishers. In a sense, this higher ROI justiﬁes
the higher risk the click-spammer must carry, regardless of
the speciﬁc mechanism the click-spammer is using to commit
click-spam.
4.2 Intuition
As discussed above, there are only four variables that con-
trol the click-spammer’s proﬁts: (i) ﬁxed and (ii) incremen-
tal costs of generating the click, (iii) the number of clicks
the ﬁxed-cost is amortized over, and the (iv) incremental
revenue per-click. Of these the click-spammer cannot con-
trol his ﬁxed- or incremental- costs since they are set by
the underground market for purchasing bots, cheap labor,
and clicks. To command higher proﬁts than ethical pub-

Intuition behind Viceroi.
Idealized illustration (for
lishers the click-spammer has exactly two options. First, to
increase the number of clicks his ﬁxed-costs are amortized
over. And second, to increase his incremental revenue by
clicking on more lucrative ads. More clicks as well as clicks
on more expensive ads (per-user) results in more revenue
(per-user) as compared to ethical publishers.
In its simplest form, Viceroi could look for higher than
expected revenue per user for a given publisher. Putting
this into practice complicates matters slightly.
The ﬁrst complication arises from the diversity in rev-
enue per user for ethical publishers — there is no single
number that can serve as our baseline. Furthermore, the
vast diﬀerence between publisher sizes (ranging from indi-
vidual blog sites to multi-billion dollar companies) massively
skews the data. Surprisingly, we found from data collected
at a large ad network, that the revenue per user for a di-
verse set of manually-veriﬁed ethical publishers (including
a search engine, several blog sites, a content portal, an e-
commerce website, and a job listings site) all fall within a
narrow range on a log scale, while that for many well-known
click-spammers lies well outside this range. Viceroi thus uses
an expected log-revenue range per user (learned dynamically
from labeled data) as its baseline for ethical publishers.
The second complication arises from click-spammers using
a mix of ethical and unethical ways of generating clicks to
disguise their operation. For instance, a click-spammer may
acquire some organic traﬃc and supplement it with bot traf-
ﬁc, in eﬀect lowering his overall revenue per user. To account
for this, instead of using a single number, Viceroi compares
the distribution or revenue per user against a baseline distri-
bution. As illustrated in Figure 2, the expected log-revenue
range is expressed as a band around the baseline distribu-
tion. The ﬁgure is an idealized illustration (for clarity) based
on actual log data. In the ﬁgure, the solid green lines repre-
sent ethical publishers and the shaded region represents the
band around this baseline. The veriﬁed ethical publishers,
we found, agree not only on the log-revenue range, their dis-
tributions are fully contained within the band as well. While
many click-spammers fall outside the band either entirely or
in parts. An ad network can choose to either discount clicks
outside the band, or all clicks from a given publisher.
4.3 Detailed Design
Viceroi has two components:
i) an oﬄine part that an-
alyzes (past) click logs over multiple timescales to identify
click-spammers and regions in their revenue per user dis-
tribution that are anomalous, and ii) an online part that
identiﬁes whether a given click would fall in the anomalous
region (thus allowing that click to be discounted at billing
time).
Inputs. Viceroi requires ad click logs that contain the
publisher, user, and revenue for each click. In practice we
have found good results for as little as two weeks of past click
logs. Viceroi also requires a small diverse set of publishers
(around 10) to be identiﬁed as ethical publishers, which are
used to determine the baseline.
Algorithm. Viceroi performs the following steps in order.
1. For each publisher-user pair, Viceroi computes the log
of the sum of ad click revenues generated by the given
user on the publisher’s site.
2. For each publisher, Viceroi sorts the per-user log-revenue
sums and retains a vector of N quantile values. Recall
that quantile values are sampled at regular intervals
from the probability distribution function (PDF) of a
random variable. In our evaluation we found N = 100
to oﬀer good performance before diminishing returns
kicks in.
3. For the baseline, Viceroi computes the point-wise av-
erage of the quantile vectors for the given set of ethical
publishers.
4. Finally, for each publisher Viceroi computes the point-
wise diﬀerence between the publisher’s quantile vector
and the baseline quantile vector. The publishers click-
spam score is simply the L1 norm of the diﬀerence
vector (i.e., sum of the N point-wise diﬀerences).
Given a threshold τ (which characterizes the width of
the band around the baseline), if the click-spam score is
higher than N τ the publisher is ﬂagged, and all quan-
tile points where the point-wise diﬀerence exceeds τ is
recorded for use in the online component.
5. In the online component, whenever an ad is clicked,
Viceroi checks if the publisher is ﬂagged and the user
clicking the ad falls in the ﬂagged quantile region. If
so, the click is discounted.
Automatic Parameter Tuning (τ ). To automatically learn
the optimal value for τ , the ad network conﬁgures a tar-
get false-positive rate (e.g., 0.5%) and provides some la-
beled data that contain both positive and negative click-
spam cases. The labeled data may be a combination of
manual investigations conducted by the ad network, high-
conﬁdence output from existing ad network ﬁlters, other
sources of ground-truth e.g., Bluﬀ ads [10], etc. Viceroi then
performs a parameter sweep for diﬀerent values of τ and
picks the one that maximizes the number of clicks ﬂagged
given the hard constraint on false-positives.
5. DEPLOYMENT AND EVALUATION
We partnered with a major ad network to deploy and eval-
uate our approach. The ad network serves ads to many pub-
lishers that cater to both general and niche audiences. The
