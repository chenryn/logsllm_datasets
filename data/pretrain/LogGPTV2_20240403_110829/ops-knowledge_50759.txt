User: I wrote a python GUI in Tkinter for a time-clock system. The micro machine is wall mounted and the employees only have access to the touchscreen menu I programmed and a barcode swipe. I know how to get the script to start on startup, but how do I prevent them from exiting out or opening other menus? Basically the sole purpose of this console is to run the time-clock GUI.
If it cant be done in Ubuntu, is there another flavor of linux it can be done in?
Assistant: Don't start a window manager. Only start your program, e.g. from xinitrc. Make the program full-screen
