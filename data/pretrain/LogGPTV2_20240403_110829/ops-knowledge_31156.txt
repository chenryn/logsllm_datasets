User: Please explain the basic principles of virtualization technology and introduce different types of virtualization technology
Assistant: The basic principle of virtualization technology is to divide one or more physical servers into multiple virtual machines (VMs) through abstraction and isolation at the software or hardware level, and each virtual machine has its own operating system, runtime environment and applications , so as to maximize the use of hardware resources and improve server utilization and scalability. Different types of virtualization technologies include: 1. Full virtualization technology: Installing virtualization software on a physical server enables clients (virtual machines) to run various operating systems and applications, but requires additional CPU resources to simulate hardware , so the efficiency is low. 2. Partial virtualization technology: also known as paravirtualization technology, the client can share the resources of the physical server, but the kernel of the client operating system needs to be modified to access the virtualization layer, so only specific operating systems are supported. 3. Container virtualization technology: running containers on the host machine, each container shares the same operating system, but can run different applications independently, the container starts quickly and has high resource utilization, but it depends on the characteristics of the host operating system , does not support the coexistence of containers of different operating systems. 4. Network virtualization technology: allocate physical network resources to virtual networks on demand to achieve network services with high flexibility and good scalability. 5. Storage virtualization technology: Pool multiple physical disks into a logical storage pool to improve storage efficiency and availability.
