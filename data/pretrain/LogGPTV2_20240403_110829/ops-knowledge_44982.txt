In my `settings.py` file, I have configured the logging settings as follows:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=LOG_LEVEL, format=LOG_FORMAT)
handler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(
    LOG_FILE_PATH, 'a', LOG_FILE_SIZE, LOG_FILE_NUM
)
formatter = logging.Formatter(LOG_FORMAT)
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logging.getLogger().addHandler(handler)
```

I am using `mod_python` with Apache 2. The issue I'm encountering is that when the log files are rotated, multiple log files are created simultaneously. For example, if I set 5 worker processes in Apache, I end up with `log.1`, `log.2`, ..., `log.5` after rotation.

**Question:**
Do you have any suggestions for resolving this issue?

**Answer:**
The `RotatingFileHandler` is not designed to work effectively in a multi-process environment. Each process independently determines that the log file has reached its size limit and initiates a new log file, resulting in up to 5 new log files being created.

To address this, you have a few options:

1. **Use External Log Rotation Tools:**
   Utilize external log rotation tools provided by your operating system, such as `logrotate`. This tool can be configured to handle log rotation and can be integrated with Apache to ensure proper log management.

2. **Single-Process Logging Server:**
   Set up a single-process logging server that all worker processes send their logs to. This centralizes the log handling and avoids the issues associated with multiple processes managing the same log file.

3. **Inter-Process Locking:**
   Implement inter-process locking before creating a new log file and inform each process to reopen the log file. This approach is more complex and requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.

By using one of these methods, you can ensure that log rotation is handled correctly in a multi-process environment.
