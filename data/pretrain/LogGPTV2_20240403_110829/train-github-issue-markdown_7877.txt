The sort functions currently require a pure comparison function. Is this
actually required?
For example, I need to be able to sort the results of a query where the
results are not always orderable. If the comparison functions are allowed to
be impure then I can add a `err: @mut ~str` argument to my function and see if
it is set when the sort finishes. But if purity is required then I'll need to
do a pass before the sort which is a) duplicating a traversal that sort has to
do anyway and b) very inefficient (especially given that queries can have lots
of results).
