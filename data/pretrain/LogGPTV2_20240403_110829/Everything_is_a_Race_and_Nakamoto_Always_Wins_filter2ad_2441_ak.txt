blocks
of distinct depths from hi to b. Consequently, d ≥ (k −1) +(db −dh
i ).
Figure 8 displays the interplay between these parameters in the
context of an example attack.

longest chain under strategy πSZ . See Figure 9 for a visual example
of the πSZ attack. We next make the following observations using
the properties of πSZ : Via property (2) of πSZ , every adversary
is placed at a depth higher than dh∗
block mined after time τ h
.

i
Via property (1), every one of these adversary blocks mined after
is placed at a distinct depth. Hence, at time t, the deepest
time τ h
i
adversary block has depth at least dh∗
+A. Via property (3), the path
i
from this deepest adversary block to the genesis does not include b.
Consequently, at time t, the adversary following πSZ , has a private
chain that does not include b and is at depth at least dh∗
Finally, we observe via property (4) of πSZ that C∗ contains no
i
adversary blocks (except b when it is an adversary block). Then, at
time t > τb, C∗ contains b, and, it is exactly at depth L∗(t) = dh∗
+H
as ∆ = 0. Finally, to prove that the adversary succeeds under πSZ ,
we consider the following two cases:
• b is at least k-deep in C∗ at time t, i.e L∗(t) ≥ (k − 1) + d∗
.
b
However, since the adversary has a private chain that does
not include b and has depth at least dh∗
+H = L∗(t),
i
the attack is successful.
• b is not k-deep yet, i.e L∗(t)  0? Unfortunately, the answer is no: When ∆ > 0,
there does not exist a sample path worst attack. This is shown by
the following lemma:
Lemma F.1. Consider attacks for preventing the persistence, with
some parameter k, of some block hj , and, define the worst attack as
the strategy π∗ satsifying the following condition: If some strategy
π (cid:44) π∗ succeeds under a sequence of mining times, then π∗ also
succeeds under the same sequence except on a measure-zero set of
sequences. Then, when ∆ > 0, and, λa  0 such that P(S1) ≥ c for all j.
Second, consider the following set of mining times for the next
three blocks that arrive after hj:
• Let b, hj+1, and b′ denote these blocks in order of their min-
ing times.
• b is an adversary block and hj+1 is an honest block.
• Mining time of b satisfies the following equation:
i , τ h
• b′ is mined after time τ h
j + ∆.

chain that does not include any of the blocks hm, m = j, .., j + k − 1,
and, is at depth at least dh∗
Finally, we have seen above that at time t∗, the public longest
chain C∗(t∗) contains all of the blocks hm, m = j, .., j +k −1 and has
depth L∗(t∗) = dh∗
e∗ + H, whereas there exists a private adversary
chain that does not include the blocks hm, m = j, .., j + k − 1, and,
is at depth at least
e∗ + A ≥ dh∗
dh∗
e∗ + H = L
∗(t
∗).
Consequently, by broadcasting this private chain at time t∗, the
adversary can prevent liveness for the k consecutive honest blocks
hj to hj+k−1. This concludes the proof of part (ii) of the theorem.

F.2 Discussion on ∆ > 0
Theorem 5.1 shows that when ∆ = 0, there exists an attack strategy,
πSZ , such that if any attack π succeeds in preventing persistence
for a block b in the PoW model, this strategy also succeeds. Does
such an attack strategy exist when ∆ > 0 in the PoW model? Is
□
Finally, via the lemma F.1, we observe that, for any given attack
strategy π, there exists a set of mining time sequences with positive
probability (which can be very small) under which π is dominated
by some other attack strategy. However, it is important to note that
if we fix ∆ to be some finite value and π to be the private attack,
probability of such atypical sets of mining time sequences go to
zero as the parameter for persistence, k, goes to infinity. This is
because, as we have seen in the previous sections, the private attack
is the worst attack in terms of achieving the security threshold.
Figure 12: Blocktree for actions 1 and 2 under the sequences
1 and 2. Optimal actions for each sequence are marked with
a tick.
(Note that a worst attack will not mine b on a block preceding hj−1.)
See Figure 12 for the effects of these actions on the blocktree under
the sequences 1 and 2.
Now, assume that π∗ follows action 1. Then, under sequence 1,
the optimal behavior for π∗ is to broadcast hj+1 before hj becomes
public at time τ h
+ ∆, and, to prompt the honest miners to keep
j
mining on hj+1. Then, C′ becomes the public longest chain, and,
the adversary can balance the chains C and C′ in the future using
the private block b. However, if π∗ follows action 2, then, under
sequence 1, C would not be leading C′ via the private block, thus,
making it harder for the adversary to maintain a balance between
these two chains in the future. Hence, under sequence 1, for any
sequence of mining times for the blocks after hj +1, if π∗ following
action 2 prevents the persistence of block hj, so does π∗ following
action 1. On the other hand, there exists a set S3 of mining time
sequences for the blocks after hj+1 such that P(S3) > 0, and, under
the sequences in S3, following action 1 prevents the persistence of
block hj whereas following action 2 does not. Since P(S1) ≥ c > 0
for all j, the set S1xS2xS3 has positive probability. Consequently, the
worst attack π∗ does not follow action 2, implying that it follows
action 1.
Next, observe that under sequence 2, hj+1 comes to a higher
depth than hj. Hence, the optimal action for π∗ under sequence
2 is to follow action 2 as it enables the adversary to extend C′ by
one block using b. Action 1, on the other hand, does not help the
adversary in its endeavor to maintain two parallel chains from block
hj−1 as demonstrated by Figure 12. Then, under sequence 2, for any
sequence of mining times for the blocks after hj +1, if π∗ following
action 1 prevents the persistence of block hj, so does π∗ following
action 2. On the other hand, there exists a set S′
3 of mining time
sequences for the blocks after hj+1 such that P(S′
3) > 0, and, under
the sequences in S′
3, following action 2 prevents the persistence of
block hj whereas following action 1 does not. Since P(S1) ≥ c > 0
for all j, the set S1xS′
2xS′
3 has positive probability. Consequently, the
worst attack π∗ does not follow action 1, implying that it follows
action 2. However, this is a contradiction as the worst attack π∗
can choose only one of the actions 1 and 2. Hence, there does not
exist a worst attack π∗.
