### Title: US-19: Defense Against Rapidly Morphing DDoS Attacks

In June 2018, ProtonMail experienced a series of rapidly evolving and sustained DDoS attacks. These attacks included a variety of methods such as SYN floods, TCP handshake violations, TCP Zero Sequence, ACK floods, NTP non-standard port floods, and reflection attacks on SSDP, NTP, Chargen, LDAP, and Memcache protocols [1].

To better understand and defend against such attacks, we developed an attack toolkit that mimics the techniques used in the ProtonMail incidents. Using this toolkit, we conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of various defense strategies against rapidly changing DDoS attacks.

Our findings revealed that traditional manual approaches are insufficient for SOC (Security Operations Center) operators to counter these fast-evolving attacks. The speed at which humans can analyze and mitigate such attacks is simply too slow.

We discovered that the most effective defense strategy involves a combination of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm was used to establish a baseline, perform anomaly detection, and initiate mitigation. A second machine learning algorithm was then employed to fine-tune the performance of the first, enhancing its effectiveness.

With this integrated system in place, SOC operators no longer need to react at the same speed as the attacking machines. Instead, they can focus on monitoring the system's findings and actions, allowing for more efficient and effective response.
