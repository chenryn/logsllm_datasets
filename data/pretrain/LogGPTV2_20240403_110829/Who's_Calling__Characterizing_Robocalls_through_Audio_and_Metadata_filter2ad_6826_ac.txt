of time. We ﬁt a linear model to our weekly average call vol-
ume observed in our honeypot after discarding the two weeks
affected by server downtime, ﬁnding a slope of -0.0002, indi-
cating almost no change in the rate of unsolicited calls over
the study period. We also ﬁt a model after also discarding the
anomalous storm peak in April, ﬁnding an even smaller slope
of −9× 10−5. In addition to its signiﬁcance for the phone
network, this is also an important result for our evaluating
methods. While we do not know the history of the numbers
before we possessed them, on the whole we see approximately
the same volume of calls months after we take possession.
This implies that recent activity before we take ownership of
the line is unlikely to skew our results.
Finding 5: The call volume of unsolicited calls had a peri-
odicity of one calendar week. The call volume increased on
Mondays and remained high during weekdays. The call vol-
ume decreased on Saturday and remained low on Sunday. We
observed this pattern in every week of our data collection.
To measure the extent of periodicity, we compute the auto-
correlation score — a score from 0 to 1 which measures the
similarity of a signal with itself at different time lags between
the two copies of the signal. For daily unsolicited call volume,
we observed a maximum auto-correlation of 0.87 at a time
lag of 7 days.
Finding 6: Our honeypot received 83.36% of all unsolicited
phone calls during local working hours and 92.71% during

weekdays. Intuitively, we would expect to receive signiﬁcant
amount of unsolicited calls when users are available to answer
their phones. Weekends and non-working hours would seem
to maximize the user’s availability. Our honeypot received
83.36% of calls between 9 AM to 5 PM, as per the local
timezone of our honeypot (Eastern Standard Time), which is
roughly the local working hours. Furthermore, 92.71% of all
calls were received during weekdays.
4.2 Storms: High Call Volume Events
When we observed an abnormally high number of calls in
April of 2019, as seen in Figure 2, we delved deeper into
the distribution of these calls over our inbound lines. We dis-
covered instances when a disproportionately large number of
calls were received on speciﬁc inbound lines. Using average
call volume of each inbound line is not sufﬁcient to identify
such outliers. Inbound lines (e.g. abuse numbers) that regu-
larly receive a signiﬁcantly large number of unsolicited calls
would naturally have a higher average call volume, but does
not qualify as an outlier.
In this paper, we refer to such instances of high call volume
occurrence as storms. To systematically identify storms, we
wanted a uniform mechanism to compare call volumes in rel-
ative terms across all the inbound lines. To address this prob-
lem, we used z-score. The z-score is deﬁned as z = (x− µ)/σ,
where x is a data point in the distribution, µ is the mean and σ
is the standard distribution. We computed the z-score distribu-
tion of daily call volume per day, for each individual inbound
line. A z-score of 1 for a speciﬁc day indicates that the call
volume on that day is a single standard deviation away from
the mean call volume of the inbound line. A higher z-score
indicates that the measured value is farther away from the
mean. We use a conservative heuristic and set a z-score of
4 as the limit to identify calls that received abnormally high
calls per day during our study. A z-score greater than 4 indi-
cated that the call volume on the speciﬁc day was 4 standard
deviations higher than its mean call volume. Such behavior is
an intuitive indication of an outlier.
Even though z-score allowed us to develop relative com-
parison, it includes inbound lines which has very low average
call volume with sporadic calls. To remove these inbound
lines with low call volume, but with signiﬁcant high z-scores
due to an occasional call, we set a threshold of a minimum
call volume per day of 24 calls. A 24 calls per day threshold
translates to one call per hour — this is a signiﬁcant amount
of unsolicited call volume. We identiﬁed inbound lines which
received more than 24 calls on any single day, and had a z-
score of greater than 4 during our study. By so doing, we
identify inbound lines that received a signiﬁcantly high call
volume and characterize this phenomenon as a storm.
Finding 7: We observed 648 instances of storms spread
across 223 inbound lines. A 11 month long study helped
us uncover numerous instances of storms. The largest storm
comprised of over 1,400 unique unsolicited calls made to the
same number on the same day. These calls seemed to orig-
inate from over 750 unique callers based on the number of
unique caller IDs used. We note that in prior work, Gupta et
al. [6] report 2 “TDoS” events over their 7 week observation
period. Our ﬁndings indicate such events are rare, yet occur
regularly. We also note, our term “storm” does not imply ma-
licious intent, as we cannot attribute a course or source of
these events. Throughout our study, we observed storms as
early as March 2019 and as late as January 2020.
Our discovery of storms also conﬁrms anecdotal reports
where individuals seem to be deluged seemingly “out of the
blue” by dozens of calls in a day. Most of our storm events oc-

cur on unrecorded lines. 4 As a result, it is unclear if the storms
originate from a single operation or campaign, or if storms
comprise a chance coincidence where one line is randomly
targeted by many different campaigns.
4.3 Effects of Answering Unsolicited Phone
Calls
One of the most common recommendations to tackling the
problem of unsolicited calls is to not answer any calls orig-
inating from unknown numbers (numbers not in the user’s
contact list), under the hypothesis that answering will increase
call volume. To understand if there is a signiﬁcant impact of
answering phone calls to the number of unsolicited phone
calls received on an inbound line, we designed an experiment
and statistically evaluate our measurements. For this experi-
ment, we randomly selected 3000 inbound lines, which were
the same lines initially referred to as Recording List 1 (RL1).
Initially, we did not answer any unsolicited calls made to these
3000 inbound lines for 6 weeks. Next, we answered all calls
received on these 3000 inbound lines and observed the call
volume for 6 weeks. We calculated the average call volume of
each line in RL1 during the ﬁrst 6 weeks of not answering the
phone call. We also computed the average call volume during
the next 6 weeks, when we answered all calls made to these
inbound lines. To understand if there is signiﬁcant evidence
that answering phone calls has an effect on the number of
unsolicited phone calls, we apply a statistical test based on
average call volume observed from 17th February to 12th
April of 2019.
We use t-test for dependent populations to measure if the
difference between the means of two populations is signiﬁ-
cant. We also select an alpha value of 0.01 to determine the
signiﬁcance of our statistical test. Our p-value should be less
than alpha to indicate statistical signiﬁcance.
Since we observe a peak in overall call volume, which we
have associated to storms, we checked if any of the inbound
lines of RL1 were victims of such huge call volume. We
conﬁrmed that there were no storms associated with any of
the RL1 inbound lines. This steps ensures that there were no
outliers when we perform the t-test.
Finding 8: Answering unsolicited calls did not have a statis-
tically signiﬁcant effect on the average number of unsolicited
phone calls received on a phone number. We observed that
average call volume when not answering calls was 0.1027
and average call volume when we were answering phone calls
was 0.0944. Our t-test indicated the result was statistically
insigniﬁcant (p = 0.0708). Through this result, we conclude
that there is no evidence that answering phone call increases
the number of unsolicited phone calls received. This ﬁnding
contradicts the traditional wisdom and provides insight to
operators in that our ﬁndings indicate that it would be safe for

to the fact the majority of our lines are not answered.
operators to monitor and use lines without the risk of further
contamination.
4.4 Voicemail Spam
Unlike traditional landline or mobile phones, our inbound
lines did not have the restriction of maintaining only one ac-
tive call at a time. Such a conﬁguration allowed us to observe
multiple call attempts with the same calling and called num-
bers in quick succession — a classic behavior of voicemail
spam. Since the successive call attempts maintained the same
calling and called numbers, we identiﬁed groups which have
a unique 3 tuple of the calling number, the called number
and the date. We discard the groups which have a single call.
Next, we calculate the time difference between successive
calls in each group. Since our honeypot rejected a fraction of
incoming calls with a 403 SIP Response code, we observed
clients re-trying the same call within a short duration of time,
as discussed in section 3. After referring to the SIP retrans-
mission section in the SIP [18] RFC, we remove all duplicate
retries within 30 seconds of each other.
Finding 9: We estimate that 2.91% of all calls made to our
honeypot were suspected voicemail injection attacks. Most
adversaries need to tune their campaigns through manual
delay measurement and determine the ideal time difference
between successive calls for executing voicemail spam. Such
delay estimation vary depending on how a phone call is routed
from the source to the destination. We performed test calls
across multiple originating service providers to estimate the
delay associated with call setup. By empirical estimation, we
set a conservative window of 30 to 90 seconds as the time
difference between successive calls to execute a successful
voicemail injection. We identiﬁed 43,170 calls within this
window which we believe are successful voicemail spam or
voicemail injection attempts.
Our ﬁndings also indicate that voicemail spam is likely
a signiﬁcant problem. However, because our heuristics rely
only on signaling information alone, it should be detectable
by carriers. Though in magnitude similar, this would have the
effect of eliminating an entire class of telephone fraud. While
we have tried to design our heuristics to make it practical and
usable, careful testing and validation with ground truth is
essential before deployment in live networks.
4.5 Caller ID Spooﬁng
Finding 10: We estimate that 6.12% of all unsolicited calls
used neighbor spooﬁng techniques. For calls where the call-
ing number adheres to NANP, we compare the calling number
with the called number to identify the length of the match. We
compared the calling and the called numbers and found that
27.67 % (409,876) of all calls had identical area codes (NPA)
between the calling and the called number. Further, 6.12%
(90,648) calls had both, a matching area code and a matching
404    29th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
exchange code (NPA+NXX). Surprisingly, 0.05% (698) calls
were made with the same calling number as the called number
for that call. We also observed that for 0.07% (976) calls, the
caller ID used by the calling side was one of the 66,606 phone
numbers owned by us. We used libphonenumber 5 module
and openly available information from North American Num-
bering Plan Administrator’s 6 website to parse and validate
the non-US and US phone numbers respectively. We highlight
neighbor spooﬁng as one example of a particular robocalling
strategy. As callers continue to evolve their tactics we can use
similar techniques to identify other trends and patterns.
Regulatory changes made by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) in November 2017 [19] authorized tele-
com operators to block calls which seem to originate from
unassigned, unallocated or invalid phone numbers. It also al-
lowed providers to maintain a Do Not Originate list and block
calls which seem to originate from a number on this list. These
changes did not address scenarios where legitimate numbers
were used to spoof the caller ID or when caller ID was not
spoofed at all. The FCC acknowledged these limitations and
allowed more ﬂexibility to block calls by empowering the
providers through its more recent regulatory changes in June
2019 [20].
Finding 11: We found that only 3.2% (47,910 calls) of all
the unsolicited calls made to our honeypot could have been
outright blocked by providers. We observed that only 5.97%
(8,633) of all unique calling numbers seen in our honeypot
met the criteria of call blocking. These percentages are a lower
bound on the effectiveness of provider based call blocking,
mainly because we cannot measure or collect information
about calls which were blocked by the upstream providers.
As described in Section 3.3, calling parties can mask their
identity by dialing with speciﬁc preﬁxes, like *67. In our
honeypot, we collected SIP logs from which we extracted the
caller ID information of unsolicited calls attempting to dial
with a preﬁx, and in-turn mask their original caller ID.
Finding 12: Out of 72,197 unsolicited calls which attempted
to mask their caller ID by dialing with *67 as a preﬁx, 79.16%
(57,151) were successful. A small fraction (20.85%) of these
unsolicited callers leaked their actual caller ID through the
“P-Asserted Identity” SIP header, but most calls that dialed a
call using the *67 preﬁx successfully masked their caller ID.
This observation is an example of how unsolicited callers can
use existing features in the phone network to evade detection.
As described in Section 2.1, CNAM is a feature through
which a set of 15 characters can be sent to the called party.
When CNAM information is available, it represents the name
of the owner of the calling phone number.
Finding 13: A large number of callers used a small pool of
caller names (CNAM) when making unsolicited phone calls.
From the data collected in our honeypot, we observed that
there were 811,262 unique calling entities who had made an
5https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers
6https://nationalnanpa.com/number_resource_info/index.html
unsolicited call. Each calling entity is uniquely identiﬁed by
a combination of calling party’s phone number and the Caller
ID Name (CNAM). Of these 811,262 (100%) calling entities,
we observed that there were 801,466 (98.79%) unique phone
numbers (caller IDs) and 239,210 (29.49%) unique CNAMs,
which indicates rampant reuse of CNAMs.
4.6 Wangiri Scam Estimation
We studied wangiri scam attempts on 2,949 inbound lines
(RL2) which were conﬁgured to ring for 10 seconds and
answered any unsolicited call. We deﬁned a heuristic and
empirically estimate the scale of wangiri scams. Since all our
inbound lines were located in the United States, the ringing
tone cadence as per ITU speciﬁcations [21] was 2 seconds
ring and 4 seconds silence. A single ring lasted for a duration
of 6 seconds.
In order to compute the estimate of wangiri scam calls in
our honeypot, we identiﬁed any calls that were disconnected
before being answered. Next, we computed the fraction of
these calls which disconnected from the calling side before the
beginning of the second ring — all the calls that disconnected
at or before 6 seconds after the call setup. Since a successful
wangiri scam involves an International or a premium rate
number as the caller ID, we also analyzed the caller ID for
all calls disconnected on or before 6 seconds from the call
attempt.
Finding 14: We found no concrete evidence of wangiri scams
We found that there were 3,213 calls among all the calls
which were prematurely disconnected within 6 seconds. We
analyzed the caller ID for calls that were disconnected before
answering and observed that there were 29 unique instances
of numbers not matching the standard NANP format and were
likely a premium rate number used for Wangiri scams. There
were 4 invalid caller IDs (e.g. “Restricted, *86”) and 2,296
numbers matched the NANP format. Since we found that the
caller IDs for these calls did not match well-known wangiri
NPA — 900, 976 or other Caribbean countries, we report that
there were no instances of wangiri scams observed in our
honeypot.
4.7 Call Audio Characteristics
Among all the data collected in our honeypot, call audio is
