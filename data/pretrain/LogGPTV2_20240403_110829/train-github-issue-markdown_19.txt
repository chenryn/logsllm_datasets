## The Problem
VSCode can nicely handle comments in JSON files. However, the JSON
specification does **not** allow comments in JSON files. Therefore most JSON
parsers fail when JSON files contain comments. E.g. `package.json` fails, and
even the typescript compiler fails on tsconfig.json files that include
comments.
Another problem is that syntax highlighting does not work on github. For
example, the file `extensions/xml/xml.configuration.json` ist not legal JSON.
This is symptomatic for repositories that are managed with VSCode:
  * @dbaeumer in `eslint/.vscode/tasks.json`
  * @weinand in `vscode-node-debug/.vscode/launch.json`
  * @egamma in `vscode-go/blame/master/.vscode/launch.json`
## Proposal: create a new file type, e.g. `.tson`
Instead of misleading people about the syntax of JSON by providing support for
comments in JSON files, VSCode should rather use a new format like `TSON`,
that would be an extension of JSON that allows for comments. There could be a
simpler pre-processor for TSON (like JSON.minify) that converts TSON into JSON
by stripping away the comments.
With such a new file type, VSCode could happily use them without compromising
the integrity of existing `.json` files.
In addition, it would be cool to use typescript ambient definitions for
`.tson` files. I really like the typescript schema for `tasks.json`.
