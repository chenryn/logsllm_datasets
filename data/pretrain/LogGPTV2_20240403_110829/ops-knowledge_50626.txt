User: How to install and configure MySQL database to support user rights management and remote access?
Assistant: To install the MySQL database and configure user rights management and remote access, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Download and install the MySQL server software. You can download the installer from the official website. 2. During the installation process, set a password for the MySQL root user (a strong password is recommended). 3. Start the MySQL server. Under Windows, you can start the MySQL service in the service manager; under Linux, you can use the command systemctl start mysql or service mysql start. 4. Connect to the MySQL server and enter the root user password. 5. Configure user rights management. It is best not to do this with the root user, but to create a new user and grant it the necessary permissions. For example, a new user named test can be created with the following command: CREATE USER 'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'test'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 6 . Enable remote access. By default, MySQL only allows local connections. If you need to connect to the MySQL server from a remote host, you need to modify the MySQL configuration file (my.cnf or my.ini) and turn on the bind-address option. For example, add the following content to the my.cnf file: [mysqld] bind-address = 0.0.0.0 7. Restart the MySQL server. Under Linux, you can use the command systemctl restart mysql or service mysql restart. 8. Confirm whether you can connect to the MySQL server from the remote host. Use the mysql command on the remote host to connect to the MySQL server: mysql -u test -h server_ip_address -p Enter the password to connect to the MySQL server.
