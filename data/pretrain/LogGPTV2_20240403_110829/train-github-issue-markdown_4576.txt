My understanding is that `org.neo4j.server.transaction.timeout` is only for
server mode. I would like to request a timeout feature for embedded mode, to
automatically abort any transaction longer than a given time. Ideally this
could be overridden in an individual transaction. Previously we used the
recommendation here:
http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/10/17/neo4j-setting-query-timeout/
however, from the author's update comment, it seems this no longer works in
Neo4j 2.2+. Maybe the execution guard function was removed? The timeout
workaround we constructed in our own code (following that blog post, in an
earlier Neo4j) does seem broken on Neo4j 2.3+. So we no longer have a way to
catch runaway queries, as far as I know.  
For comparison: Postgres `statement_timeout`
