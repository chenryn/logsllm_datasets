### Introduction

**Story Time:**
Programs like DARE, Every 15, and similar initiatives have been shown to potentially increase alcohol intake. This is a cautionary tale for security programs. Imagine if your security program had the same unintended consequences. I want to help you provide better security guidance.

**About Me:**
I'm Kyle, an enthusiast of harm reduction. Let's explore how we can apply this approach to security.

### Principles of Harm Reduction

1. **Accept that risk-taking behaviors are here to stay.**
2. **Prioritize the reduction of negative consequences.**

### Use Reduction vs. Harm Reduction

**Use Reduction:**
- Focuses on reducing the frequency or amount of risky behavior.
- May add social stigma.
- Can have community impacts.
- May lead to iatrogenesis (harm caused by the treatment itself).

**Harm Reduction:**
- A set of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing the negative consequences associated with various human behaviors.
- Origins in public health, particularly in drug use and HIV prevention.

### Why Harm Reduction?

- **Risk-taking behaviors occur for a reason.**
- **Eradication is not the goal.**
- **Support use reduction with other measures.**
- **Make risky behaviors less risky.**
- **Be pragmatic and reduce unintended consequences.**

### Research Findings

- **Alcohol Prohibition:**
  - Initial 70% reduction in consumption receded to 30% over time.
  - Annual enforcement costs rose from $6M to $13M.

- **Teenage Pregnancy Prevention:**
  - Abstinence-based programs funded by Title V of the Social Security Act showed no significant impact on stopping or delaying sex.

- **War on Drugs:**
  - Over $1 trillion spent since 1971.
  - Has not eradicated drug trade and may have increased it.

- **D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education):**
  - Research shows it was ineffective and in some cases increased future harmful behaviors.

### Examples in Security

- **Phishing Susceptibility:**
  - "Training efforts do not eradicate phishing susceptibility." — Lain, Kostiainen, and Capkun

- **Password Reuse:**
  - "People re-use complex passwords. People re-use frequently used passwords." — Wash, Rader, Berman, & Wellmer, SOUPS 2016

### Combining Harm Reduction and Use Reduction

- **E-cigarettes in UK vs. USA:**
  - USA: High concentration, marketing to minors, black market products, >50 deaths.
  - UK: Lower concentration, youth usage 4x lower, used in smoking cessation, 0 deaths.

- **Virginity Pledges:**
  - Teens who pledge are equally likely to have sex but less likely to use contraception and test for STDs.

- **Syringe Exchange Programs:**
  - Reduce new HIV infections by 70%.
  - Safe injection sites decrease overdoses by 35%.
  - Access to Naloxone reduces overdoses by 11%.

### Practical Security Guidance

- **Never include your face.**
- **Use secret chats with self-destructing messages.**
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): TOTP > SMS > Nothing.**

**Approach:**
- Don't do that.
- Try not to do that, but if you do, here are some ways to be safe.

### The Importance of Compassion

- **Stigma and Confrontation:**
  - Can break down defenses and increase harm.
  - Shaming and stigmatizing reduce efficacy and increase harm.

- **Compassion:**
  - Improves trust and reduces harm.
  - Encourages positive change through collaboration, accessibility, and kindness.
  - Caring for people who make high-risk choices can motivate them to make better choices.
  - Reduces burnout and improves practitioner efficacy.

### Research on Compassion

- **Shaming and Stigmatizing:**
  - Scared Straight increased crime among participants by up to 28%.
  - HIV-related stigma causes lower rates of testing and treatment engagement.
  - Obesity-related stigma reduces motivation and engagement in treatment.

- **Compassionate Care:**
  - Diabetes patients with compassionate doctors showed increased adherence to guidance and better health outcomes.
  - Patients who trust their physicians show 47% less brain activity in pain centers.

- **Practitioner Effectiveness:**
  - Non-adherence to healthcare guidance costs the USA $100-$300 billion annually.
  - Compassionate communication leads to 62% higher odds of patient adherence to treatment.
  - Doctors with poor patient relationships are 22x more likely to experience burnout.

### Concluding Thoughts

- **Harm reduction is effective in healthcare.**
- **Incorporating harm reduction can lead to:**
  - Improved efficacy.
  - Reduced costs.
  - Reduced burnout.

- **Remember the harm reduction framework:**
  1. Accept that risk-taking behaviors are here to stay.
