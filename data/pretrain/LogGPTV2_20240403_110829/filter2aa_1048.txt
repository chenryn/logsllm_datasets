Story time
DARE, Every 15, and similar programs 
likely increase alcohol intake. 
Why am I telling you this?
Imagine that was your security program
I want to help you give 
better security guidance
I’m Kyle, harm reduction enthusiast
1. Accept that risk taking behaviors are here to stay
2. Prioritize reduction of negative consequences
3. Embrace compassion while providing guidance
Let’s talk security guidance
Example #1
Example #2
Example #3
This is use reduction
What’s the harm?
Nothing done about original incentives
Use reduction may add social stigma
Behaviors may have community impact
Iatrogenesis
Harm Reduction Enters The Chat
Defining Harm Reduction:
A set of practical strategies and ideas aimed 
at reducing the negative consequences 
associated with various human behaviors
Origins of Harm Reduction
Note: use reduction still relevant
Applying Harm Reduction to Security
1. Accept that risk taking 
behaviors are here to stay
2. Prioritize reduction of negative consequences
3. Embrace compassion while providing guidance
Why?
Risk taking behaviors occur for a reason
Use Reduction Is Not Efficient
Use reduction programs can have 
unintended consequences.
Iron Law of Prohibition
Abstinence violation effect
What does the research show?
●
Alcohol Prohibition
○
Initial drop of 70% receded to 30% reduction over time. 
○
Annual enforcement costs rose from $6M to $13M 
●
Teenage Pregnancy Prevention
○
Title V of the Social Security Act effectively guarantees >$100 Million for abstinence based pregnancy 
prevention 
○
6 years of congressional research found no program had any significant impact on stopping or delaying sex.
●
War on drugs
○
Since 1971 the United States spent >  $1 trillion dollars 
○
Has not eradicated drug trade, potentially increased it.
●
D.A.R.E.
○
Drug Abuse and Resistance Education program 
○
Research shows it was entirely ineffective and in many cases increasing future harmful behaviors.
Accept that eradication is not the goal
Support use reduction with other measures
Make risky behaviors less risky
Be pragmatic, reduce unintended 
consequences
Example #1
Example #2
Example #3
“Training efforts do not eradicate phishing 
susceptibility.”
Lain, Kostiainen, and Capkun
“People re-use complex passwords.
People re-use frequently used passwords.”
Wash, Rader, Berman, & Wellmer 
SOUPS 2016
1. Accept that risk taking behaviors are here to stay
2. Prioritize reduction of negative 
consequences
3. Embrace compassion while providing guidance
Why?
Eradication is not possible
Individuals who cannot abstain take risks for 
themselves AND the population 
Risk is not binary. It exists on a spectrum.
Any steps on risk spectrum towards lower 
harm are valuable
Feasible + pragmatic + effective 
Harm reduction & use reduction 
work together
What does the research show?
●
E-cigarettes in UK v USA
○
USA banned. UK regulated. 
○
In USA: High concentration, marketing to minors, black market products, > 50 deaths
○
In UK: Lower concentration, Youth usage 4x lower, used in smoking cessation, 0 deaths 
●
Virginity pledges
○
Teens who pledge equally likely to have sex
○
Teens who pledge less likely to use contraception, less likely to test for STDs, have STDs for longer
●
War on Drugs (the birthplace of harm reduction)
○
Syringe sharing reduces new HIV infections by 70%
○
Safe injection sites decrease overdoses by 35%
○
Access to Naloxone reduces overdoses by 11%
Use reduction must be supported with 
additional strategies
Design treatments that reduce that harm  
Similar to defense in depth
Example #1
Example #2
Example #3
“Never include your face”
“Make sure that your 
communications are in 
a secret chat with 
self-destructing 
messages set to a 
short timeframe.”
2FA: TOTP > SMS > Nothing
Don’t do that
Try not to do that, but if you do then here are 
some ways to be safe
1. Accept that risk taking behaviors are here to stay
2. Prioritize reduction of negative consequences
3. Embrace compassion while 
providing guidance
Why?
There is stigma associated with 
high risk behaviors
Stigmatizing can break down defenses
Empathy & compassion > confrontation 
Compassion includes
improving quality of life
Encourage change through collaboration, 
accessibility, and kindness
People make positive choices when they 
have access to support and education 
Caring for people who make high risk choices 
can motivate them to make better choices
Caring for people is more fun, it reduces 
burnout and improves practitioner efficacy 
What does the research show?
●
Shaming and stigmatizing reduce efficacy, increase harm
○
Scared straight increased crime amongst participants up to 28%
○
HIV-related stigma causes lower rates of testing, treatment engagement, and medication adherence.
○
Obesity-related stigma reduces motivation, and engagement in treatment, increasing weight and obesity related health 
problems. 
●
Compassionate care improves trust, reduces harm
○
Diabetes patients with compassionate doctors showed increased adherence to guidance, 40% less likely to have 
complications, 80% more likely to have optimal blood sugar control
○
Patients who trust their physicians show 47% less brain activity in pain centers
●
Compassion makes practitioners more effective
○
Non-adherence to health care guidance costs USA $100-$300 billion annually. 
○
Compassionate communication leads to 62% higher odds of patient adherence to treatment
○
Doctors with poor patient relationships 22x more likely to experience burnout, burnout reduces quality in 33% of all 
doctors.
Confrontation & shaming makes security 
practitioners less effective  
Compassion will make security
practitioners more effective
Replacing conflicts with empathy will reduce 
burnout
Example #1
Example #2
Example #3
“Hitch your wagon to developer productivity” 
Astha Singhal, AppSec Cali 2019
“Knowledge Shaming Is Making Us Less Secure”
Regina Blumen, Blackhat EU 2021
Concluding thoughts
Harm reduction is effective in healthcare
Incorporate harm reduction and 
you could see: 
● improved efficacy
● reduced costs
● reduced burnout
Remember the harm reduction framework:
1. Accept that risk taking behaviors are here to stay
2. Prioritize reduction of negative consequences
3. Embrace compassion while providing guidance
Wherever risk exists on a spectrum
harm reduction has a place
Don’t do that
Try not to, but if you do then here are some 
ways to be safe
