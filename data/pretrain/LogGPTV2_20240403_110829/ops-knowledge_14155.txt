User: Please design a high-concurrency load balancing system that can effectively distribute user requests and ensure system stability.
Assistant: For a high-concurrency load balancing system, we can consider the following aspects for design: 1. Front-end load balancing: It can be realized by using Nginx or other open source load balancing software to distribute user requests to multiple back-end servers. 2. Back-end load balancing: In the back-end server, we can use the consistent hash algorithm or other load balancing algorithms to further distribute requests to different servers. 3. Smart DNS: Through the smart DNS system, user requests can be distributed to the nearest server, thereby reducing network delays. 4. Security: In order to ensure the stability of the system, certain security mechanisms are required, such as firewalls, DDoS attack protection and other measures. 5. Monitoring: In order to ensure the reliability of the system, it is necessary to monitor the system load, performance and other indicators in real time, and to report to the police in time. 6. Horizontal expansion: At the same time, in order to cope with higher concurrent users, it is also necessary to design the system to facilitate horizontal expansion, and to share the load by increasing the number of servers and resources.
