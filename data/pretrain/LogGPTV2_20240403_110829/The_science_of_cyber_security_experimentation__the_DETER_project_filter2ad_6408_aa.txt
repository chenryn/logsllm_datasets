ABSTRACT 
Since  2004,  the  DETER  Cyber-security  Project  has  worked  to 
create an evolving infrastructure – facilities, tools, and processes – 
to  provide  a  national  resource  for  experimentation  in  cyber 
security.  Building  on  our  insights  into  requirements  for  cyber 
science and on lessons learned through 8 years of operation, we 
have  made  several  transformative  advances  towards  creating  the 
next  generation  of  DeterLab.  These  advances  in  experiment 
design  and  research  methodology  are  yielding  progressive 
improvements not only in experiment scale, complexity, diversity, 
and repeatability, but also in the ability of researchers to leverage 
prior  experimental  efforts  of  other  researchers  in  the  DeterLab 
user community. This paper describes the advances resulting in a 
new experimentation science and a transformed facility for cyber-
security research development and evaluation.

1.  INTRODUCTION: THE DETER 
PROJECT 
DETER  is  a  research  project  that  is  advancing  cyber  security 
research  practices,  by  extending  the  methods,  technology,  and 
infrastructure required for scientific development of cyber-defense 
technology [1], [2]. Our research results are put into practice  by 
operating  and  evolving  DeterLab,  transforming  it  from  a  basic 
hardware-focused network security testbed within the early phase 
of the project, through the shared experiment and testing lab of the 
middle phase of DeterLab use, towards a new kind of facility for

the 
their  work  of  developing 
cyber-security experimental science. 
Our  vision  for  the  next  iteration  of  DeterLab  is  a  facility  that  is 
used  as  a  scientific 
instrument,  where  researchers  create 
knowledge and understanding through observation, modeling, and 
measurement of computer and cyber security threats and defenses. 
We are actively engaged in research and development to improve 
the  scope  and  usability  of  this  instrument,  throughout  the  life 
cycle of an experiment – definition, execution, and interpretation. 
An  additional  and  fundamental  goal  is  that  the  scientific  facility 
will be to support diverse research communities, and enable users 
to  contribute  to  and  leverage  a  common  body  of  tools  and 
knowledge. That leverage will enable researchers to build on one 
another's  experimental  work,  with  reproducible  experiments  and 
repeatable experimental procedures. 
We believe that this evolution of DeterLab will enable shifting the 
science  of  cyber  security  experimentation  towards  rigorous 
design, construction, execution, and interpretation of experiments. 
Such a shift is required to advance the scale, pace, and power of 
cyber-security  research,  and  to  expand  the  research  community 
and  accelerate 
innovative, 
scientifically  tested,  and  demonstrably  effective  new  cyber-
defenses required to meet challenges ranging from personal digital 
security to national-scale critical infrastructure protection. 
In pursuit of this goal, the DETER project's research program has 
been influenced by several lessons learned from our experiences 
in  evolving  DeterLab,  and  from  supporting  and  interacting  with 
many  researchers  using  DeterLab.  Those  lessons  have  driven 
several  new  areas  of  work  on  developing  cyber-security  science 
methods  and 
techniques, 
methodology, resources, and facilities that are needed to provide 
DeterLab researchers with major advances in their scientific and 
experimental  capabilities:  repeatable,  flexible,  and  variable 
experimentation, discovery, observation, and testing. 
This paper provides: some background motivation and history for 
the  DETER  project;  a  review  of  our  key  advances  in  creating  a 
science  of  experimentation,  and  lessons  learned  from  these 
advances;  a  description  of  the  current  DETER  research  program 
and  roadmap;  and  a  prognosis  for  the  use  in  DeterLab  of  the 
resulting  innovations  in  cyber-security  research  practices  and 
infrastructure,  as  we  progress  toward  our  vision  of  a  new 
environment  and  community  for  science  based  cyber  security 
experimentation and test. 
2.  BACKGROUND: MOTIVATION AND 
HISTORY 
The  DETER  project’s  creation  grew  out  of  a  set  of  related

Security  technology  and  development  was  largely  re-
active in nature. 
Security  technology  development  was  slower  in  pace 
than the evolution of existing threats and the emergence 
of new threats.

equipment at small scale. 
Emerging  threats,  not  addressed  by  deployed  security 
technology,  operate  at  Internet  scale  (worms,  DDOS); 
requiring  radically  new  classes  of  defense,  and  hence 
radically  new  evaluation  strategies  for  these  defenses, 
that focus on scale and aggregate behavior.

•  New  security  approaches  (e.g.,  behavioral  anomaly 
analysis) also need large scale and highly varied testing.

A  consequence  of  these  observations  was  that  promising  new 
security  technologies,  often  from  innovators  with  limited  testing 
resources, 
tested  by  applied  security 
practitioners in real deployment environments. [3] In such cases, 
technology  transfer  was  problematic  because  of  significantly 
lower effectiveness outside the innovator’s limited test facility. In 
many  cases,  commercial  organizations  did  not  find  it  cost

effectiveness.  
With this background in 2001-2002, one of the several factors of 
cyber-security  deficiency  seemed  to  be  addressable:  the  lack  of 
testing facilities with significantly greater resources and flexibility 
than the limited test environments of most innovators, and greater 
fidelity to real deployment environments. One DARPA-sponsored 
report [4] called for and stated requirements for a national cyber-
defense technology test facility. One result of that report was the 
impetus  for  funders  at  NSF  and  DHS  to  define  and  fund  the 
project that was the first phase of DETER. 
The initial focus of DETER was to build such a national testbed, 
enabling cyber security innovators to test new technology at larger 
scale,  with  more  complex  test  fixtures,  assembled  to  be  more 
representative  of  real  deployment  environments.  The  first-phase 
DETER project (led by USC/ISI, UC Berkeley, and Sparta, Inc.) 
was funded by two NSF programs – Experimental Infrastructure 
Network (EIN) and Network Research Testbeds (NRT) – and by 
DHS.  At  the  same  time  EIN  and  NRT  co-funded  the  EMIST 
project,  composed  of  researchers  from  Penn  State,  McAfee 
Research,  ICSI,  Purdue,  Sparta,  Inc.,  SRI  International,  and  UC 
Davis. EMIST researchers were to use the DETER testbed, help 
build  knowledge  about  researcher’s  needs  based  on  experience 
working in the testbed, and build experience with existing testing 
tools used in the testbed. Together these efforts led to the success 
of  the  first  phase  of  DETER,  with  the  assembly  of  the  network 
and  physical  resources,  development  of  controls  and  user 
interfaces  for  experimenters,  assessment  and  integration  of 
via 
scaling 
hypervisor 
existing  tools,  and  the  creation  of  a  collaborative  community  of 
researchers. 
The testbed became operational in March 2004. The first DETER 
Community Workshop was held in November 2004, with working 
groups  of  researchers  who  published  refereed  publications  on 
work  performed  in  the  DETER  testbed  covering,  e.g.,  DDOS 
defense [5], worm dynamics [6], worm defense [7], and detection 
of  routing  infrastructure  attacks  [8].  The  ensuing  years  saw 
maturation of the testbed through use and expansion, and growth 
of  the  research  community  with  a  greatly  increased  breadth  of 
activity.  Both  DETER  researchers  and  community  collaborators 
worked  on  research  topics  in  the  technology  for  supporting  and 
enabling  cyber-security  research  work:  experiment  automation, 
benchmarking, 
usage,  malware 
containment, and our initial work on federation [9], now a central 
component of DeterLab technology. 
In  the  second  phase  of  DETER,  2007-9,  the  results  of  this 
“research  on  research”  –  our  exploration  of  novel  technologies 
and  methodologies  for  cyber-security  research  –  were  put  into 
practice in the testbed, which was also expanded in capacity. The 
result was the evolution from the DETER testbed to DeterLab, a 
shared virtual lab composed of the underlying testbed resources, 
technology for using and managing the resources as test fixtures, 
and  a  growing  variety  of  tools  and  services  for  experiment 
support,  including  the  full-support  release  of  the  federation 
capability,  and  the  first-generation  experimenters’  workbench, 
SEER  [10].  
With  the  technological  maturity  achieved  in  this  phase,  and  the 
experience  gained  from  supporting  over  1000  researcher  team 
members, the stage was set for DETER project activities to focus 
increasingly  on  research  and  development  in  the  areas  of  cyber-
security  experimentation  methodology, 
tools, 
resource  expansion,  utilization 
innovations,  and  other  new 
methods of using DeterLab for scientific experimentation.  
The experience during this phase included several lessons learned 
that provided important guidance for the current DETER research 
program.  The  balance  of  this  paper  describes  five  significant 
lessons  learned,  and  outlines  the  current  research  program 
developed  from  the  combination  of  our  vision  of  an  advanced 
scientific  instrument,  and  lessons  learned  from  the  developing 
community. 
3.  LESSONS LEARNED: CHALLENGES 
FOR SCIENCE BASED 
EXPERIMENTATION 
Here  we  describe  several  lessons  learned  from  early  experience 
with  DETER.  These  lessons  derive  from  observing  norms  of 
researcher activity that emerged in the 2nd phase of DeterLab use. 
Those norms included some basic terms and a typical workflow. 
Researchers  working 
in  DeterLab  are  called  “users”  or 
“experimenters”.  A  team  of  users  working  together  is  called  a 
“project.” The focus of activity of a project is a construct called an 
“experiment” – a term that applies whether the construct is used in 
the  strict  sense  as  part  of  activity  to  prove  or  disprove  a 
hypothesis, or the construct is used for broader purposes such as 
observing  malware  behavior,  measuring  the  effect  of  counter-
measures,  or  other  forms  of  testing  or  observation  that  could 
contribute 
formation  or  demonstration  of 
effectiveness of a counter-measure. 
The  concept  of  an  “experiment”  is  broad.  In  DeterLab’s 
vernacular the term “experiment” is used at minimum, to describe 
to  hypothesis 
infrastructure, 
to 
tools 
this  workflow  as 
the  experimental  apparatus  or  environment  that  users  have 
constructed  from  computing  and  network  resources,  hosts, 
software,  test  fixtures,  measurement  tools,  and  other  fixtures  or 
components of a system that experimenters operate. Beyond this, 
“experiment” is also frequently used to describe the experimental 
procedures and experimenter activity to interact with an apparatus 
in operation, and to review results of operation – that is, the entire 
“experimental protocol” for a particular research activity.
