As discussed, it may be time to consider refactoring the `Request` and `Response` classes to adhere to the PHP-FIG (PHP Framework Interoperability Group) standards. You can review the relevant interfaces [here](link_to_interfaces).

Message from @iltar:
> I have been considering converting the current `Request` and `Response` objects into builders. Parameter converters and other functionalities currently work by setting values, and the same applies to response listeners. By transforming the `ResponseBuilder` and `RequestBuilder` into "frozen" variants, they can be made compliant with PSR (PHP Standard Recommendations). This means that when you modify the request builder, it will generate a PSR-compliant request object for your action. Similarly, for the response, you can return a `Response(Builder)`, which will be converted to a PSR-compliant `Response` if it is not already.

This approach would allow for better interoperability and adherence to established standards, ensuring that the `Request` and `Response` objects are consistent and compatible with other PHP frameworks and libraries.
