ABSTRACT
The internet and related technologies have made multido-
main collaborations a reality. Collaboration enables do-
mains to eﬀectively share resources; however it introduces
several security and privacy challenges. Managing security
in the absence of a central mediator is even more challenging.
In this paper, we propose a distributed secure interoperabil-
ity framework for mediator-free collaboration environments.
We introduce the idea of secure access paths which enables
domains to make localized access control decisions without
having global view of the collaboration. We also present a
path authentication technique for proving path authenticity.
Furthermore, we present both a proactive and on-demand
path discovery algorithms that enable domains to securely
discover paths in the collaboration environment.

INTRODUCTION
The phenomenal growth of the Internet has enabled a
globalization that has removed barriers between markets,
organizations and societies. The Internet has become in-
tegrated into practices of individuals, business, and gov-
ernments.
In such a connected world, there are immense
possibilities of collaboration in distributed environments.
For example, interoperability has enabled companies to out-
source their operations overseas to reduce production and

employment costs. Furthermore, interoperability adds to
the eﬃciency of companies by leveraging the use of exist-
ing resources other than reinventing the wheel. Even more
interestingly, by migrating processes across organizational
boundaries companies are able to combine their eﬀorts and
become virtual enterprises [1, 17]. Last but not least inter-
operability is essential to support adaptation and evolution
in complex enterprises [8]. Such enterprises [21] are orga-
nized according to units with varying degrees of coupling
and autonomous coordination linking these units. As such
an enterprise evolves to meet new demands, new interop-
eration links across units may need to be established and
existing links removed.
Though interoperability has several advantages and is cru-
cial in the context of new dynamic collaborative applica-
tions and adaptive enterprises, it introduces several security
and privacy concerns. These concerns have to be addressed
to make such interoperability techniques a viable tool in
multidomain contexts.
In particular, a domain represents
a core element in a collaborating environment. A domain
is a separate, autonomous entity that manages a group of
resources, and has its own administration and access control
policies. Because very often domains need to collaborate to
share resources, a key step in setting up such a collabora-
tion among domains is represented by the interoperation of
access control policies. Domains typically achieve interop-
eration among their access control policies by introducing
cross mappings between these policies. An important re-
quirement is that such interoperation of policies be secure;
Gong and Qian [12], among others, have shown that if in-
teroperation between access control policies is not carefully
established, security breaches may arise.
Secure interoperability in a multidomain environment is
a challenging task even in the presence of a trusted media-
tor managing security of such collaboration [12, 4, 7]. It is
much harder to handle security in a fully distributed and dy-
namic interoperation environment where domains join and
leave in an adhoc manner and in the absence of a trusted
mediator. However, we believe that the development of fully
decentralized solutions tailored to dynamic environments is
crucial to meet the security requirements of next-generation
enterprises.
In this paper we develop such a solution. We propose
a distributed framework addressing both the security and
autonomy requirements of domains in a mediator-free inter-
operation environment. In our framework the user’s access
history migrates with the user’s access requests to enable
domains to make localized access control decisions without
58needing to have a global view of the collaboration environ-
ment. We deﬁne a set of basic and extended path linking
rules that enable domains to make access control decisions.
We also provide a path authentication technique that en-
sures the authenticity of the user’s access path as it propa-
gates between domains. Our framework provides both reac-
tive and on-demand path discovery algorithms that enable
users to discover available secure access paths in the inter-
operation environment.
1.1 Contributions and Paper Organization
The contributions in this paper can be summarized as
follows:
• We present a mediator-free collaboration environment
and discuss the security challenges in such an environ-
ment. We deﬁne access paths and present access path
security requirements in a secure collaboration.
• We provide a framework for enabling secure collabo-
ration in a mediator-free environment, in which access
control decisions are dependent on the user’s access
history in the collaboration environment.
• We discuss several security attacks that can be per-
formed in a mediator-free environment, and provide
mitigation techniques to such attacks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec-
tion 2 we review the requirements of secure interoperability,
the maximal secure interoperability and the drawbacks of
the maximal secure interoperability solution proposed by Li
and Qian [12]. We introduce the mediator-free collaboration
environment in Section 3. In Section 4 we present our frame-
work for secure collaboration in a mediator-free environment
and deﬁne the notion of secure access path. The request
execution strategy and path authentication module are dis-
cussed in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. The proactive and
on-demand path discovery algorithms are presented on Sec-
tion 7. Possible security attacks and mitigation techniques
are discussed in Section 8. The related work is presented in
Section 9. Concluding remarks are added in Section 10.
2. PRELIMINARIES
In our framework, we assume that all the domains adopt
a role-based access control (RBAC) model [10, 9] to model
their access control policies. The analysis performed in this
paper and the framework we have developed can still be ap-
plied when other access control models are adopted. We
have chosen RBAC because it is suitable for specifying the
security requirements for a wide range of commercial, med-
ical, government applications [23, 3] and moreover it is be-
ing standardized. A domain that does not use RBAC as its
access control model can easily generate an export RBAC
policy to join the collaboration.
In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users
are granted membership in appropriate roles, thereby ac-
quiring the roles’ permissions. The access control policy P Oi
for domain i is modeled as a directed graph Gi = hVi, Aii
where the vertex set Vi represents roles and the arcs set Ai
represents the dominance relationship between roles. For ex-
ample, if role r1 dominates r2, (r2 (cid:22) r1), then (r1, r2) ∈ Ai.
Thus a user acquiring role r1 can acquire permissions as-
signed to role r2 by using the RBAC permission inheritance
properties [6]. For rx, ry ∈ Vi an access (rx, ry) is legal if
and only if (rx, ry) ∈ G+
is the transitive closure
of Gi = hVi, Aii. We denote a legal access by (rx, ry) ∝ Ai.
2.1 Secure Interoperability
i where G+
i
In a collaboration involving n domains, in which the ac-
cess control policy of each domain i is modeled as a di-
rected graph Gi = hVi, Aii, i = 1, . . . , n, interoperability
is achieved by introducing cross domain pairwise mappings
between the n domains. These mappings relate roles in dif-
ferent domains, and are represented by a set of cross do-
main arcs referred to as the set F . Solutions developed for
schema matching in the area of heterogeneous database sys-
tems and more recently approaches based on ontologies [19,
18] can be used for generating such links. The details of
such approaches are outside of the scope of this paper. In
the present work we assume that the cross domain map-
pings are selected by the administrators of the domains
according to the interoperability requirements of each sys-
tem. Furthermore, the system administrators agree on a
set of restricted accesses which is similar to negative au-
thorizations adopted in several access control models. The
n
restricted access is a binary relation R on
i=1 Vi such that
∀(u, v) ∈ R, u ∈ Vi, v ∈ Vj , and i 6= j, where these edges in
R are prohibited to exist during interoperation.
S
Given n domains Gi = hVi, Aii, i = 1, . . . , n, set of cross
links F and a restricted access relation R, an interoperation
Q = h∪n
i=1Vi, AQi, where AQ is the resulting arc set AQ ⊆
{∪n
i=1Ai ∪ F } , is secure according to Li Gong et al. [12] if
it satisﬁes all the following conditions:
1. AQ ∩ R = ∅.
2. ∀u, v ∈ Vi, (u, v) is legal in Ai if and only if (u, v) is
legal in AQ.
The ﬁrst requirement ensures that restricted access rela-
tion is honored. The second requirement ensures the follow-
ing two properties hold:
• Autonomy:
It requires that any access permitted
with in an individual domain must also be permitted
under secure interoperation.
• Security: It requires that any access denied within an
individual domain must also be denied under secure
interoperation.
2.2 The Maximum Secure Interoperation (MSI)
Deﬁnition 1. Maximum Secure Interoperability (MSI)
Given n domains Gi = hVi, Aii, i = 1, . . . , n, a set of cross
links F and a restricted access relation R, for any positive
integer K ≤ |F |, determine whether a secure solution Q =
h∪n
i=1Ai ∪ S} where
S ⊆ F and |S| ≥ K.
i=1Vi, AQi exists such that AQ = {∪n
Simply, the MSI solution ﬁnds a maximal subset of the
cross links set F such that the secure interoperability is en-
sured. The MSI solution inherently satisﬁes the autonomy
requirement as AQ = {∪n
i=1Ai ∪ S}. Taking a closer look at
the MSI solution we conclude it has the following drawbacks:
• NP-Completeness: Li Gong et al. [12] showed a
polynomial reduction of the Feedback Arc Set prob-
lem, which is a known NP-complete problem, to the
59MSI problem, thus proving that MSI is an NP-complete
problem. Thus it is not practical to solve the MSI
problem for a large number of collaborating domains.
Moreover, any practical solution to this problem would
be based on heuristics and in such cases the generated
solutions are approximate and are not guaranteed to
be optimal.
• Centralized Algorithm: The MSI problem assumes
full knowledge all domains’ access control policies Gi =
hVi, Aii, i = 1, . . . , n, and the sets F and R. To solve
the MSI problem a global view of the system is re-
quired. A trusted mediator having the global view
computes the subset of F that satisﬁes the constraints
of MSI. The mediator represents a bottleneck and there-
fore such solution is not scalable in distributed envi-
ronments with a large number of interacting parties.
• Static Solution: The MSI solution computed with n
collaborating domains is optimal and secure for these
n domains; if however a domain decides to leave or
join the collaboration, the MSI solution has to be re-
computed to ensure both optimality and security. Fur-
thermore, the MSI solution should be recomputed if a
domain edits or updates its security policy. This is not
practical in dynamic environments in which domains
are required to join and leave the interoperation en-
vironment transparently without the need for delays
and revocations of current coalitions.
• Fairness Issue: The MSI solution resolves violations
by removing cross links from F . However, in a vio-
lation several domains are involved and the removal
of cross links will aﬀect a subset of these domains.
The following example elaborates on the fairness is-
sue. Consider Figure 1 where domains A, B and C
are collaborating. Each domain has an access control
hierarchy represented as a graph. The cross links are
represented by the dotted lines. A user in domain A
acquiring role rA1 could access role rA3 by accessing
roles {rB3 , rB1 , rC2 , rC1 , rA3 } which is clearly a secu-
rity violation as rA1 (cid:22) rA3 . Furthermore, using a sim-
ilar argument a user at rB1 and rC1 could access roles
rB3 and rC2 respectively. The MSI solution would re-
move one or more cross links to break such cycle. As-
sume that the MSI solution removes edge (rC1 , rA3 );
this solution eliminates the security violation but users
in domain C are unable to access roles in domain A.
This solution is not fair as it restricts access by users
of domain C, whereas rights of users in other domains
are not aﬀected.
From the above discussion we conclude that the MSI solu-
tion is NP-Complete, requires a trusted mediator, is static,
and moreover it is not fair to all the participating domains.
In the next sections we propose a secure technique which
represents a computationally simple, distributed, dynamic
solution, and ensures fairness to the participating domains.

a global view in order to ensure secure interoperability. Fig-
ure 2 shows both types of collaboration environments. To
design a mediator-free environment we need to analyze the
functions performed by the mediator, which include:
• MSI computation: From the global view the medi-
ator computes the MSI solution, which generates the
optimal set of collaboration cross links between the
domains.
• Role Querying and Routing: By using the global
view of the collaboration environment the mediator
is able to answer queries of the form “is r2 reachable
from r1?” where r1 and r2 are in diﬀerent domains.
Furthermore, the mediator can easily determine paths
between reachable roles in diﬀerent domains.

A mediator-free collaboration is a completely distributed
form of collaboration. In this environment the domains have
to collaborate in making access control decisions to avoid vi-
olations. In a mediator-free environment none of the collab-
orating domains has the global view of all the access control
policies; instead the domains view the collaboration envi-
ronment only through their established cross links. Enforc-
ing secure interoperability in such an environment is a chal-
lenging task as it requires domains to collaborate in both
sharing of resources and making access control decisions. In
a mediator-free secure collaboration the mediator functions
should be executed across the collaborating domains accord-
ing to a distributed strategy.
