## Abstract
The internet and related technologies have made multi-domain collaborations a reality. While collaboration enables effective resource sharing, it introduces significant security and privacy challenges. Managing security in the absence of a central mediator is particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a distributed secure interoperability framework for mediator-free collaboration environments. We introduce the concept of secure access paths, which allows domains to make localized access control decisions without requiring a global view of the collaboration. Additionally, we present a path authentication technique to ensure path authenticity. We also develop both proactive and on-demand path discovery algorithms to enable domains to securely discover paths in the collaboration environment.

## 1. Introduction
The phenomenal growth of the Internet has enabled globalization, breaking down barriers between markets, organizations, and societies. The Internet has become integrated into the practices of individuals, businesses, and governments. In such a connected world, there are immense possibilities for collaboration in distributed environments. For example, interoperability has enabled companies to outsource operations overseas, reducing production and employment costs. Furthermore, interoperability enhances efficiency by leveraging existing resources rather than reinventing the wheel. By migrating processes across organizational boundaries, companies can combine their efforts and form virtual enterprises [1, 17]. Interoperability is also essential for supporting adaptation and evolution in complex enterprises [8].

However, while interoperability offers many advantages, it also introduces several security and privacy concerns that need to be addressed to make it a viable tool in multidomain contexts. A domain in a collaborating environment is a separate, autonomous entity that manages a group of resources and has its own administration and access control policies. To share resources, domains often need to collaborate, and a key step in setting up such a collaboration is the interoperation of access control policies. Domains typically achieve interoperation by introducing cross mappings between these policies. It is crucial that such interoperation be secure; otherwise, security breaches may arise [12].

Secure interoperability in a multidomain environment is challenging, even with a trusted mediator managing the collaboration [12, 4, 7]. It is even more difficult in a fully distributed and dynamic interoperation environment where domains join and leave in an ad-hoc manner and no trusted mediator is available. However, we believe that developing fully decentralized solutions tailored to dynamic environments is crucial to meet the security requirements of next-generation enterprises.

In this paper, we propose a distributed framework addressing the security and autonomy requirements of domains in a mediator-free interoperation environment. Our framework allows users' access history to migrate with their access requests, enabling domains to make localized access control decisions without needing a global view of the collaboration environment. We define basic and extended path linking rules and provide a path authentication technique to ensure the authenticity of the user's access path. Our framework also includes both reactive and on-demand path discovery algorithms to enable users to discover available secure access paths in the interoperation environment.

## 2. Preliminaries
In our framework, we assume that all domains adopt a role-based access control (RBAC) model [10, 9] to model their access control policies. Although the analysis and framework can be applied to other access control models, we chose RBAC because it is suitable for specifying security requirements for a wide range of commercial, medical, and government applications [23, 3] and is being standardized. A domain that does not use RBAC can generate an export RBAC policy to join the collaboration.

In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users are granted membership in appropriate roles, thereby acquiring the roles' permissions. The access control policy \( P_O^i \) for domain \( i \) is modeled as a directed graph \( G_i = (V_i, A_i) \), where the vertex set \( V_i \) represents roles and the arc set \( A_i \) represents the dominance relationship between roles. For example, if role \( r_1 \) dominates \( r_2 \) (\( r_2 \leq r_1 \)), then \( (r_1, r_2) \in A_i \). Thus, a user acquiring role \( r_1 \) can acquire permissions assigned to role \( r_2 \) using the RBAC permission inheritance properties [6]. For \( r_x, r_y \in V_i \), an access \( (r_x, r_y) \) is legal if and only if \( (r_x, r_y) \in G_i^+ \), where \( G_i^+ \) is the transitive closure of \( G_i = (V_i, A_i) \). We denote a legal access by \( (r_x, r_y) \propto A_i \).

### 2.1 Secure Interoperability
In a collaboration involving \( n \) domains, each with an access control policy modeled as a directed graph \( G_i = (V_i, A_i) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \), interoperability is achieved by introducing cross-domain pairwise mappings between the \( n \) domains. These mappings relate roles in different domains and are represented by a set of cross-domain arcs, denoted as \( F \). Solutions for schema matching in heterogeneous database systems and approaches based on ontologies [19, 18] can be used to generate such links. In this work, we assume that the cross-domain mappings are selected by the administrators of the domains according to the interoperability requirements of each system. Additionally, the system administrators agree on a set of restricted accesses, similar to negative authorizations in several access control models. The restricted access is a binary relation \( R \) on \( \bigcup_{i=1}^n V_i \) such that \( \forall (u, v) \in R \), \( u \in V_i \), \( v \in V_j \), and \( i \neq j \), where these edges in \( R \) are prohibited during interoperation.

Given \( n \) domains \( G_i = (V_i, A_i) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \), a set of cross-links \( F \), and a restricted access relation \( R \), an interoperation \( Q = (\bigcup_{i=1}^n V_i, A_Q) \), where \( A_Q \) is the resulting arc set \( A_Q \subseteq \{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \cup F\} \), is secure according to Li Gong et al. [12] if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. \( A_Q \cap R = \emptyset \).
2. \( \forall u, v \in V_i \), \( (u, v) \) is legal in \( A_i \) if and only if \( (u, v) \) is legal in \( A_Q \).

The first requirement ensures that the restricted access relation is honored. The second requirement ensures two properties:
- **Autonomy:** Any access permitted within an individual domain must also be permitted under secure interoperation.
- **Security:** Any access denied within an individual domain must also be denied under secure interoperation.

### 2.2 The Maximum Secure Interoperation (MSI)
**Definition 1.** Maximum Secure Interoperability (MSI): Given \( n \) domains \( G_i = (V_i, A_i) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \), a set of cross-links \( F \), and a restricted access relation \( R \), for any positive integer \( K \leq |F| \), determine whether a secure solution \( Q = (\bigcup_{i=1}^n V_i, A_Q) \) exists such that \( A_Q = \{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \cup S\} \) where \( S \subseteq F \) and \( |S| \geq K \).

Simply, the MSI solution finds a maximal subset of the cross-links set \( F \) such that secure interoperability is ensured. The MSI solution inherently satisfies the autonomy requirement as \( A_Q = \{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \cup S\} \). However, the MSI solution has the following drawbacks:
- **NP-Completeness:** Li Gong et al. [12] showed a polynomial reduction of the Feedback Arc Set problem, which is known to be NP-complete, to the MSI problem, proving that MSI is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, it is not practical to solve the MSI problem for a large number of collaborating domains. Any practical solution would be based on heuristics, and the generated solutions would be approximate and not guaranteed to be optimal.
- **Centralized Algorithm:** The MSI problem assumes full knowledge of all domains' access control policies \( G_i = (V_i, A_i) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \), and the sets \( F \) and \( R \). To solve the MSI problem, a global view of the system is required. A trusted mediator with the global view computes the subset of \( F \) that satisfies the constraints of MSI. The mediator represents a bottleneck, making such a solution non-scalable in distributed environments with a large number of interacting parties.
- **Static Solution:** The MSI solution computed for \( n \) collaborating domains is optimal and secure for those \( n \) domains. If a domain decides to leave or join the collaboration, the MSI solution must be recomputed to ensure both optimality and security. Similarly, if a domain edits or updates its security policy, the MSI solution must be recomputed. This is impractical in dynamic environments where domains are required to join and leave the interoperation environment transparently without delays and revocations of current coalitions.
- **Fairness Issue:** The MSI solution resolves violations by removing cross-links from \( F \). However, in a violation, several domains are involved, and the removal of cross-links will affect a subset of these domains. For example, consider Figure 1, where domains A, B, and C are collaborating. Each domain has an access control hierarchy represented as a graph, and the cross-links are represented by dotted lines. A user in domain A acquiring role \( r_{A1} \) could access role \( r_{A3} \) by accessing roles \( \{r_{B3}, r_{B1}, r_{C2}, r_{C1}, r_{A3}\} \), which is a security violation as \( r_{A1} \leq r_{A3} \). Using a similar argument, a user at \( r_{B1} \) and \( r_{C1} \) could access roles \( r_{B3} \) and \( r_{C2} \), respectively. The MSI solution would remove one or more cross-links to break such a cycle. If the MSI solution removes edge \( (r_{C1}, r_{A3}) \), it eliminates the security violation but restricts users in domain C from accessing roles in domain A. This solution is not fair as it restricts access by users of domain C, whereas rights of users in other domains are not affected.

From the above discussion, we conclude that the MSI solution is NP-Complete, requires a trusted mediator, is static, and is not fair to all participating domains. In the next sections, we propose a secure technique that is computationally simple, distributed, dynamic, and ensures fairness to the participating domains.

## 3. Mediator-Free Secure Collaboration
In this section, we present the key notion of our framework: the mediator-free secure collaboration environment, which does not require a mediator with a global view to ensure secure interoperability. Figure 2 shows both types of collaboration environments. To design a mediator-free environment, we need to analyze the functions performed by the mediator, which include:
- **MSI Computation:** From the global view, the mediator computes the MSI solution, generating the optimal set of collaboration cross-links between the domains.
- **Role Querying and Routing:** Using the global view of the collaboration environment, the mediator can answer queries of the form "is \( r_2 \) reachable from \( r_1 \)?" where \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) are in different domains. The mediator can also easily determine paths between reachable roles in different domains.

![Figure 2: Collaboration Environment with and without a Mediator](figure2.png)

A mediator-free collaboration is a completely distributed form of collaboration. In this environment, the domains must collaborate in making access control decisions to avoid violations. In a mediator-free environment, none of the collaborating domains has a global view of all the access control policies; instead, the domains view the collaboration environment only through their established cross-links. Enforcing secure interoperability in such an environment is challenging as it requires domains to collaborate in both sharing resources and making access control decisions. In a mediator-free secure collaboration, the mediator functions should be executed across the collaborating domains according to a distributed strategy.

![Figure 3: Modules of the Mediator-Free Secure Interoperability Framework](figure3.png)

The following assumptions apply to a mediator-free environment:
- **Request Processing Module:** Handles the processing of access requests.
- **Path Authentication Module:** Ensures the authenticity of the received paths. This module also generates and verifies path signatures.
- **Path Discovery Module:** Includes both proactive and on-demand path discovery algorithms to enable domains to securely discover paths in the collaboration environment.
- **Basic Path Linking Rules:** Define the basic rules for linking paths.
- **Extended Path Linking Rules:** Provide additional rules for more complex path linking scenarios.

By adhering to these assumptions and modules, our framework aims to provide a robust and secure solution for mediator-free collaboration environments.
