This might be considered a duplicate of #357 but it's not exactly the same
issue.
I'd like to expose my application to the global share menu and to receive data
from other applications, not only browsers.
The OS's share menu usually allows sharing data between apps like simple
strings or even images.  
Is it planned for Flutter?
