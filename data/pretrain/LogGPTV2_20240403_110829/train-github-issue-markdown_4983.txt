As everyone knows, Electron is great in terms of easiness of designing GUIs,
but has some severe security and memory issues. The need to lock a version of
Chromium and Node.js into each app means no easy way to quickly solve security
issues (each developer has to update their own app's version manually) and it
also means a system running several Electron apps will have 150 MB in it's
memory multiplied by the number of open apps, even if they require the same
version of the framework. This could also mean more than 1 GB of memory used
for stuff as simple as desktop widgets.
A possible solution was proposed by the Electrino project, but I think it's
kind of an overkill.
What I think would be the ideal fix to all of the aforementioned, would be to
provide an installable "Electron libraries" distribution, which would ideally
also be able to receive automatic updates, and an option for developers to
release a "lite" version of their app. When the first electron-lite app is
loaded, the system starts the installed "Electron libraries", and when another
app is started, the same libraries are called. This way not only every app
weights less on storage, but also on memory, and we're sure that none of them
executes old, security-flawed versions of Node and Chromium.
Of course this won't (at least immediately) replace the default way of
installing electron apps, but developers could suggest, in their install site,
to download the lite version + the electron libraries (if the user doesn't
already have them installed), so that the amount of informed users who will
prefer the safest option will increase.
