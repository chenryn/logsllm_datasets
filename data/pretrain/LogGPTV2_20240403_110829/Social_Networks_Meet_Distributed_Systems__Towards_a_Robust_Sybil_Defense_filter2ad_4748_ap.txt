honest nodes’ degree bias γ under churn. We remind that
the unavailability for this experiment is c = 0.8, implying
only 20% of all honest nodes are online at any given instance.
Also, we note that γ = 0 suggests that the probability of an
honest node being online has no relation to its degree. As
the degree bias γ increases, the disconnection probability for
each heuristic decreases. This suggests that, when most of
the online honest nodes are high degree ones, the resultant
overlay network contains a well-connected honest region. We
note that, even for low values of γ ∈ [0.0, 0.5], the MinEC
heuristic fares as good as the Two-Hop heuristic in terms of
the network connectivity.
In terms of escape probability,
the MinEC heuristic fares as good as the One-Hop heuristic
and signiﬁcantly better than the other heuristics for a wide
range of values of the degree bias including γ = 0.
Hourly Dynamics. We now perform a trace-based evalua-
tion of the system robustness, by considering the hourly dy-
namics of YIM clients which we described in Sec. 3.2. Apart
from high unavailability (Fig. 3(a)), we recall that at least
30% of all online users in the current hour are also observed
online in the next hour, throughout the day (Fig. 3(b)). In
this experiment, we take into account such dynamics for
the values of unavailability c and the percentage of common

indicating ‘fast’ mixing times. This result suggests that ex-
isting SNSD schemes as well as potential future ones relying
on the fast mixing property of the honest region can be em-
ployed by system designers even in the face of heavy churn
by applying our MinEC heuristic.

other parameters.
Figure 12 shows the impact of the hourly dynamics on
the system robustness. In terms of disconnection probabil-
ity, the MinEC heuristic fares nearly as good as the Two-Hop
heuristic for most of the day from 6 AM till midnight, and
noticeably better than the others. The network connectivity
is worse for each heuristic in the early hours of the day, which
is due to very high unavailability c > 0.95. In terms of escape
probability, both the MinEC and Common Neighbors heuris-
tics fare as good as the One-Hop heuristic all day. Putting
both things together, the MinEC heuristic outperforms the
Common Neighbors one since the latter results in worse net-
work connectivity than that by the Random one across each
hour of the day.
6.3 Off-the-Shelf SNSD Schemes
Mixing Times. Most SNSD schemes, including the decen-
tralized [32, 31, 18, 21] and the centralized ones [13, 12],
rely on the fast mixing [22] property of the honest region’s
graph structure for their robustness. Here, we examine the
mixing times of the LCC of the online honest region created
using our proposed heuristic (MinEC) for all the datasets and
various levels of unavailability.
We compute the mixing time of a graph using the same
methodology as [23]. Speciﬁcally, given an initial distribu-
tion π(i) at node i and transition matrix P (0) which is the
adjacency matrix with normalized rows, we compute the to-
tal variation distance |π − π(i)P (w)|1 at each step (random
walk length) w where π is the stationary distribution. The
speed with which the total variation distance decays is an
indicator of the fast mixing property of the network.
Figure 13 plots the total variation distance versus the walk
length, averaged over 1000 initial distributions. The mixing
times of all graphs converge to stationary distribution in the
