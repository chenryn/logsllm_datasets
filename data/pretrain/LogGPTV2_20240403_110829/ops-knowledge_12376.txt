User:  How to use Prometheus for real-time monitoring and alarm for monitoring results?
Assistant: 1. Configure Prometheus First, you need to configure Prometheus so that it can regularly collect the indicators that need to be monitored. This can be achieved by defining various scraping targets in the Prometheus configuration file. For example: ``` scrape_configs: - job_name: "node_exporter" static_configs: - targets: ["localhost:9100"] ``` This configuration specifies that Prometheus should collect runtime metrics of the local node at regular intervals. 2. Create monitoring rules In Prometheus, you can use PromQL query statements to detect whether indicators meet certain rules. These queries can be created by defining monitoring rules. For example, the following rule can be used to monitor whether the CPU utilization exceeds 80%: ``` - alert: HighCPUUsage expr: node_cpu_seconds_total{mode='idle'} / ignoring(mode) node_cpu_seconds_total > 0.8 for: 1m ``` This monitoring rule specifies If a node's CPU utilization exceeds 80% and remains above 80% for 1 minute, the event is considered an alarm. 3. Configure alarm rules You can define alarm rules to determine when to trigger an alarm. Alerting rules can be defined based on monitoring rules and fixed thresholds. For example: ``` - name: MyAlerts rules: - alert: HighCPUUsage expr: node_cpu_seconds_total{mode='idle'} / ignoring(mode) node_cpu_seconds_total > 0.8 for: 1m labels: severity: warning annotations: summary: "High CPU usage detect ed " description: "This alert indicates that a node is experiencing high CPU usage." ``` This alert rule specifies that if a high CPU utilization event occurs, the alert will be marked as "warning" level, and a summary and describe. 4. Configure alarm notifications You can configure alarm notifications to receive notifications about alarms. Alert notifications can be received using email, Slack, or other communication methods. Just change the notification recipient in the above alert rule to the actual recipient. Through the above operations, Prometheus can be used for real-time monitoring and alarms for the monitoring results. Prometheus will issue an alert when a metric crosses a predefined threshold. This allows operators to investigate and resolve issues in a timely manner.
