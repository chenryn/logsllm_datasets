### GRL and RDL: The Rule Description Language

**Overview of GRL (Graph Rewriting Language)**
- **Data Structure**: GRL operates on directed, attributed graphs. The structure of these graphs is defined by the specific application.
- **Attributes**: Both nodes and edges in the graph can be attributed with arbitrary Java objects.
- **Basic Components**: The core building blocks of GRL are predicates (tests) and productions (rewrite rules).
- **Rewrite Rules**: These are specified textually and can perform complex attribute tests and transformations by calling Java methods from within RDL programs.
- **Execution**: RDL programs are compiled, optimized using heuristics, and then executed on a virtual machine, providing highly efficient graph matching.
- **Nondeterminism**: The rule description language RDL is nondeterministic.

**Service Matching and BPEL Generation**
- **Matching Requirements**: For services to match, both their static and dynamic interfaces must be compatible. This includes matching communication patterns.
- **Candidate Discovery**: To determine all possible service combinations, candidate services are discovered using process graph pattern matching.
- **Verification**: Combinations are checked for correctness, and invalid ones are discarded.
- **BPEL Process Generation**: For each valid combination, an executable BPEL process is generated to orchestrate the constituent services.

**Deployment of BPEL Processes**
- **Additional Files**: Besides the main BPEL file, several additional files are required for deployment:
  - **Correlation Sets**: Define subject variables to uniquely identify a process instance.
  - **Properties and PropertyAliases**: Map properties in variables to service-specific message properties, allowing for the description of equivalent properties despite different names.
  - **PartnerLinks**: Describe the interactions between pairs of services and define their roles.
  - **PartnerLinkTypes**: Map roles to port types, defining the message types exchanged during interactions.
  - **Variables**: Hold state information associated with each process instance.
  - **Correlations**: Manage asynchronous interactions by identifying the correct process instance for incoming messages.

**BPEL Generation from Interaction Diagrams**
- **Process Flow**: The main flow of the process is generated by processing elements of the PASS description according to the control flow.
- **Message Mediation**: Code is generated to translate web service requests and replies to the types of the process instance variables.
- **Supported Engines**: The generator supports ActiveBPEL and Apache ODE as output formats, with proprietary supplemental files for deployment.

### Semantic Context Modeling and Service Descriptions

**Context Handling and Context-Awareness**
- **Context Definition**: Context refers to the information captured from the environment that affects service provisioning and procurement.
- **Context-Aware Services**: These services provide relevant information and/or services based on the user's task and context.
- **Example: Service Price**: Determining a fixed price for a service is challenging due to various context dimensions. Context handling allows for dynamic pricing based on factors like user location, service agreements, usage data, and temporary discounts.

**Service Ontology**
- **Purpose**: The service ontology captures both service descriptions and context information semantically.
- **Concepts and Relations**: Based on the DOLCE foundational ontology, it provides a generic set of concepts and relations for service information.
- **Dynamic Context**: Context information dynamically emerges from various sources and is incorporated into the knowledge base (KB).

**Viewpoints and Rules**
- **Context-Based Rules**: Ontology-based rules are used to determine subparts of service descriptions, such as service price, tax rates, and discounts.
- **Viewpoints**: Different viewpoints are created for different users to provide individualized values based on context.
- **Example Rule**: A rule might associate the German tax value with business units in Germany.

### SLA Management of Composite Services

**ISE Support for Composite Services**
- **Service Composition**: ISE supports composite service providers in creating service compositions using existing services from the TEXO service marketplace.
- **SLA Regulation**: The execution of atomic and composite services is regulated by service level agreements (SLAs), which cover tasks, resources, QoS, legal aspects, and start and end times.

**Dependency Management Approach**
- **Model Creation**: A dependency model is created at design time based on the composite service process description and SLAs.
- **Lifecycle Phases**:
  - **Creation and Recomputation**: The model is created and can be extended manually with additional dependency information.
  - **Validation**: Ensures the model is valid and SLAs are correctly negotiated.
  - **Retirement**: The model is discarded when no longer needed.

**Architecture and Integration with ISE**
- **Components**: The functionality for handling dependencies is provided by three main components integrated into the ISE workbench.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Used for semi-automatic dependency analysis at design time and runtime recomputation.
- **MDH Scenario**: In the MDH scenario, different time dependencies are discovered, such as the Backup Data service needing to finish before Replace Hardware can start.

This structured and detailed approach ensures that the text is clear, coherent, and professional, making it easier for readers to understand the concepts and processes involved.
