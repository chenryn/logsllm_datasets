Hi,
ClientIP affinity seems to have some issue on Container Engine. Once you scale
down a replicas set linked to a service with session affinity and GCE external
load balancer, sticky session doesn't work anymore.  
I tried to create a new cluster to be sure it wasn't any configuration related
issue.
Steps to reproduce :
  * Create a container cluster
  * Add a replica set (with a pod running http service that show a random id defined on launch) and a service with sessionAffinity set to "ClientIP" and type "LoadBalancer"
  * scale replicaset to 0. Scale it back to 5.
  * Try to go on the url exposed on computer. Try the same thing on your phone on another network (for example your mobile data).  
The id on the phone change each time your reload the computer page.
Did i miss something ?
Thanks for your help.
