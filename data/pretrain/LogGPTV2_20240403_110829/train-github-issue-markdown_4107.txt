Hello,

I'm encountering an error in my default project after running the command `php app/console server:run`. I am using PHP 7. Here is the error message:

```
Neither the property "ip" nor one of the methods "ip()", "getip()"/"isip()" or "__call()" exist and have public access in class "Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Profiler\Profile" in @WebProfiler/Profiler/layout.html.twig at line 30.
```

Here is a screenshot for reference:

Thank you.
