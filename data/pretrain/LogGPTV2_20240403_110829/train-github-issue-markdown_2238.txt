Hello,

I am experiencing an issue with Atom Version 0.184.0 on Windows 8.1 x64. My setup includes the default keybindings, and I have disabled all community packages. Specifically, I am unable to input the "@" symbol in the editor using a German keyboard layout with the Alt-Gr + q key combination.

Thank you for your assistance.
