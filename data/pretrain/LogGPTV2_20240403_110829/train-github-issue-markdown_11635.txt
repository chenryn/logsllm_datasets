I have identified a bug in the responsive behavior of the `nav-justified` element on Google Chrome. 

When the browser window is resized to a smaller width, the menu adjusts as expected and eventually transitions into a vertical layout. However, when the window is resized back to its original, larger width, the menu does not revert to its original justified (horizontal) layout. Repeated resizing exacerbates the issue.

You can reproduce this problem by visiting the following link:
