I found a bug with the responsive behavior of the nav-justified element, on
chrome.  
When browser window is scaled down, the menu changes as it should, eventually
turning into a vertical menu. but when window is scaled back up, it doesn't go
back to the way it should be. When repeated, the problem increases.
