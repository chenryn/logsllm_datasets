### Part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)

The assumption that a component is part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) enables attackers to exploit its trust and perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against the network, as demonstrated in our attack simulations. Given the effectiveness of these attacks, we have enhanced the handoff mechanism to make the scheduler more robust. Initial results are promising, but the proposed scheme is still in a preliminary stage, and there are several important issues to address.

1. **User Rate Fluctuations**: The scheme assumes that users have statistically identical rate fluctuations, which may not always hold true in practice.
2. **Channel Statistics Estimation**: Accurate estimation of the channel statistics (G(Â·)) can be challenging without precise knowledge, making it difficult to determine the initial handoff value.

#### Security Studies on 3G Networks
Recent studies have begun to explore the security of 3G networks [9, 26, 33]. Sridharan et al. [36] modeled the uplink channel in EV-DO and suggested that malicious users could modify their power transmission levels to cause interference for honest users. In contrast, our work focuses on the downlink, given that downlink bandwidth in 3G networks is significantly higher than uplink bandwidth. We not only identify threats but also demonstrate attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities.

#### DoS Attacks on Cellular Networks
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on cellular networks have gained significant attention due to the limited resources compared to the Internet. Agarwal et al. [2] analyzed the capacity of shared control channels used for SMS delivery and concluded that increasing message volume and size can severely impact network performance. Enck et al. [13] presented a DoS attack by sending a large number of SMS messages per second to multiple cellular phones in the same area. Traynor et al. [40] evaluated this attack using a GSM simulator and proposed mitigation strategies. Mutaf and Castelluccia [28] highlighted that the paging channel is another scarce resource that can be overwhelmed to cause a DoS attack. Traynor et al. [41] noted that despite efforts to securely overlay packet-switched networks onto circuit-switched networks, mechanisms responsible for connection establishment remain vulnerable to low-bandwidth DoS attacks. Racic et al. [32] showed that attackers can deplete cellular phone batteries up to 22 times faster by exploiting MMS and data packet services. Jammers [45] can also disrupt cellular networks, though they are often ineffective on a large scale and easy to detect [15].

In contrast, our work focuses on DoS attacks originating from within the cellular network, using existing mobile devices such as cellular phones and 3G cards. These attacks are more difficult to detect because they follow wireless media access protocols.

#### Resource Sharing in Cellular Networks
Significant research has been conducted on efficient resource sharing in cellular networks, particularly on opportunistic scheduling algorithms [23, 27, 42]. Prior work has focused on improving system performance under various constraints, including TCP performance [5, 12], instability [3], and multi-cell scheduling [10]. Our study, however, considers the threat of malicious users and their impact on the Proportional Fair (PF) scheduler. While artificial handoff has been considered for load balancing [10, 35], no prior work has addressed the assignment of good initial values for handoff users.

#### Concurrent Research
Recently, Bali et al. [6] demonstrated that a long-lived network flow of a victim mobile device can be starved by a sudden arrival of packets to another offending mobile device whose buffer had been empty for a period. Their experiment, conducted on an isolated EV-DO network testbed, indirectly influenced the PF scheduler by sending bursty traffic. In contrast, our attack directly manipulates the PF scheduler by sending fake Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reports, resulting in a much greater impact. In a simulation under the same network conditions, our attack occupied more than twice as many consecutive slots in a cell with only two users and more than three times as many slots in a cell with 50 users. Additionally, since their attack exploits the fact that a user's average rate drops when the buffer is empty, it can be mitigated by limiting the decrease of average throughput when the buffer is empty [46].

### Conclusion

We have demonstrated that cellular data networks are vulnerable to DoS attacks due to the following vulnerabilities:

- **Trust in CQI Reports**: The network trusts mobile devices to report truthful CQIs, which the PF scheduler uses without verification. Malicious devices can manipulate their reported CQIs to gain a large number of time slots.
- **Lack of Throughput Tracking**: The network does not track the average throughput of mobile devices across different cells, allowing malicious devices to maintain perpetual scheduling priority through frequent handoffs.

Our simulations show that even one attacker per cell can significantly reduce the throughput and increase the delay for victim users, disrupting time-sensitive services like VoIP. Multiple attackers in the same cell can collaborate to intensify the attack. To defend against these attacks, we propose a set of detection schemes, discuss modifications to the PF scheduler, and introduce a handoff heuristic that significantly mitigates the impact of the attacks.
