part of its Trusted Computing Base (TSB). This assump-
tion enables attackers to exploit its trust and perform
DoS attacks against the network as demonstrated in our
attack simulations. In lieu of their effectiveness, we have
augmented the handoff mechanism in order to make the
scheduler more robust.
Initial results have been very
promising. Nevertheless, the proposed scheme is in a
preliminary stage. There are important issues to be ad-
dressed. The scheme applies to the case where users
have statistically identical rate ﬂuctuation, which may
not always be true in practice. In addition, the estima-
tion of G(·) can be difﬁcult without the precise knowl-
edge of channel statistics. Therefore, an important and
practical issue is to determine the handoff initial value
6 Related work
Studies on the security of 3G networks began to ap-
pear in recent years [9, 26, 33]. Sridharan et al. modeled
the uplink channel from mobile devices to the base sta-
tion in EV-DO and suggested that malicious users could
modify their power transmission levels to cause inter-
ference on honest users [36]. By contrast, our work
concentrates on the downlink given that downlink band-
width in 3G networks is considerably higher than uplink
bandwidth. Furthermore, we present not only threats but
also attacks that exploit these threats.
Denial of service (DoS) attacks on cellular networks
have attracted a lot of attention as resources on cellular
networks are much more limited than those on the Inter-
net. Agarwal et al. [2] conducted a capacity analysis of
shared control channels used for SMS delivery. They
concluded that increasing volume and message sizes
can signiﬁcantly affect network performance. Enck et
al. [13] presented a denial-of-service attack by sending
a sufﬁcient number of SMS messages per second to a
range of cellular phones in the same area. An attacker
would need only a single computer with a broadband
network access to disrupt a network in a major city by
saturating control channels shared between voice calls
and SMSs. Traynor et al.
[40] evaluated this attack
using a highly accurate GSM simulator and proposed
mitigation strategies. [28] warns that the paging chan-
nel is another scarce resource that an attacker on the In-
ternet can overwhelm to cause a DoS attack. Further-
more, Traynor et al. pointed out that in spite of numer-
ous efforts to securely overlay a packet-switched net-
work onto a circuit-switched network, mechanisms re-
sponsible for connection establishment are still vulnera-
ble to low-bandwidth DoS attacks [41]. Racic et al. [32]
showed that attackers can deplete cellular phones’ bat-
teries up to 22 times faster by exploiting Multimedia
Messaging Service (MMS) and data packet services in
the cellular network. Finally, jammers [45] can disrupt
cellular networks as well. All these studies focused on
attacks originating from outside the cellular network,
usually from the Internet. Particularly, jammers are of-
ten ineffective in causing a DoS on the cellular infras-
tructure on a large scale since each jammer covers a very
limited area. They can also be very difﬁcult to obtain
and easy to detect [15]. In contrast, our work focuses on
DoS attacks from inside the cellular network and uses
existing mobile devices, such as cellular phones and 3G
cards. Compared to jamming attacks, our attack is much
more difﬁcult to detect because it follows wireless media
access protocols.
Signiﬁcant amount of research has been conducted
on efﬁcient resource sharing in cellular networks. In par-
ticular, opportunistic scheduling algorithms have been
studied extensively [23, 27, 42]. However, prior work
focused on improving system performance under vari-
ous system constraints and requirements, including the
effect on TCP performance [5, 12], instability [3], and
multi-cell scheduling [10]. In contrast to these studies,
we consider the threat of malicious users and their im-
pact on the PF scheduler. While (artiﬁcial) handoff has
been considered for load-balancing purpose in [10, 35],
no one has studied how to assign good initial values for
handoff users, to the best of our knowledge.
Recently, concurrently with and independently of our
work, Bali et al. have showed that a long lived network
ﬂow of a victim mobile device can be starved by a sud-
den arrival of packets to another offending mobile device
whose buffer had been empty for a period of time [6].
The authors experimented on an isolated EV-DO net-
work testbed using two devices. Their exploit indirectly
inﬂuenced the PF scheduler by sending bursty trafﬁc. By
contrast, our attack directly manipulates the PF sched-
uler by sending fake CQI reports, which has much big-
ger impact.
In a simulation comparing our attack to theirs under
the same network condition, our attack occupied more
than twice as many consecutive slots in a cell with only
2 users, and more than three times as many consecu-
tive slots in a cell with 50 users.9 Moreover, since their
attack exploits the fact that a user’s average rate drops
when the user’s buffer is empty, their attack can be mit-
igated by limiting the decrease of average throughput
when the buffer is empty [46].
Finally, in addition to the vulnerability of fake CQI
reports, we also discovered a vulnerability in the hand-
off procedure that can be exploited in combination with
fake CQIs to attack the PF scheduler. Our attack, ex-
ploiting multiple attack vectors, signiﬁcantly magniﬁes
the effect of the attack and causes severe DoS to the cel-
lular network. Furthermore, we proposed a robust hand-
off algorithm that manages to mitigate the attack.
7 Conclusion
We have shown that cellular data networks are vul-
nerable to DoS attacks because of the following vulner-
abilities:
9In a cell with only two users, our attack occupied 1198 consecu-
tive slots while Bali et al.’s method occupied only 529 slots. In a cell
with 50 users, our method occupied 65 slots while theirs occupied only
20 slots.
• The network trusts mobile devices to report truth-
ful CQIs, which the PF scheduler uses without ver-
iﬁcation for assigning time slots. Therefore, mali-
cious mobile devices can manipulate their reported
CQIs to gain a large number of time slots.
• The network does not track the average throughput
of mobile devices across different cells. Therefore,
malicious devices can maintain perpetual schedul-
ing priority by frequent handoffs.
We have studied a series of attacks on the PF sched-
uler by exploiting the above vulnerabilities. Our simula-
tions show that just one attacker per cell can decrease the
throughput and increase the delay of victim users sig-
niﬁcantly, and can disrupt time-sensitive data services,
such as VoIP. Moreover, multiple attackers in the same
cell can collaborate to aggravate the attack. To defend
against the attacks, we ﬁrst propose a set of attack de-
tection schemes. Then, we discuss a variety of modi-
ﬁcations of the PF scheduler and their resilience to the
attacks. Finally, we propose a handoff heuristic that sig-
niﬁcantly mitigates the impact of the aforementioned at-
tacks.
