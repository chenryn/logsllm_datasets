Proof:  The  2-MC  loss  model  is  an  irreducible,  positive
recurrent Markov chain, and hence visits to a given state
constitute a renewal process. In our model, visits to state
1 is a (renewal) event, and hence a new cycle begins with
each  visit  to  state  1.  By  the  theory  of  renewal  reward
processes,  the  long-run  average  reward  per  unit  time  is
equal  to  the  expected  reward  earned  during  a  cycle
divided by  the  expected  time  of  a  cycle.  We  can  form  a
renewal  reward  process  by  imagining  that  a  reward  is
given at every time instant that is equal to the number of
transitions  from  that  time  onward  until  the  next  visit  to
state  1.  Then  the  expected  reward  earned  during  a  cycle
divided by the expected time of a cycle is given by

Because the long-run average reward per unit time is the
