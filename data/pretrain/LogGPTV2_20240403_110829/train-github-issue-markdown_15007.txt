Hi, I'm having an issue with `onMouseEnter` being triggered on children of a
component. _It only occurs with React 16_.
I've created a CodePen that shows the issue.
Simplified structure is as below:
                :
    –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    |                            |
    |                    |
    |                            |
    ------------------------------
    |                            |
    |        |
    |                            |
    –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
`` is a component that needs to capture `onMouseMove` events (and
trigger a `render`) and `` is a simple component that waits for an
image (passed as a `prop`) to be loaded before displaying it (using `onload`
on an `Image` created in the `constructor`).
If you open the console, you'll see that `onMouseEnter` is triggered when
hovering `` (normal behavior), but also when hovering the `.text` div
(which is not supposed to happen).
If you remove the whole `onload` logic from the `` element, then
`onMouseEnter` works as intended.
It's possible that I'm coding this in a way that isn't appropriate, but it
does look like a bug anyway :)
