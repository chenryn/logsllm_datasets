### Log Summary

The provided log chunk, spanning from 18:06:49 to 18:06:54 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - The system detected multiple address changes for the `msra-sa-41` server. Specifically, the IP and port combinations changed from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030` and from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`. These changes were logged by the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component, specifically `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, failed to renew the lease for the `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` client. The failures occurred at intervals of 111, 112, 113, 114, and 115 seconds. The system indicated that it would retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

3. **Connection Retries to RM Server**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` component attempted to connect to the Resource Manager (RM) server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. It used a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.
   - Despite the retries, the system encountered errors in contacting the RM server, as indicated by the `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM` messages.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Components**:
  - The log entries span from 18:06:49 to 18:06:54.
  - Key components involved include `RMCommunicator Allocator`, `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, and `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`.

- **Log Levels**:
  - **WARN**: Address changes and lease renewal failures.
  - **INFO**: Connection retries to the RM server.
  - **ERROR**: Failed attempts to contact the RM server.

- **Relevant Software Components**:
  - `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`
  - `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`
  - `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`

### Conclusion

The log indicates that the system is experiencing intermittent issues with address changes, lease renewals, and connectivity to the RM server. The repeated warnings and errors suggest a need for further investigation into the network configuration and the stability of the `msra-sa-41` server.
