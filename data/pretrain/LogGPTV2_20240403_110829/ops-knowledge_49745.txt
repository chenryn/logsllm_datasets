Assistant: This log chunk shows that the system is attempting to renew a lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] and is also attempting to contact the RM server at msra-sa-41:8030. The system is detecting address changes from msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030 and msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000 to msra-sa-41:8030 and msra-sa-41:9000 respectively. The system is retrying the connection to the RM server with a retry policy of RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS). However, the system is failing to renew the lease and is encountering errors in contacting the RM server.
