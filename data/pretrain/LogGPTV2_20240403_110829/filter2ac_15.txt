title:blackhat:asia-20 Back to the Future. Cross-Protocol Attacks in the Era of 5G
The state of mobile technologies can be baffling. We are already seeing deployment of 5G networks with astounding bandwidth and minimal latency. Yet, standards reliant on SS7, a technology developed in the 1970s, still continue to dominate. This mishmash of technologies, protocols, and standards in telecom has implications for security. Intruders are attacking mobile networks from all possible angles, in part by leveraging multiple protocols in combined attacks.In this presentation, I will describe how an attacker can take advantage of vulnerabilities in different generations of signaling protocols. Access to the old SS7 signaling system is enough to manipulate data on newer-generation (4G/5G) networks. Moreover, an attacker can intercept voice calls on combined 2G/3G/4G networks, as well as commit fraud by subscribing random subscribers to VAS services.All the scenarios described involve cross-protocol attacks: an attack starts with actions in one protocol that are continued by actions in a different one, requiring particular combinations of actions for the attack to succeed. The results of this research have not been published previously.
