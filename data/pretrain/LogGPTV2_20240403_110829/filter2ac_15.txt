### Title: Black Hat Asia 2020: Back to the Future - Cross-Protocol Attacks in the 5G Era

The current state of mobile technologies can be perplexing. While 5G networks, with their impressive bandwidth and minimal latency, are being deployed, older standards such as SS7, which was developed in the 1970s, still play a significant role. This mix of technologies, protocols, and standards in the telecommunications industry has profound implications for security. Attackers are exploiting mobile networks from multiple angles, often by combining vulnerabilities across different protocols.

In this presentation, I will explore how an attacker can leverage vulnerabilities in various generations of signaling protocols. For example, access to the legacy SS7 signaling system can be used to manipulate data on newer 4G and 5G networks. Additionally, an attacker can intercept voice calls on combined 2G, 3G, and 4G networks and commit fraud by subscribing unsuspecting users to Value-Added Services (VAS).

All the scenarios discussed involve cross-protocol attacks, where the initial actions in one protocol are followed by subsequent actions in a different protocol. These attacks require specific combinations of actions to succeed. The findings presented in this research have not been previously published.
