It would save a bit of hassle (especially when updating all PCs in a team) if
Typescript VS installer asked about PATH update to the latest Typescript bin
directory (ie. remove old Typescript from PATH , add new Typescript to PATH).
Managing all developers and asking them to update the PATH manually leads to
problems - incoherent versions of command line tools can lead to erratic
compilation errors between team members.
