sider that the notiﬁcation may escalate violence when read by
the abuser, and inappropriate language may re-traumatize the
survivor.
We further envision coordinated approaches to help sur-
vivors via this partnership. Instead of sporadic referrals to
domestic violence hotlines, computer security companies and
IPV professionals could work together to deploy remote se-
curity clinics [80] with digital safety planning for individual
survivors. An established partnership could increase IPV pro-
fessionals’ conﬁdence in referring their clients to computer
security companies that are committed to knowledgeably and
compassionately assisting survivors. Notably, support agents
and IPV professionals should reach a consensus about their
own responsibilities in such a collaboration — support agents
for technical issues and basic tech safety tips; IPV profes-
sionals for comprehensive safety planning and non-technical
assistance — so that survivors do not end up being referred
back and forth between these parties without getting help.
7 Conclusion
IPV is a pervasive problem that increasingly manifests in the
digital realm. Supporting IPV survivors who are experiencing
tech-enabled abuse requires the expertise of multiple stake-
holders. We discovered real-world support cases involving
IPV at a large computer security company, elicited IPV pro-
fessionals’ opinions on how customer support could assist
survivors, and explored the feasibility of implementing their
proposed suggestions with support practitioners. We identi-
ﬁed opportunities for customer support to help survivors with
care and precaution, such as by sharing tech safety resources
and making external referrals. We provide recommendations
for computer security companies to address tech-enabled IPV
through customer support, including training frontline agents
and building partnerships with IPV advocates. Based on this
research, we have started providing respective training to part-
ner companies. These ongoing early efforts underline the
promise of computer security customer support as a feasible
and necessary channel to help IPV survivors and potentially a
broader range of tech abuse victims.
