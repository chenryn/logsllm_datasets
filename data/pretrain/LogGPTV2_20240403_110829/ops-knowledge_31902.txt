User: I am developing an api on google appengine django nonrel that will serve a lot of requests. I would like to cache repeated requests.
It is estimated that there will be some really frequent queries to the api, and I would like to be able to find out what these queries are on the fly so that I may pre-cache them. Is there a way of getting the most frequent memcache keys?
Assistant: Cache everything that might be frequent, and let Memcache's LRU policy evict items that aren't accessed frequently enough to warrant remaining in the cache.
