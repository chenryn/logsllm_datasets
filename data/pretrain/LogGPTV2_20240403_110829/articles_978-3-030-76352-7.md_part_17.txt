is different from its neighborhood. In [21] for example, a saliency score is com-
puted for every observation using Fourier Transforms. In [15], an outlier score is
computed using Recurrent Autoencoder Ensembles.
Most related to our approach are anomaly detection methods using (prob-
abilistic) forecasting models. Overview of forecasting models can be found in
recent tutorials [7]. These approaches have the advantage that we can obtain an
interpretable and normalized score. Other approaches, e.g., [10,27] do not allow
for this and hence we do not consider them further. The most common forecast-
ing models are the classical ARIMA (see for example [18] for applications) and
increasingly deep learning based approaches as we apply it here [16,19]. Even
thoughinthemoregeneralareaofsequencelearning,attention-basedmodels[26]
have become the state of the art, our choice of an RNN similar to [8,23] is moti-
vated by the streaming setting that we consider here. The compact model state
ofanRNNiswellsuitedtoastreamingsetting,whereasattention-basedmodels
have a prohibitively large state. Building on extreme value theory, the authors
of [24] propose a noteworthy approach that can be seen as non-deep forecasting
based method, but where only the tail of the distribution is modeled.
Functional Time Series (FTS) models are related to our problem. In that
setting,thelearnerobservesatimesequenceoffunctionaldata,andtriestofore-
cast the next functions. This framework and the resulting methods have many
applicationsrangingfromthestudyofdemographiccurves(forexample[14])to
electricity price forecasting (see [9]). While these models allow for more general
functions than distributions as data points, the restriction to distributions has
ledtofurthermodels[4,20]andBayesianvariantshavealsobeenproposed[3,22].
Instead of time series models, it is also possible to disregard time depen-
dencies and case the time series prediction as a regression problem. This would
allowforemployingdistributionregressionmodelssuchas[25].Giventhestrong
auto-correlation in metrics data as we observe in our application, time depen-
dence should not be disregarded and we therefore do not consider this approach
further.
We can also cite the field of anomaly detection from log data ([6,17] for
example),whichalsoaimatdetectingabnormaleventsinlarge-scaledistributed
systems. The setting is however quite different from the one considered here, as
these methods are designed for unstructured data, which is not the case here as
we observe real valued time series.
6 Conclusion
We presented the first anomaly detection method based on deep distributional
time series models. The development of this model was motivated by real-world
anomalydetectiondataanduse-casesthatwecommonlyfindinmonitoringcloud
services.Intheexperiments,weshowthatonsynthetic,publicandAWS-internal
data, our method compares favorably to other anomaly detection offerings. Our
method was designed for streaming scenarios as they occur in monitoring com-
pute metrics and it is fully elastic. While labels for anomalies are sparse, imbal-
anced and noisy, they nevertheless exists. Future work should consider how to

improve the algorithms described here by incorporating labels during learning
and acquiring them during production runs to lead to a continuously improving
anomaly detection system.

Abstract. IT systems of today are becoming larger and more com-
plex, rendering their human supervision more difficult. Artificial Intel-
ligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has been proposed to tackle modern
IT administration challenges thanks to AI andBig Data. However, past
AIOps contributions are scattered, unorganized and missing a common
terminology convention, which renders their discovery and comparison
impractical. In this work, we conduct an in-depth mapping study to
collectandorganizethenumerousscatteredcontributionstoAIOpsina

classify AIOps contributions based on the choice of algorithms, data

ing interest towards AIOps, specifically to those contributions treating

1 Introduction
Modern society is increasingly dependent on large-scale IT infrastructures. At
the same time, the latest IT challenges impose higher levels of reliability and
efficiency on computer systems. Because of the large increase in size and com-
plexity of these systems, IT operators are increasingly challenged while per-
formingtediousadministration tasksmanually. Thishassparkedinrecentyears

A Systematic Mapping Study in AIOps 111
ArtificialIntelligenceforITOperations(AIOps)investigatestheuseofArti-
ficial Intelligence (AI) for the management and improvement of IT services.
AIOps relies Machine Learning, Big Data, and analytic technologies to monitor
computerinfrastructuresandprovideproactiveinsightsandrecommendationsto
reducefailures,improvemean-time-to-recovery(MTTR)andallocatecomputing
resourcesefficiently[3].AIOpsoffersawide,diversesetoftoolsforseveralappli-
cations, from efficient resource management and scheduling to complex failure
management tasks such as failure prediction, anomaly detection and remedia-
tion [13,23]. However, being a recent and cross-disciplinary field, AIOps is still
a largely unstructured research area. The existing contributions are scattered
across different conferences and apply different terminology conventions. More-
over, the high number of application areas renders the search and collection of
relevant papers difficult. Some previous systematic works only treat single tasks
or subareas inside AIOps [20,31]. This motivates the need for a complete and
updated study of AIOps contributions.
Inthispaper,wepresentin-depthanalysisofAIOpstocoverfortheselimita-
tions. We have identified and extracted over 1000 AIOps contributions through
a systematic mapping study, enabling us to delineate common trends, problems
andtools.First,weprovideanin-depthdescriptionofthemethodologyfollowed
in our mapping study (Sect.2), reporting and motivating our planning choices
regarding problem definition, search, selection and mapping. Then, we present
anddiscusstheresultsdrawnfromourstudy,includingtheidentificationofmost
common topics, data sources, and target components (Sect.3). Finally, Sect.4
summarizes the outcomes and conclusions treated in this work.
2 Methodology
2.1 Systematic Mapping Studies
Asystematicmappingstudy(SMS)isaresearchmethodologywidelyadoptedin
many research areas, including software engineering [34]. The ultimate goal of a
SMSistoprovideanoverviewofaspecificresearcharea,toobtainasetofrelated
papers and to delineate trends present inside such area. Relevant papers are
collected via predefined search and selection techniques and research trends are
identifiedusingcategorizationtechniquesacrossdifferentaspectsoftheidentified
papers,e.g.topicorcontributiontype.WechoosetoperformaSMSbecausewe
areinterestedingatheringcontributionsandobtainingstatisticalinsightsabout
AIOps, such as the distribution of works in different subareas and the presence
of temporal trends for particular topics. SMSs have also been shown to increase
the effectiveness of follow-up systematic literature reviews [34]. To this end, we
have also used our systematic mapping study to collect references for a survey
on failure management in AIOps separately published.
2.2 Planning
According to the step outline followed in [34], a systematic mapping study is
composed of:
112 P. Notaro et al.
– Formulation, i.e. express the goals intended for the study through research
questions. Equally important is to clearly define the scope of investigation;
– Search, i.e. define strategies to obtain a sufficiently high number of papers
withinthescopeofinvestigation. Thiscomprisestheselectionofoneormore
search strategies (database search, manual search, reference search, etc.);
– Selection (or screening), i.e. define and apply a set of inclusion/exclusion
criteria for identifying relevant papers inside the search result set;
– Data Extraction and Mapping, i.e. gather the information required to
map the selected papers into predefined categorization scheme(s). Finally,
results are presented in graphical form, such as histograms or bubble plots.
The next sections illustrate and motivate our choices regarding these four steps
for our systematic mapping study in AIOps.
2.3 Formulation
The main goal of this mapping study is to identify the extent of past research
in AIOps. In particular, we would like to identify a representative set of AIOps
contributions which can be grouped based on the similarity of goals, employed
data sources and target system components. We also wish to understand the
relative distribution of publications within these categories and the temporal
implications involved. Formally, we articulate the following research questions:
RQ1. What categories can be observed while classifying AIOps con-
tributions in scientific literature?
RQ2. What is the distribution of papers in such categories?
RQ3. Which temporal trends can be observed for the field of AIOps?
In terms of scope, we express the boundaries of AIOps as the union of goals
and problems in IT Operations when dealt with AI techniques. To circumvent
ambiguity about the term AI, we adopt an inclusive convention where we con-
sider AI both date-driven approaches, such as Machine Learning and data min-
ing,aswellasgoal-basedapproaches,suchasreasoning,searchandoptimization
approaches.However,wemostlyconcentrateoureffortsonthefirstcategorydue
to its stronger presence and connection to AIOps methodologies (e.g. data col-
lection).
2.4 Search and Selection
Selection Criteria. We start illustrating the selection principles beforehand,
so that the discussion will appear clearer when we describe our result collec-
tion strategy, composed of search and selection altogether. In terms of inclusion
criteria, we define only one relevance criterion, based on the main topic of the
document. Following from our discussion on scoping such inclusion criterion
comprises two necessary conditions:
