algorithm can achieve success rates from 29.41% to
39.47% at just 107 guesses, while the best success rate of
their improved PCFG-based algorithm is only 17.3% at
1010 guesses (i.e., signiﬁcantly underestimate attackers).
Third, based on more comprehensive experiments, we
outline the need for pairing passwords in terms of site
service type when comparing password strength, which
is overlooked by Li et al.’s [26, 34] and Bonneau’s [7]
work. Fourth, as shown in Sec. 3.2, two of Li et al.’s
ﬁve Chinese datasets are improperly pre-processed when
they perform data cleaning,1 which impairs their results.
1.2 Contributions
We perform a large-scale empirical analysis by lever-
aging 73.1 million passwords from six popular Chinese
sites and 33.2 million passwords from three English sites.
Particularly, we seek for fundamental properties of user-
generated passwords and systematically measure their
structural patterns, semantic characteristics and strength.
In summary, we make the following key contributions:
• An empirical analysis. By leveraging 73.1 million
real-life Chinese passwords, for the ﬁrst time, we:
(1) provide a quantitative measurement of to what
extent user passwords are inﬂuenced by their native
language; (2) systematically explore the common
semantics (e.g., date, name, place and phone #) in
passwords; and (3) show that passwords of these
two distinct user groups follow quite similar Zipf
frequency distributions, despite being created under
diversiﬁed password policies.
i.e.
• A reversal principle. We employ two state-of-the-
art password-cracking algorithms (i.e., PCFG-based
and Markov-based [36]) to measure the strength
of Chinese web passwords. We also improve the
PCFG-based algorithm to more accurately capture
passwords that are of a monotonically long structure
(e.g., “1qa2ws3ed”). At 107 guesses, our algorith-
m can crack 92% to 188% more passwords than
the best results in [34]. Particularly, we reveal
a “reversal principle”,
the bifacial-security
nature of Chinese passwords: when the guess num-
ber allowed is small, they are much weaker than
their English counterparts, yet this relationship is
reversed when the guess number is large, thereby
reconciling the contradictory claims made in [7,34].
• Some insights. We highlight some insights for
password policies, strength meters and cracking.
We provide a large-scale empirical evidence that
supports the hypothesis raised in the HCI com-
munity [17, 46]: users self-reported to rationally
choose stronger passwords for accounts associated
with a higher value, and knowingly select weaker
passwords for a lower-value service even if the
latter imposes a stricter policy. Our methodologi-
cal approaches would also be useful for analyzing
passwords of other non-English speaking users.

they have
acknowledged it. As their journal paper [26] is technically a verbatim
of their conference version [34], we mainly use [34] for discussion.

2.1 Password characteristics
Basic statistics.
In 1979, Morris and Thompson [39]
analyzed a corpus of 3,000 passwords. They reported
that 71% of the passwords are no more than 6 characters
long and 14% of the passwords are non-alphanumeric
characters. In 1990, Klein [32] collected 13,797 comput-
