## Introduction
Shodan is a search engine for Internet-connected devices. While web search engines like Google and Bing are great for finding websites, Shodan excels in finding specific types of devices and services. For example, if you need to find computers running Apache, determine the most popular version of Microsoft IIS, or identify anonymous FTP servers, traditional web search engines fall short. Shodan fills this gap by providing detailed information about Internet-connected devices and their services.

### All About the Data

#### Banner
The basic unit of data that Shodan gathers is the banner, which is textual information describing a service on a device. For web servers, this would be the headers returned, while for Telnet, it would be the login screen.

**Example of an HTTP Banner:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.1.19
Date: Sat, 03 Oct 2015 06:09:24 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 6466
Connection: keep-alive
```

**Example of a Siemens S7 Industrial Control System Protocol Banner:**
```
Copyright: Original Siemens Equipment
PLC name: S7_Turbine
Module type: CPU 313C
Unknown (129): Boot Loader A
Module: 6ES7 313-5BG04-0AB0 v.0.3
Basic Firmware: v.3.3.8
Module name: CPU 313C
Serial number of module: S Q-D9U083642013
Plant identification:
Basic Hardware: 6ES7 313-5BG04-0AB0 v.0.3
```

Banners vary greatly depending on the type of service, so it's important to specify the service when searching in Shodan.

**Note:** Shodan searches for banners, not hosts. If a single IP exposes multiple services, they will be represented as separate results.

#### Device Metadata
In addition to the banner, Shodan also collects metadata about the device, such as its geographic location, hostname, operating system, and more. Most of this metadata is searchable via the main Shodan website, but some fields are only available to users of the developer API.

#### IPv6
As of October 2015, Shodan gathers millions of banners per month for devices accessible on IPv6. These numbers are still lower compared to the hundreds of millions of banners gathered for IPv4, but they are expected to grow over the coming years.

### Data Collection

#### Frequency
Shodan crawlers operate 24/7 and update the database in real-time. At any moment, querying the Shodan website provides the latest picture of the Internet.

#### Distributed
Crawlers are distributed across various countries, including:
- USA (East and West Coast)
- China
- Iceland
- France
- Taiwan
- Vietnam
- Romania
- Czech Republic

Data is collected globally to prevent geographic bias. For instance, many system administrators in the USA block entire Chinese IP ranges. Distributing Shodan crawlers around the world ensures that any country-wide blocking does not affect data gathering.

#### Randomized
The basic algorithm for the crawlers is:
1. Generate a random IPv4 address.
2. Generate a random port to test from the list of ports that Shodan understands.
3. Check the random IPv4 address on the random port and grab a banner.
4. Repeat.

This ensures that the crawlers do not scan incremental network ranges, providing uniform coverage of the Internet and preventing bias in the data at any given time.

### SSL In Depth
SSL is becoming increasingly important for serving and consuming content on the Internet. Shodan extends the information it gathers for every SSL-capable service, including not just the SSL certificate but much more. The collected SSL information is stored in the `ssl` property on the banner (see Appendix A and Appendix E).

#### Vulnerability Testing
- **Heartbleed:** If the service is vulnerable to Heartbleed, the banner contains two additional properties: `opts.heartbleed` and `opts.vulns`.
- **FREAK:** If the service supports EXPORT ciphers, the `opts.vulns` property includes "CVE-2015-0204".
- **Logjam:** The crawlers try to connect to the SSL service using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman ciphers and store the relevant information.

#### Version
Shodan crawlers start by negotiating the SSL version and cipher with the server. They then explicitly try connecting to the server using specific SSL versions (e.g., SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2) to determine all supported versions. The gathered information is available in the `ssl.versions` field.

#### Follow the Chain
The certificate chain is the list of SSL certificates from the root to the end-user. The banner for SSL services includes a `ssl.chain` property that includes all the SSL certificates of the chain in PEM-serialized format.

### Beyond the Basics
For most services, the crawlers attempt to analyze the main banner text and parse out useful information. Here are two advanced data analysis techniques Shodan uses:

#### Web Components
The crawlers try to determine the web technologies used to create a website. For HTTP and HTTPS modules, the headers and HTML are analyzed to break down the components of the website. The resulting information is stored in the `http.components` property.

#### Cascading
If a banner returns information about peers or other IP addresses that run a service, the crawlers try to perform a banner grab on those IPs. This can cause a cascade of scans if the initial scan data contains information about other potential hosts. To track these relationships, two new properties are introduced: `_shodan.id` and `_shodan.options.referrer`.
