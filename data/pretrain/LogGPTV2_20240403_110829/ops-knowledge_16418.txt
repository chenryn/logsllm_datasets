User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Server returns a 404 code when requesting HEAD? I configured my server with Nginx (v= ), and when I try to request using HEAD, I got a 404 :

curl -I http://postera.in

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: nginx/1.2.1
Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2013 09:51:53 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1900
Connection: keep-alive


Here's my server Nginx configuration :

server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  www.postera.in;
    return       301 $scheme://postera.in$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  postera.in;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/postera_manager.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/postera_manager.error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_buffering    off;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Scheme $scheme;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:9800;
    }
}


What is wrong with this configuration ? Why a HEAD returns 404 instead of 200 ?

Thanks for the help :)

Assistant: Well, I'll answer myself on that one.

The problem is not from NGinx but from the backend, here, PlayFramework that returns a 404 when a HEAD is requested and the routes files does not contains HEAD.

A bug has been opened for that : https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/2280
