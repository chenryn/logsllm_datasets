adjacent ASes. For this purpose we use the well-tested algorithm
described by Gao in [16]. Despite the signiﬁcant follow-up work
on AS relationship inference [11, 33], we prefer Gao’s algorithm
because of its ability to infer relationships using only observed AS
paths, without any additional information such as data from routing
registries or active probes. Comparison studies for the accuracy of
related algorithms in [33] and [16] have shown that Gao’s algorithm
is more accurate in identifying peering relationships. Further, a re-
cent study [38] showed that the AS relationship inferences made
by this algorithm are quite stable with respect to variations in the
observed AS-paths. Gao’s algorithm results in four types of AS
relationships: Customer-Provider (CP), Peering (PP), Sibling, and
Unknown. We ignore the last two categories, as they account for
less than 2% of the visible links in any snapshot.
Finally, the AS topology and relationship matrix provide an an-
notated graph for each snapshot. The differences between succes-
sive snapshots show the evolutionary events of link and node births
and deaths, which form the core of the analysis in the following sec-
tions. Note that if a certain link has changed role at some snapshot
(say from CP to PP), we view that event as the death of a CP link
and the simultaneous birth of a PP link between the corresponding
ASes. The reader may be wondering about the frequency of link
type changes, from CP to PP or the opposite. Even though we can-
not answer this question in a deﬁnite manner (due to the visibility
problem with PP links), we measured that 9% of the PP links in
a snapshot become CP links in the next snapshot (This number is
the average over all pairs of snapshots). The fraction of CP links
that become PP links appears to be much less (1%) but that is prob-
ably due to the poor visibility of PP links. Also, these changes
are not cumulative, as we run the relationship inference algorithm
separately for each snapshot.
3. GROWTH AND REWIRING TRENDS
We ﬁrst examine the evolution of some major characteristics of
the global Internet.
Growth of ASes and inter-AS links: Figure 2 shows the number
of ASes and inter-AS links in each snapshot. Due to the previously
discussed issues with measuring PP links, we only count the num-
ber of CP links in each snapshot. A ﬁrst observation is that, despite
the economic recession of 2001-03 and the well documented tur-
moil in the telecom market, the Internet AS-level topology has been
increasing in size over the last ten years. Second, it appears that the
Internet has gone through two distinct growth phases so far: an ini-
tial phase, up to mid-2001, in which the Internet grew exponentially
in terms of the number of ASes and links (of the form y = a ∗ ebx).
Then, the growth process switched to linear for both the number of
ASes and links (of the form y = ax+b). We ﬁnd that the number of
ASes from 1998 to mid-2001 can be modeled as y = 3150∗e0.094x,
where x is the snapshot number (x = 0, 1, . . . ). In the last six
years, the number of ASes can be modeled as y = 2537 + 604x.
Regarding the number of CP links, the corresponding functions are
y = 5462 ∗ e0.102x and y = 1499x − 35. Each of the previous
regression formulae gives a correlation coefﬁcient that is at least
99%. To eliminate the possibility that this trend shift is an artifact
of the measurement infrastructure (e.g. the changing set of moni-
tors), we measured the number of visible ASes and CP links with
a set of monitors that remained the same in the last ten years. The
results, even though revealing a lower number of links, still show
a trajectory change from exponential to linear in mid-2001. Hus-
ton [19] observed a similar trend shift in the number of ASes (but
not CP links) around mid-2001.
To determine the boundary at which the trajectory shifted from
exponential to linear, we perform the following test. We assume
that the number of CP links and ASes can be modeled as y = a eb x
when x ≤ z and y = a x + b when x > z. We then compute the
value zmin that minimizes the total sum-of-squares error (SSE) for
the above regression formula. zmin is our estimate for the snapshot
where the growth trajectory changed from exponential to linear. It
appears that the exponential phase lasted for the ﬁrst 15 snapshots
for ASes and 16 snapshots for CP links, ending in mid/late 2001.
Figure 2 also shows the exponential and linear regression curves
for the number of ASes and CP links.
Evolution of CP link count (and lower bound estimates of PP
link count): Next, we distinguish between CP and PP links, and
examine the growth trends separately for these two link types. We
emphasize again that the number of PP links we report here should
be viewed as a lower bound on the actual number of peering links.
Figure 3 shows the number of CP and PP links, as well as their
fractions, over time. Both link types have been increasing in abso-
lute numbers. As shown earlier, the number of CP links shows an
initial exponential growth followed by a linear growth after 2001.
Modeling the growth of PP links is difﬁcult with the given measure-
ments. It appears, however, that that growth process has followed a
different trajectory than that of CP links.

Figure 3: Evolution of CP and PP links in absolute numbers
and as a fraction of the total number of links.
The bottom panel in Figure 3 shows the fraction of CP and PP
links. The fraction of PP links has been increasing steadily after
2001, even though the growth rate of CP links is larger than that of
PP links. The reason is that the relative increase rate of PP links is
larger than that of CP links. Given that we probably underestimate
the number of PP links, the fraction of PP links at the end of 2007
is at least 20%.
Evolution of AS-path length and multihoming trends: Next, we
investigate the evolution of the average AS-path length (after re-
moving AS-path prepending). We do so by calculating the average
length of the AS-paths observed in each snapshot. The upper panel
in Figure 4 shows that the average path length has remained practi-
cally constant (at 4.2 AS hops) over the last 10 years. This is inter-
esting, given the signiﬁcant growth of the underlying network. The
fact that the average AS-path length has remained constant points
to a densiﬁcation process that increases the average degree of ASes
at a sufﬁciently high rate to keep the average AS-path length con-
stant.
Indeed, the upper panel of Figure 4 shows that the aver-
age AS degree, counting only CP links, has increased consistently
over time, from 3.2 links to 4.3 links per AS. The median degree
(not shown) is dominated by small networks that have just 1 or 2
providers, and hence it does not show an increasing trend. This
densiﬁcation process has also been studied by Leskovec et al. [22],

who observed that the effective diameter 4 of the AS graph slowly
decreases with time. Earlier modeling work, such as the preferen-
tial attachment growth model of Albert and Barabasi [1], predicted
an average path length that grows slowly with the size of the net-
work (O(ln ln n)), when a newly attached node has at least two
edges. Such a growth model would result in an increase in the av-
erage path length from 4.2 to 4.7 over the last 10 years, contrary to
the constant average path length of 4.2 that we observed. An inter-
esting possibility is that ASes choose their providers in a “distance-
aware" manner, so that the AS-path length from/to their major In-
ternet sources/destinations remains practically constant with time.
A plausible explanation for the densiﬁcation of the Internet is the
increasing popularity of multihoming for economic, reliability and
performance reasons. The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows the av-
erage multihoming degree,5 deﬁned as the number of providers of
a given AS, for two broad classes of ASes: stubs (i.e., ASes that
never had customers during their observed lifetime), and non-stubs
(the rest of ASes). We ﬁnd that the average multihoming degree has
been increasing in both classes. Non-stubs, however, have been in-
creasing their average multihoming degree much faster than stubs
(from 1.5 to about 3.5), in particular after 2003. This may be be-
cause non-stubs, which are typically content/access/hosting/transit
providers, attempt to optimize their connectivity, and at the same
time improve their reliability, by multihoming to several upstream
transit providers. For many stubs, on the other hand, one or two
(primary) transit providers is often enough.
Growth versus rewiring: Next, we seek to understand the relative
signiﬁcance of growth versus rewiring. Growth refers to the addi-
tion of new ASes in the network (together with their corresponding
links), while rewiring refers to changes in the connectivity of exist-
ing ASes. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the number of CP link births
due to AS births (growth) versus CP link births due to rewiring.
We also look at the number of CP link deaths due to AS deaths
versus CP link deaths due to rewiring. The top panel of ﬁgure 5
shows, for each pair of snapshots, the number of CP link births due
to AS births and due to rewiring. Initially, the CP link births due
to AS births and rewiring were comparable in number. Since 2001,
however, we ﬁnd that the number of CP link births due to internal
4The effective diameter of a graph is the minimum value of d such
that at least 90% of the connected node-pairs are at distance at most
d. A smoothed version of this metric is used in [22].

inter-AS link.
