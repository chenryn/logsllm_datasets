**Abstract:**
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the specific destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. The pre-diabetic period in T1D is marked by the presence of beta cell-specific autoantibodies. Previous metabolomics studies have suggested that specific metabolic disturbances occur before the onset of autoimmunity. In this study, we combined lipidomics and metabolomics approaches to analyze circulating metabolites in a prospective series of plasma samples from 40 children who progressed to T1D (PT1D), 40 children who developed at least one islet autoantibody but did not progress to T1D during follow-up (P1Ab), and 40 matched controls (CTR).

Our findings indicate that sphingomyelins and methionine were persistently dysregulated in PT1D compared to P1Ab and CTR groups. Additionally, phosphatidylcholines and triacylglycerols were downregulated in PT1D compared to P1Ab, while amino acids such as glutamine and aspartic acid were downregulated in PT1D compared to CTR at the age of 3 months. Furthermore, hydroxyphenyllactic acid, indole acetic acid, and 11-eicosenoic acid, which are potential microbial metabolites, were significantly downregulated at early ages (3 and 6 months) preceding clinical T1D.

These results support previous studies and suggest novel metabolic signatures that specifically characterize children who progress to islet autoimmunity or overt T1D. These signatures may be useful for identifying at-risk children before the initiation of autoimmunity.

**Title: Baseline Metabolic Profiles of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Achieving Sustained Drug-Free Remission After Initiating Treat-to-Target TCZ, MTX, or the Combination: Insights from Systems Biology**

**Presenting Author:** Wei Yang, Leiden University, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:** Xavier Teitsma, Amy C Harms, Alireza Mashaghi, Thomas Hankemeier

**Abstract:**
For patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the treatment goal is to achieve early, rapid, and sustained remission. However, a significant number of patients respond inadequately to first-line drugs such as methotrexate (MTX) or the new biological drug tocilizumab (TCZ). Metabolic analysis prior to therapy could serve as potential indicators of disease activity and predictors of treatment response.

This study aimed to identify relevant metabolites and biological pathways associated with achieving sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after a treat-to-target strategy involving TCZ or MTX. Baseline serum samples from sDFR and non-sDFR patients with early RA were analyzed using oxidative stress, amine, and oxylipin platforms, followed by pathway analyses.

The baseline metabolic profiles of early RA were found to differ between sDFR and non-sDFR patients, with associated pathways indicating treatment-specific connections with the mechanisms of MTX or TCZ. Integrated with our previous observations analyzing relevant transcripts and proteins within the same patients, network analysis showed good correlation across "omics" data. Therefore, signature metabolite biomarkers identified in early RA could potentially act as key prognostic factors for personalized care in the future.

**Title: Analysis of Smoker’s and Non-Smoker’s Urine Using Enhanced Two-Dimensional Chromatographic Resolution and High-Performance TOFMS**

**Presenting Author:** Nick Jones, LECO Europe BV, Netherlands

**Abstract:**
Urine is a preferred biological fluid for medical testing due to its ease of collection in large quantities and its ability to provide insights into an individual's exposure, diet, and general health. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-high performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS) approach to robustly identify compounds in two urine standard reference materials (smoker’s and non-smoker’s urine).

After sample preparation and derivatization, the urine samples were analyzed using both GC-TOFMS and GCxGC-TOFMS. The transition from GC-TOFMS to high-performance GCxGC-TOFMS resulted in a significant increase in the number of confidently identified compounds, yielding cleaner spectra and improved spectral similarity scores. The Pegasus BT 4D facilitated fast and confident compound identification through enhanced two-dimensional chromatographic resolution and high-performance TOFMS. GCxGC-TOFMS contour plots were highly structured, showing clustered classes of compounds and providing high-quality spectral data, which were searched against large, well-established databases. Library hits were filtered using retention index software tools, and findings were further supported by calculating mass delta values for molecular and fragment ions. Comprehensive data were processed via non-targeted and targeted methods.

Comparison of smoker’s and non-smoker’s results demonstrated increased quantities of tobacco-related compounds, such as cotinine and trans-3’-hydroxycotinine, as well as phenols and additional nitrogen-containing compounds.

**Title: Enhanced Quantification of LPA 18:1 in Plasma with SelexION™ Ion Mobility Technology**

**Presenting Author:** Cyrus Papan, Sciex Germany GmbH, Germany

**Abstract:**
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a signaling molecule in the class of lipid mediators, functioning by signaling through G-protein coupled receptors or nuclear receptor proteins. LPA has been associated with a wide range of biological processes. The major challenge for accurate quantitation of LPA in plasma is the chemical interferences using current analytical methods. The most abundant LPA fragments, which are the best for quantification, have strong matrix interferences, while the specific qualifier fragment, the fatty acid, shows very low signal intensity.

In this study, we utilized SelexION Technology for the quantification of LPA 18:1 in plasma. This technology removes unspecific matrix interferences, allowing the use of abundant multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions for the quantitation of LPA with much greater confidence.

**Title: Metabolomics of Congenital Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Patients Treated with Recombinant Human Growth Hormone (rhGH)**

**Presenting Author:** Nilson Assunção, Unifesp, Brazil

**Co-Authors:** Luciani Renata Silveira Carvalho, Emanuel Carrilho, Vinicius Guimarães Ferreria, Paulo Cesar Gonçalves Pereira, Breno San Martin

**Abstract:**
Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is commonly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, fatigue, reduced aerobic exercise capacity, abdominal obesity, and reduced lean body mass. While these features can be reversed with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) replacement, long-term rhGH use has been reported to increase the risk of cardiac problems. This work aims to better understand the effects of rhGH replacement treatment on the metabolism of GHD patients to improve the use of such treatment.

We performed untargeted metabolomics on 46 GHD patients and 12 healthy control serum samples. Metabolites were extracted from the serum samples through a protein precipitation protocol and analyzed using direct infusion on a high-resolution mass spectrometer (LTQ-Velos Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific). The resulting spectra were aligned using an in-house-built software due to the lack of commercial software capable of handling direct infusion data. The aligned spectra were then subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) using MetaboAnalyst 4.0.

The multivariate analysis indicated a list of higher expressed metabolites in the GHD group, including glycerol, trimethylamine, citrate, pyruvate, carnitine, betaine, glucose, glycine, tyrosine, leucine, and choline. The accuracy of the ROC curve was satisfactory (AUC = 0.974). Our preliminary results suggest that the most expressive metabolites are related to the process of lipolysis and the use of lipid reserves in bioenergetic processes.

Morais, Mélanie Pétéra, Etienne Thévenot, Christophe Junot, Pierrette Gaudreau

**Abstract:**
Metabolic syndrome (MetS), defined as a cluster of cardio-metabolic factors including obesity, hypertension, dysglycemia, and dyslipidemia, is a growing public health challenge, particularly affecting older adults. In the context of personalized medicine/nutrition, new tools are necessary to provide additional knowledge about MetS etiology, better stratify populations, and customize prevention strategies.

This study aimed to investigate the integration of data from complementary untargeted metabolomics platforms (high-resolution mass spectrometry [HRMS], nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]) and technologies to characterize the MetS phenotypic spectrum. A case-control study was designed within the Quebec NuAge cohort. Six complementary untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic approaches, available within the MetaboHUB infrastructure, were performed on serum samples collected at recruitment and 3 years later. Standard operating procedures were designed to ensure inter-laboratory standardization from sample preparation to data processing. Data analyses were performed using reproducible online Galaxy workflows.

A full feature selection strategy was developed to build a comprehensive molecular MetS signature, stable over time. Consistent cross-sectional and longitudinal data were observed, reflecting subject stability regarding MetS and providing new insights into underlying mechanisms. Correlation network analysis explored the links between the molecular signature and clinical parameters. An optimized reduced signature was proposed, allowing good prediction performance (12% misclassification, AUC = 0.96, CI: [0.94-0.98]), for future clinical application. These results demonstrate the value of multidimensional molecular phenotyping as part of the next generation of medicine tools for non-communicable diseases.

**Title: Faecal Metabolomics by Conventional UHPLC-HRMS and Novel LA-REIMS Reveals Relevant Metabolic Perturbations in Type 2 Diabetes**

**Presenting Author:** Lieven Van Meulebroek, Ghent University, Belgium

**Co-Authors:** Cameron Simon, Lapauw Bruno, Takats Zoltan, Vanhaecke Lynn

**Abstract:**
Current treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have several limitations, and the disease remains incurable and difficult to manage. Diagnostic tests also have limited sensitivity and specificity, making them unsuitable for large-scale screening. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of T2D is therefore desired.

In this study, we implemented faecal metabolomics to analyze samples from individuals with normal glycaemia (n=24) and T2D (n=24). Analytical methodologies included conventional ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and innovative quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-ToF)-based laser ablation-reaction interface mass spectrometry (LA-REIMS). The latter has potential for point-of-care disease management and large-scale diagnostic screening.

Based on the faecal UHPLC-HRMS fingerprints (6,620 polar and 19,831 lipophilic components), PCA-X score plots revealed clustering according to health state, confirmed by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) modeling (p-values ≤ 1.86e-9 and Q2Y ≥ 0.654). Tentative identification of the discriminating metabolites revealed interesting chemical classes, supported by literature. LA-REIMS was successfully developed and applied for faecal analysis, using a FELS-25A IntelliguideTM CO2 laser. The LA-REIMS approach had a short total acquisition time per sample (<0.5 min). Discrimination according to health status was possible, as indicated by a valid OPLS-DA model (p-value of 6.65e-17 and Q2Y of 0.767).

In conclusion, faecal metabolomics using conventional UHPLC-HRMS and novel LA-REIMS was successfully applied to characterize T2D for the first time.

**Title: Lipidomic Signatures of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease**

**Presenting Author:** Aidan McGlinchey, Örebro University, Sweden

**Co-Authors:** Cecilia Carlsson, Quentin Anstee, Tuulia Hyötyläinen, Matej Orešič

**Abstract:**
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a major risk factor for chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes, currently lacks non-invasive diagnostic techniques for stages such as steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis. We previously identified specific serum lipid signatures associated with total liver fat and NASH. In this study, we investigated lipidomic profiles in the European project Elucidating Pathways of Steatohepatitis (EPoS) cohort (n=688), comprising various stages of NAFLD (n=666), NASH (n=661), and fibrosis (n=511).

In line with previous studies, we found that steatosis grade strongly associates with certain low-carbon-number, low-double-bond-count triglycerides increasing and specific phospholipids decreasing. As NAFLD progresses from an earlier steatosis state to a later, severe fibrotic stage, fibrosis grades are used as clinical markers of progression to and severity of NASH. Preliminary analysis of 511 subjects with different grades of fibrosis versus those without, revealed distinct relationships between circulating lipids and fibrosis stage, with the profile changing appreciably between steatosis and fibrosis.

We suggest that dysregulation of lipid metabolism across stages of NAFLD is reflected in circulation and may hold diagnostic value and insight into NAFLD pathogenesis. Further analysis of these markers is warranted and currently being undertaken to enhance their diagnostic utility.

**Title: Identification of Metabolite Biomarkers of Incident Chronic Kidney Disease in Pre- and Type 2 Diabetes Patients**

**Presenting Author:** Jialing Huang, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Germany

**Co-Authors:** Cornelia Huth, Martina Troll, Barbara Thorand, Christian Gieger, Jerzy Adamski, Annette Peters, Rui Wang-Sattler

**Abstract:**
Background and Objective: Hyperglycemia exerts detrimental effects on the kidney and is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to identify candidate metabolite biomarkers of CKD in hyperglycemic patients and evaluate their involvement in the pathogenesis of CKD.

Methods and Results: We used a targeted metabolomics approach to examine the longitudinal association of baseline concentrations of 125 metabolites with CKD incidence over 7 years in the KORA (Cooperation Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort. We found that 19 metabolites were nominally associated (P < 0.05) with incident CKD in 397 hyperglycemic participants, adjusting for known CKD risk factors (e.g., age, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, serum triglycerides, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and baseline albumin-to-creatinine ratio). Three metabolites were selected as candidate biomarkers via Priority-Lasso and backward stepwise selection, and they were also false discovery rate (FDR) significant among the 125 metabolites in both models. Higher levels of these three metabolites were found to increase the risk of incident CKD in hyperglycemia. Moreover, these three metabolites significantly improved the predictive value of the clinical predictors, as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value increased from 0.854 to 0.887 (P = 0.037).

Conclusion: We identified three novel metabolites as predictors for CKD incidence in hyperglycemia, which may help develop new strategies to prevent CKD in hyperglycemic patients. Our results need to be replicated in an independent study.

**Title: Plasma Phospholipid Profile May Reflect Beneficial Effect of Physical Activity on Psychological Stress**

**Presenting Author:** Stefania Noerman, University of Eastern Finland, Finland

**Co-Authors:** Elina Järvelä-Reijonen, Anton Mattsson, Urho Kujala, Sampsa Puttonen, Riitta Korpela, Marjukka Kolehmainen, Kati Hanhineva

**Abstract:**
Psychological stress is known to increase the risk factors for metabolic diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we present the application of non-targeted metabolite profiling to reveal a panel of metabolites that may potentially mediate the cross-talk between psychological and physiological health.

Subjects prone to metabolic syndrome and psychological distress were recruited from three different cities in Finland and randomized to different 8-week lifestyle interventions. Metabolic profiling was performed on plasma samples from 64 controls and 60 subjects from the face-to-face intervention group, who showed the largest improvement in stress levels between baseline (week 0) and follow-up (week 36). Non-targeted metabolite profiling was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).

Physical activity was associated with recovery and negatively associated with stress and adiposity. Several phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC) (18:1/22:6) and two unknown PCs (817.596@12.58 and 839.603@12.72), were elevated in the intervention group and associated with recovery and peak oxygen consumption (VO2max). They were also negatively associated with adiposity, stress index, and inflammation marker interleukin-1-receptor antagonist. Conversely, some other PCs, which were suppressed in the intervention group, including PC (16:0/16:1), (16:1/18:2), and (18:0/20:3), correlated positively with adiposity and negatively with sleep, recovery, and VO2max.

The beneficial effect of physical activity on improving stress and body composition may be related to changes in the plasma profile of phospholipids, especially those from the PC class. Trial registration: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on August 17, 2012, with identifier NCT01738256.

**Title: The PXR-Gut Microbiota Cross Talk Controls the Host Hepatic Lipid Metabolism in a Sexually Dimorphic Way**

**Presenting Author:** Sharon Barretto, INRA-Toxalim, France

**Co-Authors:** Frederic Lasserre, Lorraine Smith, Celine Lucowikz, Arnaud Polizzi, Colette Bétoulières, Laurence Guzylack, Sandrine Menard, Elodie Person, Sandrine Bruel, Daniel Zalko, Cecile Canlet, Lindsay Peyriga, Edern Cahoreau, Laila Mselli-Lakhal, Nicolas Loiseau, Laurence Gamet-Payrastre, Hervé Guillou, Sandrine Ellero-Simatos

**Abstract:**
The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a xenobiotic nuclear receptor, mainly expressed in the liver and intestine. In germ-free mice, hepatic PXR activity is significantly reduced, suggesting PXR activation by gut microbiota-derived metabolites. However, the interaction between PXR and the gut microbiota remains unclear.

We investigated this bi-directional interaction by examining the effects of gut microbiota suppression by antibiotics, integrating transcriptomics (liver, ileum), 1H-NMR-based metabolomics (liver, caecal content), lipidomics (liver), and 16S sequencing (caecal content) in Pxr+/+ and Pxr-/- male and female C57Bl6/J littermates. Microbiota suppression significantly decreased PXR activity in the liver and ileum of males, while only in the liver of females. Antibiotics significantly affected the hepatic 1H-NMR aqueous metabolic profiles of both Pxr+/+ and Pxr-/- mice. Antibiotics also decreased hepatic triglycerides, relative abundance of hepatic C16 and C16:1n-7 fatty acids, and increased C20:1n-9 fatty acid profile in Pxr+/+ males compared to the control group. Similarly, mRNA levels of elongases (Elovl2, 3, and 5) were decreased in antibiotic-treated Pxr+/+ males only.

Reciprocally, PXR deletion significantly affected gut microbiota composition, with an increased proportion of Tenericutes in the caecal content of Pxr-/- compared to Pxr+/+ males. Metabolic profiles of caecal content were also significantly different, with a tyrosine-derived gut microbiota metabolite significantly higher in Pxr-/- compared to Pxr+/+ males. No gut microbiota differences were observed in females.

In conclusion, gut microbiota activates PXR in the liver and ileum of male mice. This crosstalk induces distinct changes in hepatic lipid composition, influencing hepatic metabolism and gut microbiota, specific to males only.

**Title: Integrated Analysis of Bile Acid Metabolome and Microbiome for High-Fat-Diet Effects**

**Presenting Author:** Huiru Tang, School of Life Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, China

**Co-Authors:** Hong Lin, Yanpeng An, Yulan Wang

**Abstract:**
Obesity is a global health issue, and the mechanistic aspects of obesity development remain to be fully understood. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the roles of bile acids and their associations with gut microbiota during obesity development using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity rat model.

We developed an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method for bile acid quantification and analyzed bile acid fluxes in multiple biological matrices, including feces, plasma, liver tissue, and various segments of intestinal tissues. We found that, irrespective of dietary regimes, taurine-conjugated bile acids were the dominant species in the liver, whereas unconjugated bile acids were in plasma. However, HFD caused slight increases in the total bile acid pool, particularly in the levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA) (138.67 ± 37.225 nmol/L in controls, 242.61 ± 43.16 nmol/L in HFD group, p = 0.014) and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) (2.8 ± 0.247 nmol/g in controls, 4.5 ± 0.386 nmol/g in HFD group, p = 0.0018) in plasma and liver tissues, respectively. These changes were consistent with the increased levels of DCA in intestinal tissues and feces.

These changes were correlated with an increase in the abundance of genera Blautia, Coprococcus, Intestinimonas, Lactococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus. Our investigation revealed the fluxes of bile acids and their association with gut microbiota during obesity development and explicated the unfavorable impact of HFD on health.

**Presenting Author:** Beatriz Galindo-Prieto, Inst. for Computational Biomedicine, EIPM, Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, United States

**Co-Author:** Jan Krumsiek

**Abstract:**
Asthma, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect millions of people worldwide. Multivariate and multiblock statistical models are widely used to find relationships and patterns that can help better understand the underlying biology and move towards finding a cure. Multi-omics data integration involves analyzing multiple -omics data matrices simultaneously using multiblock approaches that find correlations among the blocks (i.e., data matrices) and relationships between descriptors (e.g., metabolites) and responses (e.g., clinical outcomes).

Three examples are provided here:
1. A study carried out at NTNU (Norway) where multivariate methods, such as principal component regression of eye and hand motion tracking data, helped better understand language processing in children with ASD (Vulchanova et al., manuscript in revision, 2019).
2. A study from UMU and Karolinska Institute (Sweden) on the biological interactions in asthma using the MB-VIOP variable selection method (Galindo-Prieto, 2017) after modeling a 6-block multi-omics dataset (Reinke et al., 2018).
3. A currently ongoing study (Arnold et al., bioRxiv, 2019) from Weill Cornell Medicine (USA) aiming to find correlations between blood and brain in a 4-block multi-omics Alzheimer’s dataset.

**Title: New Biomarkers of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl CoA Lyase Deficiency**

**Presenting Author:** Štěpán Kouřil, University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic

**Co-Authors:** Jan Václavík, Lucie Mádrová, Radana Karlíková, David Friedecký, Leo AJ Kluijtmans, Ron A Wevers, Tomáš Adam

**Abstract:**
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase deficiency (HMGCLD) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the HMGCL gene. The mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of HMG-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetic acid. Diagnosis is established by tandem MS-based newborn selective metabolic screening, which includes a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transition for C5-OH carnitine (262 → 85), representing four different compounds (Me-malonylcarnitine, 3-OH-isovalerylcarnitine, succinylcarnitine, and 2-Me-3-OH-butyrylcarnitine), pointing to different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). To distinguish between these IEMs, organic acid profiles of urine samples must be acquired.

We performed untargeted metabolomic analysis of five plasma samples from HMGCLD patients and a group of controls to find new diagnostic biomarkers detectable even via newborn screening. Apart from known biomarkers such as 3-OH-isovalerylcarnitine and 3-Me-glutarylcarnitine, other acylcarnitine (AC) species derived from intermediates in the leucine degradation pathway were observed. Organic acid counterparts of these ACs were also significantly increased compared to controls. Newly found elevated ACs could hypothetically be expected in another condition, 3-Me-glutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency (MGCA). HMGCLD could be distinguished from MGCA by measuring 3-OH-3-Me-glutarylcarnitine or 3-OH-3-Me-glutarate.

The results suggest that 3-OH-3-Me-glutarylcarnitine and 3-OH-3-Me-glutarate could be specific biomarkers of HMGCLD in dried blood spots by flow injection analysis-mass spectrometry (FIA-MS) screening, thus speeding up differential diagnoses among all the diseases screened by the C5-OH transition. This would allow for earlier introduction of dietary intervention directly from the first screening sample.
