Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by specific destruction of the insulin-producing beta cell Clinically pre-diabetic 
period in T1D is characterized by presence of beta cell specific autoantibodies Intriguingly, earlier metabolomics study suggests specific metabolic 
disturbances before individuals precede to auto-immunity Here we combine lipidomics and metabolomics approach to analyze circulating 
metabolites in a prospective series of plasma samples from 40 children who progressed to T1D (PT1D), 40 children who developed at least a single 
islet autoantibody but did not progress to T1D during the follow-up (P1Ab) and 40 matched controls (CTR) We found sphingomyelins and methionine 
to be persistently dysregulated in PT1D when compared to the P1Ab and CTR groups Additionally, phosphatidylcholines and triacylglycerols were 
downregulated in PT1D as compared to P1Ab, while amino acids including glutamine, aspartic acid were downregulated in PT1D as compared to 
CTR at the age of 3 months Furthermore, we found hydroxyphenyllactic acid, indole acetic acid, and 11-eicosenoic acid, metabolites of potential 
microbial origin, to be significantly downregulated at early age (3 and 6 months) preceding clinical T1D Our study support findings from earlier 
studies and suggests novel metabolic signatures that specifically characterize children who progressed to islet autoimmunity or overt T1D, 
respectively, which may be helpful in the identification of at-risk children before the initiation of autoimmunity

Baseline metabolic profiles of early rheumatoid arthritis patients achieving sustained drug-free remission after initiating  
treat-to-target TCZ,MTX or the combination:insights from systems biology
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Wei Yang, Leiden University, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Xavier Teitsma, Amy C Harms, Alireza Mashaghi, Thomas Hankemeier
For patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA), treatment aim is early, rapid, and sustained remission However, still a significant 
number of patients respond insufficiently to first-line drug methotrexate (MTX) or new biological drug tocilizumab (TCZ) Metabolic analysis prior 
to therapy could be potential indicators of disease activity and predictors of treatment response The aim of this study was to identify relevant 
metabolites and biological pathways associated with achieving sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after a treat-to-target TCZ- or MTX-based 
strategy Baseline serum samples were analyzed from sDFR and non-sDFR patients of early RA Metabolomic measurements were performed on 
oxidative stress, amine and oxylipin platforms followed by pathway analyses in each arm In a result, baseline metabolic profiles of early RA were 
found to be different between sDFR and non-sDFR and associated pathways can indicate treatment-specific connections with drug mechanisms 
of MTX or TCZ Integrated with our previous observations analyzing relevant transcripts and proteins within the same patients, network analysis 
showed good correlation across “omics” data Therefore, signature metabolite biomarkers identified in early RA could potentially act as key 
prognostic factors for applying personalized care in the future

Analysis of Smoker’s and Non-Smoker’s Urine using enhanced two-dimensional chromatographic resolution and high 
performance TOFMS
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Nick Jones, LECO Europe BV, Netherlands
Urine is a favored biological fluid for medical testing, since it is easy to obtain in large quantities and provides a window into an individual’s 
exposure, diet, and general health In this study, a novel analytical approach based on comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-
high performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry was utilized for robust identification of compounds in two urine standard reference materials 
(smoker’s and non-smoker’s urine) After sample preparation and derivatization, the urine samples were analyzed using both GC-TOFMS and 
GCxGC-TOFMS An increase of confidently identified compounds in urine standards was the direct result of transitioning from GC-TOFMS to high 
performance GCxGC-TOFMS, which yields cleaner spectra and thus improved spectral similarity scoresThe Pegasus BT 4D facilitated fast and 
confident compound identification through enhanced two-dimensional chromatographic resolution and high performance TOFMS GCxGC-TOFMS 
contour plots were highly structured, showing clustered classes of compounds and provided high quality spectral data, that were searched against 
large, well-established databases Library hits were filtered using retention index software tools and findings further supported by calculating mass 
delta values for molecular and fragment ions Comprehensive data was processed via non-targeted and targeted methods Comparison of smoker’s 
and non-smoker’s results demonstrated increased quantities of tobacco related compounds, such as cotinine and trans-3’-hydroxycotinine, but also 
phenols, and additional nitrogen-containing compounds

Enhanced Quantification of LPA 18:1 in Plasma with SelexION™ Ion Mobility Technology
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Cyrus Papan, Sciex Germany GmbH, Germany
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a signaling molecule in the class of lipid mediators, functioning by signaling through G-Protein coupled receptors or 
nuclear receptor proteins LPA has been associated with a wide range of biological processes The major bottleneck for accurate quantitation of LPA 
in plasma is the chemical interferences, using current analytical methods The most abundant LPA fragments, the best fragments for quantification 
has strong matrix interferences, while the specific qualifier fragment, the fatty acid, shows very low signal intensity Here we utilize SelexION 
Technology for the quantification of LPA 18:1 in plasma which removes the unspecific matrix interferences in plasma sample, allowing to use the 
abundant MRM transitions for quantitation of LPA with much greater confidence

Diagnosis of GHD is commonly associated with the increase on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in the patients, that frequently suffers from 
fatigue, reduced aerobic exercise capacity, abdominal obesity and reduced lean body mass A variety of these features could be reversed by the 
use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) replacement, however, the use of rhGH for long periods was previously reported to increase the 
risks of the patients to suffer cardiac problems This work aims to better understand the effects of rhGH replacement treatment in the metabolism 
of the patients, in order to brighten the use of such treatment Therein, we performed untargeted metabolomics on 46 GHD patients and 12 health 
controls serum samples The metabolites were extracted from the serum samples through a protein precipitation protocol, and followed to direct 
infusion analysis on a high-resolution mass spectrometer (LTQ-Velos Orbitrap, Thermo-scientific) The resulting spectras were first aligned, using 
the m/z’s, by an in-house build software, due the lack of commercial softwares able to handle with direct infusion data The aligned spectras 
were then submitted to PCA and PLS-DA analysis using the MetaboAnalyst 40 tool The multivariate analysis indicated a list of higher expressed 
metababolites in the GDH group, such as glycerol, trimethylamine, citrate, pyruvate, carnitine, betaine, glucose, glycine, tyrosine, leucine, choline 
The accuracy of ROC Curve was satisfactory (AUC=0974) Our preliminary result showed that the most expressive metabolites are related to the 
process of Lipolysis and the use of lipid reserves in bioenergetic processes

Metabolic syndrome (MetS), defined as a cluster of cardio-metabolic factors including obesity, hypertension, dysglycemia, and dyslipidemia, 
and mostly affecting older adults, is now a public health challenge because of its growing prevalence In the context of personalized medicine/
nutrition, new tools are necessary to bring additional knowledge about MetS etiology, better stratify populations and customise strategies for 
prevention The objective of this study was to investigate the integration of data from complementary untargeted metabolomics platforms (HRMS, 
RMN) and technologies to characterize the MetS phenotypic spectrum A case-control study was designed within the Quebec NuAge cohort1 
Six complementary untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic approaches, available within the MetaboHUB infrastructure2, were performed on serum 
samples collected at recruitment and 3 years later Standard operating procedures were designed to guaranty the inter-laboratory standardisation 
from sample preparation to data processing Data analyses were performed using reproducible online Galaxy workflows3 A full feature selection 
strategy was developed to build a comprehensive molecular MetS signature, stable over time Consistent cross-sectional and longitudinal data were 
observed with a wide range of metabolites (lipids, carbohydrates, amino-acids, peptides…) reflecting subject stability regarding MetS, and providing 
new insights about underlying mechanisms Correlation network analysis contributed to explore the links between the molecular signature and 
clinical parameters Additionally, an optimized reduced signature was proposed, allowing good prediction performances (12% misclassification, 
AUC=096, CI:[094-098]), for future clinical application These results demonstrated the interest of a multidimensional molecular phenotyping as 
part of the next generation of medicine tools in the frame of non-communicable diseases

Faecal metabolomics by conventional UHPLC-HRMS as well as novel LA-REIMS reveals relevant metabolic perturbations in 
type 2 diabetes
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lieven Van Meulebroek, Ghent University, Belgium
CO-AUTHORS: Cameron Simon, Lapauw Bruno, Takats Zoltan, Vanhaecke Lynn
Currently, treatments of type 2 diabetes hold some essential shortcomings, which concurs with the fact that this disease is still not curable nor 
a steady-state can be achieved In addition, diagnostic tests have limited sensitivity and specificity, and are not ideal for large-scale screening 
A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of type 2 diabetes is therefore desired For this purpose, our study implemented faecal 
metabolomics whereby faecal samples were collected from individuals with normal glycaemia (n=24) and type 2 diabetes (n=24) (UZ Ghent 
EC/2016/0673, HbA1c-based classification) Analytical methodologies employed conventional UHPLC-Q-ExactiveTM-MS as well as innovative 
Q-ToF-based LA-REIMS, with the latter having potential for point-of-care disease management and large-scale diagnostic screening Based on 
the faecal UHPLC-HRMS fingerprints (6620 polar and 19831 lipophilic components), PCA-X score plots revealed clustering according to health 
state, which was confirmed by OPLS-DA modelling (p-values ≤ 186e-9 and Q2Y ≥ 0654) Tentative identification of the discriminating metabolites 
revealed some interesting chemical classes, for which a role in type 2 diabetes was substantiated by literature LA-REIMS was successfully 
developed and applied for faecal analysis, thereby using a FELS-25A IntelliguideTM CO2 laser A major asset of the LA-REIMS approach concerned 
the short total acquisition time per sample, being < 05 min Using this high-throughput approach, discrimination according to health status was 
possible, as indicated by the valid OPLS-DA model (p-value of 665e-17 and Q2Y of 0767) In conclusion, for the first time, faecal metabolomics was 
successfully applied to characterize type 2 diabetes, using conventional UHPLC-HRMS and novel LA-REIMS

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Aidan McGlinchey, Örebro University, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Cecilia Carlsson, Quentin Anstee, Tuulia Hyötyläinen, Matej Orešič
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a major risk factor for chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes, has no non-invasive diagnostic techniques 
currently available for stages such as steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis We previously identified specific serum lipid 
signatures associating (1) with total liver fat1 and (2) NASH2 Here, we investigated lipidomic profiles of the European project Elucidating Pathways 
of Steatohepatitis (EPoS) cohort (n=688), comprising various stages of NAFLD (n=666), NASH (n=661) and fibrosis (n=511) In line with previous 
studies1, we show that steatosis grade strongly associates with (1) certain low-carbon-number, low-double-bond-count triglycerides increasing and 
(2) specific phospholipids decreasing As NAFLD progresses from an earlier steatosis state to a later, severe fibrotic stage, fibrosis grades are used 
as clinical markers of progression to and severity of NASH Preliminary analysis of 511 subjects with grades of fibrosis versus those without, revealed 
distinct relationships existing between circulating lipids and fibrosis stage, the profile changing appreciably between steatosis and fibrosis We 
therefore suggest dysregulation of lipid metabolism across stages of NAFLD are reflected in circulation and may hold diagnostic value and insight 
into NAFLD pathogenesis Further analysis of these markers is warranted and currently being undertaken taking these preliminary findings further 
toward diagnostic utility

Background and objective Hyperglycemia exerts detrimental effects on the kidney and is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) Identification of candidate metabolite biomarkers of CKD in hyperglycemic patients and evaluated their involvement in the pathogenesis of 
CKD are the aims of this study Methods and Results We used targeted metabolomics approach and examined longitudinal association of baseline 
concentrations of 125 metabolites with CKD incidence over 7 years in the KORA (Cooperation Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort 
We found that 19 metabolites nominally associated (P < 005) with incident CKD in 397 hyperglycemic participants in two multivariate logistic 
regression models by adjusting the effect of known CKD risk factors (eg age, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, serum triglycerides, baseline 
estimated glomerular filtration rate and baseline albumin-to-creatinine ratio) Furthermore, three metabolites were selected as candidate biomarkers 
via Priority-Lasso and a backward stepwise selection, and they were also FDR significant among 125 metabolites in both models Higher levels of 
these three metabolites were found to increase the risk of incident CKD in hyperglycemia Moreover, these three metabolites significantly improved 
the predictive value of the clinical predictors as the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) value increased from 0854 to 
0887(P = 0037) Conclusion We identified three novel metabolites to be predictors for CKD incidence in hyperglycemia, which may help develop 
new strategies to prevent CKD in hyperglycemic patients Our results need to be replicated in an independent study

Psychological stress seems to increase risk factors of metabolic diseases, but the underlying mechanisms have not been completely understood 
Here we present the application of non-targeted metabolite profiling to reveal a panel of metabolites that may potentially intermediates of cross-
talk between psychological and physiological health Subjects prone to metabolic syndrome and psychological distress were recruited from three 
different cities in Finland and randomised to different 8-week lifestyle interventions Metabolic profiling was performed on plasma samples of 64 
controls and 60 subjects from face-to-face intervention group who showed the largest improvement of stress level between baseline (week 0) 
and follow-up (week 36) Non-targeted metabolite profiling was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem 
mass spectrometry analysis Physical activity seems to be associated with recovery and negatively associated with stress and adiposity Several 
phospholipids that were elevated in the intervention group, including phosphatidylcholine (PC) (18:1/22:6), and two unknown PC (817596@1258 and 
839603@1272) were associated with recovery and peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) and negatively associated with adiposity, stress index, 
and inflammation marker interleukin-1-receptor antagonist Conversely, some other PC that were suppressed in intervention group including PC 
(16:0/16:1), (16:1/18:2), and (18:0/20:3), correlated positively with adiposity and negatively with sleep, recovery, and VO2max The beneficial effect of 
physical activity on improvement of stress and body composition hence may be related to changes in the plasma profile of phospholipid, especially 
ones from PC class Trial registration: The study was registered at ClinicalTrialsgov on August 17, 2012 with identifier NCT01738256

The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a xenobiotic nuclear receptor, mainly expressed in liver and intestine In germ-free mice, hepatic PXR activity 
is significantly reduced, suggesting PXR activation by gut microbiota-derived metabolites However, its interaction with the gut microbiota 
remains unclear We investigated this bi-directional interaction by looking into the effects of gut microbiota suppression by antibiotics integrating 
transcriptomics (liver, ileum), 1H-NMR based metabolomics (liver, caecal content), lipidomics (liver) and 16S sequencing (caecal content) in Pxr+/+ and 
Pxr-/- male and female C57Bl6/J littermates Microbiota suppression significantly decreased Pxr activity in the liver and ileum of males while only 
in the liver of females Antibiotics significantly affected the hepatic 1H-NMR aqueous metabolic profiles of both Pxr+/+ and Pxr-/- mice Antibiotics 
also decreased hepatic triglycerides, relative abundance of hepatic C16 and C16:1n-7 fatty acids and increased C20:1n-9 fatty acid profile of Pxr+/+ 
males compared to its control group Similarly, mRNA levels of elongases (Elovl2, 3 and 5) were decreased in antibiotic-treated Pxr+/+ males only 
Reciprocically, PXR deletion significantly affected gut microbiota composition, with increased proportion of Tenericutes in caecal content of Pxr-/- 
compared to Pxr+/+ males Metabolic profiles of caecal content were also significantly different, with a tyrosine-derived gut microbiota metabolite 
significanlty higher in Pxr-/- compared to Pxr+/+ males No gut microbiota difference was observed in females In conclusion, gut microbiota activates 
Pxr both in liver and in ileum of male mice This crosstalk induces distinct changes in hepatic lipid composition influencing hepatic metabolism and 
gut microbiota, specific to males only

Intergrated analysis of bile acid metabolome and micriobiome for High-fat-diet effects
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Huiru Tang, School of Life Sciences, Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, China
CO-AUTHORS: Hong Lin, Yanpeng An, Yulan Wang
Obesity has become a worldwide health issue though mechanistic aspects of obesity development remain to be fully understood Here, we aim to 
elucidate the roles of bile acids and their associations with gut microbiota during obesity development with a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity 
rat model We developed an UHPLC-MS method for bile acids quantification and analysed bile acids fluxes in multiple biological matrixes including 
feces, plasma, liver tissue and various segments of intestinal tissues We found that, irrespective of dietary regimes, taurine-conjugated bile acids 
were the dominant species in the liver whereas unconjugated bile acids were in plasma However, HFD caused slight increases in the total bile acids 
pool and particularly the increases in the levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA) (13867 ± 37225 nmol/L in controls, 24261 ± 4316 nmol/L in HFD group, p 
= 0014) and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) (28 ± 0247 nmol/g in controls, 45 ± 0386 nmol/g in HFD group, p =00018) in plasma and liver tissues, 
respectively, which were consistent with the increased levels of DCA in intestinal tissues and feces These changes are correlated to an increase in 
abundance of genera Blautia, Coprococcus, Intestinimonas, Lactococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus Our investigation revealed the fluxes of 
bile acids and their association with gut microbiota during obesity development and explicated unfavorable impact of HFD on health

Asthma, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect millions of people worldwide Multivariate and multiblock statistical 
models are widely used for finding relationships and patterns that can help to better understand the underlying biology, and thus move forward 
to try to reach a cure Multi-omics data integration entails analyzing multiple -omics data matrices simultaneously by using multiblock approaches 
that find correlations among the blocks (ie, data matrices) and relationships between descriptors (eg, metabolites) and responses (eg, clinical 
outcomes) Three examples are provided here: (i) A study carried out at NTNU (Norway) where is shown how multivariate methods such as principal 
component regression of eye and hand motion tracking data can help to better understand language processing in children with ASD (Vulchanova 
et al, manuscript in revision, 2019), (ii) a study from UMU and Karolinska Institute (Sweden) of the biological interactions in asthma using the MB-
VIOP variable selection method (Galindo-Prieto, 2017) after modeling a 6-block multi-omics dataset (Reinke et al, 2018), and (iii) a currently ongoing 
study (Arnold et al, bioRxiv, 2019) from Weill Cornell Medicine (USA) with the goal to find correlations between blood and brain in a 4-block multi-

3-OH-3-Me-glutaryl-coenzyme A lyase deficiency (HMGCLD) is a rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations in HMGCL gene The 
mitochondrial enzyme is responsible for catalysing the cleavage of HMG-CoA to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetic acid Diagnosis is established by 
tandem MS based newborn selective metabolic screening that contains SRM transition for C5-OH carnitine (262 → 85) which represents four 
different compounds (Me-malonylcarnitine, 3-OH-isovalerylcarnitine, succinylcarnitine and 2-Me-3-OH-butyrylcarnitine) pointing to different inborn 
errors of metabolism (IEM) In order to distinguish between these IEM organic acid profiles of urine samples must be acquired We run untargeted 
metabolomic analysis of five plasma samples from HMGCLD patients together with a group of controls with the aim to find new diagnostic 
biomarkers that would be detectable even via newborn screening Apart from known biomarkers such as 3-OH-isovalerylcarnitine and 3-Me-
glutarylcarnitine, other acylcarnitine (AC) species derived from intermediates in the leucine degradation pathway were observed Furthermore, 
organic acid counterparts of these AC were also significantly increased compared to controls Newly found elevated AC could hypothetically be also 
expected in one other condition, 3-Me-glutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency (MGCA) HMGCLD could be distinguished from MGCA by measuring 
of 3-OH-3-Me-glutarylcarnitine or 3-OH-3-Me-glutarate The result suggests that 3-OH-3-Me-glutarylcarnitine and 3-OH-3-Me-glutarate could 
be specific biomarkers of HMGCLD in dried blood spots by FIA-MS screening and thus speed up differential diagnoses among all the diseases 
screened by C5-OH transition That would allow for earlier introduction of dietary intervention directly from first screening sample The work was
