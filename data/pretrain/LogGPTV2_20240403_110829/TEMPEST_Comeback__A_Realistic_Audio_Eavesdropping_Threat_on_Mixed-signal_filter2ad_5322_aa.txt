ABSTRACT
This study presents a new TEMPEST threat that an attacker can sur-
reptitiously obtain original plain audio information from a distance
by exploiting recently emerging unintentional electromagnetic
(EM) radiations. As lightweight sensor-based Internet of things
(IoT) services become widespread, a mixed-signal system on chip
(MSoC) spontaneously integrates all components, such as digital,
analog, and even power circuits, into a single chipset to minimize
the size of IoT devices. Accordingly, we pay attention to the accel-
erated integration of a switching regulator (SWREG), which is one
of the typical power circuits and may substantially increase the
unintentional EM leakages, re-enabling the audio TEMPEST attack.
In this paper, we posit that a root cause of new audio coupled EM
leakages is the unavoidable integration of SWREG which innately
has strong and low-frequency (i.e., several MHz) switching noises;
an audio signal is conductively coupled on the single common sub-
strate of an MSoC with a system clock and the newly emerging the
SWREG noises. The unique features of the suggested EM leakages
compared to previous leakages are that their frequency distribution
is dense (i.e., at frequency intervals of the SWREG noise), wideband
(i.e., from several MHz to over 1 GHz), and static (i.e., time-invariant
center frequencies). These features make the new TEMPEST attack
due to the SWREG noise have a longer attack range and be more ro-
bust to interferences. Consequently, the presented TEMPEST attack
becomes considerably practical.
To verify the new TEMPEST attack due to the SWREG noise,
we first perform a feasibility analysis by measuring and analyzing
the audio-conveyed EM emanations of the popular MSoCs in an
anechoic chamber. Next, we demonstrate how critical and practical
the threat is by capturing the leakages from the commercial devices
in an office environment. Furthermore, we propose a new signal
reinforcement method with the three benefits (dense, wideband,
and static) of the suggested radiations: the spectral addition of
phase-aligned signals. The experimental results show that the test
sweep tones of the Sogou voice recorder (nRF52810 chipset) and
Xiaomi earbuds (CSR8640 chipset) can be reconstructed over 10
meters. Additionally, an attack feasibility analysis on digital signal

1 INTRODUCTION
Since the deployment of information systems, national intelligence
agencies around the world have continuously devoted efforts to
collect the contents of actual information devices. One of the rep-
resentative attempts performed by the intelligence agencies is to
utilize unintentional radiation leakages, which are electromagnetic
(EM) waves originated from information devices. A well-known
example today is the code name “TEMPEST,” executed by the US Na-
tional Security Agency (NSA) [55]. TEMPEST is generally defined
as a direct leakage of plain-data information due to unintentional

tack approaches using EM emanations on a cryptographic
system.

device using various side-channel information (i.e., EM radiation,
time, power, or heat, etc.) [3, 20–22, 34, 44]. Even though the com-
mon goal of both attacks is to acquire unencrypted plain-data, there
are differences in the way to achieve the same goal. The basic and
conceptual difference between TEMPEST and EM SCCA is simply
explained by referring to the red/black concept [54], as shown in
Figure 1. In a cryptographic system, classified information (i.e.,
plain-data and a key) and encrypted cipher-data are classified into
the red data and black data, respectively. In contrast to the TEM-
PEST attack which directly acquires EM radiations of the red data
as shown in Figure 1(a), EM SCCA aims at recovering the cryp-
tographic key of a target device and eventually obtaining the red
plain-data by decryption of the black data using the key, as shown
in Figure 1(b). From an attacker’s point of view, the crucial strong
point of EM SCCA against TEMPEST is that EM SCCA guarantees
the perfect reconstruction of the red plain-data regardless of the
data type, such as text, image, audio, etc.
However, existing the EM SCCA methods have following innate
limitations compared to TEMPEST in terms of practicability: (a)
short key-recovery distance: the attack range is as far as several
centimeters, (b) non-real-time: in order to get a cryptographic
key, it cannot avoid warm-up time to capture and statistically an-
alyze a lot of EM signal traces, (c) fragileness to interferences:
the attack would fail if the frequency of the interesting EM sig-
nal coincides with that of a commercial radio or spurious signal,
and (d) difficulty in hardware cryptography: even though there
exist the successful attacks on some hardware cryptography im-
plementations (i.e., ASIC [32] or FPGA [33, 42]), the latest SoCs,
which integrate a dedicated cryptographic engine, have not been
successfully attacked yet to the best of our knowledge.
On the other hand, in 2018, Camurati et al. jumped over the
key-recovery distance hurdle of EM SCCA on a mixed-signal SoC
(MSoC) [9]; they showed the successful key recovery at a tinyAES
software implementation from a long distance (10 meters) for the
first time. The key factor of their long-distance achievement was
that they collected the in-band (around 2.5 GHz) leakages which
were radiated via an antenna; the in-band information leakages
could be explained from the inter-modulation with two signals:
the RF carrier (2.4 GHz) and the system clock (64 MHz). This re-
search breakthrough, however, still has EM SCCA’s limitations
except for the key-recovery distance. Although their target device
(nRF52832) internally integrates a hardware cryptographic engine,
the authors did not show any successful result from the radiations
of the hardware AES. Besides, it would be necessary to keep track
of dynamically frequency-hopping radiations in a real Bluetooth
communication environment.
Another new and novel MSoC-based EM SCCA was published,
as known as “Leaky Noise [16].” In this paper, the authors recovered
an encryption key in various MSoCs by exploiting their integrated
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) as a data collection means. Even
though this approach is effective for MSoCs due to the sufficient
proximity between signal sources and the integrated ADCs in a
single chipset, it cannot avoid a less practical assumption that an
adversary should covertly install a malware for a successful attack.
To overcome the practical limitations of the recent EM SCCAs,
we pay attention to the switching regulator (SWREG). In 2019, Shao

EM wave, sound, vibration, etc.; it is explicitly one category of side-
channel attacks which aim at extracting secret information from
a system by analyzing its physical leakages. Figure 1(a) presents
a generalized TEMPEST attack model on a cryptographic system.
Regardless of the key and the cipher-data, the TEMPEST attack tries
to obtain directly the electromagnetically emanated plain-data.
Until the early 1980s, TEMPEST was known as one of the sophis-
ticated attacks that the public could hardly implement. However, in
1985, van Eck published an experimental result analyzing the EM
emanations from a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. He merely used
a $15 TV receiver and reconstructed the CRT screen at a distance
of several hundred meters [11]. After the first success, TEMPEST
attacks on various computer peripherals have attracted academic
attention. Figure 2(a) shows a restored LCD monitor screen from
3 meters in [25]. However, since the mid-2000s, the design of elec-
tronic devices has been shaped by a rapid trend of miniaturization,
low power consumption, and the system on a chip (SoC) evolution.
These rapid trend changes, as well as regulations on electromag-
netic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC),
resulted in a significant reduction of unintentional EM emanations.
Consequently, the TEMPEST attack has not been recognized as a
realistic threat anymore. The representative evidence was NSA’s
latest intelligence technology that was revealed by Edward Snow-
den in 2013. By implanting an RF retroreflector into a video cable
[53], they changed their offense strategy from the conventional
all-passive approach (e.g., TEMPEST) to a semi-active approach.
Subsequently, owing to the difficulty of the TEMPEST attack,
offensive research on electronic devices exploiting unintended EM
emanations has focused on the side-channel cryptographic attack
Session 4B: Physical Attacks CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA1086et al. also focused on the SWREG, they proposed a new power
analysis side-channel attack technique for extracting data by ex-
ploiting the computers’ SWREG noises [41]. With the trends of
SoC evolution and integration of SWREG, we paradoxically also
find out that the audio TEMPEST threat on recent SWREG-integrated
MSoCs is coming back to real-world situations. According to its op-
eration mechanism, SWREG has innate strong and low-frequency
(several MHz) switching noises; and an audio signal is conductively
coupled on the single common substrate of the MSoC with a sys-
tem clock and the newly emerging switching noises; the coupled
audio signals on the substrate are emitted externally. The strong
noise characteristics of SWREG make it possible for an attacker to
perform a successful audio TEMPEST on the MSoC. Furthermore,
the new SWREG noise-based EM audio radiations have following
unique frequency distribution features related to the characteristics
of the SWREG noises: (a) dense: the periodic frequency intervals
of the audio leaks are quite narrow (i.e., the frequency of SWREG),
(b) wideband: there exist the strong EM radiations over the wide-
frequency range (i.e., from several MHz to over 1 GHz), and (c)
static: compared to the carrier frequency hopping of Bluetooth
in “Screaming Channel [9],” the carrier frequencies of the audio
leaks are time-invariant. The features also make the new TEMPEST
attack become considerably practical. The key factor making the
attack be practical is that the new attack is able to overcome all
the aforementioned four limitations of EM SCCA. The character-
istics of the new TEMPEST attack are as follows: (a) long attack
range: the attack range could be increased if an attacker combines
the dense signals together, (b) real-time: the new attack needs
not any cryptographic key and corresponding warm-up time, (c)
interference-robustness: the attacker can avoid the interferences
by simply altering the interesting frequency to one of the numerous
neighboring signals, and (d) irrelevance to cryptography imple-
mentations: regardless of software/hardware cryptography imple-
mentations, the plain audio data can be obtained directly since it is
not EM SCCA but the TEMPEST attack.
In order to help understanding and show that the suggested
hypotheses are correct in advance, we show Figure 2(b), which
is a measured example of the reconstructed audio spectrograms;
the target device is the nRF52840 MSoC and attack distances are
15 centimeters and 5 meters, respectively. The restored audio sig-
nals at remote sites demonstrate sufficient spectrum similarity and
intelligibility in comparison to the original one.
The objectives of this study are as follows:

The contributions of this study are as follows:

coupled unwanted radiations but also experimentally verify its
generation mechanism.

• We verify that the threat is a critical security risk by demonstrat-
ing that the EM radiations from commercial audio IoT devices

and suggest inherent attack potentials on various IoT sensors.
• Based on the presented generative principle and the experi-
mental results, we suggest several practical countermeasures to
reduce the emanation of undesirable signals by MSoCs.
In the next section, we explain essential research trends and the-
ories to aid the comprehension of this study. In Section 3, the threat
model and feasibility analysis results on five MSoCs are illustrated.
To illustrate that the threat is one of realistic issues, we show the
attack results on commercial devices in a real environment in Sec-
tion 4. In Section 5, we propose a new cooperative reconstruction
method for an increase of the attack range and show experimental
results. In Section 6, additionally, we analyze and discuss the vul-
nerability of a digital signal on an MSoC. In Section 7, we suggest
and discuss the countermeasures against the new threat. Finally,
this paper is concluded in Section 8.
2 BACKGROUNDS
2.1 Research on TEMPEST
Following the first van Eck’s successful TV signal restoration [11],
Smulders restored the original data by using leaked EM waves on
shielded and unshielded RS-232 cables from a few meters away
in 1990 [43]. In the early 2000s, Kuhn published a study on the
reconstruction of a screen by using reflected optical information
originated from a CRT monitor [23]; he also analyzed the EM waves
emitted from an LCD monitor and a DVI cable at a distance of
several meters [24, 25]. In 2006, Tosaka proved the possibility of
restoring the printer’s information by measuring the weak leak
signals of a laser printer at a distance of several millimeters [47].
