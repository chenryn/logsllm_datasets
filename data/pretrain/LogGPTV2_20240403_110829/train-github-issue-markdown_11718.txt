Matplotlib pcolormesh introduces spurious features along the prime meridian
when deployed with a PolarStereo projection.

    from netCDF4 import Dataset
    import cartopy.crs as ccrs
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    # Double check the versions
    import cartopy
    import matplotlib
    print(matplotlib.__version__)
    print(cartopy.__version__)
    # Import the data
    dat = Dataset('my_data.nc')
    # my_data.nc is an ice motion vector file available (after logging in) here: https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0116
    # The particular file I've used is icemotion_daily_nh_25km_20140101_20141231_v4.1.nc
    # I've attached a stripped-down version to this report as a zip file, just unzip and name it my_data.nc
    # It's a netcdf with an irregular grid (EASE equal area) with 2d arrays of lons, lats and data vals.
    lons = dat['longitude']
    lats = dat['latitude']
    data = dat['u']
    # Make the plot
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))    
    ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.NorthPolarStereo())
    ax.pcolormesh(lons, lats, data ,transform=ccrs.PlateCarree())
    ax.set_extent([-180, 180, 90, 65], ccrs.PlateCarree())
    ax.coastlines()
    plt.show()
**Actual outcome**
This is the output with mpl 3.3.0 and cartopy 0.18

**Expected outcome**
This is the expected output, generated with mpl 3.2.2 and cartopy 0.18

Installed with conda. To generate the correct plot, I had a downgrade my
matplotlib version. To do this I did conda remove matplotlib, and then conda
install -c conda-forge matplotlib=3.1.3, and then conda install cartopy=0.18
One notable feature of this bug is that it is not visible when the bounding
latitude is at or below 55 degrees. Here are two plots I've made (where the
plotted data is just the latitude coord with bounding lats of 55 and 56
degrees.

I'm aware that this problem is common when deploying pcolormesh with a regular
grid, where each of the rows of the 2d data can be characterised by a single
lat, and each col by a single lon (i.e. data points are regularly spaced in
lon/lat space, this is also known as raster data). The solution to this is to
insert a cyclic point at the meridian, in cartopy this is achieved with
cartopy.util.add_cyclic_point. This solution is characterised here. This
cannot be done in for an irregular grid, such as the EASE grid, but this
didn't cause a problem until mpl 3.3.0. This is not a corner case however, as
irregular grids are the norm for polar research (for reasons involving the
infinitessimal area of regular lon/lat grid cells near the pole).
