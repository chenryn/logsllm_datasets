It would be beneficial to introduce a `SimpleJdbcUpdate` feature, similar to the existing `SimpleJdbcInsert`. This new feature should accept two maps as parameters. The first map would contain the column names and their corresponding updated values, while the second map would include the column names and their respective values for the WHERE clause.

Additionally, there should be an overloaded method that accepts only a single string (representing a column name) to be used in the WHERE clause.
