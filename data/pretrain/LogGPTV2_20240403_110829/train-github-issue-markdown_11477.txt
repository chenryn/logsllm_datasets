It would be great if we have something like SimpleJdbcUpdate similar to
SimpleJdbcInsert. It should take map and another
map as parameters and it should update table based
on that.  
The column names in the second map should appear in the WHERE clause. There
should be an overloaded method also which takes only one String(column name)
which should appear in the WHERE clause.
