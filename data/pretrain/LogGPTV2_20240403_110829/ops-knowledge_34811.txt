### Issue with `pip` on AWS EC2 with Amazon Linux

**Server Details:**
- **Server:** AWS EC2
- **Operating System:** Amazon Linux
- **Python Version:** 2.7.10

**Current `pip` Version:**

```bash
$ pip --version
pip 7.1.2 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
```

This version works correctly.

**Issue with `sudo pip`:**

When running `pip` with `sudo`, the following error occurs:

```bash
$ sudo pip --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 3020, in <module>
    working_set = WorkingSet._build_master()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 616, in _build_master
    return cls._build_from_requirements(__requires__)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 629, in _build_from_requirements
    dists = ws.resolve(reqs, Environment())
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 807, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: pip==6.1.1
```

**Explanation:**
It appears that there are two versions of `pip` installed:
- `/usr/bin/pip` for the `sudo` user, which is causing the issue.
- `/usr/local/bin/pip` for the regular user, which is working correctly.

**Solution:**
To use the higher version of `pip` when running as `sudo`, you can specify the full path to the correct `pip` executable. For example, to install Jupyter, you can run:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install jupyter
```

This command will ensure that the higher version of `pip` is used, avoiding the `DistributionNotFound` error.
