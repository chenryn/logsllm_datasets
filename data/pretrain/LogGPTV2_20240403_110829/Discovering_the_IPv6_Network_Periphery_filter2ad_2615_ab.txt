probing: we coordinated with the network administrators of the vantage point
prior to our experiments and hosted an informative web page on the vantage
point itself describing the experiment and providing opt-out instructions. We
received no opt-out requests during this work.

From Sept. to Oct. 2019 we ran edgy from a well-connected server in Lausanne,
Switzerland. Edgy used yarrp at less than 10 kpps with the neighborhood TTL
setting to reduce load on routers within ﬁve hops of the vantage point.

4.1 BGP-Informed Seed Results
Initializing edgy with the BGP-informed seed data yielded 130,447 candidate
/48 preﬁxes. Following Algorithm 2, edgy traced to a random IID in each of the
256 constituent /56 subnets in each /48s (a total of 33,394,432 distinct traces).
This ﬁrst round of probing 33.4M targets discovered 4.6M unique, non-aliased
last hop IPv6 addresses residing in 33,831 distinct /48 preﬁxes (Table 1). Often,
the last hop address is not contained within the target /48 preﬁx but in a diﬀerent
/48 preﬁx belonging to the same Autonomous System (AS). Further, probing
diﬀerent target /48 preﬁxes in round one resulted in last hops within the same
/48 (but diﬀerent than the target /48). This phenomenon of a many-to-one
relationship between the target preﬁx and the last hop preﬁx persists across
rounds as the probing granularity increases.
The density of discovered last hop addresses across target preﬁxes is non-
uniform: nearly 75% of the targeted /48 preﬁxes produce 16 or fewer distinct
last hops. The preﬁxes in which the last hops reside is also highly non-uniform.
Of the 33,831 /48s in which last hop addresses reside, 11,064 were responsible for
only a single last hop address. This is likely indicative of a /48 allocation to an
end site. On the other end of the spectrum, a single /48 (2001:1970:4000::/48)
contained over 200,000 unique last hop addresses. 2001:1970:4000::/48 was the
last hop preﬁx in traces to 1,008 distinct /48 target preﬁxes, the most extreme
example of many target /48s mapping to a single last hop preﬁx.
Because a /48 preﬁx entirely subnetted into /52s should exhibit 16 distinct
last hops, we choose η = 16 empirically as a baseline indication of more granular
subnetting. The choice and sensitivity of η are discussed in detail in [30].
34,520 of the input 130,447 /48 target preﬁxes passed the η threshold in
round one. Each of these /48 preﬁxes were then probed at a /60 granularity
(4,096 probes to each /48). Edgy discovers signiﬁcantly more unique non-aliased
last hop addresses in this round, ∼12.2M, as the probing is focused on known
address-producing target subnetworks identiﬁed in the ﬁrst round.
To select target /48s for round three, we use η = 256 as an indicator of
subnetting at a granularity ﬁner than /56. 12,014 /48s meet this criteria, and
were used as targets for probing at the /62 granularity (∼196.8M traces).
Round three, while probing <10% of the input target seed preﬁxes, is focused
on those with ﬁne-grained subnetting and helps to expose subnetting strategies.

As the IETF now discourages, but does not forbid, /64 or more-speciﬁc sub-
netting [25], we are interested in the prevalence of ﬁne-grained subnetting, but
must balance inferring this delegation behavior with probing load. Because sub-
netting generally occurs on nybble boundaries [25], by probing /62s, we are able
to detect when target preﬁxes are subnetted beyond /60s, which is an indica-
tion that perhaps the operator is allocating /64 subnets. The /62 probing round
produced ∼14.7M unique last hop addresses.
The ﬁnal round is designed to enumerate last hop addresses for /64 subnets.
Edgy selects any preﬁx with η = 4 preﬁx-unique last hops within a /60 (because
we probe each /62, each /60 contains four targets). We surmise that four preﬁx-
unique last hops is an indication that either the operator subnets at the /62
level, or is assigning /64 networks to their customers. The ﬁnal /64 probing
round discovered 15.3M distinct IPv6 addresses through exhaustive probing of
2,641 /48 target preﬁxes that met the η threshold to be in round four.
Cumulatively, edgy discovers more than 37M distinct IPv6 last hop addresses
using the BGP-informed seed. Table 1 quantiﬁes discovery across probing rounds.
3,989 ASs are represented in the last hop addresses, corresponding to 143 coun-
tries, as reported by Team Cymru’s IP to ASN service [33]. Figures 5 and 6
summarize the ASes and countries that produced the largest number of periph-
ery last hop addresses.
4.2 Hitlist-Informed Seed Results
We replicate the experiment described in Sect. 4.1 seeded with the hitlist-
informed seed traces (from [7]). Table 1 shows the per-round results for both
the BGP-informed and hitlist-informed seeds. Algorithm 1 on this input seed
yielded 111,670 target /48 preﬁxes, about 20k fewer than the BGP-informed
seed. However, the initial /56 probing round discovered nearly twice as many
unique last hop addresses. The hitlist-informed seed led to almost double the
number of target preﬁxes in the /60 round as compared to the BGP-informed
seed, but discovered nearly 1M fewer last hops. As a result, only 4,462 /48 tar-
get preﬁxes were probed in the /62 probing round, discovering 5.4M last hops
from 19,942 /48 preﬁxes. 1,531 target /48s were exhaustively probed at the /64
Discovering the IPv6 Network Periphery
11
granularity in the fourth round, about 1% of the input hitlist seed preﬁxes. The
/64 probing round discovered over 15M unique last hops, indicating that the
1,500 target /48s each contributed about 10,000 unique addresses on average.
We attribute the diﬀerences between the BGP-informed and hitlist-informed
seed data results to diﬀerences in how the original source data was collected.
For example, the BGP-informed seed data was derived from a uniform sweep of
the advertised IPv6 space, while the hitlist-informed seed data derived from a
measurement campaign aimed at networks known to be dense in customers.
In total, periphery on the hitlist-informed seed discovers over 29M unique
last hop router addresses. Nearly half of those addresses are found in the /64
probing round, during which edgy exhaustively probes all of the /64s in 1,531 /48
target preﬁxes. This suggests that a small number of preﬁxes have ﬁne-grained
subnetting, and that substantial periphery topology can be gained by probing a
carefully selected set of target preﬁxes. Figures 5 and 6 display the top ten ASes
and countries from which we obtain last hops; for the hitlist-informed seed, 141
countries and 3,578 ASNs contribute to the total.
4.3 Edginess Metrics
To better understand the extent to which edgy discovers IPv6 periphery infras-
tructure, we introduce three metrics of “edginess.” The ﬁrst coarse metric is
simply the fraction of traces with a last hop within the same AS as the probe
destination. Clearly, this condition does not imply that the last hop is truly an
interface of the periphery router. However, it provides a rudimentary measure
of whether traces are reaching the target network’s AS. In contrast, a trace to a
non-existent network will be dropped at an earlier hop in a default-free network.
We compare edgy’s results against a day’s worth of CAIDA’s IPv6 Ark tracer-
oute results from 105 diﬀerent vantage points on Oct 1, 2019 [8]. Across nearly
17M traceroutes performed on that day, 1.7M (10%) produced a response from
the target destination. However, of those 1.7M traceroutes that reached the
destination, 86.2% were from probing the ::1 address, while 13.3% came from
destinations known to be aliased, i.e., a fake reply. Unsurprisingly, fewer than
0.5% of the probes to random targets reached the destination.
40.2% of the CAIDA traces elicit a response from a last hop address that
belongs to a BGP preﬁx originated by the same AS as the destination. In con-
trast, 87.1% of edgy’s traces reach the target AS. While these results cannot be
directly compared – edgy performs two orders of magnitude more traces than
CAIDA; see Sect. 4.7 – it does demonstrate that the probing performed by edgy
is in fact largely reaching the target network, if not the periphery.
Our second edginess metric is a more granular measure of how deep into the
target network, and hence how close to the periphery, traces traverse. For each
trace, we ﬁnd the number of most signiﬁcant bits (MSBs) that match between
the target and the last hop response, i.e., the netmask of the most speciﬁc IPv6
preﬁx that encompasses the target and last hop. As before, this metric does not
provide a deﬁnitive measure of reaching the periphery. Indeed, we empirically
observe many networks that use very diﬀerent IPv6 preﬁxes for the last hop

point-to-point subnetwork as compared to the customer’s preﬁx. However, the
basis of this metric is that hierarchical routing implies more matching MSBs the
closer the trace gets to the target.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of matching bits across the traceroutes from
both CAIDA and edgy. Whereas the median size of the matching preﬁx is a /13
for CAIDA, it is nearly a /32 for edgy. The target and last hop share the same
/48 for more than 5% of the edgy traces, but just 2% of the CAIDA traces.
Thus, again, we see edgy’s probing reaching more of the network periphery.
Finally, we quantify how many of our last hop addresses appear only as
periphery addresses in our traces, and therefore do not appear as an interme-
diate hop in traceroutes to other target addresses. In the BGP-informed seed’s
ﬁrst round, 0.9% of discovered last hop addresses to a target appear as an inter-
mediate hop to another target. In the second round, the same is true of 21% of
last hops, 23% in the third round, and 4% in the fourth probing round. However,
closer examination indicates that these numbers, particularly in the second and
third round, are skewed by providers that frequently cycle periphery preﬁxes.
For example, in the second round, 1.6M of the 2.5M addresses seen both as a
last and an intermediate hop are located in ASN8881, which we observe cycling
customer preﬁxes on a daily basis [30]. This often causes traces to appear to
“bounce” between two (or more) diﬀerent addresses toward the end of a trace.
Sorting by the time the response was received shows that a single IPv6 address
was responsible for high hop count responses until after a distinct point at which
a second address becomes responsive. This erroneously causes the address that
was not responsible for the highest hop count response to appear as if it were
an intermediate hop for the target.
We also observe a second class of IPv6 address that appears both as a last
hop and an intermediate hop to other targets. These addresses appear as the last
hop for a large number of target networks that are most likely unallocated by
the provider; these addresses typically have low entropy IID (e.g., ::1 or ::2) and
Discovering the IPv6 Network Periphery

are likely provider infrastructure. These last hop addresses also appear on the
path to addresses that appear to be CPE, based on the high entropy or EUI-64
last hop returned when they are an intermediate hop.
