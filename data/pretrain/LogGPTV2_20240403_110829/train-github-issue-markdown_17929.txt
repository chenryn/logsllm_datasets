### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** master
- **Operating System/Platform:** Windows 64-bit
- **Compiler:** Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64

### Detailed Description
When configuring the master branch of OpenCV on a Windows system with the `CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION` option enabled, the CMake configuration process fails with the following errors:

```
CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVUtils.cmake:331 (target_include_directories):
  Cannot specify include directories for target "opencv_test_core_SSE4_1"
  which is not built by this project.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/OpenCVModule.cmake:675 (ocv_target_include_directories)
  cmake/OpenCVModule.cmake:1239 (ocv_target_include_modules)
  modules/core/CMakeLists.txt:97 (ocv_add_accuracy_tests)

CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVUtils.cmake:331 (target_include_directories):
  Cannot specify include directories for target "opencv_test_core_SSE4_2"
  which is not built by this project.

```

Similar errors occur for other components that are selected for building.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Operating System:** Windows 10 x64
2. **CMake Version:** v3.7.2
3. **Steps:**
   - Clone the OpenCV repository.
   - Checkout the `master` branch.
   - Run CMake Configure with the following settings:
     - Generator: Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64
     - Option: `CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION` checked

By following these steps, you should encounter the CMake configuration errors described above.
