##### Detailed description
When doing Configure on master branch in Windows with CV_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION
checked, it causes the CMake configuration process to fail on errors like
these:
    CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVUtils.cmake:331 (target_include_directories):
      Cannot specify include directories for target "opencv_test_core_SSE4_1"
      which is not built by this project.
    Call Stack (most recent call first):
      cmake/OpenCVModule.cmake:675 (ocv_target_include_directories)
      cmake/OpenCVModule.cmake:1239 (ocv_target_include_modules)
      modules/core/CMakeLists.txt:97 (ocv_add_accuracy_tests)
    CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVUtils.cmake:331 (target_include_directories):
      Cannot specify include directories for target "opencv_test_core_SSE4_2"
      which is not built by this project.
    Call Stack (most recent call first):

      cmake/OpenCVModule.cmake:1239 (ocv_target_include_modules)
      modules/core/CMakeLists.txt:97 (ocv_add_accuracy_tests)

and many more of the same error for the various components that are selected
for building.
