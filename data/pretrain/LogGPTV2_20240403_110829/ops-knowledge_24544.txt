User: So I installed pydiction into vim for autocompleting my python code in windows. No problemo. Worked like a charm. 
Tried the same thing with my Ubuntu setup, creating the .vim/after/ftplugin directory in my home folder and updating the vimrc with the correct path of the pydiction dictionary but I fail every time. Why is that ? I follow the readme.txt closely , I even found a webpage that describes the process on ubuntu again repeating the same things , nothing. 
Each time I tab after i type "raw" while it worked in windows in ubuntu it reports "Dictionary Completion (^K^N^P) Pattern not Found". Tried other keyword , same problem. Anyone has an idea why this happens ?
Assistant: Problem has been solved, apparently gvim did not like the fact that i put the files in a ".vim" directory even though that was exactly what the instructions told me to do. I put them in my home folder pydiction.vim and complete-dictionary and now it works ok, with no issues.
Now autocomplete works with any word I tried it with. I am abit confused with gvim , as the instructions said to create ".vim" directory but I have also found a vimfiles directory in a etc folder. Why vim structure is so confusing? Maybe the manual should clarify directory structure to avoid confusing. Now I use a source command to load pydiction.vim from my home folder and setup the vimrc properly to point to the new paths. 
At least I solved my problem myself , thanks for all replies.
