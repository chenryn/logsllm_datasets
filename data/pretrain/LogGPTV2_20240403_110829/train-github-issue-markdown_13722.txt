Challenge [Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery]
Hi I can't seem to pass the challenge. Tried searching for other related posts
on the bug issue but to no avail.
My code:
      jQuery Playground
          #left-well
            #target1
            #target2
            #target3
          #right-well
            #target4
            #target5
            #target6
