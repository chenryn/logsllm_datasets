### Challenge: Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery

I'm having trouble passing the challenge and have tried searching for related posts, but I haven't found a solution.

Here is my code:

```html
<div id="left-well">
  <div id="target1"></div>
  <div id="target2"></div>
  <div id="target3"></div>
</div>

<div id="right-well">
  <div id="target4"></div>
  <div id="target5"></div>
  <div id="target6"></div>
</div>
```

Could you please help me identify what I might be doing wrong?
