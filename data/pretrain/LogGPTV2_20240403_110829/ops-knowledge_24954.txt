User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题nmap reports a remote host as up, while it is down? I want to remotely examine if some servers are up. 

I don't use the ping command because it gives a lot of wrong results like
"destination host unreachable" and "request Timed out" due to bad networking infrastructure.

I try to use nmap command to examine servers by open ports. Nmap gives me the real opened ports, but when I turn off the server, nmap still reports it running. 

The client logs into the internet through a usb modem, and the destination host that I examine is connected to the internet through a TP-Link Access point with usb modem and a static IP.

When I turn off the access point completely and I run this command:

nmap -p 80 -vv 105.198.224.47

Host is up, received syn-ack (0.55s latency).

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.78 seconds


And when put the ip in a browser it gives:

"This site can’t be reached"

"The connection was reset."

This happens in both situations when it is turned on and turned off.

traceroute when the access point is turned on gives:

running traceroute when the access point turned off gives the same result but the changes only in values of milli seconds ms.

So, what the explanation of this behaviour?

Assistant: What do you have, network-wise, between you and your servers ?

Any active element (router, firewall, etc.) can modify your trafic, hence:


the fact that ping does not work can be unrelated to your server state. ICMP trafic is often something completely filtered out
your nmap case is stranger, but can still be explained the same way, it also depends if you use a name or an IP


In both cases to really monitor things you should use a service you control on the server (like ssh, http or something more specific), connect to it and verify that you get back what you expect (a specific result).
