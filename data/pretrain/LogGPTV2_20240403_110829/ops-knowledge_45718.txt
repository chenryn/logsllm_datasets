User: How to build a highly available MySQL cluster? Please introduce the steps and precautions in detail.
Assistant: To build a high-availability MySQL cluster, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Data synchronization scheme: Different nodes in the cluster must be able to achieve data synchronization to ensure data consistency. Usually, schemes such as master-slave synchronization and semi-synchronous replication are adopted. 2. Load balancing scheme: In order to avoid a node from being overloaded, a load balancing scheme is required to distribute requests to different nodes for processing. 3. Failover scheme: When a node in the cluster fails, it needs to be able to automatically transfer the request to other available nodes for processing. The following are the steps of a basic high-availability MySQL cluster: 1. Determine the cluster size and architecture: determine how many nodes need to run in the cluster and which architecture to adopt, such as one master with multiple slaves, master-slave replication, etc. For large-scale clusters, consider using a distributed architecture. 2. Deploy MySQL nodes: Install MySQL on each node. 3. Configure the database: configure the corresponding database for each node, including master-slave replication, semi-synchronous replication, etc. 4. Deploy a load balancer: deploy a load balancer at the front end of the cluster to forward requests to different nodes. 5. Configure failover: Configure failover schemes such as automatic switching and automatic restart to ensure that each node in the cluster can assume the task of the master node. 6. Configuration monitoring: Deploy the monitoring system to monitor the cluster status, node status and performance in real time, and handle faults and other situations in a timely manner. Note: 1. The time between nodes needs to be kept in sync, otherwise it will cause abnormal data synchronization. 2. For master-slave nodes, the performance of the master node must be strong enough to avoid performance bottlenecks. 3. When a failure occurs, it needs to be dealt with in time to ensure that the node can be repaired or replaced in time. 4. Data backup and recovery: Do not store all backups in the same location to prevent a single point of failure. In addition, when performing data recovery, it is necessary to ensure that the latest data backup is restored.
