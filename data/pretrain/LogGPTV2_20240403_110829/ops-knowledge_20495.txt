User: Please use Python to implement a simple web application that supports the POST method.
Assistant: Here is an implementation based on the Flask framework. First you need to install Flask: ```python pip install flask ``` Then create a file named app.py, the code is as follows: ```python from flask import Flask, request app = Flask(__name__) @app.route( '/', methods=['GET', 'POST']) def hello_world(): if request.method == 'POST': # Process POST request data = request.get_json() # Get POST request data # Processing logic ... return 'POST Request: {}'.format(data) else: # Process GET request return 'Hello, World!' app.run() ``` This application contains a processing route of '/' Function, it will perform different processing operations according to the method of the request. If it is a POST request, get the requested JSON data from the request and process it, and finally return the processing result. If it is a GET request, it will directly return "Hello, World!". Then run the app.py file in the terminal: ```python python app.py ``` At this time, you can visit the http://localhost:5000/ address in the browser and get the output of "Hello, World!". To simulate a POST request, use the curl tool on the command line: ```python curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John", "age": 30} ' http://localhost:5000/ ``` This command will initiate a POST request to the application with JSON data (name and age). You can see that the Python application will output: ``` POST Request: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30} ``` This completes the implementation of a simple web application that supports the POST method.
