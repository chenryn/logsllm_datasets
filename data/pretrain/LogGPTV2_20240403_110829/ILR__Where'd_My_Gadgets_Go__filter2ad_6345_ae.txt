The provided text appears to be a mix of special characters, symbols, and fragments of technical content. It is challenging to discern the exact intended message or context from this input. However, I will attempt to reconstruct and optimize the readable parts of the text, focusing on the technical content related to Instruction Location Randomization (ILR) and its effects on security and performance.

### Impact of ILR on ROP Attacks

**Figure 9: Percentage of Instructions Moved Using ILR**
- **Results:** ILR can randomize the location of almost all instructions within an arbitrary binary program, thereby enhancing security against attacks.

**Figure 10: Effect of ILR on ROP Attack Vectors**
- **First Bar:** Shows the percentage of unique gadgets moved by ILR. Over 94% of gadgets are moved on average.
  - **Worst Case:** 483.xalancbmk, with only 87% of gadgets moved.
- **Second Bar:** Results for ROPgadget version 3.1. Over 90% of gadgets are hidden in all cases, with an average of 96%.
  - **Note:** Version 3.1 located slightly more gadgets in the ILR-protected version but found many more in the unprotected version, indicating that ILR effectively hides most gadgets even with advanced gadget identification frameworks.
- **Third Bar:** Counts all gadgets, including duplicates. On average, 99.96% of total gadgets have their locations randomized.
  - **Average Remaining Gadgets:** Only 2.48 gadgets remain in the program.
  - **Worst Case:** 483.xalancbmk has 6 unique gadgets, compared to 67 in the unprotected program. Six gadgets are insufficient for most attacks, as even simple attack templates require 8 or 9 gadgets.
  - **Unprotected Program:** The gadget compiler can generate an attack payload for every program, and both attacks are automatically detected as possible in 9 benchmarks. In contrast, no attack payloads are successfully generated in the protected program.

**ILR+ (Enhanced ILR)**
- **Further Reduction in Attack Probability:** Most ILR+ protected applications have only one gadget (21 out of 29 benchmarks). This single gadget is typically an `int 0x80` sequence, which alone cannot mount an attack.
  - **Average Remaining Gadgets with ILR+:** Only 1.5 gadgets remain available.

### Performance Metrics

**1. Run-time Overhead**
- **Figure 11: Performance Overhead**
  - **Base VM (Strata):** Adds most of the overhead, with an average of 8%.
  - **ILR Overhead:** Additional 8% on average.
  - **Note:** The extra overhead primarily affects short-running but large code size benchmarks, such as 400.perlbench and 403.gcc.
