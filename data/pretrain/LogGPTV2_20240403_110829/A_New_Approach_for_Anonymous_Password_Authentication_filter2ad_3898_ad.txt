### Unforgeability of CL Signature
A CL signature \((v, k, s)\) ensures that an outsider cannot generate \(E_1\), which would make the server accept \(\mathcal{F}(V)\). This property is known as unforgeability [12]. It is worth noting that the user's message does not include any freshness data from the server, making replay attacks possible. However, this issue can be mitigated by incorporating a timestamp or an additional round of interaction.

Moreover, \(\mathcal{F}(V)\) essentially asserts that \(vk = a^c \mod n\). This is not a concern, as no one can compute such \((v, k)\) without the server's assistance. Furthermore, the same level of security as the original CL signature can be achieved if the server uses a variant satisfying \(vk = a^m b^{s'} \mod n\), with \((v, k, s, s')\) being the credential.

### Authentication of the Server to the User
The server authenticates itself to the user using \(E_1'\). An outsider cannot decrypt \(E_1'\) and obtain \(X^*\), and consequently, cannot compute \(s_1'\) that will be accepted by the user. This ensures the secrecy of the session key.

### Secrecy of Session Key
The shared session key \(sk\) is established through the exchange of \(X\) and \(Y\) via the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange protocol. Given the authentication property, the exchange of \(X\) and \(Y\) is secure, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. An outsider observing the communication between the user and the server can only learn \(Y\). Therefore, the outsider cannot compute \(g^{xy}\). Even if the outsider learns \(X\), they still cannot compute \(g^{xy}\) from \(X\) and \(Y\) due to the (computational) DH assumption.

### Off-line Guessing Attacks
Our scheme is a two-round protocol: the user requests, and the server responds. Active adversarial behaviors, such as impersonation, do not provide more advantages for off-line guessing attacks compared to passive interception. The server will only respond if it is assured of the user's genuineness. The data that may be useful to a passive outsider in off-line guessing attacks include \(\langle E_1, E_2 \rangle\), \(E_1'\), \(\mathcal{F}(V)\), and \([s_1']_{tk}\). As discussed, from \(E_1\) and \(E_2\), an outsider cannot succeed in off-line guessing attacks because the known structure of the CL signature has been broken. \(E_1'\) and \(\mathcal{F}(V)\) do not help in off-line guessing attacks either, as the zero-knowledge proofs do not reveal information about the items to be proved. \([s_1']_{tk}\) is also of no use to the outsider for off-line guessing attacks, considering the secrecy of \(tk\).

### Unlinkability
As discussed, the user provides a distinct \(s_1'\) each time, and \(s_1' \neq s_1\), ensuring that the server cannot link users based on \(s_1\) and \(s_1'\). Additionally, \(b^{s_1'} r \neq b^{s_1} r\) each time, further preventing the server from linking users. To examine whether \(\mathcal{F}(V)\) helps the server link users, we consider a scenario where the server tries to break unlinkability by using the user's credential \((v, k, s)\). In the CL signature scheme, \(\mathcal{F}(V)\) consists of a set of zero-knowledge proofs, each proving knowledge of \(x\) without revealing \(x\). The server, even knowing \(x\), cannot associate \(\mathcal{F}(Cx)\) with \(x\) in an information-theoretic sense. For any \(\tilde{x}\), there exists a corresponding \(\tilde{r}\) satisfying \(Cx = g^{\tilde{x}} h^{\tilde{r}}\). It can be verified that \((C, S_1, S_2)\) is a valid zero-knowledge proof for any such pair \(\tilde{x}, \tilde{r}\).

### Implementation Results

#### Limited Scalability of Generic Construction
We have analyzed that the computational overhead on the server in conventional anonymous password authentication is linear with the total number of users, leading to scalability issues in large systems. To empirically determine the severity of this problem, we implemented the generic construction proposed in Section IV. While specific schemes might be more efficient, the difference should not be drastic in principle.

In this implementation, we used the trivial Private Information Retrieval (PIR) solution in Step 3, where the server sends all \(e_j\)s along with \(Auth_S\). We used 2048-bit Paillier homomorphic encryption and SHA-1 for \(h(.)\). Figure 2 shows the experimental results with respect to different numbers of passwords in the server's password file.

#### Performance of Our New Scheme
To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we implemented a simple prototype in C/C++ using the Crypto++ libraries [15]. The client program runs on a Fujitsu notebook with an Intel Core2 Duo CPU (2.53GHz) and Windows Vista, while the server program runs on a PC with an Intel Pentium D CPU (3.00GHz) and Windows XP. Our testing results show that it takes approximately 0.8 seconds for the user and the server to complete the authentication protocol, averaged over 200 runs.

### Conclusion
Anonymous password authentication offers the benefits of password authentication while providing user privacy. However, it has intrinsic weaknesses in the standard setting. To address these, we proposed a new approach assuming users use password-protected credentials. Our implemented prototype demonstrated good performance for real applications. Future work will address issues such as user revocation.
