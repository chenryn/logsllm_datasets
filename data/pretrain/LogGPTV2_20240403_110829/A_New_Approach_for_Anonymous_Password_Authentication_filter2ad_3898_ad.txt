CL signature (v, k, s), an outsider is not able to generate E
1,
which makes the server accept (cid:6)(V ). This is the unforge-
ability of the CL signature [12]. We notice that the user’s
message contains no freshness data from the server, so replay
is possible. But this is not a big issue, since using timestamp
or an extra round of interaction sufﬁces to solve the problem.

Note also that (cid:6)(V ) essentially asserts vk = a
c, but again
this is not an issue, since no one can compute such (v, k)
without the help of the server; better yet, it is easy to
attain the same strength as the original CL signature if the

Secrecy of Session Key. Establishment of the shared ses-
sion key sk is through the exchange of X and Y by DH key
exchange protocol. Given the authentication property, the
exchange of X, Y is authenticated, so an outsider cannot
play main-in-the-middle. As such, an outsider observing
communication between user and server can learn Y only.
Thus the outsider is unable to compute gxy. Note that even
the outsider also learns X, he still cannot compute gxy from
X, Y , according to the (computational) DH assumption.
Off-line Guessing Attacks. Our scheme is a two-round
protocol: user-requests-then-server-responds. Active adver-
sarial behaviors such as impersonation do not gain an
outsider more advantages in terms of off-line guessing
attacks than passive interception of communication, because
the server will not respond unless he is assured of the
genuineness of the user. With this in mind, the data that may
be helpful to a passive outsider in off-line guessing attacks

server link users. It is important to know that by off-line
guessing attacks, the server can learn all users’ passwords,
and in turn all credentials. For the analysis, let us consider a
scenario, which is the most favorable to the server trying to
break unlinkability: the server happens to use U’s credential
(v, k, s) to determine whether his counterpart indeed uses
this credential. In the CL signature scheme, (cid:6)(V ) consists
of a set of zero-knowledge proofs, each of which is of
the following form: to prove the knowledge of x, the user
computes Cx = gx

then constructs (cid:6)(Cx) = N P oK{(χ, γ) : gχ

Figure 3 shows the client program. To initiate a login, the
user needs to input his password, and indicate the password-
protected credential to be read. Our current implementa-
tion supports downloading the password-protected credential
from a FTP server, or reading it from a USB external device
(e.g., USB ﬂash memory). Then the user clicks “OK” button,
and the client program starts the proposed authentication
protocol with the server. Our testing results show that it takes
about 0.8 second for the user and the server to complete the
authentication protocol. We obtained this average time from
200 runs of the protocol.

a corresponding (cid:22)r, satisfying Cx = g (cid:22)x

veriﬁed that (C, S1, S2) is a valid zero-knowledge proof for
any of such pair (cid:22)x, (cid:22)r.

VI. IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS
To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we
implemented a simple prototype, written in C/C++ and the
Crypto++ libraries [15]. We also implemented the generic
anonymous password authentication construction for exper-
iments, and the experimental results empirically conﬁrm that
conventional anonymous password authentication is indeed
not scalable. For both implementations, the client program
runs on a Fujitsu notebook, Intel Core2 Duo CPU, 2.53GHz,
OS Windows Vista, and the server program runs on a PC,
Intel Pentium D CUP, 3.00GHz, OS Windows XP. We next
report the implementation results.
A. Limited Scalability of Generic Construction
We have analyzed that the computational overhead upon
the server in conventional anonymous password authentica-
tion is linear with the total number of users. This will cause
scalability problem in large systems. To empirically deter-
mine how serious the problem is, we implement the generic
construction proposed in Section IV. While speciﬁc schemes
could be more efﬁcient than the generic construction, the
difference should not be drastic in principle.
In this implementation, we adopt the trivial PIR solution
in Step 3, such that the server simply sends to the user all
ej’s, together with AuthS; other steps remain unchanged.
We use 2048-bit Paillier homomorphic encryption (i.e.,
|n2| = 2048 bits), and h(.) is instantiated by SHA-1.
Figure 2 shows the experimental results with respect to
differen number of passwords contained in the server’s
password ﬁle.

VII. CONCLUSION
Anonymous password authentication enjoys the advan-
tages of password authentication while providing user pri-
vacy protection. However, anonymous password authentica-
tion in the standard setting has intrinsic weaknesses. To solve
these problems, we proposed a new approach for anonymous
password authentication, assuming a different setting where
users use password-protected credentials. We implemented a
prototype of the proposed scheme, which demonstrated very
good performance for real applications. There are issues un-
adressed in our scheme, e.g., user revocation. These will be
our future work.
Figure 2. Experimental Results on Generic Construction
Suppose that users can tolerate up to 30 seconds of
login latency,
the generic construction can only support
approximately 2000 users, according to Figure 2. The
experimental results conﬁrm that conventional anonymous
