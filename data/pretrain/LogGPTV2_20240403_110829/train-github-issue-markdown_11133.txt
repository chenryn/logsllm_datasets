    ============================================================
    Deno has panicked. This is a bug in Deno. Please report this
    at https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/new.
    If you can reliably reproduce this panic, include the
    reproduction steps and re-run with the RUST_BACKTRACE=1 env
    var set and include the backtrace in your report.

    [Info  - 1:25:24 PM] Connection to server got closed. Server will restart.
Full log here, though it's mostly the same on loop.
The error reccommends running the language server with RUST_BACKTRACE=1, but I
don't know how to do that from VsCode. I installed deno with `cargo install`.
`deno lsp` alone doesn't give me any error.
