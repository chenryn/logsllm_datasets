Question: In a scenario where an application requires fast transmission of data without the necessity of guaranteed delivery or strict ordering, which transport layer protocol would be more suitable and for what reason?
"A": "TCP, because it guarantees reliable, in-order packet delivery which is critical for fast data transmission.",
"B": "UDP, because it does not guarantee in-order packet delivery, making it faster for applications that do not require strict ordering.",
"C": "TCP, because it uses complex mechanisms to ensure speed is prioritized over reliability and order.",
"D": "UDP, because it operates without the overhead of ensuring reliability and order, therefore providing faster data transmission for such applications."
