User: I have python script that checks if the server is up or down, and if it's down it sends out an email along with few system logs. 
What I want is to keep checking for the server every 5 minutes, so I put the cronjob as follows:
*/5 * * * * /python/uptime.sh
So whenever the server's down, it sends an email. But I want the script to stop executing (sending more emails) after the first one. 
Can anyone help me out with how to do this? 
Thanks.
Assistant: write an empty While True script that runs forever (ex: "mailtrigger.py")
run it with -nohup mailtrigger.py from shell in infinite loop
once the server is down check if mailtrigger.py is running, if its
not then terminate mailtrigger.py (kill process id)

your next iterations will not send mails since mailtrigger.py is not running.
