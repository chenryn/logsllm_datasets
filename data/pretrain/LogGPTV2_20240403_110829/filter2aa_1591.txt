### The Current State of Active Directory Domain Privilege Escalation

"Defenders think in lists. Attackers think in graphs. As long as this is true, attackers win."
- John Lambert, GM, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center

#### AD Domain Privilege Escalation
- **Active Directory Ubiquity:** Active Directory is widely used, which means it receives significant attention and research funding.
- **Research and Tools:** This ubiquity has led to the development of various tools and techniques for privilege escalation.
- **Easy Targets:** Sometimes, we find "easy buttons" that simplify the process.

#### Derivative Local Admin
- **Definition:** "The chaining or linking of administrator rights through compromising other privileged accounts." - Justin Warner @sixdub
- **Example:**
  - Bob (Local Admin on PC1)
  - Mary (Local Admin on PC2)
  - Bob (Help Desk Admin)
  - Server Admins (Local Admin on PC2)

#### Challenges
- **Time-Consuming and Tedious:** Manually identifying and exploiting these chains can be very time-consuming.
- **Limited Situational Awareness:** Traditional methods often lack a comprehensive view of the network.
- **Necessity of DA:** It's important to question whether full Domain Admin (DA) access is even necessary for the desired actions.

### Graph Theory and Attack Graph Design

#### Basic Elements of a Graph
- **Vertices:** Represent individual elements of a system (e.g., users, groups, computers, domains).
- **Edges:** Represent relationships between vertices (e.g., group memberships, admin rights, user sessions, domain trusts).
- **Paths:** Sets of vertices and edges that connect non-adjacent vertices.

#### BloodHound Attack Graph Design
- **Vertices:** Users, groups, computers, and domains.
- **Edges:** Identify group memberships, admin rights, user sessions, and domain trusts.
- **Paths:** Always lead toward escalating rights.

### Stealthy Data Collection with PowerView

"PowerView is the best tool these days for understanding Windows networks…" - Phineas Phisher

#### PowerView
- **Description:** A pure PowerShell v2.0+ tool for domain and network situational awareness.
- **Features:**
  - Collects data that BloodHound uses.
  - Does not require elevated privileges for most collection methods.

#### Who’s Logged in Where?
- **Invoke-UserHunter:**
  - `Get-NetSession`: Sessions with a remote machine.
  - `Get-NetLoggedOn` / `Get-LoggedOnLocal`: Who is logged in on what machine.
- **Stealth Mode:**
  - Enumerate commonly trafficked servers and query remote sessions for each (user hunting).

#### Who Can Admin What?
- **Remote Group Enumeration:**
  - Use the WinNT service provider or `NetLocalGroupMembers()` to enumerate members of a local group on a remote machine without admin privileges.
- **PowerView:**
  - `Get-NetLocalGroup –ComputerName IP [-API]`

#### GPO Edition
- **GPOs and Local Administrators:**
  - GPOs can set local administrators.
  - GPOs are applied to OUs/Sites, allowing correlation of local admin information through communication with only a DC.
- **PowerView:**
  - `Find-GPOLocation`

#### Who’s in What Groups?
- **Group Membership:**
  - Enumerate all groups and pull the members of each.
- **PowerView:**
  - `Get-NetGroup | Get-NetGroupMember`

### Bringing It All Together

#### The BloodHound Ingestor
- **Get-BloodHoundData:** Automates gathering PowerView data for a domain.
- **Export-BloodHoundData:** Exports collected data to a neo4j batch REST API for ingestion.
- **Export-BloodHoundCSV:** Exports collected data to a series of CSVs for offline ingestion.

#### BloodHound
- **Built with:** Linkurious.js
- **Compiled with:** Electron
- **Database:** Uses a neo4j graph database
- **Data Feeding:** Fed by the custom PowerShell ingestor
- **Download:** bit.ly/GetBloodHound
