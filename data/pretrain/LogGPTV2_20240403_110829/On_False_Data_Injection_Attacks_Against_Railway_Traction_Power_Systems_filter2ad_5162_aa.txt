Abstract—Modern urban railways extensively use computer-
ized sensing and control technologies to achieve safe, reliable,
and well-timed operations. However, the use of these tech-
nologies may provide a convenient leverage to cyber-attackers
who have bypassed the air gaps and aim at causing safety
incidents and service disruptions. In this paper, we study false
data injection (FDI) attacks against railways’ traction power
systems (TPSes). Speciﬁcally, we analyze two types of FDI
attacks on the train-borne voltage, current, and position sensor
measurements – which we call efﬁciency attack and safety attack
– that (i) maximize the system’s total power consumption and
(ii) mislead trains’ local voltages to exceed given safety-critical
thresholds, respectively. To counteract, we develop a global
attack detection system that serializes a bad data detector and
a novel secondary attack detector designed based on unique
TPS characteristics. With intact position data of trains, our
detection system can effectively detect the FDI attacks on
trains’ voltage and current measurements even if the attacker
has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS, attack detection,
and real-time system state. Extensive simulations driven by
realistic running proﬁles of trains verify that a TPS setup is
vulnerable to the FDI attacks, but these attacks can be detected
effectively by the proposed global monitoring.
I. INTRODUCTION
In modern cities, safe, reliable, and well-timed operations
of urban railways are critical. A modern railway is a highly
complex cyber-physical system (CPS) consisting of diverse
subsystems including train motion control, traction power-
ing, signaling, and etc, where deeply embedded information
and communication technologies (ICTs) are used to operate
each train and connect trains to an operation center. The
extensive use of ICT may provide a convenient leverage
to attackers, however, who may aim to hurt passengers’
safety or cause widespread service disruptions. To date,
the cybersecurity of modern railways has relied on air
gaps that isolate their ICT systems from public networks.
However, recent high-proﬁle intrusions such as Stuxnet [1]
and Dragonﬂy [2] have successfully breached the air gaps of
critical CPS infrastructures and resulted in physical damage.
For instance, the Stuxnet worm damaged nuclear centrifuges
by injecting false control commands and forging normal
system states. Its design and architecture are not domain-
speciﬁc – they can be readily customized against other
CPSes including transportation [1]. Insider attacks represent
their severe

consequences have likewise been well documented [3]. It is
thus critical to understand the cybersecurity risks of modern
railways as a mission-critical CPS, and develop effective
security countermeasures in their ICT design.
In this paper, we study the cybersecurity of direct cur-
rent (dc) traction power systems (TPSes) that are widely
deployed in urban electrical railways. The criticality of
TPS is evidenced by prior severe incidents caused by TPS
malfunctions. The 2014 Moscow metro derailment that led
to 24 dead and 160 injured was caused by sudden braking
of the train in question, when its traction voltage dropped
abruptly [4]. In Singapore, a system-wide metro service
disruption, triggered by TPS faults, affected almost half a
million commuters during rush hours on July 7, 2015 [5].
Moreover, the computerized sensing and control in an auto-
mated TPS could be prime targets for cyber-attackers, who
can sabotage the control and steer the system into inefﬁcient
and unsafe states.
Motivated by Stuxnet-type attacks that forge physical sys-
tem states, in this paper, we study a general class of integrity
attacks called false data injection (FDI), which tampers with
train-borne sensor measurements required by TPS control.
In a TPS, the electricity power supplied by substations is
delivered by a network of overhead lines and third rails to
the trains. According to its operation mode, a train’s power
consumption can be highly dynamic. In traction mode, it
draws power from the TPS, causing a drop in the train’s
local voltage; in braking mode, it regenerates electricity from
kinetic energy and injects this electricity back to the TPS,1
causing a rise in the voltage. To prevent the voltage from
exceeding safety-critical thresholds, trains apply overcurrent
control and squeeze control [7] to throttle their power draw
and injection, respectively. As these controls are performed
based on train-borne voltage and current sensor measure-
ments, FDI attacks on the measurements may mislead the
train into erroneous power control decisions, which may
in turn produce damaging and even catastrophic physical
impacts on the train and the TPS. Recent results show
that the measurements can be compromised in practice by
precisely controlled electromagnetic interference in analog
sensors [8], hardware trojans in chips [9], and malware
infections in sensor ﬁrmwares [10]. Hence, FDI attack is

that generate electricity in deceleration [6].

a clear and present threat that requires immediate attention.
In this paper, we aim to answer the following two funda-
mental research questions:
(1) How to characterize the impact of FDI attacks on TPS
system’s efﬁciency and safety? Analysis of the impact based
on an essential TPS model will provide basic understanding
for developing countermeasures. However, the analysis is
difﬁcult, due to complex system dynamics arising from the
trains’ motion. In particular, a moving train does not only act
as “load” and “generation” alternately over time, but also al-
ters the power network’s topology and electrical parameters
continually. Moreover, because different TPS components
(trains, substations, and etc) become physically intercon-
nected through a common underlying power network, effects
of an erroneous power control on a train during attack may
propagate to the neighboring TPS components. The analysis
must address these intricate and unique characteristics of
TPSes.
(2) How to develop effective approaches for detecting
the FDI attacks? Our thesis is that, because measurements
from different trains are inherently correlated through in-
terconnection over the same power network, for attack
resilience we can apply a global detection that cross-checks
the measurements collected from all trains based on an a
priori global TPS model. However, in contrast to alternating
current (ac) power grids that have well-established central-
ized monitoring and sensor data cross-check safeguards for
reliable holistic control [11], [12], TPS is mainly concerned
with individual trains’ local operation (i.e., the overcurrent
and squeeze controls), and therefore it is not traditionally
subject to any global sensor data checks across trains. Thus,
an existing dc TPS operation center seldom scrutinizes the
sensor measurements, beyond their display and presentation
for human operators. In this paper, we demonstrate the
importance of these global, but hitherto ignored, sensor data
cross checks in the TPS domain against FDI attacks.
In answering the above two research questions, our main
contributions in this paper are as follows:
First, based on essential models of power substations,
power ﬂows, and train overcurrent and squeeze controls in
a TPS, we formulate two types of FDI attacks that we
call efﬁciency attack and safety attack. These attacks (i)
maximize the total instantaneous power consumption of the
TPS and (ii) mislead victim trains’ local voltages to exceed
given safety-critical thresholds, respectively. The efﬁciency
attack formulation models an aggressive attacker who aims
at maximizing the attack impact and provides insights into
understanding the performance degradation limit caused by
FDI attacks. Numerical results for a TPS section with two
substations and two trains show that the efﬁciency attack
can result in an instantaneous efﬁciency loss of about 20%,
whereas the safety attack on a single train can indeed lead
to signiﬁcant safety breaches. These results substantiate the
potency of FDI attacks on train-borne sensor measurements.
Second, we propose to apply a global bad data detection
(BDD) method, similar to that widely used in ac power grids
[12], to detect FDI attacks in a dc TPS. Despite a known
vulnerability of the BDD – it can be bypassed by an attacker
who knows enough details of its design – our numerical
results show that, in order for an FDI attack to be stealthy
against the BDD, it will have to settle for a signiﬁcantly
reduced damage on the system efﬁciency. Moreover, we
observe that, given intact position data of trains, solutions
of the BDD bypass condition will become discrete. Based
on this observation, we develop a novel secondary attack
detection (SAD) algorithm that can effectively detect the
onset of an FDI attack on trains’ voltage and current mea-
surements after it has bypassed the BDD. Hence, the BDD
and the SAD form in tandem a global attack detector under
the Kerckhoffs’s assumption (i.e., the attacker has full and
accurate knowledge of the system model, attack detection,
and real-time system state), provided that the integrity of
trains’ position information can be veriﬁed.
Third, we report extensive simulations, driven by realistic
proﬁles of trains in operation, to evaluate our solutions. For
a TPS with four trains each running over a distance of ten
kilometers for 800 seconds, our results show that, without
the global BDD, FDI attacks can increase the total system
energy consumption by 28.3% and breach the system’s
safety condition. After applying the BDD, the system’s total
energy consumption increases by no more than 6.2% under
the efﬁciency attack, and safety attacks become no longer
successful. Moreover, the proposed SAD algorithm achieves
a probability of 96% in detecting the onsets of the FDI
attacks that have successfully bypassed the BDD.
The balance of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II reviews related work. Section III describes our TPS
model. Section IV formulates the efﬁciency and safety
attacks. Section V analyzes the effectiveness of the BDD and
presents the proposed SAD algorithm. Section VI presents
simulation results. Section VII concludes.
II. RELATED WORK
Power ﬂow analysis and optimization for TPS have re-
ceived increasing research interest. Power ﬂow analysis is
a basic tool for TPS planning and operation. Prior work
has analyzed dc power ﬂows [13]–[15] and addressed the
interactions between the dc TPS and a supporting ac power
grid [16], [17]. We adopt existing electrical models for
different TPS components [13]–[15] in this work. These
models provide sufﬁcient accuracy generally [14], and they
are tractable for analysis. Based on power ﬂow analysis,
recent research has tried to improve the energy efﬁciency
of railways by leveraging trains’ power regeneration [18].
Techniques such as synchronizing the trains’ speed proﬁles
[19] and real-time substation voltage control [20] have been
shown to provide efﬁcient reuse of the regenerated power.
To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies

on TPS control have addressed it from a cybersecurity
perspective. The security problem is imperative, since TPS
is a form of critical infrastructure that renders it an attractive
target for attacks.
Different types of CPS can have vastly different proper-
ties and characteristics. Thus, their security concerns and
admissible detection strategies can be totally different. Typ-
ically, their cybersecurity analysis must be carried out in
a domain speciﬁc manner, with customized considerations
given to main details and semantics of speciﬁc systems.
Cybersecurity of various CPSes has been studied. C´ardenas
et al. [21] investigate the impacts of integrity and denial-of-
service attacks on a process control system of a chemical
reactor. Amin et al. [22] perform security threat assessment
of supervisory control and data acquisition systems for water
supply. Other efforts [12], [23] have analyzed FDI attacks
against ac utility power grids. They show that an attacker
capable of tampering with grid sensor measurements or
topology information can carefully construct attacks to by-
pass the detection by certain existing fault detectors. Recent
studies have investigated the impact of such stealthy attacks
on grid power ﬂows [11], [24]. They show that maliciously
biased estimates of the system state can cause grid operators
to make erroneous decisions that will lead to degraded per-
formance or even safety breaches. This paper is the ﬁrst to
analyze the efﬁciency and safety of TPS under FDI attacks.
We provide new and nontrivial domain speciﬁc modeling
and analysis to capture the targeted application’s unique
features and key properties. In particular, TPS involves real-
time and complex interactions between two highly dynamic
physical systems, namely a mechanical system of the trains’
motion and an electrical system that governs the trains’
power consumption and regeneration during this motion.
Attackers could exploit the interactions to strengthen their
attacks.
III. TRACTION POWER SYSTEM MODEL
In this section, we present a model of a dc TPS at a
certain time instant. The TPS is modeled as a power network
consisting of N nodes. Denote by N = {1, 2, . . . , N} the
set of nodes and L the set of resistive branches connecting
the nodes. The substations and the trains are connected to
different nodes. The sets of nodes for the substations, the
tractioning trains, and the regenerating trains are denoted
by Nsub, Ntra, and Nreg, respectively. We deﬁne Ntrains =
Ntra∪Nreg. The positions of the nodes 1, . . . , N are denoted
by a set s = {s1, s2, . . . , sN}, where s1 is zero and si is
the distance from node i to node 1. Fig. 1 illustrates a TPS
section with two substations at nodes 1 and 4, as well as
two trains at nodes 2 and 3. The train at node 2 is trac-
tioning and the train at node 3 is braking and regenerating.
Thus, N = {1, 2, 3, 4},L = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)},Nsub =
{1, 4},Ntra = {2},Nreg = {3}. The electrical models for

the power network, substations, and trains are described as
follows.
Power network: Let Vi and Ii denote the voltage and
current at node i, respectively, and v and i the vectors of the
nodal voltages and currents. For safe operations, all nodal
voltages must be within a safety limit, i.e.,

where V min
are the safety thresholds for node
i. By convention, we assume that the current injected into
the TPS is positive. The resistance of the branch connecting
the nodes i and j is denoted by Ri,j(s) and its conductance
by Gi,j(s), where Gi,j(s) = 1/Ri,j(s). Note that branch
resistance (and conductance) depends on the positions of
the trains, i.e., s. For instance, in Fig. 1, Ri,i+1 = γ(si+1 −
si), where γ is a constant depending on the electrical wire
characteristics. From Kirchhoff’s circuit laws, we have

Substations: We consider inverting substations capable of
both supplying and absorbing power. They are modeled as
dc voltage sources governed by
Vi = VNL − RsIi,
(3)
where VNL and Rs are the no-load voltage and the internal
resistance of the substation. When a substation supplies
power, Ii > 0; when it absorbs power, Ii < 0 and the
absorbed power is injected back to the supporting ac power
grid. This dc substation model has been widely adopted in
TPS analysis [14], [20].
Trains: Let Pi denote the power absorbed or injected by a
tractioning train or a regenerating train at node i. We have
Pi = ViIi.

For safety, the trains adopt the following two local power
controls [7].
