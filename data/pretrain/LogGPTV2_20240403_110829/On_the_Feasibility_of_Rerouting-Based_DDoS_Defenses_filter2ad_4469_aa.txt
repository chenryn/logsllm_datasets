Abstract—Large botnet-based ﬂooding attacks have recently
demonstrated unprecedented damage. However, the best-known
end-to-end availability guarantees against ﬂooding attacks re-
quire costly global-scale coordination among autonomous systems
(ASes). A recent proposal called routing around congestion (or
RAC) attempts to offer strong end-to-end availability to a selected
critical ﬂow by dynamically rerouting it to an uncongested detour
path without requiring any inter-AS coordination.
This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the (in)feasibility
of the RAC defense and points out that its rerouting approach,
though intriguing, cannot possibly solve the challenging ﬂooding
problem. An effective RAC solution should ﬁnd an inter-domain
detour path for its critical ﬂow with the two following desired
properties: (1) it guarantees the establishment of an arbitrary
detour path of its choice, and (2) it isolates the established detour
path from non-critical ﬂows so that the path is used exclusively
for its critical ﬂow. However, we show a fundamental trade-off
between the two desired properties, and as a result, only one of
them can be achieved but not both. Worse yet, we show that
failing to achieve either of the two properties makes the RAC
defense not just ineffective but nearly unusable. When the newly
established detour path is not isolated, a new adaptive adversary
can detect it in real time and immediately congest the path,
defeating the goals of the RAC defense. Conversely, when the
establishment of an arbitrary detour path is not guaranteed, more
than 80% of critical ﬂows we test have only a small number (e.g.,
three or less) of detour paths that can actually be established and
disjoint from each other, which signiﬁcantly restricts the available
options for the reliable RAC operation.
The ﬁrst lesson of this study is that BGP-based rerouting
solutions in the current inter-domain infrastructure seem to be
impractical due to implicit assumptions (e.g., the invisibility of
poisoning messages) that are unattainable in BGP’s current prac-
tice. Second, we learn that the analysis of protocol speciﬁcations
alone is insufﬁcient for the feasibility study of any new defense
proposal and, thus, additional rigorous security analysis and
various network evaluations,
including real-world testing, are
required. Finally, our ﬁndings in this paper agree well with the
conclusion of the major literature about end-to-end guarantees;
that is, strong end-to-end availability should be a security feature
of the Internet routing by design, not an ad hoc feature obtained
via exploiting current routing protocols.

INTRODUCTION
Botnet-driven Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) at-
tacks have been plaguing critical Internet services, ﬂooding
end hosts and services with volumetric attack trafﬁc. A more
sophisticated type of DDoS attack, called transit-link ﬂooding,
which targets the Internet’s core connectivity infrastructure,
has been recently discussed in academia [53], [32] and quickly
moved to real-world incidents [18], [27]. Transit-link ﬂooding
attacks utilize botnet to generate low-rate ﬂows between pairs
of bots [53] or toward public services [32] such that all of
these ﬂows cross a given set of network links, degrading the
connectivity for all services using these network links.
The best-known solution that offers strong service guaran-
tees to a selected critical ﬂow (e.g., a connection for mission-
critical infrastructure or premium users) under ﬂooding attacks
is bandwidth isolation mechanisms [30], [17]. They guar-
antee high bandwidth availability regardless of attack sizes
(e.g., botnet trafﬁc volume) by allocating dedicated end-to-
end bandwidth for critical ﬂows. However, all bandwidth
isolation proposals require global coordination between all the
autonomous systems (ASes) on the end-to-end path for band-
width reservation and ﬁltering. Considering the current highly
competitive inter-domain transit market, where no global-scale
ISP collaboration exists, deploying such bandwidth isolation
solutions seems challenging.
Recently, the “routing around congestion” (or RAC) de-
fense [51] has been proposed as an alternative solution against
server and transit-link ﬂooding attacks. The RAC defense
offers path isolation for any critical inbound ﬂow of a victim
network by dynamically creating a detour path exclusively for
the critical ﬂow. The beauty of the RAC defense is in its
immediate deployability in the current Internet without any
modiﬁcation of the Internet infrastructure because it only relies
on a well-known BGP inbound route-control mechanism [33]
that requires no coordination between ASes.
In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the
(in)feasibility of the RAC defense based on actual Inter-
net topology, business relationship, and public routing data.
Through our analysis, we point out that the rerouting approach,
though intriguing, cannot possibly solve the challenging ﬂood-
ing problem. We show a fundamental trade-off between two
highly desirable properties of the RAC defense. An effective
RAC defense should (1) guarantee the establishment of a
detour path of its choice so that it can reroute the selected
critical ﬂow when experiencing congestion, and (2) isolate
the obtained detour path from non-critical ﬂows so that it is
used only for the selected critical ﬂow. The discovered trade-
off between the two properties, unfortunately, shows that in
the current Internet, the RAC defense can achieve either the
isolated detour paths or the guaranteed establishment of detour
paths but not both. Achieving the instant, highly available
detour paths via the RAC defense, therefore, appears to be
infeasible.
Worse yet, we show that failing to achieve either of the
two properties makes the RAC defense not only less effective
but nearly unusable in practice. On one hand, we show that
the lack of complete path isolation signiﬁcantly limits the
bandwidth availability of the detour path because many non-
critical ﬂows end up sharing it with the critical ﬂow. Perhaps
more importantly,
the lack of path isolation also enables
a new adaptive attack, called a detour-learning attack, that
accurately identiﬁes every detour path establishment in real
time. After learning the newly established detour path, the

adaptive adversary can immediately congest the new detour
path by ﬂooding one of its transit links. Unfortunately, the
RAC defense cannot react to such adaptive ﬂooding attacks
quickly enough due to the undesirable long delays (e.g., 85
seconds even with a small size network of 1,000 ASes) in
switching to another detour path.
On the other hand, we show that when the establishment
of an arbitrary detour path is not guaranteed, it is extremely
challenging to operate the RAC defense reliably because the
majority (e.g., 80%) of critical ﬂows we test have only small
numbers (e.g.,
three or less) of disjoint detour paths that
can actually be established. Note that the fact that a detour
path can be established does not mean that it would have
enough bandwidth to serve the critical ﬂow; thus, the more
the establishable disjoint detour paths are available, the more
reliable RAC operation can be achieved.
The main goal of our paper is to draw some practical
conclusions about the very challenging server/link ﬂooding
problem. The analysis of the RAC proposal has led us to
learn some useful lessons. A crucial methodological lesson is
that, when analyzing the feasibility of a rerouting-based DDoS
defense proposal, it is not enough to evaluate the functional
feasibility of the proposal based on the protocol speciﬁcations.
Even if the speciﬁcation [49] allows BGP messages with exces-
sively long AS path within the theoretical limit (i.e., 2,034), the
actual network operation communities (e.g., NANOG) publicly
condemn the practice of broadcasting unnecessarily long (e.g.,
AS path longer than 75) BGP messages and strongly suggest
ﬁltering them [29], [38]. It is also well-known that certain
Cisco routers, by default, ﬁlter BGP messages with AS path
longer than 254 [46]. Therefore, the analysis of BGP-routing-
based DDoS proposals must be founded on thorough feasibility
checks with real-world feasibility tests, acceptance by network
operation communities, and various large-scale simulations.
Our work reconﬁrms the previous conclusion of multiple
independent projects [17], [31], [30], [26]; that is, defending
against transit-link ﬂooding attacks requires path or bandwidth
isolation that is achievable only through large-scale coordina-
tion among many ASes. We hope that our study will renew the
discussion of new, clean-slate Internet architectures that enable
such inter-domain coordination for highly available Internet
services.
Organization. We review the routing around congestion
(RAC) defense along with the summary of transit-link ﬂooding
attacks in Section II. We present two desired goals of the
RAC defense, namely, path isolation and guaranteed detour
establishment in Section III, and subsequently highlight the
fundamental trade-off between these two in Section IV. In
the consequence of lack of path
Section V, we highlight
isolation with a new metric called path leakage, and,
in
Section VI, we demonstrate a new adaptive attack that can
exploit even a small amount of path leakage to defeat the RAC
defense. In Section VII, we demonstrate how hard it is to ﬁnd
a detour path for the majority of critical ﬂows when the detour-
path establishment is not guaranteed. We also investigate the
required effort to make the RAC defense possible in the current
Internet in Section VIII. Finally, we conclude our paper in
Section IX.

II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
DDoS defenses have been extensively studied over the past
two decades [40], [58], [59], [45], [23], [35], [39]; refer to the
following articles [44], [60] for more comprehensive surveys.
A. Transit-Link Flooding Attacks
In last few years, transit-link ﬂooding DDoS attacks have
been proposed and demonstrated substantial damage to the
core of the Internet (e.g., backbone links in large ISPs or
inter-ISP links) [53], [32]. Transit-link ﬂooding attacks have
been further studied to achieve more efﬁcient botnet resource
usage [48] or distributed botnet coordination [34].
Figure 1 shows how a transit-link ﬂooding attack creates
a large number of attack ﬂows and congests a targeted transit
link. The adversary controls her bots to send trafﬁc through the
link (W –Z), making all other ﬂows crossing the targeted link
experience congestion. The critical ﬂow (see the blue dashed
lines in Figure 1) from the critical AS C (i.e., the source
of the critical trafﬁc) to the destination AS D also traverses
the congested link. This is in sharp contrast to traditional
server-ﬂooding attacks that aim to choke the resources (e.g.,
computation, memory, or access link bandwidth) of the end
target (e.g., the destination AS D in Figure 1).
Transit-link ﬂooding attacks have two speciﬁc character-
istics that make them exceedingly effective at scale while
rendering traditional defense mechanisms irrelevant. First, they
attack targets indirectly. As the locus of attack is different from
the targeted end servers, they cannot be easily detected by
intrusion-detection systems and ﬁrewalls at the end servers.
Second, these attacks use protocol-conforming trafﬁc ﬂows
that are indistinguishable from legitimate ﬂows, thereby caus-
ing high collateral damage when ﬂows are simply dropped to
relieve congestion.
End-to-end bandwidth guarantee. A line of research that
aims to achieve strong availability guarantees against transit-
link ﬂooding attacks have offered the bandwidth isolation
mechanism. These proposals isolate attack trafﬁc by the end-
to-end bandwidth reservation and enforcement, thereby provid-
ing guaranteed bandwidth for critical ﬂows; e.g., STRIDE [30],
SIBRA [17]. A critical ﬂow can be protected by SIBRA and its
share of guaranteed bandwidth does not diminish even when
the number of bots outside the critical and destination ASes
increases.
Other partial solutions. Several defense mechanisms have
been proposed to partially mitigate the link-ﬂooding prob-
lem. SPIFFY [31] is a single-domain ﬂow-testing solution
