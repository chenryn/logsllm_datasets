## Abstract
Recent large-scale botnet-based flooding attacks have caused unprecedented damage. The most effective end-to-end availability guarantees against such attacks require costly global-scale coordination among autonomous systems (ASes). A recent proposal, called "Routing Around Congestion" (RAC), aims to provide strong end-to-end availability for critical flows by dynamically rerouting them to uncongested paths without requiring inter-AS coordination.

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the feasibility of the RAC defense. We demonstrate that while the RAC approach is intriguing, it cannot effectively solve the flooding problem. An effective RAC solution should meet two key properties: (1) it must guarantee the establishment of a chosen detour path, and (2) it must isolate the established detour path from non-critical flows to ensure exclusive use for the critical flow. However, we show a fundamental trade-off between these properties, where achieving one compromises the other. Failing to achieve either property renders the RAC defense ineffective or nearly unusable.

Our findings highlight that BGP-based rerouting solutions in the current inter-domain infrastructure are impractical due to unattainable assumptions. Additionally, protocol specification analysis alone is insufficient for evaluating new defense proposals; rigorous security analysis and real-world testing are essential. Our study aligns with the conclusion that strong end-to-end availability should be a designed security feature of Internet routing, not an ad hoc feature obtained by exploiting current protocols.

## 1. Introduction
Botnet-driven Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have been a significant threat to critical Internet services, flooding end hosts and services with volumetric attack traffic. A more sophisticated type of DDoS attack, known as transit-link flooding, targets the core connectivity infrastructure of the Internet. This type of attack has been discussed in academia and has quickly moved to real-world incidents.

The best-known solution for providing strong service guarantees to critical flows under flooding attacks is bandwidth isolation mechanisms, which allocate dedicated end-to-end bandwidth. However, these solutions require global coordination among ASes, which is challenging in the current competitive inter-domain transit market.

Recently, the "Routing Around Congestion" (RAC) defense has been proposed as an alternative. RAC offers path isolation for critical inbound flows by dynamically creating detour paths. The appeal of RAC lies in its immediate deployability in the current Internet without modifying the infrastructure, as it relies on well-known BGP inbound route-control mechanisms.

In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the feasibility of the RAC defense using actual Internet topology, business relationships, and public routing data. We show a fundamental trade-off between two desirable properties of RAC: guaranteed establishment of a detour path and isolation of the detour path from non-critical flows. Achieving both properties simultaneously is infeasible in the current Internet, making the RAC defense less effective or nearly unusable.

We also demonstrate that failing to achieve either property significantly impacts the RAC defense. For instance, the lack of path isolation can enable a new adaptive attack, called a detour-learning attack, which can detect and congest the newly established detour path. Conversely, if the establishment of an arbitrary detour path is not guaranteed, the number of available disjoint detour paths for critical flows is limited, reducing the reliability of RAC.

Our work emphasizes the importance of thorough feasibility checks, including real-world testing and acceptance by network operation communities, for evaluating BGP-routing-based DDoS proposals. We conclude that defending against transit-link flooding attacks requires path or bandwidth isolation, achievable only through large-scale coordination among ASes. This reaffirms the need for new, clean-slate Internet architectures that enable such inter-domain coordination for highly available Internet services.

## 2. Background and Related Work
DDoS defenses have been extensively studied over the past two decades. Transit-link flooding DDoS attacks, which target the core of the Internet, have been particularly damaging. These attacks are characterized by their indirect nature and the use of protocol-conforming traffic, making them difficult to detect and mitigate.

### 2.1 Transit-Link Flooding Attacks
Transit-link flooding attacks create a large number of attack flows to congest targeted links, affecting all other flows crossing those links. This is different from traditional server-flooding attacks, which aim to choke the resources of the end target. Transit-link flooding attacks are effective at scale and render traditional defense mechanisms irrelevant.

### 2.2 End-to-End Bandwidth Guarantee
Research aimed at providing strong availability guarantees against transit-link flooding attacks has proposed bandwidth isolation mechanisms, such as STRIDE and SIBRA. These mechanisms reserve and enforce end-to-end bandwidth, ensuring guaranteed bandwidth for critical flows even when the number of bots increases.

### 2.3 Other Partial Solutions
Several partial solutions have been proposed to mitigate link-flooding problems. SPIFFY, NetHide, CoDef, LinkScope, and RADAR are examples of such solutions, each addressing different aspects of the problem.

## 3. Desired Goals of the RAC Defense
An effective RAC defense should meet two key goals:
1. **Guaranteed Establishment of Detour Paths**: The RAC defense should ensure that a chosen detour path can be established when needed.
2. **Isolation of Detour Paths**: The established detour path should be isolated from non-critical flows to ensure it is used exclusively for the critical flow.

## 4. Fundamental Trade-Off Between Properties
We show a fundamental trade-off between the two desired properties of the RAC defense. In the current Internet, it is infeasible to achieve both properties simultaneously. Achieving one property often compromises the other, making the RAC defense less effective or nearly unusable.

## 5. Lack of Path Isolation and Path Leakage
The lack of path isolation leads to a new metric called path leakage, which measures the extent to which non-critical flows share the detour path. High path leakage can enable a new adaptive attack, called a detour-learning attack, which can detect and congest the newly established detour path.

---

## 6. Adaptive Attack Exploiting Path Leakage
We demonstrate a new adaptive attack that exploits even a small amount of path leakage to defeat the RAC defense. This attack can accurately identify and congest the newly established detour path, rendering the RAC defense ineffective.

---

## 7. Difficulty in Finding Detour Paths
When the establishment of an arbitrary detour path is not guaranteed, it is extremely challenging to operate the RAC defense reliably. Our tests show that the majority of critical flows have only a small number of disjoint detour paths that can actually be established, limiting the reliability of the RAC defense.

## 8. Making RAC Defense Possible in the Current Internet
We investigate the required effort to make the RAC defense possible in the current Internet. This includes thorough feasibility checks, real-world testing, and acceptance by network operation communities.

---

## 9. Conclusion
Our study highlights the challenges and limitations of the RAC defense in the current Internet. We emphasize the need for new, clean-slate Internet architectures that enable large-scale coordination among ASes for highly available Internet services. Future work should focus on developing and deploying such architectures to address the growing threat of transit-link flooding attacks.
