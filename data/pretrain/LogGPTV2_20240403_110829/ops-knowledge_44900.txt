User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: I had a simpler solution. Using @apple way but rename main.py to pip.py then put it in your python version scripts folder and add scripts folder to your path access it globally. if you don't want to add it to path you have to cd to scripts and then run pip command.
