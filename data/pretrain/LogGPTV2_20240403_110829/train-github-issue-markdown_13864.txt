Similar to `atom.commands.onWillDispatch` and `atom.commands.onDidDispatch`.
This would be useful for extensions wanting to perform some action before or
after a command is performed.
Being able to determine the source of the event would be useful in such an API
(mouse vs keyboard vs command palette).
