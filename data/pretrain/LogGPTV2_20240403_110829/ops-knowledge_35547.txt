Assistant: This log chunk shows the DisplayPowerController process (PID 1702) animating the brightness to a target of 38 at a rate of 200. The ActivityManager process (PID 1702) is also mentioned, with a caller (10113 and 10111) not holding REAL_GET_TASKS. The AudioManager process (PID 23650) is also mentioned, with the log content "isMusicActive...".
