Hi,
when I start my `Flask` app via `python3 -m flask run` and there is an error
in my code, `Flask` only returns with the following message:
    Usage: python -m flask run [OPTIONS]
    Error: The file/path provided (server2.run) does not appear to exist.  Please verify the path is correct.  If app is not on PYTHONPATH, ensure the extension is .py
Is there a way to get proper error stack messages or am I not seeing the
obvious.. ðŸ¤”
