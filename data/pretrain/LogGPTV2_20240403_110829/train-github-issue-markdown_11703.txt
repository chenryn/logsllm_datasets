Hello,

I am encountering an issue when attempting to insert data from a DataFrame into a SQL Server using the following code:

```python
engine = create_engine('mssql+pyodbc://localhost/...')
# ...
df.to_sql(name='data', con=engine, if_exists='append', index=False)
```

This code works successfully with version 0.21.1 and earlier versions of the library. However, with version 0.23, I receive the following error:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (pyodbc.ProgrammingError)
('42000', '[42000] [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]
The incoming request has too many parameters.
The server supports a maximum of 2100 parameters.
Reduce the number of parameters and resend the request.
```

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you.
