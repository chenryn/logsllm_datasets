Jan.-Mar. 2005
The Official Quarterly Newsletter of AIS Special Interest Group on Semantic Web and Information Systems AIS SIGSEMIS  2005
Dear friends,
One year now AIS SIGSEMIS has become a reference point for the Semantic Web and it
serves the Information Systems, the Computers Science and the Semantic Web
Community.
During the last year your continuous support was the key motive to provide a number of
dissemination channels concerning Semantic Web and Information Systems:
1. We started the Bulletin Edition, (this is the fourth issue) with an established rate of 5500 average
downloads per issue.
2. We designed and launched the International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (EIC
Prof. Amit Sheth), it IDEA Group Publishing (http://www.idea-group.com/journals/details.asp?id=4625). Already two
issues have been published and the 3rd issue is in production. I think this is a great addition to your
journals portfolios. Feel free to recommend it to your library from http://www.idea-
group.com/recommend.asp?ID=4625
3. We undertook a number of Special Issues in well-known international journals aiming at a multilevel
awareness campaign on semantic web. In this issue we provide the table of contents of the Special
Issue on Digital Libraries in the Knowledge Era: Knowledge Management and Semantic Web Technology that
was recently finalized at the Library Management Journal of Emerald (EIC Steve O’Connor).
Additionally in this issue you can find three AIS SIGSEMIS sponsored special issues:
a. IJ on Semantic Web and Information Systems, Special Issue on "Semantic Web and Healthcare
Information Systems Interoperability", Guest Editors: Vipul Kashyap, Asuman Dogac
b. British Journal on Educational Technology, Special Issue on “Advances of Semantic Web for E-
learning: Expanding learning frontiers”, Guest Editors: Ambjorn Naeve, Miltiadis Lytras,
Wolfrang Nejdl, Joseph Harding, Nicolas Balacheff.
c. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, Special Issue on “Knowledge and Data
Engineering in the Semantic Web Era”, Guest Editors: Gottfried Vossen, Miltiadis Lytras, Nick
Koudas
d. Electronic Government: An international Journal, Special Issue on “Exploiting Knowledge
Management for Ubiquitous E-Government in the Semantic Web Era”, Guest Editors: Miltiadis
Lytras, Lakhsmi Iyer, Athanassios Tsakalidis
4. We support and sponsor a number of Tracks in IS conferences as well as workshops:
a. ECIS Track on Semantic Web and Information Systems:
http://www.ecis2005.de/semantic.html
b. AMCIS Track on Semantic E-Business

5. We co-organize the MSR'05:First on-Line conference on Metadata and Semantics Research:
Approaches to Advanced Information Systems. Consider it as a key event for your SW planned
publications. Find more info at http://www.metadata-semantics.org/
6. Our membership has increased. We have 75 officially registered members and a GREAT thank you
belongs to all of you.
In the recent disaster of Tsunami in SE Asia we decided from the limited reserves of our SIGSEMIS to donate
270$ in the American Redcross International Disaster Fund. A great thank you to all the AIS SIGSEMIS Board
members who supported this decision. Our souls and hearts are close to the people in SE Asia.
In this issue we have the honor to host two excellent interviews. Professor William R. King (the Founding
President of Association for Information Systems as well as professor Richard Watson, President of AIS
provide me two excellent interviews. I encourage you read them. I would like to thanks them and to wish
from the bottom of my heart all the best to them.
In this issue there are several interesting pieces of news:
• A n excellent article by Amit Sheth, Director of LSDIS, University of Georgia, Co-Founder and CTO of
Semagix, and EIC of IJSWIS on “ Why are we still pushing the Semantic Web? ”
• An interesting article by Jorge Cardoso, on Semantic Web Services: Progress in 2004 and trends for 2005
• An update on our IJ on Semantic Web and Information Systems
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin Vol. 1 No. 3, October 2004, page 4
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
• News from AIS SIGSEMIS activities (Call for papers in special issues, sponsored minitracks and
workshops)
• Two research articles
• Our regular columns and a brand new column that will be of interest for many of you. I would like to
thank our new columnist Heiner Stuckenschmidt, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, that will be the columnist of
“RDF Technologies – Foundations, Applications and Developments”regular column.
• A special section related to the EU call for Semantic Web Knowledge Systems that is open. I think it is
interesting for all of our readers around the worlds to check the priorities of the European Union to this topic.
I invite you to join our SIG and be part of an exciting community:
(http://www.sigsemis.org/sig/membership/document_view ). In your renewal of AIS subscription consider
SIGSEMIS as an interesting option.
Looking forward for your comments, ideas, participation and inquiries. AIS SIGSEMIS is not a close club. It is
an open forum. Be part of this exciting community.
Semantic Web technology is here to stay. Looking forward to "see" you in one of the forthcoming AIS
SIGSEMIS activities.

“ Why are we still pushing the Semantic Web? ”
Amit Sheth
Director, LSDIS Lab at the University of Georgia; CTO/Co-founder, Semagix, Inc.
Why are we still pushing the Semantic Web?
This was the question a panelist asked at the W3C Advisory Committee meeting that I attending at the
beginning of December 2004. In other words, the panelist and others discussing this question were
wondering, why is it taking so long for the industry to get it (its importance)? Or that, by now, we would
have expected it to have seen much wider adoption, a clear indication that the Semantic Web is here for good,
transforming the Web into its next logical incarnation.
I had a chance to respond to the question. The essence of my comment was that the progress is quite robust
and pervasive, and there are prominent signs that the Semantic Web is not just a fad, that this time, semantics
as applied to information (which predates the Semantic Web as defined today) is indeed likely to have deep
impact on businesses as well as common Web user in less than 5 years time frame. Here is a perspective on
the adoption of the Semantic Web, which also incorporates the discussions we had at the dinner involving
some of the Semantic Web technology/product vendors who are members of the W3C (such as Semagix) and
the W3C Semantic Web team members (Eric Miller and others).
Research: Although funding from NSF, DARPA and other US research funding agencies have waned, DAML
program gave excellent and timely impetus to the Semantic Web research in the US. Follow on to Guha’s MCF
work had already primed work on RDF. The funding advantage moved with Europe with Framework V, and
is firmly entrenched with Framework VI. The number of new conferences and the attendance at these
conferences, sessions related to the Semantic Web in older and more established conferences, number of
published papers and new scientific journals devoted to the Semantic Web (such as Web Semantics, Applied
Ontology and Semantic Web & Information Systems) all point to broad and increasingly entrenched interest in
this new area.
Standards: An important thing that has benefited our area is timely standards activity. It is helpful to have
basic standards before the area matures and before industry interest peaks, reducing the chances of clashes
between the entrenched interests. Not having activities being taken to competing standards bodies, as is the
case in Web Services area, helps too.
Technology and Products: One of the most exciting things to have happened in our area is the number of
technologies commercialized from academic research (Taalee’s MediaAnywhere A/V Semantic Search and
Semagix’s Freedom from University of Georgia’s SCORE technology, Network Inference’s relationship with
University of Manchester, Ontoprise’s relationship with Karlshrue, to name a few). Now, at least twenty
vendors claim to use or support Semantic Web technologies, and the list is growing quite rapidly. And
perhaps most importantly, scientific and business communities are building targeted (i.e., with clear purpose)
and large ontologies at an impressive pace.
Industry Recognition: I just returned from W3C 10th anniversary celebrations
(http://www.w3.org/2004/09/W3C10-Program.html) and the follow on W3C Advisory Committee
meetings. The panel on the "Web of Meaning" helped showed how the thought leaders and industry
executives buy into the vision of the Semantic Web. Panelists Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media, talk) talked about
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin Vol. 1 No. 3, October 2004, page 6
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
the emergence of new industry leaders and the architectural context where the Semantic Web technologies has
an important play. Bill Ruh (Cisco Systems, talk) presented a fairly encouraging perspective on applications of
the Semantic Web technologies for important and growing business application areas such as Regulatory
Compliance, B2B Exchange, Workflow and BPM, and Business Intelligence. What is interesting is that some of
these are “selling aspirin” rather than “selling vitamins”, something that does better in low to moderate
economic growth environments.
At the industry events, such as those organized by TopQuadrant and MITRE, or the user group initiated
events, such as those for US’s Department of Defense or the Life Science Community, 100 to 300+ people have
shown up, which indicated fairly high level of industry and user group interest.
Industry Deployment and Early Successes: Since some very early deployment examples that were discussed
at the WWW2004 Developer’s day, there are now increasing number of examples of deployments both in
Enterprises (e.g., see my KMWorld talk) or for more “common” web users. It is this topic what garnered the
main attention during our dinner discussions (mentioned above). One exciting observation that came up is
the stealth inclusion of the Semantic Web technologies in applications. Eric Miller gave the example of
Creative Common’s used of RDF (also see Shelly Parker’s earlier article). This is an example of simpler SW
applications involving embedding license metadata and validating it in the definition of Creative Common's
license terms so millions of content items would in essence be using at least limited Semantic Web technology
for enforcing licenses! Another example is that of semantic annotation of syndicated contents and Web
Services (e.g., the WSDL-S semantic proposal/tool for annotation of Web Services). Such applications can
quickly lead to a wide spread and pervasive use of RDF in a fairly short time. What is interesting is that some
of the applications are not being deployed by early adoptors; instead the SW technologies have been part of
the pain killer types of main-stream IT applications and solutions (such as Anti-Money Laundering,
compliance and risk management)!
One perspective that some in the community, particularly Tim Berners-Lee, seem to promote it that Semantic
Web is “not interesting in the smaller scale”. As more and more things connected by a “semantic way” it
becomes more and more important. This makes sense from the perspective of global scale Web and non-
enterprise applications. But from industry perspective, I believe Semantic Web is equally interesting at the
intra- and inter-Enterprise scales, and for Enterprise applications. This view is the same as the adoption and
importance of Web technologies in Intranets. If at all, given the ability to constrain or limit the domain, deeper
domain semantics can be put to use, agreements to build ontologies can be reached faster, industry specific
metadata standards can be readily used, and facts and knowledge to populate ontologies can be obtained
more easily. Today’s enterprises have millions of documents, and access to massive amounts o high-quality
or targeted syndicated contents and data (e.g., through Lexis-Nexis, ChoicePoint, NewsML and RSS News
Feeds, and so on). The ontologies developed to support targeted enterprise scale Semantic Applications are
