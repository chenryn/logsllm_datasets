### Elasticsearch Version
Amazon Elasticsearch 2.3.2

### Problem Description
When attempting to insert the same field into the same index with a different mapping, a new mapping is not created. However, changing the field name results in the creation of a new mapping. This issue appears to be a duplicate of previously closed issues #16348, #15138, and #15568.

### Expected vs. Actual Behavior
- **Expected Behavior**: When inserting a field with a different format, a new mapping should be created to accommodate the new data type.
- **Actual Behavior**: A new mapping is not created for the same field with a different format. However, if the field name is changed, a new mapping is created.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Insert a document with a `timestamp` field in one format:
   ```sh
   $ curl -XPOST -d '{"timestamp": "2016/08/18 12:55:43"}' https://aws-elasticsearch/logstash-2016.08.18/test_map1
   {"_index":"logstash-2016.08.18","_type":"test_map1","_id":"AVadvLddEO70PGmPaHHU","_version":1,"_shards":{"total":2,"successful":1,"failed":0},"created":true}
   ```

2. Attempt to insert a document with the same `timestamp` field but in a different format:
   ```sh
   $ curl -XPOST -d '{"timestamp": "2016-08-18T12:42:06.623000+0000"}' https://aws-elasticsearch/logstash-2016.08.18/test_map2
   {"error":{"root_cause":[{"type":"mapper_parsing_exception","reason":"failed to parse [timestamp]"}],"type":"mapper_parsing_exception","reason":"failed to parse [timestamp]","caused_by":{"type":"illegal_argument_exception","reason":"Invalid format: \"2016-08-18T12:42:06.623000+0000\" is malformed at \"-08-18T12:42:06.623000+0000\""}},"status":400}
   ```

3. Change the field name and insert the document with the new field name:
   ```sh
   $ curl -XPOST -d '{"new_timestamp": "2016-08-18T12:42:06.623000+0000"}' https://aws-elasticsearch/logstash-2016.08.18/test_map2
   {"_index":"logstash-2016.08.18","_type":"test_map2","_id":"AVadx4_NEO70PGmPaHHc","_version":1,"_shards":{"total":2,"successful":1,"failed":0},"created":true}
   ```

### Summary
- The same field with a different format does not create a new mapping.
- Changing the field name creates a new mapping.
- This behavior is inconsistent and may be related to previously closed issues #16348, #15138, and #15568.
