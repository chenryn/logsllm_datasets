### Analysis of Overcharged Volume and Source Rates in Tests

Figure 14 illustrates the relationship between overcharged volume and different source rates during a five-minute Skype spam attack. The charging volume increases proportionally with the source rates, suggesting that operators do not enforce any security mechanisms for UDP-based services. This lack of security allows the spam volume to grow significantly.

An interesting observation is that, in Operator-I, even if the packets are not delivered to the User Equipment (UE) due to a weak radio link, they are still charged by the operator. This indicates that the operator charges based on the volume of data that arrives at their network, rather than the volume successfully delivered to the UE. Figure 15 further supports this by showing that the overcharge volume grows proportionally with the spam duration, reaching over 500 MB after 24 hours in our experiments.

Additionally, the attack continues even after the victim signs out from Skype. Wireshark traces (Figure 16) show that spam packets continue to arrive at the UE and are charged by the operator, even though the UE has closed the application port, as indicated by ICMP Port Unreachable messages.

### Similar Attacks via Other Services

Similar attacks can be launched using Google Talk. The attacker initiates a call before the victim accepts it, trapping the mobile user. The performance is similar to the Skype attack, but we omit the details due to space constraints. Both the 3G charging system's vulnerability and the implementation of Skype/GTalk contribute to this issue. The root cause is the absence of a feedback mechanism in the 3G charging system to block suspicious or malicious flows. VoIP implementations that release access information without explicit user confirmation are exploited to mount these attacks.

### Spam Attack in Video Streaming

Other channels, such as video streaming, can also be used to launch stealth spam attacks. For example, an attacker can create a malicious link to redirect web browsing operations to start real-time video streaming. When the victim clicks on a phishing link, it redirects the browser to:
```
rtsp://*.*.1.204:554/trackID=5
```
where RTSP is a network protocol for video streaming. Once the link is clicked, the victim starts a new RTSP session on port 554, releasing confidential access information to the attacker. The attacker then sends spam packets. Our tests show that this attack performs similarly to the Skype spam attack, both running over UDP. We omit the detailed results due to space constraints.

### Summary of Stealthy Spam Attacks

In summary, stealthy spam attacks pose a real threat to mobile users, rooted in the inherent loopholes in the current charging architecture. Unless these loopholes are fixed, mobile users may always be vulnerable to such attacks. However, there is currently no strong incentive for attackers to launch these attacks, as they do not gain immediate benefits. Nonetheless, future incentives could lead to more sophisticated attacks.

### Remedies for Architectural Weaknesses

The fundamental problem is the lack of a feedback mechanism from the UE to the carrierâ€™s charging system. This design limitation in the current 3G/4G charging system makes it easy for anyone to send data to the UE without prior consent. A viable charging system should include:

1. **User Awareness and Precaution**: Mobile users must be aware of potential attacks and apply precautionary measures, such as limiting the size of automatically downloaded data.
2. **Detection and Feedback**: The UE must be able to detect unwanted traffic and send feedback. Current protocols at the network and transport layers support this, but many applications ignore unwanted data. This needs to be addressed.
3. **Carrier Response**: Carriers must take feedback from the UE to stop unwanted traffic.

We propose three solution options: implicit-block, explicit-allow, and explicit-stop.

- **Implicit-Block**: Enforce CN components like GGSN and NAT boxes to use implicit hints from the UE to block unwanted traffic. Messages like TCP-RESET and ICMP Port Unreachable can serve as hints.
- **Explicit-Allow**: The UE explicitly specifies anticipated packets by modifying Packet Filters of Traffic Flow Template (TFT) associated with its PDP context.
- **Explicit-Stop**: Provide explicit feedback from the UE to the carrier when closing data services. This solution is flexible and allows the UE to stop data charging at any time.

### Related Work

Security analysis of mobile devices has been an active research area, focusing on various types of malware, DoS attacks, and privacy intrusion. Despite these efforts, the security assessment of the 3G/4G accounting system remains largely unaddressed. Our work provides the first experimental study assessing the vulnerability and practical attacks on the 3G/4G accounting system, exposing limitations in its charging architecture and policy practices.

### Conclusion

The trend towards wireless and mobile internet, driven by the growth of smartphones and 3G/4G infrastructure, has led to usage-based charging. The 3G/4G standards provide flexibility for carriers to define their own charging policies, but this also introduces vulnerabilities. Our experiments on operational 3G networks have revealed these loopholes and demonstrated simple attacks.

Our study highlights the need for proper validation and verification of traffic types and content, especially in differential charging. A dependable, usage-based charging system requires coordinated improvements in the network, mobile device, and applications. Users must be aware of threats and apply precautions, while the UE and operators must implement feedback mechanisms to block unwanted traffic.
