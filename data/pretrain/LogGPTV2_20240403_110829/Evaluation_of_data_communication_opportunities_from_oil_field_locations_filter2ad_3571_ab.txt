### 4. Measurement Results

#### 4.1 Phase 1 Study

**Data Collection and Recording:**
In the Phase 1 study, data was initially recorded manually during site visits. After deploying measurement units to field crews, data was automatically logged in a local database on laptops. We developed scripts to extract essential information from these records, which were then uploaded to an FTP server periodically. Logs from both phases were used for the subsequent analysis.

**Field Visits and Coverage:**
From March 31, 2010, to April 9, 2010, we visited 12 field locations spread over an area of more than 35,000 kmÂ² (see Figure 2a). The selection of these locations was based on operational scheduling and business concerns, rather than geographical or service coverage considerations.

**Cellular Link Performance:**
Table 1 summarizes the field test results for cellular links. AT&T provided EDGE service at all locations but had no high-speed 3G coverage. In contrast, Verizon offered 3G EVDO service at nine locations and no service at the remaining three. This resulted in significant differences in average upload and download speeds between the two providers.

| Provider | Coverage (%) | Bandwidth (kbps) |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **AT&T** | 100          | 75               |
| **Verizon** | 75         | 0                |
| **Upload** | 94           | 323              |
| **Download** | 106        | 645              |

**Coverage Map Accuracy:**
During our tests, we found that while service provider coverage maps can be useful, they do not always match actual measurements. For example, when we overlaid Verizon's coverage map (from [22]) on our field test map, we observed that two of the three locations without Verizon service were indeed in uncovered areas. The third location, which should have had service, did not, likely due to its unfavorable topography (surrounded by higher ground).

**TCP Throughput Monitoring:**
We also monitored TCP throughput during a 3-hour drive from point A (not one of the field locations) to a nearby city, point D. During this trip, 600 MB of data was continuously uploaded. The TCP throughput over time, as shown in Figure 2b, generally aligned with the coverage along the route, with some discrepancies.

**Signal Strength and Data Speeds:**
Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between download/upload speeds and signal strength readings from data modems. Linear fittings suggest that a 1-dB increase in signal strength can result in a 28.4 kbps increase in download speed and a 7 kbps increase in upload speed with one antenna. Using two antennas increased the average signal strength by 1 dB, leading to a 15% increase in download speed. However, upload speeds were not significantly affected. The spatial diversity provided by two antennas, even though only a few meters apart, improved link speed in our field tests but could not make 3G data service available where a single antenna setup failed.

**Conclusion of Phase 1:**
Based on these findings, we decided to use a Verizon data modem with a two-antenna setup as the standard 3G data link for further studies.

#### 4.2 Phase 2 Study

**Data Collection and Crews:**
In Phase 2, we collected measurement results from four crews stationed in Shreveport, Louisiana (SLA1 to SLA4), and one crew in Williston, North Dakota (WIL1). Each crew typically operates within an area of thousands of square kilometers around their base city. SLA1, the pilot crew, finalized the hardware and software configuration from November 2010 to March 2011 using AT&T's cellular link. In March 2011, we switched SLA1 to Verizon service, aligning it with the other crews.

**Availability Analysis:**
The availability of data links was analyzed based on the work shift patterns of each crew. For example, SLA2, a day crew, stops operation and shuts down equipment at night, while SLA1 and SLA4 are 24-hour crews. All crews move to new locations after 5 to 10 days, with transitions taking 1 to 3 days, during which equipment is powered off.

**Log Processing:**
We retrieved Windows OS native logs containing PC power on/off events to reprocess availability logs for cellular and satellite interfaces. This allowed us to calculate link availability only when the equipment was powered on, eliminating the impact of job transitions and equipment downtime.

**Cost and Conditional Probability:**
Given the cost difference between satellite (USD 5/MB) and cellular (USD 100/month with 2 GB cap), we calculated the probability \( P(X) \) that a link \( X \) is available and the conditional probability \( P(X|Y) \) that link \( X \) is available given link \( Y \) is available. Higher values of \( P(X|Y) \) indicate more opportunities to use link \( X \) instead of \( Y \).

**Availability Comparison:**
Table 2 shows the availability analysis for SLA1 to SLA4 in April and May 2011. Cellular data links showed high availability comparable to BGAN, while VSAT was less reliable due to issues with its bulky directional antenna.

| Crew | P(B) | P(V) | P(C) | P(C|B) | P(C|V) |
|------|------|------|------|--------|--------|
| SLA1 | 98.50% | 71.29% | 66.42% | 98.99% | 98.99% |
| SLA2 | 97.03% | 83.95% | 52.86% | 99.52% | 99.48% |
| SLA3 | 93.76% | 88.15% | 56.99% | 98.12% | 97.78% |
| SLA4 | 89.73% | 88.90% | 44.79% | 91.89% | 99.28% |

**Link Availability Over Time:**
Figures 4 and 5 show the availability of cellular, BGAN, and VSAT links over time. Regular interruptions, lasting hours or even days, were observed. These interruptions were due to either working in areas with no coverage or during job location transitions.

**Conclusion of Phase 2:**
Our results indicate that no single type of data link provides an ideal solution. A multi-interface system with a data link management policy, considering financial and availability factors, should be developed. Implementation can be achieved using the techniques mentioned in Section 3.3.
