4. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
Results from the Phase 1 study were recorded manually
when we visited each ﬁeld locations. After we deployed
measurement units to ﬁeld crews, measurement results were
recorded automatically in a local database on the laptop.
We developed scripts to retrieve essential information from
database records as log ﬁles and upload them to a FTP
server from time to time. Logs from both phases are used
to present following analysis.
4.1 Phase 1 Study
From March 31, 2010 to April 9, 2010, we visited 12 ﬁeld
locations spread out in an area of more than 35,000 km2
shown in Figure 2a1. Selection of those locations is based
on operational scheduling and business concerns other than
geographical or service coverage consideration.

Table 1: Field test summary of cellular links
Field test results are summarized in Table 1. AT&T has
EDGE service at all those locations but no high-speed 3G
coverage at any of them. On the other hand, Verizon pro-
vides 3G EVDO service at nine of the locations and no ser-
vice in the other three. Therefore, signiﬁcant diﬀerences

in the average upload/download speeds between these two
service providers were observed.
During our tests, we found out that the coverage map
from service providers can be a good reference but disagree-
ments from actual measurement do occur. We overlaid Ver-
izon’s coverage map from [22] on the map of our ﬁeld tests.
The shadows in Figure 2a represent areas without coverage.
Among the three ﬁeld locations where we did not get Veri-
zon data service, two are actually inside those shadows. The
one location that “should” have service but does not is out-
side any shadows. However, its topographic situation is not
favorable: the surrounding ground is higher than the ﬁeld lo-
cation. We also monitored the TCP throughput in a 3-hours
drive from point A on the map (not among the ﬁeld loca-
tions) to a nearby city, point D. During this trip, 600 MB-
byte of data was uploaded continuously. The TCP through-
put over time illustrated in Figure 2b generally agrees with
coverage along the route with occasional diﬀerences.
Figure 3: Antenna setup and Verzion’s data link speed
We plot download/upload speeds over Verizon’s links against
119signal strength readings from data modems in Figure 3. Lin-
ear ﬁttings indicate that a 1-dB increment on signal strength
can lead to an increment of 28.4 kbps in download speed and
7 kbps in upload speed with one antenna. Using two an-
tennas generally increases average signal strength by 1 dB.
However, the eﬀect is a 15% download speed increment. We
believe this is a result of spatial diversity provided by two
antennas. On the other hand, uploading speed is not af-
fected much. Unlike the signal spatial diversity study in [23]
where geographic distance between antennas can be up to
500 meters, the distance between antennas in our setting is
a few meters. Using two antennas helps on link speed in
our ﬁeld tests but cannot make 3G data service available at
locations where a single antenna setup fails.
After we ﬁnished this series of ﬁeld tests, we decided to
use a Verizon data modem with the two-antennas setting as
the standard 3G data link in our further studies.
4.2 Phase 2 Study
During our phase 2 study, we collected measurement re-
sults from four crews stationed at Shreveport, Louisiana.
They are named as SLA1 to 4 in this paper. Measurement
study was also conducted at one crew stationed at Willis-
ton, North Dakota which is named as WIL1 in this paper.
Normally, each crew operates within an area of thousands of
square kilometer around the city where it is stationed. SLA1
is the pilot crew with which we ﬁnalized the hardware and
software conﬁguration during the time period from Novem-
ber 2010 to March 2011. Note that the AT&T cellular link
was used during that time period. This is because Verizon
did not have enterprise-level access to our company’s net-
work until early 2011 after certain business procedures were
carried out. Therefore, we name the data set from January
26, 2011 to March 20, 2011 as “SLA1 ATT”. At the end
of March, we replaced SLA1 crew’s AT&T link with Veri-
zon service so that it has the same conﬁguration as other
four crews. We present analysis of link availability, TCP
throughput and end-to-end latency from measurement re-
sults collected at those ﬁve crews.
4.2.1 Availability
work shift pattern of each crew. Figure 4 shows the link
up and down sequences of SLA2 crew in April 2011. This
crew is a day crew which stops operation and shuts down all
equipment at night. SLA2 and SLA3 belong to this category
and thus their link availability is always interrupted by such
operation halts. SLA1 and SLA4 are 24-hour crews which
operate continuously at ﬁeld locations. All crews normally
move to next ﬁeld location after working 5 to 10 days at
one place. The job location transition may take 1 to 3 days
during which all equipment is powered oﬀ.
We retrieved Windows OS’s native logs containing PC
power on/oﬀ events from diﬀerent crews. With this type
of information, we reprocessed availability logs of cellular
and satellite interfaces so that the probability that a link
is available is only calculated when the equipment is pow-
ered on. Therefore, we eliminated the eﬀect of job transi-
tion/equipment down schedule on availability evaluation of
those data links.
Diﬀerence on costs associated with usage of satellite data
links (USD 5/MByte) and cellular one (USD 100 per month
with 2-GByte cap) indicates a potential cost reduction if
a cellular link instead of a satellite link is used when data
communication happens. Therefore, we not only calculate
P (X), probability that link X is available, but also the
P (X|Y ), conditional probability that link X is available given
link Y is available. Higher value of P (X|Y ) represents more
opportunities of using link X instead of Y.

Table 2 shows the availability analysis of SLA1 to 4 in
April and May 2011. Note that cellular data link has high
availability comparable to the BGAN data link at those mea-
surement locations. The drop on BGAN’s availability at
SLA1 in May is caused by a device mis-conﬁguration which
was corrected after a few weeks. Note that the existing data
link solution using VSAT is not as reliable as the other two
links. One major contributor to the low availability is its
bulky and heavy directional antenna (size ranges from 75cm
to 1.2m) which fails to track satellite signal from time to
time due to reasons such as mechanical parts failure.
High conditional probabilities in Table 2 indicate that a
cellular link is always available when satellite links are at
locations around Shreveport, an geographical region with
good cellular service coverage. The same conclusion might
not hold at other regions.

Figure 5: Availability comparison at SLA4 in Aug. 2011
SLA4 crew traveled to southern Texas and operated there
for two weeks from Aug. 10 to Aug. 25, 2011. Side-by-side
link availability comparison in Figure 5 shows that cellular
link was down for a 5 day time period when satellite links
were available. Therefore, P (C|B) and P (C|V ) are 54.31%
and 53.33% in those two weeks. In the meanwhile, P(B) and
P(V) are 90.24% and 84.84%.
Measurement results in Table 2 and Figure 5 indicate that
no ideal data communication solution can be provided by a
single type of data links in our evaluation. A multi-interface
system with data link management policy should be devel-
oped based on ﬁnancial consideration and link availability.
Implementation on network interface selection can be done
via the technique mentioned in Section 3.3.
Both Figure 4 and 5 show regular availability interrup-
tions on those data links. These interruptions may last for
hours or even days. There are two reasons for such long in-
terruptions: 1) The crew is working at a ﬁeld location with
no coverage for a few days; 2) The job location transition
takes a few days to ﬁnish.
