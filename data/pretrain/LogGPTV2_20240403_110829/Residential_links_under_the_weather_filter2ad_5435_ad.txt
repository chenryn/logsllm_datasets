thunderstorm, this disparity cannot be explained by link type alone,
as no link types experience drastically higher dropout rates than
others. Our insight is that snow seems to affect states where snow
is less common.

hours of snow to achieve statistical significance (they did not satisfy Eq. (2)).

Figure 5: Inflation in hourly dropout probability of hosts
(all link types) as a function of the number of hours the
hosts’ nearest U.S. airport received snow (truncated to only
those with fewer than 300 hours in snow). The less common
snow is in a region, the more impact it tends to have.
One possible explanation for the regional effects is therefore that
regions that are less “familiar” with a particular weather condition
may be more heavily affected by it. To evaluate this hypothesis, we
plot in Figure 5 the inflation in hourly dropout probability of each
U.S. airport as a function of the number of hours each airport has
spent in snow. The results in this figure confirm our hypothesis
for snow: the less familiar a location is to snow, the more often it
tends to experience dropouts. Areas with very small amounts of
snow do not experience large inflation (ostensibly because there
is not enough time for it to cause damage). Conversely, areas with
snow beyond a threshold are more resilient to snow. A likely reason
for this is that regions that are more used to snow tend to invest
more in infrastructure to prepare for and mitigate it [25]. We also
performed this analysis under thunderstorms and rain (figures not
shown), but did not observe as strong an effect. We hypothesize
that this is because all of the airports we measured experienced
enough thunderstorm and rain to grow accustomed to them.
Summary and ramifications. We conclude from these results that
different geographic regions can be affected by weather to vary-
ing degrees. We attribute this geographic variation to two leading
factors: (1) the predominance of some link types over others (e.g.,
wireless links are more common in the Midwest), and (2) how fa-
miliar a region is with a particular weather condition (and thus
how prepared for it the region is). Our results have several inter-
esting ramifications on outage analysis. First, when performing
outage analysis, it is important to consider a representative set of
locations and link types; measuring only, say, cable links would
risk overestimating the Midwest’s resilience to dropouts. Second,
it is important to note the time and weather conditions when out-
age measurements are taken; collecting measurements only during
Spring months, when thunderstorms are more common, would risk
overestimating dropouts year-round.
4.3 Continuous weather variables
Thus far in our analysis, we have considered various binary classi-
fications of weather—rain (or not), snow (or not), tornado (or not),
Figure 6: Inflation in hourly dropout probability as a func-
tion of wind speed across multiple link types. All link types
experience greater dropout probabilities at higher wind
speeds, but satellite and WISP links increase the least.

effects, typically increasing at higher and lower tempera-

etc. Although these classifications are standard (they are included
in the weather reports we collect), they risk masking the precise
effect that weather conditions can have. Here, we evaluate dropouts
as a function of several continuous weather variables: wind speed,
precipitation, and temperature.
Figure 6 shows the inflation in the hourly dropout probability of
various link types as a function of wind speed. For all link types,
we see almost no inflation in dropout probability when wind speed
is less than 30 mph. Beyond 30 mph, there are significant increases
in dropout probability for wired links (cable, DSL, and fiber), but
comparatively smaller effects on wireless links (WISP and satellite).
This is reflected in Figure 2, which showed that wireless links were
not as affected by gale-force winds. Figure 6 expands on this by
showing that, as wind speed increases, dropout inflation increases
at a super-linear rate—beyond 40 mph winds, Cable links’ dropout
inflation increases by an order of magnitude.
In Figure 7, we show dropout inflation as a function of tempera-
ture. There are several surprising observations in this figure. First,

Figure 8: Inflation in hourly dropout probability as a function of precipitation during thunderstorm (left), rain (center), and
snow (right), across multiple link types. All link types experience higher dropout probabilities with more precipitation, but
to widely varying magnitudes. (Note the different ranges of the x-axes.)
satellite links are highly sensitive to temperature; at low tempera-
tures, satellite links are far less likely to experience dropouts, but
this increases steadily, until at approximately 70◦ F when satellite
links become more likely to fail. Surprisingly, at approximately
80◦ F, there is an inflection point at which satellite links again be-
come significantly more reliable. We hypothesize that there is a
confounding factor: satellite links are less reliable when there is no
line-of-sight visibility (e.g., due to fog), and we suspect that higher
temperatures result in less fog.
a dropout occurred, and the time to recover from that dropout. We
discovered that during gale-force wind conditions, wired links take
twice as long to recover than they do in baseline weather. Also,
during precipitation (including snow), wired links take 1.5× longer
to recover than they do in baseline weather. Surprisingly, although
wireless links tend to have a higher likelihood of failures during
weather than wired links, the recoveries are not significantly longer
than those during baseline weather. Combining the observations of
recovery time in this section with our observations of the likelihood
of failures in the prior section (Section 4), we provide insight into
the severity of weather-correlated failures.
All of the other link types we measured exhibit similar behavior
to one another. They have highly variable dropout probabilities at
low temperatures; they remain mostly steady until 60◦ F, then they
increase slightly with higher temperatures. Unlike with our other
results, WISPs more closely resemble wired links than satellite links;
we hypothesize that this, too, is because satellite links are affected
by line-of-sight while WISPs and wired links are not.
Finally, in Figure 8 we measure various link types’ dropout infla-
tion as a function of precipitation in thunderstorms, rain, and snow.
All link types exhibit increased dropout inflation with increased pre-
cipitation, regardless of the overarching weather condition. How-
ever, surprisingly, the magnitude of increase varies significantly
across link types. Again, satellite tends to be the most sensitive
to change. Other link types are not as consistent across different
types of precipitation; WISP links exhibit nearly the same increase
in dropouts at high thunderstorm precipitation as satellite, but far
less during non-thunderstorm rain.
There appears to be an inflection point with snow and rain: prior
to 0.1 inches of precipitation in rain or snow, non-satellite links
experience little change in their dropout probabilities. After these
points, they increase significantly and quickly.
Summary and ramifications. Weather conditions are often de-
scribed with binary categories: rain (or not), snow (or not), and so
on. These continuous variable results show that such categories can
be overly coarse; the mere presence of rain or snow does not neces-
sarily affect most link types, unless there is more than 0.1 inches of
precipitation. Like with our prior results, different link types can
exhibit widely varying behaviors, lending further motivation to
incorporate link types into future outage analyses.
5 RECOVERY TIME
In this section, we analyze ThunderPing probes to determine if
there is a relationship between the weather condition during which
Recent work has shown that ThunderPing probes (i.e., pings)
alone are insufficient to accurately measure recovery time: residen-
tial links often recover with a different address after a failure due to
dynamic addressing [43].6 In this work, we overcome this limitation
of the ThunderPing dataset by verifying recoveries with a dataset
of host-side measurements of address continuity [48] obtained from
a large CDN. With the CDN dataset, we were able to check the
validity of ∼1% of the recoveries observed by ThunderPing.
5.1 Our metric: Host-verified recovery time
We begin by describing how we determine if a recovery time ob-
served with ThunderPing is valid. First, we describe the CDN
dataset that provides host-side confirmation that an address did
not change when a host recovered from a failure. Then, we de-
scribe how we combined this address continuity dataset with our
ThunderPing dataset to identify valid recovery times.
Host-side address continuity dataset overview. The large CDN
offers a service to content owners whereby end users can elect
to install software that will improve the performance the client
experiences when accessing the content through the CDN. The
CDN records logs collected from its software installations on users’
desktops and laptop machines. The CDN software logs contain a
timestamp, unique identifier of the software installation (ID) on
the client machine and the public source IP address visible to the
CDN. Each logline contains (among other fields) the timestamp at
which the logline was created, the unique identifier of the software
installation on the machine (the ID), and the public IP address
seen by the CDN’s infrastructure at this time. Loglines in the CDN
software dataset are dependent on user activity, and therefore, their

time analysis from ThunderPing in 2011 [52].

frequency varies. These logs contained data from 04/2013 to 12/2018.
We described this dataset previously in Richter et al. [48].
Verifying recovery times observed by ThunderPing. We developed
the following procedure to verify if a residential link has the same
address after it recovers from a failure. First, we determine if a
recovery time is verifiable by checking if the CDN logs contain a
host ID for the address that failed; we allow for a one week window
before the dropout (as we did in previous work [42, 48]), because
the CDN logs are sporadic. Even though there was no coordination
between the selection of addresses probed by ThunderPing and
those observed by the CDN, one percent of ThunderPing’s dropout’s
were verifiable (from 04/2013 to 12/2018).
To determine if a recovery time is valid, we then looked for the
first host ID log in the CDN data after the recovery occurred. If the
address associated with the ID is the same as the address before the
dropout, then we consider that recovery time valid. 7 If the address
is different, we do not know if the recovery time is valid—a laptop
may have just moved to a different network.
Table 2 shows the recoveries that could be verified, by link type.
In total, 52% of the recovery times were valid (the address did not
change). The table also shows that nearly all dropouts for addresses
with cable connections are not accompanied by address changes;
this corroborates prior work [43]. Satellite and WISP addresses also
tend to remain persistent across dropouts. Although DSL and fiber
links are more likely to have their address reassigned when they
recover from a dropout, there were still a small number of recoveries
that were valid. This demonstrates the importance of incorporating
the CDN logs into this study: these logs make it possible to study
the recovery times of DSL and fiber.
5.2 Weather analysis
We now describe how recovery time correlates with the weather
conditions when the link failed. Our hypothesis was that failures
during weather conditions that presented an increase in likelihood
of failure (e.g., snow, rain, thunderstorm, and gale), will take more
time to recover than failures during baseline weather conditions.
We observed that recovery times for wired links are indeed longer in
these conditions, whereas, surprisingly, recovery times of wireless
links are not significantly longer.
7It is possible that the address associated with the ID was reassigned to a different
customer and then reassigned back; however, prior work indicated that the new address
assigned to a customer link upon reassignment is often not even in the same /16 address
block (50% of the time [43]).
Figure 9: Recovery times for cable hosts tend to be longer
when dropouts occur during snow, rain, thunderstorm, and
gale-force winds. WISP host recovery times do not appear to
be strongly correlated with weather.
For example, Figure 9 shows the distribution of recovery times
for dropouts that occurred on cable (bottom) and WISP (top) links
in several weather conditions (note the log-scale on the x-axis). For
comparison, we also show the distributions for dropouts that oc-
curred in baseline weather conditions. The numbers in parentheses
show the number of recovery time samples in each curve, gridlines
show median values. We clip the x-axis at 24h since more than 98%
of recovery times (for all weather conditions) are below this value.
Due to space constraints, we only show the recovery time for cable
(wired) and WISP (wireless); however, these are representative of
the distributions of the other wired and wireless link types. We
observe that the baseline recovery time is similar for both wired
and wireless link types: they both have a median recovery time of
45 minutes. This allows us to directly compare the effect of severe
weather conditions on recovery times of cable and WISP links.
Cable host recovery times tend to be longer when dropouts occur
during snow, rain, thunderstorm and gale compared to baseline.
The median recovery time for dropouts beginning in snow is 71
minutes, in rain is 70 minutes, in thunderstorm is 77 minutes, and
in gale-force winds is 108 minutes (more than 2× the baseline).
We suspect that recovery times in gale-force winds tend to be the
longest because they can cause physical damage to wires (especially
ones in close proximity to trees), and recovering from such damage
requires a truck roll. Recovery times during thunderstorms, rain,
and snow, have surprisingly similar durations, in spite of potential
lightning damage during thunderstorms—which could also lead
to truck rolls. These results highlight that weather does not just
increase the likelihood of outages for cable hosts, but that the
outages tend to be longer than routine failures.

Conversely, WISP host recovery times do not appear strongly
correlated with weather conditions. This means that although wire-
less links fail more often during certain weather conditions (Figures
2 and 8), they can recover quickly from these failures. We were
surprised by this result because we expected that failure of wireless
links would be catastrophic (e.g., dish goes out of alignment). The
rapid recovery of wireless links may be because wireless infrastruc-
ture has a small physical footprint (no wires).
Even though there are relatively few recovery times that we
could verify compared to the number observed with ThunderPing,
we verified that these failures come from diverse airports. For ex-
ample, for cable, even the 86 samples during gale-force winds were
obtained from hosts geolocating to 54 different airports in diverse
locations around the U.S. The samples for other weather conditions
for the remaining link types are similarly diverse.
