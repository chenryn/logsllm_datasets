-
such attacks by the most inﬂuential ADs in an untrusted TD,
TDm. The inﬂuence score of an AD in TDm is evaluated by the
number of ADs seeing this AD on the shortest path to TDm.
Our simulation repeats 1000 random selections of source and
destination ADs. In each run, TDm is selected randomly from
all TDs except the source and destination TDs. We measure
the fraction of trafﬁc between these two TDs being redirected
to TDm.
Table IV summarizes the impact of malicious ADs on the
path-vector-based routing protocols without isolation (BGP/S-
BGP for example). Each of the data values is an average
over 1000 runs of simulation with randomly selected pairs of
source and destination. Without strong isolation, the Internet is
fragile: an attacker can control a signiﬁcant fraction of trafﬁc
with only ten compromised ADs. In contrast, by leveraging
the isolation principle, SCION can intrinsically mitigate these
attacks.
XI. DISCUSSION
Accountability. Deterrence through accountability can be a
powerful mechanism for security. By grouping networks and
hosts into trust domains with a common legal or contractual
framework, SCION helps ensure not just that malicious actors
can be identiﬁed, but that they can be held accountable in a
meaningful way. Speciﬁcally, SCION provides accountability
for path construction information, as the digital signatures and
certiﬁcates provide proof of origin for the path information. A
weaker notion of accountability is also provided by opaque
ﬁelds used for packet forwarding:
the path that a packet
traversed so far leads back to the sender, and thus, a MAC
ﬁeld that does not match implies that a malicious forwarder
225
or sender is among the preceding entities on that path. Unfor-
tunately, the lack of digital signatures in the forwarding path
prevents more speciﬁc attribution.
Error message propagation. Erroneous paths, i.e., a link
failure, can be handled actively or passively. In a passive
approach, an AD would cease to announce paths containing
that link and let paths containing the link naturally time out.
Unfortunately, packets forwarded across that link would be
dropped and senders would need to monitor such failures and
resort to a different path – although without any explicit noti-
ﬁcation senders would not know the reason for the packet loss
nor the fault location. We prefer a more active approach, where
link failures would be actively announced to all neighbors who
received path construction beacons containing those links. End
domains can thus stop using up-paths containing those faulty
links, and remove down-paths containing these links on the
path server.
Number of trust domains. We anticipate a small number
of top-level trust domains for reasons of efﬁciency. Running
a trust domain is expensive because of the maintenance
of address and path resolution servers, as well as the key
management and certiﬁcation authority requirements. Given
economies of scale, the larger the TD the better the ﬁxed
costs become amortized. Moreover, larger TDs provide more
opportunities for shortcuts, i.e., more efﬁcient paths, which
again favors large TDs.
Incentives for adoption. SCION offers many incentives for
adoption. For ISPs, network operations are simpliﬁed and
costs are reduced: (i) explicit forwarding paths enable ﬁne-
grained route control without changing router conﬁgurations;
(ii) prevention of control-plane attacks also provides resilience
against router misconﬁgurations, which are a frequent reason
for network outages [18]; (iii) ISPs can isolate control-plane
messages from other ISPs for which no enforceable recourse
is available, and can (iv) validate forwarding information.
(v) Finally, SCION may enable simpler routers, as complex
route table lookups are not necessary any more.
For senders and receivers, SCION offers path control and
explicit trust, because end-points can make differentiated trust
decisions based on the different forwarding paths that are
available.
Granularity of path choice for senders and receivers.
SCION offers path choice at an intermediate granularity, where
BGP is at a course granularity offering no path choice to
senders and receivers, and proposals such as Pathlets [4] offer
very ﬁne-grained path choice. An advantage of intermediate
granularity is that distribution of path information is limited
to entities who really want to use these paths, thus resulting
in a low overhead of path distribution and consequently better
scalability. From a security perspective, ﬁne path granularity is
dangerous, because attackers can potentially create path loops
that can focus and amplify trafﬁc onto a speciﬁc network area.
Finally, verifying the adherence of paths to the policy of ADs
is more difﬁcult for ﬁner granularity proposals. Given that
SCION offers on the order of k2 path choices for point-to-
point links, it appears that path choice is plentiful for most
applications without introducing potential security and policy
challenges.
Incremental Deployment. Although SCION differs signif-
icantly from the way the current Internet functions, we can
envision a deployment path that requires relatively modest
changes. First, we observe that the current ISP topologies are
consistent with the TDs in SCION, as top-tier ISPs are the
providers for smaller ISPs in a geographic area, and the top-tier
ISP connect to other top-tier ISPs in other areas. As a result,
we anticipate that trafﬁc ﬂows in SCION will closely resemble
current trafﬁc ﬂows. Furthermore, current ISPs make use of
MPLS to forward trafﬁc within their networks. Requiring only
changing some edge routers to SCION-enabled routers, these
edge routers can perform all the SCION-related processing and
utilize MPLS to forward trafﬁc to the desired egress point (note
that the opaque ﬁeld already contains the ingress and egress
points, and thus, the required processing is quite minimal).
SCION-enabled edge routers in different autonomous domains
do need to be connected to each other, for which we can use
IP-tunnels in case they are not directly adjacent. To route to
destinations identiﬁed by an EID within an AD, either the
intra-domain routing protocol will support a ﬂat name space,
or SCION-enabled end hosts can open an IP tunnel to a
SCION-enabled edge router.
Hence, SCION possesses a natural deployment path when
overlaid on the current Internet, requiring only those entities
gaining immediate beneﬁt to incur costs.
Data-Plane DoS Resilience. While this paper focuses on
control-plane issues, we brieﬂy identify architectural features
of SCION that can enable powerful DoS defenses: (i) the
separation of path construction and forwarding protects exist-
ing paths from control-plane disruptions, as forwarding paths
can continue to be used even while the control plane is
dysfunctional; (ii) opaque paths can be used to encode stateless
capabilities [19] in a seamless manner; (iii) forwarding paths
in packets provide a return path to the source and thus
prevent source address spooﬁng naturally, enabling a “shut
off” message to reach undesired senders; (iv) while multi-paths
provide attackers more opportunities, they also give receivers
additional options, such as keeping some disjoint paths secret
which can be used during an emergency when the announced
paths are under attack; (v) announced down-paths can be
routed through a ﬁltering cluster to remove malicious DDoS
trafﬁc, without requiring conﬁguration changes on forwarding
routers.
AD Key Management. SCION requires signatures on route
construction beacons, which requires access to a private key to
compute the signature. A problem is that the disclosure of the
private key would have severe consequences for the AD. Thus,
we propose a hierarchy of keys as proposed by DNSSEC [20],
where the domain’s long-term private key resides on an off-
line system, but certiﬁes shorter-term keys which reside on
routers that need to sign path construction beacons.
Expressiveness of the opaque ﬁeld. The opaque ﬁeld is
constructed by each transit AD to enable efﬁcient forwarding.
In addition to including ingress/egress interfaces to dictate
a forwarding path, the opaque ﬁeld can also include other
information for the corresponding AD to implement ﬂexible
routing policies and trafﬁc engineering. For example, an AD
can encode unidirectional local links in the opaque ﬁeld, so
that endpoint ADs can only use a certain local link in one
direction. To support different expiration times within an AD,
expiration markers can be added as well.
XII. RELATED WORK
While no existing solution simultaneously provides rout-
ing security, control, isolation, and explicit trust as SCION
does, prior work has attempted to address individual routing
problems as summarized below. SCION builds upon numerous
ideas from these efforts.
Routing security. Goldberg et al. analyze the weaknesses of
BGP and S-BGP [2], quantifying their efﬁcacy in defending
against trafﬁc attraction attacks. Indeed, existing secure routing
protocols such as soBGP [21], psBGP [22], SPV [23], and
PGBGP [24] only address the security of route announcement
semantics, which, at best, only guarantees the paths are topo-
logically valid but fails to to ensure the logical trustworthiness
and contractual legitimacy of the routes.
Routing control. A number of proposals aim to give a
source node more control over which paths to use for end-
to-end communications via source routing [25] and multi-
path routing [4], [6], [7], [10], [26], [27]. However, in these
protocols, the destinations, which are also the primary stake-
holders for end-to-end communications, are still incapable of
implementing inbound trafﬁc control. In NIRA [15], each
endpoint also discovers and uploads paths for reaching the
“core” of the Internet. A source endpoint can thus query back
the paths uploaded by the destination endpoint for reaching
the Internet core, and construct an end-to-end communication
path. NIRA can thus provide route control for both source
and destination endpoints. SCION uses a similar style of
path construction, but adds the cryptographic and architectural
means to defend against attacks, provide isolation, and ensure
that trust is explicit.
Routing isolation. The previously proposed HLP [28] divides
the Internet into a set of isolated regions, within each of which
link-state routing is used. These regions are further intercon-
nected by path-vector routing, and the routing failures in one
link-state region are invisible to other link-state regions, thus
providing isolation of routing failures and churns. However,
HLP does not employ cryptographic mechanisms to defend
against attacks, and endpoints have little control over which
communications paths to use.
Explicit trust and minimal TCB. The high-level philosophy
of SCION mirrors that of trustworthy computing: we want
to explicitly delineate which components are trusted and
which are not for a communications system, and the untrusted
components cannot tamper with the computation within the
trusted components. The trusted components constitute the
Trusted Computing Base (TCB) for the system, and it has been
recognized that a small TCB can enable better security [29].
In SCION, only the TD Cores are trusted and thus constitute
a small TCB.
226
Next-generation Internet architectures. While SCION aims
to provide intrinsic security for the future network architecture,
there are a number of other proposals attempting to achieve
other goals orthogonal to ours. For example, AIP [17] intends
to provide accountable and secure identiﬁers/addresses for
network hosts. As another example, rule-based forwarding
(RBF) [30] introduces a new architectural concept called
packet rules (each rule is a simple if-then-else statement). In
RBF, instead of sending packets to a destination (IP) address,
end-hosts send packets using the destinations rule.

XIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Deﬂections,” in ACM SIGCOMM, 2006.
Splitting up networks into separate trust domains (TDs) pro-
vides surprisingly useful properties: it enables strong isolation
from external events and supports meaningful accountability
and enforceability within a TD because every TD is governed
by a uniform legal framework. TD separation also resolves the
problem of a single root of trust, which has plagued previous
proposals. By segregating mutually distrustful entities, each
TD can choose a coherent trust anchor (e.g., few tier-1 ISPs)
that everyone in the TD agrees to trust. Consequently, an entity
only has to trust a small subset of the network thus achieving
a small TCB.
This TD infrastructure, SCION, enables a design of an
AD-level routing protocol that supports scalable route up-
date propagation without ﬂooding per-destination updates and
mutually controllable path selection at an appropriate gran-
ularity to trade off route control with attack power. Also
as SCION makes trust explicit through isolation and crypto-
graphic primitives (i.e., signatures and MACs), entities know
who is accountable for incorrect path construction and mes-
sage propagation. Moreover, SCION is designed with forward
extensibility and backward compatibility in mind. Through the
use of opaque ﬁelds in the packet header, SCION is ﬂexible
to unforeseen extensions and is agnostic to the underlying
routing protocols within ADs. Also, incremental deployment
is possible because SCION is compatible with the current
Internet topology and ISPs’ business relationships.
Based on the well-deﬁned foundation of the SCION Internet
architecture and routing, the next step is to work out the details
of the data plane mechanisms and DoS defense, secure and
scalable name lookup, revocation and update of keys in the
AD and TD Core, and privacy issues.
