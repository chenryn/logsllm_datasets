A tool to dump the login password from the current linux desktop user. Adapted
from the idea behind the popular Windows tool mimikatz.
[
## Details
Takes advantage of cleartext credentials in memory by dumping the process and
extracting lines that have a high probability of containing cleartext
passwords. Will attempt to calculate each word's probability by checking
hashes in /etc/shadow, hashes in memory, and regex searches.
## Requires
  * root permissions
## Supported/Tested
  * Kali 4.3.0 (rolling) x64 (gdm3)
  * Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 LTS x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.18.3-0ubuntu2)
  * Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.18.3-0ubuntu2)
  * XUbuntu Desktop 16.04 x64 (Gnome Keyring 3.18.3-0ubuntu2)
  * VSFTPd 3.0.3-8+b1 (Active FTP client connections)
  * Apache2 2.4.25-3 (Active/Old HTTP BASIC AUTH Sessions)
  * openssh-server 1:7.3p1-1 (Active SSH connections - sudo usage)
## Notes
  * Password moves in memory - still honing in on 100% effectiveness
  * Plan on expanding support and other credential locations
  * Working on expanding to non-desktop environments
  * Known bug - sometimes gcore hangs the script, this is a problem with gcore
  * Open to pull requests and community research
  * LDAP research (nscld winbind etc) planned for future
