User: so I asked here few days ago about C# and its principles. Now, if I may, I have some additional general questions about some languages, because for novice like me, it seems a bit confusing. To be exact I want to ask more about language functions capabilities than syntax and so.
To be honest, its just these special functions that bothers me and make me so confused. For example, C has its printf(), Pascal has writeln() and so. I know in basic the output in assembler of these functions would be similar, every language has more or less its special functions. For console output, for file manipulation, etc. But all these functions are de-facto part of its OS API, so why is for example in C distinguished between C standard library functions and (on Windows) WinAPI functions when even printf() has to use some Windows feature, call some of its function to actually show desired text on console window, becouse the actual "showing" is done by OS. Where is the line between language functions and system API? 
Now languages I don't quite understand - Python, Ruby and similar. To be more specific, I know they are similar to java and C# in term they are compiled into bytecode. But, I do not unerstand what are its capabilities in term of building GUI applications. I saw tutorial for using Ruby to program GUI applications on Linux and Windows. But isnÂ´t that just some kind of upgrade? I mean fram other tutorials It seemed like these languages was first intended for small scripts than building big applications. 
I hope you understand why I am confused. If you do, please help me sort it out a bit, I have no one to ask.
Assistant: If I assume this is your central question:

Where is the line between language functions and system API?

Then imagine if you will this analogy:
OS API system calls are like lego bricks and lego components.
Programming 'functions' are merely an arrangement of many lego bricks. Such that the combination results in a tool.
Thus different languages may 'arrange' and create the tool in different ways.
If I asked you to create a car with lego's, you could come up with many different designs.
