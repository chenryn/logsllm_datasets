User: Is it possible to run a python script and feed in a file as an argument using <?  For example, my script works as intended using the following command python scriptname.py input.txt and the following code stuffFile = open(sys.argv[1], 'r').  
However, what I'm looking to do, if possible, is use this command line syntax: python scriptname.py < input.txt.  Right now, running that command gives me only one argument, so I likely have to adjust my code in my script, but am not sure exactly how.
I have an automated system processing this command, so it needs to be exact.  If that's possible with a Python script, I'd greatly appreciate some help!
Assistant: You can use the sys module's stdin attribute as a file like object.
