**ATT&CK ID:** T1623  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Command and Scripting Interpreter

Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide a means of interacting with computer systems and are commonly available across many different platforms. Most operating systems come with built-in command-line interfaces and scripting capabilities. For example, Android, which is a UNIX-like operating system, includes a basic Unix Shell that can be accessed via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or through Javaâ€™s `Runtime` package.

This technique allows adversaries to leverage these built-in tools to perform various actions, such as executing arbitrary code, automating tasks, or manipulating system resources. Understanding and monitoring the use of command and script interpreters is crucial for detecting and mitigating potential security threats.
