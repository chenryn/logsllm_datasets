Abstract. We present measurements of stream lifetimes for Internet
traﬃc on a backbone link in California and a university link in Auckland.
We investigate the consequences of sampling techniques such as ignoring
streams with six or fewer packets, since they usually account for less
than 10% of the total bytes. We ﬁnd that we often observe large bursts
of small ‘attack’ streams, which will diminish the integrity of strategies
that ‘focus on the elephants’. Our observations further demonstrate the
danger of traﬃc engineering approaches based on incorrect assumptions
about the nature of the traﬃc.

Introduction
Over the last few years there has been considerable interest in understanding
the behaviour of large aggregates of Internet traﬃc ﬂows. Flows are usually
considered to be sequences of packets with a 5-tuple of common values (protocol,
source and destination IP addresses and port numbers), and ending after a ﬁxed
timeout interval when no packets are observed. For example, Estan and Varghese
[1] proposed a method of metering ﬂows which ensures that all packets in elephant
ﬂows, i.e. those that account for the majority of bytes on a link, are counted,
while packets in less signiﬁcant ﬂows may be ignored.
In contrast, streams are bi-directional 5-tuple ﬂows, ending after a dynamic
timeout interval of at least 10s and terminating after a quiet period of ten times
their average packet inter-arrival time. Brownlee and Murray [2] investigated
stream lifetimes, using a modiﬁed NeTraMet [3] meter. By using streams rather
than ﬂows, NeTraMet is able to measure various stream distributions at regu-
lar intervals (typically ﬁve or 10 minutes) over periods of hours or days. In [4]
Brownlee and Claﬀy used this methodology to observe stream behaviour at UC
San Diego and Auckland, where about 45% of the streams were dragonﬂies last-
ing less than two seconds. However, there were also many streams with lifetimes
of hours to days, and those tortoises carried 50% to 60% of the link’s total bytes.
At U Auckland, we use NeTraMet to measure Internet usage (bytes in and out
for each user). In recent years the character of our Internet traﬃc has changed;
the total volume has steadily grown, and we now see frequent network-borne
attacks. Such attacks frequently appear as short time intervals during which we
see large numbers of dragonﬂy streams. With our production NeTraMet rulesets
(meter conﬁguration ﬁles), attacks like address scans can give rise to tens of

thousands of ﬂows. Such large bursts of ﬂows tend to degrade the performance
of our measurement system.
To minimise the eﬀect of bursts of ‘attack’ streams, we investigated a strategy
similar to that proposed by Estan and Varghese [1]. To do that we modiﬁed
NeTraMet to ignore streams carrying K or fewer packets. That, however, posed
the question of choosing a value for K.
In this paper we present some observations of stream lifetimes on a tier 1
backbone in California, which are consistent with earlier work by Brownlee and
Claﬀy [4], and compare them with similar recent observations at Auckland.
We present measurements of the varying population of active streams at
Auckland and compare that with the packet rate, using data gathered at one-
second intervals over several days.
We investigate the proportion of the total bytes accounted for by streams
with K or fewer packets, so as to help determine a suitable value for K. We
often see measurement intervals when a high proportion of the total traﬃc is
carried in dragonﬂy streams; for such intervals there are few elephant streams.
Lastly, we show that ignoring streams with six or fewer packets can provide
eﬀective usage monitoring for U Auckland.
2 Methodology, ‘Overall’ Traﬃc Observations
2.1 Understanding Flows and Streams
Traﬃc Flows were ﬁrst deﬁned in the seminal paper by Claﬀy, Polyzos and
Braun [5]. A CPB ﬂow is a set of packets with common values for the 5-tuple (IP
protocol, Source and Destination IP Address and Port Number), together with
a speciﬁed, ﬁxed inactivity timeout, usually 60 seconds. Note that a CPB ﬂow is
unidirectional, with the 5-tuple specifying a direction for the ﬂow’s packets. CPB
ﬂows are widely used, providing a convenient way to summarise large volumes
of Internet traﬃc data.
The IETF’s RTFM architecture [6] provided a more general deﬁnition of a
traﬃc ﬂow. RTFM ﬂows are bidirectional, with any set of packet attribute values
being allowed to specify a ﬂow. For example, an RTFM ﬂow can be as simple as
a CPB ﬂow, or something more complex such as “all ﬂows to or from network
192.168/16.”
NeTraMet is an RTFM traﬃc measuring system that implements an extended
version of RTFM ﬂows. Streams were introduced to NeTraMet as a way of col-
lecting data about subsets of a ﬂow. For example, if we specify a ﬂow as “all
packets to/from a particular web server,” then NeTraMet can recognise a stream
for every TCP connection to that server, and build distributions of their sizes,
lifetimes, etc.
NeTraMet’s ability to handle streams in real time allows us to produce stream
density distributions (e.g. lifetime and size in bytes or packets) over long periods
of time – eight hours or more – while maintaining stream lifetime resolution
down to microseconds. Furthermore, NeTraMet can collect such distributions at
Some Observations of Internet Stream Lifetimes

5-minute intervals for days, without needing to collect, store and process huge
packet trace ﬁles.
Although streams are bidirectional, that only means that NeTraMet main-
tains two sets of counters, one for each direction of the stream. If the meter can
only see one direction of the stream, one set of counters will remain at zero. Bidi-
rectional streams are, however, particularly useful for security analysis, where we
need to know which attack streams elicited responses from within our network!
Streams in NeTraMet
2.2
From our earlier study of stream lifetimes [4] we know that a high proportion of
traﬃc bytes are carried in tortoise streams. We modiﬁed the NeTraMet meter to
use this fact to cache ﬂow matches for each stream. The meter always maintains
a table of active streams; when a new stream appears it is matched so as to
determine which ﬂow(s) it should be counted in. The set of matching ﬂows is
cached in the stream table, so that later packets can be counted in their proper
ﬂows without requiring further matching; we ﬁnd that for most rulesets, average
cache hit rates are usually well above 80%.
Since NeTraMet is now based on stream caching, it is straightforward to
collect distributions of byte, packet and stream density, using a set of bins to
build histograms for a range of stream lifetimes. We use 36 bins to produce
distributions for lifetimes in a log scale from 6 ms to 10 minutes, and read these
distributions every ten minutes.
Streams are only counted when they time out, so longer-running streams do
not contribute to our distributions directly. Instead we create ﬂows for them,
so that they produce ﬂow records giving the number of their packets and bytes
every time the meter is read. From those 10-minute ﬂow records we construct
two more decades of logarithmic bins, producing lifetime distributions from 6
ms to 30,000 seconds (roughly 8 hours), i.e. nearly seven decades.
Tier-1 Backbone in California, December 2003
2.3
Fig. 1 gives an overview of traﬃc on a tier-1 OC48 backbone in California over
Friday, 6 December 2003. Only one direction is shown, the other direction had
about one-quarter the traﬃc volume. There is a clear diurnal variation from
about 450 to 700 Mb/s. Most of the traﬃc is web (upper half of bars) or non-
web TCP (lower half), plus a background level of about 50 Mb/s of UDP and
other protocols.
Fig. 2 shows the stream density vs lifetime (upper left traces) for every 10-
minute reading interval. There is little variation, and about 95% of all streams
have lifetimes less than ten seconds. The lower right traces, however, show stream
byte density vs lifetime. Again there is little variation, but only 60% of the bytes
are carried by streams with lifetimes less than 1000 s. In other words, most
streams are short but the bulk of the bytes are carried in long-running streams.

Zealand.
Fig. 4 shows the stream density vs lifetime as for ﬁg. 2. Here the stream
lifetime and byte densities vary greatly, again reﬂecting the low traﬃc levels at
Auckland. Stream lifetimes are similar at Auckland and California, with 70% to
95% of the streams again lasting less than 10 seconds. However, at Auckland
up to 60% of the bytes are carried in streams lasting only 10 seconds; probably
reﬂecting the high proportion of web traﬃc at Auckland.

Streams and Packets at Auckland
We modiﬁed NeTraMet to write the packet rate and number of active streams
and ﬂows to a log ﬁle every second. Fig. 5 shows the packet rate (lower trace)
and number of active streams (upper trace) for each second during Friday 1 and
Saturday 2 October 2004.
