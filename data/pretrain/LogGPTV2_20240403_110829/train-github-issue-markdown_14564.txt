I have successfully run Android Demo with Tiny Yolo ( _graph-tiny-yolo-voc.pb_
\- 60mb),:
      private static final String YOLO_MODEL_FILE = "file:///android_asset/graph-yolo-voc.pb";
      private static final int YOLO_INPUT_SIZE = 416;
      private static final String YOLO_INPUT_NAME = "input";
      private static final String YOLO_OUTPUT_NAMES = "output";
      private static final int YOLO_BLOCK_SIZE = 32;
      private static final boolean USE_YOLO = true;
I also decided to try Yolo 2 ( _graph-yolo-voc.pb_ \- 193mb),  
but I get _OutOfMemoryError_ when I run _TF Detect_  
My phone has 3 GB of RAM  
But I know that is just android java limit and has nothing to do with current
available/free memory  
and we can use NDK to bypass this limit.
I also tried to run with:
         <activity android:name="org.tensorflow.demo.DetectorActivity"
                      android:largeHeap="true"
but didn't help
And also:
    <activity android:name="org.tensorflow.demo.DetectorActivity"
                      android:largeHeap="true"
                      android:hardwareAccelerated="false"
App runs ok, but nothing happens, it just shows black screen, no camera
frames..
Is there a way to run app with big .pb files?  
_TensorFlowInferenceInterface_ needs _AssetManager_ and _string file name_ ,
then I guess it just uses default java IO to read file,  
mb it's better to process all of this with NDK somehow?
