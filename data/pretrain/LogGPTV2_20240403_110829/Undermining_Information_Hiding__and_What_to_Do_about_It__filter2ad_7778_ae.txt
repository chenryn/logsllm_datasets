### Entropy Gains and Detection Guarantees with Our Defense

#### Table 3: Entropy Gains and Detection Guarantees
- **VMM (Virtual Mapped Memory)** and **PMM (Physical Mapped Memory)** are measured in the number of pages.
- **Entropy Gains (EG)** is calculated as \( \log_2(\frac{VMM}{PMM}) \).
- **Detection Guarantees (DG)** is given by \( (1 - \frac{PMM}{VMM \times \text{inflation\_factor}}) \times 100 \), where the inflation factor is set to 10x for stacks and 1x for the already large CPI's safe region.
- **GP** stands for gigapages, i.e., \( 1024 \times 1024 \times 1024 \) regular pages. A regular page has a size of 4096 bytes.

### Detection Guarantees
Table 3 also illustrates the detection guarantees provided by APM when using the default 10x inflation strategy. The detection guarantees reflect the probability of an attacker being flagged while probing into the inflated trip hazard area rather than any of the safe pages mapped in physical memory. As shown in the table, APM offers very strong detection guarantees across all configurations. Naturally, the detection guarantees are stronger as the size of the inflated trip hazard area (i.e., \( VMM \times \text{inflation\_factor} - PMM \)) increases compared to the resident size (i.e., PMM). The benefits are even more evident for CPI’s sparse and huge safe area, which registered 100% detection guarantees in almost all cases. Even in the worst case (i.e., xalancbmk), CPI retains 316,838 trip hazard pages at the end of the benchmark, resulting in 99.97% detection guarantees.

### Impact of Stack Spraying
To lower the odds of being detected, an attacker may attempt to force the program to allocate as many safe area physical pages as possible, naturally reducing the number of trip hazard pages. We consider the impact of this scenario in Firefox, with a JS-enabled attacker spraying the stack to bypass APM. Figure 2 presents our results for different inflation factors, assuming an attacker able to spray only the JS-visible part of the stack (1MB) or the entire stack to its limit (2MB). As shown in the figure, in both cases, APM provides good detection guarantees for reasonable values of the inflation factor and up to 95% with a 20x inflation (full spraying setting). Even in our default configuration, with a 10x inflation, APM offers adequate detection guarantees in practice (90% for the full spraying setting).

### Limitations
APM aims at hardening Information Hiding (IH), but does not guarantee that a defense based on IH is fully protected against arbitrary attacks. Defenses that rely on IH should properly isolate the safe area to preserve the integrity and/or confidentiality of sensitive data. In the absence of strong (e.g., hardware-based) isolation, APM can transparently raise the bar for attackers, since it can offer protection without programs being aware of it (no re-compilation or binary instrumentation is needed). Nevertheless, certain attacks can still reduce the entropy and the detection guarantees provided by APM. For example, an attacker may be able to locate the base address of an inflated safe area by exploiting an implementation flaw or the recent allocation oracle side channel [28]. While the entropy is reduced, the trip hazard pages still deter guided probing attacks in the inflated area. However, if an implementation flaw or other side channels were to allow an attacker to leak a pointer to an active safe area page in use by the application (e.g., RSP), APM would no longer be able to detect the corresponding malicious access, since such a page has already been authenticated by prior legitimate application accesses.
