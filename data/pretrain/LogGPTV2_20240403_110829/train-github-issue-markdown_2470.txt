Hello,
I couldn't find earlier posted questions about this, but if there are, excuse
me for posting a duplicate.  
I wanted to animate my progress bar (from left to right), but when inspecting
the existing rules, I saw there is already a built-in transition for progress
bars:
    .progress-bar {
         /*Other CSS Rules */
         -webkit-transition: width .6s ease;
         transition: width .6s ease;
    }
However, I hadn't noticed the transition at all, so I added
    .progress-bar {
         -webkit-transition: width 4s ease;
         transition: width 4s ease;
    }
to my (adjustments) stylesheet to be sure to notice the animation.  
However, it still didn't animate on page load (and I used Google Chrome
Developer Tools to verify this new rule overrode the old one).
Why doesn't this work? _(Neither the`.6s` and the `4s`)_
The CSS Rule for progress bars is actually
    .progress-bar {
         float: left;
         width: 0;
         height: 100%;
         font-size: 12px;
         line-height: 20px;
         color: #fff;
         text-align: center;
         background-color: #428bca;
         -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
         box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
         -webkit-transition: width .6s ease;
         transition: width .6s ease;
    }
so as you can see, first `width:0;` is set, and later I set, like the
Bootstrap Example, an inline rule `style="width: 80%;"`...
If I disable (and reenable) this `style="width: 80%;"` using the Google Chrome
Developer Tools, it _does_ animate, so my problem is **it does not animate on
page load**...
**Am I missing something?**

_I'm using an iMac with Google Chrome. I tested it on FireFox as well, same
problem, so, uhm... It's most likely`I` am missing something_  
_I use Bootstrap 3.0.2, but that's irrelevant, because you can see in my
question it happens as well on the official Bootstrap Site._
