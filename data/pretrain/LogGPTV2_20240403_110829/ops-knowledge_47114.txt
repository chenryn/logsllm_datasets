User: Does anyone know an alternative to ALSA that can be used on windows, with gstreamer, and how to install it, and where to find python bindings for it if it needs it?
thanks xxx
Assistant: It seems that on Windows the SDK installer doesn't actually install the bindings to any location visible to the Python interpreter. You can find the files at sdk\bindings\python\v2.6\lib\site-packages. Copy the contents of the directory to your Python installation's site-packages, and you should be able to import the library.
