security features, making them trivial to attack and du-
plicate [7]. Data stolen from magnetic stripe cards can
be sold online or be used to fabricate counterfeit cards
that can then be used in physical stores [10, 6]. One of
the primary methods of attacking magnetic stripe cards
is through skimming devices, more commonly known as
“skimmers” [36].
Attempts have been made to increase the security of
magnetic stripe cards through examining account trans-
actions and identifying fraudulent activity. Some of the
methods of detecting illegitimate transactions incorpo-
rate data mining and machine learning to proﬁle these
transactions based on historical data [16, 51, 17]. Us-
ing the Hidden Markov Model [50] and proﬁling nor-
mal card behavior [8, 9] have also been proposed. These
methods are a “best guess” effort and do not always pre-
vent malicious transactions. The results of these meth-
ods are similar to current practices by credit card com-
panies to identify the use of stolen magnetic stripe card
data. Efforts have also been made to authenticate mag-
netic stripe cards via physical characteristics of the data
encoded on the cards. MagnePrint [4] attempts to re-
solve this problem by authenticating the physical mag-
netic material. The system calculates a ﬁngerprint using
the noise present between peaks in the analog waveform
and matches it to a known value. Major faults of Mag-
nePrint is that it requires the card to be measured at the
time of manufacture and it requires the merchant to trans-
mit the calculated signature during the authorization pro-
cess. More recently an improved system was developed
that detects fraudulent magnetic stripe cards, without the
need to measure magnetic stripe cards at the time of man-
ufacture [48].

EMV, widely known as Chip-and-PIN, are tamper re-
sistant cards that run code to perform card authentication
with the issuer. Though EMV provides more security
features than magnetic stripe cards, EMV cards are still
susceptible to a variety of attacks [53, 37, 12, 20, 22,
41, 21, 15]. Skimming devices speciﬁcally designed for
EMV cards also exist [33, 14], known as Chip-and-Shim
devices. In addition to attacks EMV has also experienced
deployment issues [24, 39]. While EMV is a more secure
alternative to magnetic stripe cards, these cards will not
replace magnetic stripe cards any time soon [27], demon-
strating that magnetic stripe card fraud will continue to
be a prevalent problem that our system addresses.
8 Conclusion
Skimmers represent a signiﬁcant and growing threat to
payment terminals around the world. Moreover, adver-
saries have become increasingly sophisticated, making
the detection of such attacks difﬁcult. We address these
problems by conducting the ﬁrst large-scale academic
analysis of skimming devices. With a characterization
of the techniques actually being used by attackers, we
ﬁrst debunk much of the common advice offered to pro-
tect consumers. We then develop the Skim Reaper tool,
which relies on the necessary physical properties of the
most common types of skimming devices found in New
York City. After successfully testing our solution on
skimmers used in real crimes, we show that simple ad-
versarial countermeasures are ineffective against our de-
vice. Accordingly, though systematization, characteriza-
tion and measurement, we show that robust and portable
tools can be developed to help consumers and law en-
forcement to rapidly detect such attacks.
