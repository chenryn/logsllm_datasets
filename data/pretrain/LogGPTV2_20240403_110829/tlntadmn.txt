Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
Administers a local or remote computer that is running the telnet Server Service. If used without parameters, tlntadmn displays the current server settings.
This command requires you to log on to the local computer with administrative credentials. To administer a remote computer, you must also provide administrative credentials for the remote computer. You can do so by logging on to the local computer with an account that has administrative credentials for both the local computer and the remote computer. If you can't use this method, you can use the -u and -p parameters to provide administrative credentials for the remote computer.
