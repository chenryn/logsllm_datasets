Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

**Log Line Template:**
```
Connection request from old client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>; will be dropped if server is in read-only mode
```

**Explanation:**
- `<IP_ADDRESS>`: Represents the IP address (e.g., 10.10.34.13).
- `<PORT>`: Represents the port number (e.g., 50545).

This template clearly identifies the placeholders for the IP address and port, and it uses the full term "read-only" for clarity.
