User: I know the httpserver module in tornado is implemented based on the tcpserver module, so I can  write a socket server based on tornado. But how can I write a server that is both a socket server and a web server?
For example, if I want to implement a chat app. A user can either login through a browser or a client program. The browser user can send msg to the client user through the back-end server. So the back-end server is a web and socket server.
Assistant: You can start multiple servers that share an IOLoop within the same process. Your HTTPServer could listen on one port, and the TCPServer could listen on another.
