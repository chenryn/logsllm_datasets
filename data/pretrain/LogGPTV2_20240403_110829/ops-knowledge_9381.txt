User: If you need to batch rename many files and directories, how do you do it using the Linux command line?
Assistant: You can use the rename command in the Linux command line, which can rename specified files or directories in batches. For example, to rename all files ending in .bak to .txt, you can use the following command: rename 's/\.bak$/.txt/' *.bak where s/\.bak$/.txt / means to replace the string ending with .bak with the string ending with .txt, *.bak means to process all the files ending with .bak. In addition, you can also use the mv command to perform renaming operations. For example, to rename a directory named oldname to newname, you can use the following command: mv oldname newname If you need to rename a group of files or directories in batches, you can use the for loop combined with the mv command to operate. For example, to rename all files beginning with old to files beginning with new, you can use the following command: for file in old*; do mv "$file" "new${file#old}"; done Among them, ${file #old} means to intercept from the part after the first old string in the value of the $file variable, and then splice the new prefix.
