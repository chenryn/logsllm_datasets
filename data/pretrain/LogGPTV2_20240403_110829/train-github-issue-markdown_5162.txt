flutter.yaml's assets support is a convenient way to add assets for both
platforms. Unclear if we want to keep it long term, but if we do it would be
nice to add support for directories and/or file globbing. Right now I'm in the
process of writing a script to update my flutter.yaml when my directory of
images change. :/
