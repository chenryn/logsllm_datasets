### 5. Discussion and Future Work

#### Achievable TDoA Range
The achievable TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) range is determined by the distance between two microphones and is influenced by the relative position between the phone and the user's mouth. Figure 27 illustrates the achievable TDoA range for a Samsung Galaxy Note3, using the sound origin model from Figure 5. The distance between the two microphones is 15.1 cm. This figure shows a sectional view on the Y-Z plane, with the coordinate (0,0) representing the location of the mouth. In vertical placement, each (y, z) point indicates the center of the phone, while in horizontal placement, it represents the bottom microphone of the phone. The color at each position indicates the achievable TDoA range.

As shown in Figure 28, the maximum achievable TDoA range for vertical placement is approximately 6 cm, whereas for horizontal placement, it is about 4 cm when the phone is placed very close to the user's mouth. The reason for not achieving the maximum TDoA range, despite the distance between the microphones, is that the origin of phoneme sounds is concentrated within the user's mouth and nasal cavities, leading to similar directions for both microphones.

These maximum achievable TDoA ranges (6 cm and 4 cm) can theoretically distinguish 33 and 23 different phoneme sounds, respectively, under a 192 kHz sampling rate. However, the achievable TDoA range decreases rapidly as the distance between the phone and the mouth increases. For example, at a distance of 30 cm, the TDoA range drops below 1 cm, making it difficult to capture any meaningful TDoA dynamics of a passphrase. This characteristic enhances the system's robustness against replay attacks, where an adversary attempts to record the TDoA dynamics at different social distances.

#### Potential Active Attacks
In our experiments, we evaluated the system under scenarios where an adversary uses similar recording hardware as legitimate users. However, an attacker could use advanced hardware to record voice samples and deduce the TDoA dynamics matching the victim's profile. Specifically, an attacker could employ a microphone array to locate each phoneme within the victim's vocal system. As the maximum achievable TDoA range decreases with increased distance, the microphone array must support an ultra-high sampling rate to achieve sufficient ranging resolution. For instance, at a 30 cm distance, the TDoA range is less than 1 cm, requiring a ranging resolution of at least 0.2 mm, which is ten times higher than the 192 kHz sampling rate. Current professional digital recorders, such as Direct-Stream Digital (DSD) recorders, which support 2.8224 MHz and 5.6448 MHz sampling rates, can be used to locate each phoneme without placing the recorder very close to the victim's mouth.

After locating each phoneme, the attacker can deduce the TDoA dynamics based on the relative position between the phone and the victim's mouth. This requires observing how the phone is placed. With the obtained TDoA dynamics, the attacker must then reproduce voice samples that satisfy the TDoA constraints, potentially by creating a synthetic two-channel audio stream. This stream can be used for a replace or playback attack to bypass VoiceLive.

In future work, we will investigate the feasibility of such active attacks and evaluate whether current acoustic localization systems can achieve the required localization accuracy. A potential countermeasure is to detect synthetic two-channel audio streams. VoiceLive could integrate with existing speaker verification techniques, such as higher-order Mel-cepstral coefficients, which can detect speech synthesis attacks. We will assess the effectiveness of these techniques in detecting synthetic audio streams.

#### Extension to Text-Independent Systems
Text-independent systems operate on arbitrary utterances, so they cannot rely on the TDoA dynamics of a specific passphrase for liveness detection. However, text-independent systems require a large number of utterances to train speaker models. We can extract TDoA values from each phoneme sound to build a model similar to that in Figure 5, reusing training data. During online authentication, we extract TDoA values from incoming utterances to build another model, which can be matched with the trained model. Thus, it is possible to use the location of each phoneme sound for liveness detection in text-independent systems.

#### Diversity in Human Vocal Systems
Individuals' vocal systems vary in the shape and size of the larynx, nasal passages, and vocal tract. Additionally, individuals have unique habitual ways of pronouncing words, resulting in different cadences, accents, and pronunciations. We investigated the similarity of extracted TDoA dynamics for different users with the same passphrase. Figure 28 shows the similarity of TDoA dynamics for four users (A, B, C, and D). Each user spoke the same passphrase 10 times, and we measured the similarity within and between users using Pearson correlation coefficients. The correlation coefficients for the same user across different trials were high (around 0.9), while those between different users were generally below 0.6. This indicates that TDoA dynamics are diverse, similar to individual vocal systems and pronunciation habits.

### 6. Related Work

In recent years, mobile devices and apps have increasingly adopted voice biometrics for authentication. However, voice authentication is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, as highlighted in recent studies [16, 33, 14, 26]. Voice spoofing attacks can be categorized into four types, each with corresponding countermeasures.

#### Replay Attack
An adversary can spoof a voice authentication system using a pre-recorded voice sample of the victim [24]. Shang et al. propose comparing a new access voice sample with stored instances of past access attempts to identify replay attacks [31]. Villalba et al. use increased noise and reverberation in far-field recordings for attack detection [32], while Wang et al. leverage additional channel noise for detection [33]. Chetty and Wagner use video cameras to detect lip movements for liveness detection [13], and Poss et al. combine neural tree networks and Hidden Markov Models to improve authentication accuracy [28]. Aley-Raz et al. developed a liveness detection system that prompts users to repeat random sentences for attack detection [10].

#### Impersonation Attack
This type of attack involves an adversary mimicking the victim's voice without using computer or professional devices. Advanced speaker models, such as GMM-UBM [11] and i-vector models [16], can effectively defend against impersonation attacks. Existing voice authentication systems with these models are resistant to such attacks.

#### Speech Synthesis Attack
This attack involves synthesizing the victim's voice using speech synthesis technologies. Earlier work by Lindberg and Blomberg [24] showed that less sophisticated speaker models could increase the FAR to 38.9%. De Leon et al. demonstrated that combining GMM-UBM and SVM techniques can lower the FAR to 2.5% [14]. Chen et al. showed that employing higher-order Mel-cepstral coefficients can reduce the EER to 1.58% [12].

#### Voice Conversion Attack
This attack aims to manipulate or convert existing voice samples to resemble the target's voice. Early research demonstrated the significant impact of such attacks on authentication systems [19]. Recent studies by Mukhopadhyay et al. show that UBM-GMM and ISV speaker models are vulnerable to voice conversion attacks [26]. Wu et al. developed an authentication system with a PLDA component, achieving a 1.71% FAR [34], while Alegre et al. utilized PLDA and FA technologies, resulting in a 1.6% FAR [9].

### 7. Conclusion

In this work, we developed a liveness detection system for voice authentication that uses only stereo recording on smartphones. Our system, VoiceLive, is practical as it requires no additional hardware during authentication. It performs liveness detection by measuring TDoA changes of phoneme sounds from the two microphones of a smartphone. VoiceLive distinguishes live users from replay attacks by comparing the TDoA changes of the input utterance to the stored data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the viability of distinguishing between live users and replay attacks under various settings. Our results also show the generality of the system, as we tested different phone types, placements, and sampling rates. Overall, VoiceLive achieves over 99% accuracy with an EER as low as 1%.
