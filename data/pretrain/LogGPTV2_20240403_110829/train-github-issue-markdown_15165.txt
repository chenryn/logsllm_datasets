Should Typography extended while providing extra properties in theme >
typography
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
When provide extra property in createMuiTheme > typography, it should be able
to access in `type` of `Typography`
## Current Behavior
Not supported
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
em... consider this as a feature request. we should be able to do something
like following
    import React from 'react';
    import { MuiThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from 'material-ui/styles';
    import Typography from 'material-ui/Typography';
    import Button from 'material-ui/Button';
    function updateTheme() {
      return createMuiTheme({
        typography: {
          content: {
            fontFamily:'Roboto Condensed',
            fontSize: 14
          }
        }
      });
    }
    function TypographyTheme() {
      return (
            {'this is title'}
            {'this is the content'}
      );
    }
    export default TypographyTheme;
## Context
usually people would use `Roboto` along with `Roboto Condensed` or `Noto` to
create a Title > Content pair
