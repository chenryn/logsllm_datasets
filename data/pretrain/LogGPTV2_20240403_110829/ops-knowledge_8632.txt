User: Provides a means of monitoring that tracks system resource usage in order to maximize system performance.
Assistant: One monitoring method that can track system resource usage is to use a system performance monitoring tool. These tools can monitor the use of resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network at the operating system level, so as to understand system bottlenecks and performance bottlenecks, thereby optimizing and improving system performance. Common system performance monitoring tools include Task Manager and Performance Monitor on Windows, top and htop on Linux, etc. In addition, various third-party tools can also be used to monitor application resource usage, such as JMX in Java applications. Using these tools can help developers and system administrators understand the performance of the system, optimize and maximize system performance.
