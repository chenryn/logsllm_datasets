### Title: Practical HTTP Header Smuggling: Sneaking Past Reverse Proxies to Attack AWS and Beyond

Web applications frequently rely on proxy servers to add, modify, or filter HTTP headers as they pass information to back-end servers. Recent research has highlighted how flawed implementations of these actions can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including HTTP request smuggling, authentication bypasses, and cache poisoning. A technique known as "header smuggling" has emerged, which involves modifying headers to exploit these flaws. Although often overlooked, header smuggling can be used to trigger exploitable behaviors in web applications when explored as a distinct technique.

In this presentation, I will introduce a new methodology for identifying how HTTP headers can be modified to achieve header smuggling using a minimal number of requests. I will demonstrate how this methodology was applied to bypass IP address restrictions in AWS API Gateway and to achieve cache poisoning. Additionally, I will show how to safely detect request smuggling vulnerabilities based on multiple "Content-Length" headers (commonly referred to as "CL.CL" request smuggling) in black-box scenarios. The tooling developed for this research will be released to help others identify new vulnerabilities using this methodology.

This approach enables more extensive testing of HTTP headers and values that trigger exploitable behavior from back-end servers. Vulnerabilities that were previously difficult to find due to the impractical number of requests required can now be easily identified.
