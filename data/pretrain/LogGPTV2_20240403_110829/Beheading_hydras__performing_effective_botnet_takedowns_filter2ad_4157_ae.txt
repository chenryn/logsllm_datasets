## Figure 6: 3322.org Aggregate Daily Lookup Volume (Log-Scale)

The backup plans for the 45 botnets are detailed in Table 4, and their associated risk values are shown in Table 5. The TIR values indicate that we are gaining additional infrastructure information, similar to the postmortem cases. The expanded infrastructure set, De, shows very large TIRs, suggesting that the passive DNS includes additional domains that need to be categorized. These TIR values were smaller, as seen in the postmortems, with the malware-related and reputation-based sets (Dm and Dr, respectively) contributing the bulk of the newly observed lookup volumes.

In addition to describing the enumerated infrastructure sets, we also identify any backup mechanisms present in the botnet. If a botnet's malware has no backup plan, it is a prime candidate for a smooth, DNS-only takedown. Otherwise, we have identified the necessary conditions for an effective takedown. The most important finding is that 42 out of the 45 botnets studied had no contingency plan for central C&C failure, suggesting that the majority of these botnets can be successfully taken down without requiring additional measures such as reverse engineering a DGA or combating a P2P-based C&C. This suggests that while performing a takedown is difficult, we are likely to succeed in many cases.

## 6. Conclusion

We presented RZA, a takedown analysis and recommendation system that performs postmortem analyses of past takedowns and makes recommendations for more effective future takedowns. RZA can help expedite the takedown process and ensure that future takedowns are more complete.

## Appendix

### A. Policy Discussion

Takedowns are currently performed in an ad-hoc manner with little oversight, making it difficult for the security community to contribute intelligence. There is no standard policy for enacting a takedown at the DNS level, forcing companies to coordinate with multiple registrars, pay for expensive court proceedings, or both to disable botnets. Our postmortem studies highlighted several drawbacks to the current ad-hoc approach, including a lack of coordination, little to no oversight, and an environment that discourages collaboration. Without effective coordination, we will continue to see instances where two or more security companies, with good intentions, step on each other's toes, as seen in the Zeus takedown case. We also saw oversight issues in the Zeus takedown, where domains were clearly being sinkholed before the date presented in the court order. Another subtle oversight issue is the method of instigating takedowns through court orders, which are often filed under seal, making them inaccessible to the public.

Trademark and intellectual property interests were involved early in the formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is responsible for coordinating critical internet infrastructure, including the DNS. Through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), trademark interests argued for procedures to protect trademarks in the DNS as early as December 1998, leading to the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP). UDRP specifies independent arbitrators to oversee the dispute resolution process, which is built into the accreditation contracts for registrars. The UDRP requires three conditions to be met to file a complaint: (i) the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; (ii) the respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and (iii) the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith. In its first year, UDRP handled over 2,500 cases involving nearly 4,000 names and has expanded since.

We suggest a similar procedure should be available to provide the security community with a point of coordination and a formal process for takedowns. This would reduce exorbitant fees paid to courts, likely be faster, and mandate oversight from arbitrators. The procedure could be applied to future TLDs as a test, much like the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS). Automated systems like RZA could serve an invaluable role in this process to reduce the burden on human operators and further expedite the takedown process.

### B. RZA with ISC/SIE pDNS Data

We replicated part of our evaluation using only ISC-SIE data. Specifically, we generated the De, Dm, and Dr domain sets and computed the respective TIR values for Zeus and five of the current botnets with the most domains we tracked in our paper. Di sets were excluded due to time limitations. Our results from the SIE dataset are largely consistent and show that the process employed by RZA can be done with other sources of pDNS data. The important detail is that the process RZA uses is independent of our private dataset and can be performed using public sources of passive DNS data. Due to regional variations, the TIR values are unlikely to be identical between the two datasets; however, the process and generated sets are the important factors.

| Takedown | Zeus | #1 | #2 | #3 | #4 | #5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| De | 4.843 | 1.108 | 0.969 | 0.787 | 0.680 | 1.944 |
| Dm | 0.000 | 1.012 | 0.969 | 0.787 | 0.680 | 1.451 |
| Dr | 1.014 | 1.082 | 0.459 | 0.718 | 0.613 | 1.122 |

### C. Window Justification

We consider the activation of a domain name \( d \in De \) to occur when \( d \) first begins to resolve to a global IP address in the observation period and a deactivation to be the day when \( d \in De \) no longer resolves to a global IP address. Figure 7 shows the number of new domain activations and deactivations for the domains in De for one of the takedowns analyzed in Section 4, as well as the net change for each day. We see that around seven days prior to the takedown, the number of activations and deactivations achieves an equilibrium, motivating the choice of a 14-day observation window around the time of the takedown. Other takedowns exhibited similar behavior, but the details are not reported due to space limitations.
