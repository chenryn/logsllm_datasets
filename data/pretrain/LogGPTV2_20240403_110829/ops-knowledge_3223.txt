User:  How to set up a Linux server's firewall to restrict access to specific IP addresses?
Assistant: Here are the steps to set up a Linux server firewall to restrict access to specific IP addresses: 1. Make sure iptables is installed. Use the following command to check: ``` sudo iptables -L ``` 2. Add a restriction rule to restrict access to specific IP addresses in the iptables rules. Use the following command: ``` sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP ``` The above command will directly reject the access request of the specified IP address 192.168.1.100, and will not allow access to the server. 3. If you only want the specified IP address to be able to access a certain port on the server, you can use the following command: ``` sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT ``` above The command will specify that the IP address has the permission to access the HTTP port (80). If the IP address accesses the port, it will be allowed to access. 4. If you need to delete the previously added rules, you can use the following command: ``` sudo iptables -D INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP ``` The above command will delete the previously added iptables rules for the specified IP address. Finally, to make the iptables rules permanent, the following command can be used: ``` sudo service iptables save ``` The above command will save the current iptables configuration and periodically write it to the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file for reboot Effective immediately.
