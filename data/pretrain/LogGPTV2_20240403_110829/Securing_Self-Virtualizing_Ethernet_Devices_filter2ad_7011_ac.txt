# Pause Frame Attack: Latency and Throughput Analysis in 10GbE Environment

## Figure 6: Victim Latency under Pause Frame Attack in a 10GbE Environment
- **Message Size (B):** 64, 1024
- **Pause Frames Sent by Attacker (frames/second):** 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300
- **Latency (µs):** 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250
- **Time (seconds):** 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120

### Observations:
- For message sizes of 64B and 1024B, the latency is nearly identical, indicating that the attack affects both small and large messages similarly.

## Figure 7: Expected vs. Measured Throughput and Latency
- **(a) Throughput (Mb/s):** 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000
- **(b) Throughput (Gb/s):** 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
- **(c) Latency (µs):** 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000

### Observations:
- The measured latency and expected latency differ slightly, suggesting that while an attacker can control the victim's latency with high precision, it is not as precise as controlling throughput.
- This difference is likely due to the internal buffering methods of the Ethernet switch, which mitigate issues like head-of-line blocking and congestion spreading.

## Experiments with Non-Intel Devices
- **Device:** SRIOV Broadcom NetXtreme II BCM57810 10GbE NIC
- **Results:** The same attack was performed, and the results were consistent, confirming the attack's validity on this NIC.

## Experiments with 40GbE SRIOV Adapter
- **Observation:** When the attacking VM sent MAC control frames (pause frames) through its VF, the adapter locked up and became unresponsive, requiring a manual reset.
- **Conclusion:** This indicates a firmware issue, making the adapter susceptible to a straightforward denial-of-service attack. However, we focus on the more stealthy pause frame attack, which is harder to detect and defend against.

## Attack Ramifications
- **Security Compromise:** If Ethernet flow control is enabled on the SRIOV device, the host's VMs are vulnerable to the attack.
- **Prevention Challenges:** Current SRIOV Ethernet devices have minimal filtering capabilities, and anti-spoofing features based on source MAC and VLAN tags cannot block the attack.
- **Cloud Provider Options:**
  - Accept flawed security and fully trust guest VMs (unrealistic for public clouds).
  - Disable Ethernet flow control (results in performance degradation and increased resource utilization).

## Improving SRIOV Security
### Proposed Solution: Enhanced Filtering
- **Objective:** Extend SRIOV Ethernet NIC filtering to include MAC destination and Ethernet type fields.
- **Implementation:** Built a software-based prototype, VANFC, to filter traffic transmitted by VFs.

### SRIOV NIC Internals
- **Components:**
  - **Internal Buffer:** Monitors buffer fill and generates pause frames when necessary.
  - **Ring Buffer:** Final destination for received frames, located in host RAM.
  - **Outbound Security:** Includes anti-spoofing functionality to verify source MAC and VLAN tags.

### VANFC Design
- **Key Requirement:** Filter outbound traffic transmitted by VFs.
- **Prototype Setup:**
  - **Hardware:** Standard Linux bridge on an x86-based server with two Intel 82599 10 Gigabit TN Network controllers.
  - **Software:** Modified ixgbe driver and ebtables for filtering.
- **Performance:** Increased latency by approximately 55µs, which can be mitigated with hardware implementation.

### Bridge and Driver Modifications
- **Bridge Modification:** Forward MAC control frames and use ebtables to filter pause frames not sent from the PF.
- **Driver Modification:** Use a modified ixgbe driver to ensure transparency and no interference with existing traffic.

This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the security of SRIOV environments while maintaining the performance benefits of Ethernet flow control.
