**ATT&CK ID:** T1110.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Credential Stuffing

Adversaries may exploit credentials obtained from data breaches of unrelated accounts to gain unauthorized access to target accounts through credential overlap. When a website or service is compromised, large numbers of username and password pairs are often leaked and made publicly available. These exposed credentials can be valuable to attackers who seek to compromise additional accounts by exploiting the common practice of users reusing passwords across both personal and professional accounts.
