While performing the HTTPS requests, we also actively and
dynamically fetch the TLS certificates and add the newly parsed
domain names into our testing dataset. We repeat the above scan-
ning process until no new domain names can be found out. In this
way, we can fully get the domain names that have security depen-
dencies caused by the shared certificates. We determine a domain
as "SCC-vulnerable", if any server (IP) that provides the shared TLS
certificate replies with the exploitable headers as we mentioned in
Section 4.
Limitation. In this iterative scanning process, we can fully dis-
cover all related domain names that might be exploitable in the
certificate sharing scenario. However, we need to send requests
of each related domain to each IP crossly, so the required HTTPS
requests shall increase exponentially.
5.2.2 Dataset. Considering the performance, we only use Alexa
Top 500 apex domains as the seed to be tested.
Domain Names. By parsing subdomains from the CT logs and
the passive DNS traffic, we get 283,311 subdomains under the 500
apex domains. After the iterative scan, we extend the dataset to
333,640 subdomains spanning 5,780 apex domains, while 292,227 of
them are under Top 500 apex domains (Table 2). The added domain
names are all parsed from the newly fetched TLS certificates.
Based on the domain set, we collect 6,765,333 domain-ip pairs
for HTTPS requests rerouting test, and 4,503,824 (66.57%) pairs have
passed the TLS certificate validation while connecting. Here, each
domain-ip pair represents an HTTPS request. The HTTPS requests
with the successful or the redirection status code (i.e., 2xx, 3xx)
cover 59,713 concrete subdomains spanning 4,043 apexes, and 34,317
of these subdomains are under Top 500 apex domains.
The 34,317 subdomains here include all related domains of the
top 500 apex domains we can get. In Table 2, we have shown the
number of subdomains in each partition by Alexa Rank. In our
analysis, we mainly focus on these domain names to discover the
SCC-vulnerable sites and measure the threat scale.
TLS Certificates. During the iterative scanning, we collect 12,734
valid certificates shared by the subdomains under Alexa Top 500.
Over 86% are multi-domain certificates, indicating that certificate
sharing is common in reality. Besides, from all partitions in Table 2,
we find the number of multi-domain certificates has a strong cor-
relation with FQDNs’ amount. As such, under a certain of apex
domains, the more of subdomains, the more of the shared certifi-
cates.
5.2.3 Analysis and Findings. From the measurement results, we
find that the shared TLS certificates can expose popular domains to
threats. Besides, we demonstrate the security dependencies among
multiple subjects or organizations.
Overview of Threats. By analyzing the responses of HTTPS re-
quests, we find 2,918 (8.50%) subdomains under 126 (25.2%) Alexa
Top 500 apex domains are vulnerable to SCC attacks. In Table 2, we
give an overview of the vulnerable subdomains for all attack types.
Downgrading HTTPS to HTTP. According to the statistics, HTTPS
downgrading issues account for a large proportion of all exploitable
cases (Table 2, C1.1). By rerouting HTTPS requests, we find the
secure connections toward 2,442 subdomains under 114 apex do-
mains can be attacked by a one-shot downgrade. The affected apex
domains include the famous ones like baidu.com, amazon.com, and
tmall.com. For example, when rerouting the requests of the sub-
domains of tmall.com to 47.88.135.224 (AS45102, Alibaba), we can
always receive a 302 redirect to http://err.taobao.com/error1.html.
The connection is directly downgraded to a plaintext one via this
single roundtrip. Additionally, 587 subdomains under 27 apex do-
mains (e.g., office.com, linkedin.com, and microsoft.com) can be
downgraded through multi-hops downgrading attacks.
For both one-shot and multi-hops downgrading attacks, there
are the security dependencies among different domains caused by
3xx redirects returned by the servers that share certificates. Like the
example we show in Figure 3, the security of billing.microsoft.com
can be influenced by that of www.msn.com after three hops. Hence,
we further delve into all targets of the 3xx redirects. We compare
the domain in the Location field with the original hostname and
show the results in Table 3. In total, we find 16.56% requests are
redirected to the same domain name via the Location field, while
49.12% to other FQDNs under the same apex domain. Besides, there
are also 34.32% cases go to the third-party domains under different
However, there is an exception for HTTPS downgrading attacks.
Referring to Figure 2, the plaintext request will not be sent out,
if ServerB returns a 302 redirect to http://c.example.com, and the
browser has already enforced HSTS for c.example.com. It means the
TLS connection can not be downgraded, though ServerB returns
an insecure redirect. So we filter out the downgrading cases of
which the 3xx redirect target domains are configured with HSTS.
After that, there are still 1,751 subdomains that can be one-shot
downgraded by traffic rerouting (Table 2, C1.2). Specially, we find
22 subdomains that can not be one-shot downgraded anymore due
to the 3xx targets’ HSTS policy, but they can still be downgraded
after over two hops attacks. It shows the multi-hops attacks can
increase the possibility of HTTPS downgrade attacks.
Bypassing HTTP Strict Transport Security. For bypassing HSTS
policy, we list the measurement results in Table 2 (C2) based on
the attack types. Within Alexa Top 500 websites, we find a total of
271 FQDNs under 43 (8.6%) apex domains that can be influenced by
the STS header of other domains that share TLS certificates. Notice
that there are overlaps of the apex domains among three types of
attacks, since the vulnerable subdomains for each attack type may
be under the same apex domain. In more detail, we can directly
clear the HSTS policy for 42 subdomains under five apex domains
(C2, HSTS-1), such as gaode.com, baidu.com, and aliexpress.com,
by rerouting the HTTPS requests to the flawed servers.

FQDNs. Each node represents one FQDN, and each link
shows the security dependency between two domain names.
apexes. For instance, maps.live.com can be finally redirected to
www.msn.com.
Summary. From Table 2, we see that the total number of domain
names for all types of attacks has a strong correlation with that of
the multi-domain certificates. The reason is that SCC attacks are
caused by the flawed servers that provide the shared TLS certificates,
namely, the multi-domain or the wildcard certificates. In terms of
the domain ranking, we find that Alexa Top 100 domain names
have the most problematic subdomains, accounting for 37.25% of all
vulnerable FQDNs and 36% of all affected apex domains we found.
We infer it is caused by a large number of shared certificates.
Security Dependencies among Multiple Parties. In our threat
model, the servers from different corporations or paries have the
security dependencies caused by the shared TLS certificates. For
example, in the HTTPS downgrading scenario, the security of the

mains. Given a pair of domain: A->B, we mean the security

accessed domain name can be influenced by both the domains that
share TLS certificates and the target domains of 3xx redirects. If a
domain name has not deployed security policies well, all domains
that depend on it may be exposed to threats.
In order to show the security dependencies in the certificate shar-
ing scenario, we extract all domain pairs, including the requested
domain (Host) and the related domain, as well as the Host and
the 3xx target domain. As a result, we find converging clusters
among FQDNs, as shown in Figure 8. The in-degree of each node
represents the number of domains that depend on it. We find the
center node with the maximum in-degree is pages.ebay.com, which
is relied on by over 900 concrete domain names. If the domains at
the convergent nodes are vulnerable, there will be potential security
threats for those around them.
Zooming into the apex level, we demonstrate the dependency
link samples among the affected apex domains in our measure-
ment (Figure 9). Overall, we can summarize the following rela-
tionships among parties that have security dependencies: (1) The
sub-domain and the apex-domain of the same corporation. As Fig-
ure 9 (c) shows, the subdomains of uol.com.br can be downgraded
by the server of uol.com.br. (2)The trans-regional services of the
same corporation. For instance, eBay registers multiple apex do-
main names (e.g., ebay.cn, ebay.de, ebay.jp) for the service of dif-
ferent regions. We find these domain names share TLS certifi-
cates with ebay.com. Then we try to reroute the HTTPS request,
originally toward their regional subdomains, to an eBay’s IP ad-
dress like 66.135.201.205, and we receive a 302 redirect to http:
//pages.ebay.com/messages/CN_page_not_found.html. Therefore,
the traffic can always be downgraded to plaintext. (3) The subsidiary
and the holding company. In (b) and (c), we see that domains of Office,
MSN, and Bing rely on the security of Microsoft’s domain, while
Xiami, Tmall, and AliExpress rely on Alibaba Group. (4) Business
partnership or investment relationship, such as WordPress/KPMG
and Microsoft, Merrill Lynch (ml.com) and Bank of America, Umeng
and Alibaba Group. (5) Other relationship, like the service providers
and their customers. For example, we find that a domain of NIH,
www.myitsm.nih.gov, can be redirected to www.servicenow.com
while we reroute the request to 137.187.0.26 (belongs to NIH). The
latter is involved in the development of the former.
