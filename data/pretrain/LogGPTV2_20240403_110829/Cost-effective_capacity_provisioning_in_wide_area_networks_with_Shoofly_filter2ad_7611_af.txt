bypasses introduced by S do not need new electrical or
optical equipment. In fact, preventing OEO bypasses reduces the
hardware required – router ports, optical line port and transceivers.
What happens when new pairs of demands emerge? S
relies on historical information about which regions communicate
with each other. These patterns decide the amount of origin and sink
trac (§2) at WAN regions. However, the emergence of trac from
a new geographical region (e.g., new datacenter deployment) or
communication between two existing regions that did not commu-
nicate in the past (e.g., due to the launch of a new cloud service) can
necessitate re-computing the optical bypasses enabled by S.
Do the ndings apply to other WANs? While our in-depth eval-
uation (§4) uses the trac matrices and network topology of one
cloud provider, we evaluated S on several publicly available
topologies and demands (§4.1). S demonstrates the poten-
tial of cost savings across dierent WAN topologies and demands.
However, the publicly available demand matrices were limited in
details which prevents us from certain evaluations. We believe that
our empirical insights about pass-through trac at WAN regions
applies to most large-scale cloud providers.

A APPENDIX
Appendices are supporting material that has not been peer-reviewed.
A.1 Flow conservation in S
L 1. Every solution that satises AllocationConstraints also
has a solution where inequalities (4) are tight and corresponds to a
network ow. That is, the ow entering each internal node in a tunnel
equals the ow leaving.
B and GC
P. First note that the inequalities on ~C
4 are convex,
equations (2) and (3) remain satised when decreasing their values.
Therefore a solution to the inequalities (4) implies that there is
a solution where the inequalities are tight equalities. Let E be an
internal vertex on a tunnel C with incoming edge 4 and departing
edge 40, then a tight solution to (4) implies that
~C

Shortcuts that don’t terminate in E are included on both sides of
the equalities. They cancel out. The equality is preserved for the
remaining ows.

A.2 Overall link modulation formats
We discussed the modulation formats of signals in bypass-enabled
topologies in Section 4. In Figure 17 we show the comparison of
modulation formats of signals between the original network topol-
ogy and the bypass-enabled topologies. Nearly 50% of signals in
the original network could sustain 16-QAM format but this fraction
declines by nearly 10% in the bypass-enabled topology.
A.3 Throughput of TE on bypass-enabled
networks.
We discussed the decline in per-wavelength capacity due to by-
passes in Section 4. In addition to the average link capacity decline,
we simulate the throughput of trac engineering on both S
provisioned topologies without additional failure resilience and
with resilience to 2 simultaneous link failures. First, we show that
at as demand is scaled higher, the failure resilient topologies achieve
higher network throughput (Figure 18). Second, regardless of the
scale of demands, topologies with longer shortcut lengths achieve
less throughput, especially at high demand scale factors. At present
day demands, the dierence between the throughput of 3, 4 and 5
hop shortcut topologies is very similar.

Figure 19: Cost savings by S in k = 0, 1 and 2 failure resilient
scenarios. The cost savings are indistinguishable in all three cases
showing that S can enable k-wise failure resilience without
sacricing cost savings.
A.4 Failure resilience vs. cost saving
In Section 5 we mentioned that k-wise link failure resilience can
be incorporated in S without sacricing cost savings. We
demonstrate this in Figure 19 – cost savings are indistinguishable
in case of k = 0, 1 and 2, showing that S can enable k-wise
failure resilience without sacricing cost savings even at highly
scaled demands.
