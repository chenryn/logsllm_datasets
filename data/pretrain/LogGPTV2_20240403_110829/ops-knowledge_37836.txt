User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What does the command `stty erase ^H` do? Probably a newby's question - I saw the command stty erase ^H in one of our log-in script and wanted to know what it does.
Does it work on TCSH? or is it only applicable to KSH?

Assistant: From: man stty: 

NAME
       stty - change and print terminal line settings
-- snip

   erase CHAR
          CHAR will erase the last character typed


This means that ^H (Ctrl-H) will be configured as control sequence to eliminate the last typed character.
