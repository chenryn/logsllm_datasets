dynamic IP ranges are also covered by other BGP pre-
ﬁxes).
This indicates that BGP preﬁx clusters correlate bet-
ter with dynamic IP addresses than rANS clusters, and
it can be explained by the coarse-grained properties of
most rANS clusters. For instance, in the previous ex-
ample illustrated in Figure 3, some of the BGP preﬁxes
belong to DSL IP ranges, while many others are Com-
cast legitimate mail servers. In this case, all Comcast
IPs fall into the same set of rANS clusters but belong to
distinct BGP preﬁx clusters.
5.7 Choice of cluster type
To study which cluster performs the best and when,
we need to deﬁne the metric for good clusters. The
natural metric would be whether IPs within a clus-
ter share the same spamming behavior (sending mostly
spam or mostly legitimate emails). The cluster granu-
larity clearly plays an important role in determining its
accuracy. We study each type of clusters separately.
The accuracy of BGP preﬁx clusters, as previously
discussed, depends on the visibility of BGP routing ta-
ble. Sometimes, a larger preﬁx may be reallocated into
smaller ranges not externally observable. As a result, we
conjecture that larger BGP preﬁxes may not accurately
discern spamming behavior.
From Figure 8, by setting the threshold of spam ratio
to 0.95, we are able to obtain a relatively low false posi-
tive rate. We then study the false negative distribution by
varying BGP preﬁx sizes. Figure 13 illustrates the aver-
age false negative count per cluster for each BGP preﬁx
size, indicating that /8 and /9 BGP preﬁx have the worst
false negative performance, and smaller preﬁxes such as
/20 - /24 have quite low false negative count per cluster.
This result validates our conjecture. We can conclude
that ﬁne-grained BGP clusters are needed to accurately
capture spamming behavior.
rANS clusters, as discussed in §5.3, are in general
more coarse-grained than BGP preﬁxes. In fact, based
on our reverse DNS query results, we found that
the largest rANS clusters observed are those close
to root name servers, e.g., tinnie.arin.net,
ns.lacnic.net,
and
ns-pri.ripe.net. Some countries such as Korea
also contribute to this. We found that most of the
IPs in Korea do not have a hostname and they all
ns-sec.ripe.net,
share the same set of reverse name servers such as
e.g., a.dns.kr and b.dns.kr. Although poorly
maintained DNS information usually implies spamming
behavior, i.e., large rANS clusters all have spam ratios
greater than 90%, they may still include legitimate mail
servers. Also, poorly maintained DNS information
occur in different networks. We found that IP addresses
under these rANS do not cluster well because they
may belong to different BGP preﬁxes, thus crossing
different administrative boundaries.
Especially for
rANS clusters close to root name servers, sometimes
they are associated with up to several thousand BGP
preﬁxes.
The use of Naming cluster is only applicable for a
known administrative boundary since the observation of
naming patterns are drawn from within an administrative
boundary. Although 1/3 of the IP addresses do not have
rDNS name, they are mixed with IP addresses that have
rDNS name and can be considered as as a type of pattern
as mentioned in Table 3. As a result, we exploit naming
pattern that can be a good indicator to split an existing
cluster into ﬁner-grained ones that may exhibit different
spamming behavior.
In conclusion, neither BGP preﬁx cluster nor rANS
cluster is perfect. However, they complement each
other in terms of capturing the administrative bound-
aries. This leads to the idea of combining them along
with naming clusters to more accurately separate good
IP addresses from bad ones.
6 Combined clusters
In previous examples, we show that more ﬁne-
grained clustering can usually lead to more accurate
identiﬁcation of administrative boundaries and effec-
tively separate good IP addresses from bad ones in terms
of spamming behavior.
In this section, we discuss in
more detail how we can combine different types of clus-
ter information. The idea is to ﬁrst combine BGP pre-
ﬁx clusters with rANS clusters to identify more accurate
administrative boundaries. We subsequently apply nam-
ing based clustering within each administrative bound-
ary to perform further separation. We show that com-
bined clusters are indeed qualitatively better than apply-
ing isolated clustering method individually.
Overall, the clustering process has two phases as
shown in Figure 11. The ﬁrst training phase generates
a bipartite graph based on the BGP preﬁx and rANS in-
formation for each IP address (as described in §3). This
is followed by the cluster assigning phase which takes
the bipartite graph and assigns new IP addresses to in-
termediate clusters according to a clustering assignment
algorithm.
Intermediate clusters combine BGP preﬁx
and rANS information. The naming clustering process

then performs naming pattern matching within each in-
termediate cluster to obtain the ﬁnal combined cluster.
The intuition here is that naming pattern works better
when we already capture a good administrative bound-
ary which can be obtained by combining BGP preﬁx and
rANS information.
6.1 Combined cluster assignment
Since BGP preﬁx is generally ﬁner-grained, we start
with a BGP preﬁx cluster and reﬁne it into smaller clus-
ters by considering rANS information. The cluster as-
signment algorithm takes an IP address as an input,
looks up the corresponding BGP-preﬁx cluster using the
longest preﬁx matching and ﬁnds one or more corre-
sponding rANS clusters.
Recall from Figures 3 and 1, we construct a bipar-
tite graph based on BGP preﬁx clusters and rANS clus-
ters by drawing an edge between a BGP preﬁx cluster
and an rANS cluster whenever at least one IP address
within the BGP preﬁx cluster also belongs to the rANS
cluster. The degree of the rANS cluster in the bipartite
graph represents its granularity: an rANS cluster with
a smaller degree indicates a more ﬁne-grained adminis-
trative boundary due to less sharing across preﬁxes. For
instance, some rANS might be third party rANS shared
by dramatically different administrative domains. Using
such rANS will inaccurately treat distinct administrative
domains as a single domain.
Since we know that coarse-grained administrative
boundaries produced by rANS clusters may not work
well for classifying spamming behavior, we ﬁnd the
minimum-degree rANS cluster for a given IP address
to increase cluster granularity. After identifying such a
minimum-degree rANS cluster, we form a ﬁne-grained
cluster by including other IPs sharing the same rANS
cluster within the BGP preﬁx cluster. The resulting clus-
ter can be illustrated in Figure 12.
In this example,
we ﬁrst ﬁnd the minimum-degree rANS for IP address
208.110.79.226 (dns.cameron.net in this case) and
then assign it into cluster 1 where all IP addresses (in-
cluding 208.110.79.226) within cluster 1 has the same
minimum-degree rANS and they also belong to the same
BGP preﬁx 208.110.64.0/19.
Note that from the above cluster assignment, BGP
preﬁx clusters may be divided into smaller clusters, or
they may be already sufﬁciently ﬁne-grained without re-
quiring further splitting. After we combine BGP pre-
ﬁxes with rANS clusters, we effectively ﬁnd a more ac-
curate administrative boundary in which the naming pat-
terns can be applied to obtain the ﬁnal combined cluster.
Table 6 shows the result of assigning all 2,737,006 IP ad-
dresses into these clusters. These IP addresses fall into

68,161 BGP preﬁx clusters and 101,050 combined clus-
ters. It shows that a signiﬁcant portion of the total IP ad-
dresses (42.2%) falls into combined clusters split from
BGP preﬁx cluster. Previously, §5.3 shows about 10%
BGP preﬁx cluster can potentially be split into smaller
clusters considering rANS information. But here we
found that about 26.3% of the original BGP preﬁxes
can be further split into smaller clusters by considering
rANS and naming pattern. Further, we found that larger
BGP preﬁxes such as /8 and /9 will almost always be
split into smaller clusters. 19.6% of even smaller BGP
preﬁxes such as /15 - /20 can also be further split.
6.2 Cluster granularity
In Figure 14 we plot the number of BGP preﬁx clus-
ters sorted by size in mask length and compare with the
result of further breaking them into more ﬁne-grained
clusters. We found that the number of the clusters that
range from /24 to /16 increase signiﬁcantly. However,
for BGP preﬁxes with size of /8 - /15, although the ab-
solute increase in the number of clusters is small, the
ratio of increase is signiﬁcantly larger. This conﬁrms
our previous observation that larger BGP preﬁxes are
too coarse-grained and do not represent accurate admin-
istrative boundaries. Overall, most BGP preﬁx clusters,
regardless of their sizes, can be split into smaller clus-
ters. We discuss the implication on inferred spamming
behavior next.

6.3 Spamming behavior
As shown in Figure 15, combined clusters have sim-
ilar behavior to that of BGP preﬁx clusters in terms of
identifying clusters containing either mostly good IPs or
mostly bad IPs, suggesting that the accuracy property
is preserved from BGP preﬁxes. Furthermore, in Fig-
ure 16, it clearly shows that combined clusters have the
best false negative and false positive result at all spam
ratio threshold from 0.8 to 1.0 with granularity of 0.01.
Using combined clusters, we can reduce the false neg-
ative rate by about 6% - 10% compared to using BGP-
preﬁx clusters, without increasing the false positive rate.
The result is expected because ﬁner-grained clusters bet-
ter capture the boundaries between good and bad IPs as
discussed before.
