Assistant: This log chunk shows the activity of Chrome.exe *64, which is connecting to various websites through a proxy server. It opened connections to cpro.baidustatic.com, intf.zsall.mobilem.360.cn, csdnimg.cn, dc.csdn.net, ubmcmm.baidustatic.com, beacon.tingyun.com, blog.csdn.net, static.blog.csdn.net, eclick.baidu.com, wn.pos.baidu.com, and c.csdnimg.cn. It then closed the connections, sending and receiving various amounts of data. In some cases, the connection was canceled before completion.
