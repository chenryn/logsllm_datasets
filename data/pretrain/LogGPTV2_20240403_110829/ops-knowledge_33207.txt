User: I had a lot of problems getting geoDjango installed on mac os x snow leopard.
After the dust settled, I realized that the system install of python (2.6) was on the recieivng end of psycopg2
Python 2.7 is on the system path. And when I invoke python in the terminal, python 2.7 is the one the is fired up.
But if I do an easy_install, or mac port install of psycopg2, it doesn't get installed to Libraries/framework.python/verisons/2.7/lib or bin  (i am working from memory here). I do however find a copy installed in the system install of python 2.6
How do I get things like mac port and easy_install to target python 2.7 and ignore the system python?
Assistant: The best way to solve this is to use virtualenv.  When you create a virtual environment, you have the option (-p) of specifying which Python executable you want.  Once you're in the virtualenv, you don't have to worry about it at all, and all your regular commands (including pip) will refer to the proper Python executable, site packages, libraries, etc.
E.g. if you want to create a virtualenv for MacPort's Python 2.7, you can do:
$ virtualenv -p /opt/local/bin/python2.7 myvirtualenv
