### German Hosting Provider

A standard personal computer (PC) is sufficient for conducting the experiments, capable of issuing queries at a rate of 40 to 50 queries per second. This rate can be achieved from a residential vantage point without any complications [11]. Scaling up the query rate is straightforward by using multiple vantage points in parallel, such as PlanetLab nodes. However, our experiments show that a simple setup is adequate for this study.

For the queries, we use hostnames from the Alexa list and ISP traces, along with source prefixes from our prefix datasets. It is important to note that, due to the significant use of 6to4 tunnels [16] and related techniques for IPv6 connectivity, we exclude IPv6 from this preliminary study.

Each issued query is logged in our SQL database, including all parameters such as the timestamp, returned records (answers), TTL, and returned scope. Before and after each experiment, we collect the most recent prefixes for each dataset. To expedite the experiments, we compile a set of unique prefixes before starting an experiment.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the capabilities of ECS as a measurement tool, we explore three key aspects:
1. Uncovering the footprint of ECS adopters.
2. Assessing the effect of ECS on the cacheability of DNS records.
3. Capturing snapshots of how ECS adopters assign users to server locations.

All queries are sent for a single hostname (e.g., www.google.com) to one of the authoritative name servers of the service provider (e.g., ns1.google.com). For the RIPE, RV, ISP, and ISP24 datasets, we use the prefixes as announced. For the UNI dataset, an ECS prefix length of 32 is chosen, as it contains individual IP addresses.

#### 5.1 Uncovering Infrastructure Footprints

We first report on our experiences using ECS to uncover the footprint of the four selected ECS adopters. The operational community has also conducted investigations [5] into enumerating CDN servers using ECS.

**Table 1: ECS Adopters' Uncovered Footprint**

| Prefix Set | Server IPs | Subnets | ASes | Countries |
|------------|------------|---------|------|-----------|
| Google (03/26/13) | 6,340 | 329 | 166 | 47 |
| RIPE | 6,308 | 328 | 166 | 47 |
| RV | 6,088 | 313 | 159 | 46 |
| PRES | 207 | 28 | 1 | 1 |
| ISP | 535 | 44 | 2 | 2 |
| ISP24 | 123 | 13 | 1 | 1 |
| UNI | 10 | 7 | 1 | 1 |
| MySqueezebox (03/26/13) | 6 | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| Edgecast (04/21/13) | 4 | 4 | 1 | 1 |
| ALL \ UNI | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| RIPE/RV/PRES | 18 | 18 | 10 | 10 |
| ISP/ISP24/UNI | 21 | 21 | 11 | 11 |
| CacheFly (04/21/13) | 6 | 6 | 5 | 5 |

The footprint of Google is the most extensive, with over 6,300 server IPs across 166 ASes in 47 countries. We observe that GGCs are typically located in ASes categorized as enterprise customers and small transit providers [18] in both developed and developing countries. In March 2013, Google servers were found in 81 enterprise customers, 62 small transit providers, 14 content/access/hosting providers, and only 4 large transit providers.

For geolocation, we use MaxMind [6], which is accurate at the country level for IPs belonging to ISPs [31], making it suitable for this study. A more sophisticated approach for geolocating Google server IPs in the Google AS is presented in [14].

#### 5.1.1 Choosing the Right Prefix Set

Both the RIPE and RV prefix sets are sufficiently complete to yield the same results, attributed to the significant overlap in their advertised address space. Using only the most specific non-overlapping prefixes reduces the number to about 130K. For our experiments, we used the prefixes as announced, reflecting the public IP-address space being used.

Comparing our results (RIPE only) to a study by Calder et al. [14], where queries were made using /24 prefixes, we see a 94% overlap in the discovered Google server IP addresses while issuing significantly fewer DNS queries.

PRES, however, does not uncover the full set of Google Web servers but yields a major fraction in just 55 minutes. Alternatively, using a random prefix from each AS reduces the number of RIPE/RV prefixes to 43,400 (8.8% of RIPE prefixes), resulting in 4,120 server IPs in 130 ASes and 40 countries in 18 minutes (at 40 requests/second). Doubling the number of selected prefixes to two per AS uncovers 4,580 server IPs in 143 ASes and 44 countries.

Using the ISP, ISP24, and UNI datasets, we map end-users to server IPs using ECS. For Google, we uncover a smaller number of servers. Using the de-aggregated prefix set of the ISP (i.e., ISP24), we expand coverage from 200 to over 500 server IPs. More than 95% of these are in the Google AS, with the rest located in a neighboring AS to that ISP.

A more detailed investigation reveals that the client prefixes served from the neighboring AS are from a customer of the ISP whose prefix is not announced separately but only in aggregated form. Our conjecture is that this is due to the BGP feed sent to the GGC by the ISP [13].

Of the ASes uncovered using the RIPE prefix set, only 845 and 96 server IPs are in the ASes of Google and YouTube, respectively. All other IPs are in ASes not associated with Google, highlighting the profound effect of GGCs deployed in many ASes. Repeating the experiments using the Google Public DNS server, we find that the returned answers are almost always identical (99%). We also find that Googleâ€™s Public DNS server forwards our ECS queries unmodified to whitelisted authoritative DNS servers of other ECS adopters, allowing us to use it as an intermediary for measurement queries.

#### 5.1.2 Tracking the Expansion of CDNs' Footprints

Our method allows us to track the expansion of ECS adopters' footprints over time. This is increasingly important as many CDNs continuously deploy servers at the network edges or within ISPs. The RIPE and RV public prefix sets uncover far more IPs than the other prefix sets. We use the RIPE prefix set to track the expansion of ECS adopters, as it is updated more frequently than RV.

| 2013-03-26 | 6,340 | 329 | 166 | 47 |
| 2013-03-30 | 6,495 | 332 | 167 | 47 |

We observe a rapid increase in the number of discovered Google server IPs over a four-month period (March-August 2013). The number of Google server IPs at least triples (345%), the number of ASes hosting Google infrastructure increases by 595 (458%), and the global presence at least doubles (261%). In August 2013, Google servers were found in 372 enterprise networks, 224 small transit providers, 102 content/access/hosting providers, and 11 large transit providers. Starting mid-May, we included the YouTube website in our measurements and noticed similar trends.
