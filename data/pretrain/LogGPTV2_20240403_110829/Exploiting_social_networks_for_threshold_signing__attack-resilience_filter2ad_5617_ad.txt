sku is available” if both u and at least (cid:100)α · deg(u, G)(cid:101) of u’s
friends are up.
We start with an intuitive treatment on the availability
of private keys. Figure 8 depicts a simple example, where u
has three friends or neighbors. Suppose u shares her private
key sku according to the two-tier secret sharing such as sku
is available if and only if u is up and at least two neigh-
bors are up. As a result, the status of private key sku forms
an alternating renewal process (cf. page 114 of Ross [31]),

where each renewal cycle (usually called “time between fail-
ures” or TBF) consists of the time interval during which sku
is not available and the time interval during which sku is
available. We will denote by Xi the random uptime and by
Yi the random downtime of node u’s ith neighbor, where the
pairs of (Xi, Yi), 1 ≤ i ≤ deg(u, G), are assumed to be inde-
pendent and identically distributed with E[Xi] = λ−1 and
E[Yi] = µ−1. Now we give an analytic characterization of
Ru(G, α, L, t), and thus AV(G, α, L, t), for suﬃciently large
t (denoted by “t → ∞” for mathematic convenience). Proof
of the following proposition is left to the full version of the
present paper [35].
Proposition 1. Given G = (V, E) and α (which speciﬁes
the two-tier secret sharing method), if Xi +Yi is not lattice1,
then, regardless of the uptime and downtime distribution L,
the probability that private key sku is available at suﬃciently
large time t is

Note that the above result holds regardless of the type of
the node uptime and downtime distribution L. In the case
that L is an exponential distribution, we are able to give

6. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS
In the above we studied attack-resilience and avail-
ability individually. Since the two attributes are at odds
with each other, it would be useful to identify good trade-oﬀs
between attack-resilience and availability. We now
present such a method and explore an example scenario.
Method. For a given social network topology G, attack
A, and node uptime and downtime distribution L, plot the
curve of limt→∞ AV(G, α, L, t) with respect to α (which can
be obtained via Deﬁnition 2 and Proposition 1). Then,
plot the curve of AR(G, α, A) with respect to α. Suppose
attack-resilience is given preference 0 ≤ β ≤ 1, then
a good trade-oﬀ can be deﬁned to be the α such that β ·
AR(G, α, A) ≈ (1− β)· limt→∞ AV(G, α, L, t). Note that the
method is made possible by our deﬁnitions, which ensure
0 ≤ AR(G, α, A) ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ AV(G, D, L, t) ≤ 1.
Example. To show the value of the method, let us consider
three possible social network topologies: regular graphs, ran-
dom graphs and powerlaw graphs, all with |V | = 100 as in
the above investigations. Let us additionally consider an-
other set of graphs with diﬀerent (average) node degrees,
namely a regular graph with node degree 10, a random graph
with average node degree 9.96, and a powerlaw graph with
an average node degree 9.7. Moreover, we consider three
types of social network node uptime and downtime distribu-
tions — exponential distribution (exp), Pareto distribution
(pareto) and (truncated) normal distribution (normal).
Figure 9 corresponds to the case of exponential node up-
time and downtime distribution with λ = 0.5 and µ = 1,
from which we draw the following observations. First, the
(average) degree of a graph has a mixed impact on attack-
resilience in the case of regular graph topologies, but has
a positive impact on attack-resilience in the case of ran-
dom and powerlaw graph topologies. Speciﬁcally, for a ﬁxed
α, a regular graph with node degree 10 sometimes exhibits a
better attack-resilience than a regular graph with node
degree 4 (e.g., α = 0.5 and α = 1), and sometimes ex-
hibits a worse attack-resilience (e.g., α = 0.8). How-
ever, in both random and powerlaw graph topology cases,
the graphs with average node degree approximately 10 al-
most always exhibit a better attack-resilience than their
respective counterparts with average node degree approxi-
mately 4. From this observation we remark that to “prune”
or “add” some edges in a given social network topology does
not necessarily improve or hurt attack-resilience from a
whole-system perspective. Second, the (average) degree of
333
a graph has a mixed impact on availability in all three
considered graph topologies. However, there are still some
interesting patterns. In the case of regular graphs, node de-
gree has a positive impact on availability (i.e., a larger
node degree leads to a better availability) when α ≤ 0.6,
but has a mixed impact when α > 0.6. In both random and
powerlaw graph cases, average node degree has a positive
impact on availability when α ≤ 0.7, but has a negative
impact on availability (i.e., a smaller average node degree
leads to a better availability). Therefore, α ∈ [0.6, 0.7]
empirically plays a crucial role.
Figure 10 corresponds to the case of Pareto node uptime
and downtime distribution with exponent k = 1.5 and min-
imal value xm = 0 for up time, and exponent k = 3.0 and
minimal value xm = 0 for down time. Now we draw the fol-
lowing observations. First, the (average) degree of a graph
has a mixed impact on attack-resilience in the case of
regular graph topologies, but generally has a positive impact
on attack-resilience in the case of random and powerlaw
graph topologies. Speciﬁcally, for a ﬁxed α, a regular graph
with node degree 10 sometimes exhibits a better attack-
resilience than a regular graph with node degree 4 (e.g.,
α = 1), and sometimes exhibits a worse attack-resilience
(e.g., α = 0.8). However, in both random and powerlaw
graph topology cases, a graph with average node degree
approximately 10 almost always exhibits a better attack-
resilience than its respective counterpart with average
node degree approximately 4. This means that to “prune”
or “add” some edges in a given social network topology does
not necessarily improve or hurt attack-resilience from a
whole-system perspective. Second, the (average) degree of
a graph has a mixed impact on availability in all three
considered graph topologies. However, there are still some
interesting patterns. In the case of regular graphs, node de-
gree has a positive impact on availability (i.e., a larger
node degree leads to a better availability) when α ≤ 0.62,
but has a mixed impact when α > 0.62. In the case of ran-
dom graphs, average node degree has a positive impact on
availability when α ≤ 0.77, but has a negative impact
on availability when α > 0.77.
In the case of power-
law graphs, average node degree has a positive impact on
availability when α ≤ 0.8, but has a negative impact on
availability when α > 0.8. Therefore, α ∈ [0.6, 0.8] em-
pirically plays a crucial role.
Figure 11 corresponds to the case of normal node up-
time and downtime distribution with mean uptime 2 and
standard deviation 0.5, and mean downtime 1 and standard
deviation 0.25, from which we draw the following observa-
tions. Note that since the normal distribution may yield
non-positive values, we truncate it at 1× 10−7, which should
have no signiﬁcant eﬀect since it is four standard deviations
below the mean. First, the (average) degree of a graph has
a mixed impact on attack-resilience in the case of reg-
ular graph topologies, but does have a positive impact on
attack-resilience in the case of random and powerlaw
graph topologies. Speciﬁcally, for a ﬁxed α, a regular graph
with node degree 10 sometimes exhibits a better attack-
resilience than a regular graph with node degree 4 (e.g.,
α = 1), and sometimes exhibits a worse attack-resilience
(e.g., α = 0.8). However, in both random and powerlaw
graph topology cases, a graph with average node degree
approximately 10 almost always exhibits a better attack-
resilience than its respective counterpart with average
