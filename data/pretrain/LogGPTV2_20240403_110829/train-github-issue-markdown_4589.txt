Both danish and faroese keyboard layouts uses Alt Gr-´ to print the pipe
character "|" but the key binding resolver registers Alt Gr-´ as "ctrl-alt-["
I tried adding the following rule to keymap.cson:
    '.workspace .editor:not(.mini)':
      'ctrl-alt-[': 'native!'
But this causes atom to both fold the current line and print |. I tried
changing it to
    '.workspace .editor:not(.mini)':
      'ctrl-alt-[': 'notset!'
but that caused atom to neither fold or print the pipe.
I've tried adding rules to ".workspace .editor", ".workspace" and "body" but
no matter how much I fiddle around with the keymap.cson file I cannot get atom
to consistently print | and not fold the current line.
If I bind ctrl-alt-[ to something other than native! or notset! then atom
consistently calls that command, but I cannot find any documentation about
binding a keystroke pattern to print a specific character.
I'm using Atom 0.136.0 on Windows 7 64bit
