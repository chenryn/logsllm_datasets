Subject: Issues with PyDev and Running Python Shell as an External Tool in Eclipse

Dear Support Team,

I have successfully set up PyDev in my Eclipse environment, using the following path for the Python interpreter:
```
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Python
```
I chose this path because the Python executable under `/usr/bin` is an alias, which Eclipse could not recognize. After setting up, I am able to run my Python scripts without any issues. However, I encounter a problem when attempting to run the Python shell as an external tool. The error message I receive is:
```
Variable references empty selection ${resource_loc}
```
The same issue occurs if I use `${container_loc}`.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this problem?

Best regards,
Sunit

Hello Sunit,

Thank you for reaching out. While your post may be from some time ago, I hope that my response will still be of assistance, especially to new users facing similar issues.

To address your setup and configuration, here are a few steps and tips that might help:

1. **Using Eclipse Marketplace**:
   - You can easily install PyDev by going to the "Help" menu, selecting "Eclipse Marketplace," and searching for "PyDev." This should help you get the latest version installed seamlessly.

2. **Adding PyDev to the Top-Right Dock**:
   - Ensure that PyDev is properly integrated into your Eclipse environment. You can add it to the top-right dock for easy access.

3. **Configuring the Python Interpreter**:
   - It seems like you have already correctly set the Python interpreter path. Make sure that the path is valid and accessible.

4. **Running the Python Shell as an External Tool**:
   - The error message you're seeing, `Variable references empty selection ${resource_loc}`, suggests that the variables used in the external tool configuration are not being resolved.
   - To fix this, ensure that the project or file is selected in the Project Explorer before running the external tool. The `${resource_loc}` variable refers to the location of the currently selected resource (file or folder).
   - Alternatively, you can try using absolute paths in your external tool configuration to avoid dependency on these variables.

5. **Example Configuration**:
   - In the "External Tools Configurations" dialog, you can set the "Location" to the full path of the Python interpreter and the "Working Directory" to the project's root directory.
   - For the "Arguments" field, you can specify the script or command you want to run, e.g., `-c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"`.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your Eclipse version and any additional error messages. 

Hope this helps, and happy coding!
