User: I setup PyDev with this path for the python interpreter
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Python
since the one under /usr/bin were alias and Eclipse won't select it. I can run my python script now but cannot run the shell as an external tool. The message I get is
variable references empty selection ${resource_loc}
Same if I use {container_loc}
Any thoughts ?

Assistant: I know this is a ancient post... but, in case of some newbee like me to get the better answer.
I just using "Eclipse Marketplace" from the "Help" menu and search for keyword "python" or "PyDev" to get PyDev, and get it successfully installed.
AND, you should add PyDev to the top-right dock.
For the instance, my eclipse on my laptop's OSX is (Version: Indigo Service Release 2 Build id: 20120216-1857).
Have fun, folks! :)
