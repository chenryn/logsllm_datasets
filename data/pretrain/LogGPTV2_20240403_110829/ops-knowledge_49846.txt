I am trying to determine the best way to move a file from one specified folder to another using Python. I have found two different methods to accomplish this:

1. Using `os.rename`:
   ```python
   import os
   os.rename("path/to/current/filename.txt", "path/to/new/destination/for/filename.txt")
   ```

2. Using `shutil.move`:
   ```python
   import shutil
   shutil.move("path/to/current/filename.txt", "path/to/new/destination/for/filename.txt")
   ```

Which method is better for moving the file to the destination folder and ensuring that any duplicate files in the destination are deleted?

Additionally, I understand that `os.rename` will effectively move the file by renaming it, which means the original file will be relocated to the new destination. If there are any doubts about this, I can test it with a sample file.

Thank you for your assistance.
