In last weeks I noticed that default logger behavior is confusing.
Test kernel setup results in additional (usually unwanted) console output with
phpunit, etc.
Questions about it are pretty common on symfony slack channel, usually there
is someone "who knows", but it shouldn't be like that.
And it's not easy to find out how to change it. Currently, the best
description I found is @dunglas comment under a blogpost.
Console component docs was improved in #8896, but we still miss (I think so)
documentation for minimalistic logger and something in testing section that
could tell the others how it behaves and how to change it. Some
recommendations here would be great.
I would love to help, but first: how do you see it?
