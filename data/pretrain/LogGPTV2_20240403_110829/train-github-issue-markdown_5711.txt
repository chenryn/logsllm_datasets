  * Electron version: all
  * Operating system: OSX
Example repo is here.
If you embed an `` and then within that `` you do this:
    // child returns undefined
    var child = window.open(...)
`child` will be `undefined`, instead of the `BrowserWindowProxy`.
Changing the code to this works by returning the proxy:
    var child = window.top.open(...)
In my case I am embedding guest content in an `` and cannot force the
users to update their code.
