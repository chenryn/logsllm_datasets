purpose of service exchange is mutually beneficial value co-creation, mean-
ing that service system entities engaging in service exchange employ their
resources to integrate them with the exchange partner’s resources in order
to jointly create value for all parties. Whereas mutually beneficial value co-
creation is the intended favorable outcome of service exchange, the model
30 2 Conceptual Frameworks
recognizes other possible (and unfavorable) outcomes in line with the ISPAR
model of service interaction outcomes [11].

2.5.2 Mutually Beneficial Value Co-Creation
TheResource-Service-Systemmodelfullyadherestotheservice-dominanteco-
nomic world view put forward by the Service-Dominant Logic. Therefore,
both descriptive theories are very similar and concepts like operant/operand
resource and service are shared. Further, while the Service-Dominant Logic
does not employ the term service system, it is clear that the actor concept
is the same as the service system entity concept in the Resource-Service-
System model. The integrated concept map of Fig. 2.7, therefore, replaces
the actor concept by the service system entity concept. Nevertheless, adding
the Resource-Service-System model further enriches the conceptual model of
service that we gradually built throughout this section. First, the Resource-
Service-System model stresses more than the Service-Dominant Logic does
that in an economic context, service is exchanged for service through inter-
actions between service system entities. The kernel concept of the model is
serviceexchange,notservice.Asacorollary,whiletheService-DominantLogic

them,theResource-Service-Systemmodelclarifiesthatthepurposeofservice
exchange is mutually beneficial value co-creation, i.e., value is created jointly
forbothservicebeneficiaries.Second,theResource-Service-Systemmodelrec-
ognizes (like the work system perspective described in [4] does) that this
intended outcome might di↵er from the actual outcome of the interactions
between service system entities.
2.5.3 From Service System to Service Exchange Between Service
System Entities
The detailing of service exchange in terms of interactions between service
system entities, in the form of joint and/or separate activities, provides for
bridges with the two theories that focus more on the production/operational
side of service processes and systems. Clearly, a service system activity as in
theWorksystemmetamodelisanactivityasdefinedbytheResource-Service-
System model, however, this is also true for an activity in the customer work
system(coincidingornotwithaprovideservicesystemactivity).Theconcept
of interaction episode is defined similarly to the concept of process in the
Unified Services Theory, though it is used to represent the actual conduct of
the activities in a single instance of service execution and should, therefore,
be distinguished from a process “model”. The service system concept of the
Work system metamodel is di↵erent from the service system entity in the
Resource-Service-System model as a service system entity (or actor in the
Service-Dominant Logic; hence, producer/consumer in the Unified Services
Theory) needs a work system (containing production processes) to perform a
service.
A service system entity can itself be a resource in a “larger” work sys-
tem.ThisisconsistentwiththesystemicviewoftheResource-Service-System
model (i.e., a service system entity can be used as an operant resource that
acts in a service that is exchanged by the supra-entity controlling the entity),
but also covers scenarios like consumers that are used as input in service pro-
cesses according to the Unified Services Theory and fully automated service
systemsthatperformactorrolesinactivitiesofahigher-levelservicesystemas
madepossiblybytheWorksystemmetamodel.Theoperationaldetailsofthe
Work system metamodel surpass that of the Resource-Service-System model,
but on the other hand service exchange as a concept is missing, which makes
the integration valuable as it allows creating a more complete concept base
for identifying the elements that compose a service system conceptualization
for designing the intended white-box service description language.

duetosomefundamentaldi↵erencesinviewonthenatureofserviceandvalue
creation. Therefore, multiple interpretations of service and value creation co-
exist.
All four theories consider service as an “occurrent” or “perdurant” rather
than a “continuant” or “endurant”, meaning something that happens rather
than something that exists. While the definition of service in the Service-
Dominant Logic, the Work system metamodel, and the Resource-Service-
Systemmodelis(almost)identical,i.e.,serviceisdefinedasaprocessinwhich
something is done that benefits someone else, the Unified Services Theory,
which does not directly define the concept of service, recognizes the existence
of non-service processes. But as those non-service processes still produce out-
puts that consumers turn into benefits, the other three theories would argue
that service was brought about.
The real di↵erence in view on service depends on how service is “pro-
duced”. The Unified Services Theory is clearly the most restrictive as service
processes need individual consumer inputs, which, given the many kinds in
which those inputs can exist, is still much broader than requiring services to
be co-produced. Co-production is recognized by the Work system metamodel
as customers participating as actors in the provider’s service system activi-
ties,however,itisoptional.Therecanbeservicewithoutco-production,even
without individual customer inputs that are made available to the provider’s
service system.
Allfourtheoriesagreethatthedeterminationofvalueistheconsumer/cus-
tomer’s business. For the Service-Dominant Logic and the Resource-Service-
System model, this value capture by the service beneficiary is co-creation of
value. For the Work system metamodel, this value capture, by the customer
work system (or as in the Unified Services Theory, consumer’s consumption
process)isnotco-creationunlessactivitiesinthecustomerworksystemcoin-
cide with activities in the provider service system. So there is a fundamental
di↵erence in the definition of value co-creation between on the one hand the
Work system metamodel and on the other hand the Service-Dominant Logic
and the Resource-Service-System model. Despite this di↵erent conceptualiza-
tion of value co-creation, the notion of service is almost the same in these
three theories.
TheResource-Service-Systemmodeladherestothesameservice-dominant
economic worldview as promoted by the Service-Dominant Logic and, hence,
does not di↵er from that theory. It does stress, more than the Service-
Dominant Logic does, the praxeology of service. Economic actors exchange
service for their mutual benefit, hence, the exchange of service for service is a
mutuallybeneficialvalueco-creationphenomenon.Further,italsorecognizes,
like the Work system metamodel does, that service is an outcome which is
not always achieved, even when intended.
Despite these di↵erences, we believe that the end result of our analysis
and modeling exercise (Fig. 2.7), is a rich, multi-perspective concept base for
designing a service system model that provides a conceptual foundation for
34 2 Conceptual Frameworks
the LSS-USDL language. Each of the reviewed theories has the ability to add
conceptsthatarepotentiallyrelevanttoawhite-boxservicesystemconceptu-
alization. The Service-Dominant Logic emphasizes that service is a process of
operant resources acting upon operand resources. The Unified Services The-
ory sees the service production process as di↵erent from the value extraction
process.TheWorksystemmetamodeladdsoperationaldetailstoservicepro-
duction, involving di↵erent kinds of operant and operand resources, and puts
forward the notion of service system. Finally, the Resource-Service-System
model adds the service exchange aspect and stresses that, in an economic
context, value co-creation should be mutually beneficial. From a white-box
perspective, this mutually beneficial value co-creation results from a series of
activities, separately or jointly performed by service system entities, where
these activities are part of the provider service system and/or customer work
system,andcanbeorganizedasprocesses.Processes,activities,andresources
