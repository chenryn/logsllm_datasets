Question: "Consider a scenario where a class in a Java application includes a method that returns a reference to a private array of sensitive user data. This exposure represents a security vulnerability since the returned reference allows external modification of the private data. Which of the following approaches would be effective in mitigating this security risk while maintaining functionality?"
 "A": "Modify the method to return a new array containing a copy of the private data."
 "B": "Keep the method public, but change the array to a non-mutable collection."
 "C": "Declare the method as synchronized to prevent concurrent access."
 "D": "Remove the method and require direct access to the private array."
Answer: A
