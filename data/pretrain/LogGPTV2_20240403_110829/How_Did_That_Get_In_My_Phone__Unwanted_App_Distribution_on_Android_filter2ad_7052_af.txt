# Analysis of Installers
## Permissions and Silent Install Capabilities
To determine if these installers can perform silent installations, we checked if any APK from the installer requests the `INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission in their manifest. The results are as follows:

- **Installer with INSTALL_PACKAGES Permission**: 50% (half of the installers)
- **Installer without INSTALL_PACKAGES Permission**: 50%

While having the `INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission indicates the capability to perform silent installs, it does not necessarily mean that the installer is using this capability.

## Distribution and Prevalence
### Key Findings
- **Top Unknown Unwanted Installers**: Often distribute apps not available on the Google Play Store.
- **Notable Installer**: `cn.feelcool.superfiles` distributes almost exclusively unwanted apps.
- **Pre-Installed Installers**: Seven of the installers are likely pre-installed, indicating PPI (Pay-Per-Install) agreements with vendors and carriers.
- **Silent Installation Capability**: Five of the pre-installed installers can perform installations without user consent, but it is unknown whether they use this capability.

### Detailed Breakdown
| Package Name | Children | Signature | GPR (Silent Install Capable) |
|--------------|----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| com.vivo.game | 12 | 11 | 0.0% |
| com.zte.aliveupdate | 12 | 12 | 41.7% |
| com.miui.system | 28 | 30 | 14.3% |
| com.transsion.appupdate | 23 | 23 | 17.4% |
| com.rahul.videoderbeta | 30 | 28 | 60.0% |
| Other | 18 | 17 | 0.0% |
| Other | 31 | 23 | 29.0% |
| Other | 11 | 11 | 63.6% |
| Other | 25 | 24 | 84.0% |
| Other | 21 | 21 | 9.5% |

### Apps from Alternative Markets
Apps in the "Other" category are often installed from multiple alternative markets where they are popular. We investigated whether these installs could have occurred without user consent. While we cannot definitively confirm user consent, we can determine that in some cases, user consent was necessary due to the lack of required permissions for silent installations.

## Related Work
Several studies have quantified malware in the Google Play Store and third-party markets. Our work measures malware distribution through various channels, including the Play market, alternative markets, browsers, IM, and PPI services. Prior research has analyzed malware distribution on Windows, but these findings may not directly apply to Android due to platform differences.

### Key Studies
- **Malware in Google Play Store**: [24], [74]
- **Third-Party Markets**: [53], [57], [77]
- **Windows Malware Distribution**: [23], [38], [58], [59], [35], [60]

### Emerging Trends in Android Malware
- **Behavioral Analysis**: [71] conducted a behavioral analysis of 1.2 million Android malware samples over eight years (2010-2017).
- **Industrial Threat Reports**: [7], [9], [10], [12] analyze new threats in the Android malware ecosystem.
- **Mobile Advertising Libraries**: [29], [68], [69] and defenses against ad fraud [30], [65].

### Prevalence and Distribution
- **Pre-Installed Apps**: [33] analyzed 2.7K Android devices and found that a significant fraction of pre-installed software exhibits potentially unwanted behavior.
- **Stalking Apps**: [61] detected 855 stalking apps in 172K devices over 2017-2019.

## Limitations
### Selection Bias
- **AV Installed Devices**: Only devices with an AV client are included, which may underrepresent devices without AV.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Skewed towards countries with a larger market share for the security vendor.
- **Parent Signer Recovery**: Focused on 412M (24%) install events for which the parent's signer could be recovered, potentially biased towards unwanted installers.

### Pre-Installed Apps
- **/system/ Directory**: Previous works consider apps installed under the `/system/` directory as pre-installed. Our dataset lacks this information, so we used proxies such as platform keys and user reports.

### User Consent
- **INSTALL_PACKAGES Permission**: Checked for this permission, but its presence does not guarantee silent installs.

### Play Presence
- **App Availability**: Checked once in February 2020, making our 24% estimate a lower bound. Many apps may have been removed since then.

### Malware vs. PUP
- **Classification**: 60% of unwanted APKs are classified as PUP, and 40% as malware. PUP prevalence might be underestimated.

### Publisher Clustering
- **Multiple Signing Keys**: Publishers using multiple keys will be identified as multiple publishers, possibly lowering the detection rate.

## Conclusion
This study analyzes the distribution vectors of unwanted apps on Android devices, including official and alternative markets, web downloads, PPI services, bloatware, backup restoration, and IM tools. We found that between 10% and 24% of users encounter at least one unwanted app, with the Play market being the main distribution vector. Alternative markets and bloatware are also significant sources. Web downloads are rare but risky, and unwanted apps can persist through phone replacements due to automated backups.
