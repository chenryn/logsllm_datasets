### Your Goal: Become a Harder Target

#### Understanding the Risks
Many of the same risks that apply in the physical world also exist in the digital realm. For example, in the case of *U.S. v. Schaffer*, it was clear that suspects should be aware of the potential consequences of their online actions. A key piece of advice from this case is that if you were to receive legal counsel, they might advise you not to respond to or engage with any content that could incriminate you.

#### Avoiding Direct Engagement
- **Do Not Engage Directly with Individuals:** Refrain from direct communication with individuals who may pose a threat or are involved in illegal activities.
- **Avoid Forums Promoting Illegal Activity:** Stay away from online forums and platforms known to support or promote illegal activities.

#### Managing Online Presence
- **Consider Disabling Comments:** To reduce the risk of unwanted interactions, consider disabling comments on your posts and content.
- **Be Cautious with Public Statements:** Be mindful of what you post publicly, as it can be used against you in various contexts.

#### Authorship Analysis in Cybercrime Investigation
Authorship analysis is a critical tool in cybercrime investigations. It involves analyzing the writing style, vocabulary, and other linguistic features to identify the author of a piece of text. This can be particularly useful in cases where the identity of the perpetrator is unknown but their written communications are available.

By following these guidelines, you can make yourself a harder target for both physical and digital threats.
