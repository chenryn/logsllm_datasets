## Abstract
We explore the potential of leveraging the widespread availability of WiFi to provide cost-effective connectivity for moving vehicles, supporting common applications such as web browsing and Voice over IP (VoIP). Our study, based on measurements from two vehicular testbeds in different cities, reveals that current WiFi handoff methods, which involve communication with one basestation at a time, often result in frequent disruptions. We find that communicating with multiple basestations simultaneously can significantly reduce these disruptions. This insight led us to develop ViFi, a protocol that opportunistically exploits basestation diversity to minimize disruptions and support interactive applications for mobile clients. ViFi uses a decentralized and lightweight probabilistic algorithm for coordination among participating basestations. Our evaluation, including a two-month deployment and trace-driven simulations, shows that ViFi's link-layer performance is close to an ideal diversity-based protocol. Using VoIP and short TCP transfers as examples, we demonstrate that the improved link-layer performance translates to better application performance. In our deployment, ViFi doubles the number of successful short TCP transfers and doubles the length of disruption-free VoIP sessions compared to existing WiFi-style handoff protocols.

## 1. Introduction
Our work is motivated by two key observations: the growing need for affordable, high-quality Internet access from moving vehicles and the increasing ubiquity of inexpensive WiFi (802.11) networks. While cellular networks can provide this connectivity, they are often expensive. In contrast, WiFi networks are becoming increasingly prevalent, with entire cities being covered [38, 39].

This ubiquity raises an intriguing question: can WiFi deployments support common applications such as web browsing, instant messaging, and VoIP from moving vehicles? Previous studies have explored connectivity from vehicles to open-access basestations, proposing techniques to improve connectivity to individual basestations [8, 19] and new applications that work well in such environments [4, 14]. However, our goal is to push beyond these special-case scenarios to support a broader range of common applications.

Our primary contribution is the design of ViFi, a protocol that minimizes disruptions in WiFi connectivity to support interactive applications from moving vehicles. ViFi's design is informed by a rigorous measurement study of two vehicular testbeds in different cities. The study aims to understand the fundamental challenges in supporting interactive applications and to identify opportunities that can be leveraged in this environment.

We find that current WiFi handoff methods, which involve communication with one basestation at a time, lead to frequent disruptions in connectivity, even when clients are close to WiFi basestations. These hard handoffs are limited by gray periods where connectivity drops sharply and unpredictably, the difficulty of estimating continuously changing channel quality, and the burstiness of losses. Although the impact on delay or disruption-tolerant applications is small, the user-perceived quality for interactive applications that require consistent connectivity deteriorates significantly.

We also find that using multiple basestations simultaneously (macrodiversity) can help reduce disruptions for vehicular clients. This approach has been successful in cellular networks [37] and can overcome the limitations of hard handoffs due to the independence of packet losses across basestations. ViFi exploits macrodiversity and opportunistic receptions by nearby basestations to minimize disruptions for mobile clients. The challenge in designing ViFi lies in coordinating among basestations that opportunistically receive packets. ViFi addresses this challenge using a simple yet effective probabilistic algorithm, ensuring low per-packet overhead and minimal wasted transmissions.

## 2. Experimental Platforms
Our designs and evaluations are based on experiments conducted on two vehicular mobile network testbeds: VanLAN and DieselNet.

### 2.1 VanLAN
VanLAN is a vehicular testbed deployed on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington. It consists of eleven basestations (BSes) and two vehicles. The BSes are distributed across five buildings, as shown in Figure 1. The vehicles provide a shuttle service, moving within a speed limit of about 40 km/h and visiting the region of the BSes approximately ten times a day.

### 2.2 DieselNet
DieselNet is a vehicular testbed in Amherst, Massachusetts. It consists of vehicles equipped with a computer, an 802.11 radio, and a GPS unit. To enable trace-driven studies, one vehicle logs all beacons heard from nearby BSes. We use traces from Channels 1 and 6, each profiled for three days in December 2007, logging over 100,000 beacons. Our analysis is limited to BSes in the core of the town that are visible on all three days. There are 10 such BSes on Channel 1 and 14 on Channel 6. About half of the BSes on each channel belong to the town’s mesh network, and the rest belong to nearby shops. Our traces are available at traces.cs.umass.edu.

## 3. A Case for Diversity
This section presents a case for using basestation diversity to support vehicular WiFi clients, based on measurements from our testbeds. Client performance in this environment depends on the handoff strategy. We show that handoff strategies that use one BS at a time, as is common today, cause disruptions in connectivity that make supporting interactive applications challenging. We also show that using multiple BSes can mask these disruptions and improve application performance. These results set up our proposal for a new diversity-based handoff protocol, ViFi, which we present in the next section. To our knowledge, ours is the first study that evaluates various handoff strategies in vehicular environments.

### 3.1 Methodology
We evaluate six different handoff policies: four practical and two idealized. Our goal is to understand the fundamental differences among the policies, so we ignore the time taken to switch between BSes and the time to scan for BSes. We analyze the performance of these handoff policies using a trace-driven evaluation on VanLAN. During the evaluation, each BS and vehicle broadcasts a 500-byte packet at 1 Mbps every 100 ms. Nodes log all correctly decoded packets and beacons. Our results are based on analysis of traces collected over a two-week period.

### 3.2 Aggregate Performance Results
Figure 2 shows the number of packets delivered by the six handoff policies. As the density of BSes increases, more packets are delivered, but the relative performance of various methods is similar. AllBSes performs best, followed by BestBS, History, RSSI, and BRR; Sticky performs the worst. Ignoring Sticky, all methods are within 25% of AllBSes. This suggests that for non-interactive applications, the choice of method is not critical. However, results below demonstrate significant differences for interactive applications.

### 3.3 Uninterrupted Connectivity Results
To compare the ability of different handoff methods in providing uninterrupted connectivity, we start with a qualitative example. Figure 3 shows the behavior of BRR, BestBS, and AllBSes during one example trip of the vehicle. Each method provides adequate connectivity for roughly the same total path length, but BRR contains several regions of inadequate connectivity. BestBS has fewer interruptions because it uses the optimal BS, and AllBSes performs best by using multiple BSes to further reduce the number of interruptions.

Frequent interruptions in BRR can be explained through a detailed analysis of the connectivity between a vehicular WiFi client and a BS. Contrary to earlier studies of controlled environments [29, 17], we find that in realistic environments, this connectivity is highly variable.

## 4. ViFi Protocol
ViFi is a protocol that opportunistically exploits basestation diversity to minimize disruptions and support interactive applications for mobile clients. ViFi uses a decentralized and lightweight probabilistic algorithm for coordination among participating basestations. Basestations that opportunistically overhear a packet but not its acknowledgment, probabilistically relay the packet to the intended next hop, minimizing wasted transmissions.

We implemented and successfully deployed ViFi on our testbed in Redmond, Washington, for over two months. Our evaluation, using both the deployed prototype and simulations driven by traces from our testbed in Amherst, Massachusetts, shows that ViFi's link-layer performance is comparable to an ideal diversity-based handoff protocol and outperforms an ideal hard handoff protocol. At the same time, it uses the wireless medium as efficiently as a single-basestation handoff protocol.

We studied the performance of ViFi for two commonly used interactive applications: VoIP and short TCP transfers typical in web browsing. Based on our deployment results, we find that ViFi reduces disruptions for these applications and improves their user-perceived quality. Trace-driven simulations based on the second testbed corroborate our findings.

## 5. Conclusion
Our study demonstrates the potential of leveraging the widespread availability of WiFi to provide cost-effective connectivity for moving vehicles. By exploiting basestation diversity, ViFi significantly reduces disruptions and supports interactive applications, improving the user experience. Future work will focus on further optimizing ViFi and exploring its applicability in other vehicular networking scenarios.
