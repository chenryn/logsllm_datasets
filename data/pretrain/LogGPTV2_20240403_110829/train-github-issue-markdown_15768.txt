In #23461 I described how difficult it is to write automation around kubectl.
You want to check for errors at each stage, but you don't want the script to
be so brittle that it only works if the apiserver is up and reachable 100% of
the time. Asking users (including ourselves) to add the retry logic in the
shell does not seem correct, so I'd like to see us add retry logic (off by
default if we want) to kubectl.
