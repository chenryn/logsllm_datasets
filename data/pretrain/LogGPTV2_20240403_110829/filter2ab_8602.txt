**ATT&CK ID:** M1038  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Execution Prevention

To prevent potential misuse by adversaries, configure application control to block the execution of `wmic.exe` if it is not required for a given system or network. For example, in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and later versions, you can use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy rules to block the `wmic.exe` application and mitigate the risk of abuse.
