## Abstract
This paper explores the extension of data visualization tools to expedite the analysis of social networks. It demonstrates how a combination of data mining, named entity recognition, and visualization can quickly highlight significant social relationships. Two case studies illustrate these techniques in the context of social networking:
1. An analysis of Tony Hawk’s Twitter hunt, which unexpectedly revealed key influencers, including a member of Tony’s staff.
2. The enumeration of a 419 scam, infiltration of the scammers' social network, and exposure of deeper links to organized crime.

The focus is specifically on Twitter and Facebook, utilizing the Twitter API and publicly available profiles.

**Keywords:** social networks, visualization, data mining, Maltego.

## 1. Introduction
Social network analysis has ancient roots, with formal scientific exploration beginning in the late 1800s. Jacob Moreno, a key figure in the field, developed the sociogram, a tool for visualizing social networks (Figure 1.1).

**Figure 1.1: Example Sociogram**

While social network visualization is not new, most approaches have traditionally involved piping data from data mining into visualization engines like Vizster and UCINET (Figure 1.2). These methods, while useful, lack interactivity. Interactive data visualization bridges this gap by allowing users to perform actions on nodes, manipulate results, and conduct subsequent analyses intuitively.

## 2. Target Rich Environment
### 2.1 A Perfect Storm
In the last decade, three key factors have converged to create a "target rich environment":
- **Significant Growth of Data**: Internet traffic has grown from 5 exabytes per month in 2007 to 21 exabytes in 2010, with an expected increase to 56 exabytes by 2013. Online content has also expanded from 161 exabytes in 2006 to 988 exabytes in 2010.
- **Increased Use of Social Networking**: Major platforms like Facebook (350 million users), Twitter (100 million users), and LinkedIn (70 million users) have seen substantial growth.
- **Increased Online Promiscuity**: Despite privacy concerns, users often share personal information, leading to a "privacy paradox" where stated concerns do not match actual behavior.

### 2.2 Why Does This Perfect Storm Represent a Problem?
Aggregated data can expose previously hidden information, as seen in the 2006 AOL incident where search keywords were released, leading to the identification of individual users.

## 3. Opportunity
### 3.1 Visual Data Analysis
Visual data analysis involves graphically representing large datasets to facilitate quicker decision-making. Jim Andrus notes, "You'll notice things visually that you wouldn't see otherwise."

#### 3.1.1 Visual Analysis: Love It or Hate It
People have different learning preferences, such as visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic. Visual learners, who make up about 60-65% of the population, benefit greatly from data visualization.

#### 3.1.2 Current Approaches to Data Analysis and Visualization
Data analysis and visualization typically involve acquiring and cleaning data, performing analysis, and displaying results. Ben Fry outlines seven steps in his book "Visualizing Data":
1. Acquire
2. Parse
3. Filter
4. Mine
5. Represent
6. Refine
7. Interact

### 3.2 Named Entity Recognition (NER)
NER, or entity identification/extraction, involves parsing data to extract and classify information. For example, transforming unannotated text into annotated text with identified entities.

### 3.3 Interactive Visual Data Analysis
Interactive visual data analysis combines data visualization with the ability to perform operations on the data, enabling researchers to explore nodes and relationships within a graphical environment.

## 4. Tools
### 4.1 Table of Tools
Below is a non-exhaustive list of tools, indicating their capabilities in visualization, interactive visualization, and NER:

| Tool         | Visualization | Interactive Visualization | NER |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----|
| Processing   | Y             | Y                         | N   |
| Graphviz     | Y             | Y                         | N   |
| OpenCalais   | N             | N                         | Y   |
