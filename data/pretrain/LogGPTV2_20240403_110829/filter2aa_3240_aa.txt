Abstract
This paper describes how data visualization tools can 
be extended to speed up the analysis of social 
networks. It shows how a combination of data 
mining, named entity recognition and visualization 
can quickly draw attention to interesting social 
relationships.  Two cases studies describe these 
techniques in the context of social networking.
The first case study outlines how an analysis of 
skateboard legend Tony Hawk’s twitter hunt had an 
unexpected benefit of uncovering top talkers, 
including a member of Tony’s staff..
The second case study illustrates how these 
techniques have been used to enumerate a 419 scam, 
infiltrate the scammers social network and expose 
deeper, more sinister links to organized crime.
The focus is specifically on Twitter and Facebook, 
using the Twitter API's and publicly available 
profiles.
Keywords: social networks, visualization, data 
mining, Maltego.
1. Introduction
Social network analysis is not new, perhaps 
unsurprisingly, its origins can be traced back to the 
ancient Greeks1. However, it wasn’t until the advent 
of Gestalt psychology in the late 1800’s that the 
study of social networks started receiving formal 
scientific exploration, most notably from Jacob 
Moreno, who is widely credited as one of the 
founders of social network analysis2 and the creator 
of the sociogram3  (See Figure 1.1).
Figure 1.1: Example Sociogram4
As social network analysis is not new, neither is 
Social network visualization. However the majority 
of approaches to date have tended to follow an 
approach of piping the output of data mining into a 
visualization engine such as Vizster5 and  UCINET6 
(see Figure 1.2).
Figure 1.2: Typical approach for social network data 
visualization
While this technique is appropriate for representing 
data in a visual format, it is not interactive.  A 
suitable analogy of the limitations of this approach is 
creating a visual image of a directory structure, but 
not allowing a subsequent operation on the output 
(e.g. file and folder operations).
Interactive data visualization bridges this gap, 
allowing a user to perform an action on a node, 
manipulate the results and perform subsequent 
actions in an intuitive manner.

2. Target Rich Environment
2.1 A perfect storm 
Within the last decade, three key events have 
converged to create a perfect storm or a “target rich 
environment”.
•
Significant growth of data
•
Increased use of social networking
•
Increase online promiscuity.
2.1.1 Significant Growth of Data
According to figures  from Cisco7, monthly internet 
traffic has grown from 5 exabytes per month in 2007 
to 21 exabytes per month in 2010 and is expected to 
reach 56 exabytes per month in 2013.
A 2007 study by the IDC8  offers a slightly different 
perspective looking at the growth of online content 
(“information that is either created or captured in 
digital form and then replicated”), predicting an 
increase from 161 exabytes in 2006 to 988 exabytes 
in 2010. 
What is clear is that there is an enormous and 
growing amount of data available and a significant 
percentage of this data is personal information, such 
as photos and videos.

2.1.2 Increased use of Social Networking
If we discount email, in 2003, social network usage 
was relatively obscure. However, in 2010 social 
network usage is prevalent and isn’t limited to 
stereotypical “geeks”.
• Facebook - 350 million users9
• Twitter - 100 million users10
• Myspace - 113 million users11
• Bebo - 12.6 million users12
• Linkedin - 70 million users13
• Friendster - 115 million users14
2.1.3 Increased online promiscuity
“Online promiscuity”, refers to the practice of people 
putting more and more of their personal information 
online.
Perhaps the most noteworthy result from available 
research is a privacy paradox. Social network users 
appear to be stating that they take privacy 
seriously15 , yet these concerns are not reflected in 
their online profile settings16. So they are saying one 
thing and doing another.
From the 2005 paper “Information Revelation and 
Privacy in Online Social Networks (The Facebook 
case):
• 89% of users use their real names
• 61% of user use an identifiable image of 
themselves
Note: Whilst dated, these findings were corroborated 
in the September 2007 paper “Student Awareness of 
the Privacy Implications When Using Facebook”17 
and there is little to suggest anything has changed 
radically in the last 3 years.
It can be argued that this state has been reached 
through a pervasive “I’ve got nothing to hide” 
mentality. As Daniel J Solove states “In many 
instances, privacy is threatened not by singular 
egregious acts, but by a slow series of relatively 
minor acts”18 . i.e. A sequence of events led to the 
implicit trust that many users display in sharing 
personal information on social networks.
For this generation at least, it is likely to be too late 
to turn back the clock with regards to privacy.
2.2 Why does this perfect storm represent a 
problem?
Data alone may or may not be compelling, but when 
aggregated it can expose previously “hidden” 
information.  Perhaps the best example of this was 
the 2006 incident when AOL release a text file 
containing search keywords of over 657,000 users. 
The New York times 19 selected a particular user 
(AOL user “4417749”) and extracted all associated 
search terms, leading them to a Ms. Thelma Arnold 
from Lilburn, Georgia, USA. Search mirrors 20still 
exist for the curious.

3. Opportunity 
Clearly there is a rich vein of information in all this 
data, but for casual observers, it’s simply lost in a sea 
of noise. The following subsections describe how a 
combination of Interactive Data Visualization and 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) can greatly aid the 
analysis of data sets.
3.1 Visual Data Analysis
Visual Data Analysis is the process of graphically 
representing data (potentially huge amounts of data) 
to highlight specific information and facilitate 
quicker decision making.
“The basic idea here, is that you'll notice things 
visually that you wouldn't be able to even see 
otherwise.” Jim Andrus21
3.1.1 Visual analysis, you’ll either love it or you’ll 
hate it
In terms of how people prefer to receive information, 
Fleming22 describes types of learning modes (often 
referred to as V.A.R.K.).
•
Visual Learners – a preference for visual 
representation.
•
Auditory – speaking/listening
•
Reading/Writing
•
Kinesthetic – touch/feel
It is important to note that people are not the same, 
which often creates problems.  Perhaps you lean to 
visual but need to present to an auditory audience. 
Conversely, Auditory learners can become 
exasperated when there visual counterparts seem 
unable to retain spoken instructions, such as 
directions.
Visual learners account for roughly 60% - 65%23 of 
the population so clearly data visualization has an 
enormous target market.
3.1.2 Current approaches to data analysis and 
visualization
Approaches to data analysis and visualization 
broadly follow the approach of acquiring and 
cleaning a data set, performing analysis and 
displaying the results.  
Ben Fry identifies  7 steps in data visualization in his 
book “Visualizing Data”24. 
1.
Acquire
2.
Parse
3.
Filter
4.
Mine
5.
Represent
6.
Refine
7.
Interact
It is noted that the sequence and selection of these 
steps can vary dependent on the application/problem 
the researcher is trying to solve.

3.2 Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER), also referred to as 
entity identification/extraction25 is the process of 
parsing data to extract and classify information.
From wikipedia (as of 17-June-2010)
“Most research on NER systems has been 
structured as taking an unannotated block of text, 
such as this one:
Jim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006. 
And producing an annotated block of text, such as 
this one:
Jim bought 300 
shares of Acme 
Corp. in 2006”. 
3.3 Interactive Visual Data Analysis
Interactive Visual Data Analysis combines data 
visualization with the ability to perform an operation 
on the data. 
“An interaction technique is the fusion of input and 
output, consisting of all software and hardware 
elements, that provides a way for the user to 
accomplish a task”26.
Making the representation of data interactive enables 
a researcher to quickly explore interesting nodes and 
relationships within the graphical environment, 
instantly “seeing” results.
