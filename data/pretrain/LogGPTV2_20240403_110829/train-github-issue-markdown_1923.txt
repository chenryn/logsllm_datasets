I am trying to build go on IPv6 only machine and seeing following error:  
\--- FAIL: TestDialTimeout (0.01s)  
dial_test.go:108: got error "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:61521: connection reset by
peer"; not a timeout  
\--- FAIL: TestIPv4MulticastListener (0.00s)  
multicast_test.go:55: First ListenMulticastUDP on failed: listen udp
224.0.0.254: setsockopt: no such device  
FAIL  
FAIL net 2.086s
Test should check if IPv4/IPv6 addresses assigned on the machine before
starting test.
