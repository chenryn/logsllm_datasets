I am attempting to build Go on an IPv6-only machine and encountering the following errors:

```
--- FAIL: TestDialTimeout (0.01s)
dial_test.go:108: got error "dial tcp 127.0.0.1:61521: connection reset by peer"; not a timeout
--- FAIL: TestIPv4MulticastListener (0.00s)
multicast_test.go:55: First ListenMulticastUDP on failed: listen udp 224.0.0.254: setsockopt: no such device
FAIL
FAIL net 2.086s
```

It appears that the tests are failing because they are attempting to use IPv4 addresses, which are not available on this IPv6-only machine. The tests should be updated to check whether IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are assigned to the machine before proceeding.
