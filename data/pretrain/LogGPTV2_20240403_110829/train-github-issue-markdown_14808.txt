React version: 17.2
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. Using a class component, if a click event changes some state, which renders a new component, and the new component adds an event listener on its `componentDidMount` checking for clicks, the new component will trigger that event
Link to code example:

(this does not happen if the created component uses hooks to add its event
listener)
## The current behavior
A state change via a click that causes a new component to be rendered, that
new component can pick up the original click event that created it, which
seems like its reaching back in time, to so speak.
## The expected behavior
Perhaps this is now intended behavior with the react 17 event changes
(although it doesn't happen if I add the event listener with a hook on a
functional component, but I would expect that if a click event causes a
render, and the listener is added on the `componentDidMount` function, I would
assume the "click" is complete, and wouldn't be detected.
