### Problem Summary

You have installed a FreeIPA server on the host 'SRV' and a client on 'CLT'. After adding a user 'X' via the FreeIPA Web UI, you encountered a "Permission denied, please try again" error when trying to SSH as 'X' to 'CLT'. The `/var/log/messages` log on the client shows a "Decrypt integrity check failed" error. Resetting the password multiple times did not resolve the issue.

### Potential Causes

1. **Incorrect Password**: If the password does not match the keys for the principal in the KDC (Key Distribution Center), this error can occur.
2. **Outdated Keytab**: The keytab on the server may be out of sync with the KDC. This can happen if the keys for the SSH service principal have been updated in the KDC but the keytab has not been refreshed.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue

#### 1. Identify the Authentication Method
- **Password Authentication**: You are typing in your password.
- **Kerberos Ticket-Based Authentication**: You are using `gssapi-with-mic` or `gssapi-keyex`.

If you are using Kerberos ticket-based authentication, the keytab is crucial. If you are using password authentication, the keytab is still important because the server uses it to authenticate with the KDC.

#### 2. Verify the Keytab on the Server
The keytab on the client (`/etc/krb5.keytab`) is not relevant in this scenario. The keytab on the server (`/etc/krb5.keytab`) needs to be checked and potentially reset.

#### 3. Check the Keytab Contents
Use the `klist -ek /etc/krb5.keytab` command to view the current contents of the keytab on the server. Look for the SSH service principal, which should be in the form `host/hostname@REALM`.

```sh
$ sudo klist -ek /etc/krb5.keytab
KVNO Principal
---- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1 host/SRV.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM (AES-256 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC)
```

#### 4. Update the Keytab
To update the keytab, use the `ipa-getkeytab` command to extract the current keys for the SSH service principal into a new keytab file.

```sh
$ ipa-getkeytab -s SRV -p host/CLT.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM -k /etc/krb5.keytab
```

Replace `SRV` with the hostname of your FreeIPA server, `CLT.example.com` with the hostname of your client, and `EXAMPLE.COM` with your realm.

#### 5. Verify the New Keytab
Check the contents of the new keytab to ensure the keys have been updated.

```sh
$ sudo klist -ek /etc/krb5.keytab
KVNO Principal
---- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   2 host/CLT.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM (AES-256 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC)
```

If the key version numbers (KVNO) differ, it indicates that the keytab has been successfully updated.

#### 6. Test SSH Access
After updating the keytab, try to SSH as user 'X' to 'CLT' again.

```sh
$ ssh X@CLT.example.com
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Unprovisioning the Client**: It is generally not necessary to unprovision the client from the FreeIPA inventory unless you suspect deeper configuration issues. Unprovisioning and reprovisioning the client should be a last resort.
- **Backup Keytabs**: Before making changes, it is a good practice to back up the existing keytab files.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "Permission denied" and "Decrypt integrity check failed" errors.
