I am trying to use the bootstrap modal feature, but get a little bug on
toggling the modal on.
This problem exists also on bootstrap 3 documentation page:
http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
If you click on the button to open modal, you can see the background position
changing by approximately 1 cm to the left.
Tested on latest Safari & Chrome.
Thanks in advance.
