User: I am trying to come out with a small python script to monitor the battery state of my ubuntu laptop and sound alerts if it's not charging as well as do other stuff (such as suspend etc).
I really don't know where to start, and would like to know if there is any library for python i can use.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Assistant: You do not need to use any module for this. 
Simply you can navigate to
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0.
Here you will find a lot of files with information about your battery. 
You will get current charge in charge_now file and total charge in charge_full file. 
Then you can calculate battery percentage by using some math.
Note:- You may need root access for this. You can use sudo nautilus command to open directories in root mode.
