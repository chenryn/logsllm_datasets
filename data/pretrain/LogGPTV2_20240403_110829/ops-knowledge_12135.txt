User: For some reason I messed up my install in python a while ago and I recently tried to repair the install but I am getting an error saying: "The specified account already exists." I then decided to rerun the install package and instead of repairing it decided to delete python so I clicked uninstall and got the error message saying: "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program required for this install to complete could not be run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor." The only package I installed (if it is a package) was VPython and for some reason that does not open whenever I try opening it so I assumed I messed up the download for that also. I decided to go ahead and delete everything in my C directory that had the keyword Python including the Python27 folder but it still gave me the same error.
Assistant: I can confirm that this works.  Use Ccleaner to fix the registry, then use installer to "Repair" 2.7.10 the installation, then use installer to "Remove" the installation.
