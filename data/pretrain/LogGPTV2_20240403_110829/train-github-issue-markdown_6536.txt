  * TensorFlow version: 1.12.0
  * Python version: 3.6
  * Installed using virtualenv? pip? conda?: conda
  * Bazel version (if compiling from source): 0.22.0

  * GPU model and memory: RTX 2080
**Describe the problem**
I installed the everything and ran the tests for cuda and cudnn that were said
from and they both passed normally. Running small tests with tensorflow also
worked, i.e. a linear regression model. However, I was trying to run a file
using keras and doing a more complicated model and it threw errors when it
started running an individual epoch. I also just ran the code with only a
small portion of the images.
    I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:161] successfully opened CUDA library libcudnn.so.7 locally
    E tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_dnn.cc:482] Could not create cudnn handle: CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR

    tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.UnknownError: Failed to get convolution algorithm. This is probably because cuDNN failed to initialize, so try looking to see if a warning log message was printed above.

Running the code normally with tensorflow works fine, only the gpu version is
failing. I tried both building it from source and using tf-nightly-gpu.
