Intersections. Intersection occurs when two line segments
in the pattern cross each other. For instance, the 3X3 pat-
tern 152436 depicted in Figure 3a has 3 intersections, the
ﬁrst between 1 → 5 and 2 → 4, the second between 1 → 5
and 4 → 3, and the third between 5 → 2 and 4 → 3. Simi-
larly, the Pass-O pattern 148263 has 5 intersections.

Theorem 3. In a Pass-O with n nodes, the average num-
ber of intersections is n2−7n+13
The proof is given in appendix B. The average number of
intersections in the 9-node Pass-O is thus 92−7·9+13
= 5.167.
This also matches with µ = 5.16 as computed by our code
(Table 1). Note that 3X3 patterns have only 2.22 intersec-
tions on an average.
Remark 1. Theoretically, Pass-O not only provides a large
search space but also the patterns drawn on Pass-O are uni-
form and visually more complex in terms of intersections.

4. USER STUDY
The primary objective of our study was to quantify the se-
curity of human-generated 3X3 and Pass-O patterns against
both guessing and shoulder-surﬁng attacks. To provide a
reliable estimate of the pattern security, we sought a large
sample size. However, we note that collecting a large amount
of graphical patterns from a diverse set of users is a chal-
lenging task.
In case of textual passwords, the breach of
large-scale websites is a common event which presents re-
searchers with an unique opportunity to analyse millions of
password strings [3]. In contrast, since graphical patterns
are mostly used to protect personal mobile devices, survey
methodology seems to be the only way to study them. This
method limits the number of patterns that can be collected.
In fact, prior survey studies [6, 13] performed security anal-
ysis on a small number of patterns gathered from not more
than 100 participants per condition.
To be able to perform a large-scale analysis of 3X3 and
Pass-O patterns, we conducted a web-based user study in
our organization. Since the organization is large and spread
across multiple locations around the globe, conventional meth-
ods e.g., pen and paper survey [6, 13] would have required
tremendous amount of resources. On the other hand, us-
ing the web-based study we were able to gather more than
1,23,000 patterns from 21,053 participants within two weeks.
4.1 Methodology
We created a website speciﬁcally for the study and made it
accessible to all employees through an internal portal. This
portal is used for many purposes and employees already had
the credentials to access it. On visiting the study link, par-
ticipants were shown both conditions, 3X3 and Pass-O, but
they were allowed to participate in only one of them. After
choosing the condition, participants were redirected to an
appropriate page containing instructions for drawing pat-
terns on the chosen layout. The competition ran for two
weeks and participants could participate only once.
402To attract more participants, we designed an adversarial
game as described in [6, 13]. More speciﬁcally, participants
were asked to draw at most 3 distinct secret patterns which
they think are easy for them to remember but diﬃcult for
others to guess. These are called defensive patterns. Further,
participants were asked to draw at most 3 distinct pattern
guesses which they think are being used as secret (defensive)
by other participants. These are called oﬀensive patterns.
The purpose of the competition was two-fold, i) to learn
the common pattern choices of participants, ii) to use these
learnings in educating participants about insecure choices.
After the competition, we published a list of top 500 popular
3X3 and Pass-O patterns [1] to make participants aware of
the insecure patterns that should ideally never be used.
Since paying a large number of participants costs more
money, we awarded top 3 participants in each condition with
a cash reward of $300. Participants were assigned a score
based on the guessability (strength) of their defensive pat-
terns and the guessing eﬃciency of their oﬀensive patterns
(zero-sum game). At the end of the game, we displayed a
dashboard wherein each participant can view their score and
their position (rank) with respect to other participants. We
believe that the adversarial nature of the game and a large
cash reward provided enough incentive for participants to
choose strong defensive patterns in both 3X3 and Pass-O
conditions.
Our organization does not fall under the jurisdiction of
an IRB, but we did abide by the privacy laws and did not
collect any data about participants. However, for research
purpose, we requested the cumulative demographic data of
participants from the Chief Security Oﬃcer of our organiza-
tion.
4.2 Participants
11,960 employees participated in 3X3 condition and 9,093
in Pass-O condition (total 21,053). Participants in 3X3 con-
dition provided 34,548 defensive and 35,249 oﬀensive pat-
terns (total 69,797). While participants in Pass-O condition
provided 26,469 defensive and 26,914 oﬀensive patterns (to-
tal 53,383). We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between gen-
der, age, qualiﬁcation and nationality of participants in 3X3
and Pass-O conditions (chi-square test). Most participants
were young and were in the age group of 20-30 (Table 2).
Qualiﬁcation-wise participants were quite diverse. Further,
participants belonged to 43 diﬀerent nationalities, however,
more than 93% of participants belonged to nationality N1.

4.3 Limitations
Due to the web-based nature of the study, we were not
in a position to verify whether participants stored their pat-
terns for later use during the recall phase. Hence, we could
not measure memorability in our study. Consequently, this
experiment has to be treated as an initial security study of
3X3 and Pass-O patterns. Further, the generalizability of
our study results is limited as the sample is not representa-
tive of a larger population. The population is younger and
more technical than the overall population. However, the
data analysis reveals striking similarity between the statis-
tics of patterns from our study and pattern data reported in
the past [5, 6, 13]. In fact, we found that the security of 3X3
patterns is less than that reported in these earlier studies.
5. DATA ANALYSIS
Now, we analyse the collected data and present empir-
ical results. To determine the shoulder-surﬁng resistance,
we use pattern characteristics such as pattern length, stroke
length, direction changes and intersections [4, 10, 11] and to
determine guessability we look at the common start and end
points, popular patterns and repetitions [6,13]. Due to space
constraints, we combine defensive and oﬀensive patterns into
a single list as done in [6,13] and compare the characteristics
of all 69,797 3X3 patterns and 53,383 Pass-O patterns.
Pattern Length. Figure 4a shows the lengthwise distri-
bution of user-chosen 3X3 and Pass-O patterns. 53.74% of
the Pass-O patterns are connected using 9 nodes while only
26.30% of 3X3 patterns have 9 connected nodes. Surpris-
ingly, the number of Pass-O patterns with length 7 and 8 is
smaller. However, due to the preference for longer patterns,
the average number of nodes connected in Pass-O patterns
(7.46) is larger than that in 3X3 patterns (6.92).
Stroke Length. Theoretically, the average stroke length
of 3X3 patterns is larger than Pass-O patterns. However,
the survey data reveals that not only 3X3 patterns are con-
nected with fewer nodes, the line segments used in connect-
ing them are also short. Figure 4b presents the stroke length
distribution of 3X3 and Pass-O patterns. More than 71% of
3X3 patterns are composed using straight and short diag-
onal moves only. The line segments such as knight moves
which resist shoulder-surﬁng attacks [4, 10, 11] are mostly
absent in 3X3 patterns while more than 84% of Pass-O pat-
terns are connected with longer line segments (Figure 4c).
Consequently, the average stroke length of Pass-O patterns
(8.57) is longer than 3X3 patterns (7.20).
Intersections. As shown in Figure 4d more than 76% of
3X3 patterns are simple and do not contain any intersec-
tions, a property which contributes towards the pattern com-
plexity [4, 10, 11]. On the other hand, nearly 60% of Pass-O
patterns have at least one intersection. 3X3 patterns contain
only 0.63 intersections on an average while Pass-O patterns
is drawn with 3.47 intersections (Table 3). Therefore, Pass-
O patterns appear more complex than 3X3 patterns. We
compare the shoulder-surﬁng resistance of 3X3 and Pass-O
patterns in appendix C.
