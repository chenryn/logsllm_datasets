### User Performance Analysis

As shown in **Figure 5(b)**, the differences in user performance were relatively small but statistically significant. Interestingly, users with higher educational levels or more extensive computing backgrounds performed worse. While the exact reason is unclear, one plausible explanation is that these users may have been overly confident in their knowledge and skills, leading them to overlook IDNs. Future research could delve deeper into this phenomenon.

### Limitations of the User Study

Our user study has several limitations:
1. **Online Conduct via MTurk**: Conducting the study online via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) poses inherent challenges, as we cannot ensure that participants always pay full attention to the questions. However, recent studies indicate that MTurk workers are at least as attentive as traditional subject pool participants [23]. We also included attention-check questions to mitigate this concern. Future work could employ eye-tracking technology to further address this limitation.
2. **Non-Interactive Setup**: Our study setup involved showing screenshots of target websites, which prevented participants from interacting with the actual websites. This non-interactive approach helped protect users and allowed us to focus on domain names. We reminded participants to pay attention to domain names, but in real-world scenarios, users might make more mistakes if not prompted. Even with these reminders, participants still struggled to identify a significant percentage of homograph IDNs, suggesting the need for additional countermeasures.
3. **Scope of the Study**: Our user study focused solely on the perception of website authenticity (domain names), which is just the first step in web phishing. Future research could explore how IDNs influence follow-up actions, such as login attempts.

### Discussion

#### IDN Homograph in Email and Social Network Services

Email systems and social network platforms are also common channels for disseminating phishing messages. We briefly investigated popular email and social network services regarding their IDN policies. Our overall observation was that most services lacked effective IDN policies. Due to space constraints, we summarize our key findings:

- **Email Services**: We tested Gmail, iCloud, and Outlook as of May 2020. We registered three IDNs to test their display in email clients:
  - **y©úzåôìß⇥r.com**: A legitimate IDN used to check if email clients support IDNs.
  - **goog¯ıe.com**: An IDN impersonating "google.com" that can bypass browser defenses.
  - **þaidu.com**: An IDN impersonating "baidu.com" that can be detected by browser policies (e.g., Chrome).

  For email clients that supported IDNs, we found that homograph IDNs were consistently displayed in Unicode. For example, Gmail (web and mobile) and iCloud (mobile) displayed homograph IDNs in Unicode in the sender's email address. This suggests that attackers can use homograph IDNs to impersonate trusted senders, even if the IDNs are blocked by web browsers.

- **Social Network Applications**: We tested Facebook, Twitter, Messenger, iMessage, and WhatsApp with homograph IDN URLs impersonating popular brands. Almost all platforms displayed homograph IDNs in Unicode, except Facebook, which displayed Punycode. This indicates that most social network applications lack effective IDN defense policies.

#### Intent of IDN Homograph

Our measurements show that homograph IDNs exist in practice and can bypass browser-level defenses. We did not analyze the intent behind homograph IDN registrations, as browser policies focus on impersonation behavior rather than intent. Prior studies suggest that many homograph IDNs are registered by opportunistic domain squatters who aim to sell the domain name to the target brand for profit [37]. There is also evidence that homograph IDNs are frequently used for phishing and abuse [15, 37, 54]. A more in-depth analysis of registrants' intent is left for future work.

#### Countermeasures

Our results highlight the need to improve defenses against homograph IDNs. We discuss potential strategies from two perspectives: homograph IDN detection and user warnings.

- **Homograph IDN Detection**: One approach is to add new rules to address the failure cases identified in our experiments. For example, browsers like Chrome can expand the list of target domains, use a more comprehensive confusable table, and increase the number of prohibited Unicode blocks. However, it is challenging to ensure completeness, especially given the need for real-time decisions. Improving the scalability of skeleton matching and carefully assessing the impact on legitimate IDNs are open challenges for future work.
- **User Warnings**: Communicating detection decisions to end users is crucial. For instance, Chrome shows a warning page asking, "Did you mean [the real domain name]?" with an explanation. Such warnings are not yet available in other browsers. Future research could examine the effectiveness of these warnings and explore design improvements. Accurate detection methods are essential, as missed detections can prevent the triggering of warning pages.
- **Disabling IDNs by Default**: Browsers could take a more extreme approach by disabling IDNs by default. Users who benefit from IDN support (e.g., those speaking certain languages) could be prompted to enable IDN support for a specific set of related Unicode scripts.

### Responsible Disclosure

We have reported our findings to the security teams of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Microsoft IE, which uses Chromium, is also covered. Chrome and Firefox have started investigating and addressing the reported issues, while Safari’s team has not responded.

### Related Work

#### Domain Squatting

Domain squatting involves registering internet domains with names similar to existing brands and trademarks. Most domain squatting activities are driven by profit, with some squatting domains used for phishing or distributing malware [21, 47, 64]. Techniques include typo squatting, bit squatting, and combo-squatting. Another strategy is to register look-alike domain names under newly released top-level domains (TLDs) [20, 21, 30, 52]. Recent work has shown that such impersonation also occurs in TLS certificates [58]. Our work focuses on IDN homographs, a form of web homograph via character substitution [25].

#### IDN Homograph

Prior works have conducted empirical measurements of IDN homographs, finding that many IDNs are owned by domain squatters [35, 37], while some are used for phishing and abuse [15, 37, 54]. A related project showed that most users lack knowledge about internationalized domain names [8], making IDNs deceptive. Our work provides a detailed analysis of browser-level defenses and identifies weaknesses in current IDN policies.

#### Phishing

Our work is related to the broader topic of phishing. Many studies have examined phishing emails and various detection methods [12, 14, 16, 26, 40, 53, 67]. Unlike generic spam, phishing emails can be highly targeted and difficult to detect [24]. Attackers often spoof trusted domain names or use squatting domains [7, 27, 31, 33]. Our work is more closely related to phishing websites, which are typically the landing pages of URLs in phishing emails [11, 22, 48, 50, 51, 68, 71–73]. A recent project explored the end-to-end lifecycle of phishing attacks by analyzing phishing URLs, websites, and emails [49].

#### Security Indicators on URLs

Researchers have studied how users perceive and react to different URL presentations in browsers. Most studies have reported negative results, such as the limited impact of HTTPS Extended Validation (EV) certificates on user behavior [63] and the limited effectiveness of domain name highlighting in warning users about malicious URLs [13, 36]. A related project examined how different URL obfuscation methods, including IDN homographs, affect users' ability to judge URL authenticity [57]. Our user study further examines the differences in users' perceptions of homograph IDNs blocked by browsers and those that can bypass existing defenses, highlighting the need to improve IDN homograph detection.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of browsers' defense policies against IDN homographs. Using over 9,000 testing cases, we measured the effectiveness of IDN policies in existing web and mobile browsers and their historical versions from 2015 to 2020. Our results show that current browser IDN policies are not yet effective in detecting homograph IDNs. Our user studies demonstrate that homograph IDNs that bypass browser defenses remain highly deceptive to users. Overall, our findings underscore the need to improve defense policies.
