## Abstract
Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to many Internet systems and applications, where a single adversary inserts multiple colluding identities to compromise security and privacy. Recent research has advocated the use of social-network-based trust relationships to defend against Sybil attacks. However, most prior security analyses of such systems focus on a static snapshot of the social network. In reality, social network connections change over time, and attackers can also cause limited changes to the network. This work examines the temporal dynamics of various social-network-based Sybil defenses.

We describe and analyze novel attacks that leverage:
1. The attacker's ability to modify Sybil-controlled parts of the social network.
2. The attacker's ability to change the connections between Sybil identities and honest users.
3. The natural dynamics of connections forming and breaking in the honest part of the social network.

Our findings show that some fully distributed defenses, such as SybilLimit and Persea, are vulnerable to dramatic gains by the attacker over time, significantly undermining system security. Even centrally controlled defenses like SybilInfer and SybilRank can be evaded, or used to create denial-of-service conditions (e.g., Ostra and SumUp). Through analysis and simulation using both synthetic and real-world social network topologies, we propose possible defense strategies and discuss the trade-offs. Our results highlight the critical need to account for temporal dynamics in Sybil defense to prevent unexpected and potentially dangerous attacks.

## 1. Introduction
In December 2011, a political protest on Twitter was swamped by spam from thousands of bot accounts [14, 22]. Similarly, the Tor anonymity network was infiltrated by a botnet in 2010, resulting in 25% compromised relays [1, 2], and more recent attacks have involved man-in-the-middle attempts [32]. These incidents exemplify Sybil attacks, where a single entity controls multiple identities to compromise system security and privacy. Sybil attacks are particularly concerning for distributed systems, which lack a central authority to vet identities and perform admission control. Many such systems assume a bound on the fraction of malicious identities for correct operation. For example, Byzantine consensus protocols, quorum-based systems, reputation systems, and distributed hash tables are designed to tolerate only a bounded number of malicious identities. However, even centralized systems, such as Twitter, face serious challenges with Sybil attacks [34, 23].

A key approach to defending against Sybil attacks is to use social-network-based trust relationships [36, 35, 8, 15, 18, 4, 19, 26, 27, 16]. The core insight is that it is difficult for an adversary to establish trust relationships with honest users, especially when user interactions are used to infer strong social ties [11, 31] (see Section 2). Various mechanisms translate a bound on the number of attack edges into a bound on the number of malicious Sybil identities. For instance, SybilLimit [35], a well-known distributed Sybil defense, claims that an adversary cannot insert more than \( g \cdot w \) Sybil identities, where \( g \) is the number of attack edges and \( w \) is the mixing time of the social network.

While most Sybil defense mechanisms have been analyzed theoretically or experimentally on synthetic or real data, they have been developed and evaluated assuming a static social network. Social networks, however, are constantly evolving, with new relationships forming and old ones fading [13], particularly in interaction-based networks crucial for strong Sybil defense [31]. Attackers are not limited to a single point in time and may improve their effectiveness with persistent effort. The temporal dynamics of Sybil defense systems have received little attention, making it unclear whether these defenses provide long-term security guarantees.

### Contributions
In this paper, we address the issue of temporal dynamics in Sybil defense systems and their impact on security. We investigate:
- The types of temporal dynamics in social networks and Sybil defense systems.
- Possible attacks leveraging these temporal dynamics and their effectiveness.
- Defense mechanisms that account for or leverage temporal dynamics to prevent such attacks.

We identify three main temporal aspects relevant to Sybil defense:
1. Churn among Sybil identities, where the attacker replaces some identities with others.
2. Churn in attack edges, where the attacker changes which honest users he targets for creating an attack edge.
3. Churn among the honest users in the social network.

We propose a general attack model that leverages these temporal dynamics and identify potential attacks on previously published Sybil defense systems. We examine a new attack on SybilLimit based on churn in Sybil identities, called the counter elevation attack, which reduces the effectiveness of a key defense mechanism. We also examine attacks based on churn in attack edges, including attacks on SybilInfer [8], SybilRank [7], and a powerful attack that undermines the effectiveness of the Persea Sybil-resistant DHT [4]. Additionally, we explore how the Ostra [16] and SumUp [27] systems can be exploited by attackers to conduct denial-of-service attacks through churn in Sybil identities.

Finally, we discuss possible countermeasures to these attacks. While careful design may mitigate some issues, developing theoretically backed defenses that explicitly address temporal attacks remains an important open problem for future work.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1 Sybil Attack Problem
Consider a social network topology \( G = (V, E) \), comprising a set \( V \) of nodes and a set \( E \) of edges. Each node \( v \in V \) represents an identity, and each edge \( (u, v) \in E \) denotes a relationship between two identities \( u \) and \( v \). We only consider mutual relationships; hence, \( G \) is an undirected graph, and an edge exists in \( G \) only if both nodes on that edge trust each other (bidirectional trust).

Every node \( v \in V \) in the network represents either an honest (benign) user or a Sybil (malicious) identity. Let \( n \) be the number of honest nodes in \( G \), and let \( m \) be the number of edges between honest nodes.

Figure 1 illustrates the Sybil attack problem in social networks, where an adversary can create an unlimited number of Sybil nodes and set up edges between them arbitrarily. We denote the subnetwork comprising all honest nodes as the honest region, the subnetwork comprising all Sybil nodes as the Sybil region, and the edges connecting the honest region and Sybil region as the attack edges. Let \( g \) be the number of attack edges.

### 2.2 Social Sybil Defenses
Research has explored the use of social trust relationships to mitigate Sybil attacks [36, 35, 8, 7, 4, 16, 27]. These defenses rely on the insight that it is costly for an adversary to set up trust relationships with honest users (i.e., attack edges). They use various graph-theoretic techniques to bound the number or influence of Sybil identities in proportion to the number of attack edges. For example, SybilLimit [35] guarantees that an adversary with \( g \) attack edges can insert about \( g \cdot w \) Sybil identities, where \( w \) is the mixing time of the honest social network.

Despite differences in proposed mechanisms, researchers have shown that they rely on identifying local communities around a trust node [29].

#### Trust Assumptions
Social Sybil defenses often employ two key assumptions:
1. The honest region is fast-mixing, implying a well-connected, giant community structure of honest users.
2. The social network is a strong trust network, where the number of attack edges is relatively small [29].

Prior work has shown that these assumptions oversimplify reality. Mohaisen et al. [20] measured the mixing time of real-world social graphs and found that the actual mixing time is longer than the theoretical value anticipated by researchers. This is due to the presence of multiple small communities in real-world social networks. Recent work has also questioned the assumption that it is costly for an attacker to set up trust relationships with honest users in current online social networks [31, 6, 12]. Yang et al. showed that the number of attack edges may not be bounded if the underlying social network does not have strong trust, as seen in RenRen, the largest social networking platform in China [34]. Ghosh et al. [10] demonstrated that link farming is widespread on Twitter, with a majority of attack edges farmed from a small fraction of users. These findings highlight that relying on friendship links in current online social networks is insufficient.

We note that a large number of attack edges and a longer mixing time would degrade the security guarantees offered by these systems (e.g., linearly with mixing time for SybilLimit), but not render them inapplicable. To strengthen defenses against weak social links, prior work has proposed:
- Using user interactions to extract strong real-world trust relationships that cannot be manipulated at scale by an adversary [11, 31].
- Explicitly asking users to identify their most trusted social contacts [30].

## 3. Overview of Temporal Attacks
Temporal attacks against Sybil defenses exploit the dynamics of the underlying social network. Such attacks are typically long-term, incrementally exploiting vulnerabilities as the system evolves.

### 3.1 Temporal Attack Taxonomy
Based on the type of dynamic exploited, we categorize temporal attacks into three categories:
1. **Attacks based on exploiting churn in the Sybil region:**
   - The attacker has complete control over identities in the Sybil region and the edges among them (Sybil edges).
   - The attacker can induce churn by deleting existing Sybil identities and introducing new ones, or by creating and deleting Sybil edges.
   - A subclass of these attacks, called re-registration attacks, ensures the number of Sybil identities remains below the detection threshold.

2. **Attacks based on exploiting churn in the attack edges:**
   - The attacker can change which honest users they target for creating attack edges.
   - This can be used to undermine defenses like SybilInfer [8], SybilRank [7], and the Persea Sybil-resistant DHT [4].

3. **Attacks based on exploiting churn in the honest social region:**
   - The natural dynamics of connections forming and breaking in the honest part of the social network can be exploited.
   - This can lead to denial-of-service conditions in systems like Ostra [16] and SumUp [27].

These attacks can compound to effectively compromise system security.
