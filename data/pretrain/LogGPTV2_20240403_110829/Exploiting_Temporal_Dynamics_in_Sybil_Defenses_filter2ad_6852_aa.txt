Abstract
Sybil attacks present a signiﬁcant threat to many Internet
systems and applications, in which a single adversary in-
serts multiple colluding identities in the system to compro-
mise its security and privacy. Recent work has advocated
the use of social-network-based trust relationships to defend
against Sybil attacks. However, most of the prior security
analyses of such systems examine only the case of social net-
works at a single instant in time. In practice, social network
connections change over time, and attackers can also cause
limited changes to the networks. In this work, we focus on
the temporal dynamics of a variety of social-network-based
Sybil defenses. We describe and examine the eﬀect of novel
attacks based on: (a) the attacker’s ability to modify Sybil-
controlled parts of the social-network graph, (b) his ability
to change the connections that his Sybil identities main-
tain to honest users, and (c) taking advantage of the regular
dynamics of connections forming and breaking in the hon-
est part of the social network. We ﬁnd that against some
defenses meant to be fully distributed, such as SybilLimit
and Persea, the attacker can make dramatic gains over time
and greatly undermine the security guarantees of the sys-
tem. Even against centrally controlled Sybil defenses, the
attacker can eventually evade detection (e.g. against Sybil-
Infer and SybilRank) or create denial-of-service conditions
(e.g. against Ostra and SumUp). After analysis and simula-
tion of these attacks using both synthetic and real-world so-
cial network topologies, we describe possible defense strate-
gies and the trade-oﬀs that should be explored. It is clear
from our ﬁndings that temporal dynamics need to be ac-
counted for in Sybil defense or else the attacker will be able
to undermine the system in unexpected and possibly dan-
gerous ways.

INTRODUCTION
In December of 2011, a political protest by Russian citi-
zens on the Twitter social network was swamped by spam
from thousands of bot accounts [14, 22]. Similarly, the Tor
anonymity network was inﬁltrated by a botnet in 2010 that
resulted in 25% compromised relays [1, 2], and more recent
attacks have been reported in which multiple relays, appar-
ently controlled by a single entity, attempted man-in-the-
middle attacks on users [32]. These incidents are examples of
Sybil attacks, in which a single entity controls many diﬀerent
identities so as to overcome security mechanisms and attack
the system and its users [9]. Sybil attacks are a particular
concern for distributed systems, which lack a central author-
ity to vet identities and perform admission control. Many of
these designs assume a bound on the fraction of malicious
identities in the system for correct operations. For example,
byzantine consensus protocols, quorum-based systems, rep-
utation systems and distributed hash tables are designed to
tolerate only a bounded number of malicious identities. The
Twitter example, however, along with many other cases of
Sybil identities on online social networks [34, 23], shows that
even centralized systems have serious challenges with such
attacks.
An important thread of research proposes to defend against
Sybil attacks using social-network-based trust relationships
[36, 35, 8, 15, 18, 4, 19, 26, 27, 16]. The key insight in these
defenses is that it is hard for an adversary to set up trust
relationships with honest users (called attack edges), partic-
ularly when user interactions are used to infer strong social
ties [11, 31] (see Section 2). Using a wide range of mecha-
nisms, a bound on the number of attack edges is translated
into a bound on the number of malicious Sybil identities that
an adversary can insert in the system. For example, Sybil-
Limit [35], a well-known distributed Sybil defense, oﬀers a
proof of security based on this assumption. Given g attack
edges between honest users and an adversary, SybilLimit
claims that an adversary cannot insert more than g· w Sybil
identities, where w is the mixing time of the social network.
805While most Sybil defense mechanisms in the literature
have been analyzed theoretically or using experiments on
synthetic or real data, they have all been developed and
evaluated from the perspective of a static social network, in
which the trust relationships are established and unchang-
ing. Social networks, however, are constantly evolving as
new relationships are formed and others fade out [13], partic-
ularly when using the more dynamic interaction-based net-
works that are critical for strong Sybil defense [31]. Further,
attackers are not limited to attacking a system at a single
point in time and may be able to improve an attack’s ef-
fectiveness with persistent eﬀort. These temporal dynamics
of Sybil defense systems have received very little attention
in the research community, and it is thus unclear whether
Sybil defenses provide any security guarantees over time.
Contributions:
In this paper, we begin to address this issue by investi-
gating the temporal dimension of Sybil defense systems and
its impact on system security. In particular, we examine the
following questions:
• What kinds of temporal dynamics do social networks
and Sybil defense systems have?
• What are the possible attacks that leverage these tem-
poral dynamics and how eﬀective are they?
• What defense mechanisms that account for temporal
dynamics, or even leverage them, could be used to pre-
vent these attacks?
We identify three main temporal aspects of social net-
works that are relevant to Sybil defense: (a) churn among
the Sybil identities, in which the attacker replaces some iden-
tities with others; (b) churn in attack edges, in which the
attacker changes which honest users he targets for creating
an attack edge; and (c) churn among the honest users in the
social network.
We propose a general attack model that leverages these
temporal dynamics, and identify a number of possible at-
tacks on previously published Sybil defense systems. We
ﬁrst examine a new attack on SybilLimit [35] based on churn
in Sybil identities–the counter elevation attack –that greatly
reduces the eﬀectiveness of a key defense mechanism, a set
of counters used to track who is validating whom. We then
examine attacks based on churn in attack edges, including
attacks on SybilInfer [8], SybilRank [7], and a powerful at-
tack that undermines the eﬀectiveness of the Persea Sybil-
resistant DHT [4]. Third, we examine how the Ostra [16]
and SumUp [27] systems can be leveraged by attackers to
conduct denial-of-service attacks when the attacker creates
churn in the Sybil identities.
Finally, we discuss possible countermeasures to these at-
tacks. While careful design may overcome some of the is-
sues that we explore in this paper, developing theoretically
backed defenses that explicitly address our temporal attacks
remains an important open problem for future work.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
2.1 Sybil Attack Problem
Consider a social network topology G = (V, E), compris-
ing a set V of nodes with a set E of edges. In the network
topology, a node v ∈ V denotes an identity, and an edge
Figure 1: Sybil attack problem.
(u, v) ∈ E denotes a relationship between two identities u
and v. We only consider mutual relationships; hence G is
an undirected graph, and an edge exists in G only if both
nodes on that edge trust each other (bidirectional trust).
Every node v ∈ V in the network represents either an hon-
est (benign) user or a Sybil (malicious) identity. We denote
n to be the number of honest nodes in G, and denote m to
be the number of edges between honest nodes.
Figure 1 depicts the Sybil attack problem in social net-
works, in which an adversary can create an unlimited num-
ber of Sybil nodes and set up edges between them arbitrar-
ily. We denote the subnetwork comprising all honest nodes
to be the honest region, denote the subnetwork comprising
all Sybil nodes to be the Sybil region, and denote the edges
that connect the honest region and Sybil region to be the
attack edges. We denote g to be the number of attack edges.
2.2 Social Sybil Defenses
An important thread of research has investigated the use
of social trust relationships to mitigate the threat of Sybil
attacks [36, 35, 8, 7, 4, 16, 27], which rely on the insight that
it is costly for an adversary to set up trust relationships with
honest users (i.e., attack edges). These defenses use a wide
array of graph-theoretic techniques to bound the number or
inﬂuence of the Sybil identities in proportion to the number
of attack edges controlled by an adversary. For example,
the SybilLimit protocol [35] guarantees that an adversary
with g attack edges can insert about g · w Sybil identities,
where w is the mixing time of the honest social network.
Despite considerable diﬀerences between proposed mecha-
nisms, researchers have shown that they rely on identifying
local communities around a trust node [29].
Trust Assumptions: Social Sybil defenses often employ
two key assumptions. First, the honest region is fast mix-
ing, which presumes the existence of a well-connected, giant
community structure of honest users. Second, the social net-
work is a strong trust network, where the number of attack
edges is relatively small [29].
Prior work has shown that these assumptions oversim-
plify reality. Mohaisen et al. [20] measured the mixing time
of real-world social graphs and found that the actual mix-
ing time is longer than the theoretical value anticipated by
researchers who designed social Sybil defenses. This is due
to the presence of multiple small communities in real-world
social networks. Recent work has also questioned the as-
sumption that it is costly for an attacker to set up trust
relationships with honest users in the current online social
networks [31, 6, 12]. Yang et al. showed that the number
of attack edges may not be bounded if the underlying social

social networking platform in China, does not follow this as-
sumption [34]. Ghosh et al. [10] showed that link farming is
widespread on Twitter and that a majority of attack edges
are farmed from a small fraction of Twitter users. These
attacks highlight that relying on friendship links in current
online social networks is not suﬃcient.
We note that large number of attack edges and a longer
mixing time would degrade the security guarantees oﬀered
by these systems (e.g.
linearly with mixing time for Sybil-
Limit), but not render them inapplicable. Additionally, to
strengthen defenses against weak social links, prior work
has proposed (a) using user interactions to extract strong
real-world trust relationships that cannot be manipulated at
scale by an adversary [11, 31], or (b) explicitly asking users
to identify their most trusted social contacts [30].
3. OVERVIEW OF TEMPORAL ATTACKS
Temporal attacks against Sybil defenses exploit the dy-
namics of the underlying social network. Such attacks are
typically long-term attacks that incrementally exploit the
vulnerabilities of Sybil defenses as the system evolves.
In
this section, we present a taxonomy of temporal attacks,
and formalize our temporal attack model.
3.1 Temporal Attack Taxonomy
Based on the type of the exploited dynamic, we categorize
temporal attacks into three categories: (1) attacks based on
exploiting churn in the Sybil region, (2) attacks based on
exploiting churn in the attack edges, and (3) attacks based
on exploiting churn in the honest social region. The eﬀects
of these attacks can be compunded to eﬀectively compromise
system security.
3.1.1 Exploiting Churn in Sybil Region
The ﬁrst category of attacks aim to exploit churn in the
Sybil region. We observe that the attacker has complete
control over identities in the Sybil region, as well the edges
among the Sybil identities (which we term Sybil edges).
Thus, the attacker can (1) artiﬁcially induce churn in the
Sybil identities by deleting existing Sybil identities and in-
troducing new Sybil identities, and (2) artiﬁcially induce
churn among the edges connecting the Sybil identities by
creating new Sybil edges and deleting existing Sybil edges.
Note that such induced churn in the Sybil region does not
violate the assumptions made in Sybil-defense mechanisms,
since the number of attack edges remains bounded.
Next, we introduce a subclass of temporal attacks called
re-registration attacks that exploit churn in the Sybil region
while ensuring that the number of Sybil identities at any
given time remains the same. In a re-registration attack, a
strategic attacker can ﬁrst ensure that the total number of
Sybil identities are below the detection threshold for the cor-
