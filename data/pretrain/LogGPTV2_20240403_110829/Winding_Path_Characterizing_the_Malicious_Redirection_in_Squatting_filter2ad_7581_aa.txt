**Abstract:**
Adversaries increasingly use sophisticated redirection chains to mask their malicious sites. Previous studies have primarily focused on specific attacks users encounter, often neglecting how users are exposed to such threats. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study of malicious redirections that start with squatting domain names. We collected 101,186 resolved squatting domain names targeting 2,302 top brands from ISP-level DNS traffic. By dynamically crawling these domains, we pioneered the use of performance logs to uncover the involved redirection chains. Our analysis revealed that adversaries frequently employ URL redirection through imported JavaScript codes and iframes. Further investigation indicates that these intermediaries exhibit significant aggregation both in domain names and the supporting Internet infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction
URL redirection is a widely used technique that allows website administrators to provide more customized navigation services by specifying parameters in URLs. However, this technique is now being abused by adversaries to evade static web security checks. Instead of directly delivering malicious content, they use multi-layer verification during the redirection process to target specific visitors. For example, an adversary might check the 'User-Agent' field in the HTTP request header to determine if the visitor is a static crawler. While elaborate redirection chains enhance the stealth of malicious sites, they also reduce their accessibility. To attract more traffic, some adversaries exploit squatting domain names, which impersonate well-known brands to confuse visitors. By using these squatting domain names as the starting point of redirection chains, adversaries can control the direction of careless visitors and tailor malicious behavior based on visitor profiles.

To illustrate, Figure 1 shows a real-world example of a malicious redirection chain that uses a combo squatting domain name of 'nike.com'. To prevent further spread, some characters in the figure are hidden. This example involves 7 URLs and 6 hops, with the first hop using an HTTP-based redirection (status code 302) and the remaining five hops performed via JavaScript. Before reaching the fifth URL, no content is displayed. After rendering the HTML content from the fifth URL, a loading bar and a button appear (Page A). If the user does not interact within a given time, they are redirected to Page B, which lists illegal gambling links. Similarly, inactivity on Page B leads to a final URL serving an illegal pornographic site (Page C).

Previous studies have analyzed various types of squatting domain names but have not focused on how visitors are directed to the actual malicious sites. In this paper, we address this gap by:
1. Measuring typical squatting domain names in Chinese DNS traffic.
2. Pioneering the use of performance logs to mine malicious redirection chains.
3. Analyzing the redirection methods used by malicious intermediaries.
4. Profiling the sharing of intermediaries in malicious redirections.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Domain Squatting Abuse
Domain squatting abuse involves the malicious registration of domain names similar to well-known brands. There are six common types of domain squatting:
- **Typo**: Exploits typographical errors (e.g., 'bauidu.com' for 'baidu.com').
- **Bit**: Leverages bit flips (e.g., 'taocao.com' for 'taobao.com').
- **Homograph**: Uses visually indistinguishable characters (e.g., 'xvide0s.com' for 'xvideos.com').
- **Combo**: Combines the target brand with other words (e.g., 'nikeav.com' for 'nike.com').
- **Level**: Uses the target domain as a subdomain (e.g., 'weixin.qq.com.powlau.kunxiangrunhe.com.cn' for 'qq.com').
- **Wrong-TLD**: Replaces the top-level domain (e.g., 'cnki.xyz' for 'cnki.net').

### 2.2 URL Redirection
URL redirection techniques include:
- **HTTP-based**: Uses status codes (e.g., 30X) or the 'Refresh' header.
- **JavaScript-based**: Rewrites the 'location' attribute of the document or window object.
- **HTML-based**: Involves user clicks on `<a>` tags or automatic refresh using `<meta>` tags.

## 3. Measurement Methodology

### 3.1 Measuring Squatting Domains
We collected domain names of target brands from three authoritative sources:
- **Alexa Category List**: Top 50 visited domain names in 17 categories.
- **Alexa Top List**: Top 1000 most popular domain names.
- **CN Top List**: Top 1000 Chinese sites.

To account for daily fluctuations, we obtained Alexa Lists for 8 consecutive days and aggregated the data, merging domain names with the same second-level domain (2LD).
