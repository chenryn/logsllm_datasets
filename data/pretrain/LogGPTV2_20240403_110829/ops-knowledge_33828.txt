User: I used to be a java developer and we used tools like ant or maven to manage our development/testing/UAT environments in a standardized way. This allowed us to handle library dependencies, setting OS variables, compiling, deploying, running unit tests, and all the required tasks. Also, the scripts generated guaranteed that all the environments were almost equally configured, and all the task were performed in the same way by all the members of the team. 
I'm starting to work in Python now and I'd like your advice in which tools should I use to accomplish the same as described for java.
Assistant: I do exactly this with a combination of setuptools and Hudson. I know Hudson is a java app, but it can run Python stuff just fine.
