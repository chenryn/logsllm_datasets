Assistant: This log chunk is related to the display power controller and the alarm manager. The display power controller is animating the brightness to a target of 38 with a rate of 200. The alarm manager is sending an alarm and scheduling a time tick event. The keyguard update monitor is receiving a broadcast and handling the time update. The stack scroll algorithm is updating the clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive.
