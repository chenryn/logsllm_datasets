### Data Collection and Validation

We repeated the process for all 48 search phrases, collecting results daily from March 3, 2010, to April 11, 2010. This 48-query search led us to identify 371 source infections. We then simulated a search engine crawler to browse each of these infected sources, gathering several thousand additional search phrases linked from the infected websites. After removing duplicates, we compiled a corpus of 218 unique search queries.

To ensure that our selected queries had adequate coverage, we conducted a validation experiment. We obtained a six-month sample of spam emails (collected in late 2009) and ran SpamAssassin [5] to classify each email as either pharmacy-related or otherwise. We extracted all drug names from the pharmacy-related spam and found that they formed a subset of the drug names present in our search queries. This gave us confidence in the completeness of our query corpus.

Further validation was performed by comparing our query corpus to two additional corpora: 
1. An exhaustive list of 9,000 prescription drugs from the US Food & Drug Administration [15].
2. 1,179 drug-related search queries extracted from the HTTP logs of 169 source websites.

The results, detailed in Appendix A, confirmed that our 218 queries provided adequate coverage.

### Search-Result Classification

We classified all search results obtained by the search-engine agent into the following categories:
1. **Search-Redirection Attacks**: Websites that redirect to different sites upon arrival from a search engine.
2. **Health Resources**: Legitimate health information websites.
3. **Legitimate Online Pharmacies**: Registered pharmacies verified by Legitscript [3], which require a verified doctor's prescription and sell genuine drugs.
4. **Illicit Online Pharmacies**: Websites not on Legitscript’s whitelist and containing drug-related terms in their domain names.
5. **Blog or Forum Spam**: User-generated content abused for posting drug advertisements.
6. **Uncategorized**: Results that did not fit into any of the above categories.

**Search-Redirection Attacks** were identified by observing HTTP redirects to different websites. While legitimate websites use HTTP redirects, it is less common to redirect immediately to entirely different sites. The crawler followed and stored the intermediate URIs and IP addresses, which were used to infer relationships between source infections and pharmacies.

We performed robustness checks to validate the classification of external redirects as attacks:
1. 63% of source websites had known drug terms in at least one redirect URI.
2. 86% of redirecting websites pointed to the same website as 10 other redirecting websites.
3. 93% of redirecting websites exhibited at least one of these behaviors, indicating that most were likely infected.

**Health Resources** were identified using the Alexa Web Information Service API [1], based on the Open Directory [4]. 

**Legitimate and Illicit Online Pharmacies** were distinguished using Legitscript’s whitelist of 324 confirmed legitimate online pharmacies. Illicit pharmacies were those not on the whitelist and containing drug-related terms in their domain names.

**Blog and Forum Spam** were classified based on URI structure, checking for subdomains and paths indicating user-generated content, such as “blog,” “viewmember,” or “profile.”

### Empirical Analysis of Search Results

#### Breakdown of Search Results

Table 1 provides a breakdown of the search results collected over six months. Out of 137,354 distinct URIs, 44,503 (32%) were compromised websites actively redirecting to pharmacies. These corresponded to 4,652 unique infected source domains. An additional 29,406 URIs shared domains with active redirecting URIs but did not exhibit redirection, possibly due to remediation or failed search engine optimization.

Very few search results led to legitimate resources: 1,817 URIs (1.3%) pointed to health resource websites, and only nine (0.04%) led to legitimate pharmacy websites. In contrast, 2,129 illicit pharmacies appeared directly in the search results, and 30% of the results directed users to legitimate websites where miscreants had posted spam advertisements.

#### Variation in Search Position

Appearing at the top of search results is crucial for the success of search-redirection attacks. We collected data for an additional 10 weeks from November 15, 2010, to February 1, 2011, recording the position of each URI in the search results.

Figure 2(a) shows that search-redirection attacks appeared in the first position about one-third of the time, with 17% actively redirecting. Blog and forum spam appeared in the top spot 30% of the time, while illicit pharmacies accounted for 22% and legitimate health resources just 5%.

The distribution of results across all 64 positions was fairly consistent. Active search-redirection attacks increased slightly in lower rankings, rising to 26% in positions 6-10. The share of illicit pharmacies fell considerably after the first position, from 22% to 14% for positions 2-10.

#### Turnover in Search Results

Web search results can be dynamic. Figure 2(b) shows the average daily count of unique domains for two-week periods from May 2010 to February 2011. The number of illicit pharmacies and health resources remained fairly constant, while blogs and forums with pharmaceutical postings decreased by almost half. Notably, the number of source infections increased from 580 per day in early May to 895 by late January, a 50% increase.

#### Variation in Search Queries

Using Google’s Traffic Estimator, we fetched the estimated number of global monthly searches for our 218 pharmacy search terms, totaling over 2.4 million searches. Some terms were searched frequently (up to 246,000 times per month), while others were rare.

Figure 2(c) plots the average number of unique URIs observed per query for each category. For unpopular searches (less than 100 global monthly searches), search-redirection attacks and blog spam appeared with similar frequency. As query popularity increased, search-redirection attacks continued to appear consistently, while blog and forum spam dropped significantly (from 355 URIs per query to 105). Health resources became increasingly crowded out by illicit websites as queries became more popular.
