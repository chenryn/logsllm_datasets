We then repeated this process for all 48 search phrases,
gathering results daily from March 3, 2010 through April
11, 2010. The 48-query search subsequently led us to
371 source infections. We again browsed each of these
source infections posing as a search engine crawler, and
gathered a few thousand search phrases linked from the
infected websites. After again sorting through the dupli-
cates, we got a corpus of 218 unique search queries.
The risk of starting from a single seed is to only iden-
tify a single unrepresentative campaign. Hence, we ran a
validation experiment to ensure that our selected queries
had satisfactory coverage. We obtained a six-month sam-
ple of spam email (collected at a different time period,
late 2009) gathered in a different context [42]. We ran
SpamAssassin [5] on this spam corpus, to classify each
spam as either pharmacy-related or otherwise. We then
extracted all drug names encountered in the pharmacy-
related spam, and observed that they deﬁned a subset of
the drug names present in our search queries. This gave
us conﬁdence that the query corpus was quite complete.
We further validated our query selection by comparing
results obtained with our query corpus to those collected
from two additional query corpora: 1) searches ran on
an exhaustive list of 9 000 prescription drugs obtained
from the US Food & Drug Administration [15], and
2) 1 179 drug-related search queries extracted from the
HTTP logs of 169 source websites. The results (in Ap-
pendix A) conﬁrm adequate coverage of our 218 queries.
2.3 Search-result classiﬁcation
We attempt to classify all results obtained by the search-
engine agent. Each query returns a mix of legitimate re-
3
sults (e.g., health information websites) and abusive re-
sults (e.g., spammed blog comments and forum postings
advertising online pharmacies). We seek to distinguish
between these different types of activity to better under-
stand the impact of search-redirection attacks may have
on legitimate pharmacies and other forms of abuse. We
assign each result into one of the following categories:
1) search-redirection attacks, 2) health resources, 3) le-
gitimate online pharmacies, 4) illicit online pharmacies,
5) blog or forum spam, and 6) uncategorized.
We mark websites as participating in search-
redirection attacks by observing an HTTP redirect to
a different website. Legitimate websites regularly use
HTTP redirects, but it is less common to redirect to en-
tirely different websites immediately upon arrival from
a search engine. Every time the crawler encounters a
redirect, it recursively follows and stores the intermedi-
ate URIs and IP addresses encountered in the database.
These redirection chains are used to infer relationships
between source infections and pharmacies in Section 4.3.
We performed two robustness checks to assess the
suitability of classifying all external redirects as attacks.
First, we found known drug terms in at least one redirect
URI for 63% of source websites. Second, we found that
86% of redirecting websites point to the same website
as 10 other redirecting websites. Finally, 93% of redi-
recting websites exhibit at least one of these behaviors,
suggesting that the vast majority of redirecting websites
are infected. In fact, we expect that most of the remain-
ing 7% are also infected, but some attackers use unique
websites for redirection. Thus, treating all external redi-
rects as malicious appears reasonable in this study.
Health resources are websites such as webmd.com
that describe characteristics of a drug. We used the Alexa
Web Information Service API [1], which is based on the
Open Directory [4] to determine each website category.
We distinguish between legitimate and illicit online
pharmacies by using a list of registered pharmacies ob-
tained from the non-proﬁt organization Legitscript [3].
Legitscript maintains a whitelist of 324 conﬁrmed legit-
imate online pharmacies, which require a veriﬁed doc-
tor’s prescription and sell genuine drugs.
Illicit phar-
macies are websites which do not appear in Legitscript’s
whitelist, and whose domain name contains drug names
or words such as “pill,” “tabs,” or “prescription.” Legit-
Script’s list is likely incomplete, so we may incorrectly
categorize some collected legitimate pharmacies as il-
licit, because they have not been certiﬁed by LegitScript.
Finally, blog and forum spam captures the frequent oc-
currence where websites that allow user-generated con-
tent are abused by users posting drug advertisements. We
classify these websites based only on the URI structure,
since collecting and storing the pages referenced by URIs
is cost-prohibitive. We ﬁrst check the URI subdomain

and path for common terms indicating user-contributed
content, such as “blog,” “viewmember” or “proﬁle.” We
also check any remaining URIs for drug terms appearing
in the subdomain and path. While these might in fact be
compromised websites that have been loaded with con-
tent, upon manual inspection the activity appears consis-
tent with user-generated content abuse.
3 Empirical analysis of search results
We begin our measurement analysis by examining the
search results collected by the crawler. The objective
here is to understand how prevalent search-redirection
attacks are, in both absolute terms and relative to legit-
imate sources and other forms of abuse.
3.1 Breakdown of search results
Table 1 presents a breakdown of all search results ob-
tained during the six months of primary data collection.
137 354 distinct URIs correspond to 23 042 different do-
mains. We observed 44 503 of these URIs to be com-
promised websites (source infections) actively redirect-
ing to pharmacies, 32% of the total. These corresponded
to 4 652 unique infected source domains. We examine
the redirection chains in more detail in Section 4.3.
An additional 29 406 URIs did not exhibit redirection
even though they shared domains with URIs where we
did observe redirection. There are several plausible ex-
planations for why only some URIs on a domain will
redirect to pharmacies. First, websites may continue to
appear in the search results even after they have been re-
mediated and stop redirecting to pharmacies. In Figure 1,
the third link to appear in the search engine results has
been disinfected, but the search engine is not yet aware
of that. For 17% of the domains with inactive redirection
links, the inactive links only appear in the search results
after all the active redirects have stopped appearing.
However, for the remaining 83% of domains, the in-
active links are interspersed among the URIs which ac-

tively redirect. In this case, we expect that the miscre-
ants’ search engine optimization has failed, incorrectly
promoting pages on the infected website that do not redi-
rect to pharmacies.
By comparison, very few search results led to legiti-
mate resources. 1 817 URIs, 1.3% of the total, pointed
to websites offering health resources. Even more strik-
ing, only nine legitimate pharmacy websites, or 0.04%
of the total, appeared in the search results. By contrast,
2 129 illicit pharmacies appeared directly in the search
results. 30% of the results pointed to legitimate web-
sites where miscreants had posted spam advertisements
to online pharmacies.
In contrast to the infected web-
sites, these results require a user to click on the link to
arrive at the pharmacy. It is also likely that many of these
results were not intended for end users to visit; instead,
they could be used to promote infected websites higher
in the search results.
3.2 Variation in search position
Merely appearing in search results is not enough
to ensure success for miscreants perpetrating search-
redirection attacks. Appearing towards the top of the
search results is also essential [20]. To that end, we col-
lected data for an additional 10 weeks from November
15th 2010 to February 1st 2011 where we recorded the
position of each URI in the search results.
Figure 2(a) presents the ﬁndings. Around one third of
the time, search-redirection attacks appeared in the ﬁrst
position of the search results. 17% of the results were
actively redirecting at the time they were observed in the
ﬁrst position. Blog and forum spam appeared in the top
spot in 30% of results, while illicit pharmacies accounted
for 22% and legitimate health resources just 5%.
The distribution of results remains fairly consistent
across all 64 positions. Active search-redirection attacks
increase their proportion slightly as the rankings fall, ris-
ing to 26% in positions 6–10. The share of illicit pharma-
cies falls considerably after the ﬁrst position, from 22%
to 14% for positions 2–10. Overall, it is striking how
consistently all types of manipulation have crowded out
legitimate health resources across all search positions.
3.3 Turnover in search results
Web search results can be very dynamic, even with-
out an adversary trying to manipulate the outcome. We
count the number of unique domains we observe in
each day’s sample for the categories outlined in Sec-
tion 2. Figure 2(b) shows the average daily count for two-
week periods from May 2010 to February 2011, cov-
ering both sample periods. The number of illicit phar-
macies and health resources remains fairly constant over
time, whereas the number of blogs and forums with phar-
maceutical postings fell by almost half between May
and February. Notably, the number of source infections
steadily increased from 580 per day in early May to 895
by late January, a 50% increase in daily activity.
3.4 Variation in search queries
As part of its AdWords program, Google offers a free
service called Trafﬁc Estimator to check the estimated
number of global monthly searches for any phrase.3 We
fetched the results for the 218 pharmacy search terms
we regularly check; in total, over 2.4 million searches
each month are made using these terms. This gives us
a good ﬁrst approximation of the relative popularity of
web searches for ﬁnding drugs through online pharma-
cies. Some terms are searched for very frequently (as
much as 246 000 times per month), while other terms are
only searched for very occasionally.
We now explore whether the quality of search results
vary according to the query’s popularity. We might ex-
pect that less-popular search terms are easier to manip-

manipulate the results of popular queries.
Figure 2(c) plots the average number of unique URIs
observed per query for each category. For unpopular
searches, with less than 100 global monthly searches,
search-redirection attacks and blog spam appear with
similar frequency. However, as the popularity of the
search term increases, search-redirection attacks con-
tinue to appear in the search results with roughly the
same regularity, while the blog and forum spam drops
considerably (from 355 URIs per query to 105).
While occurring on a smaller scale, the trends of illicit
pharmacies and legitimate health resources are also note-
worthy. Health resources become increasingly crowded
out by illicit websites as queries become more popular.
