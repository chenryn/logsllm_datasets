their unit
structures have the following categories. Web applications (e.g.
ﬁrefox and chromium) have tabs as their execution units. For
example, Chromium’s built-in log uses a same connection id

* Not-long running applications.
to denote all sub-tasks originated from the same tab, which is
very similar to the transaction id in ﬁrefox, allowing tracking
causality in its complex asynchronous execution model. Editor
applications (e.g. ofﬁce, text editor, and graphic editor) have
individual windows and ﬁles as units. Shell programs (e.g.
bash and zsh) have a history ﬁle that records all the interactive
commands and individual commands can hence be considered
as different units. For server programs, each connection is
considered as a unit. Class I execution model (sequential single
process) is widely used by editors and ﬁrewall applications.
Class II (process forking) is used in simple UI programs
(e.g. gscan2pdf) and ftp servers. Asynchronous models III, IV,
and V are commonly used by complex UI programs such as
Thunderbird and Geary.
