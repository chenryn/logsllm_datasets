Identifying Seed Products and Terms
5.2
Because Amazon computes the view and search-based
recommendation lists separately, the seed data required
exploit each list must also be different.
Visit-Based Pollution. To promote a targeted product
in a view-based recommendation list, an attacker must
identify a seed product as follows. Given a targeted prod-
uct that an attacker wishes to promote, the attacker visits
the Amazon page of the product and retrieves the related
products that are shown on Amazon page of the targeted
product. To test the suitability of these related products,
the attacker can visit the Amazon page of that product
and subsequently check the Amazon home page. If the
targeted product appears in a recommendation list, the
URL of the candidate related product can serve as a seed
to promote the targeted product.
Search-Based Pollution. To promote a targeted prod-
uct in a search-based recommendation list, it sufﬁces to
identify an appropriate search term. If automation is de-
sired, an attacker could use a natural language toolkit to
automatically extract a candidate keyword set from the
targeted product’s name. Any combination of these key-
words that successfully isolates the targeted product can
be used as the seed search term for promoting the tar-
geted product. For example, to promote product “Bre-
ville BJE200XL Compact Juice Fountain 700-Watt Juice
Injecting Views and Searches
5.3
As with the attacks on the previous two services, the at-
tacker embeds the Amazon URLs of the desired seed
items or search queries into a website that the victim’s
browser is induced to visit with XSRF. For example, if
one seed search terms is “Coffee Maker”, the seed URL
would be something like http://www.amazon.com/s/
?field-keywords=Coffee+Maker. Similarly, an at-
tacker could embed the URL of a seed product into an
invisible img tag as the src of the image. When a victim
visits the attacker’s website, Amazon receives the request
for that particular query or item and customizes the vic-
tim’s Amazon website based on that search.
5.4 Experiment Design
To evaluate the effectiveness of the pollution attack
against, we conducted two experiments. The ﬁrst exper-
iment measured the effectiveness of our attack when tar-
geted toward popular items across different categories of
Amazon products. The second quantiﬁed the effective-
ness of our attack on randomly selected, mostly unpopu-
lar Amazon products.
5.4.1 Popular Products
Amazon categorizes sellers’ products into 32 root cat-
egories. To select products from each category, we

scraped the top 100 best-selling products in each cate-
gory in January 2013 and launched a separate attack tar-
geting each of these 3,200 items.
5.4.2 Random Products
To evaluate the effectiveness of the polution attack for
promoting arbitrary products, we also selected prod-
ucts randomly. We downloaded a list of Amazon Stan-
dard Identiﬁcation Number (ASIN) [1] that includes
75,115,473 ASIN records. Because each ASIN repre-
sents a Amazon product, we randomly sampled ASINs
from the list and constructed a set of 3,000 products cur-
rently available for sale. For every randomly selected
product in the list, we recorded the sale ranking of that
product in its corresponding category.
5.5 Evaluation
Because Amazon computes search and visit-based rec-
ommendations based entirely upon the most recent his-
tory, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the pollution
attack without using Amazon accounts from real users.
Thus, we measured the effectiveness of our attack by
studying the success rate of promoting our targeted prod-
ucts for fresh Amazon accounts.
5.5.1 Promoting Products in Different Categories
To evaluate the effectiveness of the pollution attack for
each targeted product, we checked whether the ASIN of
the targeted product matches the ASIN of an item in the
recommendation lists on the user’s customized Amazon
homepage.
Figure 9 illustrates the promotion rate of target prod-
ucts in each category. The view-based and search-based
attacks produced similar promotion rates across all cate-
gories, about 78% on average. Two categories had sig-
niﬁcantly lower propotion rates: Gift-Cards-Store and
Movies-TV (achieving 5% and 25%, respectively).
To understand why these categories yielded lower pro-
motion rates, we analyzed the top 100 best selling prod-
ucts for each category. For Gift-Cards-Store, we found
that there were two factors that distinguish gift cards
from other product types. First, the gift cards all had
similar names;
therefore, using the keywords derived
from the product name resulted in only a small number
of speciﬁc gift cards being recommended. Second, we
found that searching any combination of keywords ex-
tracted from the product names always caused a promo-
tion of Amazon’s own gift cards, which may imply that
it is more difﬁcult to promote product types that Amazon
competes with directly.
Further investigation into the Movies-TV category re-
vealed that Amazon recommends TV episodes differ-
ently. In our attempts to promote speciﬁc TV episodes,
we found that Amazon recommends instead the ﬁrst or
latest episode of the corresponding TV series or the en-
tire series. Because we declared a promotion success-
ful only if the exact ASIN appears in the recommenda-
tion lists, these alternate recommendations are consid-
ered failures. These cases can also be considered suc-
cessful because the attack caused the promotion of very
similar products. Therefore, we believe that for all cat-
egories except for Gift-Cards-Store, an attacker has a
signiﬁcant chance of successfully promoting best-selling
products.
5.5.2 Promoting Randomly Selected Products
We launched pollution attacks on 3,000 randomly se-
lected products. We calculated the Cumulative Success
Rate of products with respect to their rankings. The Cu-

a complex network infrastructure, which may consist
of hundreds of search-indexed websites (preferably with
non-trivial reputations at established search engines) to
coordinate and form a link farm [20]. These infrastruc-
tures not only require a considerable amount of money
to build and maintain, but also take time to mature and
reach their full effectiveness [8]. By contrast, launching
a search history pollution attack is signiﬁcantly easier.
We showed in Section 4 that a user’s personalized
search results can be manipulated simply by issuing
crafted search queries to Google. Without requiring any
external support, the entire process happens instantly
while the user is visiting the offending Web page. Al-
though our attack targets individual search users (i.e., the
polluted result is only visible to individual victims), it by
no means limits the scale of the victim population, espe-
cially if an exploit is placed on a high-proﬁle, frequently
visited website.
7 Discussion
Our current study has several limitations. Most notably,
the scale of our experiments is modest, but because we
typically randomly select the target items, we believe that
the results of our experiments are representative, and that
