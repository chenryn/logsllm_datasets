**Summary**  
When installing scikit-learn on aarch64 using the command `pip3 install scikit-learn`, pip attempts to build the wheel from the source code, as no pre-built wheel is available for this architecture on the PyPI repository.

**Problem Description**  
Currently, the PyPI repository does not provide a pre-built wheel for scikit-learn on aarch64. As a result, when users attempt to install scikit-learn via pip on an aarch64 system, pip must build the wheel from the source code. This process significantly increases the installation time. Providing a pre-built wheel for aarch64 would greatly benefit users by reducing the installation time.

**Expected Output**  
Pip should be able to download a pre-built scikit-learn wheel from the PyPI repository instead of building it from the source code.

@scikit-learn-team, I am eager to assist in the creation and uploading of the scikit-learn wheel for aarch64 to the PyPI repository. Making the wheel available for aarch64 would be a valuable contribution, and I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with you on this effort.
