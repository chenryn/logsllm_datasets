 **Summary**  
Installing scikit-learn on aarch64 via pip using command "pip3 install scikit-
learn" tries to build wheel from source code
**Problem description**  
scikit-learn don't have wheel for aarch64 on PyPI repository. So, while
installing scikit-learn via pip on aarch64, pip builds wheel for same
resulting in it takes more time to install scikit-learn. Making wheel
available for aarch64 will benefit aarch64 users by minimizing scikit-learn
installation time.
**Expected Output**  
Pip should be able to download scikit-learn wheel from PyPI repository rather
than building it from source code.
@scikit-learn-team, please let me know if I can help you building
wheel/uploading to PyPI repository. I am curious to make scikit-learn wheel
available for aarch64. It will be a great opportunity for me to work with you.
