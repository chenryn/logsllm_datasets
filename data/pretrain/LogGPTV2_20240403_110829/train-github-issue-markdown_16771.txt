I believe this bug has various scenarios for happening, but I've managed to
pinpoint just one:
When opening the editor, (only) after adding some object, and duplicating the
tab, some settings get corrupt. At the least the keyboard shortcuts are
corrupted, but I have reason to believe it may be more than that.
