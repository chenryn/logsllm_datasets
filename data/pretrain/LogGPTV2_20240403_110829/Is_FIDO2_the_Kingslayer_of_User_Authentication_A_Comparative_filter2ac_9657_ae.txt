the yubikey [Yubico Security Key]. Otherwise you
would be very dependent on it.” (P50, Group1FA)
Interestingly, one of our participants, who claims to have
“already been on the receiving end of the password theft,”
points out that the biggest advantage of passwordless authen-
tication is the implicit guarantee that no one else can access
users’ accounts as long as they are in possession of their own
security key. In this way, the disappearance of the security key
from one’s own possession immediately warns the user of a
potential (impending) unauthorized access to their account—
something that passwords simply cannot offer.
If we compare the two types of authentication, we can
see that the threat model for passwordless authentication is
fundamentally different from the one for passwords. Because
a physical object is required for authentication, the concerns
of our participants about threats from the online world, such as
phishing or password leaks, are radically reduced. On the other
hand, such a dependency brought attention to the inherent
natural weakness of such physical objects, their susceptibility
to loss, theft, and destruction. Especially the fear of losing
access to one’s own accounts seems to be of great concern.
c) Restrictions in applicability: Another major problem
that has arisen in relation to passwordless authentication are
situational barriers associated with this type of authentication.
Participants (14; 30% Group1FA) complained about technical
incompatibilities, which can be traced back to the speciﬁc
implementation of the security key, especially the applicability
for mobile devices,
like smartphones or tablets. For our
participants, an implementation using USB, as we studied it,
seems problematic and perhaps even outdated.
“Nowadays an USB dongle seem to be a bit old,
new computer doesn’t have this port, also probably
most of the authentication on these days are done in
mobile devices. . . ” (P70, Group1FA)
On the other hand, participants (7; 14%) from GroupPass
came up with cases of authentication in which passwords seem
to be superior to other technologies because of their ﬂexibility.
In this context, they mentioned the ability to spontaneously
delegate accounts via telephone or the usage of specially
protected computers (e.g., public computer in a library) that
do not provide access to standard interfaces.
". . . If necessary, you can also help relatives via
telephone or Internet by changing something in their
account or doing something for them if they are
prevented from doing so."(P9, GroupPass)
"Public PCs may not provide an accessible USB
interface." (P84, Group1FA)
In summary, these ﬁndings indicate that passwordless au-
thentication cannot yet cover all user scenarios (at least with
the tested USB implementation) and that neglecting speciﬁc
corner-cases could be very problematic.
d) Breaking with traditions and habitual patterns: In
contrast to the previous points, many statements of the partici-
pants also described aspects connected to the mental migration
process from passwords to passwordless authentication. As
such, this shift means a break with the well-established habits
and traditions of users. Over the course of our study, it became
very clear that our participants (40; 82% GroupPass) have a
clear mental model of password-based authentication. They
know the pros and cons and have a certain understanding of
the factors responsible for the security of a password (35; 71%
GroupPass). At least for our participants this positive mental
model does not seem to have been challenged by prior negative
experiences (e.g., by account theft) and therefore became the
mental default for authentication.
"[I use passwords] for all accounts, because I have
never had any problems with it, which means my
accounts have never been hacked." (P33, GroupPass)
For passwordless authentication, on the other hand, such
mental models must ﬁrst be established in the users’ minds.

Although the videos in our study already seem to be a helpful
introduction to this new technology from the participants’
point of view (5; 11% Group1FA), obvious misconceptions in
the free-text responses (27; 59% Group1FA) show that their
mental models are only rudimentary.
"Is it possible to track my exact location once I insert
the Yubikey [Yubico Security Key]?" (P52, Group1FA)
Such lack of technical background knowledge and the
associated lack of trust can be one of the biggest obstacles
to the adoption of any kind of new authentication method.
One of our participants summarizes this quite clearly:
"Most people might rather use a password because
they better understand and know how it works."
(P72, Group1FA)
However, these hindering factors for adoption were coun-
tered in our study by an affective reaction to passwordless
authentication that was very positive. Thereby, the majority of
participants (27; 59%) in Group1FA described the authentica-
tion as a fun, pleasant, and exciting new user experience.
“It was overall very nice and pleasant. I found it
very intuitive to use.” (P62, Group1FA)
This is countered by a rather negative affective reaction
to password-based authentication (3; 6% GroupPass), which is
described as "monotonous," "boring," and in total "annoying."
In summary, it can be said that due to the lack of mental
models and knowledge about the security of passwordless
authentication, it might be still a bumpy road to embed this
authentication method as a real alternative to passwords in
users’ minds. Nevertheless, the very positive affective reaction
of our participants to passwordless authentication gives us
hope that users are ready to replace passwords.
e) Security key characteristics: After all these mainly
conceptual aspects of FIDO2 passwordless authentication, we
would like to mention two further points regarding the speciﬁc
authenticator we used. A few of the participants (7; 15%
Group1FA) mentioned experiences that may raise doubts about
the robustness and maturity of the device. For instance, the
form factor of the Yubico Security Key led to ambiguous and
misleading situations for our participants.
"[I] inserted the Yubikey [Yubico Security Key] into
the wrong slot, and later when the message still
kept showing, realized that hadn’t inserted into the
correct slot " (P92, Group1FA)
“Once the Yubikey [Yubico Security Key] didn’t react
and I didn’t know if I had to press it or it’s enough
to just hold my ﬁnger on it.” (P60, Group1FA)
In addition, several participants (10; 22% Group1FA) consid-
ered the price of the Yubico Security Key to be very expensive.
“. . . I don’t want to spend money on the key [Yubico
Security Key]...” (P57, Group1FA)
While these ﬁndings apply in particular to the security key,
we will further address implications and recommendations for
the design of authenticator devices in the following discussion.

D. Willingness to (not) use passwordless authentication
In the end we asked our participants if they now would be
willing to use passwordless authentication in their private lives.
We identiﬁed four different categories in our participants’
responses, which we coded as "Yes", "Yes, but", "Rather not"
and "No." Table IV summarizes our participants’ answers. We
also coded their arguments about why they would (not) use it
and we list the most mentioned arguments in the table.
Of all 46 participants in Group1FA, 16 (35%) mentioned that
they would be willing to use the scheme without any further
conditions and explicitly highlighted the ease and convenience
of the method over passwords. Most of them also mentioned
they would use the method on almost all kinds of websites.
This indicates that they found the scheme secure enough to
apply even on their most important websites.
The remaining participants (30; 65% Group1FA) had differ-
ent kinds of concerns. Participants in the “Yes, but” subgroup
gave concrete conditions that have to be met for them to
be fully willing to use passwordless authentication, while
participants in the ”Rather not” and “No” subgroups gave
explicit reasons why they are not willing to use passwordless
authentication. All three concerned groups mentioned the al-
most exact same set of arguments, only with slightly different
rankings. In general, the "Fear of losing access to the own
account" or "Fear of access to their account by others" and
"Mistrust" were mentioned most frequently (16; 53% and 10;
33% respectively), followed by "Lack of universal access" and
"Costly." Only participants in the "No" subgroup argued more
frequently with the "Annoyance to carry an extra device."
Overall, the results in Table IV suggest that there is a high
potential willingness to use passwordless authentication over
text-based passwords, if certain obstacles were addressed. On
the other hand, there are also reasons that seem to discourage
users from switching to passwordless authentication. In the
following Section VII, we make suggestions how most of these
problems could be addressed in a way so that passwordless
authentication may appeal to the majority of the users.

E. Stability of Findings
In practice, the process of introducing users to new authen-
tication methods is usually not as detailed as in our study. On
the one hand, most websites only offer minimal information
in the form of an abstract text and rarely a step-by-step guide.
On the other hand, not all users are willing to spend several
minutes watching an introduction video. To ensure the validity
of our ﬁndings also for such conditions, after our main study
we tested another group of participants (1FA control group, or
short: Group1FAcon) to whom we explicitly provided no detailed
introduction about FIDO2 and the security key.
Group1FAcon (n = 47) went through the same test procedure
as Group1FA from our main study except for the following
two changes: 1) we omitted the introduction video and any
communication of beneﬁts or risks (Stages 2–5 in main study);
and 2) we added minimal guidance on how to use the security
key in a modal dialog on the websites’ registration pages. This
dialog was optional for registration/login and only appeared if
participants explicitly "clicked for more info" on the registra-
tion page (see Figure 3 in Appendix E). The design of this
dialog was copied from the 2FA instructions for activating a
security key on the actual Facebook and Google sites (see
Figures 4 and 5 in Appendix E for a comparison).
a) Quantitative results: Appendix E provides all anal-
yses presented for the main study supplemented by the data
of Group1FAcon. In general, Group1FAcon did not substantially
differ from the other groups in terms of demographic compo-
sition. In line with the results from the main study, we found
signiﬁcant higher SUS and acceptance scores in Group1FA and
Group1FAcon than in GroupPass (M = 71.77) , but no differences
between the two FIDO2 groups (Group1FA and Group1FAcon).
A regression analysis, following the approach from our main
study, showed very similar results. In total 42.6% of the
empirical variance in acceptance could be explained by the
predictors in the model. Signiﬁcant effects on the acceptance
were found only for SUS (b = .03, p < .001) and the predictors
that represent the differences between GroupPass (b = .70,
p < .001) and Group1FAcon (b = .66, p < .001). A more
detailed analysis showed no signiﬁcant difference between
the two FIDO2 groups (b = .04, p = .720). In contrast
to the main study, a post-hoc relative importance assigned
SUS a slightly higher relative importance (56.2%) than the
predictors that represent the differences between the groups
(41.9%). Thereby, the calculation of the relative importance of
predictors is also subject to effects of sampling measurement
error, which may explain deviations in this range [70]. In
summary, the quantitative results of Group1FAcon suggested
that even without a detailed introduction, FIDO2 passwordless
authentication was perceived as more usable and was more
accepted than traditional password-based authentication.
b) Qualitative results: Two independent researchers eval-
uated the free text answers of Group1FAcon and neither found a
topic that was not yet included in the code-book from the main
study. Consequently, this coding scheme was used to allow
comparison to the results of the main study. In general, there
were only very limited differences in the response patterns
between Group1FAcon and Group1FA. For instance,
in both
groups a similar proportion of participants mentioned the re-
duction of cognitive effort as a great advantage of passwordless
technology (Group1FAcon 94%, Group1FA 96%), but also spe-
ciﬁc restrictions in applicability of passwordless authentication
were mentioned by participants from both groups (Group1FAcon
13%, Group1FA 30%). However, speciﬁc differences between
both groups were found for B.2 Threat model and D.2 Sys-
tem transparency. In contrast to Group1FA (17%), a higher
proportion of people in Group1FAcon (49%) were worried as
they considered their accounts to be unprotected as soon as
their security key fell into the wrong hands (P47: "I am very
afraid that the key will be lost and someone else will get
access to all my passwords“). Also, a larger proportion of the
participants in Group1FAcon (49% vs 20% in Group1FA) showed
distrust regarding the security key (P28: "Privacy, how do they
collect our data and how much data do "they" have (Who are
"they"?)”). Additionally, participants in the Group1FAcon more
often (47%) explicitly stated that they lack the knowledge to
understand and trust passwordless authentication than in the
Group1FA (17%)(P43 :“[. . . ] I would need more information
about how it works, to really judge the key”). In summary, the
qualitative results of Group1FAcon suggested that even without
the detailed introduction of passwordless authentication, the
same thoughts and opinions were triggered as in the main
study. However, the results also showed that, as expected from
previous research, a lack of clarity about the functionality and
security beneﬁts of authentication methods can lead to more
open questions and concerns among users.
c) Willingness to (not) use passwordless authentication:
We applied the same code book (see Table IV in Section VI)
for the Group1FAcon responses about why or why not they
would be willing to use 1FA authentication. Our results show
that the “Yes, but” subgroup is the largest in Group1FAcon.
to Group1FA (13; 28%), 25 (53%) out of 47
In contrast
participants in Group1FAcon mentioned that
they would be
willing to use 1FA under some conditions. This is twice
as many as in Group1FA. Most of the participants in both
Group1FA and Group1FAcon mentioned the almost exact same
arguments, only with different ranking: in Group1FAcon, almost
of a quarter (10; 21%) of the participants named “Mistrust,”
while only 3 (6%) mentioned this in Group1FA. A detailed
comparison of the willingness among the two 1FA groups is
presented in Table XI in Appendix E.
VII. DISCUSSION
We discuss the results of our study and make recommenda-
tions to try to address users’ concerns.
A. Closer to a Password Killer?
In our expert assessment, FIDO2 with a security key ticks
off almost all beneﬁts and our quantitative results also clearly
show that end-users consider this solution both usable and
convenient, and do accept it more than text-based passwords.
So, is FIDO2 the kingslayer for web authentication? While its

high acceptance is encouraging for the future, our qualitative
results show a gap between the users’ demands and concerns
and the current status of FIDO2 authentication with hardware
tokens. In the following, we discuss the aspects that we ﬁnd
most interesting in more detail and try to outline recommen-
dations on how the users’ concerns could be addressed.
1) Recovery at scale: A predominant concern among the
participants in Group1FA was the loss of the security key,
which they feared would bar them from accessing their ac-
counts. This is in line with prior user study results on 2FA
with security keys. Up until today, this issue has not been
properly addressed, e.g., the FIDO Alliance recommends as
account recovery practice for relying parties [71] to "strongly
encourage account holders to add additional authenticators
when the account is created or when the account with no
additional authenticator is identiﬁed", such that users retain
account access in case an authenticator is lost or broken.
A review of how top websites advise their users to set up
fallback and backup authentication mechanisms (see Table V)
showed mixed and inconsistent guidance. Most websites only
require setup of one second factor but do not enforce a backup
factor, with the notable exceptions of Dropbox and Google’s
Advanced Protection Program.
A new, very likely future challenge for account recovery
with FIDO2 1FA (and even with 2FA), in contrast to prior
scenarios, will be the scale of the recovery effort. The un-
linkable reuse of a single authenticator is considered a strong
point of FIDO2 authentication, since the user only needs
one device for all accounts. However, if the device is lost,
the user has to potentially recover access to all accounts
for which this authenticator was registered. Unless the user
employed the same backup device for all accounts, allowing
for an easy switch of the authenticator, the task of account
recovery can become burdensome and frustrating, considering
that users have an increasing number of accounts [45]. This
can potentially impede future adoption of FIDO2 1FA.
Recommendation: Reusing an authenticator across web-
sites ampliﬁes the risk of losing access to multiple accounts
at once. Users have to be supported and guided in strategies
for scalable account recovery.
2) Authenticator revocation: A new concern in this setting
that a few participants raised is device theft and account access
by the thief. Security discussions around FIDO2 and also
prior work on 2FA [26] noted that this risk is lower than
the risk of being victim of a phishing campaign or server
breach, and further, that the thief needs physical access. This
is the objective view of a global risk assessment, which is
in stark contrast to the users’ subjective view we found. We
think that those concerns are discarded too prematurely in a
discussion of passwordless authentication. Recent results [72]
have shown the length to which abusers in intimate partner
violence are willing to go or users might have added personally
identiﬁable information to their key [73] that allows linking the
key with accounts. It is unclear to which extent passwordless
authentication will ease or hamper such targeted attacks (e.g.,
a physical token might not be as concealable as a memorized
