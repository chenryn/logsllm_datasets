Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business relationships to use during targeting. This information can encompass a wide range of details, such as second- or third-party organizations and their associated domains (e.g., managed service providers, contractors) that have network access, potentially with elevated privileges. Additionally, this data may uncover supply chains and shipment paths for the victimâ€™s hardware and software resources. Understanding these relationships allows adversaries to identify potential entry points and plan more effective attacks.
