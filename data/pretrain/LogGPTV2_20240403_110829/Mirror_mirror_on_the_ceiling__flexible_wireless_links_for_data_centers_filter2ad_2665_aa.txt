## Abstract
Modern data centers are massive and support a wide range of distributed applications across potentially hundreds of server racks. As their utilization and bandwidth requirements continue to grow, traditional methods of augmenting bandwidth have become complex and costly in terms of both time and resources. Recent measurements show that data center traffic is often limited by congestion caused by short traffic bursts. An attractive alternative to adding physical bandwidth is to augment wired links with wireless links in the 60 GHz band.

This paper addresses two key limitations of current 60 GHz wireless proposals. First, 60 GHz wireless links are constrained by line-of-sight (LOS) and can be blocked by even small obstacles. Second, beamforming links, while directional, still leak power, leading to potential interference that severely limits concurrent transmissions in dense data centers. We propose and evaluate a new wireless primitive for data centers, 3D beamforming, where 60 GHz signals bounce off the data center ceiling, establishing indirect LOS between any two racks. 

We built a small 3D beamforming testbed to demonstrate its ability to address both link blockage and interference, thereby improving link range and the number of concurrent transmissions. Additionally, we propose a simple link scheduler and use traffic simulations to show that these 3D links significantly expand wireless capacity compared to their 2D counterparts.

## 1. Introduction
Modern distributed applications running in clusters and data centers can operate at a massive scale, with tens of thousands of servers spread across hundreds of racks. The bandwidth requirements of these applications range from modest (e.g., hundreds of Mb/s per server) to substantial (e.g., tens of Gb/s per server for high-end scientific computing). Delivering such bandwidth comes at a significant cost for the required switching infrastructure. 

Recent efforts have explored more efficient data center network topologies. While these alternate topologies offer various benefits, they also present inherent challenges. Large-scale networks require multiple "stages," meaning a multiplicative factor in the number of fibers/wires needed for each server. Planning, routing, deploying, testing, and repairing tens of thousands of fibers at the scale of a building incurs substantial costs, both in capital and operational expenditures. This manual overhead often delays the operational time of large clusters by weeks or months, resulting in lost machine depreciation and opportunity costs.

Wired deployments typically cannot anticipate bandwidth requirements for every rack and must overdeploy fiber for the "worst case" rather than the average case, increasing costs and maintenance. Modifying deployed networks is extremely costly and complex, especially in multi-stage network topologies. Adding fiber to an existing cluster is a complex process that incurs substantial delays and is sometimes infeasible.

While wired networks, whether electrical or optical, provide tremendous bandwidth, many applications, as shown by recent measurement studies, have more modest or localized/bursty bandwidth requirements. We focus on high-throughput, beamforming wireless links in the 60 GHz band. The unlicensed 60 GHz band offers multi-Gbps data rates and can be implemented with relatively low-cost hardware. Because 60 GHz signals attenuate quickly with distance, multiple wireless links can be deployed in a single data center.

Our goal is to expand the effective bandwidth of 60 GHz links to create a new primitive that can either augment existing networks with on-demand links or potentially replace wired links in data centers with modest bandwidth requirements. We build on earlier work that proposed 60 GHz links to alleviate hotspots in data centers.

However, earlier efforts face several limitations. Beamforming directional links experience signal leakage, producing a cone of interference that limits the number of active links in densely occupied data centers. These links also require direct LOS between sender and receiver and can be blocked by small objects, limiting their range to neighboring top-of-rack radios. Augmenting core links would require multiple hops through a line-of-sight 60 GHz network, leading to throughput drops, higher levels of congestion, and additional delays.

To address these issues, we investigate the feasibility of 60 GHz 3D beamforming as a flexible wireless primitive in data centers. In 3D beamforming, a top-of-rack directional antenna forms a wireless link by reflecting a focused beam off the ceiling towards the receiver. This reduces interference, avoids blocking obstacles, and provides an indirect LOS path for reliable communication. Such a system requires only beamforming radios readily available today, and near-perfect reflection can be provided by simple flat metal plates mounted on the ceiling.

3D beamforming has several advantages over prior "2D" approaches. Bouncing the beam off the ceiling extends the reach of radio signals by avoiding blocking obstacles, significantly reduces interference, and allows more nearby flows to transmit concurrently. It also extends the effective range of each link, allowing any two racks to be connected in a single hop, mitigating the need for multihop links.

In this paper, we propose a 3D beamforming system for 60 GHz wireless transmissions in data centers. We extend prior work and use measurements from a local 60 GHz testbed to quantify and compare the performance of 3D and 2D beamforming links. Our results show that 3D beamforming works well in practice, experiencing zero loss in signal or throughput from reflection. We also describe a link scheduler for 3D beamforming systems that maximizes concurrent links while considering cumulative interference and antenna alignment delays. Finally, we use detailed simulations of data center traffic hotspots to quantify the performance of 3D beamforming systems. Our results show that 3D beamforming can connect all rack pairs in a single hop and significantly reduce overall data completion time for wired networks across a range of bisection bandwidths.

While wired networks will likely remain the preferred choice for high-end distributed computing, we believe that 3D beamforming can expand the applicability and benefits of wireless networking to a broader range of data center deployments.

## 2. 60 GHz: Limitations and Solutions
Modifying the topology of wired data centers is costly, complex, and sometimes infeasible. Administrators can introduce flexible point-to-point network links by adding wireless radios. Prior work has proposed using 60 GHz links to augment data center capacity. Figures 1(a)-(b) show a common deployment scenario where wireless radios are placed on top of each rack or container to connect pairs of top-of-rack (ToR) switches. However, data center managers remain skeptical about deploying wireless links despite their potential benefits.

In this section, we summarize prior work and use detailed experiments on a 60 GHz testbed to identify and quantify key limitations of current proposals.

### 2.1 60 GHz Links in Data Centers
Existing designs adopt 60 GHz wireless technologies for several reasons. The 7GHz spectrum available in this band can deliver the multi-Gbps data rates required by data centers. 60 GHz links operate at a high carrier frequency, which limits the interference they generate, making them beneficial for dense rack deployments. 60 GHz links can use beamforming to enhance link rate and further suppress interference. Beamforming is a physical layer technique that concentrates transmission energy in a specific direction. Today, 60 GHz beamforming radios are readily available and affordable, either as directional (horn) antennas or antenna arrays. They use mechanical or electronic mechanisms to achieve fine-grain directional control.

**A 60 GHz Testbed.** As an experimental platform for 60 GHz wireless projects, we built a small 60 GHz wireless testbed. To create a bidirectional 60 GHz link, we set two Gigalink 6451 radios from HXI Millimeter Wave Products to operate using frequency division on two frequency bands near 60 GHz, centered at 58.2 GHz and 61.9 GHz. A simple On-Off-Keying modulation method delivers up to 1.25 Gbps of bandwidth, but actual throughput is limited to 1 Gbps by the radio's fiber-optic Gigabit Ethernet interface.

These radios were originally designed for long-distance wireless links and are equipped with a 60 GHz transceiver and a 41dBi directional antenna transmitting at 10 dBm power. For our short-distance data center experiments, HXI engineers modified the radio amplifier to reduce output power to 0 dBm. We also replaced the 41dBi antenna with a lower gain antenna to better suit the data center environment.
