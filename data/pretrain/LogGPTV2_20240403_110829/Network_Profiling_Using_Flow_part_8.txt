names of the external addresses to which they connect. For servers, try resolving the address of
the server itself. Use any of the other validation methods from Section 5.7.2 to help with this.
Many sites have information on ports and their corresponding protocols.
Throughout the process of cataloging unfamiliar and low-traffic assets, you may spend a great
deal of time researching ports and protocols or examining traffic in detail. This is a very valuable
part of the profiling process because it allows you to get an accurate picture of what the asset is
really doing on the network.
6.2 Example Findings
While profiling the leftovers, you may find all kinds of random and interesting traffic to or from
hosts on the network. Remember to note these findings in the profile, even if they are difficult to
verify or seem incorrect. This information can always be looked into in more detail during a
further investigation. If it was difficult to verify an asset, note that in the profile also.
Here are some examples of traffic that can be found in the leftovers.
• services already profiled
When the common services were profiled in Section 5, the assets included were limited to
those comprising at least 1% of the traffic for that service. That was done because assets
making up less than that percentage were assumed to be using or providing that service for
secondary purposes. However, sometimes even the assets making up such a small percentage
of traffic are actually using or providing the service as a primary purpose. This is particularly
CMU/SEI-2012-TR-006 | 48
likely when two or three very heavily used assets skew the percentages, as was the case with
the web servers on the sample network.
• common services over encrypted ports or legacy ports
Some services may use a separate port for encrypted connections or may still be using a port
that has since been changed. This is simply a matter of including the port in the filter.
• other well-known services
There are far too many well-known services in use today to list in this report. Protocols such
as NTP, RDP, LDAP, SMB, and sqlnet may show up on the network. At some point, verify
that these services are appropriate for the network. For example, NetBIOS, LDAP, and SMB
traffic should not be crossing the network perimeter.
• routers
Because you included protocols other than TCP and UDP using the process in this section,
some routing traffic may be visible. It should be fairly easy to tell which router is the internet
gateway by the specific protocols used.
• uncommon or uncategorized ports
Sometimes an asset will generate traffic for a seemingly random service. For example, in the
sample network, the only traffic found to and from one of the assets consisted of updates for
a mobile GPS based on the registered port number used. This particular asset was not noted
in the profile because the overall volume was insignificant.
Do not spend too much time on the assets in this category. Rather than examining traffic
details and researching port numbers, simply list the ports and addresses in the profile.
6.3 Results
All of the assets found in the talkers section (4) are now profiled. For the sample network, we
added many of the assets classified in this section to other sections in the final profile (see
Appendix A). Specifically, we listed many in the web server and VPN sections. Table 22 shows
the assets we found using the process in this section before we added them to the final table.

7 Maintain the Profile
Networks, especially large ones, can change quickly and often. The new profile you created using
the process in this report may not be accurate six months from now. Much of what was done
throughout this report can be automated. Particular netflow analysis software may allow for
scheduling filters to run weekly or monthly or at least allow for saving any custom filters created
during the process. Filters for command-line tools like SiLK can be rolled into a script and then
run as part of a cron job. It may be wise to have the tool send an email alert when it finds
something that is not already in the profile or when one of the assets in the profile has not been
active for a long time.
Automated tools can only do so much. You will need to consistently validate potential assets for a
particular service before adding them to the profile. This may seem daunting, but the more
consistently you do it, the quicker it will become. Also, consistently updating and validating new
assets will keep communication lines open between you and the people who administer the
network. Most importantly, this will help you stay informed as assets are removed, added, or
updated.
Update the profile at least once a month. One way to do this is to run through the whole profiling
process again (automated or not), find top talkers on the network, find potential assets for each
service, validate those assets, expand the data set, and profile the leftovers. Only the assets that
change will need to be validated. Any assets that have been added, removed, or changed should
stand out and can be further investigated.
Another way to update the profile is to look at trends over time. Use the current profile as a
baseline and take a daily snapshot of the assets (the services they are running and the external
addresses with which they are communicating) as well as the list of active assets on the network.
This is called “trending.” Use trending to visualize when changes are made and whether they are
persistent changes that should be added into the profile. Many analysis packages come with
trending capabilities. Trending scripts for SiLK can be downloaded that show changes over time
using graphs. This is probably the best option for updating the profile because it takes less time
and requires little effort. However, changes in trends still need to be validated before being added
to the profile.

8 Conclusion
Having an accurate list of assets and a network map can be a powerful tool when it comes time to
makes changes in the network, buy new equipment, respond to an incident, or conduct a security
assessment. For the profile to have even more of an impact, consider adding more data points.
You can list the machine administrator, update schedule, intended purpose, certificate registrar if
applicable, and anything else pertaining to administration or security. For instance, findings can
be correlated with an asset management database.
Profiling is also the first step in anomaly detection. You may have discovered during this process
that there was at least one machine doing something for which it was not intended. For example, a
web server may also be used to send and receive email, or an email server may violate policy with
regular telnet traffic. Go through the profile and make a list of security issues like these by
comparing the profile with what should be on the network. Use this list to guide a security audit or
stress to administration the importance of network profiling.
The profiling process has certain limitations, such as basing services on port number, which is not
always accurate because the standard is not enforced. Also, it relies on sensor placement to get
accurate results. As long as you are aware of these limitations, you can use judgment and
knowledge of networking to overcome them.
Use these results to report on what changes need to be made within the network and why. You
might also suggest organizational policies or procedures that will help keep records up to date and
prevent machines from being used for unintended purposes. You may even be able to find
inefficiencies in the network that can be corrected to save resources, such as combining two
separate low-volume email and web servers onto the same machine. Whatever the original goal of
profiling the network was, you can be sure to find other benefits from this process.
