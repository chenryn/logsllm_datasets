I am finding that running numpy.convolve with versions >= 1.14.6 automatically
launches the job on all available CPUs/threads. Is this bug? This is not the
behavior for numpy <= 1.14.5.
### Reproducing code example:
    import numpy as np
    movingAvg = np.convolve(data, window, "same")
### Numpy/Python version information:
('1.14.6', '2.7.12 (default, Nov 12 2018, 14:36:49) \n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609]')
