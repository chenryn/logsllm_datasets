Hello guys, im facing a problem which im not sure if it`s a Bug on THREE.js or
it`s really how Points works.. consider the following code:
    var maxPoints = 10;
    var group = new THREE.Group();
    for (var i = 0; i < maxPoints; i++) {
      var x = Math.random();
      var y = Math.random();
      var z = Math.random();
      var geometry: new THREE.BufferGeometry(),
      var vertices: new Float32Array(maxPoints * 3),
      vertices[i * 3 + 0] = x;
      vertices[i * 3 + 1] = y;
      vertices[i * 3 + 2] = z;
      var attribute = new THREE.BufferAttribute(vertices, 3).setDynamic(true);
      geometry.addAttribute('position', attribute);
      geometry.setDrawRange(i, 1); 
    // i only want to display one point if i dont set this i end up with 2 points, 
    // 1 at a random position and one at the center (0,0,0) for all objects in the group
      group.add(new THREE.Points(geometry));
    }
    ...
    scene.add(group);
The Problem im facing is that by creating a Point using BufferGeometry i
always end up with 2 points, one always at the center and another randomly
positioned. so if i am to create 1000 points i end up with 2000, been 2000
centered at the coordinates (0,0,0). It`s not 2000 Instance of Points but 1000
instance with 2 dots each, which i dont know how to make it only draw one,
i temporarily fixed it by setting drawRange, but i surely think it`s not the
right way, as i end up with a array with lots and lots of 0 values for the
bufferposition for each point..
