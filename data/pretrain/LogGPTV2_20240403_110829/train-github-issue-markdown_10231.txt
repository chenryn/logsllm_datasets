I am trying to use scipy.spatial.distance.cdist  
I can import scipy but cannot call or import scipy.spatial  
I have searched the web and found other posts similar to this but none have
worked for me. I tried different versions of scipy, numpy and python itself. I
continue to get the error shown in the image below. I do not appear to have
_fblas.py. I searched the C drive of my computer and all it returned was
test_fblas.py, which is present in the test folder within the scipy folder. I
appreciate any help leading to the resolution of this hours long quest.
