I am attempting to use the `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist` function, but I am encountering an issue. While I can successfully import `scipy`, I am unable to import or call `scipy.spatial`. I have searched online and found several posts related to this problem, but none of the suggested solutions have worked for me.

I have tried different versions of `scipy`, `numpy`, and Python itself, but I continue to receive the error shown in the image below. Additionally, it appears that I do not have the `_fblas.py` file. I searched my C drive and only found `test_fblas.py` in the `test` folder within the `scipy` directory.

I would greatly appreciate any assistance in resolving this issue, as I have been struggling with it for hours.
