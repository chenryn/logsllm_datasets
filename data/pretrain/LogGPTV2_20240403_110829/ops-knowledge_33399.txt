Assistant: This log chunk is from a system log and contains information about the kernel, discovery, and double-hummer alignment exceptions. The kernel is reporting information about iar and dear values, CE symbols, and ddr errors. The discovery is reporting node card status and voltage rail information. Lastly, the log is reporting double-hummer alignment exceptions with increasing frequency.
