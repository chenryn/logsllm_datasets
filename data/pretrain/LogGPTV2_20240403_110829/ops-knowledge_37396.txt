User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 disk_spill 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This is a function that checks whether there is a possibility of disk spill during the execution of SQL. If the plan parse information is not available, it checks whether the sort spill count or hash spill count exceeds the sort rate threshold. If the plan parse information is available, it calculates the total cost of the plan and checks whether the cost rate of the sort or hash operators exceeds the cost rate threshold. If abnormal operator details are found and the sort or hash spill count is greater than 0, it indicates that the SORT/HASH operation may spill to disk. The suggestion is to analyze whether the business needs to adjust the size of the work_mem parameter. If disk spill is detected, it is a root cause, otherwise it is not a root cause.
