If you have multiple classes in the same module namespace but defined in
different files (or even just different `module` blocks) TypeScript's `tsc`
will wrap every one of them into its own nest of IIFEs; one for each level of
namespace nesting.
For deep namespace hierarchies this produces large amounts of code that
increases code size and hurts parsing / loading performance.
To solve this problem, we use a post processing tool
(https://github.com/tschneidereit/typescript-module-merger) to merge
subsequent modules that appear in the same namespace. This is not a sound
optimization but works well in practice. Such a feature should be part of the
TypeScript compiler, perhaps under a compiler flag.
