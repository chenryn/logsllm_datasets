User: Please explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.
Assistant: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol for transferring data between web browsers and web servers. It is a stateless protocol, which means that each request is independent, and the server does not keep any previous requests or state information. HTTP is a clear text protocol, and the data is not encrypted when it is sent, so the data can be easily eavesdropped and tampered with. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure Sockets Layer) is a secure version of HTTP that provides a secure communication mechanism and data integrity. HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt data transmission, thereby protecting user privacy and data security. HTTPS uses public key encryption and private key decryption technology during data transmission, which can prevent data from being eavesdropped or tampered with by middlemen. Simply put, HTTP is an insecure protocol, while HTTPS is HTTP that ensures security by encrypting data and using certificates. In order to ensure data security, many websites use the HTTPS protocol, especially websites that require input of personal information, login account, online banking, payment and other operations, such as banks, payment platforms, e-commerce, etc.
