 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
One mysql table can be updated by the results of another table but the  
mysql UPDATE statement requires all tables referenced  
viz:  
UPDATE T1,T2 SET T1.col = T2.col WHERE T1.id = T2.id  
and not (as sqla currently does)  
UDPDATE T1 SET T1.col = T2.col WHERE T1.id = T2.id  
which produces an error
The attached python code uses the excellent sqla compiler to  
enhance the Update compiler but the changes are so trivial I think  
they should go into dialects/mysql/base.py
