In   [15],  a  SEU-tolerant  latch  is  proposed  based  on 
redundancy in circuit level (Figure 5). This latch includes 
two identical parts, one is the original part and the other is 
the  redundant  part.  Each  part  contains  two  cascaded 
Figure 4. Gate level schematic of a TMR-latch 
inverters similar to the conventional latch discussed in the 
previous  section.  The  first  inverter  is  a  CMOS  inverter 
and the second one is a C2MOS inverter which plays the 
role  of  the  inverter  and  the  transmission  gate  in  the 
conventional latch. Separating the input of n-type and p-
type transistors of the all inverters is the key idea of this 
design. As it can been seen in Figure 5, the gate of the p-
type transistor T1 in the first inverter (CMOS inverter) is 
connected to node N1 and the gate of its n-type transistor 
T2  is  connected  to  node  N3  (from  the  redundant  part). 
The  separation  has  also  been  applied  to  the  second 
inverter  (C2MOS  inverter)  as  well  as  inverters  in  the 
redundant part.  
It  should  be  noted  that  as  the  original  and  the 
redundant  part  are  identical,  the  nodes  N1,  N3  and  also 
the  nodes  N2,  N4  have  the  same  values  in  the  normal 
circuit  operation  (without  any  SEUs).  As  mentioned 
before,  the  SEU  cannot  alter  two  different  parts  of  the 
circuit  simultaneously.  Based  on  this  fact,  by  the  use  of 
separation technique, i.e. providing the input of p- and n-
type transistor in the inverters from different parts of the 
circuit,  the  propagation  of  the  SEU  effect  toward  the 
output will be canceled.  
The main drawback of this technique is that it is only 
efficient in the case of low energy particle strikes and if a 
relatively high energy particle strikes a sensitive region of 
the  circuit,  the  output  will  be  affected.  That  is  because; 
the CMOS and C2MOS inverters in which the inputs of t 
p-type and n-type transistors are separated cannot act as a 
filter when a high voltage is applied to one of their inputs. 
For the sake of clarity, the Figures 6 to 8 demonstrate the 
circuit level schematic and behavior of a separated CMOS 
inverter (a CMOS inverter with two separated inputs for 
p- and n-type transistors) when a high and a low energy 
particles strike one of its inputs. 
Suppose that the input A and B of the inverter shown 
in  Figure  6  are  "0"  and  a  transient  pulse  occurs  in  the 
input A at time 4 ns and lasts for about 1 ns. It can be seen 
in Figure 7.a that there is a low voltage drop, while a low 
energy SEU is injected to the input A of the inverter. In 
this case, the output is still interpreted as "1".

Figure 10. The proposed latch in [9] 
In contrast, as represented in Figure 7.b the output of 
the  inverter  has  significantly  changed  due  to  a  high 
energy  particle  strike.  The  main 
this 
phenomenon  is  that  the  produced  current  between  drain 
and source of the transistor increases quadratically by the 
rise in the gate voltage of the transistor  [26].  Therefore 
most of the collected charge in the output capacitance is 
discharged  through  the  n-type  transistor.  Based  on  the 
reason  of

latch (Figure 13). 
According  to  Figure  13,  in  the  SEU-free  case,  the 
output of the latch becomes "0" at about 3 ns and is never 
changed.  But  after  SEU-injection  at  about  4.5  ns  in  the 
output of the latch, the high voltage rise (about 10 volts) 
caused by SEU-injection cannot be recovered to the error-
free output, i.e., a soft error has been occurred in the latch.  
 [27] exploits a similar technique used in the previously 
mentioned  latch.  As  it  was  mentioned,  if  a  transient 
occurs  in  the  output  of  the  proposed  latch  in   [28],  its 
effect  will  propagate  through  the  both  feedback  lines, 
resulting in a soft error. The proposed latch in  [27] tries to 
address this issue by separating the feedback lines of the 
latch both at their start and end points, nodes N2, N3 and 
N4, N5 respectively (see Figure 14).  
To reach the aim, a two-output inverter which is shown 
in  Figure  14  is  used.  In  the  two-output  inverter  both  p- 
and n-type transistors are duplicated to provide two same 
distinct outputs (nodes N4 and N5). As shown in Figure 
14 the latch has two inputs, one of them is the incoming 
signal and the other one is the delayed version of that. The 
delay value is chosen to be longer than the summation of 
the setup time and duration of the probable transient pulse 
to ensure that at least one input is correct. This makes the 
latch robust to the transient pulse at its inputs. 
Now  suppose  that  the  input  value  is  "0".  While  the 
clock signal is in its positive level, the input passes via the 
two  first  transmission  gates  to  the  nodes  N4  and  N5. 
When the clock signal goes to the negative level the first 
two  transmission  gates  become  off  and  the  second  one 
becomes on, then the output of the latch is connected to 
the  node  N1  via  the  second  transmission  gate  and  the 
latch enters to its keeping phase. In the other words, the 
feedbacks are constructed to keep the output value. In this 
phase the value of the nodes N2 and N3 are the same and 
equal to "0", thereby the p-type transistors T5 and T6 are 
on, the n-type transistors T7 and T8 are off and the values 
of the nodes N1 and output become "1". In this situation, 
the transistors T3 and T4 conduct and the node N5 gets 
value "0". The node N4 which is the dual of the node N5, 
retains  its  previous  value  from  the  writing  phase  of  the 
latch (when the clock signal was in positive level) which 
is "0". 
above  discussion,  a  transient  pulse  on  susceptible  nodes 
of this latch such as nodes N1, N2, N3 and N4 causes a 
transient pulse in the output of the corresponding inverters 
and this transient is latched through the constructed loop 
in the keeping phase of the latch. It is also in agreement 
with the simulation results. 
Figure  9  represents  the  simulation  results  of  SEU-
injection into susceptible nodes of this latch (nodes N1 to 
N4 of Figure 5). As it can be seen, after SEU-injection the 
output  is  different  from  the  error-free  output  (output 
without the presence of SEU). The SEU-injection results 
imply that the used inverters in this latch do not filter the 
effect of SEU occurred in one of their inputs in the case of 
a high energetic particle strike. 
The very similar approach is used in the SEU-tolerant 
latch proposed in  [9]. As shown in Figure 10, separation 
of the used inverters inputs is also employed in this design 
to prevent the propagation of the SEU effect toward the 
output.  Similar  to  the  previous  latch,  this  SEU-tolerant 
latch is also incapable to suppress the SEU effect caused 
by  high  energy  particles.  The  simulation  results  of  SEU 
injection to a susceptible node of this latch (node N4) is 
presented in Figure 11. As it can be seen, a high voltage 
drop in the node N4 due to high energy particle causes the 
latch to produce erroneous output.  
To  overcome  the  problem  of  the  two  previously 
discussed  latches,  a  C-element  which  was  described  in 
section 2 is employed in the proposed latch in  [28]. The 
transistor level structure of this latch is shown is  Figure 
12, in the normal operation (without any SEU) the input 
of  the  latch  is  propagated  to  the  output  through  the  C-
element and two used feedback paths (in positive level of 
clock signal). Since both internal nodes N1 and N2 have 
the same logic value, only one of the pair transistors (T1 
and T2 or T3 and T4) are always on, thereby the inverted 
input value passes to the output of the latch. In case of a 
SEU  affects one of the latch internal nodes N1 or N2, the 
output  does  not  flip  even  if  the  particle  energy  is  high. 
That is because; the C-element retains its previous value 
if  its  two  inputs  are  in  different  values  (see  section  2). 
Therefore a transient occurred in node N1 or N2 can only 
affect pair transistors (T1, T3 or T2, T4). In this case, the 
C-element does not pass the produced transient voltage to 
its  output  and  enters  to  its  filtering  mode.  However  the 
main weakness of this latch is its inability of tolerating the 
transient  occurred  in  the  output  of  the  latch  (node  N3). 
For the sake of clarity suppose that the output value of the 
latch is "0" and a SEU forces the output (node N3) to be 
"1" momentarily. Since the node N3 is connected to both 
nodes N1 and N2, the produced transient voltage reaches 
all  the  transistors  of  C-element,  accordingly  it  does  not 
filter this transient and the incorrect value will be stored 
inside the latch. By the use of the C-element in this way, 
two  feedback  lines  are  only  isolated  in  their  end  points 
(nodes  N1  and  N2).  But  they  still  have  the  same  start
