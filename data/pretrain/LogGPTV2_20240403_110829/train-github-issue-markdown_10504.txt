##### Detailed description
The gstreamer implementation in videoio module uses CV_ERROR() on open()
instead of just returning false like all other implementations. This causes an
exception to be thrown, but in projects where exceptions are disabled we
cannot have that - exceptions are just handled as crashes. But in this case an
error can be thrown only if a file doesn't exist or if a pipeline is wrong. In
our software we have a modular api that allows several pipelines in a priority
order - if a pipeline cannot be used it goes to the next one. It doesn't work
because the first pipeline crashes instead of returning false like the ffmpeg,
dshow or any other implementation. This is clearly an inconsistency in OpenCV
api.
##### Steps to reproduce
        int main() {
          cv::VideoCapture cap("shmsrc /tmp/socket ! video/x-raw, 1920, 1080, 1/60, format=UYVY ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw, BGR ! appsink sync=true"); 
        }
That will crash if the socket doesn't exist. It would be good if it returned
false if used with Open() and just set internally as not-running, so we could
check with isOpened.
