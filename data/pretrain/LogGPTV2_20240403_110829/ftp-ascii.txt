Sets the file transfer type to ASCII. The ftp command supports both ASCII (default) and binary image file transfer types, but we recommend using ASCII when transferring text files. In ASCII mode, character conversions to and from the network standard character set are performed. For example, end-of-line characters are converted as necessary, based on the target operating system.
