### FTP ASCII Mode

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `ascii` command sets the file transfer type to ASCII. The FTP protocol supports both ASCII (default) and binary image file transfer types. It is recommended to use ASCII mode when transferring text files. In ASCII mode, character conversions are performed between the local and network standard character sets. For example, end-of-line characters are converted as necessary, based on the target operating system.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
ascii
```

**Examples:**
To set the file transfer type to ASCII, enter the following command:
```plaintext
ascii
```

This will ensure that text files are transferred with the appropriate character conversions, maintaining their integrity across different operating systems.
