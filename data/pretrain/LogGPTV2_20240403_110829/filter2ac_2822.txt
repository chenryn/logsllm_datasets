**Title: Preventing Authentication Bypass: A Tale of Two Researchers**

"I discovered a critical security issue that allows an attacker to compromise any user's account without any user interaction." Join Terry Zhang, Ron Chen, and a Microsoft engineer as they present the coordinated public disclosure of a critical elevation of privilege vulnerability. This session will recount the story of two security researchers who independently discovered the same vulnerability, leading to an emergency response investigation. 

Attendees will gain insights into the techniques used by the researchers to identify the vulnerability, learn how companies can effectively collaborate with researchers throughout the disclosure process to protect their customers, and understand what application developers can do to write more secure code for web applications, thereby avoiding similar flaws.
