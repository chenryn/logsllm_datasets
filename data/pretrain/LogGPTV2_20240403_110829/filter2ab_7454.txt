**Title: The Art of Exploiting UAF by Ret2bpf in the Android Kernel**

In early 2021, an external researcher reported to Google a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability (CVE-2021-0399) in the `xt_qtaguid` kernel module, which is used for monitoring network socket status. This vulnerability had existed for over a decade but was only identified through three lines of code. The researcher did not provide additional information or a Proof of Concept (PoC) and noted that the vulnerability might be unexploitable on some Android devices due to the presence of the `CONFIG_ARM64_UAO` configuration.

To assess the exploitability of this vulnerability, the Google Android Security team conducted a thorough investigation. In this presentation, we will:

1. **Review the History of Vulnerabilities in `xt_qtaguid`:** We will examine known vulnerabilities in the `xt_qtaguid` module, including the recently reported UAF, to provide context and historical insight.
   
2. **Explore Exploitation Techniques:** We will discuss several methods to exploit the kernel using this UAF bug. Specifically, we will detail how to bypass `CONFIG_ARM64_UAO` using the `ret2bpf` technique. A video demonstration will be provided, showing a successful local privilege escalation attack on a Mi9 device running the latest version of Android Pie with modern kernel protections enabled.

3. **Discuss Additional Mitigations:** We will also cover the mitigations implemented in current Android versions that would prevent the exploitation described here. Additionally, we will share what Google knows about this vulnerability and introduce the static and dynamic detection methods, including the use of eBPF, that Google employs to identify and mitigate Android exploit samples.

By the end of the presentation, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the measures in place to protect against such exploits.
