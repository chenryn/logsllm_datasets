User: I'm using Python, for what it's worth, but will accept answers in any applicable language.
I've tried writing to /proc/$pid/cmdline, but that's a readonly file.
I've tried assigning a new string to sys.argv[0], but that has no perceptible impact.
Are there any other possibilities?  My program is executing processes via os.system (equivalent to system(3)) so a general, *NIX-based solution using an additional spawning process would be fine.
Assistant: If you use subprocess.Popen instead of os.system you can use the executable argument to specify the path to the actual file to execute, and pass the name you want to show as the first item in the list that is parameter args.
