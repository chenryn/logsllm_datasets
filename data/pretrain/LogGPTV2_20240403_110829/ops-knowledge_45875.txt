User: I know Ruby right now, however I want to learn a new language. I am running Ubuntu 10.04 right now but I am going to get a Mac later this summer. Anyways I want something more for GUI development. I was wondering if I should learn C on Ubuntu right now, and then learn Objective-C when I get an iMac? Will learning C give me an edge? Or should I just learn Python on Ubuntu and then learn Objective-C when I get a new computer?
Assistant: Sure Objective-C is quite easier to learn if you know C and quite a few books on Objective-C even asume you know C.
Also consider learning a bit about MacRuby for GUI development ;)
