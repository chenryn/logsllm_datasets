Certainly! If you are currently familiar with Ruby and are looking to learn a new language, especially for GUI development, there are a few options to consider.

1. **Learning C on Ubuntu:**
   - Learning C will provide you with a strong foundation in programming, as it is a low-level language that gives you a deep understanding of how computers work. This knowledge can be very beneficial when you transition to Objective-C, as Objective-C is built on top of C.
   - Many resources and books on Objective-C assume prior knowledge of C, so learning C now will make your transition smoother.

2. **Transitioning to Objective-C on a Mac:**
   - Once you get your iMac, you can start learning Objective-C. The transition from C to Objective-C will be easier because of the shared syntax and concepts.
   - Objective-C is primarily used for macOS and iOS development, making it a great choice if you plan to develop applications for Apple platforms.

3. **Alternative: Learning Python on Ubuntu:**
   - Python is another excellent language for GUI development. It has several libraries and frameworks, such as Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivy, which make it easy to create graphical user interfaces.
   - Python is also widely used and has a large community, making it easier to find resources and support.

4. **Consider MacRuby:**
   - If you want to leverage your existing Ruby skills, you might also consider MacRuby. MacRuby is a Ruby implementation that runs on the macOS platform and integrates well with Cocoa, the native framework for macOS and iOS development.
   - This could be a good option if you prefer to continue working with Ruby while still developing GUI applications.

In summary, learning C on Ubuntu now will give you a solid foundation and an edge when you transition to Objective-C on your iMac. Alternatively, if you prefer a more high-level and versatile language, learning Python on Ubuntu and then transitioning to Objective-C or exploring MacRuby could also be a viable path.
