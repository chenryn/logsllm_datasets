# Key Metrics and Observations

- **Enumeration**: 0.912
- **Exploitation**: 0.964
- **Keystroke Internal**: 0.572
- **Command Interval**: 0.58
- **Backspace Variable**: 0.702
- **Optimal Model (Navigation & Enumeration)**: 1.0

## Implications

### Observations and Comparisons

- **High Levels of Consistency and Distinctiveness**:
  - Navigation and enumeration combined.
  - No need for exploitation in this study.
  - Navigation is a daily, ingrained behavior, while enumeration and exploitation are specific to attacks.

- **Accuracy and Stability**:
  - Higher accuracy compared to other crime types.
  - Behaviors less subject to influence are more stable.
  - Nature of the offense: offenders are less likely to be influenced.
  - Broader approaches may change, but granular command choices, especially navigation, remain consistent.

- **Metadata Variables**:
  - Significantly weaker than typing patterns.
  - What you type has greater linking power than how you type.
  - Latency may affect results, but mistakes and typos show promise and need further exploration.

## Implications for Investigators

- **Linking Offenses to Common Offenders**:
  - Can link separate offenses without atomic or computed IOCs.
  - Requires extensive information, as detailed as possible.
  - Previous CLA/attribution work often required limited, specific information (Bennell & Canter, 2002; Hutchins et al., 2010; Clark & Landau, 2011).

- **Data Capture**:
  - Need to capture commands and keystrokes.
  - High-interaction honeypots, verbose logging, backdoored CTFs, or vulnerable VMs can be used.

- **Training and Certifications**:
  - Can link attackers who trained together or have similar certifications.
  - Sample commands and code can dilute the assumption of distinctiveness but still assist with attribution.

## Privacy Implications

- **Behavioral Linkage**:
  - People can be linked to separate hosts/identities based on approaches, syntax, and commands.
  - Anonymizing measures and good OPSEC elsewhere do not prevent linkage.
  - Similar to forensic linguistics, it exploits stable behavioral traits, though not 100% accurate.
  - Fewer people can operate a command line compared to being literate (approximately 86% literacy rate).

- **Behavioral Traits**:
  - This study focused on commands but may also apply to:
    - Typos and correction methods.
    - Capital formation.
    - Use of PgDn/PgUp, arrow keys, tabs/spaces, keyboard shortcuts, and bracket types.

- **Keystroke Logging**:
  - If someone can log your keystrokes, they can identify you.
  - This method is more about attribution via linkage, linking you to historical or future activity.
  - Used to build a repository of command profiles.

## Defeating CLA

- **Conscious Disguise**:
  - Similar to defeating authorship identification, make a conscious decision to disguise your style.
  - Forensic linguistics solutions range from crude (e.g., Google Translate) to sophisticated (e.g., automated changes to sentence construction and synonym substitution).
  - CLA is different; alias commands won't work, and it's hard to automate due to the unpredictability of commands.
  - Semi-automation using scripts is possible.

- **Google Translate Example**:
  - Translating text through multiple languages (e.g., English -> Norwegian -> French -> Afrikaans -> Romanian -> Japanese -> English) can significantly alter the original text.
  - Example: "People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy." becomes "U wot m8."

- **Best Practices**:
  - Randomize the ordering of command switches.
  - Switch up tools used (e.g., wget instead of curl, vi instead of nano, less instead of cat).

## Threats to Validity

- **Sample Size and Data**:
  - Very small sample size.
  - Not real-world data; attackers were willing volunteers who knew they had permission with no risk of reprisal.
  - Linux only, one scenario (low-priv shell), and attackers may not always want/need to escalate.

## Future Research

- **Topics for Further Exploration**:
  - Effects of expertise and temporal proximity.
  - Metadata variables for mistakes.
  - Real-world data.
  - Stochastic analysis.
  - Greater environmental and scenario diversity.
  - Real-time or near real-time automation.
