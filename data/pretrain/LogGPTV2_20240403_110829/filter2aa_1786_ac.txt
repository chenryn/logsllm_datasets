• Enumeration = 0.912
• Exploitation = 0.964
• Keystroke internal = 0.572
• Command interval = 0.58
• Backspace variable = 0.702
• Optimal model (navigation & enumeration) = 1.0

Implications
• Observations & comparisons
• Investigation implications
• Privacy implications
• Defeating CLA
• Threats to validity
PwC │ 70
Observations & comparisons
• High levels of consistency and distinctiveness
• Navigation and enumeration combined
• No need for exploitation (in this study)
• Why was navigation specifically so prominent?
• Something everyone does, every day
• Enumeration & exploitation only done during attacks
• Navigation behaviours may be more ingrained
PwC │ 71
Observations & comparisons
• Higher accuracy than other crime types
• Behaviours less subject to influence may be more stable
• Nature of offence: offenders less likely to be influences
• Broader approach may change
• But possibly not granular command choice
• Especially navigation
PwC │ 72
Observations & comparisons
• Metadata variables significantly weaker
• What you type has greater linking power than how you type
• Latency may have affected some of the results
• But mistakes/typos show some promise
• Needs further exploration
PwC │ 73
Implications for investigators
• Can link separate offences to common offenders
• With no atomic or computed IOCs
• But need a lot of information
• Previous CLA/attribution work: limited, specific info required
• Bennell & Canter, 2002; Hutchins et al, 2010; Clark & Landau, 2011
• Here, need as much as possible
• As granular as possible
PwC │ 74
Implications for investigators
• Need to be in a position to capture commands/keystrokes
• High-interaction honeypots
• Verbose and detailed logging
• Backdoored CTFs or vulnerable VMs
PwC │ 75
Implications for investigators
• Could also link attackers who trained together
• Or who have all done a certain certification
• Sample commands and code
• Dilutes CLA assumption of distinctiveness
• But could still assist with attribution
PwC │ 76
Privacy implications
• People can be linked to separate hosts/identities
• Based on approaches, syntax, and commands
• Regardless of anonymising measures
• Regardless of good OPSEC elsewhere
PwC │ 77
Privacy implications
• Like forensic linguistics, exploits stable behavioural traits
• Won’t be 100% accurate obviously
• And affects less of the population, cp. forensic linguistics
• e.g. ~86% of the population is literate*
• Less people than that can operate a command-line
* https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ADT.LITR.ZS, 27/06/18
PwC │ 78
Privacy implications
• This study only focused on commands
• May also apply to:
• Typos, and the way you correct them
• How you form capitals
• Using PgDn/PgUp
• Using arrow keys rather than the mouse
• Tabs/spaces
• Keyboard shortcuts
• Use of, and preference for, bracket types
PwC │ 79
Privacy implications
• If someone can log your keystrokes, you have issues anyway
• But this is less about identification
• If someone can log your keystrokes, it’s not hard to find out who you are
• This is more about attribution via linkage
• Could be used to link you to historical/future activity
• Used to build up repository of command profiles
PwC │ 80
Defeating CLA
• Similar to defeating authorship identification
• Make a conscious decision to disguise your style
• Forensic linguistics: solutions range from crude (Google Translate) to 
sophisticated (automated changes to sentence construction, synonym 
substitution, etc)
• CLA different – e.g. alias command would not work
• Hard to automate – can’t predict commands in advance
• Could semi-automate, using scripts
PwC │ 81
Note on Google Translate
• @InsightfulRobot)created by colleague Keith Short (@ItsNotKeith)
• Turns: People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the 
more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed. 
Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward 
spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

PwC │ 83
Defeating CLA
• Conscious changes are probably the best way to do it
• Randomising ordering of command switches
• Switching up tools used e.g. wget instead of curl; vi instead of 
nano; less instead of cat
PwC │ 84
Threats to validity
• Very small sample
• Not real-world data
• Attackers were willing volunteers
• Knew they had permission, with no risk of reprisal
• Linux only
• One scenario (low-priv shell)
• Attackers may not always want/need to escalate

Future research
• Explore effects of expertise and temporal proximity
• Further research into metadata variables for mistakes
• Real-world data
• Stochastic analysis
• Greater environmental and scenario diversity
• Real-time or near real-time automation

Collaboration

Conclusion
• Small, novel study
• Some promising results
• Significant implications for defenders/investigators
• As well as implications for privacy
• Needs further investigation
