Hi,
I have (mocha) specs which have the same filename as the subject under test
and only another extension. Example: subject.js and subject.spec.js. Since the
AMD and the System formatter inherit from the Default formatter all file
extensions are removed. This results in duplicate module ids. How about making
the removal of the file extension or configurable? So that either I have
module ids matching the filenames or that just the last "extension" is
removed.
Thanks
