User: Please answer the following questions, what should I do if there is too much elasticsearch index data, and how to tune it
Assistant: Dynamic index level Create an index based on template + time + rollover api rolling, for example: design stage definition: the template format of the blog index is: blog_index_timestamp, and the data is incremented every day. The advantage of doing this is that the data volume of a single index will not be very large due to the surge of data volume, which is close to the 32nd power-1 of the upper line 2, and the index storage has reached TB+ or even larger. Once a single index is very large, various risks such as storage will follow, so think ahead and avoid it early. At the storage level, hot and cold data are stored separately, hot data (such as the data of the last 3 days or a week), and the rest are cold data. For cold data where no new data will be written, regular force_merge and shrink compression operations can be considered to save storage space and retrieval efficiency. Â· Once the deployment level has not been planned before, this is an emergency strategy. Combined with the feature of ES itself that supports dynamic expansion, the method of dynamically adding machines can relieve the pressure on the cluster. Note: If the master node and other planning are reasonable before, the dynamic addition can be completed without restarting the cluster.
