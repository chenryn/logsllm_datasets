Subject: Assistance Required: Building and Running Emesene on macOS

Dear Community,

I am seeking assistance with building and running the Emesene chat client, written in Python, on macOS. I have already obtained the source code from GitHub, but I have been unable to find a comprehensive and functional guide online.

I did come across some documentation on the sidhosting website, but unfortunately, it did not fully resolve my issue. 

Could someone please provide step-by-step instructions or point me towards a reliable resource for setting up Emesene on macOS? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Sumod

**Additional Information:**

- I have tried running `python setup.py install` in the Emesene directory, but I encountered issues. 
- If you have any specific steps or troubleshooting tips, please share them.

Best regards,
Sumod
