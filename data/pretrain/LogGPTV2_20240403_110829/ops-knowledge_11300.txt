User: Anyone knows how to build and run emesene - the chat client in Python - on OS X once you get the code from GitHub?
I have searched online and I cannot find a source that is working. I did find some documents on sidhosting website. But that did not work for me completely. Hence I need help here.
Thanks
Sumod
Assistant: Have you tried running python setup.py install in the emesene directory?
