**ATT&CK ID:** T1091  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Replication Through Removable Media

Adversaries may use removable media to propagate malware onto target systems, including those on disconnected or air-gapped networks. This technique involves copying malicious code onto the removable media and leveraging Autorun features to execute the code when the media is inserted into a system.

For **Lateral Movement**, adversaries may modify executable files stored on the removable media or copy malware and disguise it as legitimate files, thereby tricking users into executing it on another system. In the case of **Initial Access**, this can be achieved through manual manipulation of the media, tampering with systems used to initially format the media, or even by modifying the firmware of the media itself.
