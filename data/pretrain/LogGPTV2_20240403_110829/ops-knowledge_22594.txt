User: According to the following requirements, design a highly available web server architecture to ensure that it can automatically switch to a backup server when a server is down: The requirements are as follows:\n1. Each server has multiple network cards, one of which is used for the external network access, and another network card for internal communication. \n2. There are two servers, each running a web server, and they are able to communicate with each other. \n3. When a server goes down, the standby server can automatically take over the service and ensure data consistency. \n4. User requests can be evenly distributed to two servers to achieve load balancing.
Assistant: This problem can be solved using high availability clustering. The architecture is as follows: 1. Create a load balancer that takes user requests and distributes them to one of the two servers. 2. Install the same version of the web server on the two servers, and create a virtual IP (VIP) on each server to represent the service address of the web server. 3. Create a VIP address on the external network card of each server to receive requests from the load balancer. At the same time, set a static IP address on the internal network card of each server, and use this address for communication between Web servers. 4. Use protocols such as Pacemaker to configure the services on the Web server as cluster resources to ensure data consistency during failure recovery. There is a backup web server on each server to ensure that if one goes down, the other server can immediately take over the service. 5. Configure an automatic fault detection system to monitor each server and web server. If a certain server or web server fails, automatically switch to another server or web server. 6. If the primary server fails, the load balancer forwards the request to the web server on the backup server. The standby server will be promoted to active status and start accepting user requests. Using this architecture, highly available web server services can be achieved. If one of the servers or the web server fails, the system will automatically switch to the backup server and maintain data consistency. At the same time, the load balancer can ensure that requests can be evenly distributed to the two servers.
