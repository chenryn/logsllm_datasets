### D. Results

We present two different classifiers: one for authentication and one for identification. Both classifiers are based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The authentication classifier is designed to verify a 1:1 match between a sample from an unknown person and the requested personâ€™s stored biometric template. The identification classifier, also based on SVMs, verifies a 1:n match between a sample from a known person and all samples in a database. Our identification classifier is a closed-set classifier. For more details on open- and closed-set classifiers, refer to Section II.

Our findings are divided into results from a single test set, which demonstrates the inherent distinguishing power of our pulse-response biometric, and results from data sampled over time, which show the stability (permanence) of our biometric over a longer period.

#### 1. Authentication Classifier

Our authentication classifier is a 1:1 classifier based on SVMs. The performance of this classifier on our single-session data set is shown in Figure 9. Each bar represents the classifier's performance at different threshold levels for each of the ten test subjects. The threshold determines the confidence level required to accept a positive identification. A lower threshold can achieve higher sensitivity but may increase the false positive rate. The performance metrics are derived from 5-fold cross-validation to ensure statistical robustness. As seen in Figure 9, all subjects are recognized with a very high probability, as confirmed by the true positive rate.

In Figure 10, the stability of our authentication classifier is evaluated using a data set collected over several weeks. The results show that, even with a 10% false positive rate, we achieve a sensitivity of almost 100%.

#### 2. Identification Classifier

The identification task is a multi-class classification problem. Our classifier consists of multiple SVMs and follows a one-against-one approach, with aggregation by voting. Due to the increased complexity, we expect a slight drop in performance compared to the binary classification task of authentication.

- **Y-axis:** True positive rate
- **Error bars:** 95% confidence interval

When applied to the two different data sets, our identification classifier still performs well, as shown in Figure 11. In the single data set, the goal is to identify each of the ten people accurately. Despite the increased complexity, the classifier maintains high performance. There is a slight decrease in performance in the data set containing samples taken over time.

### Summary of Results

Table I summarizes the performance of our authentication and identification classifiers, averaged over all users. These performance figures are based on test data not involved in any development or training phase of the classifiers. Values for true/false positives/negatives are at the equal error rate (EER) of 0.00 on the single data set and EER = 1.12 over time.
