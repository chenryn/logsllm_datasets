D. Results
We present two different classiﬁers, one for authentication
and one for identiﬁcation. The authentication classiﬁer is based
on support vector machines (SVM) and solves the problem
of verifying a 1:1 match between a sample form an unknown
person and the requested person’s stored biometric template.
The identiﬁcation classiﬁer, also based on SVM, veriﬁes a 1:n
match between a sample from a known person against all the
samples in a database. Our identiﬁcation classiﬁer is a closed-
set classiﬁer. Refer to Section II for a more detailed description
of open- and closed-set classiﬁers.
We further divide our ﬁndings into results on a single test-
set, which shows the inherent distinguishing power of our
pulse-response biometric, and results of our classiﬁer when
applied to data sampled over time. The samples taken over
time show the stability (permanence) of our biometric over a
longer time period.
1) Authentication Classiﬁer: Our authentication classiﬁer
is a 1:1 classiﬁer based on SVM. The results of running this
classiﬁer on our single-session data set can be seen in Figure 9.
Each bar is the classiﬁers performance for different threshold
levels, for each of the ten test subjects. The threshold is a
measure of how sure you want to be that the identiﬁcation is
correct. If you can accept a small false positive rate a better
sensitivity can be achieved. The classiﬁer performance is the
result of 5-fold cross validation to ensure statistical robustness.
We see that all subjects are being recognized with a very high
probability as the true positive rate conﬁrms.

Fig. 11: The results of our identiﬁcation classiﬁer. The true
positive rate for each test subject is obtained by applying ﬁve
times stratiﬁed 5-fold cross-validation. The error bars show the
95% conﬁdence interval.
Figure 10 shows the stability performance of our authenti-
cation classiﬁer. In this ﬁgure the classiﬁer has been applied to
a data set collected over several weeks. Here we see a similar
picture. If we can accept, e.g., 10% false positives, we achieve
a sensitivity of almost 100%.
2) Identiﬁcation Classiﬁer: Identiﬁcation is a multi-class
classiﬁcation problem, our classiﬁer consists of multiple SVMs
and follows a one-against-one approach (aggregation by voting).
Due to this increased complexity we expect a slight drop in
performance in comparison to authentication, which is a binary
classiﬁcation task.
When we run our identiﬁcation classiﬁer on the two different
data sets we get the results shown in Figure 11. Even with the
increased complexity we see that our identiﬁcation classiﬁer still
performs very well on both data sets. In the single data set we
have ten people and the goal of the classiﬁer is to identify each
person as accurately as possible. In other words, distinguish
each person from everybody else. We see a slight decrease in
performance in the data set containing samples being taken

TABLE I: Summery of our results of the authentication
and identiﬁcation classiﬁers, averaged over all users. This
performance ﬁgures have been assessed on the basis of test
data not involved in any development or training phase of
the classiﬁers. Values for true/false positives/negatives are at
the equal error rate of EER = 0.00 on the single data set
and EER = 1.12 over time. For a more detailed view on the
performance of the classiﬁers see the ROC curves in Figure 12.
