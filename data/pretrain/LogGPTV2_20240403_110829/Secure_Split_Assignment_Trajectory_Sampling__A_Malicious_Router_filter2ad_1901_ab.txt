### Split Range Assignment Algorithm

**Definitions:**
- **PR**: A set of prime numbers, where `primei` is the i-th element.
- **Nrouter**: The total number of routers in the network.
- **Nsmall**: The number of hash values assigned to each router, calculated as `Nrouter - 1`.
- **Ntotal**: The smallest prime number greater than or equal to `(Nrouter - 1) / psamp`.
- **psamp**: The sampling probability.
- **Nsmall**: The number of hash values assigned to each router, calculated as `floor(Ntotal * psamp)`.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Determine Ntotal and Nsmall:**
   - Calculate `Ntotal` as the smallest prime number greater than or equal to `(Nrouter - 1) / psamp`.
   - Calculate `Nsmall` as `floor(Ntotal * psamp)`.

2. **Assign Hash Values:**
   - Each router is assigned `Nsmall` hash values such that each router shares one hash value with every other router in the network.
   - For example, if `psamp = 6/31` and `Nrouter = 7`, then `Ntotal = 31` (the smallest prime number greater than or equal to `(7 - 1) / (6/31) = 31`), and `Nsmall = floor(31 * 6/31) = 6`.

3. **Example:**
   - Router `rl` might share the hash values `13, 2, 25, 30, 5, and 9` with `r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, and r7`, respectively.

**Benefits:**
- Ensures that each pair of routers has at least one common hash value, allowing for comparison of samples from different routers.
- Reduces the probability that an attacker can avoid detection.

### Inconsistent Trajectories

**Detection Process:**
- **Premise:** If packets are manipulated, their trajectories will not be consistent with the predicted trajectories.
- **Trajectory Types:**
  - **Normal Trajectory (`tnormal`)**: The expected path of a packet from ingress to egress.
  - **Orphan Trajectory (`torphan`)**: A trajectory that starts without an origin point, indicating a modification or drop.

**Scenarios:**
1. **Packet Dropped at Node `ri`:**
   - The normal trajectory `tnormal` ends prematurely at `ri`.
2. **Packet Modified at Node `ri`:**
   - The normal trajectory `tnormal` ends prematurely at `ri` due to a label change.
   - A new orphan trajectory `torphan` may start if the modified packet's label falls within the sampling range of subsequent routers.

**Detection:**
- Early termination of normal trajectories and the presence of orphan trajectories are used to detect packet dropping and modification.

### Aggregation of Multiple Trajectories

**Aggregation Process:**
- **Flow Definition:** A flow is defined by the same ingress router and destination routing prefix pair.
- **Aggregation Benefits:**
  - **Scalability:** Aggregating trajectories reduces the computational load, especially in high-load scenarios.
  - **Threshold-Based Detection:** An alarm is raised only when the number of inconsistent trajectories exceeds a predefined threshold, which helps differentiate between legitimate packet drops and malicious attacks.

**Key Components:**
- **Primary Counter (`Cprim`)**: Counts the number of normal trajectories sampled from a specific hash value at each node.
- **Threshold (`THprim`)**: Used to determine if the decline in `Cprim` values indicates an anomaly.

**Example:**
- Figure 5 shows the pseudo code for the aggregation and detection algorithms.
- Figure 6 illustrates an example of the aggregation process, where the primary counter values help identify suspicious regions.

### Pinpointing Malicious Routers

**Suspicious Region:**
- A suspicious region is identified when the primary counter values show a significant decline beyond a certain node.
- **Scenarios:**
  1. **Node `ri` is benign, and node `rj` is benign:**
     - A previous node dropped the packets, and `rj` correctly reported not seeing them.
  2. **Node `rj` is malicious:**
     - `ri` forwarded the packets correctly, but `rj` did not report them.
  3. **Intermediate node between `ri` and `rj` is malicious:**
     - A router between `ri` and `rj` dropped the packets, and the hashes do not fall within the sampling ranges of any intermediate routers.

**Conclusion:**
- By assigning common hash values and using the primary counter, the system can effectively pinpoint the location of malicious activity and reduce false positives.
