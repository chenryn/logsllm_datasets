User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Auto start a program (and run under other account) on user logon I really like Mark Russinovich's Process Explorer so I'm always running it. I would like to automate this task of manually starting this process up every time I logon.

But I want this program to run as domain administrator even though I logon as a local user. The reason being is I can manage (kill) processes/services running under domain accounts.

So how do I do that?

I suppose if I create a local service using sc create command I won't be able to interact with Process Explorer then? Will I be able to see the icon in the task tray and open it etc etc?

So is this at all possible?

What I tried

I've tried two things:


Task scheduler
I tried scheduling a task after user logs on and set it's user to domain administrator. The program does seem to run, but I don't have any interactivity (the window) so I can't use it, can I...
sc create to create a service
Similar. No interactivity. And there was some other error as well.

Assistant: create a batch file or similar in a start-up folder with the contents:

runas /user:domain\admin C:\Path\To\ProcessExplorer.exe


Before rebooting, run

runas /savecred /user:domain\admin C:\Path\To\ProcessExplorer.exe


It will prompt you for the password only this one time; note that the admin password will be saved to your Windows profile (not usually a good idea); and this does not work for Win7 Home or Starter editions.
