negatives revealed examples of IXP addresses whose prefixes are
advertised globally into BGP, so they resolved to an IXP AS using
Cymru. However, PeeringDB resolved the individual IP to another
AS present at the IXP. Adding this step improved both rates. Mi-
crosoft data indicated our FDR lowered to 11% and FNR to 21%.
There exist opportunities to tune methodology to different trade-
offs between false positives and false negatives. For example, there
are networks where an unresolved hop does belong to the same AS

(§4.1), in order to model best practice route propagation. We de-
fine the reachability for 𝑜 as the subset of individual ASes in the
topology graph that receives a valid path, 𝑝, to 𝑜. More precisely,
reach(𝑜, 𝐺) = {𝑡 | 𝑝𝑡 ≠ ∅,∀𝑡 ∈ 𝐺}. We generally calculate reacha-
bility for the full, augmented AS-level topology graph 𝐼 (§4.1) or
for subgraphs where we exclude a set of nodes, for example 𝐼 \ 𝑇1
to restrict routes from propagating through the Tier-1 ISPs.
To assess the degree of the cloud providers’ independence and
potential to bypass the Internet hierarchy, we calculate reacha-
bility by propagating routes from an origin network, 𝑜, through
all networks except three sets of transit providers: the given ori-
gin’s transit providers (𝑃𝑜), Tier-1 ISPs (𝑇1), and Tier-2 ISPs (𝑇2). By
not propagating routes through the three sets of transit providers,
we use a subgraph of the full Internet topology. So, we define the
reachability determined using the resultant Internet subgraph as
hierarchy-free reachability: reach(𝑜, 𝐼 \ 𝑃𝑜 \ 𝑇1 \ 𝑇2). We examine
how bypassing each additional set affects reachability.
For example, consider calculating reachability from the cloud
provider’s perspective in the topology depicted in Fig. 1 for all three
sets of transit providers. The origin, which in this case is the cloud
provider, announces prefixes in each separate scenario. To calculate
provider-free reachability, announcements from the origin are not
allowed to propagate via its providers ( 1○, §6.2) which results in
a reachability of five ASes since the cloud can reach all peers and
their customers (all ovals except white). For Tier-1-free reachability,
we additionally do not propagate announcements via the Tier-1
ISPs ( 2○, §6.3) which reduces the cloud provider’s reachability to
four ASes, as ISP-A (in light gray) becomes unreachable. Finally, for
hierarchy-free reachability announcements are also not propagated
via Tier-2 ISPs ( 3○, §6.4) which reduces the cloud’s reachability to
two due to its p2p links with user ISPs 2 and 3 (in dark gray).
6.2 Bypassing Transit Providers
We first examine reachability when a given network bypasses its
transit providers, as identified in the CAIDA dataset. More specifi-
cally, we calculate reach(𝑜, 𝐼 \ 𝑃𝑜), which we refer to as provider-
free reachability. We exclude the given network’s transit providers
because one goal of increasing extensive interconnectivity is to re-
duce transit costs [26, 46, 68, 89]. The cloud providers aggressively
pursue interconnectivity, and we want to assess the independence
their connectivity affords them. Restricting origins to not use their
transit providers will not affect the Tier-1 ISPs’ reachability, since
they have no transit providers and instead mutually peer to achieve
global reachability. For the other networks, reachability while by-
passing their transit providers shows their reachability based on
the richness of their peering connections.
The results can be seen for each cloud, Tier-1, and Tier-2 in
Fig. 2. The Tier-1 ISPs have the maximum possible reachability
(69,488 ASes). Figure 2 also shows there are two non-Tier-1 ISPs
which have full reachability: PCCW (AS 3491), and Liberty Global
(AS 6830). PCCW and Liberty Global have no transit providers,
according to the CAIDA dataset, but they are not defined as Tier-1
ISPs in the dataset we use [120]. Google has nearly full reachability,
even though they have three transit providers in the September
2020 dataset [15]: Tata (AS 6453) and GTT (AS 3257) which are
Tier-1 ISPs, as well as Durand do Brasil (AS 22356). Even without
Figure 1: An example topology for calculating reachability. From
the cloud provider perspective, the topology depicts the types of
transit providers which are restricted for provider-free reachabil-
ity ( 1○, §6.2), Tier-1-free reachability ( 2○, §6.3), and hierarchy-free
reachability ( 3○, §6.4). The shaded availability depicts the final cal-
culation for which an AS is reachable (e.g., ISP A is reachable for
provider-free reachability, but not for Tier-1-free reachability.)
as the first resolved hop. As another example, Amazon uses early
exit for most tenant traffic, rather than routing tenant traffic across
their WAN, and so measurements from different Amazon locations
often use different routes to the same destination. So, issuing mea-
surements from more locations tends to decrease false negatives
(uncovers more peers) but also can increase false positives as errors
accumulate as more measurements are issued. Improving neighbor
identification, especially since the cloud providers have far more
PoPs than datacenters, is an open problem.
6 CLOUD PROVIDER INDEPENDENCE
In this section we describe our process for calculating the cloud
providers’ potential to bypass large transit providers. We examine
the cloud providers’ reachability while bypassing three sets of tran-
sit providers: their individual transit providers (§6.2), also the Tier-1
ISPs (§6.3), and additionally the Tier-2 ISPs (§6.4). We also examine
reachability for the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs while bypassing each
other in order to provide a means of gauging the cloud providers’
degree of independence and examine the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs
independence from one another. We calculate how reachability
has changed during the past five years (§6.5), how it compares to
customer cone (§6.6), and who the cloud providers are unable to
reach under our constraints (§6.7).
6.1 Quantifying Reachability
Here we discuss how we use the AS-level topology graph to calcu-
late the cloud providers’ potential to reach the rest of the Internet
while bypassing different sets of transit provider networks. We use
the topology graph (§4.1) and a BGP simulator to simulate route
propagation on the Internet while enforcing valley-free routing and
common routing policies: preferring customer over peer links and
preferring peer over provider links [37]. We allow all paths tied for
best to propagate, without breaking ties. Enforcing best practice
routing policies helps ensure that the emulated paths reflect paths
traffic is likely to actually take [5] (we show that our simulated
paths do follow paths seen in traceroutes in Appendix A).
We classify a given origin AS, 𝑜, as reachable by any individ-
ual AS, 𝑡, if the origin announces a prefix and 𝑡 receives the an-
nouncement. The route is propagated over the topology graph 𝐺

Figure 2: Reachability for the cloud providers, Tier-1, and Tier-2 ISPs, sorted by descending hierarchy-free reachability. The stacked bars repre-
sent reachability calculated using multiple subgraphs of the Internet topology: excluding per network transit providers (provider-free reach-
ability, §6.2, reach(𝒐, 𝑰 \ 𝑷𝒐) for cloud, Tier-1, and Tier-2), also bypassing Tier-1 ISPs (Tier-1-free reachability, §6.3, reach(𝒐, 𝑰 \ 𝑷𝒐 \ 𝑻1)
for cloud, Tier-1, and Tier-2), and also bypassing Tier-2 ISPs (hierarchy-free reachability, §6.4, reach(𝒐, 𝑰 \ 𝑷𝒐 \ 𝑻1 \ 𝑻2), cloud, Tier-1, and
Tier-2). Since the Tier-1 ISPs do not have providers, their reachability depicts the maximum possible (69,488 ASes). The cloud providers are
among the least affected by each reachability constraint, demonstrating their ability reach a large portion of the Internet while bypassing the
Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
the use of their transit providers, there are only 174 networks that
Google cannot reach when bypassing its transit providers.
The other cloud providers – Microsoft (64,475 ASes), IBM (63,927
ASes), and Amazon (62,831 ASes) – are able to reach a large por-
tion of networks when bypassing their individual transit providers.
Their calculated reachability is slightly lower than, but still compa-
rable to most of the Tier-2 ISPs (e.g., Hurricane Electric at 66,279
ASes). Amazon is affected the most by removing transit providers
since they have 20 according to CAIDA, but they are still able to
reach 90.0% of all ASes. This reinforces intuitions about the exten-
sive reach of the cloud providers’ peerings.
6.3 Bypassing the Tier-1 ISPs
Next we consider independence from the Tier-1 ISPs in addition
to transit providers, more specifically we calculate reach(𝑜, 𝐼 \
𝑃𝑜 \ 𝑇1). We refer to this calculation as Tier-1-free reachability. We
select the Tier-1 ISPs because they are considered to be the top of
the traditional Internet hierarchy [53], and one of the originally
identified goals of Internet flattening was to bypass the Tier-1
ISPs [39], so we want to analyze the cloud providers ability to
bypass them in particular. Even though the Tier-1 ISPs cooperate to
provide global reachability, they still compete for customers so we
want to examine their potential to bypass each other. The results
for each cloud, Tier-1, and Tier-2 can be seen in Fig. 2.
Since the Tier-1 ISPs all peer with each other, they all see a de-
crease in their reachability compared to bypassing only individual
transit providers, where they had reachability to the entire Internet.
Some Tier-1 ISPs see a much greater reduction than others. Level 3
(AS 3356) sees the lowest decrease in reachability of 4,929 ASes,
while Orange (AS 5511) sees the largest decrease of 14,334 ASes.
Overall, the varied decrease in calculated reachability shows that
some individual Tier-1 ISPs more aggressively pursue interconnec-
tivity outside of the Tier-1 ISPs than others and/or they have a
larger number of customers.
The Tier-2 ISPs see a slightly larger decrease in reachability than
the Tier-1 ISPs, but most have a reachability that is equivalent with
the Tier-1 ISPs, indicating they, too, have a high degree of inde-
pendence from the Tier-1 ISPs. Some of the Tier-2 ISPs see little
decrease in reachability when bypassing the Tier-1 ISPs relative to
when bypassing their providers. For example, KCOM’s providers
are all Tier-1 ISPs and KCOM has few peer relationships with any
Tier-1 ISP outside of their transit providers. As a result, they see
a greater reduction in reachability from provider-free reachability
than Tier-1-free reachability. Most Tier-2 ISPs do see a decrease,
with Hurricane Electric (AS 6939) only seeing a decrease of 4,805
ASes, while KDDI (AS 2516) sees a decrease in calculated reacha-
bility of 14,634 ASes. This shows that some of the Tier-2 ISPs are
more independent from the Tier-1 ISPs than others.
The cloud providers are amongst the least impacted. Google
(62,439 ASes) can still reach 89.9% of ASes; Amazon (57,096 ASes)
has the lowest calculated reachability of the four but is still able to
reach 82.2% of ASes while bypassing their transit providers and the
Tier-1 ISPs. Google’s calculated reachability decreased the most, by
6,875 ASes, while Microsoft had the lowest and only declined by
3,427 ASes. This difference is due to Google peering with 15 Tier-1
ISPs, while Microsoft counts 7 Tier-1 ISPs as transit providers.
6.4 Hierarchy-free Reachability
We consider bypassing the Tier-2 ISPs in addition to the Tier-1
ISPs and a given network’s transit providers. More specifically, we
calculate hierarchy-free reachability as reach(𝑜, 𝐼 \ 𝑃𝑜 \ 𝑇1 \ 𝑇2).
We include the Tier-2 ISPs because they are also large regional or

global transit providers, they are highly connected, and the cloud
providers use several as transit providers. For example, Hurricane
Electric is considered a Tier-2 ISP but is consistently in the top 10
networks based on customer cone size [15], and top two for transit
and node degrees [53]. The Tier-1 ISPs also rely on Tier-2 ISPs
as customers (§6.4 and Appendix B). The set of Tier-1 ISPs is not
universally agreed upon, so we select the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs as
defined in prior work [53].
Results for each cloud, Tier-1, and Tier-2 are in Fig. 2. We can
see that a handful of the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs saw less impact
to their calculated reachability than when bypassing only transit
providers or when bypassing transit providers plus Tier-1 ISPs.
For example, of the Tier-1 ISPs, Level 3 (AS 3356), Telia (AS 1299),
and Cogent (AS 174) had a greater reduction when bypassing other
Tier-1 ISPs. Level 3 once again had the lowest decrease in calculated
reachability at 3,405 ASes. There are a handful of Tier-1 ISPs whose
reachability incurs an enormous decrease when bypassing the Tier-
2 ISPs, indicating they rely heavily on those networks to reach
many destinations (we examine two examples in Appendix B).
Amongst the Tier-2 ISPs, Hurricane Electric (AS 6939 with 2,493
ASes) and Vocus (AS 4826 with 3,328 ASes) saw less reduction
in reachability than when bypassing the Tier-1 ISPs and transit
providers. This shows these networks have more potential to bypass
the Tier-2 ISPs than the Tier-1 ISPs.
Once again, the cloud providers were amongst the least impacted,
indicating they have a high degree of independence from the Tier-
2 ISPs also. Google’s decrease was the lowest at only 3,517 ASes,
while Amazon’s was the greatest at 5,735 ASes. Overall, the cloud
providers are amongst the least impacted by each change, demon-
strating that they have a high degree of freedom from each group of
transit provider networks. Similarly, Hurricane Electric and Level 3
show little impact to their reachability, highlighting their indepen-
dence from the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
Hierarchy-free reachability for Top 20 ASes. If we expand
our calculations for reachability and examine the top 20 ASes by
hierarchy-free reachability (Table 1, 2020 results on right side), six
of the networks are Tier-1 ISPs and two are Tier-2 ISPs, alongside
four other transit providers, whereas the top 20 for customer cone
are almost exclusively transit networks (not shown).
The rest of the top 20 networks by hierarchy-free reachability
are a mixture of major cloud providers and other cloud/content
providers. Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft occupy three of
the top five, and all four are in the top twenty positions, including
the third spot which is occupied by Google. This confirms our
initial hypothesis that the cloud providers have a high degree of
independence from the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. These results also
show there are a considerable number of networks with a high level
of independence from the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, although edge
networks are likely brought down due to lack of visibility [115].
6.5 Reachability over Time
We also want to examine to what degree the cloud providers’ in-
dependence has evolved in the five years since the scope of their
interconnectivity was identified in prior work [26]. We were pro-
vided access to the traceroute data from the prior work [26], which
allowed us to apply our methodology for calculating hierarchy-free
