When I attempted to use f2py with Intel Fortran, it seemed that distutils can
not find ifort in my computer, and raised the
numpy.distutils.fcompiler.CompilerNotFound.
The reason is that, Intel Compilers are set to print their version information
via standard error, not the stand output. So that these information cannot be
captured by subprocess.check_output in numpy/distutils/ccomplier.py.
It works now after adding 'stderr=subprocess.STDOUT' into check_output.
