results show that LEPs are much more memorable and se-
cure than passwords, they are less often reused, and they are
strong against friend guessing. While they take more time
to create and input during authentication, we believe their
beneﬁts may make them a viable primary authentication
mechanism for high-security servers, or a much better sec-
ondary authentication mechanism than security questions.
