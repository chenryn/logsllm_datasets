### Results

The findings indicate that LEPs (Login Experience Passphrases) are significantly more memorable and secure compared to traditional passwords. They are less frequently reused and exhibit strong resistance against friend-based guessing attacks. Although the creation and input of LEPs during authentication may require more time, their numerous benefits make them a promising primary authentication mechanism for high-security servers. Alternatively, they can serve as a more robust secondary authentication method compared to security questions.
