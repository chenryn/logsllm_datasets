# Built-in Policy Definitions for Azure Data Explorer

This page provides an index of [Azure Policy](/azure/governance/policy/overview) built-in policy definitions for Azure Data Explorer. For additional Azure Policy built-ins for other services, refer to [Azure Policy built-in definitions](/azure/governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies).

Each built-in policy definition is linked to its corresponding entry in the Azure portal. The **Version** column includes links to the source code on the [Azure Policy GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy).

## Azure Data Explorer Policies

| Name (Azure Portal) | Description | Effect(s) | Version (GitHub) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Azure Data Explorer encryption at rest should use a customer-managed key](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F81e74cea-30fd-40d5-802f-d72103c2aaaa) | Enabling encryption at rest with a customer-managed key on your Azure Data Explorer cluster provides enhanced control over the key used for encryption. This feature is particularly useful for customers with specific compliance requirements and requires a Key Vault to manage the keys. | Audit, Deny, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_CMK.json) |
| [Disk encryption should be enabled on Azure Data Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff4b53539-8df9-40e4-86c6-6b607703bd4e) | Enabling disk encryption helps protect and safeguard your data, ensuring it meets your organization's security and compliance commitments. | Audit, Deny, Disabled | [2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_disk_encrypted.json) |
| [Double encryption should be enabled on Azure Data Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fec068d99-e9c7-401f-8cef-5bdde4e6ccf1) | Enabling double encryption enhances data protection by encrypting data twice: once at the service level and once at the infrastructure level, using different encryption algorithms and keys. This helps meet organizational security and compliance requirements. | Audit, Deny, Disabled | [2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_doubleEncryption.json) |
| [Virtual network injection should be enabled for Azure Data Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9ad2fd1f-b25f-47a2-aa01-1a5a779e6413) | Secure your network perimeter by enabling virtual network injection, which allows you to enforce network security group rules, connect on-premises, and secure data connection sources with service endpoints. | Audit, Deny, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_VNET_configured.json) |
| [Azure Data Explorer should use a SKU that supports private link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F1fec9658-933f-4b3e-bc95-913ed22d012b) | Use supported SKUs to enable Azure Private Link, allowing you to connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address. This reduces data leakage risks by mapping private endpoints to applications. | Audit, Deny, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_PrivateEndpoint_NonPeSku_Deny.json) |
| [Public network access should be disabled on Azure Data Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F43bc7be6-5e69-4b0d-a2bb-e815557ca673) | Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring Azure Data Explorer can only be accessed from a private endpoint. This configuration prevents the creation of Azure Data Explorer clusters with public network access enabled. | Audit, Deny, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_PublicAccess_Deny.json) |
| [Configure Azure Data Explorer to disable public network access](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7b32f193-cb28-4e15-9a98-b9556db0bafa) | Disabling public network access ensures that Azure Data Explorer can only be accessed from a private endpoint, enhancing security. This configuration disables public network access for all Azure Data Explorer clusters. | Modify, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_DisablePublicAccess_Modify.json) |
| [Azure Data Explorer cluster should use a private link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff7735886-8927-431f-b201-c953922512b8) | Azure Private Link enables you to connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address, reducing data leakage risks by mapping private endpoints to your Azure Data Explorer cluster. | Audit, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_PrivateEndpoint_Audit.json) |
| [Configure Azure Data Explorer clusters with private endpoints](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fa47272e1-1d5d-4b0b-b366-4873f1432fe0) | Connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address by configuring private endpoints. This reduces data leakage risks by mapping private endpoints to Azure Data Explorer. | DeployIfNotExists, Disabled | [1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Azure%20Data%20Explorer/ADX_PrivateEndpoint_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
