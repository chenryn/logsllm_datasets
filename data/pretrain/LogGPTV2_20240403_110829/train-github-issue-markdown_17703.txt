**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
Adding NamedModulesPlugin to a project that uses certain global lookups
results in what are effectively reference errors.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
Add NamedModulePlugins to https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-
loader/blob/master/examples/basic/webpack.dev.config.js (which uses jquery &
bootstrap. Resulting Error).
https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-
ui/blob/master/src/components/Icon/index.js#L65 also breaks with `keys` being
declared not a function.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
That global lookups work.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**  
Compatibility with other libraries.
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**
