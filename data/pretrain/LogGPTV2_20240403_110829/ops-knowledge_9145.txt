User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 database_wait_event 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks if there is a wait event in the database. If there is a wait event, it retrieves the wait status and wait event information and stores it in the detail dictionary. If the detail dictionary already has wait event information, it suggests that there is no root cause for the issue. Otherwise, it suggests that the wait event may be a root cause for the issue. If there is no wait event information, it suggests that there is no root cause for the issue. Therefore, the presence of wait event information is a root cause for the issue, while the absence of wait event information is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- wait_event_info
- wait_status
- wait_event
- detail
- suggestion
