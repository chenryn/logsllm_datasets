Question: You have been tasked with designing a public ledger using a hash chain to ensure that it is append-only and immutable. You receive a new message, \(m_6\), to append to the ledger. What information will you include in Block 6 to maintain the integrity of the hash chain, and why is this crucial for the ledger's security?
"A": "Include \(m_6\) and the hash of Block 5 in Block 6, ensuring any alteration of previous blocks would invalidate the hash of subsequent blocks.",
"B": "Include only \(m_6\) in Block 6 as including the hash of the previous block is redundant and increases data size unnecessarily.",
"C": "Include \(m_6\) and a random nonce in Block 6, relying on the uniqueness of the nonce for security.",
"D": "Include \(m_6\) and the hashes of all previous blocks in Block 6, to doubly ensure that no prior information is altered."
Answer: A
