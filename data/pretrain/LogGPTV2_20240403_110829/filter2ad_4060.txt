ABSTRACT 
As the evolution of technology accelerates toward the “Everything 
Connected” model, the demands placed on cyber security  will be 
the principle concern of users when considering adoption. 
In  this  new  era  the  logical  point  of  protection  will  be  the 
communications infrastructure that forms the connected web.   As 
such, Cisco Systems is funding research and driving innovation in 
network  based  cyber  security.  The  initial  thrust  of  this  effort  is 
focused  on  cryptography,  data  analytics  and  privacy,  platform 
protection and threat awareness. 
This  discussion  will  focus  on  what  Cisco  is  presently  doing  in 
Advanced  Security  Research.  The  current  global  engagements, 
future needs and likely methodologies.
