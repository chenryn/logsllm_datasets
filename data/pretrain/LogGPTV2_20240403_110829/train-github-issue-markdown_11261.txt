I am trying to print from my app. When I run window.print() it opens the print
menu. Once I click OK it adds it to the queue and it is immediately removed
from the queue and prints nothing. When I check the queue Pages is N/A and
Size has no information. I found the post about using webContent.print() which
requires the pdf.dll but I can't seem to find that in my files or in the
electron repository.
