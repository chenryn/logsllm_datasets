keep A in the dark about B’s disablement. However, as discussed
in Section 3.1, in Dhwani’s security model, a deliberate attack by
E to disable B is not within scope. However, if B were to fail ac-
cidentally (e.g., lose power), A would detect that the jamming has
ceased and stop transmitting immediately, as noted in Section 7.
Directional reception and shielding attacks. In these attacks, E
In this section, we present an evaluation of Dhwani and quantify
several performance aspects such as its range, efﬁcacy of self inter-
ference cancellation, and achieved packet success rates for different
modulation schemes.
9.1 Operating Range of Dhwani
For Dhwani to be suitable for NFC, the ability to communicate
must be limited to a very small range. As discussed in Section 3,
each transmitter was pre-conﬁgured based on measurements to be
limited to a range of 10cm.
In these experiments, we evaluate
how sharply the drop off in the communication range of Dhwani
is. To answer this, we measured the Packet Success Rate (PSR) for
Dhwani by transmitting 100 packets between a Samsung Galaxy
S2 and a HP mini, at each of several different distances separating
the devices. Figure 13 shows the PSR as a function of distance,
with and without jamming, for two different modulations BPSK
and QPSK. The best case SIC was used in the case with jamming
(see Section 9.2 below). As seen from Figure 13, the PSR sharply
falls to 0 at a distance of about 20cm, even in the absence of any
jamming. So the communication range is indeed small.

In this experiment we evaluate the effectiveness of Dhwani’s
SIC. As described in Section 6, Dhwani generates PN sequences
during training and uses the recorded versions of these sequences
to perform SIC. If the devices are trained at one “training” loca-
tion and then taken to another “test” location, while the channel
characteristics of the speaker and microphone do not change, the
multi-path environment may change. To evaluate the impact of
this change, we tested Dhwani in four different locations – a small
room, a large room, an open pantry area and a cafeteria, which we
shall refer to as L1, L2, L3, and L4, respectively. At each of the
locations, Dhwani was trained by generating a library of PN se-
quences, and then tested by performing SIC at all other locations.
In Table 1 the value of ith row and jth column is the amount
of SIC obtained when the PN sequence was generated at Li was
used to cancel at location Lj, the results being averaged over 10
trials. As seen from Table 1, the cancellation is close to 20dB (i.e.,
100 of the jamming signal remains) whenever the testing and
only 1
training locations are the same. This is what we expect to be the
case when the receiver is a ﬁxed installation, such as a POS termi-
nal. Further, unsurprisingly, when the training and test locations are
non-matching, the effectiveness of SIC degenerates to 6-7dB. This
quick degeneration of SIC performance with even a limited amount
of multipath shows drop from 20 to 6-7 indicates that even though
multi-path is not the signiﬁcant reason for frequency selectivity of
the acoustic channel it does have signiﬁcant impact on SIC. How-
ever, per the discussion in Section 3.5, even this reduced amount of
SIC is sufﬁcient for secure communication.
9.3 Impact of Jamming on Packet Success Rate
To evaluate the impact of jamming, we measured packet suc-
cess rates for 256-bit packets at various locations with SIC based
on the recorded PN sequences from various locations. Figure 14
depicts the packet success rates when the initial conﬁguration was
performed at L1 and Dhwani was tested at locations L1-L3. The
packet success rate is measured by transmitting 100 packets and
counting the number of packets whose CRC did not fail. In order
to establish a baseline, we ﬁrst measured the PSR without any jam-
ming, which is referred to as the Baseline in Figure 14. As seen
from the ﬁgure, in the absence of jamming, for BPSK modulation,
the packet success rate is 100% while it is about 95% for QPSK
modulation.
In the presence of jamming and SIC with the con-
ﬁguration and testing locations both being L1, BPSK still gives a
100% packet success rate while it reduces to about 80% for QPSK.
When Dhwani is tested at other locations, the PSR is around 90%
for BPSK and 60-70% for QPSK. Note that in the event of a packet
loss, retransmissions can be used to recover the packet. However,
our current implementation does not have any retransmissions. A
key result in all these experiments was that in the presence of jam-
ming, zero out of 100 packets were received successfully at each of
the locations when we did not apply any SIC (as would be the situ-
ation of the eavesdropper). This corresponds to the scenario where
the eavesdropper is exactly co-located at the receiver.
9.4 Performance of JamSecure with increas-
ing Mixing Factor
In the previous results we demonstrated the effectiveness of SIC
when jamming was done using a single PN sequence Mixing Fac-
tor K = 1 in Eqn 6. As discussed in Section 6, when receivers
are located at ﬁxed installations, an eavesdropper may have the ad-
vantage of time to learn the library of PN sequences. The mixing
factor K > 1 can then be used to thwart the eavesdropper from
learning the library since the eavesdropper’s search space increases
exponentially as K. Clearly as K is increased, the performance of
SIC is expected to degrade. This is because, the estimation errors
of each of the constituent PN sequences add up and result in larger
errors.
Figure 15 depicts the SIC achieved by JamSecure for various
values of K — when the training and testing locations were the
same (L1) and when the training and testing locations were differ-
ent (trained in L1 and tested in L2,L3). As seen from Figure 15,
when the training and testing locations are the same, as expected
SIC does degenerate as K as it increases from 1 to 5, however,
even at K = 5 the SIC is as high as 10dB. When training and
testing locations are different (L1-L2 and L1-L3) the achieved SIC
only decreases slightly as K increased from 1 to 5 and is typically
between (6-7dB). Figure 16 depicts the Packet Success Rate (PSR)
corresponding to the scenarios in Figure 15 for BPSK modulation.
As depicted in Figure 16 the PSR is almost 100% when the receiver
is trained and tested in the same location and over 90% for values
of K between 1 and 5.
9.5 Multipath Effects on Jamming
To answer the question of whether there are special vantage points
where jamming is not very effective and so the eavesdropper could
enjoy a high SNR, we conducted experiments using the topology
depicted in Figure 18. We placed an eavesdropper E at various lo-
cations around the sender A, and measured the received SNR in
the presence of jamming from the receiver B. Figure 17 shows the
received SNR at placement locations centred around the sender at
three different distances D = 2,5 and 10cm and θ at 45o inter-
vals. As seen in Figure 17, at all these locations, while there are
variations in SNR, the observed SNR is typically less than 0dB, in-
dicating that there is no vantage point where an eavesdropper may
be placed to achieve successful reception.
10. RELATED WORK
We have presented background and related work in the context
of NFC (Section 2) and SIC (Section 6.1). We now discuss prior
work on phone based acoustic communication and physical-layer
security.
10.1 Acoustic Communication
[17] provides an extensive review of acoustic communication
as a wireless technology for short and long distance communica-
tion. Existing techniques use On Off Keying (OOK) modulation
and achieve up to 270bps at short distance of under 30cm. Our cur-
rent implementation of Dhwani uses OFDM and achieves 5x these
data rates.
Wimbeep [1] and Zoosh [2] offer acoustic communication sys-
tems targeting location-based advertising and mobile payments. While
the technical details of these start-up offerings are not available, the
description of Zoosh at [8] indicates that it operates in the ultrasonic
band (beyond 20 KHz), offers a low bit rate of 300 bps (presumably
because of the poor speaker and microphone characteristics beyond
20 KHz), and limits the communication range to 15cm to provide
security. We believe that security based on range-limitation alone is
inherently risky since the eavesdropper could use an ultra-sensitive
microphone to boost the effective reception range. Hence Dhwani’s
emphasis on information-theoretic security at the physical layer.
10.2 Physical-Layer Security
The related work closest to Dhwani is IMDShield [12], which
aims to secure communication to and from implantable medical
devices (IMDs).
IMDs are not amenable to using cryptographic
73Figure 16: Packet Success Rate With Increasing

techniques due to limited device memory and the need for im-
mediate access in critical scenarios. IMDShield is a base-station
that attempts to provide secure communication to and from the
IMDs without requiring any alteration to the devices themselves.
IMDShield continuously listens to IMD transmissions and trans-
mits a jamming signal to secure it from eavesdroppers. Similar to
Dhwani, the IMD base-station can perform self-interference can-
cellation and extract the message transmitted from the IMD. It then
relays this message securely to the intended receiver using suitable
encryption mechanisms. Similarly, in order to disallow malicious
devices from reprogramming the IMD, the IMDSheild upon detect-
ing a spurious transmission actively jams it and prevents the IMD
from being programmed. Dhwani’s novelty compared this work
lies in (a) it being a software-only solution with no additional hard-
ware, and (b) the JamSecure technique, which uses a pre-computed
library based approach to jamming and SIC (Sec 6.2).
In Radio Telepathy [19], the authors propose a scheme where
every pair of nodes can agree on a cryptographic key without ac-
tually performing a key exchange. The key idea is that since the
wireless channel between a pair of nodes is symmetric, a common
key can be extracted independently at each node from the channel
response characteristics from a single transmission.
In [15], the
authors explore the practical limitations of extracting viable cryp-
tographic keys using channel response information. In [18] the au-
thors propose attack cancellation – a technique where sensor nodes
in a sensor network collaboratively jam fake transmissions to de-
fend against battery depletion attacks.
11. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented Dhwani, a software-only acous-
tic NFC system that is accessible to the large base of existing mo-
bile devices. The design of Dhwani is informed by our character-
ization of acoustic hardware and environment, and includes sev-
eral novel elements. Chief among these is the receiver-based, self-
jamming technique called JamSecure, which provides information-
theoretic, physical-layer security. Our experimental evaluation point
to the suitability of Dhwani for secure NFC communication.
