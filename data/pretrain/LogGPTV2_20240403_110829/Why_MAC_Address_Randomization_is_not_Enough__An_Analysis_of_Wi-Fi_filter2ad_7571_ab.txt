Throughout our study, we used several datasets to pin-
point identifying elements contained in Wi-Fi frames and
to evaluate the performances of our tracking attacks. The
following datasets were used: the Train-station dataset
captured around one large train station in Lyon in Octo-
ber 2015; the Lab dataset, a 5-day-long capture in Octo-
ber 2015 in our laboratory; and the Sapienza probe request
dataset [4] that has been captured by Barbera et al. in 2013.
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of those datasets.

we restricted the capture to probe requests only, which means
that no network data was collected. In addition, we applied
to our datasets the same anomyzation method as used by
Barbera et al. on the Sapienza dataset: once collected, all
identiﬁers (MAC addresses and SSIDs) were replaced by a
pseudonym, preventing any re-identiﬁcation.
In all datasets we removed probe requests sent from lo-
cally administered addresses. These are either random MAC
addresses, or specially assigned ones, and in general do not
remain constant. Since we use MAC addresses as unique de-
vices identiﬁers to check the performance of our algorithms,
they would distort our results. Finally, based on sequence
numbers and device-speciﬁc IEs, we detected and removed
one device that kept the ﬁrst three bytes of its MAC address,
but randomized the last three.
3. PROBE REQUEST FINGERPRINTING
Information Element Fingerprint
In this section, we study how much identifying informa-
tion can be found in probe requests besides MAC addresses,
timing, and sequence numbers. In particular, we study the
data carried in the frame body of probe requests, and show
that it can be used to ﬁngerprint and identify devices.
3.1
Probe requests include data in their frame body under the
form of Information Elements (IEs) [31, §7.2.3], also called
tagged parameters, or tags. These IEs are not mandatory
and are used to advertise the support of various functionali-
ties. They are generally composed of several subﬁelds whose
size can range from one bit to several bytes. We identify 12
useful elements, presented in Table 2. This list is not ex-
haustive and could be extended. Selected IEs include items
related to Supported Rates, High Throughput capabili-
ties and Interworking Capabilities. Because they are
optional, those IEs are not included by all devices and the
set of IEs can therefore vary from one device to another, de-
pending on the conﬁguration and capabilities of the device.
While the 802.11 standard states that IEs must be sorted
in ascending order based on their tag [31, §8.4.2.1], several
devices ignore this and use a custom order. Therefore the
order of IEs is also potential source of information.

3.1.1 Entropy
We evaluate the quantity of information brought by these
diﬀerent elements using the three datasets introduced in Sec-
tion 2.4. Following the approach of Panopticlick [16], we
empirically evaluate the amount of information provided by
each element by computing its entropy in the datasets. The
entropy of an element i is computed as follows:
fi,j ∗ log fi,j
(2)
Hi = −(cid:88)
j∈Ei
where Ei is the domain of possible values for element i and
fi,j is the frequency (i.e., probability) of the value j for the
element i in the dataset. We consider the absence of an
element as a possible value.
Results of our analysis of the IEs are presented in Table 2.
The Entropy column presents the amount of identifying bits
provided by the elements. The Stability column presents
the fraction of devices for which the value of the element
is constant throughout the datasets. Finally, the Aﬀected
Devices column presents the fraction of devices that include
this IE in their probe requests.
What appears in this table is that all of these elements are
stable for most devices over the observation period. Since
most of these IEs reﬂect intrinsic capabilities of the device,
there is no reason for them to change over time. Upon fur-
ther inspection, it appears that elements which are not sta-
ble over time are generated by a small group of device. Most
of the studied IEs are present in almost all devices. For
instance, the HT capabilities tag, used to advertise capa-
bilities for the High-Throughput 802.11n standard, is the
most useful one for ﬁngerprinting. This tag includes a lot
of subﬁelds whose values vary from one device to another,
providing a lot of identifying information.
There is a high diversity in the amount of information pro-
vided by the selected elements. For instance, the HT capa-
bilities info provides up to 4.74 bits of entropy, while the
HT Antenna Selection Capabilities provides only 0.711
bit in the best case. This diﬀerence can be explained by a
larger element (in term of bits), and also by a variance of
the value of this element.
Some diﬀerences between the datasets are likely due to
their age. In particular, some features were not yet wide-
spread when the Sapienza dataset was produced in 2013.
Back then, few devices had an Extended Capabilities IE,
while now it is wide-spread. Apart from this, the three
datasets display the same trends for all the elements.
The Overall row presents the information for all the IEs
considered together. We can observe that for 88.8% to 93.8%
of devices, the included IEs as well as their values do not
change over time. More importantly, the amount of infor-
mation brought by all the IEs together is above 5.4 bits in
all three datasets.
Note that the WPS element is not stable for all devices.
This does not mean that its content varies over time, but
that it is intermittently included by some devices, since we
consider the lack of an element as a possible value. When
the WPS element is present, it always has the same content.
3.1.2 Anonymity sets
To further study the impact of those IEs, we evaluate
the usefulness of the IEs as a device identiﬁer. For each
IE ﬁngerprint, we form a set of all the devices sharing this
ﬁngerprint (called an anonymity set) and compute the size
of this set. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the set sizes.
The three datasets exhibit a similar distribution. First, we
can observe that there is a signiﬁcant number of devices
alone in their set (leftmost impulse), which means that they
have a unique ﬁngerprint. Then, there is a large number of
small groups, meaning that although those devices cannot
be uniquely identiﬁed by the IE ﬁngerprint, they are in a
small anonymity set. Finally, there is a small number of
large sets, meaning that a large number of devices share the
same ﬁngerprint.
This last case is likely caused by highly popular device
models: they are found in large numbers and share the same
characteristics. A corollary of this observation is that the
identifying potential of IEs is reduced for such device models.
Those results show that the IEs can serve as a unique iden-
tiﬁer for some devices and that, for the rest of the devices,
it can be used as a ﬁrst step toward full identiﬁcation.

3.2 Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
One of the IEs found in probe requests is dedicated to
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), a protocol simplifying device
pairing. We show that the unique identiﬁer contained in this
IE can be used to reveal the real MAC address of the device.
Some devices add a WPS IE to their broadcast probe re-
quests to advertise their support of the protocol (see Ta-
ble 3). In our datasets, between 3.7% and 8.6% of devices
broadcast at least one probe request with such an IE. One
notable ﬁeld of this IE is the Universally Unique Identiﬁer
