User: I have Python application and virtualenv for it. I run it on Debian virtual machine. Is it possible to configure IntelliJ to start application and use IntelliJ debug tools? The problem is how to use virtualenv for debian in Windows 7 system.
Assistant: I solved it. If connect with my virtual machine by remote debug tool. I add one line with IntellJ/PyCharm generate to entry point of paster script. Before debug i run script (using IntelliJ remote tool) with run application on virtual machine.
