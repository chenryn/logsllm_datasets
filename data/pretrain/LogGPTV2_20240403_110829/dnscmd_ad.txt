Remarks
To display server-level registry settings, use the /info command.
To see a list of settings that you can display with this command, see the /config command.

dnscmd /zonepause command
Pauses the specified zone, which then ignores query requests.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zonepause 
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the name of the zone to be paused.
Remarks
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zonepause test.contoso.com
dnscmd /zoneprint command
Lists the records in a zone.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zoneprint 
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the name of the zone to be listed.
dnscmd /zonerefresh command
Forces a secondary DNS zone to update from the master zone.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zonerefresh 
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the name of the zone to be refreshed.
Remarks
The zonerefresh command forces a check of the version number in the primary server s start of authority (SOA) resource record. If the version number on the primary server is higher than the secondary server's version number, a zone transfer is initiated that updates the secondary server. If the version number is the same, no zone transfer occurs.
The forced check occurs by default every 15 minutes. To change the default, use the dnscmd config refreshinterval command.
dnscmd config refreshinterval
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zonerefresh test.contoso.com
dnscmd /zonereload command
Copies zone information from its source.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zonereload 
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the name of the zone to be reloaded.
Remarks
If the zone is active directory integrated, it reloads from Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
If the zone is a standard file-backed zone, it reloads from a file.
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zonereload test.contoso.com
dnscmd /zoneresetmasters command
Resets the IP addresses of the primary server that provides zone transfer information to a secondary zone.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zoneresetmasters  [/local] [ []...]
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the name of the zone to be reset.
/local
Sets a local master list. This parameter is used for active directory integrated zones.
The IP addresses of the primary servers of the secondary zone.
Remarks
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zoneresetmasters test.contoso.com 10.0.0.1
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zoneresetmasters test.contoso.com /local
dnscmd /zoneresetscavengeservers command
Changes the IP addresses of the servers that can scavenge the specified zone.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zoneresetscavengeservers  [/local] [ []...]
Parameters
Parameters
Description
Specifies the DNS server to manage, represented by IP address, FQDN, or host name. If this parameter is omitted, the local server is used.
Specifies the zone to scavenge.
/local
Sets a local master list. This parameter is used for active directory integrated zones.
Lists the IP addresses of the servers that can perform the scavenge. If this parameter is omitted, all servers that host this zone can scavenge it.
Remarks
By default, all servers that host a zone can scavenge that zone.
If a zone is hosted on more than one DNS server, you can use this command to reduce the number of times a zone is scavenged.
Scavenging must be enabled on the DNS server and zone that is affected by this command.
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zoneresetscavengeservers test.contoso.com 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2
dnscmd /zoneresetsecondaries command
Specifies a list of IP addresses of secondary servers to which a primary server responds when it is asked for a zone transfer.
Syntax
dnscmd [] /zoneresetsecondaries  {/noxfr | /nonsecure | /securens | /securelist } {/nonotify | /notify | /notifylist }
Parameters
Parameters

/local
Sets a local master list. This parameter is used for active directory integrated zones.
/noxfr
Specifies that no zone transfers are allowed.
/nonsecure
Specifies that all zone transfer requests are granted.
/securens
Specifies that only the server that is listed in the name server (NS) resource record for the zone is granted a transfer.
/securelist
Specifies that zone transfers are granted only to the list of servers. This parameter must be followed by an IP address or addresses that the primary server uses.
Lists the IP addresses that receive zone transfers from the primary server. This parameter is used only with the /securelist parameter.
/nonotify
Specifies that no change notifications are sent to secondary servers.
/notify
Specifies that change notifications are sent to all secondary servers.
/notifylist
Specifies that change notifications are sent to only the list of servers. This command must be followed by an IP address or addresses that the primary server uses.
Specifies the IP address or addresses of the secondary server or servers to which change notifications are sent. This list is used only with the /notifylist parameter.
Remarks
Examples
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zoneresetsecondaries test.contoso.com /noxfr /nonotify
dnscmd dnssvr1.contoso.com /zoneresetsecondaries test.contoso.com /securelist 11.0.0.2
