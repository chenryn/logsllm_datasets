half the password to the key.
 Key rotation. If you use the same keys forever, you are at risk of having the keys lost or stolen or having
your information decrypted. To mitigate these risks, you should retire old keys and implement new ones.
 Key destruction. A key can be put in a state of suspension (temporary hold), revocation (revoked with no
reinstatement possible), expiration (expired until renewed), or destruction (such as at the end of a lifecycle
or after a compromise).
 Key escrow and key backup recovery. What happens if you encrypt data on your laptop but then lose
your private key (for example, through profile corruption)? Normally, you lose the data. But key escrow
enables storage of a key for later recovery. This is useful if a private key is lost or a court case requires
escrow pending the outcome of a trial. You also need to have a method to back up and recover keys. Many
PKIs offer a backup or recovery method, and you should take advantage of that if requirements call for it.
 Digital signatures. Digital signatures are the primary method for providing non-repudiation. By digitally signing a
document or email, you are providing proof that you are the sender. Digital signatures are often combined with
data encryption to provide confidentiality.
 Non-repudiation. For this section, non-repudiation refers to methods to ensure that the origin of data is can be
deduced with certainty. The most common method for asserting the source of data is to use digital signatures,
which rely on certificates. If User1 sends a signed email to User2, User2 can be sure that the email came from
User1. It isn’t foolproof though. For example, if User1 shares his credentials to his computer with User3, then User3
can send an email to User2 purporting to be User1, and User2 wouldn’t have a way to deduce that. It is common
to combine non-repudiation with confidentiality (data encryption).
38
 Integrity. A hash function implements encryption with a specified algorithm but without a key. It is a one-way
function. Unlikely encryption, where you can decrypt what’s been encrypted, hashing isn’t meant to be decrypted
in the same way. For example, if you hash the word “hello”, you might end up with
“4cd21dba5fb0a60e26e83f2ac1b9e29f1b161e4c1fa7425e73048362938b4814”. When apps are available for
download, the install files are often hashed. The hash is provided as part of the download. If the file changes, the
hash changes. That way, you can figure out if you have the original install file or a bad or modified file. Hashes are
also used for storing passwords, with email and for other purposes. Hashes are susceptible to brute force. If you
try to hash every possible word and phrase, eventually you will get the hash value that matches whatever hash you
are trying to break. Salting provides extra protection for hashing by adding an extra, usually random, value to the
source. Then, the hashing process hashes the original value of the source plus the salt value. For example, if your
original source value is “Hello” and your salt value is “12-25-17-07:02:32”, then “hello12-25-17-07:02:32” gets
hashed. Salting greatly increased the strength of hashing.
 Methods of cryptanalytic attacks. There are several methods to attack cryptography. Each has strengths and
weaknesses. The primary methods are:
 Brute force. In a brute-force attack, every possible combination is attempted. Eventually, with enough time,
the attack will be successful. For example, imagine a game where you have to guess the number between
1 and 1,000 that I chose. A brute-force attack would try all numbers between 1 and 1,000 until it found my
number. This is a very simplified version of a brute-force attack, but the key point is that a brute-force attack
will eventually be successful, provided it is using the correct key space. For example, if an attempt is made
to brute force a password, the key space must include all the characters in the password; if the key space
includes only letters but the password includes a number, the attack will fail.
 Ciphertext only. In a ciphertext-only attack, you obtain samples of ciphertext (but not any plaintext). If you
have enough ciphertext samples, the idea is that you can decrypt the target ciphertext based on the
ciphertext samples. Today, such attacks are very difficult.
 Known plaintext. In a known plaintext attack, you have an existing plaintext file and the matching
ciphertext. The goal is to derive the key. If you derive the key, you can use it to decrypt other ciphertext
created by the same key.
 Digital rights management. When people think of digital rights management (DRM), they think of protections
placed on movies and games. But for the CISSP exam, it is really about protection of data, such as spreadsheets
and email messages. Organizations often refer to data protection as enterprise digital rights management (E-DRM)
or information rights management (IRM). Several vendors offer solutions to protect data in individual files. The
solutions all provide a common set of foundational features:
 Restrict viewing of a document to a defined set of people
 Restrict editing of a document to a defined set of people
 Expire a document (rendering it unreadable after a specified date)
 Restrict printing of a document to a defined set of people
 Provide portable document protection such that the protection remains with the document no matter
where it is stored, how it is stored, or which computing device or user opens it
39
You can use DRM, E-DRM or IRM to protect data for your organization. Many of the solutions also enable you to
securely share data with external organizations. Sometimes, this sharing is enabled through federation. Other
times, the use of a public cloud provider enables cross-organization sharing. DRM, E-DRM and IRM provide
companies with a way to provide confidentiality to sensitive documents. Additionally, some of the solutions enable
you to track when and where documents were viewed. Last, some solutions enable you to update the protection
of a document (such as removing a previously authorized viewer) even after a document has been sent and shared
with external parties.
3.10 Apply security principles to site and facility design
This section applies to applying secure principles to data centers, server rooms, network operations centers and offices
across an organization’s locations. While some areas must be more secure than others, you must apply secure principles
throughout your site to maximize security and reduce risk. Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a
well known set of guidelines for the secure design of buildings and office spaces. CPTED stresses three principles:
 Natural surveillance. Natural surveillance enables people to observe what’s going on around the building or
campus while going about their day-to-day work. It also eliminates hidden areas, areas of darkness and obstacles
such as solid fences. Instead, it stresses low or see-through fencing, extra lighting, and the proper place of doors,
windows and walkways to maximize visibility and deter crime.
 Territoriality. Territoriality is the sectioning of areas based on the area’s use. For example, you might have a
private area in the basement of your building for long-term company storage. It should be clearly designated as
private, with signs, different flooring and other visible artifacts. The company’s parking garage should have signs
indicating that it is private parking only. People should recognize changes in the design of the space and be aware
that they might be moving into a private area.
 Access control. Access control is the implementation of impediments to ensure that only authorized people can
gain access to a restricted area. For example, you can put a gate at the driveway to the parking lot. For an unmanned
server room, you should have a secure door with electronic locks, a security camera and signs indicating that the
room is off limits to unauthorized people.
The overall goal is to deter unauthorized people from gaining access to a location (or a secure portion of a location), prevent
unauthorized people from hiding inside or outside of a location, and prevent unauthorized people from committing attacks
against the facility or personnel. There are several smaller activities tied to site and facility design, such as upkeep and
maintenance. If your property is run down, unkempt or appears to be in disrepair, it gives attackers the impression that
they can do whatever they want on your property.
3.11 Implement site and facility security controls
Physical security is a topic that covers all the interior and exterior of company facilities. While the subtopics are focused on
the interior, many of the same common techniques are applicable to the exterior too.
 Wiring closets. A wiring closet is typically a small room that holds IT hardware. It is common to find telephony and
network devices in a wiring closet. Occasionally, you also have a small number of servers in a wiring closet. Access
40
to the wiring closest should be restricted to the people responsible for managing the IT hardware. You should use
some type of access control for the door, such as an electronic badge system or electronic combination lock. From
a layout perspective, wiring closets should be accessible only in private areas of the building interior; people must
pass through a visitor center and a controlled doorway prior to be able to enter a wiring closet.
 Server rooms and data centers. A server room is a bigger version of a wiring closet but not nearly as big as a data
center. A server room typically houses telephony equipment, network equipment, backup infrastructure and
servers. A server room should have the same minimum requirements as a wiring closet. While the room is bigger,
it should have only one entry door; if there is a second door, it should be an emergency exit door only. It is common
to use door alarms for server rooms: If the door is propped open for more than 30 seconds, the alarm goes off. All
attempts to enter the server room without authorization should be logged. After multiple failed attempts, an alert
should be generated.
Data centers are protected like server rooms, but often with a bit more protection. For example, in some data
centers, you might need to use your badge both to enter and to leave, whereas with a server room, it is common
to be able to walk out by just opening the door. In a data center, it is common to have one security guard checking
visitors in and another guard walking the interior or exterior. Some organizations set time limits for authorized
people to remain inside the data center. Inside a data center, you should lock everything possible, such as storage
cabinets and IT equipment racks.
 Media storage facilities. Media storage facilities often store backup tapes and other media, so they should be
protected just like a server room. It is common to have video surveillance too.
 Evidence storage. An evidence storage room should be protected like a server room or media storage facility.
 Restricted work area. Restricted work areas are used for sensitive operations, such as network operations or
security operations. The work area can also be non-IT related, such as a bank vault. Protection should be like a
server room, although video surveillance is typically limited to entry and exit points.
 Utilities and HVAC. When it comes to utilities such as HVAC, you need to think through the physical controls. For
example, a person should not be able to crawl through the vents or ducts to reach a restricted area. For the health
of your IT equipment, you should use separate HVAC systems. All utilities should be redundant. While a building
full of cubicles might not require a backup HVAC system, a data center does, to prevent IT equipment from
overheating and failing. In a high-security environment, the data center should be on a different electrical system
than other parts of the building. It is common to use a backup generator just for the data center, whereas the main
cubicle and office areas have only emergency lighting.
 Environmental issues. Some buildings use water-based sprinklers for fire suppression. In a fire, shut down the
electricity before turning on the water sprinklers (this can be automated). Water damage is possible; by having
individual sprinklers turn on, you can minimize the water damage to only what is required to put out a fire. Other
water issues include flood, a burst pipe or backed up drains. Besides water issues, there are other environmental
issues that can create trouble, such as earthquakes, power outages, tornados and wind. These issues should be
considered before deciding on a data center site or a backup site. It is a good practice to have your secondary data
center far enough away from your primary data center so it is not at risk from any environmental issues affecting
the primary data center. For example, you should avoid building your backup data center on the same earthquake
fault line as your primary data center, even if they are hundreds of miles away from each other.
41
 Fire prevention, detection and suppression. The following key points highlight things to know for this section:
 Fire prevention. To prevent fires, you need to deploy the proper equipment, test it and manage it. This
includes fire detectors and fire extinguishers. You also need to ensure that workers are trained about what
to do if they see a fire and how to properly store combustible material. From a physical perspective, you
can use firewalls and fire suppressing doors to slow the advancement of a fire and compartmentalize it.
 Fire detection. The goal is to detect a fire as soon as possible. For example, use smoke detectors, fire
detectors and other sensors (such as heat sensors).
 Fire suppression. You need a way to suppress a fire once a fire breaks out. Having emergency pull levers
for employees to pull down if they see a fire can help expedite the suppression response (for example, by
automatically calling the fire department when the lever is pulled). You can use water-based firesuppression system, or minimize the chances of destroying IT equipment by choosing non-water fire
suppressants, such as foams, powders CO2-based solutions, or an FM-200 system. FM-200 systems replace
Halon, which was banned for depleting the ozone layer. FM-200 is more expensive than water sprinklers.
