User: I have a huge directory that keeps getting updated all the time. I am trying to list only the latest 100 files in the directory using python. I tried using os.listdir(), but when the size of directory approaches 1,00,000 files, it seems as though listdir() crashes( or i have not waited long enough). I only need the first 100 files (or filenames) for further processing, so i dont want listdir() to be filled with all the 100000 files. Is there a good way of doing this in Python?
PS: I am very new to programming
Assistant: You may try to read a directory directly (as a file) and pick data from there. How successfull would this be is a question of a filesystem you are on. Try first ls or dir commands to see who returns faster. os.listdir() or that funny little program. You'll se that both are in trouble. Here the key is just in that that your directory is flooded with new files. That creates kind of bottle neck.
