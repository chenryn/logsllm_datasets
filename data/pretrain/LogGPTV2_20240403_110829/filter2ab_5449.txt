### Title: Black Hat US-20: HTTP Request Smuggling in 2020 â€“ New Variants, New Defenses, and New Challenges

**Abstract:**

HTTP Request Smuggling, also known as HTTP Desyncing, is an attack technique first discovered in 2005. This method exploits discrepancies in the interpretation of non-standard HTTP requests among various HTTP devices between the client (attacker) and the server, including the server itself. It can be used to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and other security solutions, poison HTTP caches, inject responses to users, and hijack user requests.

One might assume that HTTP Request Smuggling would be rare in 2020, given the importance of adhering to RFC standards for HTTP parsers. Additionally, James Kettle's presentation at Black Hat 2019 raised significant awareness about this issue, and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software vendors should be able to review and patch their products easily. However, this is not the case.

In this presentation, I will demonstrate four new HTTP Request Smuggling attack variants that are effective against popular, present-day web servers and HTTP proxy servers. I will also showcase a successful attack using an older variant and a method to circumvent existing HTTP Request Smuggling protections in a free, open-source application security solution.

I will then discuss the limitations of current free, open-source solutions for mitigating HTTP Request Smuggling. To address these shortcomings, I have developed a C++ "Request Smuggling Firewall" class library. This library can be integrated into any user-space process (such as a web server or proxy server) to provide robust socket-level protection against HTTP Request Smuggling. The library is designed to be extensible, with potential applications beyond HTTP Request Smuggling and even beyond HTTP itself.

Finally, I will highlight some anomalies I have discovered in various web servers and proxy servers, and I will challenge the security research community to identify corresponding software vulnerabilities that could be exploited to create full-fledged HTTP Request Smuggling attacks.
