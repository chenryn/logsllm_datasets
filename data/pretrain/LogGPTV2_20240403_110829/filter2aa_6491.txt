# Smash
Reversing, 150 points
## Description
> We discovered this old CD from the 90s in our attic. It looks like it used to register you to a WWE betting community back in the day, but we seem to have lost the access code. Can you get us in?
A binary file was attached.
## Solution
Let's run the binary:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/sunshine/Smash# ./WrestleOfMania
WRESTLE-O-MANIA! We bring your wrestling bets to the internet.
All rights reserved, 1991.
Beginning your installation.....
Please enter your access code: test
ERROR: Access code invalid.
```
Looks like we'll have to provide a valid access code in order to proceed.
Let's take a look at the Ghidra decompilation output (function names were included, all other labels and types are user-defined):
```c
undefined4 main(undefined1 param_1)
{
  char *pcVar1;
  uint uVar2;
  undefined4 uVar3;
  char user_key [31];
  int local_14;
  puts("WRESTLE-O-MANIA! We bring your wrestling bets to the internet.");
  puts("All rights reserved, 1991.");
  printf("Beginning your installation");
  fflush(stdout);
  local_14 = 0;
  while (local_14 = ord('!'))
    solver.add(key[i] <= ord('~'))
in_arr = [5, 3, 6, 5, 2, 5, 3, 3, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 6, 6, 5]
for i in range(len(in_arr)):
    in_arr[i] = key[i] << (in_arr[i] & 0x1f)
expected_arr = [0xE60,         0x3A8,         0x1B80,        0xF60,
                0x120,         0xEA0,         0x188,         0x358,
                0x1A0,         0x9A0,         0x184,         0x4E0,
                0xC40,         0xC20,         0x5A0,         0x1C8,
                0x1D4,         0x9C0,         0x1CC,         0xB40,
                0xAE0,         0x62,          0x360,         0x340,
                0x5A0,         0x180,         0x6E0,         0xB40,
                0x1540,        0xFA0]
for i in range(len(expected_arr)):
    solver.add(expected_arr[i] == in_arr[i])
if solver.check() == sat:
    model = solver.model()
    #print(model)
    res = ""
    for i in range(KEY_LEN):
        res += chr(model[key[i]].as_long())
    print res
```
The output:
```console
