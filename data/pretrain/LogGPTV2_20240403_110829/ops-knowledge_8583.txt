User: Everything seems to be only available in self-extracting .exe. My company blocks executable files from being downloaded.
Assistant: The self-extracting exe is only necessary if the package contains C-code that needs to be compiled, and you don't have a compiler. Otherwise you can use the source package, which often is a tgz.
