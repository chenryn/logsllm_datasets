User: This is my first post here.  I am a very big fan of Stack Overflow.  This is the first time I could not find an answer to one of my questions.  
Here is the scenario:
In my Linux system, I am not an admin or root.  When I run a Python script, the output appears in the original folder, however when I run the same Python script as a Cron job, it appears in my accounts home folder.    Is there anything I can do to direct the output to a desired folder?   I do have the proper shebang path.
Thank you!
Assistant: Thanks for the responses after further searching, I found this that worked:
