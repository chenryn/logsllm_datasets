User: I am looking around in order to get an answer what is the max limit of results I can have from a GQL query on Ndb on Google AppEngine. I am using an implementation with cursors but it will be much faster if I retrieve them all at once.
Assistant: Basically you don't have the old limit of 1000 entities per query anymore, but consider using a reasonable limit, because you can hit the time out error and it's better to get them in batches so users won't wait during load time.
