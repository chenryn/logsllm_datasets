I am currently developing a blog using Next.js and I would like to add a contact form to my contact page, allowing visitors to send emails via Nodemailer. As I am relatively new to Express, I am feeling a bit overwhelmed and unsure of the best approach.

Should I customize the Next.js server, or should I set up a separate server for handling the form submissions? If a separate server is recommended, how does it integrate with my Next.js application?

At present, I have a form rendering on `pages/contact`, and I am not concerned about the specifics of sending the email using Nodemailer. My main confusion lies in where and how to configure the server-side logic to handle the form submissions.

What would be the recommended approach for implementing this contact form?

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
