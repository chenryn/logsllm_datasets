I am building a blog with Next.js. I need my contact page to include a contact
form so visitors can send emails via Nodemailer.
I am fairly new to Express so I feel in a little over my head. Should I be
customizing the Next.js server?
Or should I make a separate server? If so, is that completely separate from my
Next.js app?
I currently have pages/contact rendering a form. I am not worried about
actually sending the email and all that Nodemailer stuff. I just don't
understand where I should be hooking up my configurations.
What would be the recommended way to do implement such a contact form?
Any help greatly appreciated. Thank you!
