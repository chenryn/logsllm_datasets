Challenge Bonfire: Friendly Date Ranges
Strange test cases. I think they is expired:  
friendly(["2015-07-01", "2015-07-04"]) should return ["July 1st","4th"]  
friendly(["2016-03-01", "2016-05-05"]) should return ["March 1st","May 5th"]
"July 1st","4th"  
"March 1st","May 5th"
User can't understand that it is 2015 and 2016 years.
