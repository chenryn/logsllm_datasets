Syntax
ksetup /delkpasswd  
Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the uppercase DNS name, such as CORP.CONTOSO.COM, and is listed as the default realm or Realm= when ksetup is run.
Specifies the Kerberos password server. It's stated as a case-insensitive, fully-qualified domain name, such as mitkdc.contoso.com. If the KDC name is omitted, DNS might be used to locate KDCs.
Examples
To make sure the realm CORP.CONTOSO.COM uses the non-Windows KDC server mitkdc.contoso.com as the password server, type:
ksetup /delkpasswd CORP.CONTOSO.COM mitkdc.contoso.com
To make sure the realm CORP.CONTOSO.COM is not mapped to a Kerberos password server (the KDC name), type ksetup on the Windows computer and then view the output.
