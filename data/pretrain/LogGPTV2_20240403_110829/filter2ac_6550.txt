**ATT&CK ID:** M1040  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Behavior Prevention on Endpoint

**Description:**
On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) attacks and the spawning of child processes from Office applications. This can be achieved by configuring the following ASR rules:

- **Block DDE attacks**: This rule helps mitigate DDE-based attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in Office applications.
- **Block process creation originating from Office communication applications**: This rule prevents Office applications from creating child processes, which is a common technique used by malware to execute malicious code.

By implementing these ASR rules, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your endpoints and reduce the risk of exploitation through these attack vectors.
