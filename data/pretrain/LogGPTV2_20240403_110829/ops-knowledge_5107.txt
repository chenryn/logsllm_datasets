User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Minimizing SQL transaction log file size on developer box running simple recovery model We have a lot of SQL servers on development environment where we never take backup of the databases (TFS for code is enough).

The (SharePoint) databases are all set to simple recovery model, but the log files, especially for the SharePoint configuration database is growing quite large and filling up our data drive on the SQL server.

Since these log files are never used for anything, i would like advice on how to best minimize the size of these log files -or even disable them if possible.

I'm not completely sure why the log files grow so large even on simple logging (checked for long running transactions (DBCC OPENTRAN) but found none).

I guess the reason for the log files not being truncated is, that we don't take any backups, and hence Checkpoints aren't reached.

The autogrowth for log files are set to autogrow by 10% restricted to 2 gb, so i guess that is why Checkpoint (70%) aren't reached here either.

What would be the be best strategy to keep log files small (best case 0) without sacrificing performance (eg VLF fragmentation)?

Assistant: Are you running any maintenance jobs that could be doing any reindexing or other heavy work? Even with simple recovery, the log will need to be at least large enough to hold the largest transaction issued against the database. Try running DBCC SQLPERF(LOGSPACE) and check how much of the log file is actually in use. If it's very low, then simple recovery is likely working as intended, and the log file is probably only growing because it needs to be that large to support some larger-than-average transaction.
