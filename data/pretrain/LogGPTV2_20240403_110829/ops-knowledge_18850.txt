User: I am trying to deploy Django and Apache to Amazon EC2 server. Currently, i have already got the AWS account and lunched the instance on server. But the problem is that i cannot find a tutorial about how to deploy Django and Apache to Amazon EC2 WITH Mac OS, all i can find are Linux system deploying tutorials. Where can i find deploying tutorial for Mac OS?
Assistant: You use Terminal to SSH into your AWS EC2 environment. All commands past there are 100% platform based (ubuntu, amazon linux, red hat, etc).
You wouldn't use any Mac OS commands besides creating the SSH connection. There's a tutorial on how to do that through the EC2 console.
