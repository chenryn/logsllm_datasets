### 8.2 Selection of Discrete Meyer Wavelets

The decision to use discrete Meyer wavelets in the signal dictionary was based on their superior performance compared to other wavelet types, as demonstrated on the GEANT dataset. The results, presented in Table 2, show that using the discrete Meyer wavelet results in nearly 1,500 fewer false alarms compared to the next best wavelet type, Haar wavelets, when detecting all anomalies in the GEANT dataset.

Intuitively, the Meyer wavelet is well-suited for representing localized sinusoidal behavior, which is commonly found in non-anomalous network data. In contrast, Haar wavelets are more adept at capturing sharp signal discontinuities, and Daubechies wavelets are better suited for representing polynomial structures. Neither of these characteristics is expected to be prevalent in non-anomalous network data. The superior performance of the Meyer wavelet transform justifies its use throughout the remaining experiments.

### 8.3 Tuning Parameter Performance Analysis

The BasisDetect framework employs a series of tuning parameters (γ, ρ) to optimize performance. To evaluate the impact of these parameters on the false alarm rate, we conducted experiments on the GEANT dataset by setting each parameter to zero and observing the resulting performance. The results are shown in Figure 5.

As depicted in the figure, the full BasisDetect methodology, including both optimized tuning parameters, significantly outperforms the methods with either parameter eliminated in terms of the number of false alarms declared. When the anomaly signal component penalty (γ = 0) is removed, the method reverts to a standard greedy basis pursuit approach, which consistently underperforms the full BasisDetect methodology for every anomaly in the GEANT dataset. This indicates that the penalized approach of BasisDetect offers a clear performance advantage over standard basis pursuit methods.

When the residual signal is ignored (ρ = 0), the results show better performance than the non-penalized BasisDetect method for most detected anomalies, but still worse than the full BasisDetect methodology. In this case, the method fails to detect the last fraction of anomalies, declaring a large number of false alarms. This suggests that the basis pursuit methodology struggles to fit the anomalies to the estimated anomalous signal dictionary, likely due to limited training data. These results underscore the importance of using both tuning parameters in the full BasisDetect framework.

### 8.4 Synthesized Network-wide Data

Using the synthetic network-wide traffic matrix technique described in Section 3.1, we generated network-wide data with injected anomalies. To compare the performance of our BasisDetect methodology, we used two state-of-the-art network-wide anomaly detection techniques: the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique from [1] and the Distributed Spatial anomaly detection technique from [2]. The injected anomalies varied in amplitude and length, while the level of added noise varied between network snapshots. Our detection methodologies were tested to detect both the beginning and end of each injected anomaly.

For the initial synthetic experiment, we evaluated the performance of the three network-wide anomaly detection methodologies using data with constant injected anomaly amplitudes (aanomaly) across all network snapshots. We used 20 synthesized network snapshots, each with a single injected anomaly, and varied the length of the anomaly (between 2 and 8 time bins) and the size of the network (between 3 and 5 fully connected routers, corresponding to 9 and 25 observed links, respectively). Each network snapshot simulated 2.5 days of packet out link observations, aggregated into 5-minute time bins, resulting in a 1024-length time-series vector for each synthetic link.

Using hold-out cross-validation, we trained our BasisDetect methodology on 4 of the network snapshots and tested its performance on the remaining 16 networks. We considered three anomaly amplitude regimes: low (aanomaly = 0.063), medium (aanomaly = 0.1), and high (aanomaly = 0.158). Examples of these injected anomaly regimes are shown in Figure 6.

The experiment results in Figure 7 show that, for all three amplitude regimes, our BasisDetect methodology outperforms the current state-of-the-art detection techniques in terms of the number of false alarms declared across all 16 test networks. Table 3 provides a breakdown of the false alarms declared for various detection levels. As seen in the table, the BasisDetect methodology performs significantly better than both the PCA and Distributed Spatial methodologies.

For the medium amplitude anomaly (aanomaly = 0.1), BasisDetect detects all anomalies with over 54% fewer false alarms than the Distributed Spatial method and over 75% fewer false alarms than the PCA methodology.
