User: Why is it a good practice to use primary key in database design? Please provide at least two reasons.
Assistant: 1. Convenient and unique identification of records: The primary key is used to uniquely identify each record, which ensures that there are no duplicate records in the database. This is critical for data consistency, correctness and completeness. Without a primary key, it is difficult to ensure that each record is unique. 2. Improve query efficiency: The primary key can become an index in the table, which can improve the efficiency of data retrieval and query. If there is no primary key, querying data may require scanning the entire table, which is unacceptable for large databases. A database with a primary key can achieve fast data retrieval by indexing the primary key field.
