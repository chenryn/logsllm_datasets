### Set ID (Diskpart)

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `set id` command changes the partition type field for the focused partition. This command is not applicable to dynamic disks or Microsoft Reserved partitions.

**Important:**
This command is intended for use by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) only. Changing partition type fields with this parameter can cause your computer to fail or be unable to boot. Unless you are an OEM or have experience with GPT disks, do not change partition type fields on GPT disks using this parameter. Instead, always use the following commands:
- `create partition efi` to create EFI system partitions.
- `create partition msr` to create Microsoft Reserved partitions.
- `create partition primary` without the `ID` parameter to create primary partitions on GPT disks.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
set id={<hexadecimal_value> | <GUID>} [override] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **<hexadecimal_value>**: For MBR disks, specifies the new value for the type field in hexadecimal form. The leading `0x` is omitted. Any partition type byte can be specified except for `0x42`, which specifies an LDM partition.
- **<GUID>**: For GPT disks, specifies the new GUID value for the type field. Recognized GUIDs include:
  - **EFI system partition**: `c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b`
  - **Basic data partition**: `ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7`
  - **Excluded GUIDs**:
    - **Microsoft Reserved partition**: `e3c9e316-0b5c-4db8-817d-f92df00215ae`
    - **LDM metadata partition on a dynamic disk**: `5808c8aa-7e8f-42e0-85d2-e1e90434cfb3`
    - **LDM data partition on a dynamic disk**: `af9b60a0-1431-4f62-bc68-3311714a69ad`
    - **Cluster metadata partition**: `db97dba9-0840-4bae-97f0-ffb9a327c7e1`

- **override**: Forces the file system on the volume to dismount before changing the partition type. If `override` is not specified and the call to lock the file system fails (e.g., due to an open handle), the operation will fail. If `override` is specified, DiskPart will force the dismount even if the call to lock the file system fails, and any open handles to the volume will become invalid.

- **noerr**: Used for scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**

- To set the type field to `0x07` and force the file system to dismount:
  ```plaintext
  set id=0x07 override
  ```

- To set the type field to a basic data partition:
  ```plaintext
  set id=ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7
  ```
