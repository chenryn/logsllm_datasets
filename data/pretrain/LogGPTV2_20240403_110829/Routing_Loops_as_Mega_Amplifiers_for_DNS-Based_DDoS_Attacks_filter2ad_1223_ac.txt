per individual IPv6 DNS scan.
We trace the path to all 435 unique destination IP addresses in groups two
and three (see Table 1) immediately after the end of the scan. Notice that certain
destination IP addresses form more than one response tuple and, consequently,
may appear in multiple groups, which is actually the case for one destination
host that belongs to both groups two and three. The great majority of tracer-
outes (67%) did not reach measured destinations, even though they triggered
repeating DNS responses. We found 115 unique loops towards 392 tested hosts.
Importantly, Nawrocki et al. [39] have shown that roughly 90% of all the DNS
DDoS events captured at the IXP used up to 100 ampliﬁers. Therefore, the dis-
covered 115 loops are suﬃcient to mount real-world attacks. As for the remain-
ing 43 destination IP addresses, we consider that packets may have encountered
transient loops during the scan, which disappeared at the time of the traceroute
measurements.
Traceroute loop lengths vary greatly and involve up to 38 interface IP
addresses, but most often 2 (39 loops). Interestingly, 6 loops involved reserved
IP addresses from private [36] and shared address ranges [58].
Overall, IP addresses involved in 115 routing loops originated from 35
autonomous systems. As for the location, 102 loops involved destination
autonomous systems. Consequently, the great majority of all the routing loops
could potentially be triggered from diﬀerent vantage points.
5.3 Longitudinal Analysis
To test whether the threat of response ﬂoods is constantly present, we analyzed
the results of regular DNS scans that we have been performing since February
2020 (22 IPv4 and 22 IPv6 scans). For each scan, we ﬁrst identify the response
returned the maximum number of times. We plot the highest packet ampliﬁca-
tion factors for IPv4 in Fig. 3 (note that the y-axis is on a logarithmic scale).

There are apparent outliers (highlighted in red): three scans generated 28, 69, and
655 million responses maximum, all triggered by sending one request to hosts
in three diﬀerent autonomous systems. Overall, these biggest response ﬂoods
lasted between 7 s and 39 h. However, occasionally resent A requests could keep
restarting these loops.
We take a closer look at the maximum PAF ever observed. One query to
a host from an autonomous system in the Philippines generated 655 million
SERVFAIL responses sent during 2 days. It is the same autonomous system that
triggered most of the repeated responses during our latest scan. We performed
a traceroute measurement towards this destination and found a routing loop
involving 9 hosts from two autonomous systems (including the destination AS),
21 hops from the scanner. Note that this particular traceroute was limited to 64
hops. Overall, the maximum PAF per IPv4 scan varies between 8,795 and 655
million, the average maximum is 35 million.
On the other hand, for IPv6, the revealed ampliﬁcation factors are less
impressive. Figure 4 presents PAF for IPv6 (note that the y-axis is now in
linear scale). The maximum PAF is 60, thus there are no inﬁnite routing loops
(unless the looping packet was dropped early). The average maximum ampliﬁ-
cation factor is 22. The IPv6 results should be interpreted with caution due to
the composition of the IPv6 hitlist [17]. It contains responsive IPv6 addresses,
whereas one of the root causes of routing loops is sending packets to announced
but not allocated IP space. We performed an additional scan of randomly sam-
pled 50 million IPv6 addresses from each routable/40 IPv6 network but did not
trigger any routing loop.
Table 3 presents the same results as Table 1 in Sect. 5.1, but this time aggre-
gated over two years. Similar to our latest scan, the great majority of repeating
requests were sent between 2 and 9 times. The average ampliﬁcation factors
remain similar between groups 1 and 2, but the largest revealed ampliﬁer signif-
icantly increased the average PAF of group 3. Altogether, the scanner received
nearly 1 million repeated responses corresponding to 1.4 billion packets during
two years. The destination IP addresses are distributed among 21,804 unique
autonomous systems. More than half of autonomous systems in groups two and
three appeared during two or more scans. Consequently, the routing loops on
the way to these networks were very likely persistent and required a manual ﬁx.

6 Ethical Considerations and Disclosure
Research scans are widespread these days, allowing for quick and eﬃcient discov-
ery of all sorts of vulnerabilities and misconﬁgurations. Nevertheless, measure-
ment studies require careful planning so that risks are minimized and beneﬁts
outweigh potential inconveniences [14]. As there is no mechanism to explicitly
request permission to scan each IP address in advance, researchers developed
a set of guidelines [15] to inform network operators about the scanning nature
and opt-out easily. We follow those guidelines and conﬁgure our domain name
(and all the subdomains) to point to a web page explaining who we are and
what we do. The provided contact email address can be used to opt-out from
future scans. In addition, we do not consecutively scan all the hosts of a single
network but randomize our input. We received one complaint during the scan
and removed 1 autonomous system from the experiment, containing 32k IPv4
addresses.
Discovered routing loops raise a signiﬁcant threat to networks containing
them and those receiving the response ﬂood. We have used the Registration
Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [16,41] protocol to ﬁnd contact information for
the IP addresses involved in routing loops and notify the corresponding network
administrators. In our emails, we explain how we discovered the vulnerability
and the potential consequences.
7 Related Work
The number of open DNS resolvers dropped substantially in recent years – from
17.8 million in 2015 [26] to around 2 million in 2021 [4,25,40,52]. Yet, DNS
has been heavily involved in reﬂection and ampliﬁcation attacks [20,21]. In their
recent work, Nawrocki et al. [39] extensively analyzed the whole DNS ampliﬁca-
tion ecosystem, using data from honeypots, an Internet Exchange Point (IXP),
active measurements, and Internet-wide scans. They have shown that DNS-based
ampliﬁcation attacks are even more present than previously thought. Alarmingly,
the attackers do not yet fully exploit all the available ampliﬁcation potential.
One approach to the detection of DNS ampliﬁers is to craft a single request
that will produce a large response. MacFarland et al. [34] issued A and ANY
requests for 363 million (domain name, authoritative nameserver IP address)
pairs to identify ampliﬁed responses. They reached a 32.77 ampliﬁcation factor
for ANY type query with EDNS0 enabled. It was later shown that ANY responses
for DNSSEC-signed domains can reach the ampliﬁcation factor of 179 [46].
Another approach is to create one DNS request that will trigger a series
of additional lookups. The DNS Unchained attack requests recursive resolvers
to follow a long chain of CNAME resource records [6]. Even more destructive
is a recently discovered NXNSAttack, which relies on bogus referrals that can
overwhelm both recursive resolvers and authoritative nameservers [1].
More generally, the stateless nature of UDP allows many protocols, apart
from DNS, to be used for reﬂection and ampliﬁcation. Rossow [47] analyzed 14
640
Y. Nosyk et al.
popular UDP-based protocols with ampliﬁcation factors between 3.8 (BitTor-
rent, NetBios) and 4,670 (NTP). The latter, NTP, is infamous for its high DDoS
potential and is often seen in real-world attacks [20]. Czyz et al. [11] estimated
that roughly 2.2 million NTP servers could be misused. Earlier, K¨uhrer et al. [27]
cooperated with CERTs, NOCs, clearinghouses, and other security organizations
worldwide to improve the NTP ampliﬁer landscape.
It was long believed that the three-way handshake prevents TCP from being
abused in reﬂection attacks with spoofed requests. In practice, one can trigger
remote servers to retransmit (up to 20 times) unacknowledged SYN/ACK segments
before the handshake is completed [27]. Additionally, other types of TCP miscon-
ﬁgurations (such as repeating RST packets or the actual data being transmitted
before the handshake is completed) result in an average ampliﬁcation factor of
112 [28]. Finally, recent work has gone beyond the initial handshake and found
how network middleboxes can be used to reﬂect and amplify TCP traﬃc towards
victims [5].
The method presented in this paper does not require any complex setup or
speciﬁcally crafted requests to amplify the response. We rely on a trivial UDP
packet to trigger routing loops.
8 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we have shown how a single DNS A request can generate a response
packet ﬂood. We have scanned all the routable IPv4 address space and found
15,909 end-hosts in 1,742 autonomous systems that triggered the repeating
responses with the maximum packet ampliﬁcation factor of 46.7 million. We
have collected traceroute measurements towards the destinations that triggered
most responses and found 115 routing loops. We have disclosed our ﬁndings to
network operators. Overall, having analyzed two years of our DNS scans, we have
found 18 query destinations that triggered more than one million responses. The
historical data reveals that this phenomenon is not a one-time event. At any
instant, an attacker can locate ampliﬁers with little eﬀort, trigger them, and
redirect the generated traﬃc to a victim.
We foresee three directions for future work. First, we plan to identify
and further characterize those devices triggering response packet ﬂoods. Sec-
ond, we intend to perform scans from geographically distributed vantage
points. Although we have shown that the majority of loops involve destina-
tion autonomous systems, there may be more loops in transit. Finally, we will
explore which other query types and protocols can be used to trigger routing
loops as easily as DNS.
