# Bug report
The intention is to import a CSS file from third party library that resides in
a folder within node_modes. This CSS chunk is not bundled on initial page load
(which is fine , I assume, because the client hasn't navigated to the page
where the import happens - yet).  
But as soon as one tries to navigate to the page that has the import statement
(via client-side routing), nothing seems to happen.
## Environment
  * Next.js 7
  * Development mode
  * withCSS plugin registered via
> const withCSS = require('@zeit/next-css')  
>  module.exports = withCSS({/* my next config */})
## Bug description
My intention is to lazy load CSS file from third party library that resides in
a folder within node_modes.
This is what I've done in /pages/pageThatUsesCssFromLibrary.js (see linked
demo project below)
> import 'rc-slider/dist/rc-slider.min.css';
That works fine when using server rendering, i.e. write
http://localhost:3000/pageThatUsesCssFromLibrary into the browser's address
bar and hit enter.
However, it does not work if I'm navigating to that page through client-side
navigation, i.e. navigate to http://localhost:3000 and clicking a Link that
navigates to the page:
Go to page
Clicking to the link does not appear to do anything (not even displaying an
error message).
## To Reproduce
_Working example_
  1. Build the linked demo project
  2. Write http://localhost:3000/pageThatUsesCssFromLibrary into the address bar, hit Enter and see how the site is displayed (and the CSS is imported properly) when the page is rendered on the _server side_
_Example that exposes the reported bug_
  1. Build the linked demo project
  2. Write http://localhost:3000 and hit Enter
  3. Follow the hyperlink
  4. See nothing happens
## Expected behaviour
The application should navigate to
https://localhost:3000/pageThatUsesCssFromLibrary and display its content
properly.
