User: How to deal with DDoS attacks? Please provide some possible defenses and tools.
Assistant: 1. Preventive measures: 1. Use DDoS cleaning service: By routing all access traffic to a server responsible for protection by a third party, it is possible to prevent attack traffic from reaching the local network. 2. Configure the firewall: the firewall can restrict access according to allowing or blocking certain types of traffic, so as to avoid DOS attacks. 3. Use load balancing: Using a load balancer can help distribute traffic and reduce attack pressure. 4. Upgrade website bandwidth: Increasing bandwidth can make it easier for the website to handle more traffic, thereby preventing DOS attacks. 5. Limiting the traffic rate: Limiting the traffic rate can prevent a large number of requests from occupying network resources and prevent DOS attacks. 6. Real-time network monitoring: Timely detection of network traffic can help identify and quickly mitigate DOS attacks. Second, defense tools: 1. Firewall: such as Cisco, Checkpoint, Juniper and other firewalls can help detect and prevent DOS attacks. 2. Load balancer: Load balancers such as F5, Radware, Kemp, etc. can help distribute traffic and reduce attack pressure. 3. DDoS cleaning services: For example, DDoS cleaning services such as Cloudflare, Akamai, and Arbor can prevent attack traffic from reaching the local network. 4. Traffic analysis tools: such as Snort, Wireshark, Tcpdump and other traffic analysis tools can help detect abnormal traffic. 5. Defense software: Defense software such as Anti-DDoS Guardian and DDoS Deflate can help block traffic attacks.
