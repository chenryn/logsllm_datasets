UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice
As the world becomes more connected, 
companies have found that wireless technology 
can be leveraged to increase efficiency and 
overall productivity while reducing unnecessary 
costs associated with cabling infrastructure. 
Wireless systems also allow for quicker 
sharing of information than wired networks by 
reducing wait times on data transfers between 
different devices within an organization. 
While these benefits are apparent, wireless 
communication systems are susceptible to 
various security threats that can compromise 
their reliability and impact production operations.
In an effort to strengthen the security of 
devices utilizing Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio 
waves, Nozomi Networks Labs conducted a 
security assessment of two popular UWB Real 
Time Locating Systems (RTLS) available on the 
market. In our research, we discovered zero-
day vulnerabilities and other weaknesses that, 
if exploited, could allow an attacker to gain full 
access to all sensitive location data exchanged 
over-the-air. 
In this white paper, we demonstrate how an 
attacker may exploit RTLS to locate and target 
people and objects, hinder safety geofencing 
rules, and interfere with contact tracing. We also 
present key actions that companies can take 
to help mitigate these risks and implement a 
secure wireless network infrastructure.
UWB is a wireless communication protocol that uses radio 
waves to determine precision and ensure communication 
of peer devices. It is ideal for short-range devices because it 
has a relatively small wavelength, meaning it can transmit 
information quickly over short distances.1
UWB is used in many different types of applications ranging 
from consumer electronics to medical devices to industrial 
automation. Many companies are now using UWB technology 
in their products to take advantage of its unique properties, 
including its ability to send data through solid objects, like 
walls and other barriers, without losing quality or slowing 
down transmission speeds. This is opposed to other radio 
frequencies (RFs), such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, which use 
narrow-band radio waves for more line-of-sight precision over 
longer distances.

UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice
1. Introduction
UWB is the preferred communication protocol for RTLS, 
which is a technology that uses radio-frequency signals 
to locate both stationary and mobile objects. RTLS 
consists of three components: tags that are attached to 
assets, anchors that receive the wireless signal, and a 
computer system that processes and stores tag positions. 
When an asset passes through an area with a tag 
attached to it, the tag sends out a signal which is received 
by computers connected to the system. The computers 
analyzes the signal's time of arrival to determine its 
distance from the asset, and then information is stored 
into the database.
UWB utilizes the following positioning techniques:
1. Two Way Ranging (TWR): This method calculates the 
Time of Flight (TOF) of an electromagnetic wave by 
measuring the time it takes for a wave to travel from one 
point to another. This method is mostly used for hands-
free access control or locating lost items.2
2. Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA): This method uses 
multiple anchors deployed within a given facility. When 
the anchors receive a beacon from a tagged device, the 
timestamp of the beacon will be analyzed to correlate the 
position of the device.3 This method is mostly used when 
tracking personnel in facilities. 
This research will focus on the latter technique, TDoA.

1. Introduction

5  “UWB Use Cases,” FiRa Consortium.
UWB RTLS are used in manifold use cases: from smart 
building and mobility to industrial, from smart retail to smart 
home and consumer. Two examples of use cases follow. 
In production environments, RTLS uses radio frequency 
technology to locate components in various stages of 
production from the time they are created until they are 
delivered to the customer. The system allows for a precise 
positioning of each component in its own unique location, 
ensuring that the component does not get mixed up with 
others or placed incorrectly during assembly. The system 
also allows for automatic release of components when 
they reach their designated areas so that they do not 
have to be handled manually by workers; this reduces the 
possibility of errors during final assembly.4
RTLS is also used in access control systems, which have 
traditionally been cumbersome and inconvenient. They 
required the user to either wave their credential in front of 
a sensor or insert it into a lock, which can be difficult to do 
if a person is carrying items or wants to just walk through 
a door without stopping. UWB RTLS allows the lock and 
unlock functions to happen in response to movements 
and positioning, making accessing buildings and vehicles 
hands-free and hassle-free.5
While there are many benefits to these technologies, 
when it comes to industrial environments, there is no 
shortage of potential security risks. With the growing use 
of wireless networks in the industrial space comes an 
increased likelihood that those networks will be vulnerable 
to attacks from cyber criminals who are seeking to exploit 
vulnerabilities in order to gain access to sensitive data or 
disrupt operations.

According to the Fine Ranging, or FiRa, consortium, there 
was an increased demand in 2018 for “improvements to 
existing modulations to increase the integrity and accuracy 
of ranging measurements.”6 In 2020, the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) released standard 
802.15.4 which provides guidance (protocols, specifications, 
etc.) for low-rate wireless network communications, 
replacing the outdated 2015 version. IEEE quickly followed 
up with the 802.15.4z amendment in 2020, which adds 
requirement to achieve security in wireless transmissions. 
The new physical layer (PHY), was added to the 802.15.4z 
specification to make it harder for attackers to access or 
manipulate UWB communications. The extra portion of the PHY 
acts as a kind of shield between the network and any external 
devices trying to access it.7 The addition of cryptography and 
random number generation was to ensure that no one can 
eavesdrop on or manipulate UWB communications.8
While these updates are an important step towards 
securing UWB, upon further review, we noticed that 
the synchronization and exchange of location data are 
considered out-of-scope by the standard, despite being 
critical aspects in RTLS. These communications, whose 
design is left entirely to vendors, are critical aspects for the 
overall posture of TDoA RTLS.
To the best of our knowledge, research on UWB RTLS 
focusing on the security of communications via Ethernet, 
Wi-Fi, or other media for the synchronization and exchange 
of location data has never been done in literature or 
appeared in a security conference.
For this reason, we decided to focus our research solely on 
these specific communications, to evaluate their security 
posture in an effort to strengthen the overall security of 
UWB RTLS.

UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice
In this chapter, we illustrate the entire 
methodology followed during our research, 
and the results obtained. We describe the 
scope of our investigation, illustrate the basic 
concepts behind the TDoA theory, explain all 
reverse engineering steps done during our 
analysis, show how an adversary can retrieve 
or estimate all information required for an 
attack, and demonstrate how they can abuse 
this knowledge to perform practical attacks 
against real-world scenarios. 
UWB RTLS are pervasive technologies that can be deployed 
in a plethora of conditions and for a wide variety of use cases. 
Additionally, they comprise manifold components and 
protocols. This chapter of the document defines both the 
industry scope and technical scope of our research.
2.1.1 Industry Scope
From parking structures to hospitals, from airports to 
factories, from retail to sports fields, UWB RTLS enable 
sophisticated localization-based services in the most 
disparate environments.
Given the breadth of industries that utilize UWB, we decided 
to limit the scope of our research to those that were both 
highly targeted and highly critical. These are expected to 
be the industries where a security flaw is most likely be 
exploited by adversaries, and lead to the highest impacts.
Among the various industries utilizing UWB RTLS, we 
focused our research on both the industrial and healthcare 
sectors. We decided to focus on these sectors primarily 
because the industrial and healthcare sectors have seen a 
surge in cyberattacks in recent years,9 and UWB RTLS are 
employed for safety-related purposes,10,11 (Figure 2), such as:
 y Employee and patient tracking: In factories, UWB 
RTLS help the facility's management system track and 
rescue any employees remaining onsite in the event of an 
emergency. In hospitals, they are used to track a patient’s 
position and quickly provide medical assistance in case 
of sudden, serious medical symptoms;
 y Geofencing: In both factories and hospitals, UWB RTLS 
enforce safety-geofencing rules. For instance, UWB RTLS 
can be configured to halt hazardous machinery in case 
a human is within close proximity, to prevent harmful 
consequences;
 y Contact tracing: UWB RTLS enables centralized 
contact tracing during major pandemics like COVID-19. 
By monitoring and tracking contact between people, 
it can determine who came in contact with someone 
who tested positive for COVID-19, so that necessary 
quarantine measures can be taken.
