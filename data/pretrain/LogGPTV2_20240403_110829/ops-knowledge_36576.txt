User: I need to make some Python applications for a work project. The target platform is AIX 5.3.
My question is: What version of Python should I be using?
My requirements are:

The Python version must be easy to install on the target machines. Others will do that according to instructions that I write, so no compiling from source or anything like that.
The Python version must have ncurses or curses support (I'm making a form handler).

I've found two different precompiled versions of Python for AIX, but one (2.1.something) didn't include the curses module, and the other (2.3.4, RPM format) had prerequisites that I failed to fulfill).
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Assistant: I'd compile it from source myself and tell them where to download it from in the instructions
