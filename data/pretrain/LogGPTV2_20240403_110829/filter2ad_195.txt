ABSTRACT
The paradigm of information-centric networking subsumes
recent approaches to integrate content replication services
into a future Internet layer. Current concepts foster either a
dynamic mapping that directs content requests to a nearby
copy, or an immediate routing on content identiﬁers. In this
paper, we evaluate in practical experiments the performance
of content routing, which we analyze with a focus on con-
ceptual aspects. Our ﬁndings indicate that the performance
of the content distribution system is threatened by a heavy
management of states that arise from the strong coupling
of the control to the data plane in the underlying routing
infrastructure.

INTRODUCTION
One major dedication of today’s Internet is the global dis-
tribution of content in huge amounts. Content distribution
networks (CDNs) facilitate an eﬃcient, wide-area replica-
tion of static data for selected content providers, whereas
the end-to-end design of TCP/IP does not foresee implicit
replication and in-network storage. There is no openly avail-
able standard solution for the asynchronous, global replica-
tion of popular content in the current Internet. Currently,
Information-Centric Networks (ICN) [1] propose to ﬁll this
gap.
Essentially two approaches to routing exist in current ICN
proposals, an evolutionary path that routes on IP, and ‘clean
slate’ concepts that route on content identities. NetInf ex-
tends the current Internet by a resolution service that maps
content names to topological IDs like IP addresses. TRIAD,
DONA and NDN perform content retrieval by routing on

names. Route responses and the data itself are then for-
warded along reverse paths (RPF), either by using IP as a
lower layer, or without IP but by dedicated RPF states.
Operating on the content itself forces network infrastruc-
ture into a content awareness. A mapping service is not
only required to resolve names to source locations, but must
advising a nearby replica, the existence of which it learned
from the data distribution system. Content routers need to
rely on names in its interface tables and – for RPF-based for-
warding schemes – a reverse state for every data unit. This
control information is highly dynamic and requires regular
updates from the data plane. The ICN paradigm thereby
opens up the control plane to continuous modiﬁcations from
the data plane. This is in contrast to the current Internet,
where DNS and routing states remain unaltered by data-
driven events such as transmitted ﬁle names or data loca-
tions.
In this poster, we brieﬂy present our study [2] of joint con-
trol and data plane behaviour under varying data conditions
for the example of NDN [3] (§ 2). We are in particular inter-
ested in the response to load of the ICN infrastructure. Ex-
periments are performed in test networks running PARC’s
CCNx software and reveal a ﬂaw of performance (by con-
cept, not implementation) with increasing demands to the
routing system (§ 3).
2. BASIC MEASUREMENT SETUP
For our measurement study, we use the CCNx implemen-
tation version 0.5.1 [4], i.e., the client library to announce
content interests, the content repository to store data, and
the ccnd to forward subscription and data. The following
analysis focuses on the eﬀects on the router side. Even
though the measurements relate mainly to the ccnd, we do
not evaluate the implementation but use it as one real-world
instance of the information-centric network deployment to
illustrate protocol mechanisms. To gain a ﬁne-grained view,
we concentrate on the local system, as well as inter-router
dependencies.
The basic network topology is represented by a chain of
two CCNx routers directly interlinked at 100 Mbit/s, one
end connects the content consumer, the other the content
repository. We leave default values for all CCNx parameters.
CCNx routers communicate via TCP.
3. RESULTS
To analyze the performance of content consumption in our
experiment, the content receiver initiates parallel download
of multiple 10 Mbit ﬁles over a constant time. We consider
99(a) 2 ﬁles per second
(b) 10 ﬁles per second
(c) 100 ﬁles per second
Figure 1: Parallel download of 10 Mbit ﬁles: Start and stop time of the download per ﬁle at the receiver
& resource consumption at its designated router [Pending Interests (PI), Interest Retransmits (IR), and
Network Load (NL) including the mean goodput]
three extremes, the request of 2 ﬁles, 10 ﬁles, and 100 ﬁles
per second. Fig. 1 shows the start and completion time of
the download per ﬁle (top graph), the Pending Interest Table
(PIT) size, the eﬀective number of Interest retransmissions,
and the traﬃc load including the mean goodput at the ﬁrst
hop. For visibility reasons, we rescaled one y-axis (PI) in
Fig. 1(a).
With an increasing number of parallel downloads, not only
the download time increases signiﬁcantly, but also the inter-
val of the request and receive phase grows in the scenarios
of overload. While the download time is almost constant for
two ﬁles per second (cf., Fig. 1(a)), the stop time diverges
non-linearly from the beginning of the download in the cases
of excessive parallelism (cf., Fig. 1(b),(c)). 150 s are needed
to download each single ﬁle in the worst case (Fig. 1(c)),
while the link capacity would permit to retrieve all ﬁles in
about 10 s.
The reason for this performance ﬂaw is visualized in the
subjacent graphs. A higher download frequency leads to an
increasing number of simultaneous PIT entries, which re-
quire coordination with the data plane. Each ﬁle request
will be split into the request of multiple chunks, in which
the generation of corresponding interest messages will be
pipelined. As soon as the content traverses, Interest states
dissolve and thus release memory. These operations cause a
continuous maintenance of states triggered by data traversal,
and a simultaneous burst in CPU load (CPU exhaustion not
shown). Finally it results in growing Interest retransmits af-
ter droppings or timeouts (shown in second lowest graphs),
which again leads to retransmissions of data chunks. As an
overall net eﬀect, the network utilization ﬂuctuates signif-
icantly, but does not adapt to actual user demands: Even
though data requests could ﬁll the links easily, the average
load remains about constant at 30 %.
4. CONCLUSIONS & DISCUSSIONS
We have analyzed content-centric routing performance un-
der varying loads and closely examined the implications of
data-driven state management. The exhaustion of mem-
ory and processing resources following excessive state allo-
cations was identiﬁed as one major reason for service degra-
dation. It is worth noting that these eﬀects are not short-
comings of the CCNx implementation, but driven by con-
cept. Resource-intensive state management opens the ﬂoor
widely to DoS attacks. Threats arrive from resource exhaus-
tion, state decorrelation, and path and name inﬁltration [2].
An obvious approach to mitigate the resource exhaustion
problem is to limit the rates of state injection into the net-
work. Applying restrictions per user, though, will require
addressing and tracking of end nodes, and lead to traﬃc
shaping and bandwidth restrictions. As content states will
accumulate in the network, and inter-provider deployment
almost surely will lead to a heterogeneous, unbalanced net-
work transitions, rate limiting may milden, but cannot ef-
fectively prevent the resource exhaustion problems discussed
in this paper. Conceptual seem necessary to make content
centric networking scalable, robust, and resistant to infras-
tructure attacks.
