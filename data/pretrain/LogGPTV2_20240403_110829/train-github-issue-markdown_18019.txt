# Environment
    Windows build number: 18363.959
    PowerToys version: 0.19.2
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): PowerToys Run and/or Keyboard Manager
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Setup a Keyboard shortcut for Win+R -> Alt+Space

  2. (optional) Open PowerToys Run with Alt+Space, type some stuff (anything), hit Esc
  3. Open PowerToys Run with Win+R, note that you can hit backspace and escape, but typing anything else doesn't work.
  4. Now 'Alt' is soft-locked pressed on the machine and trying to interact with other windows/OS causes issues, like trying to hit Win+R again is actually trying to hit Win+Alt+R and start a GameBar recording.
# Expected behavior
Win+R should be able to bring up PowerToys Run normally, this worked fine
before, so seems like a regression?  
Alt key shouldn't get stuck 'down'.
# Actual behavior
Unable to type into Power Toys Run textbox, Alt key is getting stuck in
pressed state after closing PowerToys Run after using mapped shortcut.
