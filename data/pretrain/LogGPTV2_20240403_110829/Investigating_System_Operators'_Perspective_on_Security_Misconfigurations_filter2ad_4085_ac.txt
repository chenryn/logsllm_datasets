### Operators' Employment and Survey Structure

Operators in the field can be categorized into three main groups: independent consultants, company-employed operators, and former operators who remain involved in the community. To address these groups appropriately and to classify their responses, our questionnaire is divided into three branches (Figure 1). Each branch follows the same structure and types of questions but adjusts the wording to fit the operator’s employment situation (e.g., a consultant has clients, while an employed operator has managers).

### Job Environment

We also investigate the institutional environment in which operators work. This includes their job titles, whether these titles match their actual roles, and whether they identify as operators. Participants who do not consider themselves as operators are directed to an exit page, and we thank them for their participation. Additionally, we inquire about the size and industry of their organizations to facilitate an in-depth analysis of the prevalence of misconfigurations in future research.

### Daily Business

The next section of our survey focuses on the day-to-day activities of our respondents. We ask about the types of IT systems they manage and their self-assessed expertise in these areas. We also record their years of experience as operators to better understand their professional background.

### Consequences of Security Misconfigurations

To explore the consequences of security misconfiguration incidents, we ask whether the discovery of such misconfigurations led to a perceived change in the organization's security posture. We also inquire whether these changes were viewed as positive or negative. Participants are asked to compare the impact of actual security incidents with the mere discovery of misconfigurations. They have the option to select "I don’t know" if they lack experience or an opinion on the matter.

### Opinions on Misconfigurations

The final part of our questionnaire addresses the operators' opinions on statements derived from our qualitative interviews. For example, we ask whether they felt adequately trained to handle broken systems during their education and whether they believe there are too many configurable options today ("too many knobs"). Table 4 (Section 6) provides an overview of the statements analyzed. We also ask which systems they find particularly challenging to operate and why, as this information can highlight specific systems that researchers should investigate more closely.

### Demographics

To enable comparison with other studies, such as the USENIX LISA salary survey among operators [29], we collect demographic data from participants, including their work location, age range, and level of education.

### Dissemination Strategy

To increase participation in our study, we established a consistent brand across all dissemination channels to create a recognition effect. This brand was also used in the survey to ensure that participants recognized it across different platforms [37]. Establishing a recognizable brand was crucial for recruiting system operators, who are often harder to reach through traditional methods (e.g., monetary incentives due to higher compensation) and are more time-constrained. Our approach included using distinctive comics to illustrate concepts and clarify definitions (Figure 2). While we did not provide financial compensation, we offered participants the opportunity to receive updates on our research. To ensure the anonymity of survey responses, we collected email addresses through a separate form, fully separated from the survey.

Our multi-channel dissemination strategy included:
1. A presentation at the 76th RIPE Meeting, a regular gathering of the local IP address authority for Europe, the Middle East, and Russia.
2. Publishing articles in the blogs of the RIPE NCC [39] and APNIC [40], the latter being the address registry for Asia and Oceania.
3. Sending emails to operations mailing lists.
4. Engaging in social media activity within relevant industry communities.

We refrained from using community and "question and answer" sites like Server Fault [41] or Super User [42] due to their terms of service prohibiting advertising or conducting surveys. Despite our efforts, we occasionally received negative feedback that our study was unsolicited. We did not track participation to specific dissemination channels to avoid ethical concerns related to user tracking.

### Quantitative Results

**Participation:** The survey was published on July 19, 2017, and concluded 30 days later on August 17, 2017. We received 231 responses, with 80% recorded in the first 15 days. 78 participants subscribed to our mailing list for updates on our findings (Figure 3).

**Filtering:** Ten responses were excluded due to incorrect or incomplete data. Four of these submissions had no data, possibly due to Google Forms malfunctioning. The remaining six respondents stated they had never worked as operators, with two indicating they just liked disrupting surveys. Thus, our analysis is based on the remaining 221 current and former operators.

**Demographics:** The majority of respondents work in Germany (45.70%), with notable contributions from other parts of Europe, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (Figure 4(a)). The distribution of age and experience (Figures 4(b) and 4(c)) is similar to that of other regions, as shown by earlier studies for the U.S.-centric operations community [29]. In terms of education, 63.8% of respondents have at least a Bachelor’s degree, which contrasts with 41.7% in the last LISA salary survey [29].

**Employment Situation:** 89.1% of operators are employees, 8.2% are self-employed, and 2.7% are former operators. Nearly half (48.9%) of all participants consider their position to be at least partially managerial (e.g., team leaders). The participants work in a variety of industries, including IT enterprises, ISPs, government organizations, and non-IT sectors that rely on IT for core business operations.

### Security Misconfiguration Frequency

Our qualitative study suggests that security misconfigurations are more common than reported. To address this, we separated the responsibility domains and asked operators if they had personally misconfigured something and if they had found someone else's misconfiguration. For the self-reflective part, we provided the option to acknowledge potential undiscovered misconfigurations. We also inquired if any discovered misconfigurations led to a security incident. 

From 221 operators, 170 (76.92%) acknowledged having misconfigured a system, and 68 (30.8%) stated that at least one misconfiguration led to a security incident (Figure 5). Nine operators (4.1%) reported that one of their own security misconfigurations led to an incident, contradicting their prior statements. When prompted for specific incidents, the number of operators acknowledging their own security misconfigurations rose to 196 (88.7%). Only one operator (0.5%) claimed to have never encountered any of the specific misconfigurations mentioned.

Looking at specific types of misconfigurations (Table 3), the average operator made more than four different kinds of misconfigurations (4.3) and encountered more than eight (8.4). The most common self-made misconfigurations include delayed or missing updates, faulty scripting, and faulty firewall configuration (Figure 6). Among encountered misconfigurations, weak or default passwords, delayed or missing updates, and faulty assignment of permissions are the most frequently selected (also Figure 6). The relative frequency for self-made and encountered misconfigurations matches, except for straightforward violations of operational best practices.

**Discussion:** Almost all respondents encountered security-sensitive misconfigurations in practice, aligning with our qualitative interviews. There is a tendency for operators to be more willing to acknowledge misconfigurations if it does not attribute guilt to them, highlighting the importance of blameless postmortems. The most frequent issues are weak or default passwords, lax permissions, and delayed (security) updates, followed by insufficient and too permissive firewall rules.

### Organizational Factors and Management

In our questionnaire, we asked operators to identify misconfiguration facilitating factors. The most frequent personal factors are a lack of knowledge (78.73%) and a lack of experience (75.57%), aligning with our qualitative interviews. Environmental factors include sole responsibility (76.92%) and insufficient quality assurance (73.30%). Organizational aspects stand out in the questionnaire, while social issues were more prominent in the qualitative interviews.

Regarding management, operators consider poor financial decisions and unqualified leadership less of an issue than indicated in the initial qualitative interviews. Only a third of operators (39.37%) see unqualified leadership as a cause for security misconfigurations, and less than a third (30.77%) point to financial decisions. Surprisingly, operators generally agree that their direct supervisors understand what they do (Table 4, line 7).

However, this opinion varies by organization type. Operators from non-IT backgrounds (avg. 0.534) and the government sector (avg. 0.474) are significantly less convinced that their superiors know what they are doing (p < 0.15 in Pearson’s χ²). Trust in tools and equipment is generally low, with a global average of -0.651. Younger operators (< 1 year in the field, avg. 0.400) still trust their tools, while more experienced operators (3-5 years, avg. -0.462) increasingly distrust them, culminating in an average disagreement of -1.032 for operators with more than 20 years of experience (p < 0.005 in Pearson’s χ²).

**Discussion:** Based on our survey, major obstacles for secure operations and preventing security misconfigurations lie on the organizational side. The sector of an organization impacts the perceived IT aptitude of managers. Non-IT organizations should offer additional training for IT middle managers promoted from diverse backgrounds. Strategies to mitigate misconfigurations should focus on reducing sole responsibility, introducing more quality assurance and automation, and ensuring reasonable workloads. Personal factors, such as a lack of knowledge or experience, can be mitigated indirectly by addressing organizational factors.

The decreasing trust in tools over the course of operators' careers is a significant issue. This may be due to continuous frustration with tools not meeting expectations. This increasing distrust can negatively affect the deployment of mitigations, as operators may not correctly deploy them or find ways around them. This effect aligns with fundamental conclusions from safety science analyses [46].
