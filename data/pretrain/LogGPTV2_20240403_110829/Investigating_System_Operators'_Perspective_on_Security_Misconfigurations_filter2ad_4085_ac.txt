operators were working as independent consultants, other opera-
tors were employed by a company, and others again have left the
profession, but remain involved in the operations community and
still have important insights to share. To address these three groups
correctly in wording and to classify their responses appropriately,
ourquestionnaireisdividedinthreebranches (Figure1).Eachbranch
uses the same structure and types of questions, but the wording is
adjusted to fit the operator’s employment situation (e.g., a consul-
tant has customers, while an employed operator has managers).
Job Environment. We also investigate the institutional environ-
ment that the operators work in. This includes the operators’ job
titles, whether it matches what they are actually doing, and, if they
perceive themselves as operators. Participants that did not consider
themselves as operators are led to an exit page, and we thank them
for their participation. We also ask about the organizations’ size or
industry for an in-depth analysis of the prevalence of misconfigura-
tions in future work.
Daily Business. The next part of our survey deals with what our
respondents do on a day-to-day basis, for example, what kind of IT
systems they operate and how they would estimate their expertise
in the respective fields. Furthermore, to assess working experience,
we also record how long they have been operators.

Investigating System Operators’ Perspective on Security Misconfigurations
CCS ’18, October 15–19, 2018, Toronto, ON, Canada
Consequences. Investigating consequences of a security miscon-
figuration incident relates to the reoccurring theme that incidents
supposedly change a company’s security posture. Hence, we in-
quire whether the discovery of security misconfigurations resulted
in a perceived change in security posture, and whether the opera-
tors perceived possible changes as for the better or for the worse.
Concerning the influence of a security incident, participants com-
pare the impact of actual security incidents to the mere discovery of
misconfigurations. For both questions, they are free to pick I don’t
know if they have no experience or opinion on the matter.
Opinions. The last misconfiguration-related part of our question-
naireaddressestheoperators’opinionsonstatementsfromourqual-
itative interviews. Questions include, for example, whether the op-
erators felt they were taught how to deal with broken systems over
the course of their education, and whether they think that too many
optionsareconfigurablenowadays(“toomanyknobs”).Table4(Sec-
tion 6) provides an overview of the statements that we analyze. Fur-
thermore, we inquire which systems they find particularly hard to
operate and why (in a free-text field), as they may point at particu-
larly hard-to-use or unpopular systems that researchers should in-
vestigate more closely.
Demographics. To allow comparison of our data with other stud-
ies, such as the USENIX LISA salary survey among operators [29],
we collect demographic data on the participants. This includes their
work location, age range, and level of education.
5.2 Dissemination
To increase participation in our study, we established a brand in our
dissemination channels to utilize a recognition effect that spans all
dissemination channels. We also used this brand in our survey, so
that participants recognized our survey throughout different dis-
semination channels [37]. Establishing a recognizable brand was
particularly crucial to recruit system operators, who are more diffi-
culttorecruitthroughtraditionalmechanisms(e.g.,monetarily,due
to generally higher compensation) and more time constrained (i.e.,
they might not participate the first time they encounter the study),
because information and reminders about the study were more eas-
ily and immediately recognizable. We did this through comics in a
distinctive drawing style (e.g., Figure 2). Our drawings also proved
useful for illustrating concepts, clarifying definitions, and what we
were asking for in the questionnaire. Furthermore, while we did
not compensate participants, we provided them the opportunity to
be informed about any updates on our research project. To ensure
anonymity of survey responses, we collected the email addresses
through a separate form, which was fully separated from the survey.
We used a multi-channel approach to disseminate our study di-
rectly within the operations community:
(1) A presentation at the 76th RIPE Meeting, which is the reg-
ular meeting of the local IP address authority for Europe,
the Middle-East, and Russia, where we also used the afore-
mentioned drawing-style to establish the brand, assuming
that brand recognition for a funny and appealing presenta-
tion [38] might convince operators to participate in our sur-
vey [37].
Figure 1: Questionnaire overview
Past Misconfiguration Experience. This section of our question-
naire is dedicated to security misconfigurations and experiences
that operators have with them. To collect comparable and correct
data, we define and describe what security and security misconfig-
urations are in the context of the questionnaire. The questions of
this section serve to address our observation that security miscon-
figurations appear to be a common issue in IT operations. Hence,
we record whether operators had misconfigured something before
that was security-relevant, and whether there had been an incident
because of it. Furthermore, based on our observations on the impor-
tance of blameless postmortems, we also ask if they had encountered
a security misconfiguration made by someone else.
To better understand the frequency of different types of miscon-
figurations, and to compare to the respondents’ self-reflections in
the first part of this section, we also inquire whether the operators
have encountered a specific misconfiguration or had misconfigured
a specific system themselves using examples of misconfigurations
from our qualitative study (Table 3). To supplement our qualitative
data on how misconfigurations are detected in practice, we also pro-
vide an optional free-text field.
Misconfiguration Facilitating Factors. In this part of the survey,
we ask operators to indicate how regularly they encountered the
personal, environmental and system-specific misconfiguration facili-
tating factors that we identified in our qualitative study (Section 4).
Again, we provide a free-text field to collect additional qualitative
data.

vertising the survey.
We refrained from utilizing community and “question and answer”
sites like Server Fault [41] or Super User [42] because their respec-
tive terms of service prohibit advertising or conducting surveys (do-
ing so is often perceived as intrusive by operators). In fact, although
we only advertised our survey on mailing lists for which it was al-
lowed, we occasionally received negative feedback that our study
was unsolicited. We did not trace participation in the survey to a
specific dissemination channel, as we opted to not implement user
tracking in our questionnaire due to ethical concerns.
6 QUANTITATIVE RESULTS
Participation. We published our survey on July 19, 2017 and con-
cluded it 30 days later (August 17, 2017). In total, we received 231
responses, 80 percent of which were recorded in the first 15 days.
78 participants subscribed to our mailing list for updates on our
findings. Figure 3 shows how our dissemination efforts relate to the
number of participants of the questionnaire.
Filtering. We excluded ten responses from our analysis due to
incorrect or incomplete data. For four of these ten submissions no
data was collected, potentially due to Google Forms malfunctioning.
The six other respondents stated they had never worked as opera-
tors before, two of which additionally declared that they just liked
disrupting surveys. Hence, our analysis is based on the remaining
221 current and former operators.

European organizations, other parts of the world are underrepre-
sented. However, considering the increasing internationalization,
especially in IT industries, we do not regard this as a significant
limitation. That it is not a limitation is also being highlighted by
the distribution of age and experience of participants (Figure 4(b)
and Figure 4(c)), which is similar to that of other regions, for ex-
ample, as shown by earlier studies for the U.S.-centric operations
community [29]. Concerning the level of education, our results dif-
fer: 63.8% of all respondents have at least a Bachelor’s degree, which
stands in contrast to 41.7% in the last LISA salary survey [29]. Nev-
ertheless, this difference may be due to the eased accessibility and
lower personal financial cost of higher education in Europe, pos-
sibly because of larger public financial support [43]. These consid-
erations underline that our sample is—within its limitations (Sec-
tion 8)—representative concerning the underlying strata.
Employment Situation. For the results of our survey, 89.1% of op-
erators are employees, 8.2% are self-employed, and 2.7% are former
operators. Notably, nearly half (48.9%) of all participants consider
their position to be at least partially a managerial position (e.g., as
team leaders). We also find a reasonable variety in terms of indus-
tries that the participants work in: Spanning from IT enterprises
to ISPs to government organizations and organizations that do not
operate in the IT sector, but who rely on IT to support their core
business operations.
6.1 Security Misconfiguration Frequency
Our first observation from our qualitative study is that security mis-
configurations are an (even more) common issue than reported (se-
curity) incidents indicate. Since security misconfigurations carry
a certain amount of guilt, operators may not be upfront or hon-
est when being asked about misconfigurations that they personally
created (i.e., if there are no “blameless postmortems”). Therefore,
we separated the involved responsibility domains (Section 5) and
we first asked the operators whether they had misconfigured some-
thing themselves, and then whether they had found somebody else’s
misconfiguration.
For the former self-reflective part, we also provided operators
with the option to acknowledge that they may have misconfigured
something, which they yet have to notice. We also inquired if any
of the discovered misconfigurations led to a security incident. Fur-
thermore, to also include cases for which the operators did not fully
share our understanding of a security misconfiguration, we subse-
quently presented them with a list of possible misconfigurations

based on our qualitative study. Again, we asked whether these mis-
configurations had happened to them, and/or, if they encountered
them.
From 221 operators, 170 (76.92%) acknowledge that they miscon-
figured a system and 68 (30.8%) state that at least one misconfig-
uration led to a security incident (Figure 5). Nine operators (4.1%)
state that one of their own security misconfigurations led to a se-
curity incident, contradicting their prior statements that they are
not aware of security misconfigurations that they committed in the
past. This may be explained by different notions of security miscon-
figurations. If we consider the answers to specific incidents, then
the number of operators acknowledging their own security miscon-
figurations rises to 196 (88.7%). Furthermore, when prompting for
specificmisconfigurationstheyhadencountered,onlyoneoperator
(0.5%) claims to have never encountered any of the specific miscon-
figurations we mentioned, or even encountered one in general.
Looking closer at specific types of misconfigurations (Table 3),
the average operator made more than four different kinds of mis-
configurations (4.3) and encountered more than eight (8.4). Out of
twelve presented misconfigurations, the most common self-made
9
ones are delayed or missing updates, faulty scripting, and faulty fire-
wall configuration (Figure 6). Among the encountered misconfigu-
rations, weak or default passwords, delayed or missing updates, and
faulty assignment of permissions are the most frequently selected
misconfigurations (also Figure 6). The most interesting observation
here is that, with a deviation of around 20%, the relative frequency
for self-made and encountered misconfigurations match, except for
cases that are straight-forward violations of operational best prac-
tices (weak or default authentication credentials (password), insuffi-
cientsecurityhardening,andmisusingsystems).Weconjecturethat

Discussion. Overall, close to all respondents of our survey en-
countered security sensitive misconfigurations in practice. This cor-
responds to our qualitative interviews, in which all interview part-
ners encountered misconfigurations and shared a multitude of re-
lated experiences. Nevertheless, we see a tendency of operators to
be more willing to acknowledge misconfigurations if it does not
attribute guilt to them. In line with our qualitative interviews, it
highlights the importance of blameless postmortems.Concerningmis-
configuration types, weak or default passwords, lax permissions,
and delayed (security) updates are the most frequent issues, closely
followed by insufficient and too permissive firewall rules. Interest-
ingly,thesearealsothetypesofmisconfigurationsthatareregularly
considered responsible for major data leaks [44].
6.2 Organizational Factors and Management
In our questionnaire, we asked the operators which misconfigura-
tion facilitating factors they identified for misconfigurations that
they encountered during their work. The most frequent personal
factors are a lack of knowledge (78.73%) and a lack of experience
(75.57%), which aligns with our qualitative interviews, where par-
ticipants frequently mentioned that missing experience and a lack
of knowledge are major issues.
In the context of environmental factors, the most frequent rea-
sons are sole responsibility (76.92%) and insufficient quality assur-
ance (73.30%). The general picture here is that during the qualitative
interviews,thefocuswason social issues,whileduringthequestion-
naire study organizational aspects appear to stand out. This may be
attributable to the different circumstances induced by the qualita-
tive and the quantitative methodology [45], that is, the difference is
because social issues are more likely to be voiced during the (seem-
ingly) less formal interviews rather than a survey. This may also
play a role in why the usage of defaults is the most common sys-
temic factor, while it was only infrequently mentioned during the
interviews: Respondents may not have felt comfortable to discuss
it, as it is stigmatized as a form of personal failure.
Turning toward the management, we find that operators con-
sider poor “financial decisions” and “unqualified leadership” less of
an issue than the initial qualitative interviews indicated. While our
interview partners were quite vivid about their perspective on the
quality of their leadership, only little more than a third of operators
(39.37%)seeunqualifiedleadershipasacauseforsecuritymisconfig-
urations. Similarly, less than a third of respondents (30.77%) point to
financial decisions as being a cause for security misconfigurations.
Surprisingly, operators seem to agree that their direct supervisors
understand what they do (Table 4, line 7).

However, when investigating this opinion more closely, we find
that it is impacted by an operator’s organizations’ type. Operators
from organizations without an IT background (avg. 0.534) and the
government sector (avg. 0.474) are significantly less convinced that
their superiors know what they are doing (p  0:15 in Pearson’s χ 2).
Considering results from the Opinions section of our survey (Ta-
ble 4), Statement 10 (“I trust all the tools and equipment we’re us-
ing.”) is of particular interest: Operators seem to generally distrust
the tools that they are using and need to rely on, with a global av-
erage of -0.651. In fact, it correlates with the operators’ experience.
“Younger” operators still trust their tools (< 1 year in the field, avg.
0.400), while less junior operators already start to distrust them (1-3
years operating experience, avg. 0.050). After three years of expe-
rience in the field, the disagreement rises further (3-5 years experi-
ence, avg. -0.462), and the trust only decreases over time, culminat-
ing at an average disagreement of -1.032 for operators with more
than 20 years experience. This effect is significant at p < 0:005 in
Pearson’s χ 2 and naturally co-correlates with the operators’ age.
Discussion. Based on our survey, we can assert that operators see
major obstacles for secure operations and preventing security mis-
configurations on the organizational side. We also find that the sec-
tor of an organization has an impact on the (perceived) IT aptitude
of the operators’ managers. While this might be expected, we sug-
gest that non-IT organizations take special care to offer additional
trainingforITmiddlemanagerswhoarepromotedintothisposition
from diverse backgrounds. Failing to do so could otherwise result in
an environment that facilitates misconfigurations.
Naturally, the focus of strategies to mitigate misconfigurations
should be on environmental features: Reducing sole responsibility,
introducing (more) quality assurance and automation, and, ensuring
that operators do not face unreasonable workloads. Indeed, several
personal factors, while commonly selected, may be co-dependent
on organizational factors and might be mitigated indirectly by ad-
dressing these organizational factors. For example, a lack of knowl-
edge or experience can be mitigated by reducing sole responsibility
and a four-eye policy, especially for sensitive or security-relevant
changes and junior operators.
The increasingly dwindling trust of operators in their tools over
the course of their careers is also an important matter that needs to
be addressed. We conjecture that it is a symptom of getting contin-
uously frustrated with tools not living up to their expectations and
promises. Unfortunately, this increasing distrust and reluctance can
have negative effects on the deployment of mitigations: If operators
do not trust them, then they might not (correctly) deploy them in
the first place, or they might try to find ways around them. In fact,
this effect corresponds to fundamental conclusions that analyzes of
decades of devastating incidents in safety science have made [46].
