Abstract—A parked domain is an undeveloped domain which
has no content other than automatically computed advertising
banners and links, used to generate proﬁt. Despite the apparent
popularity of this practice, little is known about parked domains
and domain parking services that assist domain owners in parking
and monetizing unused domains.
This paper presents and in-depth exploration of the ecosystem
of domain parking services from a security point of view, focusing
mostly on the consequences for everyday users who land on
parked pages. By collecting data from over 8 million parked
domains, we are able to map out the entities that constitute
the ecosystem, thus allowing us to analyze the domain owners,
parking services, and advertisement syndicators involved. We
show that users who land on parked websites are exposed to
malware, inappropriate content, and elaborate scams, such as
fake antivirus warnings and costly remote “technicians”. At the
same time, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant number of parked domains to be
abusing popular names and trademarks through typosquatting
and through domain names confusingly similar to authoritative
ones.
Given the extent of observed abuse, we propose a set of
features that are representative of parked pages and build a
robust client-side classiﬁer which achieves high accuracy with
a negligible percentage of false positives.

INTRODUCTION
Up until twenty years ago, domain names were available
for free on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve basis. Network Solutions,
the company that was contracted by the US Defense Infor-
mation Systems Agency to operate the DNS registry, was
imposing at the time a one domain for each person/company
limitation. Because of the high demand, in 1995, Network So-
lutions switched to a paying model which has been preserved
till today.
Apart from the rapid expansion of the web due to the
fact that every person and company desired to have an online
presence, the high demand for domain names was also due to
people buying large amounts of domains in bulk and creating

domain portfolios. These people, later called “domainers”, had
no interest in setting up companies and using their purchased
domains. They had, instead, realized that domains would soon
become a very valuable commodity. As such, they bought
hundreds or thousands of domains under the premise that
real companies would later pay them a large amount of
money in exchange for a desirable domain from their extensive
portfolios. Popular successful examples of this strategy include
domains like wine.com and casino.com both sold for millions
of dollars. Even with the advent of new Top Level Domains
(TLDs), short and generic domains are still occasionally sold
for exorbitant prices [32].
Initially, the owners of large domain portfolios did little
more than wait until an interested buyer contacted them for
one of their domains. Eventually, some people realized that
instead of just idly waiting, domain portfolios could be put
to better use. These people struck deals with other websites
and included banners and “favorite links” for a ﬂat monthly
fee [22]. At the same time, however, a new type of advertising
started appearing on the web, namely, Pay-Per-Click adver-
tising. As the name implies, in this new scheme, a publisher
would only get paid by the advertiser if a user would click on
one of the ads.
Undeveloped domains were a natural ﬁt for this type of ads.
Services started appearing that made it easy for domain owners
to incorporate ads on their domains without worrying about
ﬁnding advertisers and setting up contracts. These services
were called domain parking services, since domain owners
would simply “park” their domains at these service providers,
and then the rest would be done automatically. Domain parking
was so successful
that owners of large domain portfolios
stopped worrying about selling their domains and instead
started making proﬁt simply because of the commission they
got from the ads that were clicked [22].
Despite of the popularity of the domain parking phe-
nomenon, domain parking services have received little atten-
tion from the security community. Up until recently, these
services were only mentioned in papers studying cybersquat-
ting, showing that domain parking is, by far, the most popular
monetization strategy for cybersquatters [12], [20], [25], [27],
[28], [30], [31]. In recent research, Alrwais et al. studied
domain parking from the point of view of advertisers and
domain owners [15]. They showed that the majority of do-
main parking companies employ shady practices, such as,
hiding clicks from domain owners (thereby not sharing click
commissions), conducting click fraud, and sending unrelated
trafﬁc to advertisers who pay for trafﬁc with very speciﬁc
demographics.
In this paper, we study domain parking services mainly
from the point of view of everyday web users and thus orthogo-
nally to the work of Alrwais et al. [15]. We identify 15 popular
parking services and retrieve a corpus of more than 8 million
parked domains. Through a series of automatic and manual
experiments, we identify the presence of a wide range of
fraud and abuse, targeting users as well as companies. Among
others, we show that typical users landing on parked pages
are exposed to inappropriate ads, malware, elaborate scams
involving “technicians” getting access to a user’s machine and
scripts that detect and bypass advertising blockers. We also
challenge the stance of the most popular ad syndicator who
provides the domain parking ecosystem with the necessary
advertising infrastructure, while at the same time telling its
users that parked pages are spam and are thus hidden from
that syndicator’s search engine.
Given the extent of the discovered abuse, we design and
build a robust classiﬁer for detecting parked domains which
does not rely on hard coded signatures but on distinguishing
features of parked domains with a true-positive rate of 97.9%
and a false-positive rate of only 0.5%. This classiﬁer can
be straightforwardly incorporated in a browser through its
extension system, and alert users whenever they land on a
parked domain.
Our main contributions are:
• We perform the ﬁrst thorough study of domain parking
services, mapping out
the entire ecosystem while
focusing on the abuse affecting everyday web users.
• We show that parked pages expose the user to a series
of dangers including malware, scams and inappropri-
ate content
• We verify the presence of an unacceptably large
number of typosquatting domains parked with popular
domain parking services, and demonstrate the lack
of control when it comes to parking an obviously
typosquatting domain
• We propose a performant classiﬁer
for detecting
parked pages, utilizing robust features that are telling
of a website’s nature

Section II describes the ecosystem of the domain parking
industry. In Section III, we analyze the domains parked with
these services and we study several of their abusive practices.
Afterwards, Section IV details how we designed a classiﬁer to
detect parked pages. Thereafter, the observations and results of
the paper are further discussed in Section V, followed by an
overview of the related work in Section VI. Lastly, the paper
concludes in Section VII.
II. DOMAIN PARKING ECOSYSTEM
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the modus operandi of
domain parking services and the various entities involved in
the domain parking ecosystem. We then report on the discovery
of 8 million parked domains, hosted with 15 different parking

services,
to identify how domain parking is
used today and the extent of abuse in terms of trademark
infringements, typosquatting and malicious redirections.
A. What is Domain Parking?
The ecosystem of domain parking consists of four different
parties: domain owners, parking services, advertisement syndi-
cators, and advertisers. Domain owners (or domainers) usually
own a large portfolio of undeveloped domain names, which
they wish to monetize. As long as the monetization strategy
returns more money than the cost of owning and managing a
domain portfolio, this strategy probably is ﬁnancially attrac-
tive.
Parking services provide hosting and generated content for
domain owners who wish to monetize their domain names. As
the name suggests, the domain owners “park” their domain
names with domain parking services who then manage these
domains and,
in return, give the domain owners a share
of their proﬁts. Parking services typically collaborate with
advertisement syndicators to serve purportedly relevant pay-
per-click (PPC) ads from one of their advertising clients.
The operation model of domain parking is depicted in
Figure 1. When a domain owner selects a service to park his
domains, he conﬁgures the DNS settings of the domains to
use the name servers of that parking service (1). When a web
user later visits that domain, a parking page is displayed with
content that is dynamically generated by the parking service. In
addition, the parking service includes JavaScript code from an
ad syndicator on the parked page. The syndicator’s code will
attempt to fetch and display ads from a plethora of advertisers,
based on relevant keywords derived from the domain name (2).
For example, if a user visits the parked domain cheapgas.com
the parked page eventually displays ads that, in principle, are
relevant to “cheap gas.” If a user clicks on one of these ads,
he will be sent to the respective advertiser’s website, through
the syndicator’s tracking and redirection mechanisms (3). The
advertiser will pay the syndicator for the visitor, who, in turn,
will pay the parking service for the delivered click. Finally,
the domain owner is given his share for supplying the domain
on which the click was generated (4).
B. How do users end up on parked domains?
A detail that is missing from the above description is the
process through which users end up on parked domains. Since
parked services take, by deﬁnition, advantage of undeveloped
domain names, it is unlikely that a user landed on a parked
page by ﬁnding and following a link in a search engine, or
on a trustworthy domain. As such, users end up on parked
domains through alternative means.
While today’s search engines are tightly coupled in a user’s
browser (either in a dedicated text ﬁeld next to the address
bar, or piggybacking on the address bar itself) that was not
always the case. In the past, a user would have to either know
about a speciﬁc domain name, or explicitly visit the website
of a search engine and search for relevant content. During that
time, browsing the web involved signiﬁcantly more typing of
domain names in a browser’s URL bar than it does today.
For known sites, users would typically need to memorize
the domain name of a website and manually type it, in full,

possession of parked domains.
The percentage of distinct owners and their cumulative share in
parked domains from the 15 observed parking services. Since
the DNS Census is outdated (and likely incomplete),
this
means that at the time of this writing, there exist at least 8
million domains whose sole purpose is to serve ads when they
are visited.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the gathered domains
with each service. One can quickly notice that even though
many parking services exist, only a handful of them are
responsible for managing the majority of parked domains. That
is, 60% of the discovered domains are parked with the three
most popular services: Sedo Parking, Internet Trafﬁc and Cash
Parking.
III. ANALYSIS OF PARKED DOMAINS
In this section we study several characteristics and practices
of parked domains. We start by inspecting the 8 million
gathered domain names and map out their typosquatting abuse.
Next, we randomly sample several thousand parked domains
which we crawl automatically using PhantomJS [7], an in-
strumented browser, while saving the HTML of every loaded
frame, logging all HTTP requests and taking a screenshot.
Furthermore, we collected WHOIS data for these domains.
This data is then used to map out advertising networks, domain
owners, trademark abuse, malicious redirects and ad-blocker
detection mechanisms.
A. Parked Domain Owners
To get an understanding of parked domain ownership,
we request WHOIS data for 3000 randomly-selected parked
domains. We parse the WHOIS records using Ruby Whois [18]
and ﬁlter out the records that are anonymized or unparseable.
From the remaining 1,582 domains, we extract the registrant,
administrator, and technical contact details and group together
the domains that
the same name, email address and
organization. As a ﬁnal step, we manually merge clusters of
domains for which we are certain belong to the same individual
or organization. In total, we ﬁnd 910 distinct domain owners
to which the 1,582 domains belong. Figure 3, shows that a
small number of them is responsible for the majority of parked
domains. For instance, 50% of domains is owned by 15.6%
(142) of owners. This means that next to owners who posses
list
a couple of domains and use domain parking services, there
are individuals with very large collections of domains, all of
which are registered to simply serve ads.
B. Advertisement Syndicators
Advertising is the lifeblood of domain parking services.
In order to generate revenue from parked domains, parking
services usually serve pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements to
visitors. Every time that a user clicks on an advertisement
situated on a parked page, both the domain owner, as well as
the domain parking service itself are paid a small commission.
While a domain parking service could, in principle, directly
accept ads from people who wish to advertise their products
and services and then display them on their own parked
pages, it is easier and more scalable for them to use existing
advertising infrastructure of third-party ad syndicators.
The integration of these syndicators involves little more
than the inclusion of remote JavaScript
libraries from the
servers of the syndicator. These libraries are responsible for
assessing the content of the page, fetch and display ads from
other third-party servers, deliver the user who clicks on an ad
to the advertiser who paid for that ad and register that action
so that the publishing site (in this case the domain parking
service) can receive the appropriate commission.
In search for these syndicators, we sampled 3,000 parked
domains, crawled them, and inspected their source code for
ad-related remote JavaScript inclusions. In total, we found
only four advertisement syndicators that provided ad-related
JavaScript code, Adsense, Doubleclick, Media.net and Chango,
as shown in Figure 4. Their aggregate presence reaches
91%±1% of the parked websites. The other 9%±1% were
either redirects (7%±0.9%) (described later in Section III-F)
or had no identiﬁable advertising code (2%±0.05%). Since
domain parking services depend on advertising, we assume
that the latter was due to some temporal server-side miscon-
ﬁguration.
Doubleclick and Adsense, both Google products, were
present in 90%±1.1% and 88%±1.2% of parked websites
respectively. While, given the ubiquitous nature of Google
