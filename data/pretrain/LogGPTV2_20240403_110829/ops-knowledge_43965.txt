User: I'm new to this and trying to deploy a first app to the app engine. However, when i try to i get this message:
"This application does not exist (app_id=u'udacity')."
I fear it might have to do with the app.yaml file so i'll just leave here what i have there:
application: udacity
version: 1
runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: yes
handlers:
- url: /favicon.ico
  static_files: favicon.ico
  upload: favicon.ico

url: /.*
script: main.app

libraries:
- name: webapp2
  version: "2.5.2"
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: create the project in your google app engine account by specifiying the 
Application identifier and title(say you have given your application identifier 
is=helloworld)
Go to the google app engine launcher and match your project name in the 
app.yaml 
with the name identifier you created in your google app engine account and then deploy it.
