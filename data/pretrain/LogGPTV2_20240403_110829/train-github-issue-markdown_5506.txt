  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
using:
  * `zeit/next-sass` for my `next.config.js`
  * a custom `server.js` with a custom directory 
    * `const application = next({ dev, dir: './src' });`
  * Flow js for type checking
  * Redux and Apollo
I have just updated to next 6.0.0 and I can't use my site because the HMR
fails to find any information, causing any route requests to result in a full
reload.
The site works when loaded with `yarn build && yarn start`
Folder structures:
    ./src
      /pages
        /apps
          /Public
            index.js
            sign_in.js
            sign_up.js
            forgot_password.js
          /Admin
            .......
# EDIT:
It seems like the files are supposed to go directly into `.next` I see that
happening in a small test repo that I made. However, it now seems that if
that's the case, the error I'm encountering is actually the fact that the HMR
is unable to find the `hot-update.json` files when updates are made.
# END EDIT
* * *
When on page `/apps/Public/sign_in` as `/sign_in` I click on ``
Result:

Initial page loads of all pages works perfectly. However, any route changes
fail.
## Debugging
I have tried just about everything I can think of. It seems like this error is
caused from my `./src/.next` file not having a `/webpack` directory. My
understanding is that HMR will look for the `hot-update.json` files in
`/webpack`
However, in my case, all `hot-update.json` files are in `./src/.next`

### Contents of `./src/.next`

## Questions:
  * Why do I not have a `/webpack` directory?
  * I can't create a reproduction repo, can someone from Zeit help by looking through my private repo?
