Parameters
Parameter
Description
publishscp /directory:
Required. Specifies the DNS name of the TAPI application directory partition that the service connection point will publish.
/domain: 
Specifies the DNS name of the domain in which the service connection point is created. If the domain name is not specified, the name of the local domain is used.
/forcedefault
Specifies that this directory is the default TAPI application directory partition for the domain. There can be multiple TAPI application directory partitions in a domain.
/?
Displays help at the command prompt.
/directory:
Remarks
This command-line tool can be run on any computer that is a member of the domain.
User-supplied text (such as the names of TAPI application directory partitions, servers, and domains) with International or Unicode characters are only displayed correctly if appropriate fonts and language support are installed.
You can still use Internet Locator Service (ILS) servers in your organization, if ILS is needed to support certain applications, because TAPI clients running Windows XP or a Windows Server 2003 operating system can query either ILS servers or TAPI application directory partitions.
You can use tapicfg to create or remove service connection points. If the TAPI application directory partition is renamed for any reason (for example, if you rename the domain in which it resides), you must remove the existing service connection point and create a new one that contains the new DNS name of the TAPI application directory partition to be published. Otherwise, TAPI clients are unable to locate and access the TAPI application directory partition. You can also remove a service connection point for maintenance or security purposes (for example, if you do not want to expose TAPI data on a specific TAPI application directory partition).
