### `tapicfg publishscp`

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `tapicfg publishscp` command creates a service connection point (SCP) to publish a TAPI application directory partition. This SCP enables TAPI clients to locate and access the specified TAPI application directory partition.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
tapicfg publishscp /directory:<DNS_name> [/domain:<DNS_name>] [/forcedefault] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/directory:** (Required)
  - Specifies the DNS name of the TAPI application directory partition that the service connection point will publish.
  
- **/domain:**
  - Specifies the DNS name of the domain in which the service connection point is created. If this parameter is not provided, the local domain's name is used by default.
  
- **/forcedefault:**
  - Marks the specified directory as the default TAPI application directory partition for the domain. Multiple TAPI application directory partitions can exist within a single domain, but only one can be designated as the default.
  
- **/?**
  - Displays help information for the command at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**

- This command-line tool can be executed on any computer that is a member of the domain.
- User-supplied text, such as names of TAPI application directory partitions, servers, and domains, with international or Unicode characters, will only be displayed correctly if the appropriate fonts and language support are installed.
- You can continue to use Internet Locator Service (ILS) servers in your organization if ILS is required to support specific applications. TAPI clients running Windows XP or a Windows Server 2003 operating system can query either ILS servers or TAPI application directory partitions.
- Use `tapicfg` to create or remove service connection points. If the TAPI application directory partition is renamed (e.g., due to a domain rename), you must remove the existing service connection point and create a new one with the updated DNS name. Failing to do so will prevent TAPI clients from locating and accessing the TAPI application directory partition.
- You can also remove a service connection point for maintenance or security reasons, such as when you do not want to expose TAPI data on a specific TAPI application directory partition.
