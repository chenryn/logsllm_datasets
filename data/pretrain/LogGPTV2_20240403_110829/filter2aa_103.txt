SITCH
Inexpensive, coordinated GSM anomaly detection
About Me
• 2000: Technology career started (I can get paid for 
this??) 
• 2003: Started building with Linux 
• Came to infosec through systems and network 
engineering, integration 
• Security tools and integration (SIEM, HIDS, etc…) 
• Current: R&D
About You
• Background in systems and network engineering 
• Interested in GSM threat detection 
• Tinfoil hat not required… but not unwelcome!

What We’re Covering Today
• Why Care? 
• Current Threat and Detection Landscape 
• Project Goals 
• SITCH: MkI 
• SITCH: MkII 
• Service Architecture 
• Future Plans 
• Prior Art 
• Q&A
Why Care?
• Invasions of privacy are bad, even when 
they’re unnoticed. 
• Industrial espionage costs money and jobs.
WTF Is Under All That??
Is Anybody Home?
Terminology
• Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR): Using software to perform signal 
processing in concert with an adjustable-frequency RF receiver 
• ARFCN: Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number 
• BTS: Base Transceiver Station 
• CGI: Cell Global ID (MCC + MNC + LAC + CI) 
• MCC: Mobile Country Code 
• MNC: Mobile Network Code 
• LAC: Location Area Code 
• CI: Cell ID 
• IMSI: International Mobile Subscriber Identity
GSM Addressing
Threat and Detection Landscape
• Malicious Devices 
• Indicators of Attack 
• Existing Detection Methods
Hacked 
Femtocell
Trusted part of provider’s 
network 
Your phone doesn’t know 
it’s evil
Evil BTS
Handset will automatically 
associate, unable to 
assert trustworthiness
Indicators of Attack
• ARFCN over threshold 
• ARFCN outside forecast 
• Unrecognized CGI 
• Gratuitous BTS re-association 
• BTS detected outside of range
Detection Methods
• Commercial Options: 
• Pwnie Express 
• Bastille Networks 
• Open Source: 
• Fake BTS 
• AIMSICD 
• Femto Catcher
Project Goals
• Inexpensive (what can I get for $100?) 
• Small footprint, low power requirements 
preferred 
• Functional Targets: Indicators of Attack (IOA) 
Coverage 
• Centrally managed software and 
conﬁguration
