Often I use some type of tabs widget on websites but usually on very small
viewports (usually always around iphone portrait 320-380px range) it always
ends up looking terrible since the tabs need to wrap on two lines and it just
never looks good.
Recently my solution has been to create a custom tab widget that when hitting
a certain breakpoint will automatically change itself to show as an accordion
widget. Accordions seem like a perfect substitute for tabs on these small
viewports and would be a nice touch for making more of your widgets even more
mobile friendly.
