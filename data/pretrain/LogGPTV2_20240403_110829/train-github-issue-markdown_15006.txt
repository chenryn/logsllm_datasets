When designing for very small viewports, such as those on iPhones in portrait mode (typically 320-380px), I often find that traditional tab widgets do not scale well. The tabs frequently wrap onto multiple lines, which can make the interface look cluttered and unappealing.

To address this issue, I have developed a custom tab widget that automatically transforms into an accordion at a specific breakpoint. This solution is particularly effective because accordions are more suitable for displaying content on small screens. They allow for a cleaner, more organized layout, enhancing the overall user experience and making the design more mobile-friendly.
