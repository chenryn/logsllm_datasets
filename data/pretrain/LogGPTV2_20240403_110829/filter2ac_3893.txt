**Title: Botconf2022 TA410: A Distant Cousin of APT10**

TA410 is a cyber-espionage group that was first identified in August 2019 by researchers at Proofpoint. This threat actor exhibits notable technical capabilities, including the use of sophisticated implants. However, it has not garnered the same level of attention from the threat intelligence community as other major Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups.

While TA410's activities share some similarities with past operations attributed to APT10, such as the use of similar VBA macros, these commonalities are insufficient to conclusively link the two as a single entity. Consequently, some public reports have incorrectly attributed TA410's activities to APT10.

In this presentation, we will provide a detailed overview of TA410, highlighting its distinct characteristics and operational differences from the current activities of APT10.
