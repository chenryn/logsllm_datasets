### 8. Future Work

#### Resiliency
The tools and methods we have developed for inferring regional topologies offer a new approach to studying resilience across space and time. The observed topological differences across various regions have significant implications for disaster resilience. A promising future direction is to integrate these topologies with existing or future datasets on the resilience of connectivity, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of network robustness.

#### Edge Computing
Understanding the topology of regional access networks and their performance implications is crucial for realizing the full potential of edge computing [28, 59]. Our discovery of the pyramid structure in Edge CO and Agg CO topologies, combined with latency measurements, indicates that Agg COs are typically within 10 milliseconds of both the cloud and customers in the region, meeting the AR/VR latency requirements for edge computing [47]. This suggests that deploying edge computing infrastructure in Agg COs is the most efficient solution. Additionally, efforts to offload computation from mobile devices [40] can benefit from an understanding of the impact of distributed Edge COs on latency to the cloud.

#### Scalability of Measurement Methods
There is significant potential for improving the scalability and manageability of our measurement methods. For the AT&T study, we manually collected traceroutes by driving to each McDonald’s location in San Diego and connecting to their WiFi. While this was a valuable experience, operationalizing such a measurement would require crowd-sourcing. We propose developing an app that connects to public WiFi spots (e.g., while users wait for their food orders) and provides a reward for uploading results.

We also envision ways to enhance the scalability of ShipTraceroute. Besides sending more cellular packets in parallel to save energy, we can optimize the device's sleep cycles between measurements. During cross-country shipments, the device often stops at hubs for about a day. By using the device’s accelerometer, we can pause measurements when it is at rest, thus conserving energy and extending battery life.

### 9. Conclusion

We have conducted a comprehensive measurement study of the topology of U.S. regional access ISPs. Our goal was to extract insights into the architectural choices made by ISPs for traffic aggregation and to empirically assess the implications of these choices for the resilience and evolution of the Internet ecosystem. The growing interest in edge computing, 5G co-location, and the pandemic-induced shift to remote work is placing increasing pressure on these regional networks. As we become more dependent on this infrastructure, there has been little independent, objective analysis of its resilience and reliability.

This lack of attention is understandable, as these networks are not easily amenable to straightforward measurement and analysis. Despite the limitations of our tools, we were able to create surprisingly accurate maps despite considerable noise in our input signals, such as missing or incorrect DNS or traceroute hops. We identified various approaches to provisioning redundancy across links, nodes, buildings, and different levels of the hierarchy. These measurements provide a foundation for reasoning about the sources of performance and reliability impairment in these networks. We believe that sharing our methods, lessons, and results will inform future analyses of critical infrastructure.
