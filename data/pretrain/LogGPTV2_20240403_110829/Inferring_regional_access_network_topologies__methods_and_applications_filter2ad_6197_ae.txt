8 FUTURE WORK
Resiliency. The tools and methods we have developed for inferring
regional topologies enable a new approach to studying resilience
across space and time. The topological differences that we have
already observed across different regions have strong implications
for resilience against disasters. A promising next direction is to com-
bine these topologies with existing or future data sets on resilience
of connectivity.
Edge Computing. Understanding the topology of these regional
access networks, and associated performance implications, may be
the key to realizing the unachieved potential of the long-hyped
edge computing paradigm [28, 59]. In addition to discovering the
pyramid structure of the Edge CO and Agg CO topologies, our
latency measurements suggest that the AggCO is typically less than
10 msecs from both the cloud and customers in the region, which
meets the AR/VR latency requirement for edge computing [47]. This
result suggests that putting edge computing infrastructure in Agg
COs is the most efficient solution. Efforts to offload computation
from mobile devices [40] can also leverage an understanding of the
effect of distributed EdgeCOs on latency to the cloud.
Scalability of measurement methods. There is opportunity for
improving scalability and manageability of our methods. For the
AT&T study, we drove to each McDonald’s location in San Diego,
connected to their WiFi, and collected traceroutes. This approach
is a fun adventure for a graduate student, but operationalizing such
a measurement requires crowd sourcing. We could develop an app
that connects to public WiFi spots (while the user waits for their
food order), and provides a reward for uploaded results.
We also envision ways to improve the scalability of ShipTracer-
oute. Besides sending more cellular packets in parallel to save en-
ergy, we can arrange for the device to sleep even more between
measurements. During a cross-country shipment, a device often
stops at a hub for about a day. We could use the device’s accelerom-
eter to pause measurements when the device is at rest.
9 CONCLUSION
We have undertaken a comprehensive measurement study of the
topology of U.S. regional access ISPs. Our motivation was to ex-
tract insights about architectural choices that ISPs make for how to
aggregate traffic, and then empirically assess implications of those
insights for the resilience and evolution of the Internet ecosystem.
Growing interest in edge computing and 5G co-location, not to
mention the pandemic-induced semi-permanent transition to work-
ing from home, is placing increasing pressure on these regional
networks. We are now entirely dependent on this infrastructure
but there has been little attention to independent objective under-
standing of its resilience and reliability.
This dearth of attention is understandable. While perhaps not the
most opaque part of the Internet, these networks are not amenable
to straightforward measurement and analysis. Our tools have their
limitations, but they allowed us to make surprisingly accurate maps
in spite of considerable noise in our input signals, e.g., missing
or incorrect DNS or traceroute hops. We were able to identify
many different approaches to provisioning redundancy, across links,
nodes, buildings, and at different levels of the hierarchy. These
measurements can provide a basis for reasoning about sources
of performance and reliability impairment in these networks. We
believe that sharing our methods, lessons, and results will inform
future analysis of critical infrastructure.
