Current`tf.data.dataset`class only support `padded_batch` method which would
pad every component into same shape, but there are cases that some component
may not be padable, e.g., in object detection input pipeline, the ground truth
calsses and bounding boxes are different for different image, so they can not
be padded to the same shape as images, so how to batch these data in this
case?
