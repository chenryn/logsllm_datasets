User: How to execute a thread in a script in a new terminal window/command prompt? So that the results of the thread will be displayed on a separate window while still having control on the main interpreter? The thread is a continuous remote server pinging thread for alive check.
Assistant: The -S option of xterm can be used to pass a PTY slave file descriptor. Data written to the corresponding PTY master should then appear in the xterm window.
So in your thread, you could call os.openpty() to open a new PTY, start an xterm with subprocess.Popen(), passing a suitable -S option, and write all thread's output to the PTY master fd.
I tried this on Linux but couldn't get any output on the xterm. Googling around suggests a bug in xterm, as this is a rarely used feature. Or maybe you can figure out how to do it correctly :)
