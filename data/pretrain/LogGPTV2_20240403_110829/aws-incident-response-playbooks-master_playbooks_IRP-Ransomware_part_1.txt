# Incident Response Playbook Template
### Incident Type
Ransomware
### Introduction
This playbook is provided as a template to customers using AWS products and who are building their incident response capability.  You should customize this template to suit your particular needs, risks, available tools and work processes.
Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between you and AWS. AWS is responsible for “Security of the Cloud”, while you are responsible for “Security in the Cloud”. For more information on the shared responsibility model, [please review our documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).
You are responsible for making your own independent assessment of the information in this document. This document: (a) is for informational purposes only, (b) references current AWS product offerings and practices, which are subject to change without notice, and (c) does not create any commitments or assurances from AWS and its affiliates, suppliers or licensors. This document is provided “as is” without warranties, representations, or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied. The responsibilities and liabilities of AWS to its customers are controlled by AWS agreements, and this document is not part of, nor does it modify, any agreement between AWS and its customers.
## Summary
### This Playbook
This playbook outlines response steps for handling ransomware incidents.  These steps are based on the [NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) (Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2) that can be used to:
•	Gather evidence
•	Contain and then eradicate the incident
•	recover from the incident
•	Conduct post-incident activities, including post-mortem and feedback processes
Interested readers may also refer to the [AWS Security Incident Response Guide]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/welcome.html) which contains additional resources.  
Once you have customized this playbook to meet your needs, it is important that you test the playbook (e.g., Game Days) and any automation (functional tests), update as necessary to achieve the desired results, and then publish to your knowledge management system and train all responders.
Note that some of the incident response steps noted below may incur costs in your AWS account(s) for services used in either preparing for, or responding to incidents. Customizing this playbook and testing it will help you to determine if additional costs will be incurred. You can use [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) and look at costs incurred over a particular time frame (such as when running Game Days) to establish what the possible impact might be.
In reviewing this playbook, you will find steps that involve processes that you may not have in place today. Proactively preparing for incidents means you need the right resource configurations, tools and services in place that allow you to respond to an incident.
The next section will provide a summary of this incident type, and then cover the five steps (parts 1 - 5) for handling ransomware incidents.
## This Incident Type
Ransomware is malicious code designed by threat actors to gain unauthorized access to systems and data and to encrypt the data to block access by legitimate users. Once ransomware has locked users out of their systems and/or encrypted their sensitive data, the actors demand a ransom. In theory, if the ransom is paid, access to the data is returned (such as by providing an encryption key), but equally, some studies have suggested the victim will subsequently be attacked again. Alternatively, if not paid, the organization risks permanent data loss and/or data leaks to the public, competitors or other malicious actors.
There are usually limited options to mitigate a successful ransomware attack once it has occurred.  The best mitigation is to reduce the chance that it can happen in the first place. The AWS Well-Architected security pillar provides a framework to implement AWS best practice, including operating workloads security (security foundations section), protecting compute resources (infrastructure protection section) and others. The security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. This playbook covers steps that can be used to deal with ransomware.
## Incident Response Process
---
### Part 1: Acquire, Preserve, Document Evidence
1.  You become aware that a possible ransomware incident has occurred. This information could come via different means, depending on your configurations in your AWS environment:
1.	A colleague reports that an EC2 instance cannot be accessed by SSH or similar, however the instance appears to be correctly configured with appropriate network access in place, and there are no related service issues reported by AWS in the Service Health Dashboard
2.	Your ticketing system creates a ticket for unusual metrics or logs from the EC2 instance
3.	The instance is reporting network reachability issues in the AWS console, or via Amazon CloudWatch alarms
4.	Message from threat actor through alternate communication channel such as email about the ransom demand
5.	Findings through services like AWS Security Hub or Amazon GuardDuty.
6.	Other alarms or metrics you have configured in your monitoring systems, either internal or external to AWS
2. Once you confirm that an event is a security incident, it is important to determine the scope of impact (quantity of resources as well as sensitivity of data).
1.	Determine if there are any known events that could be causing service disruption, or impacting instance metrics (e.g., network CloudWatch metrics increasing due to a sales event, or similar)
2.	Use Amazon Detective to investigate any ongoing activity using the time based analysis or a specific period when the incident was identified to identify any deviations from a “normal” operating baseline.
3.	Obtain the application’s documented baseline and locate the metrics for standard application performance from the CloudWatch or other application performances monitoring tool used in the organization to compare baseline behavior to anomalous behavior as a result of the incident.
4.	Determine the classification level of any data that resides in the EC2 instance, S3 bucket, Amazon Workspaces instance, etc.
5.	Confirm a ticket/case has been raised for the incident. If not, manually raise one.
6.	If you received an abuse notification from AWS, determine if any cases are already open for the resource that can be correlated to the abuse notification. This may provide indications relating to prior unauthorized activity.
7.	If there is a ticket/case already opened, determine what internal alarms/metrics are currently indicating an issue (if automated, what caused the ticket to be created?) If the ticket/case creation was not initiated automatically by an alarm or metric, document the alert/notification that led to identification of the issue if there was one (for example, a ransom demand popping up on the screen, or metrics that indicate the device is no longer on the network). If the incident was identified by an indicator that does not conclusively identify a ransomware incident as the cause, then verify the service disruption is not due to any planned (or other) event and document the actual vector.
8.	Identifying the ransomware strain is key to recovery. For example, if objects in S3 buckets are inaccessible with an error of not having encryption key access, the first step would be to review the S3 object properties section to understand the encryption key applied. A similar approach can be leveraged with the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)volumes in situations involving crypto ransomware.
9.	Using your preferred monitoring tool, access AWS CloudTrail and search for any API actions which indicates any credential compromise attack vector and refer to the playbook, “Credential Leakage/Compromise”.
10.	Determine when the infection occurred using log search. CloudWatch can help you to review logs such as application logs, operating system logs, database logs, etc.
11.	Determine the business impact:                                                                                                                                          
a.	Identify application(s) impacted; this may be achieved via Resource Tags, or by an internal Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
