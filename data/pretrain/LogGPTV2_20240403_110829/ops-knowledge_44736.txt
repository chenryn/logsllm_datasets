I am new to Google App Engine and Python. I have developed a Python application using Google App Engine. Previously, I was able to update my live code by running the command `appcfg.py update myapp/` from the command prompt. However, this command has suddenly stopped working as expected. Now, every time I run the command, it opens the `appcfg.py` file instead of executing it. Could you please help me understand what might be causing this issue?

**Assistant:**
Try running the command with the Python interpreter explicitly, like so: `python appcfg.py update myapp/`. This should ensure that the script is executed rather than opened in a text editor.
