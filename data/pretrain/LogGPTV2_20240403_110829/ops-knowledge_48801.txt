**Log Analysis and Solution**

**Log Entry:**
```
2015-10-18 18:01:48,963 INFO [main] org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster: Kind: YARN_AM_RM_TOKEN, Service: , Ident: (appAttemptId { application_id { id: 20 cluster_timestamp: 1445144423722 } attemptId: 1 } keyId: -127633188)
```

**Analysis:**
- **Exception Detected:** No
- **Description:** The log entry indicates that the MRAppMaster (MapReduce Application Master) for a specific application has successfully obtained a `YARN_AM_RM_TOKEN`. This token is used to authorize and authenticate the MRAppMaster, allowing it to interact with the ResourceManager and access necessary resources.
- **Application Details:**
  - **Application ID:** 20
  - **Cluster Timestamp:** 1445144423722
  - **Attempt ID:** 1
  - **Key ID:** -127633188

**Conclusion:**
The log does not indicate any errors or abnormal conditions. The MRAppMaster has successfully acquired the required authentication token, which is a normal part of the initialization process. Therefore, no further action is needed.

**Recommendation:**
- Continue monitoring the application's logs to ensure that subsequent steps in the job execution proceed as expected.
- If any issues arise later, refer to the logs for more detailed information and troubleshooting.
