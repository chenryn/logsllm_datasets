User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题cant perform upgrade from server 2008 standard to enterprise I have an 32bit Windows server 2008 standard installation which I would like to upgrade to enterprise. Its a non R2 version.

The installation is Dutch. I'm using a Dutch setup disk as well (and the same Service Pack)

It basically says: upgrades are disabled. Windows can not perform an upgrade

I can't find any logs as well.

What gives?

Assistant: When I've seen this issue, it's been because the Microsoft Action Pack Media has issues with the upgrade process.  Download the ISO from here and the upgrade should work.  I've tested it in Hyper-V and it worked.  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=5023
