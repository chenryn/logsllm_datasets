ABSTRACT
Provdng securty has become more and more urgent and
necessary n embedded systems. To support
the functonalty
securty n embedded systems, the ssues of the cost of executng
the cryptographc algorthms and flexblty concerns must be
solved. In the paper, we focus on the three most commonly used
cryptographc algorthms, AES, DES and RSA to desgn a
reconfgurable hardware for acceleratng the executng the three
algorthms. The reconfgurable hardware can be swtched ts
behavors by the control of confguraton contexts to execute the
functons of cryptographc algorthms. We frst analyze the
operaton of the three cryptographc algorthms and classfed
them nto three categores. The three modules, permutaton and
combnaton unt, computaton unt and memory unt, are then
desgned for processng the three categores of functons. The
computaton s the man processng module n ths archtecture
and s conssted of many processng elements. In order to desgn
a better processng element for the cost effectvely, we desgn
four canddates for the desgn of the processng elements and
evaluate them by usng the benchmark. A cost functon s also
defned to analyze space-tme product of the reconfgurable
hardware compared wth the ASIC desgn. The expermental
result ndcates the reconfgurable hardware only use the cost of
% compared wth the ASIC desgn wth the same benchmark.
Furthermore, f we take off the nternal SRAM n both desgn
and use
the
reconfgurable desgn has the cost of only 0% compared wth
the ASIC desgn.

the
stronger computng power and the more mpeccable development
of mathematcal technques have make cryptosystems extremely
sophstcated. As a result, embedded systems adapt some securty
features s necessary and possble.
A typcal securty protocol standard usually allows for a wde
range of cryptographc algorthms.
In general, asymmetrc
cryptographc algorthms are used to exchange the keys needed
by symmetrc ones.
If we use ASIC to speed up the two
cryptographc algorthms ndvdually, hardware utlzaton wll
be very low. The low utlzaton comes from usng symmetrc and
asymmetrc ASIC n sequence. When we use asymmetrc
cryptographc algorthms to exchange keys, the hardware used to
speed up symmetrc cryptographc algorthms s dle. The same
stuaton for asymmetrc ones happens when symmetrc ones are
actve.
As shown n Fg. , we proposed a reconfgurable hardware
whch solves the processng gap and swtches flexbly between
AES, DES, and RSA. Under consderaton of processng gap, we
use space-tme product as our performance metrcs. We frst
classfy the operaton of the three cryptographc algorthms nto
three classes. Then, we desgn modules for dfferent operaton
classes
respectvely. The three modules are permutaton-
combnaton unt (PCU), computaton unt and memory unt.

Fg. . Reconfgurable Hardware for Secure Embedded System
In ths paper, we proposed a reconfgurable hardware whch can
swtch the executons flexbly between DES, AES, and RSA. Our
desgn has sgnfcant area savng, but less performance loss. The
result of space-tme product s also better than ASIC desgn.
Besdes, our system s reconfgurable archtecture wth the most
common operator, XOR and addton. Usng dfferent context
sequence, we can perform new task composed by addton and
XOR. For further cryptographc algorthms, we can apply them
easly to our hardware.
