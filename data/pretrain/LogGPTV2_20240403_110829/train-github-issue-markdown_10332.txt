As part of #2137 and #456 we have added the crate version to every exported
symbol, but not quite in the correct way.
Right now the final part of the path used for the symbol ends with `"V" +
vers`, which gets passed through the mangler. The original design called for
`@vers` but the `@` isn't a valid symbol on all platforms (I think?) so gets
mangled to `_sbox_`, which is a bizarre way to indicate the version.
Mangling also makes any dots in the version go away so a version "0.2" symbol
will end with "V02".
There is some additional discussion here about how this is supposed to work
that I haven't read.
