User:  Please write a simple script in Python to backup MySQL database to local disk.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script that can be used to back up the MySQL database to a local disk: ```python import os import time import subprocess # Define database parameters db_user = 'username' db_passwd = 'password' db_name = 'database name' # define Backup file name backup_dir = '/backup directory/' backup_time = time.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') backup_file = backup_dir + db_name + '_' + backup_time + '.sql' # backup Database to specified file backup_cmd = 'mysqldump -u{0} -p"{1}" {2} > {3}'.format(db_user, db_passwd, db_name, backup_file) subprocess.call(backup_cmd, shell=True) # Print the backup completion information print('The database backup has been completed, the backup file is:' + backup_file) ``` You need to replace "username", "password", "database name" and "backup directory" with corresponding values respectively, Then save the script as a .py file to perform the backup operation.
