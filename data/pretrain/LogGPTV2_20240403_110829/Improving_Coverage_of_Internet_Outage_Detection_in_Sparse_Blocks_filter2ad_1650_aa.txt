## Abstract
The reliability of the Internet's edge is a growing concern, and accurate outage information is crucial for understanding and improving this reliability. Active and passive methods have provided coverage for over 3M and 2M blocks, respectively, but both struggle with sparse blocks where few addresses respond or generate traffic. We introduce a new Full Block Scanning (FBS) algorithm to enhance active scanning coverage by gathering more information before making decisions about sparse blocks. FBS identifies sparse blocks and delays decisions until sufficient data is collected, addressing concerns about false outages while adhering to strict probe rate limits. Our results show that FBS can correct 1.2M blocks previously too sparse to report accurately and potentially add 1.7M additional blocks, improving overall coverage. Additionally, FBS can be applied retroactively to existing datasets to enhance prior coverage and accuracy.

## 1. Introduction
Internet reliability is a critical concern for all users, and efforts to improve it are ongoing in both industry and government. However, network outages caused by factors such as government intervention, operational misconfiguration, natural disasters, and even regular weather conditions continue to affect many. Various approaches have been developed to measure these outages, including active measurements of weather-related behavior [15], passive observation of government interference [4], active measurement of most of the IPv4 Internet [12], passive observation from distributed probes [16], analysis of CDN traffic [14], and statistical modeling of background radiation [6].

Broad coverage is essential for effective outage detection systems. Active detection systems report coverage for more than 3M /24 blocks [12], and passive systems using CDN data cover more than 2M blocks [14]. Specialized systems like ThunderPing [15] focus on areas with bad weather, while others provide broad, country-level or regional coverage but may lack /24-level granularity within those regions [4, 6].

Despite their broad coverage, each system faces challenges in measuring portions of the Internet where the signal is not strong enough. These systems typically detect and ignore areas with insufficient signal, which can reduce coverage if thresholds are set too high, or risk false outages if set too low.

In this paper, we present two new algorithms: Full Block Scanning (FBS) and Lone-Address-Block Recovery (LABR). FBS improves coverage in active probing while maintaining accuracy and probe rate limits, and LABR increases coverage by providing partial results for blocks with very few active addresses. We evaluate FBS as an extension to Trinocular, showing that it can increase coverage by correctly handling 1.2M blocks and adding 1.7M previously unmeasurable sparse blocks. FBS also improves accuracy by reducing false outages in sparse blocks. The cost is reduced temporal precision, but this is limited, affecting only about one-fifth of blocks. We also examine false uptime by testing against known outages in Iraq in February 2017. All datasets used in this paper are available at no cost [17], and our work has been IRB reviewed and identified as non-human subjects research (USC IRB IIR00001648).

## 2. Challenges to Broad Coverage
Our goal is to detect Internet outages with broad coverage. Table 1 compares the coverage of several published methods, showing that active probing methods like Trinocular provide results for about 3.4M /24 blocks [12], while CDN-based passive methods offer good but slightly less coverage (2.3M blocks for the Akamai/MIT system [14]). Passive methods with network telescopes provide very broad coverage (3.2M blocks [3]), but with less spatial precision. Combinations of methods can improve coverage, but the Akamai/MIT data is not publicly available.

We aim to expand coverage by making previously untrackable blocks trackable. Two main problems limit coverage: sparse blocks and lone addresses.

### 2.1 Problem: Sparse Blocks
Sparse blocks limit coverage because active scanning requires responses. Blocks with long-term sparsity are not measured, and temporary sparsity can lead to false outages. Sparse blocks challenge accuracy due to the trade-off between the amount of probing and the likelihood of getting a response. Trinocular limits each block to 15 probes per round, which can cause false outages if the block is usually responsive but temporarily sparse.

Figure 1 illustrates four different levels of sparsity, showing individual address responses and Trinocular state inferences. As the block becomes denser, Trinocular's inference correctness improves. Problematic blocks have low long-term or short-term response probabilities. Prior systems filter out sparse blocks, and Trinocular marks very sparse blocks as untrackable. We consider blocks sparse when the short-term estimate of availability is below a threshold (currently 0.2). Sparse blocks represent only 22% of all blocks but account for 80% of blocks with frequent outages.

### 2.2 Problem: Lone Addresses
Lone address blocks, where only one or two addresses are active, pose another challenge. A single non-responsive address may indicate a network outage or a problem with a specific host, leading to ambiguous implications. Trinocular avoids blocks with few addresses, while ThunderPing tracks individual addresses but probes multiple targets to mitigate the risk of single-address decisions.

An example block with a lone address is shown in Figure 1. Our goal is to handle such blocks correctly in both states: with many addresses and with a lone address.

## 3. Improving Outage Detection
### 3.1 Full Block Scanning for Sparse Blocks
Trinocular makes decisions based on limited information, forcing a decision after 15 probes per round. We address this with Full Block Scanning (FBS), which combines multiple rounds until all active addresses in the block have been scanned. This ensures decisions are made with complete information while limiting the scan rate.

Formally, a Full Round ends when the sum of addresses probed in the minimum number of Trinocular Rounds (TRs) equals the number of ever-active addresses in the block. Trinocular probes addresses in a pseudo-random sequence, ensuring each address is probed when enough addresses are counted across sequential TRs.

FBS overrides outages if the block is currently sparse and the most recent Full Round included a positive response. The cost is reduced temporal precision, but this is limited to about one-fifth of blocks. The reduction in precision depends on the number of addresses scanned per TR and the size of the Full Round.

### 3.2 Lone-Address-Block Recovery
FBS repairs blocks with at least one responsive address, extending coverage to many sparse blocks. However, for blocks with a single active address, a non-reply may indicate a network outage or a problem with the host. To avoid false down events, we define Lone-Address-Block Recovery (LABR), which accepts up events but converts down events to "unknown" for blocks with very few recently active addresses.
