ABSTRACT
The Second International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Sys-
tems Security and PrivaCy (CPS-SPC’16) is being held in
conjunction with the 23rd ACM CCS Conference. This sec-
ond edition follows a successful workshop held with ACM
CCS in 2015. The workshop was motivated by several ob-
servations. First, cyber-physical systems represent the new
frontier for cyber risk. The attack surface imposed by the
convergence of computing, communications and physical con-
trol represents unique challenges for security researchers and
practitioners. Second, majority of the published literature
addressing the security and privacy of CPS reﬂect a ﬁeld
still in its infancy. As such, the overall principles, mod-
els, and theories for securing CPS have not yet emerged.
Third, the organizers of this workshop strongly felt that a
premiere forum associated with a premiere conference was
needed for rapidly publishing diverse, multidisciplinary in-
progress work on the security and privacy of CPS and galva-
nizing the research community. The set of accepted papers
reﬂect this vision. We have organized an exciting program
for this workshop and look forward to active participation
in this and future workshops.

INTRODUCTION
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate computing and
communication capabilities with monitoring and control of
entities in the physical world. These systems are usually
composed by a set of networked agents, including sensors,
actuators, control processing units, and communication de-
vices. While some forms of CPS are already in use, the
widespread growth of wireless embedded sensors and ac-
tuators is creating several new applications in areas such
as medical devices, automotive, and smart infrastructure.
Equally important is the emergence of Internet of Things

(IoT) and how IoT will interface with control systems. As
such, there is an increasing role that cyber infrastructures
will play in existing control systems and in domains as di-
verse as the process control industry, the power grid, oil and
natural gas infrastructure, autonomous vehicle and trans-
portation systems, and medical devices and systems.
Many CPS applications are safety-critical: their failure
can cause irreparable harm to the physical system under
control and to the people who depend on it.
In particu-
lar, the protection of our critical infrastructures that rely on
CPS, such as the electric power transmission and distribu-
tion, industrial control systems, oil and natural gas systems,
water and waste-water treatment plants, healthcare devices,
and transportation networks play a fundamental and large-
scale role in our society—and their disruption can have a
signiﬁcant impact to individuals, and nations at large.
Similarly, because many CPS systems collect sensor data
non-intrusively, users of these systems are often unaware
of their exposure. Therefore in addition to security, CPS
systems must be designed with privacy considerations.
The challenges in securing CPS are many. But fundamen-
tally, it is important to recognize that securing CPS diﬀers
from the traditional cyber security concerns of conﬁdential-
ity, integrity and availability (CIA) that have dominated the
security of information technology (IT) systems. At its core,
CPS security must be approached and framed from the per-
spective of how attacks on CIA properties perturb control-
theoretic properties such as controllability, observability and
stability, and in turn the impact on overall system reliability
and safety.
2. OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE
The objective and vision of the workshop is that it be-
comes the premiere forum to publish research on CPS secu-
rity and privacy. As such the second edition of this workshop
builds on vision set by the ﬁrst workshop and invited par-
ticipation from diverse CPS domains, researchers and prac-
titioners, and encompassed a range of topics. Submissions
were sought from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds rep-
resentative of CPS, including but not limited to information
security, control theory, embedded systems, and human fac-
tors. In particular, the workshop sought contributions in the
following topic areas:
• mathematical foundations for secure CPS
• control theoretic approaches to secure CPS
• security architectures for CPS
