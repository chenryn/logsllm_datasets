Since upgrading to Vue 3 is not currently a viable option, I have implemented a small workaround to make my class (which is a subclass of `Array`) reactive while maintaining its identity. However, this approach results in an error when I attempt to call the `sort` method on the array.

A potential fix could be to check if `ob` (the observer) is defined before accessing any of its members. Specifically, the following lines in `vue/src/core/observer/array.js` need to be updated:

#### vue/src/core/observer/array.js
- **Line 40** (Commit: e7cf063)
  ```javascript
  if (inserted) ob.observeArray(inserted)
  ```
- **Line 42** (Commit: e7cf063)
  ```javascript
  ob.dep.notify()
  ```

By adding a check to ensure `ob` is defined, we can prevent the error from occurring. For example:

```javascript
if (ob && inserted) ob.observeArray(inserted)
```

and

```javascript
if (ob) ob.dep.notify()
```

This should resolve the issue and allow the `sort` method to work as expected.
