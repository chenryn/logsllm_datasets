Since upgrading to Vue 3 is not currently a viable option, I perform a small
hack to make my class (which is a subclass of Array) reactive while
maintaining its identity. This, however, results in an error when I try to
call `sort` on it.
A simple fix could be checking if `ob` is defined before attempting to access
any of its members.  
vue/src/core/observer/array.js
Line 40 in e7cf063
|  if (inserted) ob.observeArray(inserted)

vue/src/core/observer/array.js
Line 42 in e7cf063
|  ob.dep.notify()
