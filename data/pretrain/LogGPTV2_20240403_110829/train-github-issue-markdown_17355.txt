Validation caching merges constraints for class and all of its parents. It's
wrong behaviour, because the class already contains constraints from parent
classes. As a result we have duplicated constraint.
### The way to reproduce
Create two models, the second one extends the first one:
    namespace AppBundle\Model;
    class Foo
    {
        public $foo;
    }
    namespace AppBundle\Model;
    class Bar extends Foo
    {
    }
Create validation config, add constraint to the first class, the second class
should be defined (empty or with some constraints)
    AppBundle\Model\Foo:
        constraints:
            - Expression: "this.foo !== null"
    AppBundle\Model\Bar:
And validation of new `Bar` object will generates two duplicated violations:
    $container->get('validator')->validate(new Bar()));
Note: this code should be executed in prod environment, because test
environment doesn't use validation cache by default.
