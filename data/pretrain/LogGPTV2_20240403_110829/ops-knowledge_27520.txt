User: I'm new to using multiple cpu's to process jobs and was wondering if people could let me know the pro/cons of parallelpython(or any type of python module) versus hadoop streaming?  
I have a very large cpu intensive process that I would like to spread across several servers.
Assistant: The main difference is that Hadoop is good at processing big data (dozen to terabytes of data). It provides a simple logical framework called MapReduce which is well appropriate for data aggregation, and a distributed storage system called HDFS.
If your inputs are smaller than 1 gigabyte, you probably don't want to use Hadoop.
