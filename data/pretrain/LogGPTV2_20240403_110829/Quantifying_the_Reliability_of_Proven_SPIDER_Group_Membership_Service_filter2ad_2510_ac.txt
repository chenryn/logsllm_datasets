curred at approximately a BER of 10-14 for asymmetric
faults and 10-15 for symmetric faults. Above these points,
the ‘All Transient’ strategy was advantageous. Below these
points, the ‘All Permanent’ strategy was advantageous.
• Sensitivity to Fault Type: How does assumption
reliability differ with respect to the type of fault incurred
(benign, symmetric, or asymmetric?)
The Maximum Fault Assumption reliability also dif-
fered greatly depending on the type of fault. MFA reliabil-
ity was poorest when subject to asymmetric faults, with no
design points achieving the best reliability of fewer than
10-11 assumption violations per hour for any of the policies.

6.1. Design Space
6.2. Policy Trade-off
One goal was to determine the design space in which the
Maximum Fault Assumption is expected to have adequate
reliability. For this study, we examined the combinations of
parameters from Table 1 with a Bit Error Rate of between
10-12 and 10-9. Next, we limited this population to design
points that might achieve a reliability level of 10-9 fail-
ures/hour or better. Single BIU or single RMU configura-
tions were omitted here, as the MFA would be violated as
soon the single BIU or RMU became faulty. The perma-
nent fault rate of the BIU (10-5) or RMU (10-6) bounds the
reliability. Asymmetric and symmetric configurations with
two BIUs or two RMUs were also excluded here, as a single
faulty BIU or RMU would violate the Maximum Fault As-
sumption. However, for benign faults, two BIU or RMU
systems will function despite a single fault, so these config-
urations were included here. There were 1,008 design
points per conviction policy, for a total of 3,024 points.
Table 2 summarizes overall design space results. For
each design point, we calculated the probability that the
Maximum Fault Assumption would not hold. Table 2 gives
the percentage of design points that fall into six reliability
bands, per conviction policy. For example, out of the 1008
design points considered for the ‘All Permanent’ strategy,
579 points (57.4%) had a 10-3 chance per hour or greater of
the Maximum Fault Assumption being violated, showing
that service reliability is expected to be poor. We observe:
• Wide reliability spread - Design points occupy each of
the reliability bands.
Even with the same formal proof foundation, assump-
tion reliability can vary greatly due to choice of design pa-
rameters. Therefore, it is essential that the reliability of the
assumptions be tested. Otherwise, a designer risks deploy-
ing an inadequately reliable system. Recall that obviously
unreliable design points were excluded from Table 2, just as
a designer would exclude them from consideration.
• At this level of granularity, the ‘All Transient’ strategy
seems superior to the ‘All Permanent’ strategy.
This is an interesting conclusion, since the ‘All Tran-
sient’ strategy never convicts any nodes - it is basically a
no-op strategy. For the parameter range studied (BER of
10-12 through 10-9 and permanent fault arrival rates of 10-5
and 10-6), the results indicate that transient faults are the
dominant type of fault. The reliability cost due to lost re-
dundancy is greater than the reliability cost of unconvicted
permanently faulty nodes. For these parameters, taking no
action seems preferable to an inappropriate conviction.
• The ‘Perfect’ strategy outperforms the others, but has
fairly close distribution to the ‘All Transient’ strategy.
The perfect strategy is superior by construction, but re-
quires that the service perfectly discriminate between per-
manent and transient faults. The data show that perfection
is not necessary to attain adequate reliability.
Protocol fault tolerance strategies, including SPIDER’s,
usually emphasize a permanent fault model. These as-
sumption reliability estimates show that the effects of tran-
sient faults are non-negligible, and may dwarf the impact of
permanent faults.
For what range of design space is the ‘All Transient’ pol-
icy expected to be better? We expect the trade-off point to
depend on the ratio of the transient fault arrival rate vs. the
permanent fault arrival rates. Equation 1 approximates the
trade-off point. The transient fault arrival rate equals the
Bit Error Rate times the data rate (1 MBit/sec), in hours.
Nodes participating in group membership typically trans-
mit a frame in each allotted time slot, so we assumed that
the full bandwidth is used. The permanent fault arrival
rates are 1*10-5 faults/hour for the BIUs and 1*10-6
faults/hour for the RMUs. Equation 1 approximates the
permanent fault arrival rate as 5*10-5 faults/hour. Equation
1 assumes each bit corruption causes a unique faulty frame.
This is slightly pessimistic, since multiple bit corruptions in
the same frame would create only one faulty frame.

Solving this equation for the BER gives a BER of about
1 * 10-14. One would expect the ‘All Transient’ policy to
perform better at higher BERs and the ‘All Permanent’ pol-
icy to perform better at lower BERs. To test this, we exam-
ined 9,450 configurations ranging from a BER of 10-17
through 10-9, with each fault type tested independently. For
this experiment, we included the 1 and 2 BIU or RMU con-
figurations, as the aim was to determine which policy was
better, and not to achieve a fixed reliability goal. For be-
nign faults, the ‘All Transient’ policy always outperforms
the ‘All Permanent’ policy, since conviction has no benefit.
Figures 3 and 4 summarize data comparing the reliability
of the ‘All Transient’ and ‘All Permanent’ policies with
respect to BER. We used a ‘twice as reliable’ metric to
highlight differences. If one policy had X assumption vio-
lations/hour estimated for a particular design point, a com-
peting policy would need an estimate of X/2 assumption

For larger BERs,
violations/hour to be considered twice as reliable. Since the
measurements differed in precision, we did not use
statistical significance as a metric. There are 1,050 design
points for each BER. For each BER, Figures 3 and 4 show
the percent of design points where the ‘All Permanent’
strategy was twice as reliable, where the ‘All Transient’
strategy was twice as reliable, and where neither strategy
was twice as reliable as the other. Observations include:
The ‘All Transient’ policy shows superior assumption
•
reliability for the BER range expected of aviation and
aerospace systems (about 10-12 through 10-9).The trade-off
region occurs approximately where expected, at a BER
range of 10-14 to 10-12 in Figure 3 for asymmetric faults, and
a BER range of 10-15 to 10-12 in Figure 4 for symmetric
faults.
the ‘All Transient’ strategy
generally outperforms the ‘All Permanent’ strategy (for
configurations where a difference is observed).
•
asymmetric vs. symmetric faults. For asymmetric faults,
not convicting a node presents larger risk, as MFA.3
states that any BIU may not be asymmetrically faulty at
the same time as any RMU, and vice-versa. The ‘All
Permanent’ conviction strategy outperforms the ‘All
Transient’ strategy at higher BERs compared to the
symmetric fault case. For symmetric faults, MFA.1 and
MFA.2 require a majority of good BIUs and a majority of
good RMUs. An unconvicted permanently faulty node
will be less detrimental, as long as there are redundant
nodes (i.e., more than 2 BIUs and RMUs).
• For about half of the design points, neither policy
outperforms the other, shown by the white bars in
Figures 3 and 4. This is true for all BERs. Given a fixed
conviction policy, a designer might change other system
parameters to maximize assumption reliability.
The trade-off range is slightly different when subject to
6.3. Fault Types
Tables 3, 4, and 5 summarize the assumption reliabil-
ity of design points classified by fault type. These results
are for BERs of 10-9 through 10-12, omitting configura-
tions bounded by the permanent fault rates of compo-
nents (the 1 and 2 BIU or RMU configurations for
asymmetric and symmetric faults, and the 1 BIU or
RMU configurations for benign faults). Because there
are more benign configurations, percentages are also
given. Actual systems would experience a mix of the
three fault types instead of a hundred percent of a single
type. If a design point tolerates all three types of faults
with acceptable assumption reliability, then it will toler-
ate any combination of those types of faults. However,
this could be extremely conservative, as benign faults
typically represent a large percentage of total faults. Fu-
ture work will investigate mixed fault models.
• Asymmetric (Table 3)
Models subject to 100% asymmetric faults show the
lowest overall assumption reliability levels. For the ‘All
Permanent’ policy, no configurations achieved a level of
10-9 assumption violations/hour or better.
The ‘All
Transient’ policy had no configurations at a level of 10-7 as-
sumption violations/hour or better. It is interesting that the
‘All Permanent’ policy can achieve higher assumption reli-
ability than the ‘All Transient’ policy. This suggests that
the penalty for leaving an asymmetric faulty node in the
system can be large. Even for the most pernicious fault
type, it might be possible to meet safety-critical assumption
reliability requirements. For the Perfect policy, some con-
in the 10-9 to 10-11 assumption viola-
figurations fall
tions/hour range. However, the Perfect policy serves as a
theoretical bound as this policy requires perfect discrimina-
tion between transient and permanent faults. No policy had
configurations better than 10-11 assumption violations/hour.
