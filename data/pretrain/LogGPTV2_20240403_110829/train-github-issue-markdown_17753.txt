OpenCV 4.0.0 alpha cannot be easily included in a /clr or /clr:pure Visual
Studio project, because of the new native use of ``, which is forbidden
in that case.  
It would be easy to fix it, using a cv::Mutex wrapper around
std::recursive_mutex (instead of straight typedef), with an opaque
implementation that would only include `` in the cpp file.  
But would such a patch be accepted ?
