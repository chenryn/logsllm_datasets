I'm trying to test my functions that utilize the Web Crypto API, for example:
    const { webkit } = require("playwright")
    async function importKey() {
      return window.crypto.subtle.importKey("raw", new Uint8Array(8), "HKDF", false, ["deriveKey"])
    }
    (async function test() {
      const browser = await webkit.launch()
      const page = await browser.newPage()
      await page.goto("https://example.com")
      // how to test `importKey` with the Playwright context's `window.crypto`?
      await browser.close()
    })()
I was thinking about running a dev server that hosts a page with a JS file
that contains the `importKey` function and visiting this page with Playwright.
Is there a simpler way to use my custom modules inside Playwright that use Web
APIs?
