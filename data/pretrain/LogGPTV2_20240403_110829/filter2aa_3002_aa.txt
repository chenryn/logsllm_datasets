OPINION
CALLAHAN, Circuit Judge:
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) is the creator of
World of Warcraft (“WoW”), a popular multiplayer online
role-playing game in which players interact in a virtual world
while advancing through the game’s 70 levels. MDY Indus-
tries, LLC and its sole member Michael Donnelly
(“Donnelly”) (sometimes referred to collectively as “MDY”)
developed and sold Glider, a software program that automati-
cally plays the early levels of WoW for players.

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 4 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
MDY brought this action for a declaratory judgment to
establish that its Glider sales do not infringe Blizzard’s copy-
right or other rights, and Blizzard asserted counterclaims
under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), 17
U.S.C. § 1201 et seq., and for tortious interference with con-
tract under Arizona law. The district court found MDY and
Donnelly liable for secondary copyright infringement, viola-
tions of DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1), and tortious inter-
ference with contract. We reverse the district court except as
to MDY’s liability for violation of DMCA § 1201(a)(2) and
remand for trial on Blizzard’s claim for tortious interference
with contract.
I.
A. World of Warcraft
In November 2004, Blizzard created WoW, a “massively
multiplayer online role-playing game” in which players inter-
act in a virtual world. WoW has ten million subscribers, of
which two and a half million are in North America. The WoW
software has two components: (1) the game client software
that a player installs on the computer; and (2) the game server
software, which the player accesses on a subscription basis by
connecting to WoW’s online servers. WoW does not have
single-player or offline modes.
WoW players roleplay different characters, such as
humans, elves, and dwarves. A player’s central objective is to
advance the character through the game’s 70 levels by partici-
pating in quests and engaging in battles with monsters. As a
player advances, the character collects rewards such as in-
game currency, weapons, and armor. WoW’s virtual world
has its own economy, in which characters use their virtual
currency to buy and sell items directly from each other,
through vendors, or using auction houses. Some players also
utilize WoW’s chat capabilities to interact with others.

B. Blizzard’s use agreements
Each WoW player must read and accept Blizzard’s End
User License Agreement (“EULA”) and Terms of Use
(“ToU”) on multiple occasions. The EULA pertains to the
game client, so a player agrees to it both before installing the
game client and upon first running it. The ToU pertains to the
online service, so a player agrees to it both when creating an
account and upon first connecting to the online service. Play-
ers who do not accept both the EULA and the ToU may return
the game client for a refund.
C. Development of Glider and Warden
Donnelly is a WoW player and software programmer. In
March 2005, he developed Glider, a software “bot” (short for
robot) that automates play of WoW’s early levels, for his per-
sonal use. A user need not be at the computer while Glider is
running. As explained in the Frequently Asked Questions
(“FAQ”) on MDY’s website for Glider:
Glider . . . moves the mouse around and pushes keys
on the keyboard. You tell it about your character,
where you want to kill things, and when you want to
kill. Then it kills for you, automatically. You can do
something else, like eat dinner or go to a movie, and
when you return, you’ll have a lot more experience
and loot.
Glider does not alter or copy WoW’s game client software,
does not allow a player to avoid paying monthly subscription
dues to Blizzard, and has no commercial use independent of
WoW. Glider was not initially designed to avoid detection by
Blizzard. 
The parties dispute Glider’s impact on the WoW experi-
ence. Blizzard contends that Glider disrupts WoW’s environ-
ment for non-Glider players by enabling Glider users to

MDY INDUSTRIES v. BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT
Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 6 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
advance quickly and unfairly through the game and to amass
additional game assets. MDY contends that Glider has a mini-
mal effect on non-Glider players, enhances the WoW experi-
ence for Glider users, and facilitates disabled players’ access
to WoW by auto-playing the game for them.
In summer 2005, Donnelly began selling Glider through
MDY’s website for fifteen to twenty-five dollars per license.
Prior to marketing Glider, Donnelly reviewed Blizzard’s
EULA and client-server manipulation policy. He reached the
conclusion that Blizzard had not prohibited bots in those doc-
uments. 
In September 2005, Blizzard launched Warden, a technol-
ogy that it developed to prevent its players who use unautho-
rized third-party software, including bots, from connecting to
WoW’s servers. Warden was able to detect Glider, and Bliz-
zard immediately used Warden to ban most Glider users.
MDY responded by modifying Glider to avoid detection and
promoting its new anti-detection features on its website’s
FAQ. It added a subscription service, Glider Elite, which
offered “additional protection from game detection software”
for five dollars a month.
Thus, by late 2005, MDY was aware that Blizzard was pro-
hibiting bots. MDY modified its website to indicate that using
Glider violated Blizzard’s ToU. In November 2005, Donnelly
wrote in an email interview, “Avoiding detection is rather
exciting, to be sure. Since Blizzard does not want bots run-
ning at all, it’s a violation to use them.” Following MDY’s
anti-detection modifications, Warden only occasionally
detected Glider. As of September 2008, MDY had gross reve-
nues of $3.5 million based on 120,000 Glider license sales.
D. Financial and practical impact of Glider
Blizzard claims that from December 2004 to March 2008,
it received 465,000 complaints about WoW bots, several

Case: 09-16044   12/14/2010   Page: 7 of 47    ID: 7579806   DktEntry: 54-1
thousand of which named Glider. Blizzard spends $940,000
annually to respond to these complaints, and the parties have
stipulated that Glider is the principal bot used by WoW play-
ers. Blizzard introduced evidence that it may have lost
monthly subscription fees from Glider users, who were able
to reach WoW’s highest levels in fewer weeks than players
playing manually. Donnelly acknowledged in a November
2005 email that MDY’s business strategy was to make Bliz-
zard’s anti-bot detection attempts financially prohibitive:
The trick here is that Blizzard has a finite amount of
development and test resources, so we want to make
it bad business to spend that much time altering their
detection code to find Glider, since Glider’s negative
effect on the game is debatable . . . . [W]e attack
th[is] weakness and try to make it a bad idea or make
their changes very risky, since they don’t want to
risk banning or crashing innocent customers.
E. Pre-litigation contact between MDY and Blizzard
In August 2006, Blizzard sent MDY a cease-and-desist let-
ter alleging that MDY’s website hosted WoW screenshots and
a Glider install file, all of which infringed Blizzard’s copy-
rights. Donnelly removed the screenshots and requested Bliz-
zard to clarify why the install file was infringing, but Blizzard
did not respond. In October 2006, Blizzard’s counsel visited
Donnelly’s home, threatening suit unless MDY immediately
ceased selling Glider and remitted all profits to Blizzard.
MDY immediately commenced this action.
II.
On December 1, 2006, MDY filed an amended complaint
seeking a declaration that Glider does not infringe Blizzard’s
copyright or other rights. In February 2007, Blizzard filed
counterclaims and third-party claims against MDY and Don-
nelly for, inter alia, contributory and vicarious copyright

infringement, violation of DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1),
and tortious interference with contract.
In July 2008, the district court granted Blizzard partial sum-
mary judgment, finding that MDY’s Glider sales contribu-
torily and vicariously infringed Blizzard’s copyrights and
tortiously interfered with Blizzard’s contracts. The district
court also granted MDY partial summary judgment, finding
that MDY did not violate DMCA § 1201(a)(2) with respect to
accessing the game software’s source code.
In September 2008, the parties stipulated to entry of a $6
million judgment against MDY for the copyright infringement
and tortious interference with contract claims. They further
stipulated that Donnelly would be personally liable for the
same amount if found personally liable at trial. After a Janu-
ary 2009 bench trial, the district court held MDY liable under
DMCA §§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1). It also held Donnelly per-
sonally liable for MDY’s copyright infringement, DMCA vio-
lations, and tortious interference with contract.
On April 1, 2009, the district court entered judgment
against MDY and Donnelly for $6.5 million, an adjusted fig-
ure to which the parties stipulated based on MDY’s DMCA
liability and post-summary judgment Glider sales. The district
court permanently enjoined MDY from distributing Glider.
MDY’s efforts to stay injunctive relief pending appeal were
unsuccessful. On April 29, 2009, MDY timely filed this
appeal. On May 12, 2009, Blizzard timely cross-appealed the
district court’s holding that MDY did not violate DMCA
§§ 1201(a)(2) and (b)(1) as to the game software’s source
code.

or denying summary judgment; (2) conclusions of law after a
bench trial; and (3) interpretations of state law. Padfield v.
