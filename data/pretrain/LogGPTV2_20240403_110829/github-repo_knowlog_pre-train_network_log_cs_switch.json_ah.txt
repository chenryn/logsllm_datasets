The domain router starts this process when it receives a new zone list from a domain that is identical to the list in the main routing table and whose network range length matches that in this list. The loop detection process sends several AppleTalk NBP loopback packets. When one of these packets is received on an interface that does not belong to the original domain the domain router first shuts off all the domains involved in the loop and then shuts off all the interfaces in these domains. The loop detection does not catch all types of loops. It is your responsibility to make sure that no loop exists."
