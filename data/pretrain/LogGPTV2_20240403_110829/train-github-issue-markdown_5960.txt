I have been experiencing this issue for the past two versions or more. Here is a video demonstrating the problem: [Dropbox Video Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0yiq384ihyqul5l/atom_bug.mov?dl=0). Could you please investigate and attempt to resolve it?

Additional details:
- The files are stored on a remote drive.
- I am using Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite). Atom was initially installed around Beta 1 and is now updated to the latest release version.

Thank you for your assistance.
