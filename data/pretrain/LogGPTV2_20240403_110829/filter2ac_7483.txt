### Title: Black Hat US-19: GDPArrrrr - Exploiting Privacy Laws to Steal Identities

On May 25, 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect, marking the most comprehensive governmental effort to regulate data security and privacy to date. One of the key provisions of the GDPR is the "Right of Access," which grants individuals the right to access their personal data. Unfortunately, this provision can be easily exploited by social engineers to steal sensitive information that does not belong to them.

My research focuses on a practical case study where I attempted to gather as much information as possible about my fianc√© (with her consent) using GDPR Subject Access Requests. In a survey of over 150 companies, I found that organizations frequently provide highly sensitive information in response to GDPR right of access requests with little or no verification of the requester's identity. This information ranges from typical sensitive data such as addresses and credit card information to more esoteric data like a history of train journeys or a list of domains owned.

Alarmingly, in many cases, no proof of identity is required at all. Even in the best-case scenarios, the GDPR allows someone capable of stealing or forging a driving license nearly complete access to an individual's digital life. Furthermore, the highly standardized nature of GDPR requests makes it possible to automate this process on a large scale, providing one of the most reliable general phishing attack typologies to date.

This issue is solvable and could have been addressed if regulatory legislation were subjected to the same security assessments used for modern software. My presentation will suggest possible remediations and offer a cautionary tale for future policymakers designing GDPR-inspired privacy legislation. It will also provide short-term strategies for individuals and businesses to protect themselves against these attacks.
