User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题pam_ldap.so before pam_unix.so? Is it ever possible? we have a couple of servers with PAM+LDAP.

The configuration is standard (see http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/setup or http://wiki.debian.org/LDAP/PAM).
For example, /etc/pam.d/common-auth contains:

auth sufficient pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth requisite pam_succeed_if.so uid &gt;= 1000 quiet
auth sufficient pam_ldap.so use_first_pass
auth required pam_deny.so


And, of course, it works for both ldap and local users.
But every login goes first to pam_unix.so, fails, and only then tries pam_ldap.so successfully. As a result, we have a well-known failure message for every single ldap user login:

pam_unix(&lt;some_service&gt;:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=&lt;some_host&gt;  user=&lt;some_user&gt;


I have up to 60000 of such log messages per day and I want to change the configuration so, that PAM will try ldap authentication first, and only if it fails - try pam_unix.so (I think it can improve the i/o performance of the server). But if I change common-auth to the following:

auth sufficient pam_ldap.so use_first_pass
auth sufficient pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth required pam_deny.so


Then I simply can't login anymore with local (non-ldap) user (e.g., via ssh).

Does somebody know the right configuration? Why Debian and nss-pam-ldapd have pam_unix.so at first by default? Is there really no way to change it?

Thank you in advance.

P.S. I don't want to disable logs, but want to set ldap authentication on the first place.

Assistant: If local and network users are in separate uid ranges (which is a good idea), you may add a line like this one (supposing local users are in range 0-4999):

auth [success=1 default=ignore] pam_succeed_if.so uid &gt;= 5000 quiet


before the pam_unix.so line. It will pass 1 line if uid >= 4999. It will go directly to pam_ldap.so.

And you have to change pam_ldap.so use_first_pass to pam_ldap.so or pam_ldap.so try_first_pass if you don't have a line that ask for the password before pam_ldap.so.

I'd test with :

auth [success=1 default=ignore] pam_succeed_if.so uid &gt;= 4999 quiet
auth sufficient pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth requisite pam_succeed_if.so uid &gt;= 4999 quiet
auth sufficient pam_ldap.so
auth required pam_deny.so
