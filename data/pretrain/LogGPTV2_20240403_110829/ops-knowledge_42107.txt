User: Please explain what are the file permission systems in the Linux system? And give the corresponding command and usage.
Assistant: In the Linux system, the file permission system has three basic permissions, which are file owner permissions, file user group permissions, and other user permissions. Each permission has a corresponding abbreviation, r (read permission), w (write permission), and x (execute permission). The following are commonly used file permission commands and usage in Linux systems: 1. chmod: This command is used to modify the permissions of files or directories. Its syntax is as follows: chmod [option] mode file name Among them, mode represents the permission mode, which can be represented by numbers or symbols. The digital form uses 3 octal numbers (for example, 750 or 644), corresponding to the permissions of the file owner, the permission of the user group to which the file belongs, and other user permissions. The symbolic form uses the three letters r, w, and x, plus a plus sign + or minus sign - to increase or decrease the permissions of the file. For example, +"rwx" means to add read, write, and execute permissions, and "âˆ’w" means to remove write permissions. 2. chown: This command is used to modify the owner and user group of a file or directory. Its syntax is as follows: chown [option] owner: the name of the user group file where the owner represents the new owner of the file or directory, and user name or user ID can be used. Belonging user group indicates the new user group to which the file or directory belongs, and the group name or group ID can be used. 3. chgrp: This command is used to modify the user group to which a file or directory belongs. Its syntax is as follows: chgrp [option] user group file name Among them, user group represents the new user group to which the file or directory belongs, and the group name or group ID can be used. 4. ls: This command is used to list all files and directories in the current directory, as well as their permission information. Its syntax is as follows: ls [option] [file name] Among them, the option can be used to control the format and content of the output, for example -l means long format output (including file permissions, owner and user group and other information). 5. umask: This command is used to set the new file creation permission mask. Its syntax is as follows: umask [mode] Among them, the mode represents a 3-digit octal number used to control the default permissions of newly created files or directories. For example, umask 022 means that the default permission of newly created files is 644, and the default permission of newly created directories is 755.
