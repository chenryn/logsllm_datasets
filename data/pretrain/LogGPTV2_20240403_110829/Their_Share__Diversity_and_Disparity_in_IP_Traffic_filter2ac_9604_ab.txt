### Equation and Distribution Analysis

The equation of interest is given by:
\[
\frac{1 - s^{-\alpha+1}}{1 - N^{-\alpha+1}} = 1.
\]
For the Zipf distribution, where \(\alpha = 1\), the function \(M(s)\) is defined as:
\[
M(s) = \frac{\ln s}{\ln N}.
\]

We derive an approximate solution to the equation \(F(s) + M(s) = 1\), or equivalently \(F(s) = 1 - f\) and \(M(s) = f\), by neglecting the term \(N^{-\alpha}\) in the denominator of \(F(s)\). The 80/20 rule, which is a characteristic of the Zipf distribution, is observed at \(N \approx 3000\) (i.e., \(e^8\)) and \(s \approx 5\) (i.e., \(e^{1.6}\)). For a 90/10 split, \(N = 10^{10}\) and \(s = 10\). This suggests that the 80/20 rule may have its origin in the Zipf distribution, with a ratio of 3000 from the highest to the lowest value. This disparity is similar to the bitrate consumption observed in most ISPs, where only a few offer a wide range of bitrates, such as DSL at 512 Kbps to OC-48 at 2.5 Gbps, covering approximately 3.5 orders of magnitude.

For \(\alpha > 1\), the equation simplifies to \(s^\alpha = s + 1\) for large \(N\). When \(\alpha = 2\), this results in a golden section split of 62/38. Generally, as \(\alpha\) increases, the split becomes more even because larger sizes become less likely.

More extreme splits, such as 90/10, occur in the Zipf distribution only when \(N\) exceeds the typical traffic range (e.g., 95/5 requires \(N = 10^{26}\)). However, the Pareto distribution with \(\alpha < 1\) can produce these extreme splits for moderate values of \(N\). For example, when \(\alpha = 0.5\), the equation holds for any \(N\), resulting in a 90/10 split at \(N \approx 6600\) (i.e., \(e^{8.8}\)) and \(s \approx 90\), and a 95/5 split at \(N \approx 133,000\) (i.e., \(e^{11.8}\)) and \(s \approx 365\).

### Data Sources and Collection

We use four of the longest datasets from our Backbone Traffic Data Kit (Table 1): D04, D05, D08, and D09. The data in D04, D08, and D09 were collected using OC-48 monitors with DAG 4 cards from U.Waikato/Endace on a Linux platform. D04 contains 8 hours of OC-48 traffic at up to 28.5% utilization, taken at Tier 1 Backbone 1 (BB1) in August 2002. D08 and D09 were captured in May 2003. D08 covers 48 hours of BB1 traffic from the same link as D04, but at lower utilization. D09 contains 2 hours of OC-48 traffic at up to 30.6% utilization, taken in Tier 1 Backbone 2 (BB2). The backbone links connect San Jose in the south to Seattle in the north. Both BB1 and BB2 use Packet over Sonet (POS), and BB2 prepends 80% of packets with 4-byte MPLS headers, using fewer than 50 distinct labels in each direction.

D05 was collected on an OC-12 (622 Mbps) ATM link that carries traffic between a university and the Internet. We label link directions by the prevalence of inbound (I) and outbound (O) traffic, although multihoming means each direction carries both. D05 was collected on the same day as D04. All traces are captured in the middle of the week around noon. We used CoralReef and other CAIDA programs for data processing.

### Traffic Characteristics

The raw diversity of our data is high, with differences in utilization, traffic symmetry, and temporal dependencies. Figure 2 shows the number of bytes, flows, source-destination pairs, and packets over 64-second intervals. The stationarity of the traces indicates that their volume distributions are consistent from a stochastic perspective.

An interesting property of traces D04 and D09 is the equality between the orders of magnitude for bitrate (Mbps) and the number of active flows per 64-second interval. The maximum flow rate is 48,702 flows/second for D04S and 20,778 flows/second for D09N. The maximum number of source-destination pairs is 24,310 for D04S and 15,531 for D09N. For 64-second intervals, the maximum number of flows is 1.71 million for D04S and 719,000 for D09N. D08 and D05 also show diurnal variation with a factor of 2-6X.

Another notable property is the almost constant average bytes/flow, consistently around 10 kbytes. The ratios of packets/flow, packets/destination, and bytes/packet are also of the same order of magnitude for most traces, except for the inbound university trace D05I, which is skewed by backscatter, scans, and other debris attracted to a large address block.

### Prefix/AS Diversity

The diversity of prefixes and ASes in our data is also high. Together, sources and destinations on both directions of each link cover 30-55% of RouteViews (semiglobal) prefixes and 42-62% of ASes. However, the disparity in coverage between directions can be significant, such as in D09, where the northern side of the link has data from/to only 1.5-4% of prefixes and ASes.

### Extreme Disparity

Packet floods, DDoS attacks, and IP address and port scans are typically viewed as traffic anomalies. However, each trace in our study contains examples of these phenomena, rendering them normal in highly multiplexed traffic. These events represent cases of extreme size disparity at particular aggregation levels.

Floods aim to overwhelm the receiving machine, often sending many small packets, increasing packet rates without proportional growth in utilization. DDoS attacks, such as those in D04 (Figure 2, lower left), involve sweeping /16 address blocks of an academic network in Asia, targeting hosts on consumer networks in the US and Turkey. These attacks change packet rates but to a much smaller extent.

IP address and port scans, often conducted by viruses and hackers, appear as a large number of source-destination pairs or flows. Figure 3 shows bursts in new source-destination pairs per minute due to repetitive scans going north. Scans may also be present in D09 (Figure 2, right). Figure 5 (upper left) indicates a large number of destination IP addresses with small (40-200 bytes) traffic volumes, concentrated at a few small packet sizes, reflecting SYN probes from scanning tools.
