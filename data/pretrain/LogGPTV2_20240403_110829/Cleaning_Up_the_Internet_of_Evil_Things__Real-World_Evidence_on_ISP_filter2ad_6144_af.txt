clearly highly effective, future work will have to resolve these
remaining mysteries.
At ﬁrst glance, the implications of our study for industry
seem clear. First, ISPs have a critical role to play as more
than 87% of the infections reside in their networks. Second,
walled garden notiﬁcations work and are feasible, even though
the actual usability of the notiﬁcation and cleanup advice
is currently rather poor. Third, since walled gardens are a
recognized best practice for ‘regular’ botnet mitigation by
ISPs, we can leverage the existing mitigation structures and
practices to also help mitigate IoT botnets, rather than having
to go through the time-consuming path of setting up new
organizational structures and agreements.
There is a ‘but’, however. A signiﬁcant one. The economic
incentives for ISPs to adopt walled garden solutions are rather
weak, as evidenced by the fact that only a fraction of the
ISPs currently have them. Setting up and operating a walled
garden, or operating any effective abuse management process
in general, is a cost center for the ISP. Further eroding the
incentives is the fear of customer pushback. Our analysis of
customer experiences did indeed uncover a small but vocal
minority that was angry or frustrated. Given the high cost of
customer acquisition in these saturated markets, this fear might
be enough to dissuade ISPs from quarantining infections. Over-
coming this incentive problem might require a governmental
measure to assign intermediate liability to ISPs. Soft versions
hereof – e.g., a so-called ‘duty of care’ – already exist in many
jurisdictions [10], [30]. While calling upon ISPs to take on this
task, we can point out that their actions will have much higher
13
chance of success than educating millions of end users about
IoT security. Also, we can point to the fact a non-trivial portion
of customers was pleased to be notiﬁed via the walled garden.
As more people will become aware of the threats to their IoT
devices, ISP mitigation might become more accepted – or even
expected.

this environment you can safely solve the security issues. We
are willing to help you to do so. What is the problem and how
can you solve it?
One or more Internet connected devices in your home have
been infected with the Mirai virus. We cannot detect which
Internet connected device has been infected. Most likely it is
a digital video recorder (DVR), security camera or a printer
connected to the Internet rather than a computer, laptop, tablet
or mobile phone.
What should you do to remove the Mirai virus and prevent
future infections? Please follow the steps below. If you cannot
complete a step, please proceed to the next one.
1. Determine which devices are connected to your Internet
connection. Reminder: The Mirai virus mainly infects Internet
connected devices such as a DVR, security camera or printer
connected to the Internet.
2. Change the password of the Internet connected devices.
Choose a password that is hard to guess. If you do not know
the current password, please refer to the manual.
By following these steps, you have prevented future infections.
3. Restart the Internet connected devices by turning it off and
on again. Hereafter, the Mirai virus has been removed from
the memory of the devices. Now that your Internet connected
devices are safe, the last steps are to protect your router/
modem.
4. Reset your modem/router
to the factory settings. On
https://address.com it is described how you do this for an
Experia Box.

Secure environment
A safe Internet is in everyones interest. We strongly care about
protecting your (conﬁdential) information.
We have received information from one of our partners that a
security issue has been detected on your Internet connection.
You probably have not noticed anything yet.
Dont worry. To protect you against the security risks we have
placed your Internet connection in our secure environment. In
this environment you can safely solve the security issues. We
are willing to help you to do so.
What is the problem and how can you solve it?
One or more devices connected to your Internet connections
are infected with the Mirai-virus. This virus targets devices
that make use of your Internet connection independently. In
most cases IP Cameras or Digital TV decoders.
The infection probably occurred due to the use of a standard
password username combination to access the device.
To solve this problem please reset all your devices to factory
defaults. After the reset change all the passwords for accessing
the devices to strong passwords.
In case the device can be reached by Telnet or SSH please
also change these passwords.
