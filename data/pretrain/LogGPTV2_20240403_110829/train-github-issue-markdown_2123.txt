When loading a model (tensorflow, darknet) to a myriad VPU, following happens
as I understood:
  1. OpenCV reads the model and converts it to the IE representation.
  2. The model will be transferred to the VPU.
  3. Ready to accept forward requests.
Is it possible to release the converted model from the RAM, because it is
already loaded into the VPUs RAM? Or did I misunderstand the whole concept?
Due to limited RAM on our execution nodes, we would like to reduce the memory
overhead required for bigger yolo networks.
Kind Regards
