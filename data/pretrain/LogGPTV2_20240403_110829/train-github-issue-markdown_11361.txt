(Updated - my first examples were wrong)
In the following example the document will be deleted:
    DELETE testidx
    PUT testidx
    PUT testidx/doc/_mapping
    {
      "_ttl":{
        "enabled": "true"
      }
    }
    GET testidx/_mapping
    PUT testidx/doc/_mapping
    {
      "_ttl":{
        "enabled": "false"
      }
    }
    # _ttl is enabled anyway
    GET testidx/_mapping
    POST testidx/doc/1
    {
      "text":"foo",
      "_ttl": "10ms"
    }
    #document will be deleted after a while
    GET testidx/doc/1
