The file below will compile (--target es5, --module commonjs, --jsx
"preserve") but not run, because the require statement is optimized away.
In the subsequent JSX translation, the `
` elements are translated to `React.createElement()` calls which are then no
longer possible.
    import React = require("react");
    export function render(): JSX.Element {
       return ();
    }
My current workaround is this:
    /* tslint:disable:no-unused-expressions */
    import React = require("react"); React
    /* tslint:enable:no-unused-expressions */
    export function render(): JSX.Element {
       return ();
    }
but that is rather cumbersome due to the tslint errors you will get.
Therefore, maybe not optimize React require away in case of .tsx?
