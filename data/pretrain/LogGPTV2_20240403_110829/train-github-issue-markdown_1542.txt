@BerkeleyTrue Made commit `b4417a4` which changes the last test in Diff Two
Arrays.
The instructions say:  
Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items not found in both of
the original arrays.
It doesn't say anything about duplicates. My working assumption (and the least
effort solution) is that duplicates should be retained. This is how the test
was originally written when @abhisekp submitted it.
The Test:  
`diff([1, 2, 3, 3], [1]), [2, 3, 3]`  
should return `[2, 3, 3]`
Here is my code:
    function diff(arr1, arr2) {
      var output = [];
      // Check arr2 for arr1's contents
      for(i=0;i<arr1.length;i++) {
        if(arr2.indexOf(arr1[i]) === -1) {
          output.push(arr1[i]); // Not found, throw it in the output
        }
      }
      // Check arr1 for arr2's contents
      for(i=0;i<arr2.length;i++) {
        if(arr1.indexOf(arr2[i]) === -1) {
          output.push(arr2[i]); // Not found, throw it in the output
        }
      }
      return output;
    }
    diff([1, 2, 3, 3], [1]);
