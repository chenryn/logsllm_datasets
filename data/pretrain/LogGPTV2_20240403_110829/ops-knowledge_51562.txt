User: I need to set an environment variable in Python and find the address in memory where it is located. Since it's on Linux, I don't mind about using libraries that only work consistently on Linux (if that's the only way). How would you do this?
Edit: The scope of the problem is as follows: I'm trying to hack a program for class, and essentially I'm putting my shellcode into an environment variable and then overwriting one byte on the victim code with the address of my environment variable. I need to find a way to automate this in Python, so my question is two-fold:

Is there a way to get the address in
memory of an environment variable?
Can this only be done in bash/C or
can I do it purely in Python?
Assistant: For accessing and setting environment variables, read up on the os.environ dictionary. You can also use os.putenv to set an environment variable.
