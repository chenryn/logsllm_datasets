source usage
The infrastructure required to host on-line games must also
account for the mutability of the games over time. Software
patches to ﬁx bugs, prevent cheats, and deliver new content
to end-users are an expected component of many on-line
games. These patches can vary greatly in size, from a few
bytes to several gigabytes. Understanding the impact of
these patches on hosting, and adequately provisioning for
them is an important part of supporting on-line games. We
use the trace of the Steam content delivery network to ex-
amine this aspect of games. Our Steam trace includes the
initial download of the popular FPS game Half-Life 2 as
well as a number of sizable content updates for both clients
and servers.
The Steam network is utilized for both player authenti-
cation and content distribution. Players are authenticated
to Steam for each game session, via the download of an au-
thentication module. Content is distributed to players (and

and 4, a much larger percentage of the IP addresses in the beverage com-
pany trace is resolvable. This is due to the fact that the trace (and the set of
IP addresses in it) is much older, giving services such as GeoBytes more
time to identify their locations

ble 4 shows, a signiﬁcant portion of the load is from outside
of North America. Using the resolved connections, the per-
continent load normalized by the mean connection arrival
rate was plotted. As Figure 13 shows, each continent shows
a predictable, diurnal pattern of activity with the only dif-
ference being a time-zone shift. It is interesting to note that
in contrast to the Half-Life aggregate load and international
beverage company web site load (Figure 12(c)), the per-
continent load of cs.mshmro.com exhibits a large vari-
ance similar to the North American web site loads shown
in Figures 12(a) and 12(b). We hypothesize that when the
usage patterns of international services are broken out into
individual regions, the resulting load variances are similar
to those of regional servers such as the cereal manufacturer
and the credit card company.
To test this hypothesis, we compared the per-continent
load between cs.mshmro.com and the international bev-

servers) via Steam at irregular intervals and irregular sizes.
These two functions are not distinguished in the data set
we have collected. However, we can differentiate them by
utilizing the GameSpy dataset, which tracks player load,
by assuming that player load and game authentication are
linearly correlated.
As a way of validating that the Steam data and the Game-
Spy data are tracking the same thing (i.e. player load), we
consider a week without a Steam update. Figure 15 shows
a scatter plot of Steam data (in megabits per second) versus
GameSpy data (in players), and the least-squares ﬁt line.
The correlation coefﬁcient for this week is 0.86, indicating
a roughly linear relationship. We attribute the inexact na-
ture of the correspondence to small changes in the size of
the authentication module and sampling error.
We use the GameSpy dataset to subtract the authentica-
tion data from Steam and focus on the bandwidth require-
ments of a patch. Figure 16 shows a two week period of
Steam activity, with a single patch occurring three days into
the period. Also graphed is the authentication data com-
ponent, computed from the GameSpy dataset with a ratio
of players to megabits/second of 1 to 0.0291. By integrat-
ing these two signals and subtracting, we estimate the patch
burden on Steam for this patch to be 129.7 terabytes, which
is 30% of that week’s total load including authentication.
We use this same methodology on four patches deliv-
ered during our trace, and chart the bandwidth impact of
the patches over a two-week period in Figure 17. Three
anomalies deserve explanation: patch p3 is cut short of the
full two week period analysis because of the release of p5,
patch p2 shows a rise in bandwidth after one week due to
erroneous player data from GameSpy, and (according to
Steam’s press releases) the two weeks of patch p7 contain
numerous patches. One question to address is how long it
Figure 15: Half-Life player population versus Steam CDN
usage
takes to deliver a patch: the cumulative distribution func-
tion (CDF) of the patch delivery data in Figure 18 shows
that 80% of the load occurs in the ﬁrst 72 hours for the three
single-patch traces, whereas the various patches in trace p7
are delivered throughout a two-week period.
Our observations on patch distribution bring up several
issues. We believe content delivery for games is a signiﬁ-
cant burden that must be provisioned for, as it can greatly
increase the hosting bandwidth requirement. At this point,
however, it is unclear what the optimal strategy would be
for delivery and scheduling. Our inital observations are
that to avoid the stacking effect seen in Figure 18, content
should be spaced for delivery such that the bulk of each
patch is delivered before the next patch begins. Further, if
minimizing the combined content and authentication load
is a goal, then patches should be released at the lowest peak

line game players and game usage data from a number of
unique sources, mostly biased towards the FPS genre. Our
results show that gamers are difﬁcult to satisfy throughout
the gameplay process: they are likely to leave and never re-
turn if they can’t connect, they are likely to leave within the
ﬁrst few minutes if they don’t enjoy the server’s character-
istics, and they are unlikely to become loyal to a server. In
addition, the popularity of this collection of games follows
a power-law distribution, with a small number of games
having orders of magnitude more players than the rest. This
makes resource provisioning very difﬁcult for the initial re-
lease of a game when popularity has not been established
and provides a promising area where shared hosting can
provide beneﬁt. Although initial provisioning is difﬁcult,
our results also show that once established, game work-
loads are relatively stable from week to week, allowing
game providers to more easily allocate resources to meet
demand. In addition, we determine that game workloads
are synchronized amongst themselves and other interactive
applications and that they follow strong diurnal, geographic
patterns. Such synchronization makes it difﬁcult to obtain
statistical multiplexing gain between games and other in-
teractive applications when using shared infrastructure. Fi-
nally, we show that game software updates provide a sig-
niﬁcant burden on game hosting and must be scheduled and
planned for accordingly.

6 Conclusions
On-line gaming is an increasingly popular form of enter-
tainment on the Internet. Unfortunately, effectively hosting
on-line games is a difﬁcult, expensive proposition made
more onerous by the lack of workload models for games
or known characteristics of gamers. Due to the unpre-
dictable nature of the popularity of a game, combined with
the high barrier to entry for hosting, a number of academic
and industry projects have focused on providing a shared
on-demand infrastructure to solve the hosting problem.
To understand the beneﬁts of such infrastructure, this pa-
per presents a comprehensive analysis of a collection of on-
