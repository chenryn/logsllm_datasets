Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-create-a-set-of-radio-
buttons has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and include links
to screenshots if possible.
When I visit challenge page, the HTML inside editor is rendered twice.

Notice there are two title CatPhotoApp.
This issue, however, is gone when click the `Run Code` button or press control
+ Enter.

Maybe there is something wrong with the onload/initial callback.
