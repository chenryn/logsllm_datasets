**ATT&CK ID:** T1556.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Pluggable Authentication Modules

Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to gain unauthorized access to user credentials or to enable unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system that consists of configuration files, libraries, and executable files, which collectively manage the authentication process for various services. The most commonly used authentication module is `pam_unix.so`, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information stored in the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.

By altering these modules, attackers can intercept or manipulate authentication data, thereby compromising the security of the system. This technique allows adversaries to bypass normal authentication mechanisms and gain access to protected resources.
