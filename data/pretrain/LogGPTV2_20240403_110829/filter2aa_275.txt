Introduction
• Why this talk?
•
Discussions of old “famous” hacker tales
•
Fake stories, lulz
•
Victims of computer bugs
•
Real situations from unexpected data
•
Are these scenarios realistic in today's tech 
environment?
•
Could someone exploit one of these scenarios for 
profit/lulz?

Mr. NULL
•
Null surname breaking computer systems
•
Trouble purchasing plane tickets
•
Skepticism?
•
Is this a one-off issue in a specific scenario or a global 
issue?
•
Would something like this cause a bug today?
•
How did this even cause an issue? 
•
NULL != “NULL”, Business logic issues?
http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160325-the-names-that-break-computer-systems
My crime is that of curiosity
My prediction
• I believe Mr. Null
•
Edge cases likely still exist
•
Data validation is a major issues
• Are there systems where we can provide 
similar data?
•
Would it trigger a bug?
•
Interesting outcome?
•
Profitable outcome?
Vanity License Plates
• US allows personalized license plates
•
Can’t be vulgar, sexual, negative, etc
•
Can’t misrepresent law enforcement
•
A-Z, 1-9, some symbols
Let’s register a plate!
‘NULL’ appears to be available
•
Registration went through fine, no bugs or 
anything
•
Surprised, don’t have high expectations regarding
DMV site
Uh… profit?
• Is it possible to be ‘invisible’ to citations?
• What happens when a police officer does a 
search for my plate ‘NULL’
•
would it not return any data? possibly error?
•
If they file a citation, would it cause an issue?
Time will tell...
Unforeseen Consequences
Vehicle Registration Renewal
• Time to renew registration
•
Let's use CA DMV site
•
Enter last five of VIN
•
Enter license plate
Got a citation...
• Parking ticket
•
Info documented on the citation
•
Looked up citation number in the citation 
processing company
•
Paid my citation like a sucker…
I guess my predictions were wrong…
You’ve got mail!
• Grip of envelopes in mailbox… wtf?
•
Citations… 
•
Wait, they’re addressed to me but they’re not for 
my car?
My prediction was very wrong…
Citation Processing Center
• A Private Company
•
.GOV contracts… they’re appear to be collection
•
Their site allows for citation look up via Plate / 
State…
Query: 
Plate: NULL
State: California
Citation Processing Center
• Contact
•
Their request:
•
Mail in all of the citations I received
•
show copies of my current vehicle registration.
•
Show a complete history of all of my vehicle 
registrations
•
My response:
•
Uhm, fuck off.
Citation Processing Center
Did they have malicious intent?
After our discussion…
Any lawyers?
• Do I have a legal footing?
•
They modified the data to make me look guilty
•
At this point I consider their entire database 
questionable…
•
Is this data synced with DMV? PD?
•
Do I have bench warrants for my arrest?
•
Will my license get suspended?
Potential for Misconduct
• Employees have write access
•
Disgruntled ex?
•
Can they be socially engineered to point citations 
at others?
•
Convinced citation was “off-by-one” / typo?
Poor Solutions
• LAPD
•
I don’t know
•
Change your plate
• DMV
•
We don’t deal with citations, only suspensions if 
requested
•
Change your plate
• CPC
•
Prove to us without a doubt that these hundreds 
of citations aren’t yours
•
Change your plate
Poor Solutions
• Surprisingly enough they responded to my 
tweet…
• Somehow reached out to CPC and got them 
to void out a bunch of citations
• This lowered my total amount due, but 
didn’t actually solve anything
Future Possibilities
CPC - Equivalent Issues
• Lack of data entry standards
• Other potential entries?
•
MISSING
•
NONE
•
NO TAGS
•
NO PLATE
