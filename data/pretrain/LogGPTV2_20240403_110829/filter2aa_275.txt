# Go NULL Yourself: How I Learned to Start Worrying While Getting Fined for Others' Auto Infractions

## Introduction
- **Who Am I?**
  - My name is Droogie.
  - I am a degenerate and a hacker working for IOActive.

- **Why This Talk?**
  - To discuss old, famous hacker tales.
  - To debunk fake stories and highlight the humor (lulz) in them.
  - To explore real situations arising from unexpected data.
  - To assess whether these scenarios are still realistic in today's technological environment.
  - To consider if someone could exploit these scenarios for profit or lulz.

## Observations

### License Plate Cameras
- **SQL Injection**
  - Injecting via a query in a license plate.
  - Initially met with skepticism, but it raises some valid points.
  
- **Palantir**
  - Palantir provides big data analytics and surveillance networks.
  - Internal manual: [Vice Article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kx4z8/revealed-this-is-palantirs-top-secret-user-manual-for-cops)
  - California privacy laws: [EFF Page](https://www.eff.org/pages/california-automated-license-plate-reader-policies)

- **FOIA (Freedom of Information Act)**
  - Grants the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency.
  - Nine exemptions that can block access to data.
  - Request electronic delivery: $0.10 per page, $1 per CD-ROM.
  - [FOIA Website](https://www.foia.gov/)

- **Seattle PD ALPR Database**
  - Contains all captured plate data for the Seattle area.
  - Includes OCR/Images/Location Details.
  - Some sensitive information is scrubbed, but not all.

- **Mr. NULL**
  - The surname "NULL" causing issues in computer systems.
  - Trouble purchasing plane tickets.
  - Skepticism: Is this a one-off issue or a global problem?
  - Would this cause a bug today?
  - Business logic issues: `NULL != “NULL”`?

- **My Prediction**
  - I believe Mr. NULL’s story.
  - Edge cases likely still exist.
  - Data validation is a major issue.
  - Are there systems where we can provide similar data to trigger a bug?
  - What would be the outcome? Interesting or profitable?

## Vanity License Plates
- **Personalized Plates in the US**
  - Allowed, but cannot be vulgar, sexual, negative, or misrepresent law enforcement.
  - Characters: A-Z, 1-9, some symbols.

- **Registering 'NULL'**
  - Registration went through without any bugs.
  - Surprised, given low expectations for DMV sites.

- **Profit?**
  - Is it possible to be 'invisible' to citations?
  - What happens when a police officer searches for my plate 'NULL'?
  - Would it return no data or an error?
  - If they file a citation, would it cause an issue?

- **Time Will Tell...**

## Unforeseen Consequences

### Vehicle Registration Renewal
- **Renewal Process**
  - Used the CA DMV site.
  - Entered the last five digits of the VIN and the license plate.
  - Received a parking ticket.

### Citation Processing Center
- **Citations in the Mail**
  - Received multiple envelopes with citations.
  - Citations addressed to me but not for my car.
  - Contacted the CPC.
  - Their request:
    - Mail in all received citations.
    - Show copies of current vehicle registration.
    - Provide a complete history of all vehicle registrations.
  - My response: "Uhm, fuck off."

- **Legal Concerns**
  - Do I have a legal footing?
  - They modified the data to make me look guilty.
  - Entire database questionable.
  - Is this data synced with DMV or PD?
  - Bench warrants for my arrest?
  - Will my license get suspended?

- **Potential for Misconduct**
  - Employees have write access.
  - Disgruntled ex-employees?
  - Can they be socially engineered to point citations at others?
  - Convincing citation was "off-by-one" or a typo?

### Poor Solutions
- **LAPD**
  - Suggested changing the plate.
- **DMV**
  - Doesn’t deal with citations, only suspensions if requested.
  - Suggested changing the plate.
- **CPC**
  - Prove without a doubt that the hundreds of citations aren’t yours.
  - Suggested changing the plate.

- **Social Media Response**
  - Responded to my tweet.
  - Voided some citations, reducing the total amount due but not solving the issue.

## Future Possibilities
- **CPC - Equivalent Issues**
  - Lack of data entry standards.
  - Other potential entries: MISSING, NONE, NO TAGS, NO PLATE.
  - [LA Times Article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-23-vw-20054-story.html)

- **Seattle PD ALPR Database**
  - OCR reads various things: sides of vehicles, buildings, road signs.
  - Interesting patterns in the database.

## Summary / Questions / Similar Stories
- **Current Status**
  - Still periodically receive tickets in the mail.
  - Still have the 'NULL' plate.
  - Total currently due: $6,262.00.
