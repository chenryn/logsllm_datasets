User: I'm a beginner in Python and from a shell scripting background. I have learned shutil and also subprocess to create files/directories.
My question is, which one is better and recommended way of manage files in my OS(Linux/Windows) ? I read some Python books that discourage the use of OS commands to do so. 
I'm comfortable with Linux and mostly work in Linux environments, I have a very high tendency to use rm, mkdir, cp commands to manage files. Are there problems/benefits of using one over the other?
Assistant: I'll try to complement this after I go home, but just to begin I'll tell an example code I had wrote yesterday.
You can try it yourself though.

I had made 100k copies from an empty file with shutil and with subprocess.call, using the command time to get the execution time.
The result was worse than I expected.
shutil has taken 7 seconds.
subprocess has taken 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
Depending on how you use subprocess, you can allow code injection... by configuration files or user input.
Compatibility issues. Shutil already handle it for you.
