### Malicious Domains and Subnet Resolution

Malicious domains are significantly more likely to resolve to multiple subnets over time compared to legitimate domains. Up to 90% of malicious domains resolve to a greater number of distinct subnets than their legitimate counterparts. Conversely, examining the distribution of malicious typosquatting domains across IP subnets reveals that the 13,526 malicious typosquatting domains identified in our study resolved to only 2,377 unique IP addresses. This means, on average, each IP address hosts approximately 5.7 typosquatting domains. In practice, however, a small subset of IP addresses hosts a large fraction of these typosquatting pages. Specifically, the four subnets listed in Table III collectively host 36% of all malicious typosquatting pages and 50% of all visited malicious typosquatting domains. The table also identifies the autonomous system (AS) owners for these subnets, with the exception of Castle Access, which operates enterprise data centers, all other companies are involved in the domain parking business.

### Registrar Statistics

Using collected WHOIS records, we analyzed the most commonly used registrars for both legitimate and malicious domain registrations. As expected, the most popular registrars also have the highest number of malicious domain registrations. Unfortunately, we do not have comprehensive data on the total number of domain registrations for each registrar, nor have we examined enough domains to make statistically significant claims about whether specific registrars are disproportionately used for malicious purposes.

Our data does show, however, that some registrars have a significantly higher ratio of legitimate to malicious registrations. These include reputable registrars such as Safenames and Corporation Service Company (CSC), which market themselves as brand protection or corporate domain portfolio management companies. Interestingly, Network Solutions also has a high ratio of legitimate to malicious domains, despite no evidence suggesting it has a better reputation or positions itself as a brand protection specialist. We hypothesize this is due to its historical role as the registry for .com, .org, and .net zones, and later as the sole domain registrar for these TLDs until 1998. Our data indicates that the legitimate domains registered through Network Solutions are primarily high-profile domains with 2 to 5 characters, registered in the 1990s.

We posit that the reason for these results is that the total set of typosquatting domains for any given authoritative site is spread among many typosquatters. Since each typosquatter can choose a different registrar, there is a dilution of malicious activity across the most popular registrars. Conversely, when a legitimate company uses a brand protection service, all defensive domain registrations are likely to be done through the same registrar, leading to clustering of legitimate registrations and diffusion of malicious ones.

### Influence of Authoritative Domain Type

To determine whether typosquatters target all popular domains indiscriminately or focus on certain types of authoritative domains, we classified our list of authoritative domains into content-based categories. This classification was done manually, with the assistance of Trend Micro’s Site Safety Center and McAfee’s Threat Intelligence services. Figure 10 shows the typosquatting saturation for these authoritative categories and illustrates the relative contribution of the most important malicious typosquatting categories to the overall saturation. Our data indicates no significant change in typosquatting saturation over time, so we present an average over the period. Categories with fewer than 10 domains were excluded to ensure representativeness.

From the figure, it is evident that adult sites are the most targeted, with adult typosquatting domains specifically targeting adult authoritative domains more frequently than other types. Social networking sites come second, also experiencing some adult typosquatting, primarily due to the typosquatting domains of odnoklassniki.ru and renren.com. There are substantial differences in the contribution of affiliate abuse or scam typosquatting domains across different authoritative categories. It would be incorrect to attribute these differences solely to the likelihood of certain categories (e.g., marketplace and shopping) offering affiliate programs, as typosquatting sites in the affiliate abuse category often exploit programs of unrelated domains. Therefore, we cannot pinpoint a specific reason for the observed differences based on our data.

### Influence of Top-Level Domains (TLDs)

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinates the global domain name system but delegates the management of top-level domains (TLDs) to commercial or non-profit organizations known as registry operators. This applies to both generic TLDs (.com, .org, .net, etc.) and country-code TLDs (.de, .jp, etc.). Registry operators may also act as registrars or delegate this responsibility to other companies. Registrars must be officially accredited by ICANN to do business directly with a registry operator, while non-ICANN-accredited registrars can only be resellers for other registrars. For generic TLDs, all accredited registrars have adopted the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP), which allows an official domain dispute panel to take down or transfer ownership of a domain if a third party can prove the registration violates their rights. This policy aims to reduce cybersquatting by providing an out-of-court resolution mechanism.

While the UDRP is applied to all generic TLDs, not all country-code TLDs follow the same approach. Some country-code TLD registry operators have implemented their own similar out-of-court dispute resolution processes, while others require an official court ruling. This can influence the prevalence of typosquatting in those TLDs. TLDs with swift, out-of-court procedures for domain disputes are expected to have fewer typosquatting domains.

Local domain authorities also influence typosquatting through price setting. Typosquatting is only profitable if the revenue from a domain exceeds its cost. Therefore, more expensive TLDs are likely to attract fewer typosquatters. Additionally, some country-code registry operators impose restrictions on registrants, such as requiring citizenship or a local correspondence address, making it more difficult or impossible for foreign parties to register domains under those TLDs.

Figure 11 shows the typosquatting saturation per TLD for TLDs with at least 5 domains in our top 500 list. The saturation does not change significantly over time, so we present an average. The different bar patterns indicate the type of dispute arbitration provided: "Court" (no out-of-court arbitration), "UDRP" (adopted the UDRP), and "Custom" (implements a custom form of out-of-court arbitration). The two TLDs without out-of-court arbitration options have the highest typosquatting saturation. On the other hand, the Brazilian (.br) and Japanese (.jp) TLDs have significantly lower typosquatting saturation, likely due to their higher domain costs. We calculated the yearly price of a domain under these TLDs by averaging the prices advertised by the top 3 global domain registrars (GoDaddy, eNom, and Network Solutions) and found that a .com.br domain costs $43 and a .jp domain costs $107, while domains under other TLDs shown in Figure 11 sell for less than $15. These higher domain prices effectively deter typosquatters. Based on the steep drop in typosquatting saturation between .br and .jp domains, we estimate the annual revenue of a typosquatting domain of a popular website to be between $43 and $107. However, since there are still many cheap TLDs available, there is little incentive for typosquatters to target more expensive TLDs, suggesting the actual annual revenue might be higher.

### Related Work

To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the problem of typosquatting over time using a content-based approach. Previous research on typosquatting typically focused on snapshots of the problem or limited longitudinal studies to domain registration records. Our work complements this prior research by providing a deeper understanding of typosquatting abuse and revealing trends that might otherwise remain hidden.

#### Cybersquatting

Cybersquatting refers to the registration of domains that include trademarks belonging to other persons or companies. This practice was prevalent in the early 1990s when many brick-and-mortar companies had not yet established online presences. Opportunists registered these trademarks as domain names to sell them back to the rightful owners for profit. Today, cybersquatting is less common, as companies typically register appropriate domains well in advance. However, opportunists still try to speculate on future product and service names and register them before the companies can. This phenomenon has been studied by Coull et al. [5] in the context of other domain registration abuses, such as domain-name front running.

#### Typosquatting

Typosquatting evolved from cyposquatting and involves registering domains that are mistypes of popular authoritative domains to capture traffic from users who mistype URLs. This practice dates back over 15 years, with the 1999 Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) already addressing URLs "sufficiently similar to a trademark of a person or entity" [1].

In 2003, Edelman reported on thousands of mistyped and cybersquatting domains serving sexually-explicit content, likely registered by the same individual [8]. Wang et al. [25] later described a system for automatically discovering and analyzing typosquatting by simulating typing errors. They noted that most discovered typosquatting domains pointed to companies specializing in domain parking, which served ads related to the mistyped domain name. In our study, we used Wang et al.’s models to generate typosquatting domains for a seven-month period.

Banerjee et al. [2] showed that typosquatting extends beyond the models of Wang et al., including the abuse of domain suffixes, such as typosquatting .org domains for equivalent .com authoritative ones. Although they collected data over two months, they did not perform a longitudinal study.

Halvorson et al. [12] recently found that over three-quarters of domains registered with the .xxx TLD are defensive registrations, where companies and individuals preemptively register their trademarks with the .xxx extension to prevent potential harm to their image.

Moore and Edelman [16] conducted a similar study in 2010, estimating that approximately one million typosquatting domains targeted the top 3,264 .com sites. They also highlighted that large advertising networks often cooperate with typosquatters.
