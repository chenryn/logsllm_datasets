that malicious domains are much more likely to resolve to
more than one subnet over time than legitimate domains. For
up to 90% of all domains, malicious domains resolve to more
distinct subnets over time than legitimate domains.
Conversely, we can also look at the number of malicious
typosquatting domains per IP subnet. The 13,526 malicious
typosquatting domains discovered during our study resolve
to only 2,377 distinct IP addresses, which means that on
average each of them hosts 5.7 typosquatting domains. In
practice, however, a much smaller range of IP addresses hosts
a very large fraction of the typosquatting pages:
the four
subnets shown in Table III together host 36% of all malicious
typosquatting pages and 50% of all malicious typosquatting
domains visited during the study. The table also shows the
owner of the autonomous system corresponding to each net-
work. Except for Castle Access, which operates enterprise data
centers, each of these companies is in the domain parking
business.
I. Registrar statistics
Based on our collected WHOIS records, we investigated
the most commonly used registrars for both legitimate and
malicious domain registrations. Ranking the registrars by their
number of malicious typosquatting domain registrations shows,
unsurprisingly, that the overall most popular registrars also
have the most malicious domain registrations. Unfortunately,
we do not know the total number of domain registrations for
each of the encountered registrars, nor have we investigated
enough domains to make statistically signiﬁcant claims about
whether or not particular registrars are used more often than
others for malicious registrations.
Nonetheless, our data does show that some registrars have
a signiﬁcantly higher ratio of legitimate to malicious registra-
tions than others. These are mostly reputable registrars that
explicitly market themselves as brand protection or corporate
domain portfolio management companies, such as Safenames
and Corporation Service Company (CSC). However, we also
found the company Network Solutions to have a high ratio
of legitimate to malicious domains in our study, even though
we could not ﬁnd any evidence that this company has a better

than average reputation6, nor that it positions itself as a brand
protection specialist. We suspect many legitimate domains are
registered through this company because of its historic role,
ﬁrst as registry for the .com, .org and .net zones and later
as the sole domain registrar for these TLDs, until ’98. Our data
indeed indicates that their legitimate domains are mostly high-
proﬁle domains with a length of 2 to 5 characters, registered
in the 1990’s.
We posit that the reason for these results is that the total
set of typosquatting domains for any given authoritative site is
spread among many typosquatters, a claim which is supported
by our WHOIS data. Since each typosquatter can opt for
a different registrar, there is a dilution of malicious activity
over the most popular registrars. On the other hand, when
a legitimate company uses a brand protection service, all
defensive domain registrations are likely to be done through
the same registrar. As such, the legitimate registrations will
tend to cluster, while the malicious registrations will tend to
get diffused.
J.
Inﬂuence of Authoritative Domain Type
To see whether typosquatters indiscriminately target all
popular domains, or rather target certain kinds of author-
itative domains more often than others, we classiﬁed our
list of authoritative domains into content-based categories.
This classiﬁcation was done manually, with the assistance
of Trend Micro’s Site Safety Center7 and McAfee’s Threat
Intelligence8 domain categorization services. Fig. 10 shows the
typosquatting saturation for these authoritative categories and
also illustrates the relative contribution of the most important
malicious typosquatting categories to the saturation. Since
our data indicates no signiﬁcant change of the typosquatting

an averaging over time. In order for the results to be represen-
tative, authoritative categories containing less than 10 domains
have been excluded.
We can see from the ﬁgure that adult sites are targeted
the most and that adult typosquatting domains are clearly
targeting adult authoritative domains more often than other
types of authoritative domains. The social networking cat-
egory comes second and also experiences some adult
ty-
posquatting, caused mainly by the typosquatting domains of
odnoklassniki.ru and renren.com. There are also
substantial differences in the contribution of the afﬁliate abuse
or scam typosquatting domains between the different authorita-
tive categories. It would be wrong to attribute these differences
to the fact that some authoritative categories (e.g. marketplace
and shopping) are more likely to offer an afﬁliate program
than others, because a typosquatting site in the afﬁliate abuse
category does not necessarily exploit an afﬁliate program of
its own authoritative site. In fact, we saw many cases of
typosquatting domains exploiting an afﬁliate program of an
unrelated domain during our manual classiﬁcation. Hence,
we cannot pinpoint a speciﬁc reason for this difference in
the contribution of the afﬁliate abuse or scam typosquatting
domains between the different authoritative categories based
on our data.
K. Inﬂuence of TLD
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Num-
bers (ICANN) is responsible for coordinating the global do-
main name system, but has delegated the responsibility of
managing top-level domains to other commercial or non-
proﬁt organizations, known as registry operators. This is true
for generic TLDs (.com, .org, .net, etc.) as well as for
country-code TLDs (.de, .jp, etc.). These registry operators
may also fulﬁll the role of registrar, or may delegate this
responsibility to other companies. A registrar must be ofﬁcially
accredited by ICANN for it to directly do business with a
registry operator, while non-ICANN-accredited registrars can
only be resellers for other registrars. For the generic TLDs, all
accredited registrars have adopted the Uniform Domain-Name
Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) [14]. This is a policy to
be agreed between a registrar and a registrant for a domain
name registration, giving an ofﬁcial domain dispute panel the
right to take down or transfer ownership of the domain in case
a third party complainant can prove the registration violates
her rights. The goal of this policy is to reduce the prevalence
of cybersquatting by saving the complainant from having to
start an expensive court procedure in order to take down the
domain.
While this policy is being applied for all generic TLDs,
not all country-code TLDs follow the same approach. Some
country-code TLD registry operators that do not implement
the UDRP have decided to implement their own similar out-
of-court domain dispute resolution, but others only intervene
in disputed registrations after an ofﬁcial court ruling. This can
potentially have an inﬂuence on the prevalence of typosquat-
ting in those TLDs. In particular, we can expect that TLDs
providing a swift, out-of-court procedure for domain disputes
have fewer typosquatting domains than those that do not.
Fig. 11. The typosquatting saturation per TLD, for those TLDs with at least 5
domains in our top 500 list. The different patterns indicate the type of dispute
arbitration provided.
A second way in which local domain authorities have an
inﬂuence on the prevalence of typosquatting, is in their price
setting. Obviously typosquatting can only be proﬁtable if the
revenue from a domain name is greater than its cost. Hence, we
can expect more expensive TLDs to attract less typosquatters
than cheaper TLDs.
A ﬁnal policy component
that can have an effect on
typosquatting, is the restrictions placed by registry operators
on registrants that can apply for a domain name. For instance,
some country-code registry operators require registrants to be
a citizen of the corresponding country or to have a local
correspondence address. This makes it more difﬁcult (and
hence more expensive) or even impossible for foreign parties
to legally register a domain name under those TLDs, hence
potentially lowering their attractiveness for typosquatters.
Fig. 11 shows the typosquatting saturation per TLD, for
the TLDs with at least 5 domains in our top 500 list. The
typosquatting saturation per TLD does not change signiﬁcantly
over time, hence we show an averaging over time. The different
bar patterns in the ﬁgure indicate the type of dispute arbitration
provided by the corresponding TLD authority. “Court” means
the authority provides no out-of-court arbitration whatsoever,
“UDRP” means the authority has adopted the UDRP and
“Custom” means the authority implements some custom form
of out-of-court arbitration. We can see that the two TLDs
without an out-of-court arbitration option have the highest
typosquatting saturation.
On the other side of the scale, the Brazilian TLD and espe-
cially the Japanese TLD have a signiﬁcantly lower typosquat-
ting saturation. Since we did not ﬁnd any evidence to indicate
that domain names under these TLDs are particularly difﬁcult
to obtain, we believe the scarcity of typosquatting domains for
these TLDs can be attributed to the high cost of acquiring such
domains. We calculated the yearly price of a domain under
these TLDs by averaging the yearly price advertised by the
global top 3 domain registrars9 GoDaddy, eNom and Network
Solutions, and found that a .com.br domain costs $43 and a
.jp domain costs $107, while domains under all other TLDs
shown in Fig. 11 sell for less than $15. Clearly, these higher
domain prices are effective at deterring typosquatters. Based
on the steep drop in typosquatting saturation between the .br
and .jp domains, we can estimate the annual revenue of a
typosquatting domain of a popular website to be somewhere
between $43 and $107. However, since there are still plenty

incentive for typosquatters to target the more expensive TLDs,
hence the annual revenue might actually be higher.
IV. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst content-
based study that examines the problem of typosquatting in
time. Prior work on typosquatting almost always operated by
taking a snapshot of the typosquatting problem and charac-
terizing that snapshot, or by limiting the longitudinal aspect
of the study to domain registration records only. Our work is
complementary to this type of prior work because it adds to the
understanding of typosquatting abuse and reveals trends that
otherwise remain hidden. In this section we review prior work
on typosquatting as well as other types of domain squatting
attacks.
Cybersquatting: Cybersquatting refers to the registration
of domains that include trademarks belonging to other per-
sons and companies. Cybersquatting was popular in the early
nineties, when long-existing brick-and-mortar companies did
not yet operate websites. Various opportunists registered their
trademarks as domain names before them, so that they would
sell the domains back to their rightful owners for proﬁt [11].
Today, this type of domain squatting is not as popular,
since companies usually register all appropriate domains well
before the company and its trademarks become popular. There
are, however, still cases where opportunists try to speculate
the name of future products and services and register them,
before the company marketing the product or service gets a
chance to.10 This phenomenon has been studied by Coull et
al. [5] together with other domain registration abuses, such as
domain-name front running.
Typosquatting: Cybersquatting evolved into typosquatting,
i.e., the act of registering domains that are mistypes of popular
authoritative domains, with the intention of capturing the trafﬁc
of users who mistype URLs in their browser address bar. This
practice can be traced back to over 15 years, since the 1999
Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) already
mentioned URLs that are “sufﬁciently similar to a trademark
of a person or entity” [1].
Edelman, in 2003, reported on thousands of mistyped and
cybersquatting domains that served sexually-explicit content,
which were likely registered by the same individual [8].
Wang et al. [25] later described a system for automatically
discovering and analyzing typosquatting by simulating typing
errors. The researchers also brought attention to the fact that
the majority of the discovered typosquatting domains were
pointing to companies specializing in domain parking, which
were used to automatically serve ads related to the mistyped
domain name. In this paper, we used Wang et al.’s models
to generate typosquatting domains for our seven-month long
study.
Banerjee et al. [2] showed that
typosquatting extends
beyond the models of Wang et al., including the abuse of
domain sufﬁxes, such as typosquatting .org domains, for the
equivalent .com authoritative ones. Even though the authors
have collected typosquatting data over a two-month period,
10Parked domain with ads - www.iphone9.com
they do not perform a longitudinal study and thus do not
include the parameter of time in their reported results.
Halvorson et al. [12] recently showed that over three
quarters of the domains registered with the .xxx TLD are
defensive registrations where companies and individuals pre-
emptively register their trademarks with the .xxx extension,
e.g., obama.xxx and president.xxx, out of fear that
someone could, in the future, use these domains to harm their
image.
Moore and Edelman performed a similar study for discov-
ering typosquatting domains in 2010 [16] and estimated that
approximately one million typosquatting domains targeted the
top 3,264 .com sites. The authors also bring attention to the
fact that large advertising networks willingly cooperate with ty-
