### Optimized Text

The ready-to-execute instructions are delayed in their dispatch. Conversely, the advantage of dispatching not-ready critical instructions to the Ready Instruction Queue (RIQ) diminishes with an extremely small RIQ. Figure 8(a)-(c) illustrates the normalized throughput Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), harmonic IPC, and Instruction Queue (IQ) Soft Error Rate (SER) relative to the baseline case for various RIQ sizes. As shown, IQ SER decreases as the RIQ size increases, because the unprotected Not-Ready Instruction Queue (NIQ) size is reduced, thereby exposing fewer vulnerable bits to soft errors. However, this comes at the cost of a performance penalty due to the NIQ's need to hold ready-to-execute instructions. Figure 8 indicates that an RIQ size of 24 entries provides the closest performance to the baseline across all three workload categories while also improving IQ reliability. After setting the RIQ size to 24, experiments can be conducted to determine an appropriate criticality threshold. A higher criticality threshold, however, requires a smaller RIQ, which increases IQ vulnerability, making it unsuitable even though it may improve performance. In our study, an RIQ with 24 entries and a pre-set criticality threshold of two is used.

### 5.3. Effectiveness of Dual-VDD in ROB SER Robustness

This subsection evaluates the efficiency of applying Dual-VDD for Register-Order Buffer (ROB) SER enhancement. The black bars in Figures 9(a) and (b) show the reduction in ROB SER and the power overhead of the processor core after implementing the proposed technique on three types of workloads. On average, ROB SER is reduced by 29% with an additional 2.6% core power consumption. For Memory (MEM) workloads, which experience a high number of L2 misses, the technique achieves a 43% reduction in ROB SER. Typically, a 2.6% power overhead exceeds the acceptable limit; thus, using L2 misses as a trigger needs improvement. It is important to note that the number of vulnerable bits in the ROB is not always proportional to ROB utilization, indicating that L2 misses do not necessarily imply a large number of ACE (Application Critical Execution) bits in the ROB.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced trigger that considers the quantity of ACE bits in the ROB. The trigger operates as follows: when an L2 miss occurs, the number of ACE bits in the ROB per cycle is counted and averaged over the next 20 cycles. High VDD is not supplied if the number of ACE bits is below a vulnerability threshold. Once the L2 miss is resolved, VDD is switched back to its nominal value. Since online, accurate ACE bit identification is challenging, we approximate the number of ACE bits at the instruction level. The basic idea is that the longer the dependence chain of an instruction, the higher the likelihood that its computation result will affect the program's final output. Therefore, we assume that bits in instructions with high criticality (e.g., criticality > 16) are ACE. The information stored in the critical table can be used for ACE-ness estimation.

### 5.4. Putting Them Together

Figures 7 and 9 demonstrate that both the hybrid radiation-hardened IQ and the Dual-VDD-based ROB exhibit strong SER robustness with minimal performance and power overhead. We apply these two techniques simultaneously and evaluate their combined effect on the entire processor core SER. The impact of the proposed techniques on the vulnerability of other primary structures, such as register files, load store queue, DTLB, and function units, is also examined. Note that caches and memory are excluded as they can be easily protected by ECC. The normalized SER results (relative to the baseline case where no optimization is applied) are shown in Figure 11. On average, the core SER is substantially reduced by 20%, while the SERs of other structures are only slightly affected. Additionally, the load store queue vulnerability is reduced by 15%.

We exclude a discussion of the performance penalty and power overhead for the aggregated technique as they have already been discussed in previous sections.

### 6. Related Work

Various methodologies have been proposed to model and tolerate soft errors at the architectural level. Li and Adve [7] estimated reliability using a probabilistic model of the error generation and propagation process in a processor. Fu et al. [28] studied microarchitecture vulnerability phase behavior. Sridharan et al. [29] examined the vulnerability contribution of instructions that are in-flight during long-stall instructions. Gomaa and Vijaykumar [30] proposed performing redundant execution only during low ILP and L2 misses to achieve high error coverage with minimal performance loss. SlicK [31] was introduced to avoid redundancy on results-predictable instructions. Wang et al. [32] showed that soft errors produce observable symptoms, which can trigger rollback execution. Walcott et al. [33] used processor metrics to predict dynamic vulnerability behavior and enable/disable Redundant Multithreading (RMT) execution. Soundararajan et al. [34] proposed dispatching stalls and PRT to control ROB vulnerability under a certain threshold at the cycle level. Our techniques are orthogonal to these approaches, as they improve the structures' soft-error robustness and reduce RMT/PRT trigger frequency and execution overhead. At the circuit level, Choudhury et al. [3] proposed using gate size and VDD as design parameters for SER robustness. Cazeaux et al. [36] selectively resized the most vulnerable gates to improve combination logic circuit single-event upset robustness. Our approach uniquely combines circuit and microarchitecture-level SER robustness techniques. DICE [37] is another radiation hardening design, but its area and power overheads are significant. We use rSRAM to build the RIQ due to its negligible area and power penalties, successfully handling write latency and overcoming performance, area, and power overhead issues.

### 7. Conclusions

In this paper, we proposed a hybrid radiation-hardened IQ design that dispatches performance-critical but not-ready instructions into a well-protected RIQ, while the unprotected NIQ holds only operand-ready instructions. This design leverages the RIQ's SER robustness to protect critical instructions and provide a time-of-issue guarantee. Results show an 80% IQ SER reduction with only a 0.3% throughput IPC and 1% harmonic IPC penalty. To improve ROB reliability, we proposed using architectural characteristics to trigger Dual-VDD and switch to a higher VDD level when the ROB exhibits high vulnerability during L2 misses. This technique achieves a 20% ROB SER reduction with a 1.4% power overhead. When combined, the two techniques reduce the core SER by 20%, with a 15% SER reduction in the load store queue as a byproduct.
