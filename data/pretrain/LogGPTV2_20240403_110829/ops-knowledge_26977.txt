User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some running logs
 0 20:11:09 INFO Running task 0.0 in stage 28.0 (TID 1280)
 1 20:11:10 INFO Running task 11.0 in stage 29.0 (TID 1331)
 2 20:10:58 INFO Finished task 84.0 in stage 24.0 (TID 1141). 2364 bytes result sent to driver
 3 20:10:55 INFO Running task 3.0 in stage 18.0 (TID 758)
 4 20:10:54 INFO Finished task 3.0 in stage 10.0 (TID 438). 2087 bytes result sent to driver
 5 20:11:10 INFO Finished task 1.0 in stage 28.0 (TID 1281). 2087 bytes result sent to driver
 6 20:10:54 INFO Finished task 0.0 in stage 8.0 (TID 321). 2141 bytes result sent to driver
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi)
B: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Changing view acls to: <*>
C: Running task <*> in stage <*> (TID <*>) 和 Finished task <*> in stage <*> (TID <*>). <*> bytes result sent to driver
D: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Starting remoting

Assistant: Answer: C
