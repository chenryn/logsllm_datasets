State of the Hack: Maltego Use Cases 
Over the past several years, data has quickly gone from being sparsely collected to hoarded in mounds, locked away in 
datacenters and spread across the world. Is there really a need to store so much information? That question has yet to be 
answered, but with advances in modern technology, it is relatively cheap to store every byte just in case it is needed later. 
Like other industries that collect data, the information security and threat intelligence industries are no exception. The 
issue with large stores of data comes in making sense of it all. How does one sift through terabytes of domains, IP 
addresses, malware strings, assembly code and netflows to find the one indicator driving the next attack? In this week's 
State of the Hack article, iDefense will cover a process best described as visual data analytics, which is a way to visualize 
data during analysis to find what data is most critical. 
Problem Highlight 
Security analysts often observe attacks as they are happening or shortly after they have occurred. It is up to analysts to 
identify the “who” and “why” of an attack based on the indicators collected. These indicators not only range in type but 
also in confidence level, as analysts collect and store some indicators based on tangential relationships. To provide the 
best possible intelligence, data collected from each malicious file, attack, public database and threat feed is stored in a 
single database that makes connections between the data. 
At present, databases holding indicator information hold upward of billions of records. When analysts quickly assemble all 
of the information about an attack and its related infrastructure, it becomes difficult to find the most meaningful data when 
querying data collections this large. Assume for a moment that a query is fast and an analyst is able to obtain the results 
he or she requested. Even in some cases, results come back with thousands of related indicators that may or may not be 
related to the overarching incident.  
Beyond collecting all the important indicators about a particular attack, analysts need to structure their results and 
analysis so that users can easily follow that analyst’s conclusions. This process of creating a visual of data is both an art 
and an engineering feat. An analyst must choose a medium and style that will most effectively display that data between 
the plotting of important data and its relevant connections, and the space in which it is represented. For example, 
representing several domains and passive IP address associations in a three-dimensional space is not going to work for a 
report meant to be sent out via e-mail or printed offline. Dealing with such limitations further increases when attempting to 
show highly connected data or data that is important but several layers outside the starting indicator.  
Solution 
One of the largest benefits of looking at visualized data is that it provides viewers with the ability to tap directly into the 
mind of an analyst. Technological tools are excellent, but nothing compares to the human mind and its ability to identify 
patterns within milliseconds of seeing a well-developed visual aid. It is for this reason that iDefense engineers have 
chosen to use Maltego, a visualization framework capable of taking custom data feeds and turning them into well-
connected graphs, as a visual platform for doing analysis. Maltego allows a user to specify transforms, which are bits of 
custom code that run locally or on a server, that can take the supplied input, frame it into a query and then return results 
to the user in the form of visual connections inside a graph. 
Using a visualization platform when doing analysis provides three advantages over the traditional method of taking notes. 
First, a visual platform capable of processing independent data feeds is quickly able to assemble, deduplicate and show 
associations among data. Second, no matter what the task, if the results of the analysis are worthwhile, an analyst will 
need to convert them into some type graph for others to visualize the data. By using a visualization platform during the 
analysis process, an analyst saves time, as the platform will build a visual while the analyst is conducting the research 
rather than after having conducted the research. Finally, because an analyst can see the data as a visualization platform 
is plotting it, he or she can quickly use his or her experience to filter or dismiss faulty results—something that could take 
hours to determine without visuals.  
Case Study: itsec.eicp.net Infrastructure and Malware Connections 
On Feb. 21, 2013, iDefense identified a password-protected PDF document named "Mandiant_APT2_Report.pdf" that 
was attempting to pass as a second iteration of Mandiant’s APT1 report released just days earlier. Upon entering this 
document's associated password, the document would install known cyber espionage malware on the victim computer 
observed back in November 2012. 
The malicious payload used the domain “itsec.eicp.net” for command and control (C&C). eicp.net is a dynamic domain 
name system (DNS) domain owned by the Shanghai Best Oray Information S&T Company (上海贝锐信息科技有限公司). 
A quick look at the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in iDefense’s passive DNS data resources shows that this domain
