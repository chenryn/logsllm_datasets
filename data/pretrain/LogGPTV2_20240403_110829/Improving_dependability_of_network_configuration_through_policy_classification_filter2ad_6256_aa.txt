## Abstract

As networks evolve over time, multiple operators modify their configurations without fully considering previous changes. This leads to redundant and obsolete policies, resulting in a complex and disorganized configuration that increases maintenance costs and operator errors. We introduce NetPiler, a method that discovers shared features among policies and groups them, thereby removing redundancies and simplifying the configuration while preserving the intended behavior. We applied NetPiler to routing policy configurations from four different networks, reducing more than 50% of BGP communities and related commands. Additionally, we demonstrate that the reduced community definitions are sufficient to handle network changes over nearly two years.

## 1. Introduction

Network configuration is a low-level, device-specific task involving the configuration of each device separately. With hundreds of devices, each with thousands of commands, even minor changes require careful attention to avoid affecting other devices or the entire network. As networks evolve, old configurations and temporary patches remain, complicating the overall configuration. Multiple operators with different backgrounds and working styles further contribute to this complexity. Merging networks and the variability in achieving high-level goals through different configurations also degrade the quality of network configurations over time.

As a result, companies spend a significant portion of their IT budgets on maintaining current operating environments. One study found that 80% of IT budgets in enterprise networks are used for maintenance [1]. Scheduled maintenance and upgrades account for more than 30% of network outages in Tier-1 ISPs [2], and operator errors can cause more than 50% of failures in computer systems and networks [3][4].

NetPiler, our system, transforms network configurations into a more manageable form by extracting underlying functions and dependencies, reducing redundancy, and generating a new, concise configuration. We apply NetPiler to inter-domain routing policy configurations and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing up to 70% of commands. We also show how such simplification improves manageability and discuss potential improvements to the algorithm.

## 2. Related Work

Significant work has been done to simplify network management, but to our knowledge, this paper is the first to focus on increasing the manageability of network configurations. Previous approaches include high-level configuration languages [5][6] and new management architectures like the 4D architecture [7] and CONMan [8]. While these tools are effective for error detection, they require customization and do not proactively reduce complexity and redundancies. Our tool, NetPiler, is more proactive and compatible with these approaches, enhancing manageability and reducing operator mistakes.

## 3. NetPiler

### 3.1. Overview

NetPiler simplifies network configurations by finding unique clusters of elements that share certain properties or implement common functions. This approach is independent of the description language and focuses on increasing manageability and readability for human operators. We perform the following steps:

1. **Element Selection:** Identify the element in the configuration to be transformed, such as routes grouped by routing policies.
2. **Parsing and Graph Model Construction:** Parse the configuration and construct a bipartite graph model with sets of instances (I) and their properties (P).
3. **Group Identification:** Identify distinct groups of instances that share common properties.
4. **Configuration Generation:** Generate a new configuration using the identified groups.

### 3.1.1. Inter-domain Routing and BGP Communities

BGP is the de facto standard for inter-domain routing, allowing selective route advertisement to implement business relationships and traffic engineering. Route filters, which have a structure similar to "if-then-else" chains, are used to select routes based on attributes like AS-path and destination prefix. BGP communities, one of the most widely used attributes, group routes with common properties and apply the same action to the community.

A BGP community is encoded as a 32-bit field. If the 32-bit string matches a route filter's condition, the required action is performed. For example, a policy (prefixes received from AS 1, re-advertise, outbound session to AS5) can be implemented by adding a community A to routes from AS 1 and re-announcing them to AS5. Figure 1(a) illustrates an example implementation, showing routers, BGP sessions, and route filters.

## 4. Evaluation

We applied NetPiler to four production networks, including two national providers and two regional providers. The results showed a reduction of up to 70% in BGP community commands, demonstrating the effectiveness of NetPiler in improving manageability. We also discussed different types of reductions and their impact on configuration manageability.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work

NetPiler effectively simplifies network configurations by grouping policies, reducing redundancies, and improving manageability. Future work will focus on further refining the algorithm and extending its application to other aspects of network configuration.
