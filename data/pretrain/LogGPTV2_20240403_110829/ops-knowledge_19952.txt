User: Can you recommend on a python tool / module that allows scheduling tasks on remote machine in a network? 
Note that the solution must be able to not only run certain jobs/commands on remote machines, but also verify that jobs etc are still running (for example, consider the case where a machine dies after a task has been assigned to it?)
Assistant: Fabric (http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.0.1/index.html) is a pretty good toolkit for various sys admin and deployment tasks. It comes with a few pre defined tasks but also gives you the flexibility to add what you need.
I highly recommend it.
