User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is related to the wake up of the system. It starts with quicklookd and iconservicesagent failing to compose an image, followed by the kernel receiving a message type 0xE0000340 and TBT W (2): 0x0040 [x]. Then, AddressBookSourceSync, imagent, and kernel log messages appear, followed by corecaptured receiving a capture event, copying a file, and capturing a log. Finally, the kernel logs the wake up of the system, with a wake reason of Wake on Scan offload, and AppleCamIn handling the wake event.
