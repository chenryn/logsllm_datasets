### What happened? / Describe the bug
When running tests by the command `playwright test --reporter=junit
--shard=1/2 `, in the junit report the skipped tests are marked "passed" with
time '0'.
At the same time, in gitlab ci in Test, after testing in two different
threads, the number of tests in the gitlab is more than it actually is.

I suggest not to include tests with time '0' in the JUnit report or don't
include not running tests
