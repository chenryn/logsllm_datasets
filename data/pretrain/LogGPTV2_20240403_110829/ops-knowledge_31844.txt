User: Lets say I have directory with subdirectories where are projects stored.
How to lock Python script inside that subdirectory ? That it can not scan parent directories, read files, import etc. Is it possible with mod_wsgi ?
And how to disable any python functions ?
Thank
Assistant: There are two options. Use mod_wsgi daemon mode and run the daemon process as a distinct user. Then lock down all your file permissions appropriately to deny access from that user. The second is that mod_wsgi daemon mode also supports a chroot option. Using a chroot is obviously a lot more complicated to set up however.
