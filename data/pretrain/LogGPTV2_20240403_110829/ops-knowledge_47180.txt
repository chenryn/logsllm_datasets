**Issue with Multiprocessing Demo**

I have a multiprocessing demo where I am encountering some issues. Despite researching for a night, I have been unable to resolve the problem. Could someone help me?

**Objective:**
- The parent process should act as a producer.
- When tasks are available, the parent process should fork child processes to consume these tasks.
- The parent process should monitor the child processes and restart any that exit due to an exception.

**Code:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
import sys, signal, os, random, time, traceback

child_process = []
child_process_num = 4
queue = Queue(0)

def work(queue):
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal.SIG_DFL)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal.SIG_DFL)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, signal.SIG_DFL)
    
    # Simulate work by sleeping
    time.sleep(10)

def kill_child_processes(signum, frame):
    # Terminate all children
    pass

def restart_child_process(signum, frame):
    global child_process

    for i in range(len(child_process)):
        child = child_process[i]

        try:
            if child.is_alive():
                continue
        except OSError as e:
            pass

        child.join()  # Ensure no zombie processes
        new_child = Process(target=work, args=(queue,))
        new_child.start()
        child_process[i] = new_child  # Restart the process

        child = None
        return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    reload(sys)
    sys.setdefaultencoding("utf-8")

    for i in range(child_process_num):
        child = Process(target=work, args=(queue,))
        child.start()
        child_process.append(child)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, kill_child_processes)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, kill_child_processes)  # Hook SIGTERM
    signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, restart_child_process)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE, signal.SIG_DFL)
```

**Error Output:**

When this program runs, the following errors occur:

```
Error in atexit._run_exitfuncs:

    pid, sts = os.waitpid(self.pid, flag)
OSError: [Errno 10] No child processes
```

If I send a signal to one of the child processes using `kill -SIGINT {child_pid}`, I get the following error:

```

    pid, sts = os.waitpid(self.pid, flag)
OSError: [Errno 4] Interrupted system call
```

**Analysis:**

The main process is waiting for all child processes to terminate before exiting itself, which involves a blocking call (e.g., `wait4`). The signal sent to the child process interrupts this blocking call, leading to the stack trace.

I am not entirely clear on whether the signal sent to the child process is being redirected to the parent process, which then interrupts the `wait4` call. This behavior is related to Unix process group behaviors.
