image  that  is  highly  indicative  or  relevant  for  our  purposes.  
Therefore,  we  built  our  work  largely  upon  our  intuition  and  the 
image  study  reported  in  [16],  which  was  built  on  existing 
psychological research but focused on the PassPoints scheme only.  
The image choice study in [16] assumed that the level of detail of 
an image is just as important as how many hot spots are present. A 
user  selects  a  point  by  going  through  the  following  procedure: 
firstly they must select an area they wish to work in, and then they 
must pick a point in this chosen area to use. If the image is of high 
detail,  a  spot  can  easily  be  selected;  if  a  low-detail  image,  it  is 
much more difficult to pick a memorable point. 
Figure  2  shows  a  map  along  with  a  cross  section.  If  one  had  to 
select a point in the style of PassPoints, it would not be difficult as 
there  are  an  abundance  of  hotspots  that  could  be  completely 
captured by a pen-point.

Figure 3 is different in that, upon selecting an area of interest, the 
level of detail is low, making it difficult to select a pen-point sized 
area. Any focal points that were apparent in the main image (on 
the  left)  disappear  when  applying  the  point  of  the  pen  to  the 
chosen area (the right image), due to the overall lack of detail.

The role of the background images in our variant of DAS and the 
role  of  images  used  in  PassPoints  may  have  a  similar  level  of 
importance with respect to the security of the scheme. Thus it was 
decided to select images in much the same way, the main criteria 
being  those  that  have  meaningful  content  and  are  rich  [16].  The 
images we planned to use were of an everyday theme that could be 
related to easily by everyone.

The issue of background images inducing bias is important from a 
security  perspective.  Such  problems  exist  in  the  original  DAS 
scheme,  where users  are  inclined  to  incorporate  symmetry about 
an axis (e.g. the center) in their drawings. When beginning to draw 
a symmetric image, the user must pick an ‘anchor’ point or region 
around which to develop their secret. As users of DAS are already 
inclined to create secrets influenced by the drawing grid alone, it 
is important to select images that do not introduce a possibility of 
imposing  further  bias  based  on  their  content.  Figure  4(a)  is  an 
example of such an image that would almost certainly encourage 
the creation of predictably placed secrets, as the only focal point is 
the famous  Stonehenge  site.  Figure  4(b)  however  contains  many 
more focal points that could distribute the user’s attention widely.  
With these examples in mind, we decided that the most desirable 
images should contain many areas of interest and be bursting with 
content.  Each  person  who  views  such  an  image  may  take  an 
interest in a different part. This would increase the variation of the 
secrets created by users, and make it more difficult to predict how 
a particular background image would influence a user. (Any trends 
discovered  with  respect  to  a  particular  background  image  would 
enable an attacker to piece together a graphical dictionary of likely 
responses.)  
It  is  worthwhile  to  note  the  following  differences  between  the 
DAS  and  PassPoints  schemes.  First,  there  are  fundamental 
differences  in  creating  a  free-from  drawing  as  a  password  and 
clicking a number of locations on an image as a password.  
Second, a user can make use of the background aids in the DAS 
scheme  in  any  of  the  following  three  ways:  1)  The  user  has  a 
secret  in  mind  to  begin  with  and  draws  using  points  from  the 
background to map various features of their drawing, 2) The user’s 
choice of secret is affected by various characteristics of the image, 
and their secret shares traits exhibited by the image, and 3) A mix 
of the two. However, we believe that it is unlikely for a user of the 
PassPoints scheme to make use of the image aid in the first way. 
We decided that we would also include an image of low detail in 
our experiment to gauge the effect of such a background choice. 
As well as the content of background images, the format was also 
an important consideration. The displays of most PDAs are of low 
resolution,  thus  ideal  images  would  have  to  mirror  this  setup. 
Distorted  images  are  of  course  detrimental  to  the  experiment  as 
they are more difficult to focus on. 
Another concern in our experiment design was how many images 
would be presented to the user to select from. Since people taking 
part in our experiment would be doing so on a voluntary basis, an 
excessive  amount  of  images  to  look  through  would  reduce  their 
enthusiasm.  The  chosen  approach  was  to  gather  images  from  a 
limited number of categories. 
5. USER STUDY 1: A PILOT STUDY 
5.1 Experiment Stationery 
We developed paper stationery to capture input to our experiment 
and organise it so that information could be extracted as efficiently 
as  possible.  The  main  stationery  contained  two  sets  of  drawing 
grids, one to ‘set’ the secret and another to login after a distraction 
period.  This  setup  was  printed  onto  both  ordinary  A4  paper  and 
transparencies.  The  paper  grid  was  given  to  participants  who 
would  use  the  original  DAS  scheme  whilst  the  transparencies 
would  be  given  to  those  testing  our  variant  with  background 
images.  The  size  of  the  drawing  grid  was  set  at  3.7”  (corner  to 
corner) replicating the screen size of a top-selling PDA at the time. 
In addition, previous research [12] suggests that a 5×5 grid would 
provide a happy medium between usability and security. Therefore, 
we took this dimension as default in this study.  
Aside from the stationery given to the user, a sheet was developed 
so that the experiment facilitator could make notes in a structured 
way  whilst  observing  each  participant.  This  too  included  two 
drawing grids so that they could trace the route of the image being 
created  in  front  of  them.  It  also  included  sections  to  record  any 
interesting  traits  exhibited  by  the  participant  as  well  as  the 
characteristics of the secret, e.g. length and stroke count.   
An  A4  template  known  as  the  “Practice  grid”  was  also  created, 
consisting purely of drawing grids, 6 in total. This was to give the 
participant ample opportunity to practice the drawing of a secret 
that abided by the rules of DAS. In order for participants using the 
BDAS  scheme  to  practice,  scribbling  was  allowed  with  a  non-
permanent marker upon the transparencies. 
The background images themselves were printed on a sheet of A4 
high  quality  paper,  in  a  layout  that  mirrored  the  location  of  the 
grids printed on the transparency. This enabled the grid to easily 
overlay the desired image. 
For  those  using  a  transparency,  colored  marker  pens  were 
available.  This  was  to  cover  the  possibility  that  the  color  of  a 
background image clashed with the standard black marker.  
5.2 Procedure 
A total of 21 subjects were recruited, 15 male and 6 female. None 
of them had previously used DAS passwords. The subjects were 
then  asked  for  their  consent.  The  majority  of  the  subjects  (15) 
were in the age range of 18-30, while 5 subjects were in the age 
range of 31-50, and 1 in the age range of 50+.  
Participant  backgrounds  and  occupations  were  also  collected  to 
see  if  the  DAS  scheme  was  as  accessible  to  people  from  a 
technical  background  as  those  from  a  non-technical  background. 
14 subjects were of non-technical backgrounds and the remaining 
7  subjects  technical.  People  in  the  technical  category  included 
students  of  science  and  engineering  disciplines.  Occupations 
found 
teachers, 
merchandisers and  solicitors.  These  are  types  of  jobs  that  would 
not  normally  be  associated  with  technical  expertise.  It  was 
important  to  get  a  good  selection  of  people  with  these  non-
the  non-technical 
category 
include 
in 
technical  backgrounds  as  any  new  password  scheme  must  be 
accessible to all, like the textual password scheme. It is the results 
from the non-technical people that will really show how usable a 
new password scheme is.  
The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following two 
experimental groups.  
Control  group  (or  the  DAS  group).  People  in  this  group  were 
given the stationery that represented the original DAS scheme. 
Background  image  group  (or  the  BDAS  group).  People  in  this 
group were given the special stationery printed on transparencies 
to  simplify  the  addition  of  a  background  image.  Each  subject  in 
this  group  was  presented  with  five  images,  and  instructed  to 
choose one as the background image. We allowed users to choose 
their own backgrounds, because we would like to gauge what kind 
of  images  would  be  popular.  Any  answer  to  this  will  certainly 
have implications to the security of BDAS passwords.  
It  was  the  intention  to  examine  the  characteristics  of  DAS 
passwords  when  the  user  is  aided  by  a  background  image  as 
opposed  to  the  standard  drawing  grid.  Our  hypothesis  was  that 
users  will  set  more  complicated  passwords  with  the  help  of 
background images  to  map  the construction  of  their  secret.  Also 
we wanted to see whether this aid enables a user to remember their 
password over an extended period of time. 
In  advance  of  the  experiment,  each  subject  was  given  an 
information sheet. This provided information of their activities on 
the  day  of  the  experiment  and  most  importantly  explained  the 
intricacies of a DAS password  and the rules of creating one.  A 
small number of example drawings were also included. 
On  the  day,  participants  were  given  time  to  practice  with  their 
assigned scheme.  Upon indication they had practiced enough, we 
began the experiment and asked them to create a secret on the grid 
in a slow and steady fashion. After a short delay we asked them to 
repeat what they had initially drawn. While all this was happening, 
a  facilitator  documented  the  route  of  their  secret  on  the  results 
sheet  so  that  it could  be  compared  to  the  route  of their  repeated 
secret. Then one week after the initial results were collected, the 
subjects were asked to try and re-create what they had drawn on 
the first occasion. 
5.3 Background Images Used 
The  images  used  in  our  experiment  are  shown  in  Figure  5.  The 
images were taken from various categories: space, nature, crowd, 
map and an image of low detail. 
The stars image would test the temptation of users drawing lines 
that simply ‘join the dots’, the dots obviously being the stars. Due 
to the fact the stars are evenly distributed on the image, it would 
also  be  interesting  to  see  to  what  extent  this  increases  the 
distribution of the secret about the grid. 
The  crowd  image  came  to  mind  almost  immediately  when 
thinking  in  terms  of  images  that  completely  populate  the  space 
given to them. Many examples can be found of crowds at concerts 
and  soccer  matches  where  the  content  spills  out  beyond  the 
frontiers of the image. This was considered to be beneficial for our 
purposes as there is no empty space. 
The map category shares characteristics with both the crowd and 
space  categories:  snapshots  of  crowds  usually  constitute  a  snap 
shot of a bigger picture, and with space pictures there could be a 
tendency  for  the  “join  the  dots”  effect  to  occur  with  points  of 
interest on the map.  
Figure 5. Background images used in the experiment (all 
reduced in size for this paper) (Map image reproduced with 
permission from Collins Bartholomew) 
The  image  of  the  plant  was  chosen  as,  despite  the  number  of 
hotspots in the image (leaves, blades of grass), the hotspots are of 
low  detail.  It  is  hoped  that  if  selected,  we  will  see  how  a  user 
would  react  to  this  sudden  lack  of  detail,  when  at  first  glance  it 
appears to be rich with content. 
For  the  low  detail  image  a  playing  card  was  chosen,  the  9  of 
spades. This doesn’t share any traits with the previous categories 
as  it  is  of  low  detail.  It  is  hoped  to  gauge  if  this  type  of  image 
would be popular and would have an adverse effect on the secret 
set. 
5.4 RESULTS  
5.4.1 Background Image Choices 
The  distribution  of  background  image  choices  made  by  BDAS 
participants is shown in Figure 6.  
The playing card was the most popular choice, and it was selected 
50% of the time. The nearest to the playing card in popularity was 
the flower image, having 30% of selections. The rest of the images 
were very ‘busy’ and were not as popular. It was anticipated that 
images dense with content (such as the crowd scene and the map) 
would  be  the  most  popular,  due  to  the  many  points  of  interest 
within. This was clearly contradicted.

5.4.2 Secret Quality 
We collected 10 valid secrets in each of the experiment groups.  
Complexity. We compare secret complexity in the two groups in 
Table  1.  The  average  password  length  with  background  images 
was 26.6 and without, 17.5. A t-test yields a result of t=2.377, p 
< .05 (one tail), indicating that the password length for the BDAS 
group was significantly longer than for those in the DAS group. 
The  background  images  did  also  increase  the  stroke  count  of 
passwords on average, but not to a statistically significant level.

As  such,  we  consider  that  our  hypothesis  that  the  background 
images  did  encourage  people  to  choose  secrets  with  more 
complexity was supported.  
Symmetry. When examining all secrets, we found that 9 out of 10 
(90%) secrets created in the DAS group had global symmetry, i.e. 
all the strokes of a drawing were symmetric about the same axis 
[12]. This figure is much higher than the percentage observed by 
Nali  and  Thorpe  (30%)  [8].  However,  only  5  out  of  10  (50%) 
secrets in the BDAS group possessed global symmetry.  
According  to  [13,  12],  global  symmetry  leads  to  weak  DAS 
passwords that are vulnerable to dictionary attacks, and should be 
avoided. Therefore, the above observation appears to suggest that 
background  images  automatically  aided  the  users  in  avoiding 
global  symmetry,  further  improving  the  quality  (i.e.  security)  of 
the resulting secrets. 
Centering.  In  addition,  9  out  of  10  (90%)  secrets  in  the  DAS 
group were centred or approximately centred within the drawing 
grid. This figure is close to the percentage observed in [8] (86%). 
However, only 7 out of 10 (70%) secrets in the BDAS group were 
centred or approximately centred within the grid. This appears to 
suggest  that  background  images  can  also  reduce  to  some  extent 
another predictable characteristic in DAS passwords, making the 
resulting passwords even more secure.

5.4.3 Recall – Five Minutes After 
A recall test was conducted five minutes after a secret was created. 
This can be regarded as a simulation of the common practice of 
password  confirmation.  Often,  when  a  newly  chosen  (textual) 
password is set, it has to be repeated correctly for confirmation. In
