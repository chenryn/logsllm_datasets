User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Cannot SSH: debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REPLY We have a server XXX ON Amazon EC2.

SSH is running on a standard (22) port.

I placed my pubkey at the /.ssh/authorized_keys file

The fun thing is that YESTERDAY it was working great! 

But today, I don't know what happened! I just can't log in.


  ssh -vvvv servername


is stuck on


  debug1: expecting
  SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REPLY


I checked my pubkey and it's there! (how I checked?? I asked the other guy to check)

and then I used another computer (windows 7 + putty) and placed my new pubkey.
ANd what? I was able to log in! And that's another computer with Win7 is ont the same LAN which menas that the external IP is the same.

My private key works for other servers but not with this.

Please help!

Assistant: Change the network interface MTU to solve it. This is a bug for ubuntu 14.04.

This worked for me:

sudo ip li set mtu 1200 dev wlan0


OR

sudo ifconfig wlan0 mtu 1200


ssh fails to connect to VPN host - hangs at 'expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY'
