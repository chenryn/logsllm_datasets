**Note:** There is a typo in the comment inside the bug report template located at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`: `cat /etc/oss-release` (double 's').

**Apache Airflow Provider Versions:**
- Not applicable

**Deployment Method:**
Docker-compose 1.25.0

**Issue Description:**
The issue is related to the Apache Airflow UI, which displays duplicated notifications when all tags are removed from the input after filtering DAGs.

**Expected Behavior:**
Notifications should not be duplicated.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. In the main view, above the list of DAGs (just below the top bar menu), there is a section where notifications appear.
2. Ensure that there are at least two notifications present (the type of notification does not matter).
3. Use the "Filter DAGs by tag" input and apply a valid tag for filtering.
4. After the filtering is complete, clear the input either by clicking on the 'x' next to the tag or the 'x' near the right side of the input.
5. Observe that the notifications are now duplicated, resulting in four notifications instead of the original two (each notification is displayed twice).

**Additional Information:**
- The input field ID is `s2id_autogen1`.
- This bug only occurs if all tags are removed from the filtering input. If you remove a tag while another one is still present, the bug will not occur.
- The issue is not present when searching for DAGs by name using the "Search DAGs" input.
