**What happened** :  
The issue is related to Airflow UI and it shows duplicated notifications when
removing all the tags from the input after filtering DAGs.
**What you expected to happen** :  
The notifications should not be duplicated.
**How to reproduce it** :  
In the main view, above the list of the DAGs (just below the top bar menu),
there is a place where notifications appear. Suppose that there are 2
notifications (no matter which). Now try to search DAGs by tag using 'Filter
DAGs by tag' input and use a valid tag. After the filtering is done, clear the
input either by clicking on 'x' next to the tag or on the 'x' near the right
side of the input. Notice that the notifications are duplicated and now you
have 4 instead of 2 (each one is displayed twice). The input id is
`s2id_autogen1`.  
This bug happens only if all the tags are removed from the filtering input. If
you remove the tag while there is still another one in the input, the bug will
not appear. Also, it is not present while searching DAGs by name using the
input 'Search DAGs'.
After search, before removing tags from input:
