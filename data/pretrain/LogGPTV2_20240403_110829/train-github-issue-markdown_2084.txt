When a LeftNav is closed, it is not hidden but simply `translateX` to
somewhere out of the screen. However, the focus state of the button in the
LeftNav is still active, this will cause some confused behavior for end users.
A simple test case is as following
    class TestExample extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = { open: false };
        }
        closeNav() {
            this.setState({ open: false });
            console.log('click triggered');
        }
        render() {
            return (
                     this.setState({ open: true })}/>
                         this.closeNav}/>
            );
        }
    }
Suppose the users click the "New form" button, which opens the LeftNav, and
they click "Submit form" after some operation, if exists. The leftNav will be
hidden obviously, however, after it is closed, if the user unexpectedly press
key `ENTER` or `SPACE`, they will find the form is submitted again as the
button is still focused. (in our case there will be duplicated "click
triggered" in the console log)
This behavior is expected with the specs but not the users.
Currently the workaround is to manipulate the `disableKeyboardFocus` property
of EnhancedButton when the form is closed after #3000 is merged.
