User: I trying to setup virtualenvwrapper in GitBash (Windows 7), but get an error message.
When I run this command: " $ source /c/Python27/Scripts/virtualenvwrapper.sh"
Then I get an error: sh.exe":mktemp:command not found ERROR: virtualenvwrapper could not create a temporary file name.
Somebody help me...
Assistant: i had found a solution ,just hope to help someone like me.
download the mktemp.exe , put it into the C:\msys\1.0\bin ,then everything will be ok...
