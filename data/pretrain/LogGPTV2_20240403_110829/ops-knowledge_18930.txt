**User:** I am trying to set up `virtualenvwrapper` in Git Bash (Windows 7), but I encounter an error message. When I run the command: `$ source /c/Python27/Scripts/virtualenvwrapper.sh`, I get the following error: `sh.exe": mktemp: command not found ERROR: virtualenvwrapper could not create a temporary file name.` Can someone help me, please?

**Assistant:** I have found a solution and hope it can assist others facing the same issue. To resolve this, you need to download `mktemp.exe` and place it into the `C:\msys\1.0\bin` directory. This should fix the problem and allow `virtualenvwrapper` to function correctly.
