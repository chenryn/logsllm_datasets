I currently have Python 2.7 installed on my Mac OS 10.7. I attempted to install the `py27-mysql` package, which includes the MySQLdb interface for Python. When I ran `sudo port install py27-mysql`, MacPorts began to install all the dependencies for that package, such as Python 2.7 and MySQL 5, even though these were already installed on my system.

Now, I have a few questions:

1. Why did this happen?
2. Where are the native Mac OS versions of Python and MySQL located now?
3. Which version will be used if I work from the command line after the installation?
4. Is Homebrew a better alternative?

**Answers:**

1. **Why did this happen?**
   - MacPorts installs its own versions of packages in `/opt/local/` and `/opt/local/bin`. This ensures that the installed packages are isolated from the system's default installations, which helps avoid conflicts and provides a consistent environment.

2. **Where are the native Mac OS versions of Python and MySQL located now?**
   - The native Mac OS versions of Python and MySQL remain in their original locations:
     - Default Python: `/usr/bin/python`
     - Default MySQL: `/usr/local/mysql` (or another location depending on how you installed it)

3. **Which version will be used if I work from the command line after the installation?**
   - The version that is used depends on the order of directories in your `PATH` environment variable. If `/opt/local/bin` is listed before `/usr/bin` in your `PATH`, the MacPorts versions will be used. You can check your `PATH` by running `echo $PATH` in the terminal.
   - To use the MacPorts versions, you can add `/opt/local/bin` to the beginning of your `PATH` in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
     ```sh
     export PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH
     ```

4. **Is Homebrew a better alternative?**
   - Both MacPorts and Homebrew are package managers for macOS, and each has its strengths. Homebrew is generally considered easier to use and more popular, with a larger community and more up-to-date packages. However, MacPorts is known for its robustness and stability, especially in handling complex dependencies.
   - If you prefer simplicity and a larger community, Homebrew might be a better choice. If you need more control over the installation process and don't mind a steeper learning curve, MacPorts is a solid option.
