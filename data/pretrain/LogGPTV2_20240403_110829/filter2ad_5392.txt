valve  made  of  closely  knitted  teflon  stiffened  with
polyurethane.  The  prosthesis  is  fashioned  in  the
operating-theatre from a standard crimped woven teflon
tube; it is sutured to the base of the aortic cusps and to
the aortic wall once the diseased valve has been excised.
The advantage of this type of prosthesis is that it can be
adapted to the type of cusp deformity found, the artificial
cusps replacing the shrivelled cusps of valves which have
been freely  regurgitant.  7 patients  with stenosis  and
regurgitation  have  undergone  this  operation,  and  in
each the absence of an aortic  diastolic  murmur post-
operatively  indicated  relief  of incompetence  by  the
prosthesis.  3 patients died in the first twenty-four hours
from causes other than failure of the valve.  KAY et al.12
use two types of artificial valve for the relief of aortic-
valvular  disease.  In  patients  with  regurgitation  in
whom part of the valvular tissue is  preserved, plastic
prostheses consisting of three leaflets  of the same size
and shape are fashioned in the theatre to the individual
requirements and then sutured in position.  When the
patient’s valve has to be completely excised (as often in
severe  calcific  stenosis),  the  three  leaflets  have  to  be
deeper and are then buttressed with teflon felt.  This
procedure  has  been  used  in  28  patients  with  aortic
regurgitation and in 8 with calcific stenosis; 4 in the first
group died, and 3 in the second. Careful follow-up has
shown  effective  function  of  the  prosthetic  valves.
HARKEN et a1.13 have employed a caged ball-valve in the
treatment of 6 patients with aortic-valve disease.  4 died,
but in the other 2 the valve was functioning satisfactorily
several months after the operation.
Although these reports  are promising, much clearly
remains  to  be done before  valve  replacement  can  be
considered a safe or routine procedure.  Until a wholly
satisfactory prosthesis  can be produced, physician and
surgeon will rightly be chary of submitting a patient to
such an operation-unless his clinical condition makes
prompt surgical  relief imperative.  Moreover,  cardio-
pulmonary bypass itself carries great hazards in patients
with long-standing cardiac failure,  myocardial disease,
impaired  hepatic  or  renal  function,  or  serious
pulmonary-vascular  disease.  In  patients  with  aortic
stenosis  the  state  of the  myocardium  is  of especial
importance; years of hypoxia may have induced ischaemic
fibrosis, leaving the muscle too poor to cope with the
demands of a long perfusion.  Selective hypothermia and
coronary perfusion 14 can be of great assistance but may
not suffice to preserve the patient’s life.  The introduction
of a satisfactory valve prosthesis would justify operation
in healthier patients, but how to ensure the survival of
foreign material subjected to constant movement has yet
to be discovered.  HARKEN et a1.13  have laid down ten
criteria  which a satisfactory plastic valve must satisfy:
It must not lead to thrombosis and embolism; it  must
be chemically inert and not damaging to blood elements;
it  must offer  no resistance  to  blood-flow under physio-
logical conditions; it must close promptly; it must remain

closed during the appropriate phase of the cardiac cycle;
it  must be durable, and able to retain its  physical and
geometrical properties; it  must be inserted in a physio-
logical site, generally the normal site; it must be capable
of permanent fixation;  it  must not annoy the patient;
and its insertion must be technically practicable.
Little  is  known of the  long-term  survival  of plastic
valves, and at present the immediate hazards of infection,
acceptance of the prosthesis, thrombosis, embolism, and
blood destruction cannot always be avoided.
As far as the incompetent mitral valve is concerned,
open repair without valve replacement, as practised by
WooLER in this country, seems to be the best procedure
where the cusps are still mobile; but many patients need
a complete valve prosthesis and the  Starr type is  the
most promising.  The physician should entertain sober
optimism; but the patient should realise that certain and
longstanding  cure by  valve  replacement  is  a  future
prospect rather than an immediate reality.
A Confusion of Errors
UNDER the alluring  title  of single-enzyme defects  a
profusion  of  new  diseases  is  about  to  transform
GARROD’S classically simple concept of inborn metabolic
errors into the woolliest of fashionable medical notions.
That a single abnormal protein can cause a characteristic
clinical syndrome is  not in doubt.  That a few diseases
result  from the congenital inability  of certain cells  to
perform a single but apparently crucial enzyme reaction
is unproven but is strongly suggested by circumstantial
evidence.  But  to  suppose  that  every  single-enzyme
defect demonstrated in vitro is necessarily the cause of
the illness with which it is associated-or of any illness-
is  an over-simplification.  Isolated enzyme reactions do
not occur in living tissue: their existence would defeat
the raison d’etre of enzymes.  Perpetually on the brink
of  a  chemical  explosion,  cells  rely  on  these  highly
specific catalysts to transform bursts of free energy into
stepwise successions  of minute discharges,  and at the
same time to convert a haphazard supply of food energy
into  intracellular  fuel  stores.  Moreover,  uptake  and
expenditure are probably kept in balance by a hierarchy
of  broad-spectrum  metabolic  regulators-hormones,
coenzymes, vitamins-capable of coupling and uncoup-
ling pairs, sequences, or whole cycles of multi-enzyme
reactions.  Faults  in  this  coordinating  superstructure
rather  than  in  individual  reactions  almost  certainly
account  for  most  metabolic  disorders  seen  by  the
clinician  and for  most so-called single-enzyme defects
diagnosed in the laboratory.
The  family  of  metabolic  errors  associated  with
excessive deposition of glycogen in one or several organs
or  tissues  has  long  been  known to  include  various
clinical syndromes, but only in the past ten years has
it  been  recognised  that  the  biochemical abnormality
itself can arise  in  many different ways.1  Blood, liver,
and muscle tissue from these patients is often strikingly
deficient in enzyme-like activity.  By isolating in vitro
a  select  group  of reactions  known to  be involved in
1.  Lancet, 1961, i, 206.
glycogen  synthesis  or  breakdown,  CoRi  and  other
workers were able to pinpoint at least six different and
characteristic  defects.2-5  They  did  not  suggest  that
these defects necessarily represented underlying causes,
nor that they excluded other biochemical abnormalities.
Indeed, since the in-vitro study of isolated tissue-enzyme
reactions  depends  on  artificial  conditions  in  which
interference or lack of interference from other enzymes
is  much reduced, such a claim is hardly ever justified.
But biochemical pigeonholes being hard to resist,  for
some years each enzyme defect was equated with a more
or  less  well  defined  clinical  type.  Reviewing  8  new
cases studied in some detail  LowE et al .6 remark that
"we are  now faced  with a  situation  in which patients
with similar hepatic defects have different aberrations in
carbohydrate metabolism ... in which patients with no
demonstrable in-vitro defect of enzymes involved in the
early stages of glycogenosis may act clinically as ’classic’
cases  of glucose-6-phosphatase  deficiency  ... and in
which  siblings  do  not  always  have  the  same  hepatic
enzyme defect".
This last paradox (which is  not confined to the liver)
is  the  most puzzling,  for  it  seems  to  contradict  the
one-gene one-enzyme hypothesis of hereditary disease.
The evidence  for  the  paradox  is  derived  from  two
families-the first  carefully investigated two years ago
by  CALDERBANK  et  al. in this  country,  the  second
recently  reported by EBERLEIN  et  al.8 in the  United
States.
The older child in the American family was diagnosed
as  a case of type-1 glycogen-storage disease at the age
of six  months, when a liver-biopsy  specimen showed
glucose-6-phosphatase activity reduced to 5% of normal.
Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyses the last step in what is
probably  the  most important  (though  not  the  only)
pathway of glycogen breakdown to glucose; and, while
HERS 9 has probably rightly maintained that only total
in-vitro deficiency should be accepted as absolute proof,
a diagnosis  based  on a  combination  of fasting  hypo-
glycxmia,  hepatomegaly,  raised  blood-glycogen,  and
95% enzyme failure  makes clinical  sense.  A younger
sister  was investigated  two years  later;  and her  con-
dition  proved to  be clinically,  but not biochemically,
closely  similar.  Her  hepatic  glucose-6-phosphatase
activity  was only  " moderately " depressed; but when
her liver glycogen was exposed to the catalytic action of
purified  phosphorylase,  only  about  a  fifth  of  the
expected  number  of glucose  residues  was  recovered.
This pointed to a deficiency of amylo-1, 6-glucosidase,
the  " debrancher "  enzyme  concerned  in  the  patho-
genesis of Cori’s type-3 glycogenosis.1  The defect was
confirmed by assaying specifically  for  this  enzyme in
muscle  and by finding the red cells  of both children
loaded with incompletely degraded glycogen or 
" limit
dextrin ".

Whatever is the significance of similar enzyme defects
in different tissues, both the British and the American
family confirm doubts about the istinct genetic status
of some of the enzymatic types of glycogenosis.  Alterna-
tive explanations-perhaps a common endocrine basis-
come to  mind.  Secondary  biochemical  features-the
rise  in  blood-lipids,  the tendency to  acidsemia,  inter-
ference  with  protein  synthesis-suggest  a  distant
kinship with diabetes; and the influence of hormones on
the course of the disease may be significant.  The place
of glucagon in  diagnosis  and treatment has  caused a
good deal of debate,6 10-12 but little doubt remains that,
in  patients  with  liver  involvement,  response  to  this
hormone is  abnormal and that in favourable cases the
natural and the induced abnormality partly cancel each
other.  A course of ’ Halotestin ’, a synthetic androgen,
brought  about  remarkable  clinical  and  biochemical
improvement  in  one  of  the  children  described  by
EBERLEIN  et  al.8 8  Other  still-unidentified hormones
could also be involved.  Our uncertainty underlines our
almost total ignorance of the links between hormones,
coenzymes, and enzymes.  NAPOLEON observed that no
one man can personally command more than ten other
men.  If Nature organises cell metabolism on the same
principle,  her chain of command remains  one of her
best-guarded secrets.

MEDICAL CENTRE AT KINGSTON
MUCH is heard of division in the medical profession, of
lack of understanding and even of respect between doctors
in hospital and general practice, and of the responsibility
of the National Health Service for these ills.  But hitherto,
although many people have bewailed the circumstances,
few have tried  to improve them.  The action taken by
Kingston Group Hospital Management Committee is the
more remarkable-and the more praiseworthy.
The committee has inspired the building, at Kingston-
upon-Thames, of a medical centre where hospital doctors,
general  practitioners,  medical  officers  of  health,  and
dentists can meet both socially and professionally.  The
centre is housed in a new building which has been supplied
and furnished by a grant of E42,000 from King Edward’s
Hospital Fund.  It is  to be opened in December.  Full
membership will be offered to all registered practitioners
in  the  area,  to  senior  medical  and  dental  staff  of the
hospitals in the Kingston group, and to registered dental
practitioners employed in those hospitals.  The idea is
that  medical  workers  in  all  branches  of  the  Health
Service  shall  meet,  say,  over  lunch,  and  follow  their
meeting with clinical discussion.  The centre will have a
fully-equipped lecture room and library, besides restaurant
and bar.  Thus, through knowing each other better, the
doctors  should better understand each other’s  point of
view and cooperate more effectively in their practice.
So  admirable  a  venture  deserves  to  succeed;  but
success  will  depend  on  the  amount  of  support  from
practitioners in the area.  That the centre should flourish
is  important,  so  that  other hospital  management  com-
mittees may be prompted to follow Kingston’s example.
