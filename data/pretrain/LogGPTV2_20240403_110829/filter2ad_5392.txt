### Valve Prosthesis for Aortic Valvular Disease

A valve prosthesis, composed of a closely knitted Teflon material stiffened with polyurethane, is fashioned in the operating theater from a standard crimped woven Teflon tube. This prosthesis is sutured to the base of the aortic cusps and to the aortic wall after the diseased valve has been excised. The advantage of this type of prosthesis is its adaptability to the specific cusp deformity, with artificial cusps replacing the atrophied cusps of valves that have been freely regurgitant.

Seven patients with stenosis and regurgitation have undergone this operation. In each case, the absence of an aortic diastolic murmur post-operatively indicated relief of incompetence by the prosthesis. Three patients died within the first twenty-four hours due to causes unrelated to the valve's failure.

Kay et al.12 use two types of artificial valves for aortic-valvular disease. For patients with regurgitation where some valvular tissue is preserved, plastic prostheses consisting of three leaflets of the same size and shape are fashioned to individual requirements and sutured in place. When the patient’s valve must be completely excised (as in severe calcific stenosis), the three leaflets are deeper and reinforced with Teflon felt. This procedure has been used in 28 patients with aortic regurgitation and 8 with calcific stenosis; 4 in the first group and 3 in the second group died. Follow-up has shown effective function of the prosthetic valves.

Harken et al.13 have employed a caged ball-valve in the treatment of 6 patients with aortic-valve disease. Four patients died, but the other two had satisfactory valve function several months post-operation.

Despite these promising results, much remains to be done before valve replacement can be considered a safe or routine procedure. Until a wholly satisfactory prosthesis is produced, physicians and surgeons will be cautious about performing such operations unless the patient's clinical condition necessitates prompt surgical relief. Cardiopulmonary bypass itself carries significant risks, especially in patients with long-standing cardiac failure, myocardial disease, impaired hepatic or renal function, or serious pulmonary-vascular disease. In aortic stenosis, the state of the myocardium is particularly important, as years of hypoxia may have induced ischemic fibrosis, leaving the muscle too weak to withstand prolonged perfusion. Selective hypothermia and coronary perfusion14 can be helpful but may not always suffice to preserve the patient's life.

The introduction of a satisfactory valve prosthesis would justify surgery in healthier patients, but the challenge of ensuring the survival of foreign material subjected to constant movement remains. Harken et al.13 have outlined ten criteria for a satisfactory plastic valve:

1. It must not lead to thrombosis and embolism.
2. It must be chemically inert and non-damaging to blood elements.
3. It must offer no resistance to blood flow under physiological conditions.
4. It must close promptly.
5. It must remain closed during the appropriate phase of the cardiac cycle.
6. It must be durable and retain its physical and geometrical properties.
7. It must be inserted in a physiological site, generally the normal site.
8. It must be capable of permanent fixation.
9. It must not cause discomfort to the patient.
10. Its insertion must be technically feasible.

Little is known about the long-term survival of plastic valves, and immediate hazards such as infection, acceptance of the prosthesis, thrombosis, embolism, and blood destruction cannot always be avoided.

For incompetent mitral valves, open repair without valve replacement, as practiced by Wooler, seems to be the best procedure when the cusps are still mobile. However, many patients require a complete valve prosthesis, and the Starr type is the most promising. Physicians should maintain a realistic optimism, while patients should understand that certain and long-lasting cure by valve replacement is a future prospect rather than an immediate reality.

### Single-Enzyme Defects and Metabolic Disorders

Under the alluring title of single-enzyme defects, a profusion of new diseases is transforming Garrod's classically simple concept of inborn metabolic errors into a complex and fashionable medical notion. While it is established that a single abnormal protein can cause a characteristic clinical syndrome, and that some diseases result from the congenital inability of cells to perform a single, crucial enzyme reaction, it is an oversimplification to assume that every single-enzyme defect demonstrated in vitro is necessarily the cause of the associated illness.

Isolated enzyme reactions do not occur in living tissue, as their existence would defeat the purpose of enzymes. Cells, perpetually on the brink of a chemical explosion, rely on highly specific catalysts to transform bursts of free energy into stepwise successions of minute discharges and convert a haphazard supply of food energy into intracellular fuel stores. Uptake and expenditure are likely balanced by a hierarchy of broad-spectrum metabolic regulators—hormones, coenzymes, and vitamins—that couple and uncouple pairs, sequences, or whole cycles of multi-enzyme reactions. Faults in this coordinating superstructure, rather than in individual reactions, likely account for most metabolic disorders seen by clinicians and for most so-called single-enzyme defects diagnosed in the laboratory.

The family of metabolic errors associated with excessive glycogen deposition in one or several organs or tissues includes various clinical syndromes. Only in the past ten years has it been recognized that the biochemical abnormality can arise in many different ways.1 Blood, liver, and muscle tissue from these patients often show strikingly low enzyme-like activity. By isolating in vitro a select group of reactions involved in glycogen synthesis or breakdown, Cori and other workers were able to pinpoint at least six different and characteristic defects.2-5 They did not suggest that these defects necessarily represented underlying causes or excluded other biochemical abnormalities. Indeed, since in-vitro studies of isolated tissue-enzyme reactions depend on artificial conditions, such claims are rarely justified.

However, the allure of biochemical categorization led to equating each enzyme defect with a more or less well-defined clinical type. Reviewing eight new cases, Lowe et al.6 noted that "we are now faced with a situation in which patients with similar hepatic defects have different aberrations in carbohydrate metabolism ... in which patients with no demonstrable in-vitro defect of enzymes involved in the early stages of glycogenosis may act clinically as 'classic' cases of glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency ... and in which siblings do not always have the same hepatic enzyme defect."

This last paradox, not confined to the liver, is the most puzzling, as it seems to contradict the one-gene one-enzyme hypothesis of hereditary disease. The evidence for this paradox comes from two families: one investigated by Calderbank et al. in the UK, and the other reported by Eberlein et al.8 in the US.

In the American family, the older child was diagnosed with type-1 glycogen-storage disease at six months, with a liver-biopsy specimen showing glucose-6-phosphatase activity reduced to 5% of normal. Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the last step in the most important pathway of glycogen breakdown to glucose. Hers9 maintained that only total in-vitro deficiency should be accepted as absolute proof, but a diagnosis based on fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, raised blood-glycogen, and 95% enzyme failure makes clinical sense. A younger sister, investigated two years later, had a clinically similar but biochemically distinct condition. Her hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was only moderately depressed, but exposure of her liver glycogen to purified phosphorylase yielded only about a fifth of the expected glucose residues, indicating a deficiency of amylo-1,6-glucosidase, the "debrancher" enzyme in Cori’s type-3 glycogenosis.1 This defect was confirmed by assaying specifically for this enzyme in muscle and finding the red cells of both children loaded with incompletely degraded glycogen or "limit dextrin."

Whatever the significance of similar enzyme defects in different tissues, both the British and American families confirm doubts about the distinct genetic status of some enzymatic types of glycogenosis. Alternative explanations, perhaps a common endocrine basis, come to mind. Secondary biochemical features, such as the rise in blood lipids, the tendency to acidemia, and interference with protein synthesis, suggest a distant kinship with diabetes. Hormonal influence on the course of the disease may be significant. The role of glucagon in diagnosis and treatment has been debated,6,10-12 but there is little doubt that, in patients with liver involvement, response to this hormone is abnormal and, in favorable cases, the natural and induced abnormalities partly cancel each other. A course of Halotestin, a synthetic androgen, brought about remarkable clinical and biochemical improvement in one of the children described by Eberlein et al.8 Other unidentified hormones could also be involved. Our uncertainty underscores our almost total ignorance of the links between hormones, coenzymes, and enzymes. Napoleon observed that no one man can personally command more than ten other men. If Nature organizes cell metabolism on the same principle, her chain of command remains one of her best-guarded secrets.

### Medical Centre at Kingston

Much is heard about division in the medical profession, lack of understanding and respect between hospital doctors and general practitioners, and the responsibility of the National Health Service for these ills. While many have lamented these circumstances, few have attempted to improve them. The action taken by the Kingston Group Hospital Management Committee is both remarkable and praiseworthy.

The committee has inspired the building of a medical center in Kingston-upon-Thames, where hospital doctors, general practitioners, medical officers of health, and dentists can meet both socially and professionally. The center, housed in a new building supplied and furnished by a £42,000 grant from King Edward’s Hospital Fund, is set to open in December. Full membership will be offered to all registered practitioners in the area, senior medical and dental staff of the hospitals in the Kingston group, and registered dental practitioners employed in those hospitals. The idea is that medical workers in all branches of the Health Service will meet, for example, over lunch, and follow up with clinical discussions. The center will feature a fully-equipped lecture room and library, as well as a restaurant and bar. Through better mutual understanding, doctors should cooperate more effectively in their practice.

This admirable venture deserves to succeed, and its success will depend on the support from practitioners in the area. It is important that the center flourishes, prompting other hospital management committees to follow Kingston’s example.
