 Identify the Technologies Used
There are different ways to discover the type of technology used in a target organization. 
For instance, job postings offered on the target organization’s site—and on other 
specialized job websites—are a valuable source of information (you can find the type 
of skills needed, required IT certifications, past experience with specific products/
vendors), and from that you can easily identify the type of IT infrastructure, the OS, and 
other software used.
Tip! if a target organization has more than one branch office, the type of skills 
needed—as listed in job posts—for a specific branch could be an indicator of the 
activities taking place in that branch.
To identify the technologies used to build a target website, there are many online 
services and tools available for this task. The most popular service is Built With 
(https://builtwith.com). To use this service, enter the target domain name to view its 
technology profile and relationship profile. The technology profile will show detailed 
information about target websites such as analytics and tracking codes, widgets, website 
languages, whether it is optimized for mobile views, content delivery network (CDN), 
JavaScript libraries, advertising networks, e-mail services, name server provider, SSL 
certificate, web server type, encoding, and document information. A relationship profile 
view offers important information about the target domain; it shows the historical usage 
of identifiers (such as Google AdSense identifiers) that are shared with other websites. 
By knowing this information, you can uncover which websites are also controlled by the 
same company/individual (see Figure 8-3).

Another tool to identify the web technologies used on target websites is Wappalyzer 
(https://www.wappalyzer.com). You can install it as an add-on to your Firefox or 
Chrome browser to investigate the technologies used on any website you visit.
Identifying the key technologies used—both software and hardware—will help you 
do some focused research to identify any vulnerabilities in the target organization’s 
software, identify product-specific defects, and identify application-specific 
configuration problems. In the coming section, we will demonstrate how to identify a 
target OS server using an online tool.

 Web Scraping Tools
There are automated tools that can help you to collect various types of information 
from the target website easily. Such tools are known as web scraping tools or web data 
extraction tools. Imagine you want to collect e-mails from a big website (with thousands 
of pages). Doing this manually would be a daunting task, but when using automated 
tools, you can do it with a single click.
 theHarvester
theHarvester (https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) is a tool for gathering 
subdomain names, e-mail addresses, virtual hosts, open ports/banners, and employee 
names from different public sources such as Google, Bing, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo, pgp, 
and more. The search conducted using this tool is passive, meaning that the target will 
not notice any reconnaissance activities from your side.
theharvester comes preinstalled on Kali Linux. However, you can install it on any 
Linux-based OS by entering the following command in terminal:
apt-get theharvester
To collect the target organization’s e-mails, open the program and type the following:
theharvester -d springer.com -b all -l 500 -f results.txt
theharvester is used to execute the tool, and these are some options:
• 
-d specifies the domain to search or the company name.
• 
-b specifies a data source such as google, googleCSE, bing, bingapi, 
pgp, linkedin, google-profiles, jigsaw, twitter, googleplus, and all.
• 
-l limits the number of results to work with.
• 
f- saves the results into an HTML or XML file.
In the previous script, we are asking the tool to pull results from all data sources 
and to limit the result to 500 results. Also, the generated results should be saved in a file 
named results.txt in the same working directory (see Figure 8-4).

com using theHarvester. The tool also resolves the target domain name into its IP 
address and discovers many virtual hosts related to the target domain name.

The previous example is the simplest usage of this tool; we were able to collect target 
e-mail addresses in addition to discovering many subdomain names of the target main 
domain. This search also discovers virtual hosts (meaning multiple websites hosted on 
the same server). After getting some target e-mail addresses, you can use the techniques 
in previous chapters to build a profile for each one.
 Web Data Extractor
Web Data Extractor (www.webextractor.com) is a commercial program that collects 
various types of data including URLs, phone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and 
meta tag information and body text.
 Email Extractor
Email Extractor (https://www.email-extractor.io) is a Chrome add-on that extracts 
all e-mails from currently visited web pages.
Investigating the company domain name is the second task after the initial web page 
exploration. Different types of searches can be conducted on domain names. Let’s start 
by finding the WHOIS information of the target domain.
 Investigate the Target Website’s File Metadata
When browsing a target company’s website, you may encounter different types of files 
posted on it, such as files advertising products in JPEG or PDF format, spreadsheets 
containing product catalogs, and others. These files must be downloaded and 
investigated offline to extract their metadata. We already covered metadata in Chapter 2. 
In this section, we will list additional tools to analyze metadata in digital files:
• 
Metagoofil (https://code.google.com/archive/p/metagoofil): 
You can extract the metadata of public documents from a target 
company’s website.
• 
OOMetaExtractor (https://archive.codeplex.
com/?p=oometaextractor): You can extract an OpenOffice 
document’s metadata.

services:
• 
Censys (https://censys.io)
• 
Certificate Search (https://crt.sh)
 Website Statistics and Analytics Tools

about any domain name. You need to supply the target domain name only, and a 
detailed report is generated. The following are the most popular tools in this area:
• 
Alexa (https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo): Offers rich websites 
statistics and analytical info.
•

zone-h.org/archive and search for the target domain name. if there is a 
previous hack, it will show you the hacked page (which replaces the original main 
home page), the hacker team responsible of this hack if available, and the date/
time when the hack took place.
 Passive Technical Reconnaissance Activities
Conducting passive reconnaissance activities for technical information means you are 
trying to identify subdomains, IP addresses, doing DNS footprinting, and getting WHOIS 
information of the target domain. 
 WHOIS Lookup
With a WHOIS lookup, you can find out who registered the target domain name in 
addition to other useful information such as the domain name owner and personal 
information, billing contact, and technical contact address (see Figure 8-5). This 
information is public and required to be so by the ICANN organization responsible 
for overseeing the domain name system. WHOIS information about each domain is 
stored within public central databases called WHOIS databases. These databases can be 
queried to fetch detailed information about any registered domain name. Please note 
that some domain registrants may opt to make their domain registration information 
ChApter 8  teChniCAl Footprinting

private. (This service is called something different by each domain register and require 
paying additional fee, but the most common terms are domain privacy or WHOIS 
protection.) In these cases, the personal information of the domain registrant will be 
hidden in the WHOIS databases.
Numerous sites offer WHOIS information. However, the main one responsible for 
delivering this service is ICANN. ICANN and its local regional Internet registries manage 
the allocation and registration of IP addresses and domain names for the entire world.
• 
ICANN (https://whois.icann.org/en): This is the head 
organization responsible for coordinating the Internet DNS and IP 
addresses.
• 
AFRINIC (https://www.afrinic.net): This is responsible for the 
Africa region.
• 
APNIC (https://www.apnic.net): This is responsible for the Asia- 
Pacific region.
• 
LACNIC (www.lacnic.net): This is responsible for the Latin 
American and the Caribbean.

Many other online services give more information about registered domain names, 
listed here:
• 
Domain History (www.domainhistory.net): This shows archived 
domain name information.
• 
Whoisology (https://whoisology.com/#advanced): This is a domain 
name ownership archive.
• 
Robtext (https://www.robtex.com): This contains various 
information about domain names.
• 
Who (https://who.is): This offers a WHOIS search for domain 
name, website, and IP tools.
• 
Operative Framework (https://github.com/graniet/operative- 
framework): Here you can find all domains registered by the same 
e-mail address.
• 
URL Scan (https://urlscan.io): This shows different information 
about the target website such as IP detail, subdomains, domain trees, 
links, certificates, and technologies used to build it.
Now, after finding out who is responsible for the target domain name, you can begin 
discovering how the target company organizes its Internet resources through web hosts 
and subdomains.
 Subdomain Discovery
A subdomain is a web address created under the current domain name address. It is 
usually used by website administrators to organize their content online. For example, 
www.darknessgate.com can use the subdomain http://shop.darknessagte.com for 
shopping and the subdomain http://blog.darknessgate.com for housing a blog.
Many website administrators may create subdomains to test new technology 
before applying it to the main site. Such sites are insecure because they are used in 
the development stage and could be left open to attack. Discovering such insecure 
subdomains can provide important information about the target company (for example, 
it may reveal the website code or leak documents forgotten on the server).
There are many tools/techniques for subdomain discovery. The following are the 
most popular ones.
ChApter 8  teChniCAl Footprinting

 Using Google Search Operator
Use site:target.com -inurl:www and Google will show all the related subdomain names of 
the target. For example, typing site:yahoo.com -inurl:www will show all the subdomains 
of the target domain name yahoo.com using the Google search page (see Figure 8-6).

discovery
 Using VirusTotal.com
The VirusTotal service checks suspicious files and URLs for malicious code. This service can 
be used for subdomain discovery. Go to https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/search 
(make sure to select the Search tab if it is not already selected). Enter the target domain name 
and press Enter. Scroll to the end of the page to find the “Observed Subdomains” section  
(see Figure 8-7).
