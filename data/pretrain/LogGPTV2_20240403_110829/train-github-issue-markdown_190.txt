# Feature request
Improve typings for the router.
## Describe the solution you'd like
A couple examples:
  * `useRouter` seems to have an `any` return type (because of this line)
    import * as React from 'react'
    import { BaseRouter } from './router/router'
    export const RouterContext = React.createContext(null)
  * `useRouter` should be generic, as well. This involves propagating generics down through to `BaseRouter` (and finally update `query` to `query: ParsedUrlQuery & P`). This is to allow you to specific custom query (URL params, etc).
  * Regression: lost `WithRouterProps` type export from `next/router`
  * Improved `WithRouterProps` typings via generics. See here.
  * (still finding more)
## Describe alternatives you've considered
The only "alternatives" are rolling your own types and asserting e.g.
`router.query as MyQueryType` etc.
