INCIDENT HANDLING STEPS
6 STEPS ARE DEFINED TO HANDLE SECURITY INCIDENTS
1. Preparation: get ready to handle the incident
2. Identification: detect the incident
3. Containment: limit the impact of the incident
4. Remediation: remove the threat
5. Recovery: recover to a normal stage
6. Lessons learned: draw up and improve the process
IRM provides detailed information for each stepof the incident response process.The steps
come from NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.

PREPARATION
OBJECTIVE: ESTABLISH CONTACTS, DEFINE PROCEDURES, GATHER INFORMATION TO SAVE
TIMEDURINGANINCIDENT.
IntrusionDetectionSystems(EDR,NIPS,IPS)
▪ Ensurethatthemonitoringtoolsareup-to-date.
▪ Establishcontactswithyournetworkandsecurityoperationteams.
▪ Makesurethatanalertnotificationprocessisdefinedandwell-knownfromeveryone.
▪ Verifyaccesstothedeviceanditsabilitytowatchconcernedperimeters.
▪ Ensurethatyoucanisolateendpoints,area(withEDRforexampleorFirewall).
Network
▪ Make sure that an inventory of the network access points is available, accessible and up-to-date, if
possible,withversioning.
▪ Make sure that network teams have up to date network maps and configurations with concerned
zonesandoperationalteams.
▪ Lookforpotentialunwantednetworkaccesspointsregularlyandclosethem.
▪ LookforVPNaccessandCloudaccessfromrarelocations.

IDENTIFICATION
OBJECTIVE: DETECT THE INCIDENT, DETERMINE ITS SCOPE, AND INVOLVE THE
APPROPRIATEPARTIES.
Sourcesofdetection:
▪ Notificationbyuser/helpdesk.
▪ IDS/IPS/NIDS/EDRlogs,alertsandreports.
▪ Detectionbynetworkstaff.
▪ Firewallandproxylogs.
▪ Complaintfromanexternalsource.
▪ Honeypotsoranyotherdeceptivesolution.
Recordsuspectnetworkactivity
Network frames can be stored into a file and transmitted to your incident response team for further
analysis.
Use network capture tools (tshark, windump, tcpdump…) to dump malicious traffic. Use a hub or port
mirroringonanaffectedLANtocollectvaluabledata.
Network forensic requires skills and knowledge. Ask your incident response team for assistance or
advice.

Analyzetheattack
▪ AnalyzealertsgeneratedbyyourIDS.
▪ Reviewstatisticsandlogsofnetworkdevices.
▪ Trytounderstandthegoalofthemalicioustrafficandidentifytheinfrastructurecomponentsaffected
byit.
▪ Mapwithbusinessriskstoproperlyprioritizetheanalysisorcontainment.
▪ Identifytraffic’stechnicalcharacteristics:
o SourceIPaddress(es)
o Portsused,TTL,PacketID,…
o Protocolsused
o Targetedmachines/services
o Exploit(s)
o Remoteaccountsloggedin
At the end of this step, the impacted machines and the modus operandi of the attack
shouldhave been identified.Ideally, thesource oftheattack shouldhave beenidentified
aswell.Thisiswhereyoushoulddoyourforensicinvestigations,ifneeded.
If a compromised computer has been identified, check IRM cheat sheets dedicated to
intrusion.

CONTAINMENT
OBJECTIVE:MITIGATETHEATTACK’SEFFECTSONTHETARGETEDENVIRONMENT.
If the issue is considered as strategic (sensitive resource access), a specific crisis
managementcellshouldbeactivated.
Depending on the criticality of the impacted resources, the following steps can be performed and
monitored:
▪ Disconnectthecompromisedareafromthenetwork.
▪ Isolate the source of the attack. Disconnect the affected computer(s) in order to perform further
investigation.
▪ Adopt acceptable mitigation controls (MFA, geo-filtering) for the business-critical flux in agreement
withthebusinesslinemanagers.
▪ Terminateunwantedconnectionsorprocessesonaffectedmachines.
▪ Usefirewall/IPS/EDRrulestoblocktheattack.
▪ UseIDSrulestomatchwiththismaliciousbehaviorandinformtechnicalstaffonnewevents.
▪ Applyadhocactionsincaseofstrategicissue:
o Denyegressdestinationsin EDR,proxiesand/orfirewalls.
o Configure security controls policy management to contain or reject connections from
compromisedmachines.
o Limitaccesstocritical/confidentialdata.
o Createbooby-trappeddocumentswithwatermarkingthatcouldbeusedasaproofoftheft.
o Notifytargetedbusinessusersaboutwhatmustbedoneandwhatisforbidden.
o Configure logging capabilities in verbose mode on targeted environment and store them in a
remotesecureserver.

REMEDIATION
OBJECTIVE: TAKE ACTIONS TO STOP THE MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR.
Blockthesource
▪ Using analysis from previous steps identification and containment, find out all communication
channelsusedbyattackerandblockthemonallyournetworkboundaries.
▪ Ifthesourcehasbeenidentifiedasaninsider,takeappropriateactionandinvolveyourmanagement
and/orHRteamand/orlegalteam.
▪ If the source has been identified as an external offender, consider involving abuse teams and law
enforcementservicesifrequired.
Technicalremediation
▪ Define a remediation process. If necessary, this process can be validated by another structure, like
yourincidentresponseteamforexample.
▪ RemediationstepsfromtheIntrusionIRMs(2-Windowsand3-Linux)canalsobeuseful.
