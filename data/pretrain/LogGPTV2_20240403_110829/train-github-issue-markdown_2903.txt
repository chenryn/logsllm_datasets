  * Electron version: 1.4.15
  * Operating system: Windows 10
I have a simple nodeJS app that has a function to scrape file metadata. Since
scraping metadata can be intensive I made the app run this as a child process
using fork.
    const metaParser = child.fork(  fe.join(__dirname, 'parse-metadata.js'), [jsonLoad]);
When run in main.js the process is successfully created, but immediately
exits. I added some logging to parse-metadata.js and found out that parse-
metadata.js executed successfully and ran long enough to run the first few
lines of code and then exited.
How do I get electron to fork parse-metadata.js and keep it alive until the
end?
