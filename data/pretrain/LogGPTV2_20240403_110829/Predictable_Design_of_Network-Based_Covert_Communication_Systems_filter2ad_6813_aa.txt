Abstract
This paper presents a predictable and quantiﬁable ap-
proach to designing a covert communication system capa-
ble of effectively exploiting covert channels found in the var-
ious layers of network protocols. Two metrics are developed
that characterize the overall system. A measure of proba-
bility of detection is derived using statistical inference tech-
niques. A measure of reliability is developed as the bit er-
ror rate of the combined noisy channel and an appropriate
error-correcting code. To support reliable communication,
a family of error-correcting codes are developed that handle
the high symbol insertion rates found in these covert chan-
nels. The system metrics are each shown to be a function
of the covert channel signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the
two can be used to perform system level design trade-offs.
Validation of the system design methodology is provided by
means of an experiment using real network trafﬁc data.
1. Introduction
Covert channels present an interesting problem in se-
cure system design. Traditional covert channels and asso-
ciated research focus primarily on multi-level secure sys-
tems [6, 15, 19]. Recognizing that complete elimination
of these hidden channels is impossible [20], the classic de-
fense involves some means of ensuring that the bandwidth
(throughput) is reduced to some arbitrarily low number [7].
Network-based covert channels differ from classical covert
channels in that they exploit properties of computer net-
work communication protocols.
In 1987 Girling [11] is
perhaps the ﬁrst to report on network-based covert chan-
nels. Over the next two decades several varieties of exploits
within the various network protocols are revealed. Exam-
ples include [1, 12, 28, 30, 37];
[13, 26] summarize sev-
eral typical exploits. A rigorous analysis of network-based
covert channels has not been pursued to the same extent as
the classic covert channels, and defense against these newer
covert channels is an open area of research. Notable excep-
tions to this last statement are revealed in recent publica-
tions from the US Naval Research Laboratory on channel
capacity analysis [21, 22] and bandwidth restrictions [14].
It has been amply demonstrated that basic storage and
timing covert channels exist that will support a low band-
width one-way communication system in network commu-
nications. However, none of the published research has
offered a rigorous or uniﬁed approach to the design of a
predictably quantiﬁable covert communication system. De-
tectability of the channel is only expressed in qualitative
terms. Informal capacity estimates are often cited, but an
information theoretic analysis of the channel capacity and
channel error types is typically omitted. The reliability of
communications across the channel is rarely expressed or
considered, and the application of coding theory has been
ignored or ad hoc. Interesting system designs are presented
in [1, 3, 4, 10, 31]; however, each suffers from one or more
of the above criticisms, and each is based on a single spe-
ciﬁc type of exploit.
In this paper we present a general purpose methodology
for network-based covert communication system design.
Speciﬁcally we investigate highly stealthy, low-bandwidth
applications. We demonstrate that a predictably measurable
covert communication system can be designed that exploits
certain predictable properties of network communications.
We provide a sound engineering foundation for the design
of undetectable and reliable communication systems hid-
den within existing Internet trafﬁc. A low-bandwidth covert
channel is formed through exploitation of well-chosen net-
work properties. Selection and design of an exploit is
guided by the criteria to minimize probability of detection.
Given an exploit design, the channel is characterized for
both capacity and noise. Based upon the exploit parameters
and the noise characteristics of the channel, an appropriate
coding scheme is devised. The combination of these ac-
tivities yields a covert communication system designed to

achieve predictable levels of both probability of detection
and reliability.
Section II describes a general scenario in which such a
system may be employed, and introduces the concept of
exploit signal-to-noise ratio. Section III presents the the
metrics against which the system design can be measured.
Mathematical representations for system detectability and
reliability are derived. A unique family of trellis codes is
presented as a means of handling the high error rates of
these channels. Section IV introduces a system validation
experiment that demonstrates the effectiveness of the design
methodology. Section V concludes the paper.
2. Background
2.1. Applications
Perhaps the most widely held view of a covert channel
is of a guarded secret being “leaked” to an unintended au-
dience. This view is consistent with the traditional example
of a covert channel in a multi-level secure system where a
Trojan Horse surreptitiously modulates some parameter of
the system visible to some lower-level process.
The introduction of network-based covert channels in-
creases the scope of vulnerable computing systems. Leak-
ing sensitive information is still a primary goal of most
covert channels; however it is not the only application.
Trafﬁc analysis is a potentially new application afforded
by network-based covet channels; covert channels exposed
within assumed secure and anonymous network commu-
nications afford the opportunity for an observer to defeat
some level of the anonymity [21]. Covert channels opened
in one layer of a network may also provide the vehicle for
inﬁltrating higher-level networks. Network-based covert
channels have also been demonstrated to provide new at-
tacker tracing techniques [36, 9].
2.2. Exploits, Channels and Systems
In much of the literature a covert channel refers to both
the technique used to signal hidden messages as well as the
channel formed by such a technique. For the purposes of
this research it is helpful to use separate terms for these
concepts. The term covert exploit, or simply exploit, is used
to refer to the speciﬁc technique used to inject hidden data
into the network packet stream. The term covert channel,
or simply channel, is used to refer to the type of theoretical
communication channel formed by a given technique. To
illustrate the utility of such a naming convention, consider
the following example. Manipulation of the lower order bit
of the Transport Control Protocol timestamp ﬁeld or the ur-
gent ﬂag of the control bits ﬁeld are two potential covert
channel exploits, each with its own merits in terms of ease

Covert Channel
of implementation and detectability. However, both might
yield a very similar covert storage channel in terms of the
channel’s information theoretic properties.
A covert communication system is another term intro-
duced within this research. It refers to the collective set of
the covert exploit(s) and channel, the coding scheme, and
any other modules necessary to effectively use the chan-
nel for communications. The design of covert communica-
tion systems is a central theme of this paper, and it is the
systems-based approach that, in part, makes this research
unique.
2.3. The Attack Scenario
An illustration of an Internet-based covert channel is pro-
vided in Figure 1. Alice, from Enclave A, communicates
legitimately with Bob, from Enclave B. The enclaves use
the Internet as a cost effective communication link and add
some measure of security and anonymity, perhaps a virtual
private network layer. Assume that a Trojan Horse is some-
how installed on Alice’s computer. This malicious software
now modulates the stream of packets sent by Alice in such
a way as to allow an eavesdropper, Eve, to identify Alice’s
transmissions from those of other hosts within enclave A. A
hidden message is then encoded in the modulation scheme
thus allowing secret information to be exﬁltrated from the
enclave. Further, assume that the enclaves are monitored
for suspicious and malicious use of the secured network, by
a warden. The warden is an abstraction of the monitoring
agency whose job it is to ensure that the security of the en-
clave(s) is not jeopardized. In the context of this research,
the warden is assumed to be a powerful monitoring agency,
one with signiﬁcant computing resources; the speciﬁc as-
sumptions are covered in Section III.

Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Consider the following generic storage-based exploit.
The designer of the system chooses a protocol ﬁeld for ex-
ploit that contains NF total ﬁeld values. From this ﬁeld
a subset of NS distinct exploit symbols is chosen wherein
each symbol is represented by some mapping to the exploit
ﬁeld values. Covert signaling is then achieved by injecting
exploit symbols into the network trafﬁc according to an en-
coding scheme. Natural occurrences of the exploit symbols
are assumed to exist in the trafﬁc at the point in the net-
work at which the eavesdropper is listening, and therefore,
all observed exploit symbols are either natural or injected
(signal).
It is important that each exploit symbol have a
non-zero occurrence in the natural trafﬁc, otherwise detec-
tion by the warden would be trivial once unnatural exploit
symbols appeared.
s , and the ratio ν∗
Let νs denote the natural proportion of exploit symbols
in normal trafﬁc; ie, the proportion without any covert sig-
naling present. Let ν∗
s denote the proportion of covert (in-
jected) symbols within the exploited network trafﬁc. Dur-
ing a period of covert signaling, the observable proportion
of exploit symbols is νs + ν∗
s /νs becomes
a key system design parameter; call this parameter the ex-
ploit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A small SNR implies that
few covert symbols are added to the network trafﬁc, thus
detection of the signaling by the warden is difﬁcult. How-
ever, a small SNR also implies a slow transmission rate and
poor reliability of the received message by the eavesdrop-
per since Eve will have difﬁculty discriminating the exploit
symbols from the naturally occurring ones. Conversely, a
very large ν∗
s /νs increases the transmission rate and the re-
liability, but now at the expense of detectability.

rameters
3.1. Detecting a Covert Channel
In this subsection a set of underlying assumptions are
made about the warden. Based upon these assumptions a
measure of the probability of detection is proposed that is a
function of the exploit signal-to-noise ratio.
It is impossible to know the extent to which any war-
den will go to protect an enclave from covert channels. A
common assumption under this scenario is that the warden
is no more suspicious of one host than another [10]. The
implication being that no host within the enclave, including
the covert sender, is subject to forensic investigation or is
deemed untrustworthy. Without this assumption no exploit
is possible, as the sender Trojan may likely be found. A sec-
ond assumption is that the warden attempts to detect covert
messaging by monitoring the trafﬁc across the network. The
313
type of monitoring ranges from simple signature based de-
tection schemes to statistical anomaly detection. Signature
based detection techniques are relatively easy to implement
and therefore must be assumed to exist on any network of
interest to this study. Therefore, any exploit design must be
signature-free. A wise warden will also realize this fact, and
thus a further assumption is that any meaningful monitoring
by the warden must involve anomaly detection techniques.
Speciﬁcally this implies that the modulation of the exploit
ﬁeld values must not produce a signature and must not ap-
pear anomalous in order to be undetectable.
It is argued
here that traditional anomaly detection techniques will not
detect the covert channels proposed herein since by their
very design they contain no signature and violate no proto-
col usage. It is not sufﬁcient however to suggest that they
are undetectable. Instead a measure of detectability is pro-
posed under the assumption that if a warden suspected such
covert channels, they would employ the most appropriate
anomaly detection; even if that is not currently the practice.
The detection of an anomaly is by deﬁnition a probabilistic
event, and it is with this in mind that detectability is ex-
plored.
Application of traditional hypothesis testing techniques
to covert (steganographic) channels is not new [5]. A com-
mon technique within statistical quality control involves
comparing some attribute(s) within a known process to the
attribute in other instances of the process. This technique al-
lows for subtle changes in the process to be detectable. Re-
