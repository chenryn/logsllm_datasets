You should now have VirtualBox Guest Additions installed. You can test this by resizing the screen. If you 
make the Ubuntu VM full screen, you should see the overall screen resolution change with it If you changed 
the scaling of the window previously, change it back to 100%. If all appears to be functioning, you can right­
click the CD icon in the left Dock and choose "Eject". If not, double-click the CD icon and choose "Run 
Software" in the upper right corner to repeat the process. Next, we should make some modifications within the 
VirtualBox program in order to experience better functionality. Shut down the Ubuntu VM by clicking on the 
down arrow in the upper right and choosing the power button, followed by "Shut down". In VirtualBox, select 
your Ubuntu VM and click the "Settings" icon. Next, conduct the following steps.
You should now have a more robust display, copy and paste capabilities, and a new shared folder connecting 
your VM to your host on the Desktop. You can copy files from your VM directly to your host and vice versa. 
This has improved a lot of function, and now it is time to personalize the machine. Personally, I do not like the 
default colors and wallpaper of Ubuntu, and prefer something more professional. Ubuntu 20 removed the ability 
to easily change wallpaper to a solid color, so we will do it all through Terminal. I conducted the following on 
my new VM.
• 
In the "General" icon, click on the "Advanced" tab.
• 
Change "Shared clipboard" and "Drag n' Drop" to "Bidirectional".
• 
In the "Display" icon, change the Video Memory to the maximum.
• 
In the "Shared Folders" icon, click the green "+".
• 
Click the dropdown menu under "Folder Path" and select "Other".
• 
Choose a desired folder on your host to share data back and forth.
• 
Select the "Auto-mount" option and then "OK".
• 
Click "OK" to close the settings window.
• 
Restan your Ubuntu VM.
• 
Click the nine dots in the lower-left to open the "Applications" menu. Search "Terminal" and open the 
application. In it, type sudo adduser osint vboxsf and press enter. When prompted, provide 
your password, which is not revealed in the window as you type, and press enter.

You now have the Terminal and Software Updater in your Dock for easy access. Check for updates weekly and 
keep your original copy ready for usage. This brings us to a conversation about the term "Original". Ideally, you 
will keep a copy of this VM clean and free of any internet usage or contamination. There are two ways to achieve 
this, and both have unique benefits. First, let's discuss Snapshots.
• 
Launch the Applications menu (nine dots in lower-left).
• 
Type Terminal into the search field.
• 
Right-click on the application and select "Add to Favorites".
• 
Type Software into the search field and right-click on "Software Updater".
• 
Select "Add to Favorites".
• 
Press escape until all windows are gone.
• 
Launch the Software Updater icon from the Dock; click "Install Now"; and update all options.
• 
In the VirtualBox Menu, click on the "Snapshots" button in the upper right.
• 
Click on the blue camera icon to "take a snapshot".
• 
Create a name to remind you of the state of the machine, such as "New Install".
• 
Click OK.
A great feature of virtual machines is the use of Snapshots. These "frozen" moments in time allow you to reven 
to an original configuration or preserve an optimal setup. Most users install the virtual machine as detailed 
previously, and then immediately create a snapshot of the unused environment. When your virtual machine 
eventually becomes contaminated with remnants of other investigations, or you accidentally remove or break a 
feature, you can simply revert to the previously created snapshot and eliminate the need to ever reinstall. 
Consider how you might use snapshots, as detailed in the following pages.
Upon creation of a new Ubuntu virtual machine, apply all updates as previously mentioned. Completely shut 
down the machine and open the Snapshots option within your virtual machine software. Create a new snapshot 
and title it "Original". Use this machine for a single investigation, and export all evidence to an external USB 
device, such as a flash drive. You can then "restore" the Original snapshot, and it overwrites any changes made 
during the previous investigation. Upon reboot, all history and evidence is eliminated. This ensures that you 
never contaminate one investigation with another. When there are substantial updates available for Ubuntu, you 
can load the default configuration, and apply all updates. You can then shut the machine down completely and 
delete the Original snapshot, without saving it, and create a new snapshot tided Original. This new snapshot 
possesses all of the updates. If using this technique, I usually delete and create a new snapshot weekly. The use 
of snapshots is very similar between VirtualBox and VMWare, but let's take a look at the minor differences.
It is important to keep the software on this original VM updated. There are different ways to do this, but I will 
focus on the easiest way within the operating system applications. While we do this, it may be a good time to 
add some commonly used applications to our Dock. Conduct the following steps.

• 
Completely shut down the Virtual Machine.
• 
In the VirtualBox Menu, click on "Snapshots" and select the desired snapshot to apply.
• 
Click on the blue camera icon with arrow to "restore snapshot".
• 
Deny the option to save the current data, and click Restore.
• 
Completely shut down the Virtual Machine.
• 
In the VMWare Menu, click on "Snapshots" and click the camera icon to "take" a snapshot.
• 
Create a name to remind you of the state of the machine, such as "New Install" and click "Take".
• 
Completely shut down the Virtual Machine.
• 
In the VMWare Menu, click on the "Snapshots" button in the upper right
• 
Select the desired snapshot to apply.
• 
Click on the camera icon with arrow to "restore" a snapshot and click Restore.
• 
Launch the Original VM weekly to apply updates or global changes, then close the VM.
• 
In the VirtualBox menu, right-click on the Original VM and select "Clone".
• 
Create a new name such as Case #19-87445 and click "Continue" (or "Next") then "Clone".
You can now use your virtual machine as normal. If you ever want to revert to the exact state of the machine 
that existed at the time of the snapshot, follow these instructions:

Snapshots (VMWare): VMWare is not free, but a license can be purchased for under SI00. In my experience, 
VMWare performs better than VirtualBox with less frustration. If you find yourself relying on VMs for your 
daily investigations, I believe a paid license is justified. I focus on VirtualBox due to the price (free). VMWare 
does offer free versions of this software titled Workstation Player (Windows) and Fusion Player (Mac). However, 
these versions are severely limited. You cannot create snapshots or clone VMs. If you plan to create a VM 
without the need to copy or preserve the state, then this product may work for you.
If you ever want to preserve a specific state of Ubuntu, you can export an entire session. This may be important 
if you are preserving your work environment for court purposes. When I am conducting an investigation that 
may go to trial, or discovery of evidence will be required, I make an exact copy of the operating system used 
during the investigation. At the end of my work, 1 shut down the machine. I click on "File" and then "Export" 
within my virtual machine software and create a copy of the entire operating system exactly as it appeared at 
shutdown. This file can be imported later and examined. After a successful export, 1 restore my clean "Original" 
snapshot and I am ready for the next case. The exported file is added to my digital evidence on an external drive. 
I now know that I can defend any scrutiny by recreating the exact environment during the original examination. 
As stated previously, 1 prefer Clones over Snapshots. I create an exact replica of my original VM for every7 
investigation, and never use Snapshots within these unique VMs. For clarity, consider my routine for every 
OS1NT investigation I conduct, which takes advantage of the "Clone" option within VirtualBox.
If you ever want to remove a snapshot, simply use the "delete" icon. Today, I rarely use snapshots, as 1 believe 
they are prone to user error. 1 much prefer Cloned machines. These require more disk space, but provide a 
greater level of usability between investigations. Examples are explained in greater detail in a later chapter.
Optionally, if you ever want to remove a snapshot, simply click the icon with a red "X". This will remove data 
files to eliminate wasted space, but you cannot restore to that image once removed. It will not impact the current 
machine state. Many users remove old, redundant snapshots after creating newer clean machines.

I wish I could say that even’ reader will be able to easily build virtual machines on any computer. This is simply 
not the case. While most computers are capable of virtual machine usage, many demand slight modifications in 
order to allow virtualization. Let's take a look at the most common errors presented by VirtualBox.
This creates an identical copy of the VM ready for your investigation. You have no worries of contaminating 
your original VM. You can keep this clone available for as long as needed while you continue to work within 
several investigations. You can export the clone in order to preserve evidence, or delete it when finished. Neither 
action touches the original copy. It is similar to possessing a new computer for every case and having all of them 
at your disposal whenever you want to jump back into an investigation.
VT-x is disabled: Any version of this error is the most common reason your VMs will not start. This indicates 
that the processor of your computer either does not support virtualization or the feature is not enabled. The fix 
for this varies by brand of machine and processor. Immediately after the computer is turned on, before the 
operating system starts, enter the BIOS of the machine. This is usually accomplished by pressing delete, F2, F10, 
or another designated key right away until a BIOS menu appears. Once in the BIOS, you can navigate through 
the menu via keyboard. With many Intel processors, you can open the "Advanced" tab and set the "Virtualization 
(VT-x)" to "Enable". For AMD processors, open the "M.I.T." tab, "Advanced Frequency" Settings, "Advanced 
Core" settings, and then set the "SVM Mode" to "Enable". If none of these options appear, conduct an online 
search of the model of your computer followed by "virtualization" for instructions.
Apple Ml Issues: A new Mac computer with an Ml processor may cause a lot of frustration. This is due to the 
conflicts between the chip and the VM operating systems. Once the bugs are worked out with VirtualBox, 
VMWare Fusion, and Parallels in 2022,1 expect to see functioning Ubuntu virtual machines for Ml devices. 
However, this will likely require the ARM version of Ubuntu. I will provide any updates on my podcast.
Your original VM should only be used to install new software and apply updates. Throughout the next several 
chapters, I will reveal more about my usage protocols. Hopefully, you now have either VirtualBox or VMWare 
installed and an Ubuntu installation created as a virtual machine. You have chosen to either use Snapshots or 
Clones as part of your investigation (I prefer Clones). Now it is time to play with the many applications available 
for Linux. We should start with the most important application we have - web browsers.
VT-x is not available: This is usually isolated to Windows 10 machines. Navigate to the Windows Control 
Panel and open "Programs and Features". Click "Turn Windows features on or off' and uncheck all "Hyper-V" 
features. Click "OK" and reboot. If the Hyper-V option is not enabled, enable Hyper-V, restart the computer, 
disable Hyper-V, and reboot again. Attempt to start your VM with these new settings. This may seem backwards, 
but it makes sense. Previous versions of VirtualBox cannot run if you are using "Hyper-V" in Windows. 
Basically, both systems try to get exclusive access to the virtualization capabilities of the processor. Hyper-V 
within Windows receives the access first and impedes VirtualBox from the capabilities. The latest version of 
VirtualBox attempts to correct this. If the previous setting did not help, tty to re-enable all of the Hyper-V 
options within Windows, reboot, and try to boot your VM again. If you are still experiencing problems, read the 
troubleshooting chapter of the VirtualBox manual at virtualbox.org/manual/chl2.html. Expand any errors 
received and search the provided error codes to identify further solutions.
VirtualBox Displays: Some readers of previous editions have reported the inability to resize VM windows 
within VirtualBox and the "Auto-resize Guest Display" menu option greyed out. The following commands 
within Terminal of the Linux VM should repair this issue. There is no harm running these if you are unsure.
Firefox (mozilla.org)
Web Browsers

If you are a Windows user, your default web browser is either Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge. Apple users 
are presented Safari by default. I believe OSINT professionals should avoid these at all costs. All are inferior in 
my opinion, and you will encounter difficulties with some of the websites and sendees mentioned later. 
Therefore, we need a better browser.
For the purposes of this chapter, I will assume you are configuring the Firefox application included in your new 
Ubuntu VM. However, all of the methods explained here could be replicated within your host or any other 
computer. If you will be using your host computer for any web browsing, Firefox is highly recommended as the 
default browser. Regardless of where you will be conducting your online investigations, have a properly 
configured Firefox application.
• 
Click on the menu in the upper right and select "Settings", "Options", or "Preferences".
• 
In the "General" options, uncheck both "Recommend extensions as you browse" and "Recommend 
features as you browse". This prevents some internet usage information from being sent to Firefox.
• 
In the "Home" options, change "Homepage and new windows" and "New tabs" to "Blank page". This 
prevents Firefox from loading their sendees in new pages and tabs.
• 
Disable all Firefox "Home Content" options.
• 
In the "Privacy & Security" options, enable "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed". This 
cleans things up when you exit the browser.
• 
Uncheck all options under "Logins and Passwords".
• 
Change the History setting to "Firefox will use custom settings for history".
• 
Uncheck the box tided "Remember browsing and download history".
The most vital application in this chapter is the Firefox web browser. Most of the search methods that you will 
learn throughout this book must be conducted within a web browser. The Firefox browser has enhanced security 
and a feature called "add-ons" or "extensions". These are small applications which work within the browser that 
perform a specific function. They will make searching and documentation much easier. I also use the Chrome 
web browser when necessary, and will explain some customizations later. However, many of the extensions that 
I need are only compatible with Firefox. The following instructions apply to any recent version of Firefox, 
including builds for Windows, Mac, and Linux (Firefox is already installed in Ubuntu).
Downloading and installing Firefox is no different than any other application. Detailed directions are readily 
available on their website. The browser will not look much different from the browser you were previously 
using. When installing and executing, choose not to import any settings from other browsers. This will keep 
your browser clean from unwanted data. The next step is to ensure your browser is up to date. You can check 
your version of Firefox by clicking on the Menu button in the upper right (three horizontal lines), then the Help 
button (?), and finally the option labeled "About Firefox". This will open a new window that will display the 
version of Firefox you are running, or a warning that the version you have is out of date.
Before identifying Firefox resources which will aid in our OSINT research, we must first secure our browser to 
the best of our ability. While the default Firefox installation is much more private and secure than most other 
browsers, we should still consider some modifications. I personally use Firefox for all of my OSINT 
investigations in my VMs, and as my default web browser on my personal laptop. I no longer possess multiple 
browsers for various tasks. I believe that Firefox is the most robust, secure, and appropriate option for almost 
any scenario. However, 1 recommend changing the following settings within Firefox.
