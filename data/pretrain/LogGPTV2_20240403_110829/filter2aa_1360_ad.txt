```

#### Installing and Testing VirtualBox Guest Additions
You should now have VirtualBox Guest Additions installed. To test this, resize the screen. If you make the Ubuntu VM full screen, the overall screen resolution should change accordingly. If you previously changed the scaling of the window, reset it to 100%. If everything is functioning correctly, right-click the CD icon in the left Dock and choose "Eject." If not, double-click the CD icon and select "Run Software" in the upper right corner to repeat the installation process.

#### Enhancing VirtualBox Functionality
Next, we will make some modifications within the VirtualBox program to improve functionality. Follow these steps:

1. **Shut Down the VM:**
   - Click on the down arrow in the upper right corner and choose the power button, then "Shut Down."

2. **Modify Settings:**
   - In VirtualBox, select your Ubuntu VM and click the "Settings" icon.
   - In the "General" section, click on the "Advanced" tab.
   - Change "Shared Clipboard" and "Drag and Drop" to "Bidirectional."
   - In the "Display" section, set the Video Memory to the maximum.
   - In the "Shared Folders" section, click the green "+" button.
   - Under "Folder Path," select "Other" and choose a desired folder on your host to share data.
   - Select the "Auto-mount" option and click "OK."
   - Click "OK" to close the settings window.

3. **Restart the VM:**
   - Restart your Ubuntu VM.
   - Open the "Applications" menu (nine dots in the lower-left corner), search for "Terminal," and open it.
   - Type `sudo adduser osint vboxsf` and press `Enter`. When prompted, provide your password and press `Enter`.

#### Configuring Privacy and Power Settings
To enhance privacy and power settings, follow these steps:

1. **Privacy Settings:**
   - Click on "Privacy," then "Screen Lock," and disable all options.
   - Click "File History & Trash," and disable any options.
   - Click "Diagnostics," and change to "Never."

2. **Power Settings:**
   - Click the back arrow and go to "Power."
   - Change "Blank Screen" to "Never."
   - Disable "Automatic Suspend."

3. **Close All Settings Windows:**
   - Close all open settings windows.

#### Adding Terminal and Software Updater to the Dock
For easy access, add the Terminal and Software Updater to your Dock:

1. **Add Terminal:**
   - Launch the Applications menu (nine dots in the lower-left corner).
   - Type "Terminal" into the search field.
   - Right-click on the application and select "Add to Favorites."

2. **Add Software Updater:**
   - Type "Software" into the search field.
   - Right-click on "Software Updater" and select "Add to Favorites."
   - Press `Escape` until all windows are gone.

3. **Update Software:**
   - Launch the Software Updater icon from the Dock.
   - Click "Install Now" and update all options.

#### Using Snapshots
Snapshots allow you to revert to a previous state of your virtual machine. Hereâ€™s how to create and manage snapshots:

1. **Create a Snapshot:**
   - In the VirtualBox Menu, click on the "Snapshots" button in the upper right.
   - Click on the blue camera icon to "take a snapshot."
   - Create a name to remind you of the state of the machine, such as "New Install."
   - Click "OK."

2. **Restore a Snapshot:**
   - In the VirtualBox Menu, click on "Snapshots" and select the desired snapshot to apply.
   - Click on the blue camera icon with an arrow to "restore snapshot."
   - Deny the option to save the current data and click "Restore."

#### Cloning Virtual Machines
Clones provide a more robust way to preserve specific states of your VM:

1. **Clone a VM:**
   - In the VirtualBox menu, right-click on the Original VM and select "Clone."
   - Create a new name, such as "Case #19-87445," and click "Continue" (or "Next") then "Clone."

2. **Use and Manage Clones:**
   - You can now use your cloned VM as normal.
   - If you need to revert to the exact state of the machine that existed at the time of the snapshot, follow the restore instructions above.

#### Exporting and Importing VMs
To preserve a specific state of Ubuntu, you can export an entire session:

1. **Export a VM:**
   - Shut down the machine.
   - Click on "File" and then "Export" within your virtual machine software.
   - Create a copy of the entire operating system exactly as it appeared at shutdown.
   - This file can be imported later and examined.

2. **Import a VM:**
   - Restore your clean "Original" snapshot and import the exported file when needed.

#### Troubleshooting Common Errors
If you encounter errors, try the following solutions:

1. **VT-x is Disabled:**
   - Enter the BIOS of your machine (usually by pressing `Delete`, `F2`, `F10`, or another designated key).
   - Enable "Virtualization (VT-x)" for Intel processors or "SVM Mode" for AMD processors.

2. **VT-x is Not Available:**
   - Navigate to the Windows Control Panel and open "Programs and Features."
   - Uncheck all "Hyper-V" features and reboot.
   - If the issue persists, re-enable Hyper-V, restart, disable it again, and reboot.

3. **VirtualBox Displays:**
   - Run the following commands in the Terminal of the Linux VM:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms gcc make perl
     sudo rcvboxadd setup
     reboot
     ```

#### Configuring Firefox for OSINT
Firefox is the recommended web browser for OSINT. Follow these steps to secure and configure it:

   - Modify the following settings in `about:config`:
     - `geo.enabled`: `FALSE`
     - `dom.battery.enabled`: `FALSE`
     - `extensions.pocketenabled`: `FALSE`
     - `browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.section.highlights.includePocket`: `FALSE`
