User: I'm uncertain whether to use pty.fork() or os.fork() when spawning external background processes from my app. (Such as chess engines)
I want the spawned processes to die if the parent is killed, as with spawning apps in a terminal.
What are the ups and downs between the two forks?
Assistant: Pseudotermials are necessary for some applications that really expect a terminal. An interactive shell is one of these examples but there are many other. The pty.fork option is not there as another os.fork but as a specific API to use a pseudoterminal.
