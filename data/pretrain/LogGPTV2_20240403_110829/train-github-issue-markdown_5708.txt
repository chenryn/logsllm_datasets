**Current behavior**  
This is more a stylistic thing, but
    this.renderer.setElementAttribute(this.el.nativeElement, 'data-some-param', undefined);
is a legal usage as it deletes data-some-param attribute from element, but
this code shows typescript error when using strictNullChecks because
setElementAttribute is described as:
    abstract setElementAttribute(renderElement: any, attributeName: string, attributeValue: string): void;
attributeValue is just `string` and not `string | undefined`
**Expected behavior**
attributeValue to have type `string | undefined`  
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
