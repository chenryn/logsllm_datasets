User: I have a python script which I have made dropable using a registry-key, but it does not seem to work. The cmd.exe window just flashes by, can I somehow make the window stay up, or save the output?
EDIT: the problem was that it gave the whole path not only the filename.
Assistant: Either right-click your script and remove Program->Close on exit checkbox in its properties, or use cmd /k as part of its calling line.
Think twice before introducing artificial delays or need to press key - this will make your script mostly unusable in any unattended/pipe calls.
