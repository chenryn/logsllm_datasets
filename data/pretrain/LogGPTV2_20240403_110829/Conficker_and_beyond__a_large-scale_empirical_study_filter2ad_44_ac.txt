Besides sending DDoS packets and spam emails, a botnet
can steal sensitive information from victims [11].
If hosts
infected by a bot belong to critical networks such as gov-
ernment and military networks that contain sensitive infor-
mation, a botmaster can steal important information from
them. Using our Conﬁcker data, we investigated how many
victims are aﬃliated with government or military networks
and we found 714 such victims. Surprisingly, victims in gov-
ernment networks are not limited to a few countries, instead
they are spread around 70 countries including U.S.A., Park-
istan, India and China. Also, we investigated how many
victims are in well-known companies. To do this, we used
the Fortune 100 Company List [8] and we found 2,847 such
hosts. Conﬁcker victims still exist within several reputable
companies such as HP and IBM.
Insight from Result 3, 3.1 and 3.2.
(Watch out
for new and sensitive Domains!) It is nearly impossible
to monitor all domain names. However, we have observed
that newly registered domains are more vulnerable and more
easily infected by Conﬁcker. Hence, it is necessary to closely
monitor those recently registered domains. In addition, even
though the number of victims is not large, a botmaster of
Conﬁcker can steal sensitive information from government
and top rated company networks.
4.3 Distribution over Bandwidth
Besides IP address, AS and domain names, bandwidth
gives us information that shows us what kinds of networks
Conﬁcker victims belong to.

power of the botnet. For instance, if we know there are one
million Conﬁcker victims in the world and most Conﬁcker
victims are in networks with bandwidth less than 1 Kbps,
we deduce that it could generate 1 Gbps traﬃc in the best
case. To measure the bandwidth, we use Tmetric [27] which
sends ICMP packets to the target network and provides a
measured bandwidth result. Since Tmetric needs to con-
tact the target network to estimate the bandwidth, we can
not get the bandwidth result without live target networks
and hosts. It takes quite a long time to contact each host
and measure the bandwidth, so we only contact one host in
the subnetworks (/24) where Conﬁcker victims exist. We
reasonably assume that hosts in the same subnetwork (/24)
have the same bandwidth.
Result 4. (Bandwidth Distribution) About 99% of
Conﬁcker victims have bandwidth less than 1 Mbps and this
means that most of them are ADSL or Modem/Dialup users.
We ﬁnd that most victims are using Modem/Dialup or
ADSL networks. As shown in Figure 2 (a), about 90% of
Conﬁcker victims are in the network whose bandwidth is less
than 200 Kbps and around 99% of victims are residing in the
network whose bandwidth is less than 1 Mbps. This result
is similar to [10] and [31] which denote most bots are using
ADSL or Dialup networks. When we conducted this mea-
surement, we found interesting patterns between the band-
width of a subnet and the number of infected hosts in the
subnet.
Result 4.1.
(Bandwidth Distribution - relation
with the numbers of victims) The networks that have
low bandwidth are likely to have more Conﬁcker victims than
those with high bandwidth.
We suspect that there is a relationship between the band-
width of a network and the number of infected hosts of the
network. As shown in Figure 2 (b), the bandwidth of the
subnet is inversely related to the number of infected hosts
in the subnet. We think that this pattern is related to the
manageability of each network. A network with high band-
width indicates consuming high setup cost and it also means
the network is that worthy. And we could infer that such
worthy network is under reasonably good maintenance.
Insight from Result 4 and 4.1. (Examine ADSL
or Modem/Dialup networks) Hosts with ADSL or Mo-
dem/Dialup connections are still very vulnerable.
4.4 Distribution over Geographic Location
Result 5. (Geographic Location) 34.47% of infected
hosts are located in China, which is larger than the total
number of Conﬁcker victims from the next top eight coun-
tries.
As shown in Table 6 on the distribution over countries,
the top ten countries include over 70% of Conﬁcker victims,
China ranks number one by a large margin. Conﬁcker vic-
tims are distributed over most of the world including Asia,
Europe, and South America, but interestingly, only 1.1% of
victims are located in North America. This result is some-
what diﬀerent from previous infection patterns.
Result 5.1. (Geographic Location - Comparison)
In previous worms and botnets, most the infected hosts were
located in North America - especially in USA, but in Con-
ﬁcker, most victims are located in the Asian region - espe-
cially in China.
We compare the country distribution with that of other
worms and bots to determine whether it is diﬀerent or sim-
ilar and we ﬁnd that the location of heavy malware contrib-
utors is changing. Even though we could not get the exact
country distribution from the previous work [18] [31], we are
able to estimate which country had more victims based on
their distribution over ASes. From Table 6 and 3, we ob-
serve that worms prevalent several years ago were mainly
located in North America. In previous botnets, [31] and [32]
show that victims are mainly located in both Asia and North
America, but [18] and [24] denote that most victims are lo-
cated in North America. However, contrast to the results
of previous work, we ﬁnd that Conﬁcker victims are mainly
located in Asia and not in North America, where only 1.1%
of victims are located. Therefore, changing monitoring focus
from North America to Asia seems reasonable.
Insight from Result 5 and 5.1. (From North Amer-
ica to Asia - Conﬁrmed) We clearly observe that the hosts
infected by Conﬁcker are mainly located in Asia and not in
North America, as also shown in Result 2 and 2.1.

based detection systems detect Conﬁcker. A DNS blacklist
is an eﬀective approach to detect malicious hosts and net-
works based on reputation [1]. We investigate how well it
detects Conﬁcker victims to verify its eﬀectiveness. Also,
we examine other reputation-based detection systems such
as Dshield [6] and FIRE [7] to check if they could successfully
detect Conﬁcker victims.
bution of Conﬁcker victims (over IP address space, ASes,
Domain names and Countries) is diﬀerent from the previ-
ous work, and this makes it hard to build eﬀective blacklists
for detecting emerging malicious hosts/networks, because
blacklists highly depend on the reputation of hosts and net-
works obtained from their previous records (and currently
heavily rely on spam activity records).
5.1 DNS Blacklist
We have investigated several well-known blacklists such
as DNSBL [5], SORBS [20], SpamHaus [22], and SpamCop
[21] to see how many victims of Conﬁcker are on their black-
lists. We tested all 24,912,492 infected hosts and we found
out that only 4,281,069 hosts are on blacklists which is only
17.18% of all victims.
Result 6. (DNS Blacklist) DNS blacklists only cover
a small portion of Conﬁcker victims. More speciﬁcally, only
17.18% of Conﬁcker victims are found on any of four DNS
blacklists.
Our investigation result is quite diﬀerent from the previ-
ous work [18] which shows about 80% of bot infected hosts
