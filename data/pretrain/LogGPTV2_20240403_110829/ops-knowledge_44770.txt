User: I am trying to run a command exe from Python while passing in parameters. I have looked at a few other question, and the reason why my question is different is because I first want to call a cmd exe program while passing in some parameters, then I have to wait for 10 sec for the exe to prompt me for some username, and then some password. then I want to pipe this output out to a file. 
So is there a way to pass more arguments if a process is already called previously?
How do I make a cmd exe stay open, because as soon as I call it, the process dies. 
Thanks
Assistant: Take a look at subprocess communicate and pipe examples.
