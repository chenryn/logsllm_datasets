### Observations:
- Web sites S17 and S28 have abnormally high identification durations of approximately 10 seconds, primarily due to very slow responses from these sites.

## 5.2.2. Second Set of Experiments

In the first set of experiments, only two web sites had useful persistent cookies. To further examine CookiePicker's ability to correctly identify useful persistent cookies, we conducted a second set of experiments. Since there is no existing list of web sites with truly useful persistent cookies, we manually selected 200 web sites that use persistent cookies from 15 categories on directory.google.com. The 30 web sites from the first set of experiments were excluded from this selection.

After a thorough manual examination, we identified six web sites (P1 to P6) whose persistent cookies are genuinely useful to users, meaning that without these cookies, users would face significant issues. Due to the labor-intensive nature of this process, we could not locate more such web sites.

| Web Site | Marked Useful by CookiePicker | Real Useful via Manual Verification | NTreeSim(A, B, 5) | NTextSim(S1, S2) | Usage |
|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| P1       | 1                             | 1                                  | 0.311             | 0.609            | Preference |

| P4       | 1                             | 1                                  | 0.250             | 0.158            | Preference |
| P5       | 9                             | 5                                  | 0.226             | 0.253            | Sign Up |
| P6       | 5                             | 2                                  | 0.593             | 0.719            | Preference |
| Average  | -                             | -                                  | 0.418             | 0.521            | -     |

### Observations:
- For the six web sites, all their useful persistent cookies were correctly marked as "useful" by CookiePicker.
- Web sites P5 and P6 had some useless persistent cookies marked as "useful" because they were sent in the same regular request as the real useful cookies.
- The similarity scores computed by NTreeSim(A, B, 5) and NTextSim(S1, S2) are below 0.85, which is the current threshold value used in the system.

### Summary
The two sets of experiments show that by setting Thresh1 and Thresh2 to 0.85, CookiePicker can safely disable and remove persistent cookies from most web sites (25 out of 30). All useful persistent cookies were correctly identified, and no backward error recovery was needed for the 8 web sites (S6, S16, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6) with useful persistent cookies. About 10% of web sites (3 out of 30) with useless persistent cookies were incorrectly identified as "useful." This number may be reduced with further fine-tuning of the thresholds and algorithms.

## 5.3. Evasion against CookiePicker

CookiePicker identifies useful cookies based on perceivable changes on a web page. Potential evasion could come from:
- Web site operators who want to track user activities.
- Attackers who want to steal cookies.

For legitimate web sites, operators might evade CookiePicker by detecting and manipulating hidden HTTP requests. However, most operators are unlikely to do so due to lack of interest or inaccuracy in cookie-based tracking. Third-party attackers would find it difficult to manipulate web pages unless they compromise a legitimate web site.

## 6. Related Work

- **RFC 2109**: Raised awareness of cookie privacy issues.
- **Same Origin Policy**: Introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 to prevent interference between different sites' cookies and JavaScripts.
- **Modern Web Browsers**: Provide refined cookie privacy options, but studies show these are often underutilized due to complexity and lack of user understanding.
- **Doppelganger**: A system for creating and enforcing fine-grained privacy-preserving cookie policies, but it has high overhead and requires human involvement.
- **CookiePicker**: Follows Doppelganger's principle of comparing web page differences but operates fully automatically with lower overhead.

## 7. Conclusions

CookiePicker is a system that automatically manages cookie usage settings for users. It generates one additional HTTP request to identify the usefulness of a cookie set. The core of CookiePicker consists of two complementary detection algorithms that accurately detect HTML page differences caused by enabling and disabling cookies. Useful cookies are classified as those causing perceivable changes, while the rest are disabled. Implemented as a Firefox extension, CookiePicker helps users balance easy usage and privacy risks, with potential for widespread adoption due to its automatic nature, high accuracy, and low overhead.
