ABSTRACT
Computer systems are commonly attacked by malicious trans-
port contacts. We present a comparative study that analyzes
to what extent those attacks depend on the network access,
in particular if an adversary targets speciﬁcally on mobile
or non-mobile devices. Based on a mobile honeypot that
extracts ﬁrst statistical results, our ﬁndings indicate that a
few topological domains of the Internet have started to place
particular focus on attacking mobile networks.

INTRODUCTION
Common attacks on Internet devices start with a connec-
tion to a random or particular TCP/UDP port. An adver-
sary attempts to perform a denial of service (DoS) attack or
to overcome system barriers with the intend to gain unau-
thorized access. The attack gets more eﬀective when the
attacker exploits a speciﬁc vulnerability of the target.
Mobile phones are particularly threatened by attacks. Their
limited hardware resources allow for easy DoS disruptions,
and the local system protection is less mature as compared
to notebooks or PCs. However, it still remains an open ques-
tion whether typical adversaries conduct context-speciﬁc port
scans for intrusions.
In this paper, we report on a mobile honeypot, which col-
lects external requests to an end device connected by a mo-
bile operator. We compare the measurements of more than
one month with the logs of four probes that are attached
to diﬀerent (non-mobile) ISPs. Our analysis reveals that a
mobile device on average suﬀers from the same amount of
attacks as a home network device. However, the distribution
of attacks across autonomous systems, as well as the number

of attackers from the same ASes is signiﬁcantly more pro-
nounced and could indicate Internet regions that specialize
on attacking mobiles.
Current studies focused on the identiﬁcation of attacker-
friendly ASes [3] or the network-level behaviour of spam-
mers [2] but did not diﬀerentiate between mobile and sta-
tionary access. Work in the ﬁeld of mobile honeypots [1]
deals with the secure implementation of honeypots on smart-
phones. We are not aware of any attack analysis based on a
mobile honeypot.
2. MOBILE HONEYPOT
2.1 Background & Design
A honeypot is a trap for collecting data from unauthorized
system access—in this analysis via IP—initiated by remote
parties. Its intention is to learn about the nature and the
characteristics of attacks. The novel term mobile honeypot
is not yet well-deﬁned.
It is used for a probe that either
(a) resides on a mobile device, (b) is running on a mobile
operating system, or (c) is operated in the network of mo-
bile devices. We argue that remote attacks are bound to
the network layer and moreover do not focus on speciﬁcs of
mobile hardware, but solely target at the system level.
For the mobile honeypot, we build our subsequent anal-
ysis of monitoring attacks on a Linux-based system that is
connected to a mobile operator network for two reasons:
First, a major part of currently deployed smartphones runs
Android, which makes this platform appropriate for obser-
vations. However, current OS ﬁngerprinting tools such as
Nmap or Xprobe do not reveal speciﬁcs of the Android OS,
but only report about a Linux system. Second, this ap-
proach bears the advantage of fully compatible results across
platforms, as we use the identical honeypot tools for both,
the mobile and the ﬁxed Internet domain.
2.2 Measurement Setup
We deploy a low-interaction server honeypot based on the
standard tools Honeytrap and Dionaea, because we are in-
terested in the statistical analysis of attacks and not in dedi-
cated threats. This mainly concentrates on attacks from the
’background noise’, but even more intricated threats require
the establishment of a connection to the target.
The honeypot runs at four Linux hosts, each connected
via a diﬀerent network access type: One UMTS network,
an open university network, a DSL home network, and a
darknet. At each site, the honeypot listens at a single public

3. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
The subsequent results represent measurements from mid
December 2011 to the end of January 2012.
General observations Most of the attacks target at the
(open and stable) university host and the minority at the
darknet node. The DSL and UMTS probes measure on av-
erage 46 bogus requests per hour. Between 93% and 99% of
the attacks use TCP with ports 22, 80, and 222 among the
top-ten. Only 35 IP source addresses have been seen on all
four monitors.
Attacks per AS We map the source IP addresses of the
attackers to their origin autonomous systems (AS) and rank
the ASes by the number of attacks. It is worth noting that
the ranking is conducted separately for each type of network
access. For example, AS 23650 and AS 8402 are ranked ﬁrst
in case of the UMTS and university network, respectively.
In general, most of the attacks have been initiated from
the same small set of ASes (cf., Fig. 1(a)). The top-5 ASes
mainly originate from China and Russia over all providers.
It is clearly visible that these few ASes have a more pro-
nounced impact on the mobile regime. In general, the dis-
tributions of attacks among ASes is of similar shape for the
darknet and the home network, while the university encoun-
ters an enhanced and widened distribution of attacks.
In
contrast, attack statistics from the mobile network are sig-
niﬁcantly narrowed.
Attackers per AS We further quantify the number of dif-
ferent source IP addresses per AS to evaluate the number of
distinct adversaries (cf., Fig. 1(b)). The AS ranking is con-
ducted, again, separately. This measure balances individual
intensities of attackers and consequently reduces the maxi-
mum values by some orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, the
characteristic shape of the curves of Fig. 1(a) becomes even
more signiﬁcant. Attacks on the UMTS network remain sig-
niﬁcantly more concentrated to speciﬁc ASes than those of
the ﬁxed networks.
4. DISCUSSION
This paper presented ﬁrst ideas towards a better under-
standing of the nature of mobile-speciﬁc attacks. Our pre-
liminary results for an UMTS-connected device show that
on the overall oﬀenders show an intensity similar to home
networks, whereas regions and originators of attacks are bet-
ter pronounced and operate at higher intensity. This could
be an indication of speciﬁc topological regimes that start to
focus on mobile attacks.
We admit that any IP-level analysis is biased due to the
problem of spoofed source addresses. However, identifying
the spooﬁng of active networks at the end system is fuzzy,
as well. Estimating the error is part of our future work. On
the other hand, most of the addresses belong to the same
IP range/origin AS (cf., also [2]) and thus do not aﬀect our
observations. In the future, we plan to perform more subtle
correlation analysis of how speciﬁc groups of attackers be-
have with the aim to identify individual patterns of mobility-
related aggressions. We will also analyse attacks per port in
more detail. Due to limited statistics, though, these consid-
erations will require a much longer range of observation.
