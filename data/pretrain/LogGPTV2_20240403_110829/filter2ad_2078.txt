## Abstract
Computer systems are frequently targeted by malicious transport contacts. This study analyzes the extent to which these attacks depend on the network access type, specifically focusing on whether adversaries target mobile or non-mobile devices. Using a mobile honeypot, we extract initial statistical results, which indicate that certain topological domains of the Internet have begun to focus more on attacking mobile networks.

## 1. Introduction
Common attacks on Internet devices often start with a connection to a random or specific TCP/UDP port. Adversaries may attempt denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or try to exploit system vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access. The effectiveness of such attacks increases when the attacker targets a specific vulnerability.

Mobile phones are particularly vulnerable to attacks due to their limited hardware resources, which can be easily overwhelmed by DoS disruptions. Additionally, the local system protection in mobile devices is generally less robust compared to notebooks or PCs. However, it remains unclear whether typical adversaries conduct context-specific port scans for intrusions.

In this paper, we present a mobile honeypot that collects external requests to an end device connected via a mobile operator. We compare the data collected over more than one month with logs from four probes connected to different (non-mobile) ISPs. Our analysis reveals that a mobile device, on average, experiences the same number of attacks as a home network device. However, the distribution of attacks across autonomous systems (ASes) and the number of attackers from the same ASes are significantly more pronounced, suggesting that certain Internet regions specialize in attacking mobile devices.

Current studies have focused on identifying attacker-friendly ASes or the network-level behavior of spammers but have not differentiated between mobile and stationary access. Research on mobile honeypots has primarily dealt with secure implementation on smartphones, and to our knowledge, no prior work has analyzed attacks based on a mobile honeypot.

## 2. Mobile Honeypot

### 2.1 Background & Design
A honeypot is a trap designed to collect data from unauthorized system access, typically via IP, initiated by remote parties. Its purpose is to gather information about the nature and characteristics of attacks. The term "mobile honeypot" is not yet well-defined, but it generally refers to a probe that:
- Resides on a mobile device,
- Runs on a mobile operating system, or
- Operates within the network of mobile devices.

We argue that remote attacks are primarily bound to the network layer and do not focus on the specifics of mobile hardware but rather target the system level.

For our mobile honeypot, we use a Linux-based system connected to a mobile operator network for two reasons:
1. A significant portion of current smartphones run Android, making it an appropriate platform for observations. However, current OS fingerprinting tools like Nmap or Xprobe do not reveal specifics of the Android OS but only report it as a Linux system.
2. This approach ensures fully compatible results across platforms, as we use identical honeypot tools for both mobile and fixed Internet domains.

### 2.2 Measurement Setup
We deploy a low-interaction server honeypot using standard tools Honeytrap and Dionaea. Our primary interest is in the statistical analysis of attacks, not in detailed threat assessment. This setup mainly captures attacks from "background noise," but even more sophisticated threats require establishing a connection to the target.

The honeypot runs on four Linux hosts, each connected via a different network access type:
- One UMTS network,
- An open university network,
- A DSL home network, and
- A darknet.

At each site, the honeypot listens on a single public IP address. Every external IP connection is considered an attack, and the source IP address is termed the attacker.

## 3. Preliminary Results
The following results are based on measurements from mid-December 2011 to the end of January 2012.

### General Observations
- Most attacks target the open and stable university host, with the fewest targeting the darknet node.
- The DSL and UMTS probes measure an average of 46 bogus requests per hour.
- Between 93% and 99% of the attacks use TCP, with ports 22, 80, and 222 among the top ten.
- Only 35 IP source addresses were observed across all four monitors.

### Attacks per Autonomous System (AS)
We map the source IP addresses of the attackers to their origin ASes and rank the ASes by the number of attacks. The ranking is conducted separately for each type of network access. For example, AS 23650 and AS 8402 are ranked first for the UMTS and university networks, respectively.

Overall, most attacks originate from a small set of ASes (Figure 1(a)). The top-5 ASes are primarily from China and Russia across all providers. These few ASes have a more pronounced impact on the mobile regime. The distributions of attacks among ASes are similar for the darknet and home network, while the university encounters a broader distribution. In contrast, attack statistics from the mobile network are significantly more concentrated.

### Attackers per AS
We further quantify the number of different source IP addresses per AS to evaluate the number of distinct adversaries (Figure 1(b)). The AS ranking is conducted separately again. This measure balances individual attack intensities and reduces the maximum values by several orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, the characteristic shape of the curves in Figure 1(a) becomes even more pronounced. Attacks on the UMTS network remain significantly more concentrated to specific ASes than those on fixed networks.

## 4. Discussion
This paper presents initial insights into the nature of mobile-specific attacks. Our preliminary results for a UMTS-connected device show that, overall, the intensity of attacks is similar to that of home networks. However, the regions and origins of attacks are more pronounced and operate at higher intensity, suggesting that specific topological regimes are beginning to focus on mobile attacks.

We acknowledge that any IP-level analysis is subject to bias due to the problem of spoofed source addresses. Identifying spoofing at the end system is challenging, and estimating the error is part of our future work. However, most of the addresses belong to the same IP range/origin AS and thus do not significantly affect our observations. Future work will include more detailed correlation analysis to identify individual patterns of mobility-related aggressions and a more in-depth analysis of attacks per port. Due to limited statistics, these considerations will require a longer observation period.
