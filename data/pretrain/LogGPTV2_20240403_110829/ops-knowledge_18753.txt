Question: In reviewing the source code for a mobile application, you come across the following snippet of code used for encrypting user data:

java
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance('DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding');


As a security consultant, what recommendation would you provide regarding the use of this encryption method?
"A": "Retain the use of DES/ECB as it is a certified and widely used encryption standard that provides strong security.",
"B": "Suggest replacing DES/ECB with a more secure alternative like AES-GCM-256 due to known vulnerabilities in DES and ECB mode.",
"C": "Advise to continue using DES/ECB but increase the key length to improve its security stance.",
"D": "Recommend the implementation of RC4 instead of DES/ECB to ensure faster encryption operations and backward compatibility."
Answer: B
