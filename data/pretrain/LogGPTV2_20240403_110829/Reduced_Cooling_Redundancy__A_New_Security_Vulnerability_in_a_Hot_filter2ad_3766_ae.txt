their
thermal impacts. Such a mechanism can effectively mitigate
the negative impacts of a local hotspot, allowing further actions
like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling to be taken inside
the local hotspot for temperature reduction.
We implement a simple prototype of the proposed thermal-
aware load balancing mechanism and conduct one experiment
to demonstrate its effectiveness. In our prototype, we maintain
a list of spots that have large air recirculation effects, especially
under thermal attacks, due to their physical locations. The
VMs of these spots are less likely to be allocated to users.
The conﬁguration of the targeted data center is the same as
Section V. The initial system utilization is 25%.
In our experiment, we conduct a thermal attack using
thermal-intensive workloads that consume 20% more power
consumption than regular workloads. The attacker gradually
increases the number of servers under attack. We ﬁx the supply
air temperature as 16◦C. We measure the inlet temperature
of the local hotspot that has the highest temperature under
different number of attack servers. The result is illustrated
in Figure 18,
in which the “+” line indicates the results
using thermal-aware load balancing and the “x” line represents
the results under the original utilization-based load balancing
policy. Whereas the cooling system cannot keep the hotspot
below the redline threshold using the original policy, our
simple thermal-aware load balancing is able to lower the
temperature by more than 1◦C and keep the hotspot safe under
the thermal attack.
Overall, the proposed thermal-aware load balancing is sim-
ple and straightforward to implement, and it can signiﬁcantly
improve the robustness of a data center against thermal attacks.
However, in an oversubscribed data center, such a reactive
thermal management will still fail to handle much more severe

intensive workloads simultaneously. In our future work, we
plan to pursue more advanced proactive defense strategies to
detect the occurrence of thermal anomalies in real-time and
prevent potential hotspots from overheating themselves and
surrounding servers. The more effective defense systems are
expected to have the following capabilities: (1) robust anomaly
detection with an emphasis on thermal-intensive workloads at
chip and server levels; (2) cost-effective sensing solutions to
proﬁle the thermal dynamics by deploying sensors with the
consideration of costs, networking trafﬁcs, locations and sense
ranges of those additional sensors; and (3) proactive thermal
management on rack and data center levels by exploiting
energy storage such as phase change materials [46].
VII. RELATED WORK
Thermal/power threats. There are some previous works
focus on thermal attacks on individual components of ma-
chines. Kong et al. [32] studied thermal attacks on instruction
caches. They run malicious code to heat other places such
as the back end of the cache, instead of those traditional
hotspots, and thus avoid the temperature regulation by the
dynamic thermal management (DTM). A heating attack on
ﬂash memory devices is studied in [47]. A memory cell
inside a memory array is locally heated up by an inexpensive
laser-diode module. As a result, the contents of the memory
can be altered and compromised. Paul et al. [41] launched
a thermal attack on disk storages. They used intensive hot
seeks that maximize the power consumption of the disk arm
to rapidly and repeatedly increase the temperature. The disk
is throttled due to DTM. Hasan et al. [26] conducted a
heat based attack on Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) by
repeatedly accessing a shared source to create a hotspot in
one malicious thread. Thermal covert channel attacks based on
CPU cores’ temperature variations have been presented in [39],
[16]. While these works provide a guidance on thermal attacks
on individual components, they do not study the impacts of
thermal attacks on servers and data centers.
Wu et al. [51] conducted energy attacks on servers. They
manipulated malicious requests that can cause a large number
of cache misses and achieved up to 42.3% power consumption
increment. Xu et al. [53] demonstrated the vulnerability of
cloud services to power attack due to power oversubscription
at data centers. An attacker can force victim servers to reach
their power peaks at the same time and then trip the circuit
breaker. Islam et al. [28] further proposed using a hot air
recirculation based thermal side channel to infer the power
usage of benign users and then launch power attacks when the
aggregated power consumption of benign users is high. Even
battery-backed data centers are vulnerable to such attacks [33].
Power attack [24] differs from thermal attack in that power
attack attempts to generate a power spike within a very short
period and cause a power outage. In comparison with power
attack, thermal attack is more stealthy but its damage could be
as serious as that of power attack. The overheat induced by
thermal attack leads to hardware failure and even shutdown
for self-protection.
Cooling in data center. Different cooling strategies in data
centers have been proposed in the past [25], [27], [35], [40],
[38]. Currently a popular trend is leveraging CFD to simulate
the air recirculation in computing rooms [34]. The introduction
of CFD helps a data center to place CRAC and servers in
an efﬁcient way and thus saves cooling cost. However, those
cooling strategies only focus on the optimization of the cooling
power in data centers, without considering the risk of a thermal
attack.
Impacts of
temperature on servers. The impact of
temperature on servers has been investigated for years. El-
Sayed et al. [19] collected a large amount of ﬁeld data from
different data centers to study the impact of temperature on
hardware reliability. They found that
temperature variation
exhibits strong correlation to hardware failures and server
outages. Sankar et al. [45] also used a large collection of data
to study the correlation between temperature and hard disk
failures. They reported that temperature is strongly correlated
with disk failures. Coskun et al. [18] studied the reliability
of different job scheduling and power management methods.
They proposed a ﬁne grained technique to simulate the thermal
behaviors and input the thermal trace to the reliability model.
PGCapping [37] integrates various techniques to optimize the
multiprocessor performance within a power cap.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have presented a new security threat called
thermal attack on data centers. We ﬁrst conduct a real server
measurement study to systematically investigate the impacts
of different factors on thermal conditions of a physical server.
Based on the measurement results, we propose effective attack
vectors to mount thermal attacks on both virtualized and non-
virtualized environments. To evaluate the impacts of thermal
attack on a data center, we further simulate rack-level and
datacenter-level thermal attacks under three different attack
scenarios using a real-world data center trace. We present the
damage analysis at both the server and data center levels. Our
evaluation and analysis results demonstrate that thermal attack
can degrade the performance and reliability of victim servers,
cause local hotspots, increase the cooling cost, and even worse
lead to cooling failures, in which some servers are forced to
shut down for overheat protection. Finally, we present a simple
thermal-aware load balancing mechanism to help data centers
defend against thermal attacks, which paves the way for more
sophisticated defenses.
