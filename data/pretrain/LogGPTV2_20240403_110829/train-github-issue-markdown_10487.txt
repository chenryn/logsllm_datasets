Open a TS file and paste this code:
    export type {
      CreateHandle,
      EffectCallback,
      Inputs,
      PropRef,
      Reducer,
      Ref,
      StateUpdater,
    } from "https://esm.sh/PI:EMAIL/hooks";
    export {
      useCallback,
      useContext,
      useDebugValue,
      useEffect,
      useErrorBoundary,
      useImperativeHandle,
      useLayoutEffect,
      useMemo,
      useReducer,
      useRef,
      useState,
    } from "https://esm.sh/PI:EMAIL/hooks";
You will see that type completions and hover are not working. Now remove the
`export type` statement. Type completions and hover work again.
