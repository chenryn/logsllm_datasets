The provided log excerpt, spanning from 2015-08-25 05:00:15 to 2015-08-25 08:33:15, highlights several key issues and events related to the QuorumCnxManager and FastLeaderElection components of a system. Here is a detailed summary:

### Summary of Log Events

1. **Channel Connection Failures:**
   - The QuorumCnxManager component repeatedly fails to open channels to two specific election addresses:
     - `/10.10.34.12:3888` (referred to as "address 2")
     - `/10.10.34.13:3888` (referred to as "address 3")
   - These failures are logged at various times, indicating persistent connectivity issues with these addresses.

2 **Notification Timeouts:**
   - The FastLeaderElection component logs multiple instances of notification timeouts, each with a duration of 60,000 milliseconds (60 seconds).
   - These timeouts suggest that the leader election process is experiencing delays or interruptions.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Initial Warning (05:00:15):**
  - The first warning occurs at 05:00:15, where the QuorumCnxManager cannot open a channel to address 2.
  
- **Subsequent Warnings (05:46:15, 05:50:15, 05:58:15, 06:41:15, 06:58:15, 07:03:15, 07:04:15, 07:16:15, 07:27:15, 08:20:15, 08:21:15, 08:23:15, 08:28:15):**
  - Multiple warnings are logged, indicating repeated failures to open channels to both address 2 and address 3.
  - These warnings are interspersed with varying intervals, suggesting ongoing and intermittent connectivity issues.

- **Notification Timeouts (05:08:15, 05:09:15, 05:58:15, 07:04:15, 08:29:15, 08:33:15):**
  - The FastLeaderElection component logs several instances of notification timeouts, each lasting 60,000 milliseconds.
  - These timeouts indicate that the leader election process is not completing within the expected time frame, possibly due to the connectivity issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion

The log entries reveal a pattern of recurring connection failures and leader election timeouts, which could be indicative of network instability, configuration issues, or other underlying problems. To resolve these issues, it would be advisable to investigate the network connectivity between the nodes, review the configuration settings, and ensure that all nodes are operational and reachable.
