**Host Performance CPU and MEM Overload Evaluation**

We conducted an evaluation of the overhead introduced by BARM (Bus Activity Regular Monitoring) using both memory (MEM) and CPU benchmarks. The tests were performed with one online CPU core (one CPU bus master) and four online CPU cores (two CPU bus masters), as shown in Figures (a) and (b).

Initially, we ran the benchmarks without BARM to establish a baseline. Subsequently, we repeated the benchmarks with BARM, using a sampling interval of 32 milliseconds. The results are presented as the relative overhead.

- **CPU Benchmark:** No significant overhead was observed.
- **MEM Benchmark:** An overhead of approximately 3.5% was detected. The number of active CPU cores or bus masters did not affect the overhead.

Additionally, we tested the impact of different sampling intervals on the overhead, as illustrated in Figures (c) and (d). The findings were consistent:
- **CPU Benchmark:** No overhead was observed.
- **MEM Benchmark:** A longer sampling interval reduced the overhead. This does not compromise BARM's ability to detect DMA attacks but may slightly delay the detection, potentially allowing some damage before the attack is stopped.

**Evaluating BARM with Password Prompts and Runtime Attacks**

BARM monitors for additional bus activity (Aa) every 32 milliseconds. If the measured value exceeds the tolerance threshold (T = 50), BARM detects and stops the attack. When the platform is not under attack, the values remain below T, as shown in Figures (a) and (b) labeled "no DAGGER."

- **Figure (a):** Depicts an attack where DAGGER is waiting for the user password. BARM detects and stops the attack almost immediately with the first measurement.
- **Figure (b):** Shows DAGGER attempting to attack the platform at an arbitrary point during runtime, with similar results.
- **Figure (c):** Displays the kernel log generated by BARM during the attack attempt shown in Figure (b).

**Platform Bus Masters and Sensitive Applications**

Not all platform bus masters are necessary for every sensitive application. For instance, when a user enters a password or other sensitive data, only the UHCI controller and the CPU are required.

We evaluated BARM with password prompts on a Linux system. The test environment included four active bus masters: two CPUs, one UHCI, and one ME bus.
