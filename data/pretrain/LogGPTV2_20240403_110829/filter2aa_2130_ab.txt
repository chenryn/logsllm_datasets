Need a Secure Format?
• The Corporate 1000 Format is a 35-bit card format that is owned
and controlled by the end-user.
• To enhance facility security, HID provides end-users with their
own proprietary protocol.
• Once the Corporate 1000 Format is established, end-users have
the flexibility to choose almost any access control
hardware/software platform or system integrator.
• Whatever system or vendor is chosen, end-users maintain the
ability to use a single access card at any site across the nation or around the world.
• Cards can be customized with a photo ID, custom artwork, magnetic stripe, bar code, or
contact smart chip module.
• HID tracks the card numbers to ensure that no duplication occurs.
• Any HID access control card can be programmed with the assigned format.
HID can meet every customer’s goal of handling multiple applications with just one card!
HID’s Standard Anti-Counterfeiting Offering Includes:
• Ultra-violet (UV) Fluorescent Inks: Invisible to the naked eye, these inks can
verify the authenticity of a card when placed under a black ultra-violet light.
• Holograms: The accepted security measure in the financial and banking
world, holograms are easily recognizable by security personnel, allowing
for quick identification of counterfeit cards.
• Corporate Logo: Enhance corporate identity and brand recognition by
creating a unique hologram or UV fluorescent ink design using your
company’s logo.  Easily identified by security personnel, the exclusive
logo will visibly demonstrate your company’s commitment to
security.
