Question: "A security consultant claims that setting the 'HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity' registry value to 1 on a Windows 10 version 1511 machine will enable memory integrity with UEFI lock by default. As a Windows security expert, which statement best counters this claim?"
 "A": "The 'HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity' value does not control memory integrity; it is related to Credential Guard."
 "B": "Setting 'HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity' to 1 does enable memory integrity, but it does not enforce a UEFI lock by default."
 "C": "The 'HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity' registry value must be set to 3 to enable memory integrity with UEFI lock."
 "D": "On Windows 10 version 1511, the 'HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity' registry setting is not available and therefore cannot be used to enable memory integrity."
Answer: B
