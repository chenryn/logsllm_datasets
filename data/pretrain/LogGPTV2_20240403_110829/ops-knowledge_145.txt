User: I've been using python from time to time for some small projects and just started using it again after quite a while. I'm using Enthoughts Canopy IDE and get the following error:
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xfc' in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)
I know that I have to define the encoding first and I do so in the 2nd Line:
" # -- coding: utf-8 -- "
but when I run the script within Canopy I keep getting the error whenever I enter one of the following letters: ä,ö,ü as user input
When I start my script via console ("python XXX.py" or "ipython XXX.py") it works like a charm .
I'm just a little confused since I thought Canopy uses the ipython interpreter so there shouldn't be any differences whether I start it from console as ipython or via canopy
best regards
Assistant: are you running this code from an unsaved buffer?  If yes, this is a known issue in Canopy 1.0 and should be fixed in the next update.  If no, can you provide a minimal example to reproduce your problem, so this can be fixed?  Thanks!
