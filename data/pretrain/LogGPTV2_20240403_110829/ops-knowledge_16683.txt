User: I've studied Python and Django, building a homepage.
And I've been using a virtual memory on Ubuntu server(apache2 2.4.18/ php-7.0/ MariaDB 10.0.28 with phpMyAdmin/ FTP) offered for developers.
The server hadn't allowed users to use python, but I asked the server administrator to give me a permission and I got it.
The problem was, however, that I was not allowed to use not only any sudo command line but also basic commands like apt-get and python.
The only administrator can do so, therefore it seems that I cannot install any neccessary things-virtualenv, django, and so on- by myself. 
Just to check whether .py file works or not, I added <?php include_once"test.py" ?> on the header of index.php about the test.py where only print "python test"(meaning only python 2 is installed on this server) is written. It works. That is, I guess, all I can do is uploading .py file with Filezilla.
In this case, can I make a homepage with Python on this server efficiently? I was thinking about using Bottle Framework, but also not sure. 
I am confused with wondering whether I should use PHP on this server and using Python on PythonAnywhere in the end.
I am a beginner. Any advice will be appreciated :)
Assistant: Have you thought about asking the admin to start a virtualenv for you and give you permissions to work in that environment?
