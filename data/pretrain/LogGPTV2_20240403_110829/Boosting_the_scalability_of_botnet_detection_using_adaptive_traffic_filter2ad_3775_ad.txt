increases. We conﬁgured Birch to run M axRound = 50
to simulate the process of identifying up to P erExp suspi-
cious hosts. The exponential time increment for C-Plane
clustering of BotMiner indicates its limited scalability. The
cross-epoch correlation shows linear pattern and its linear
regression model is t = 0.0035x.

Figure 8: Avg detection rate (over SRT s) of Cross-
Epoch Correlation using B-Sampling
Figure 8 presents the mean and standard deviation for de-
tection rates by Flow-Correlation with B-Sampling for dif-
ferent M , given P erExp (5% or 10%) for all SRT . First,
the results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of cross-epoch cor-
relation. When no cross-epoch correlation is used (M = 1),
many legitimate IPs show stronger similarity than bots in a
single epoch. Therefore, given a certain P erExp, more than
50% bots are missed. While cross-epoch correlation can
eﬀectively eliminate these legitimate IPs that show strong
similarity in one epoch but do not have persistently similar
patterns. For example, cross-epoch correlation with M = 2
can successfully detect most bots. Second, the results indi-
cate that cross-epoch correlation is not sensitive to the value
of M . For example, for M = 3/4/5, the cross-epoch corre-
lation achieves similar detection rate. Such observation also
indicates that N
6.4 Botnet Detection
2 is a good value for M .
Fine-grained botnet detector inspects all the packets re-
lated to suspicious IPs detected by Flow-Correlation. Using
1.5hr trace mixed with botnet traces, we evaluated the de-
tection rate and performance of the ﬁne-grained detector.
By analyzing the similarity among IRC messages, “IRC
Message Correlation” component in our detector detected
bots in Bot-IRC-A/B. Other bots were detected by the “Cor-
relation” component. For example, Bots in Bot-HTTP-B/C
trigger alerts when they scan the local network. Bot-HTTP-
A bots trigger alerts when they make update requests. Storm
and Waledac trigger alerts when they discover peers. These
bots were detected by correlating such activities/alerts with
corresponding pairs of IPs from Flow-Correlation. Table 5
presents the detection rates and false positive rates for the
ﬁne-grained detector for diﬀerent SRT s and P erExps. The
corresponding cells in Table 11 in Appendix A present the
percentage of packets that our ﬁne-grained detector needs
to inspect. For most combinations of SRT and P erExp,
our framework can reduce traﬃc volume by more than 90%
for ﬁne-grained detector but still keep high detection rates
and low false positives. For example, for SRT = 0.01 and
P erExp = 0.05, the ﬁne-grained detector can detect all bots
with false positive of 0, and it only needs to focus on 1.7%
percentage of packets.
