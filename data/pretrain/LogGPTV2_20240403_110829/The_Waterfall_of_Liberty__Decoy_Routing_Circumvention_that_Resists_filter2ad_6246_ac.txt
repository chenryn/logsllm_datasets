ring AS does not necessarily switch all downstream decoyed traffic
to decoy-free routes depending on the placement of decoy routers,
e.g., for overt destinations close to decoy ASes.
4.2.1 Analysis. We consider two types of rewiring attacks. In
the first type, rewiring-I, a censoring ISP disconnects herself from
some of its provider (ring) ASes without connecting to new AS
providers. This will re-route traffic that the censoring AS received
from its disconnected provider ASes to its other provider ASes. In
the second type of the attack, rewiring-II, the censoring AS can even
switch its re-routed traffic through other censoring ASes under the
control of the censor (i.e., connect to new transit ASes).
Table 2 compares the impact of the rewiring attack on downstream-
only decoy routing with the impact of the RAD attack on previous
upstream decoy routing systems (China is the censoring adversary).
As can be seen, for the same number of decoy routing ASes, the
impact of the rewiring attack is significantly larger than RAD. For
instance, with 50 ASes deploying decoy routing, the RAD attack will
impact only 18.2% of the traffic of Chinese users (with 5.6% becoming
unreachable and 12.6% re-routed), however, with the same number
of decoys the rewiring attack will impact 93% of China’s routes, i.e.,
22.4% of routes become unreachable, and 70% get re-routed in the
case of rewiring-I attack.
We also perform similar analysis for Syria to show the impact of
the attack on a less-connected censoring country. As Table 3 shows,
similar to China the rewiring attack imposes a significantly larger
damage to the Syrian censors than RAD. For instance, with only
1 decoy router, the rewiring attack will impact 80% of the routes as
opposed to only 1.5% routes in the case of RAD.
Importance of the costs As can be seen from our analysis, the
rewiring attack has two types of consequences on the censors. First,
it makes a large fraction of Internet destinations unreachable to the
censors. Second, it enforces a large fraction of Internet routes to
get re-routed to other Internet paths. Both of these are extremely
unfavorable to the censors since they will impose significant mon-
etary costs as well collateral damage to the censors, as shown in
previous studies [22, 41, 48]. Particularly, Houmansadr et al. [22]

state espionage and business competition, however, no nation-state
is openly known to be performing them at large scale. Second,
even if such poisoning attacks are implemented at large scale by a
nation-state like China, Internet ASes can defeat it trivially as such
attacks are easy to detect [7, 53, 60]. For instance, if a censoring ISP
is known to hijack prefixes it does not own, other Internet ASes
can implement additional inspection on the BGP messages from
that ISP. Particularly, they can easily ignore any BGP advertisement
that contains a loop to that censoring ISP [27] (i.e., a ASC-ASD-
ASC route). Note that it is in the best interest of all Internet ASes
to detect and defeat such BGP poisoning attacks; continuous, large-
scale BGP poisoning attacks severely harm the business interests
of Internet ASes, e.g., by causing them to lose transit traffic routes
due to poisoning attack, or by degrading the QoS of Internet traffic
due to longer, less-stable routes. Some ASes (e.g., Cogent [27]) are
already implementing mechanisms to defeat such attacks, e.g., by
rejecting BGP advertisements from customer ASes if the advertised
path contains one of their network peers or providers. Finally,
note that unlike RAD and its alternatives presented in this paper,
the BGP poisoning attacks are not inherent to decoy routing, but
instead are due to weaknesses in the BGP protocol. Therefore, they
may not apply to future, more-secure alternatives of the BGP like
BGPSEC [34].
5 WATERFALL: THE FIRST
DOWNSTREAM-ONLY DECOY DESIGN
As we demonstrated above in Section 4, the downstream-only de-
coy routing architecture offers a significantly stronger resistance
to routing attacks compared to traditional decoy routing. This is
enabled by running decoy routers only on the downstream traf-
fic of the censored users, with no need to intercept the upstream
traffic of the censored users. This, however, makes the design of
downstream-only decoy routing systems significantly more chal-
lenging than traditional decoy routing systems. Particularly, all
previous (upstream) decoy routing designs [4, 15, 21, 25, 58, 59] use
the upstream traffic of the censored users for upstream covert com-
munications, i.e., to communicate essential covert messages to the
decoy routers, such as registration requests, HTTP GET requests for
blocked destinations, etc. This is not possible in a downstream-only
decoy routing system since the upstream traffic of the censored
user is not supposed to be intercepted by the decoy routers.
In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of downstream-only
decoy routing by designing the first downstream-only decoy rout-
ing system, which we call Waterfall. We use a set of complementary
mechanisms to enable low-latency upstream covert communica-
tions in Waterfall despite its downstream-only architecture. Par-
ticularly, we use various HTTP redirection techniques to enable
real-time upstream covert communications in Waterfall. We also
use various techniques to make Waterfall resistant to traffic analysis
attacks, as discussed in Section 9. We have built a fully functional
prototype of Waterfall, which is available online [55].
5.1 Waterfall’s Main Entities
The following are the key players in Waterfall, which is similar to
any other decoy routing system.

only decoy routing with RAD on previous designs.
have shown that the traffic re-routed by the censors is significantly
more expensive and offer lower quality compared to the default
(best) BGP routes, as also listed in Section 2.4.
4.3 BGP Poisoning Attacks
It is possible for a censoring ISP to use BGP poisoning attacks
to modify the downstream routes of its users in order to avoid
certain decoy ASes. One class of such attacks is the well-known
BGP hijacking attack [3, 7] in which an adversary takes over the
traffic to a victim AS by advertising fake shorter BGP routes or
more-specific BGP routes for that AS. If a censoring ISP succeeds
in BGP hijacking a decoy AS, she will be able to prevent censored
decoy routing users (also non-decoy users) from reaching that AS
for decoy routing. There are other known BGP poisoning attacks
that may be leveraged by a censoring ISP. For instance, previous
work [27] shows how carefully crafted BGP messages can route
traffic away from a certain AS for the purpose of fast connectivity-
failure recovery. Such tricks can be used by the censors to steer
traffic away from decoy ASes. Consider a censoring ISP ASC and a
decoy AS ASD. The censoring ISP can advertise the poisoning route
ASC-ASD-ASC to its neighbors. The neighbor ASes of ASD will
not advertise this route to ASD if they have loop avoidance check
enabled. In that case, ASD will not know any paths to ASC, and
therefore, any traffic towards ASC that would normally go through
ASD will then be re-routed through alternative routes (if there are
any) or get dropped.
Note that such attacks are not specific to the decoy routing
systems presented in this paper (downstream-only), but rather are
relevant to any decoy routing system. Similar to previous studies,
we do not consider such attacks in our threat model for the following
reasons. First, to defeat decoy routing, a nation-state will need to
deploy such BGP poisoning attacks continuously and at large scale.
A rational nation-state is unlikely to do so due to the significant

Clients: A Waterfall client is a censored Internet user who installs
Waterfall’s circumvention software to bypass censorship.
Censor: A censor is a nation-state who regulates, monitors, and
restricts the Internet access of its Internet users. A censoring ISP
is an ISP under the jurisdiction of a censor, therefore one that
implements the censorship mechanisms instructed by the censor.
Overt (Non-Blocked) Destinations: Internet destinations (e.g., web-
pages) that are not forbidden by the censor. Similar to other decoy
routing systems, Waterfall’s client software connects to some arbi-
trary overt destinations in order to bypass censorship.
Internet destinations that are for-
Covert (Blocked) Destinations:
bidden by the censor, and therefore are not directly accessible by
censored users. Censored users use Waterfall’s client software to
covertly communicate with blocked destinations.
Decoy AS: A friendly autonomous system (AS) who cooperates
with Waterfall by mounting Waterfall’s decoy routing software
on its border routers, i.e., decoy routers. Previous work [41] has
discussed the incentives of Internet ASes on becoming decoy ASes.
5.2 Overview of Waterfall’s Operation
Figure 1c illustrates the main architecture of Waterfall. Here, we
introduce the main phases of Waterfall’s operation, which will be
thoroughly discussed in the following sections.
Registration Phase To use Waterfall, a censored client first needs
to register with the Waterfall system. During the registration, the
client provides Waterfall with information required for the opera-
tion of Waterfall. Particularly, such information enables Waterfall
decoys to authenticate the registered censored client, and to be able
to man-in-the-middle the registered client’s TLS traffic (with the
client’s consent). We will describe this phase in Section 6.
Circumvention Phase After the client has registered with Wa-
terfall, she can use Waterfall to bypass censorship and connect to
blocked Internet destinations, which is done in the following steps:
