Abstract—Open DNS resolvers are resolvers that perform
recursive resolution on behalf of any user. They can be exploited
by adversaries because they are open to the public and require
no authorization to use. Therefore, it is important to understand
the state of open resolvers to gauge their potentially negative
impact on the security and stability of the Internet. In this
study, we conducted a comprehensive probing over the entire
IPv4 address space and found that more than 3 million open
resolvers still exist in the wild. Moreover, we found that many
of them work in a way that deviates from the standard. More
importantly, we found that many open resolvers answer queries
with the incorrect, even malicious, responses. Contrasting to
results obtained in 2013, we found that while the number of open
resolvers has decreased signiﬁcantly, the number of resolvers
providing incorrect responses is almost the same, while the
number of open resolvers providing malicious responses has
increased, highlighting the prevalence of their threat.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical dis-
tributed naming system and is a pillar of today’s Internet. The
primary goal of DNS is to supply a mapping between domain
names and associated IP addresses. For instance, once a user
types a domain name, e.g., www.example.com, into a web
browser, the domain name will be mapped, by a set of DNS
servers, to the associated IP address, e.g., 1.2.3.4. Almost all
Internet services depend on DNS to connect users to hosts
by resolving DNS queries. However, because DNS is an open
system, anyone may query publicly accessible resolvers, called
open resolvers. The operation of those resolvers is required in
rare cases; mainly public services such as Google DNS [1]
and Open DNS [2]. However, prior studies identiﬁed millions
of publicly-accessible open resolvers on the Internet [3], [4].
It is shown that open resolvers are an attractive target for
attackers to launch a wide variety of attacks, such as DNS
ampliﬁcation [5], DNS manipulation [6], etc.
Open resolvers can be used as a stepping stone for many
attacks. For example, a report by CloudFlare highlights a
75Gbps DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS attack in 2013 [7] using
open resolvers in the wild. Takano et al. [8] also show the
potential of DNS open resolvers for attacks by investigating
the software version installed on those resolvers. Moreover,
several previous studies demonstrated that DNS manipulation
is widely used for malicious purpose by adversaries [9], [10],
censorship by governments [11], or even monetary bene-

ﬁts [12]. These works showed that open resolvers in the wild
expose their vulnerabilities to the adversaries and users alike.
To this end, we present in this work an up-to-date view of
open resolvers’ threats through an in-depth analysis. Unlike the
prior work that only dealt with a small subset of accessible
open resolvers [11], [13], [6], [14], we attempt to investigate
all open resolvers over the Internet. Moreover, we focus on the
behavioral aspects of open resolvers, which provides a deeper
understanding of threats posed by them. Mutual reliability is
the most important factor in DNS, where domain name is
queried and a response is obtained. This reliability can be
guaranteed only when a role-based behavior is performed.
Observing the behavior of open resolvers is a measure of their
security and DNS reliability as a whole.
Contribution. Our main contributions are as follows:
• We conducted a comprehensive measurement over the
entire IPv4 address space to understand the behaviors
and threats of open resolvers around the world. An
Internet-wide measurement allows us to have an empirical
understanding of DNS open resolvers independent of
arbitrary generalization. We found that there are about
3 million recursive resolvers that do not require any
authorization for domain name resolution.
• Through quantitative analysis, we found that many open
resolvers generate DNS responses in a way that deviates
from the standard. More speciﬁcally, the responses from
open resolvers marked ﬁelds in DNS response header,
such as the Recursion Available bit, the Authoritative
Answer bit, and the response code, improperly.
• Through measurements, we report empirical results of
DNS manipulation by open resolvers. By validating the
open resolvers’ answers, we discovered that more than
26 thousand open resolvers redirect users to malicious
destinations reported as malware, phishing, etc.
• For a temporal contrast, we use a dataset collected in
2013. We found that the number of open resolvers has
signiﬁcantly decreased, while the number of resolvers
manipulating responses remains the same, and the number
of open resolvers providing malicious responses has
rather increased. This result shows the prevalence of open
resolvers as a threat, despite their decrease in number.
While our work is the ﬁrst academic work that
looks
into surveying open resolvers and their behavior, it is not
the ﬁrst operational system. For example, the open resolver

project (openresolverproject.org) is the ﬁrst to survey open
resolvers on the Internet. However, the project falls short in
two aspects. First, it does not provide any behavioral analysis
of those open resolvers. Second, it is discontinued since 2017,
supposedly because of the matureness of the space and the
reduced number of open resolvers. In this work, we show
through behavioral analysis that the threat of open resolvers is
persistent as evidenced by the increasing number of malicious
open resolvers, despite the overall decrease of open resolvers.
Organization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
In section II, we provide an overview of DNS functionality
and resolution, as well as an outline of open resolvers threat.
In section III we describe the methodology, followed by
measurement results in section IV. In section V, we present
various discussion points. In section VI, we review the related
works, and draw concluding remarks in section VII.
II. PRELIMINARIES
This section provides a brief overview of DNS operation
and the sequential process of domain name resolution.
A. DNS Functionality
When a user wants to access a website on the Internet, she
can do that by typing the domain name corresponding to the
website, such as www.example.com, into a web browser’s
address bar. However, computers do not communicate using
domains in a string form directly, but using numerically
formed addresses, e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) address. Users,
on the other hand, cannot memorize numerical addresses
easily. To address this issue, Mockapetris [15] introduced the
basics of DNS, which enables users to easily type natural
language strings instead of numeric addresses for websites.
In DNS operation, a human-readable domain name is mapped
into a machine-readable address, e.g., IPv4 or IPv6 address.
Due to its convenience, scalability, and resilience, DNS has
become an essential component of the Internet. Many users
access websites with the help of DNS without being aware
of it. Such characteristics mean that DNS components with
malicious intent can be a signiﬁcant threat. A well-formed
DNS infrastructure can be used for malicious purposes, such
as creating a command & control channel of malware that
uses Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) [16]. Moreover, a
miscreant may pose as an open DNS resolver and participate
in the resolution process. To clarify why it can be a threat, we
brieﬂy describe the operation of DNS in the following.
B. DNS Resolution
For efﬁcient and stable operation, DNS was designed as a
hierarchical and globally distributed system that consists of the
root, Top-level Domain (TLD), and authoritative name servers.
Each of these servers is partly involved in converting human-
memorable domain names to machine-recognizable addresses.
The overall resolution process is shown in Fig. 1. DNS
resolution begins once a user attempts to access a web service
using its domain name. DNS uses cache for performance, and
when a domain name mapping is not cached in the local cache

or the host table, the local resolver initiates a DNS query to
the recursive resolver to retrieve the corresponding IP address
to the domain name. The recursive resolver starts by asking
root, then TLD, then the authoritative name servers.
2(cid:2) through 7(cid:2) show the typical resolution process.
The root server is the ﬁrst server that receives a query from
the recursive resolver, in step 2(cid:2). The root servers are globally
distributed and they maintain the IP addresses and location of
TLD name servers. In step 3(cid:2), the root name server replies to
the query with the appropriate list of TLD servers for .com.
In step 4(cid:2) and 5(cid:2), the recursive server sends a query for
example.com and the .com TLD server responds with the IP
address of the given domain’s authoritative name server. In
step 6(cid:2) and 7(cid:2), the recursive resolver communicates with the
authoritative name server of example.com to ﬁnd the address
of www.example.com. Finally, the translated IP address of the
requested domain name is forwarded to the local resolver. As
a result, the browser can send a Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) request to the website to retrieve its contents.
C. Threat of Open Resolver
As described earlier, the recursive resolver is responsible for
the recursive translation of domain names into IP addresses
on behalf of clients. Among these recursive resolvers, open
resolver is accessible by anyone on the Internet for resolution.
Due to the role a typical recursive resolver plays in the
resolution process, open resolvers are becoming a major threat
to the security and resilience of the Internet. The rest of this
section are details on how open resolver are exploited; e.g.,
for DNS ampliﬁcation attack and DNS manipulation.
DNS Ampliﬁcation Attack. The DNS ampliﬁcation attack
is a DDoS attack performed by exploiting the large difference
between the size of a typical DNS query and the corresponding
response. Originally, DNS had a packet size limited to 512
bytes. However, due to recent update [17], it is now possible
to have more than 512 bytes in DNS responses.
In addition to the ‘A’ type query, which is commonly used to
request the IP address of a webpage, there are also other types
of DNS queries: ‘MX’ for requesting mail server information,
‘CNAME’ for requesting the canonical name of the server,
etc. Moreover, ‘ANY’ type DNS query requests information
about all domains managed by an authoritative name server
including ‘A’, ‘MX’, and ‘CNAME’. If the authoritative name
server manages a larger number of domains, the larger DNS

response will be replied to the ’ANY’ type query. Moreover,
the standard DNS resolution is unauthenticated, which means
it is possible for an adversary to generate a DNS query with
a spoofed address as a source. Because the DNS response is
returned to the source of the query, IP forgery would mean
that someone who did not issue a given query may receive an
overwhelming number of responses.
DNS ampliﬁcation attacks use the above two features of
open resolvers. ‘ANY’ type DNS queries with a victim’s IP
address as a source are sent to the open resolver, resulting in
a concentration of DNS responses to the victim. An attacker
can simply send hundreds of DNS queries to open resolvers
to exhaust the victim’s bandwidth without having to create a
huge amount of packets for a direct DDoS attack. That is, in
such an attack, the open resolver acts as an attack ampliﬁer.
DNS Manipulation. Another viable threat due to open re-
solvers is DNS manipulation. Users typically trust the results
that an open resolver provides as a result of a recursive
resolution. In other words, the IP address contained in the DNS
response is considered as a correct address of the given domain
name. However, an attacker can exploit an open resolver to
provide a manipulated result to the legitimate users. Instead
of the genuine page the user wants to access, a false DNS
response may mislead the user to a similar phishing page
created by the attacker to distribute malicious program or to
steal one’s credential. Even when the attacker does not own
the open resolver, he may produce the same effect by injecting
the manipulated record into other existing open resolvers.

The goal of this work is to answer the following questions.
1) How many open resolvers exist over the world? 2) Do
open resolvers behave correctly? 3) How do such behaviors
pose a threat to Internet users? To answer these questions,
we analyzed DNS responses obtained using an open resolver
probing system, which we describe in the following.
