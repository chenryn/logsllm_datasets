### Title: Practically-Exploitable Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Matrix

We have identified several practically-exploitable cryptographic vulnerabilities in the Matrix standard, which is designed for federated real-time communication. These vulnerabilities also affect Element, the flagship client and prototype implementation of Matrix. Collectively, these issues undermine the confidentiality and authentication guarantees claimed by Matrix against a malicious server. This is particularly concerning given that Matrix's cryptographic routines are built from well-known and well-studied cryptographic components.

One of our attacks demonstrates a full authentication and confidentiality breach by chaining three distinct vulnerabilities. Additionally, the nature of the vulnerabilities we have discovered varies widely, including design flaws, protocol confusion, lack of domain separation, and implementation bugs. These vulnerabilities are distributed across the various subprotocols and libraries that form the cryptographic core of Matrix.

These findings underscore the necessity for a systematic and formal analysis of the cryptographic elements within the Matrix standard to ensure robust security.
