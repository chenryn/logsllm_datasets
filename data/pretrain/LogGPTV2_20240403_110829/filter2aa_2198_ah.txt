knowingly devised andintendedto devisea scheme to defraudand to obtainmoneyby meansof
materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises.
100.
It was partof the scheme thatthedefendants andothers would mislead copyright
holders intobelieving that their notifications of infringing copiesof copyrighted workswould
result in the removal ofthe file or that access to the file would be disabled, when in fact, at best,
only the link(s) identified by the copyright holder would be disabled.

Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 77 of 90 PageID# 322
101.
The scheme allowed infringing copies ofcopyrighted works to remain on the
servers controlled bythe MegaConspiracy andaccessible to members of thepublic(as longas at
least one link remained unknown to the copyright holderprovidingthe notification), and would
further allow newlinks to the infringing copyto becreated (eventhough the infringing copyhad
already been identified as infringing by the copyright holder).
102.
It wasfurther partof the scheme thatthe defendants andothers wouldrepresent to
copyright holders and others that repeat copyright infringers would have their user access
terminated pursuant toterms of service announced bytheMega Conspiracy, when, in fact, repeat
infringers were allowed to continue theirinfringement andat times evenrewarded financially
for it.
103.
It was further partofthescheme that theMega Conspiracy obtained advertising
revenue as a resultof the continuedavailability of filesknownto be infringing when members of
the public were able to view and download them, and provided additional incentive for users to
purchase premium subscriptions dueto continuous access to infringing copies ofcopyrighted
works.
104.
It was further part ofthe scheme to defraud that the defendants and others
misrepresented theMega Conspiracy's Abuse Tool andnotice-and-takedown procedure in
various e-mails to copyright holders and others as follows:
a.
That notification through the Abuse Tool would "remove a batch offiles
from [Mega's] servers;"
b.
That the takedown process enabledthe copyright holdersto "take down
illegal content in real time;"
78
Case 1:12-cr-00003-LO   Document 34    Filed 02/16/12   Page 78 of 90 PageID# 323
c.
That the Mega Conspiracywould be "talcing great care in expeditiously
deleting any material reported to [them] through DMCA takedown
notices;"
d.
That the "takedown tool" would "remove" videos and/or files "from our
system immediately;"
e.
That the Abuse Tool grantedcopyrightholders "direct deletion rights,"
which allowed the rights holders to "take files and films offline
immediately."
f.
That Megavideo was "one ofthe few online video communities that
ma[de] it impossible to fraudulently host full-length feature movies due to
a human-assisted automatic detection/deletion mechanism."
g.
That identifying a URL link to infringing material though the Abuse Tool
would "take down material from Megavideo."
