It appears that you are encountering a `NotConfigured` error, indicating that the `celeryconfig.py` file is not being found. This issue persists even though you have defined the configuration in both `/etc/profile` and your virtual environment's `activate` script.

To resolve this, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **Set the Configuration via Environment Variable:**
   You can specify the path to your `celeryconfig.py` using the `CELERY_CONFIG_MODULE` environment variable. For example:
   ```sh
   export CELERY_CONFIG_MODULE=/path/to/your/celeryconfig
   ```

2. **Use the `--config` Command-Line Option:**
   When starting Celery, you can provide the path to your configuration module using the `--config` option. The path should be relative to the `CELERY_CHDIR` setting (which defaults to the current working directory) or it can be a Python module name, not a filename. For example:
   ```sh
   celery -A myapp worker --config=celeryconfig
   ```

The error message could be more informative by including these two points:
- The path to the `celeryconfig.py` file should be a valid Python module.
- The `--config` option can be used to specify the configuration module.

By ensuring that the `celeryconfig.py` is correctly referenced and accessible, you should be able to resolve the `NotConfigured` error.
