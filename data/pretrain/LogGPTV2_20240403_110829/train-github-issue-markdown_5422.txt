When using the latest version of webpack, I encountered an issue where it is generating invalid JavaScript code. You can find the problematic code snippet [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/binarykitchen/a1899291fc3b470ba83cb9a245317775/raw/60de0910ca0a6bef87d96a202de8faa0ffb785ce/gistfile1.txt).

Chrome reports the following error:
```
index.coffee:2 Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
    at Object../lib/jquery/index.coffee (lib.js:851)
    at __webpack_require__ (lib.js:710)
    at fn (lib.js:95)
    at eval (multi_jquery_goog_ext:1)
    at Object.1 (lib.js:1060)
    at __webpack_require__ (lib.js:710)
    at lib.js:762
    at lib.js:765
```

I attempted to identify the cause by systematically disabling each configuration option, but I was unable to resolve the issue. This error occurs for all three of my entry points in development mode.

Does anyone have any insights into what might be causing this problem?
