User: I'm writing python with PyDev and Eclipse.  It's great, but when my code crashes, it prints my runtime stack to the console in the ugliest of ways.  It just prints out a big list and it's really hard to read.  There's gotta be a way to pretty this up, to make it way easier to read, right?  Can PyDev do it?  Thanks!
For example:
2014-01-08 10:28:04,173 [error] Traceable Error raised during rendering process...  - R:\qa\examples\testcases\testcase1.xml

Assistant: This is unrelated to Eclipse and PyDev. Somewhere in your code, you catch all exceptions and turn them into such ugly lists.
Stop doing that or convert the output into a single multi-line string and the output will look useful again.
Alternatively, you can try to format the list line by line when you log the error.
