ABSTRACT
To enable enhanced accountability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) operations, the US-based Federal Avionics Administration
(FAA) recently published a new dedicated regulation, namely Re-
moteID, requiring UAV operators to broadcast messages reporting
their identity and location. The enforcement of such a rule, manda-
tory by 2022, generated significant concerns on UAV operators,
primarily because of privacy issues derived by the indiscriminate
broadcast of the plain-text identity of the UAV on the wireless
channel.
In this paper, we propose ARID, a solution enabling RemoteID-
compliant Anonymous Remote Identification of UAVs. The adoption
of ARID allows UAVs to broadcast RemoteID-compliant messages
using ephemeral pseudonyms that only a Trusted Authority, such
as the FAA, can link to the long-term identifier of the UAV and its
operator. Moreover, ARID also enforces UAV message authenticity,
to protect UAVs against impersonation and spoofed reporting, while
requiring an overall minimal toll on the battery budget. Further-
more, ARID generates negligible overhead on the Trusted Authority,
not requiring the secure maintenance of any private database.
While the security properties of ARID are thoroughly discussed
and formally verified with ProVerif, we also implemented a proto-
type of ARID on a real UAV, i.e., the 3DR-Solo drone, integrating our
solution within the popular Poky Operating System, on top of the
widespread MAVLink protocol. Our experimental performance eval-
uation shows that the most demanding configuration of ARID takes
only ≈ 11.23 ms to generate a message and requires a mere 4.72 mJ
of energy. Finally, we also released the source code of ARID to foster
further investigations and development by Academia, Industry, and
practitioners.

1 INTRODUCTION
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have
raised significant attention from Academia and Industry over the
last years, thanks to the great benefits they can bring to several ap-
plication domains, such as Transportation, Health, Entertainment,
and the Military, to name a few [36],[28], [48].
Nonetheless, the widespread adoption of UAVs also generated
severe privacy and safety concerns [35], [45],[47]. Indeed, several
Critical Infrastructures (CIs) operators, such as the ones in airports
and military areas, recently reported invasions and unauthorized
accesses by amateur UAV, creating serious security, privacy, and
safety issues [44],[53],[8].
To enable accountability of UAV operations and identify mali-
cious operators, regulatory authorities such as the US-based Federal
Avionic Administrator (FAA) recently introduced a dedicated reg-
ulation, namely Remote Identification (RemoteID) [23], and also
Europe is taking similar actions [16]. In brief, RemoteID forces all
UAVs, including amateur and toy ones, to emit periodic broadcast
messages reporting their identity, location, and information about
the ground station (see Section 3 for further details). RemoteID
regulations became effective on the 21st of April, 2021, and UAV
operators need to comply with this rule from September 2022 [24].
While meeting the requests of CI operators, the RemoteID rule
created significant concerns for the UAV community [4]. In partic-
ular, UAV operators in critical sectors such as retail, transportation,
and health assistance raised issues related to the privacy of their
operations, warning that the RemoteID rule could enable straight-
forward identification of an UAV and its operator, as well as uncon-
trolled leakage of private and sensitive information, such as storage
centres location and customer information [20]. Recently, UAV ama-
teur communities also filed a case to the FAA for the privacy issues
generated by the mandatory adoption of RemoteID [19]. To partially
meet privacy requests by UAV operators, the latest RemoteID rule
provides the possibility to replace the UAV long-term identity with
a Session Identifier, i.e., a pseudonym, hiding the identity of an UAV
while still enabling unique identification from the FAA. However,

the RemoteID rules neither specify how to generate such identifiers,
nor provide guidelines to operators for their design.
Pseudonyms generation and management issues have been in-
vestigated by a few contributions in the last years, especially in
the context of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) [12]. Also,
specific standards are available on the topic, including the ones
published by ETSI [21]. However, as discussed in Section 2, such
solutions either require the support of dedicated infrastructure
elements, such as Internet-connected Road-Side Units (RSUs), or
online Authorities, or they assume the presence of multiple collab-
orating peers. Conversely, commercial amateur UAVs often do not
feature a (persistent) Internet connection, and they operate in an
ad-hoc setup without any chance to interact with other peers. The
cited requirements make previously published schemes unsuitable
for the problem, and call for new domain-specific solutions.
Contribution. In this paper, we propose an Anonymous Remote
IDentification solution (ARID) to tackle the cited challenges. In
particular, ARID is a lightweight and RemoteID-compliant solution
enabling any UAVs to generate RemoteID messages that can be
verified only by legitimate authorities, being otherwise anonymous.
ARID achieves the cited objectives independently from the presence
of a persistent Internet connection and the presence of multiple
collaborating peers, fulfilling all the requirements of amateur UAVs.
Adopting ARID, only a trusted authority (e.g., the FAA) can obtain
the UAV’s long-term identity. At the same time, we also provide
message authentication to protect drones from false reporting, by
allowing the authority to verify (and discard) spoofed messages
that could be generated by malicious parties.
While the security and privacy feature of ARID have been dis-
cussed and formally verified, we also showed the deployability
and ease of adoption of our solution. Indeed, we implemented a
prototype of ARID on a real UAV, i.e., the 3DR-Solo, integrating it
with the open-source Poky OS (a reference distribution of the Yocto
Project) and the Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol. Our
extensive performance evaluation shows that, assuming the highest
level of security, ARID messages can be generated and delivered
with a single broadcast message in only ≈ 11.23 ms, requiring just
4.72 mJ (≈ 1.67 · 10−6% of the UAV battery).
Our prototype implementation, whose source code has been
released [17], leverages popular open-source libraries and tools,
supported by the large variety of commercial UAVs. These features
enhance the impact of ARID, demonstrating its deployability and
ease of adoption, and paving the way for further research in the
field.
Roadmap. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 reviews related work, Section 3 introduces the RemoteID rule,
Section 4 highlights the system and adversary models, Section 5
provides the details of ARID, Section 6 analyzes the security of our
solution, while Section 7 reports the details of the implementation
of the prototype and the performance assessment of ARID. Finally,
Section 8 tightens conclusions and draws future works.
2 RELATED WORK
Only a few previous scientific contributions considered UAVs ano-
nymity, with connection to authentication functionalities and un-
linkability. For instance, the authors in [50] proposed a privacy-
preserving authentication framework for Internet-connected drones,
leveraging the emerging Edge Computing network architecture.
Each drone interacts with an edge node for pseudonym generation,
and the edge node maintains a translation map, allowing to switch
from pseudonyms to real identities. Although being a feasible op-
tion for drones equipped with an Internet connection, the cited
solution is not generalizable also for remote identification of ama-
teur drones, which are likely not Internet-connected. In addition,
such a solution requires assistance from dedicated infrastructure
elements, not available everywhere.
Some contributions investigated anonymity through pseudony-
mity in the context of VANETs. For instance, the authors in [14]
first tackled the problem of pseudonym-based authentication be-
tween two vehicles in a VANET. They proposed a hybrid scheme,
combining locally-generating pseudonyms with group-based signa-
tures, and the secrecy of the identity of a node mainly depends on
the size of the group. However, such a proposal hardly fits with the
scenario of amateur drones, where operators usually fly a drone
without any coordination with other amateurs.
The authors in [42] proposed the adoption of hierarchical privacy-
preserving pseudonyms, to be used in authentication procedures by
a smart car. The initial pseudonym is released by a trusted authority,
maintaining a database of the credentials assigned to the vehicles.
When the vehicle needs to operate in a given area, it interacts with
the local RSU to obtain new area-based pseudonyms that can be
traced back to the original identity. The authors in [41] used a simi-
lar approach but focusing on efficient revocation mechanisms. The
above schemes always require assistance from the infrastructure
(RSU), being not applicable to our problem.
Many papers also investigated privacy-preserving pseudonym
change strategies in VANETs, through mix-zones. Specifically, the
approaches leveraging mix-zones use to change the pseudonym of a
vehicle only when the number of vehicles in the neighbourhood is
significantly high, so to confuse the attacker about new assignments.
For instance, the authors in [11] proposed a scheme leveraging the
RSUs at the road intersections to swap the pseudonyms of two ve-
hicles. The same authors extended this concept in [13] considering
Vehicular Location Privacy Zones (VPLZ), where vehicles access
for service and exit in an order different than the entrance one.
Similarly, the authors in [9] used the concepts of crowd areas and
syntactic obfuscation jointly to confuse the attacker. Similarly, the
authors in [34] proposed to swap pseudonyms in a group in a way
to provide ϵ-differential privacy in the set of features of the vehicles.
However, schemes of this type always require assistance from the
infrastructure.
Despite sharing some features, the research challenges tackled
in this paper are different from anonymous communications in
VANETs. Indeed, privacy-preserving and secure remote identifica-
tion for UAVs implies not broadcasting the long-term identity of the
UAV indiscriminately on the wireless channel, as well as protecting
the UAV from false invasion reports (see Section 4.2). Conversely, in
the case of mutual anonymous authentication in VANETs, a vehicle
receives a specific request from another entity and can decide if
sharing its identity with the requesting vehicle on a case-by-case
basis. Therefore, our scenario and adversary model do not consider
anonymous mutual authentication, which is a different research
problem.

Anonymous identification has also been considered in other
contexts. For instance, in the avionic context, the authors in [6]
proposed a mechanism for securely generating aircraft pseudonyms.
They introduced a dedicated entity, namely the Trusted Registration
Authority (TRA), in charge of assisting vehicles in generating time-
bounded pseudonyms and able to trace back a pseudonym to its
identity. However, their method requires continuous interaction
with the authority for pseudonym generation. In addition, in case
of leakages on the CA, the correspondence between the long-term
identity and the pseudonyms is disclosed.
In the maritime context, the authors in [25] proposed the usage of
a pseudonyms set generated by a trusted authority for each vessel,
used once for every time slot. Such an approach avoids infrastruc-
ture assistance but requires a persistent connection from the vessel
to the authority. The authors in [26] proposed to integrate IEEE
P1609.02 pseudonymous generation and authentication features
within the maritime domain. However, the IEEE P1609.02 standard
mainly refers to unicast transactions, while the Remote Identifica-
tion rule involves broadcast-only communications. Also, note that
approaches such as [54] for secure and anonymous broadcast do
not map to our problem, as they assume a secure communication
channel among a set of parties.
We also highlight that our solution cannot be replaced by a
signcryption protocol [55]. Although signcryption schemes allow
decreasing the computational and communication overhead com-
pared to sign-then-encrypt and hybrid solutions, their anonymous
versions require heavy pairing operations [51], or polynomial in-
terpolation [40], or proxies [31], not feasible on commercial UAVs,
or using ring signatures, requiring a set of trusted parties [39],[15].
Therefore, they cannot be contextualized directly to our problem.
To sum up, the discussion above confirms that anonymous re-
mote identification for UAVs is a different research problem, char-
acterized by specific technology-dependent constraints. Such con-
straints make previous solutions unsuitable for this problem and
call for new domain-specific solutions.
3 FAA REMOTE IDENTIFICATION RULE
With the widespread commercialization of autonomous and remotely-
piloted UAVs, even more news of intentional and unintentional
private-area invasion attacks are appearing. Indeed, UAVs equipped
with a camera can record audio and video of sensitive areas. At the
same time, when operated close to sensitive areas (e.g., airports and
critical infrastructures), also small UAVs typically sold as toys for
children, devoid of cameras and microphones, could cause collisions
and create severe safety risks.
The cited incidents motivated avionics authorities to regulate
the operation of UAVs in several ways. In this context, the US-
based FAA has been the first to announce the publication of a
Remote Identification (RemoteID) regulation, published in its final
version in April, 2021 [23]. The scope of the RemoteID regulation
is to integrate amateur and remotely-piloted drones into the local
National Airspace System (NAS), to provide operators with an easy
way to timely identify the presence of a UAV, its location, and the
