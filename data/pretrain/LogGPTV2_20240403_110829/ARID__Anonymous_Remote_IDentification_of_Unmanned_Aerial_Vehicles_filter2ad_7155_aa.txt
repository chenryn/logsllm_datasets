## Abstract
To enhance the accountability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations, the US-based Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently introduced a new regulation, RemoteID, requiring UAV operators to broadcast messages reporting their identity and location. This rule, which becomes mandatory by 2022, has raised significant privacy concerns among UAV operators due to the indiscriminate broadcast of plain-text identity information over wireless channels.

In this paper, we propose ARID, a solution that enables RemoteID-compliant anonymous remote identification of UAVs. ARID allows UAVs to broadcast RemoteID-compliant messages using ephemeral pseudonyms, which only a Trusted Authority, such as the FAA, can link to the long-term identifier of the UAV and its operator. Additionally, ARID ensures the authenticity of UAV messages, protecting against impersonation and spoofed reporting, while minimizing the impact on the battery budget. Furthermore, ARID imposes negligible overhead on the Trusted Authority, without requiring the secure maintenance of any private database.

The security properties of ARID are thoroughly discussed and formally verified using ProVerif. We also implemented a prototype of ARID on a real UAV, the 3DR-Solo drone, integrating our solution within the popular Poky Operating System and the widely used MAVLink protocol. Our experimental performance evaluation shows that the most demanding configuration of ARID takes only approximately 11.23 ms to generate a message and requires just 4.72 mJ of energy. Finally, we have released the source code of ARID to encourage further research and development by academia, industry, and practitioners.

## 1 Introduction
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained significant attention from academia and industry in recent years due to their potential benefits in various application domains, including transportation, health, entertainment, and military operations [36, 28, 48].

However, the widespread adoption of UAVs has also raised severe privacy and safety concerns [35, 45, 47]. Critical Infrastructure (CI) operators, such as those in airports and military areas, have reported invasions and unauthorized access by amateur UAVs, leading to serious security, privacy, and safety issues [44, 53, 8].

To address these concerns and enable accountability of UAV operations, regulatory authorities like the US-based Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have introduced the Remote Identification (RemoteID) regulation [23]. Similarly, Europe is taking similar actions [16]. The RemoteID regulation, effective from April 21, 2021, mandates all UAVs, including amateur and toy models, to periodically broadcast messages containing their identity, location, and ground station information. Compliance with this rule is required by September 2022 [24].

While the RemoteID rule addresses the concerns of CI operators, it has generated significant concerns within the UAV community [4]. Operators in critical sectors such as retail, transportation, and health assistance have raised privacy issues, warning that the RemoteID rule could lead to the straightforward identification of UAVs and their operators, as well as the uncontrolled leakage of sensitive information, such as storage center locations and customer data [20]. Recently, amateur UAV communities have also filed a case with the FAA over privacy concerns related to the mandatory adoption of RemoteID [19].

To partially address these privacy concerns, the latest RemoteID rule allows the use of Session Identifiers, or pseudonyms, to hide the long-term identity of UAVs while still enabling unique identification by the FAA. However, the rules do not specify how to generate these identifiers or provide guidelines for their design.

## 2 Related Work
Only a few previous scientific contributions have considered UAV anonymity in the context of authentication and unlinkability. For instance, the authors in [50] proposed a privacy-preserving authentication framework for Internet-connected drones, leveraging edge computing. Each drone interacts with an edge node for pseudonym generation, and the edge node maintains a translation map to switch from pseudonyms to real identities. While feasible for drones with an Internet connection, this solution is not generalizable for amateur drones, which are often not Internet-connected. Additionally, it requires dedicated infrastructure elements, which may not be available everywhere.

Some contributions have investigated anonymity through pseudonymity in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). For example, the authors in [14] proposed a hybrid scheme combining locally-generated pseudonyms with group-based signatures. The secrecy of a node's identity depends on the size of the group. However, this proposal is not suitable for amateur drones, where operators typically fly without coordination with others.

The authors in [42] proposed hierarchical privacy-preserving pseudonyms for smart cars, with the initial pseudonym released by a trusted authority. When a vehicle operates in a given area, it interacts with local Road-Side Units (RSUs) to obtain new area-based pseudonyms. The authors in [41] focused on efficient revocation mechanisms. These schemes always require infrastructure support, making them unsuitable for our problem.

Many papers have also explored privacy-preserving pseudonym change strategies in VANETs using mix-zones. These approaches change a vehicle's pseudonym when the number of vehicles in the neighborhood is high, confusing the attacker about new assignments. For example, the authors in [11] proposed a scheme leveraging RSUs at road intersections to swap the pseudonyms of two vehicles. Similar concepts were extended in [13] and [9], but these schemes always require infrastructure assistance.

Despite some shared features, the research challenges in this paper differ from anonymous communications in VANETs. Privacy-preserving and secure remote identification for UAVs involves not broadcasting the long-term identity of the UAV indiscriminately and protecting the UAV from false reports. In contrast, mutual anonymous authentication in VANETs involves a vehicle deciding whether to share its identity with a requesting entity on a case-by-case basis.

Anonymous identification has also been considered in other contexts. For example, in the avionic context, the authors in [6] proposed a mechanism for securely generating aircraft pseudonyms, introducing a Trusted Registration Authority (TRA) to assist in generating time-bounded pseudonyms. However, their method requires continuous interaction with the authority and is vulnerable to leaks.

In the maritime context, the authors in [25] proposed using a set of pseudonyms generated by a trusted authority for each vessel, used once per time slot. This approach avoids infrastructure assistance but requires a persistent connection to the authority. The authors in [26] integrated IEEE P1609.02 pseudonymous generation and authentication features into the maritime domain, but this standard primarily refers to unicast transactions, not broadcast communications.

We also note that our solution cannot be replaced by a signcryption protocol [55]. Although signcryption schemes reduce computational and communication overhead, their anonymous versions require heavy pairing operations [51], polynomial interpolation [40], or proxies [31], which are not feasible on commercial UAVs. Ring signatures, which require a set of trusted parties [39, 15], are also not directly applicable.

In summary, the discussion above confirms that anonymous remote identification for UAVs is a distinct research problem, characterized by specific technology-dependent constraints. These constraints make previous solutions unsuitable and call for new, domain-specific solutions.

## 3 FAA Remote Identification Rule
With the increasing commercialization of autonomous and remotely-piloted UAVs, there have been more reports of intentional and unintentional invasions of private areas. UAVs equipped with cameras can record audio and video of sensitive areas. Even small UAVs, typically sold as toys, can cause collisions and create severe safety risks when operated near sensitive areas like airports and critical infrastructures.

These incidents have motivated avionics authorities to regulate UAV operations. The US-based FAA was the first to announce the publication of the Remote Identification (RemoteID) regulation, finalized in April 2021 [23]. The RemoteID regulation aims to integrate amateur and remotely-piloted drones into the National Airspace System (NAS), providing operators with a means to timely identify the presence, location, and control station of a UAV.
