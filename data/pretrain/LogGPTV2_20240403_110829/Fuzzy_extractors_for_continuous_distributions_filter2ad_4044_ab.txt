helper data, we can write
P (s ∈ Ul|Q ∈ Q) = P (s ∈ Ul) = 2−l.
Introducing the notation P (s, Q) := P (s ∈ S|Q ∈ Q), this gives
= 2−l − inf
s
(P (s, Q)) ≤ 2−l,
with equality when there exists a key sequence that is never attained. If we
compare the two cases, we see that the ﬁrst case represents the value of  if
2−m − 2−l > 2−l, i.e. when m ≤ l − 1.
To conclude, this shows that  can be bounded from above in terms of the
min-entropy m and l as follows:

mean µa, due to the construction is always at the center of the authentic
interval.
The goal of an intruder trying to attack this scheme is to ﬁnd the authentic
interval with a minimal number of trials. We model two types of intruders.
It is assumed that the ﬁrst imposter or the type one imposter knows the dis-
tribution of the population (Sg). The second type intruder called, type II also
knows the parameters L and R.
Type I The intruder knows that the authentic area of a user is far away from
the global mean.
In this case he can safely disregard the segment
where the mean is situated. This leaves a new probability distribution

and R. In Chang et al. [3] these limits are computed as follows:
L = min(µg − kgσg, µa − kaσa)
R = min(µg + kgσg, µa + kaσa)
Here kg and ka are natural numbers chosen by the designers of the system.
For example the author recommends for kg the value 5 so that it covers almost
the entire user distribution.
If the margin L (and the reasoning is the same for R) is somewhere sit-
uated in the right half of a segment we can safely eliminate that segment.
According to the deﬁnition L will always be smaller then µa, which is in the
middle of an interval. Thus the attacker can eliminate all intervals for which
the middle value is smaller then L.
Example In ﬁgure 8 we show how dangerous this combination can be.
Assume the imposter distribution is divided in 4 intervals (cid:104)d1, d2, d3, d4(cid:105).
These intervals are published as helper data. The imposter has to guess which
interval is the authentic one. It is assumed that the imposter distribution is
known to the attacker.
Figure 8: The genuine interval can be guessed from one try.
The attacker can eliminate interval number d3 because it contains the
global mean µg and he knows that a distinguishable feature should be far
away from the global mean.
A type I attacker has 3 candidates for the correct authentic interval. How-
ever, the three intervals have different probabilities associated so the order of
guessing will be: d2, d4, d1. In this case he is lucky from the ﬁrst trial.
A type II attacker also knows the value of L and R. The authentic mean
is situated at the center of the authentic interval. The interval d4 cannot be
the authentic one since its middle value is smaller then L. Thus the attacker
can eliminate d4. The same reasoning holds for R which eliminates d1.

interval, namely d2.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
Fuzzy extractors are a theoretical tool for modelling and comparing template
protection schemes which use a discrete source. We generalize the deﬁnition
to cs-fuzzy extractors, which can also handle the continuous source cases.
Our model can cope with both classes of template protection schemes. Bio-
metric authentication systems are evaluated using the false acceptance rate
and the false rejection rate. The link between the two was hitherto not obvi-
ous even though they refer to the same data.
In this paper we show, for the ﬁrst time that there is a natural connection
between the false acceptance rate, false rejection rate and the parameters used
to evaluate a template protection scheme implemented on the same data.
We also show that the error rates have a direct inﬂuence on the length and
robustness of the key extracted from the features of a user.
In this paper we only consider the one dimensional case. However, bio-
metric data contains multiple features for each user. For generalizing to mul-
tiple independent features, one approach is to analyze each dimension in-
dependently. In this case, the relationship between the min-entropy and the
FAR is as expected: the more dimensions we have, the lower the FAR is
and the number of bits that can be extracted increases. However, the FRR
increases with the number of dimensions that are used. Therefore, this may
not be the best approach for aggregating multiple features. Zhang et al [9]
propose a better approach which can reduce both the FAR and the FRR by
simultaneously analyzing all dimensions.
As future work we want to investigate the inﬂuence of feature aggregation
on the length and robustness of the key.
