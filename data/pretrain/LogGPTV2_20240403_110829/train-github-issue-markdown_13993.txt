Our React app was triggering the following error during navigation events:
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstChild' of undefined`
The error was occurring in the function `findComponentRoot`, when it failed to
find a component for an event callback.
In our app, this was happening when we would navigate during a blur event, and
call `unmountComponentAtNode` on the rendering, in order to refresh the page.
The docs for `unmountComponentAtNode` say
> Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event
> handlers and state
However, this does not seem to be the case. After we refresh the page with
`unmountComponentAtNode`, there were other React-bound callbacks still in
React's queue for that event. Leading to the error.
The docs and intuition seem to imply `unmountComponentAtNode` should clear
these callbacks, since it knows the components will no longer exist to handle
them.
