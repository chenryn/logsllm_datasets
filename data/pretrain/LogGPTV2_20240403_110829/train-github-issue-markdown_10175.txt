Hello,

Today, I created a new React.js project using the TypeScript template with the following command:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-project-name --template typescript
```
The React version in the project is 16.13.1. After setting up the project, I started it using:
```bash
npm start
```
The project ran successfully, and I was able to see the expected result.

However, when I attempted to install a new package, such as `react-router-dom`, I noticed that some packages were being removed from the `node_modules` directory. Now, when I try to run the project, I encounter the following error:
```plaintext
./src/assets/styles/index.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-5-1!./node_modules/postcss-loader/src??postcss!./node_modules/resolve-url-loader??ref--6-oneOf-5-3!./node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-5-4!./src/assets/styles/index.scss)
Error: Package exports for 'C:\projects\sokna-pwa\node_modules\autoprefixer\node_modules\kleur' do not define a valid './colors' target.
```
Interestingly, when I removed the CSS files from `index.tsx` and `App.tsx`, the project compiled successfully. This indicates that the issue is related to the CSS files.

After extensive research, I tried the following command, which temporarily resolved the issue:
```bash
yarn add sass-loader@^7.0.1 node-sass --dev
```
However, the problem reoccurs whenever I attempt to add a new package to the project.

How can I permanently fix this issue?

Thank you for your help.
