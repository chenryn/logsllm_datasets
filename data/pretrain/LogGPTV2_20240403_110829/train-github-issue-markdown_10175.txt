Hi, today I created a new react.js project in **typescript** template using
this command :  
`npx create-react-app my-project-name --template typescript`.  
Then project's react version is: 16.13.1 .
After completing this process, I ran it using this command: `npm start`. It
ran successfully and I saw the result.  
Then when I tried to get install a new package like `react-router-dom`, I saw
some of packages are removing from my project's `node_modules`.
Now when I'm trying to run the project, it will getting an error as below:  
`./src/assets/styles/index.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--
6-oneOf-5-1!./node_modules/postcss-loader/src??postcss!./node_modules/resolve-
url-loader??ref--6-oneOf-5-3!./node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/sass-
loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-5-4!./src/assets/styles/index.scss) Error:
Package exports for 'C:\projects\sokna-
pwa\node_modules\autoprefixer\node_modules\kleur' do not define a valid
'./colors' target`.
But when I removed css files from index.tsx and App.tsx, it compiled
successfully. Then the problem is in the css files.
After too many long searchs, I tries this command from this **#issue** :  
`yarn add sass-loader@^7.0.1 node-sass --dev`
This command will fixes my project for temp but when I getting try to add a
new package to my project, the last error will appears.
How can I fix this ???  
Thank for your help
