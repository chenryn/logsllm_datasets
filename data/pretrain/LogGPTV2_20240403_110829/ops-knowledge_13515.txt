To effectively implement CIS Control 1.2, which addresses unauthorized assets, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Establish a Clear Process**: Develop and document a well-defined process for identifying and addressing unauthorized assets. This process should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure its effectiveness.

2. **Regular Monitoring and Detection**: Implement a system to continuously monitor the network for unauthorized devices. This can include using network access control (NAC) solutions, asset management tools, or other security technologies that can detect and alert on unknown or unapproved devices.

3. **Weekly Review and Action**: Conduct a weekly review of detected unauthorized assets. Based on the findings, take appropriate action, which may include:
   - **Removal from the Network**: Physically or logically disconnect the unauthorized device from the network.
   - **Denial of Remote Access**: Prevent the unauthorized device from connecting to the network remotely.
   - **Quarantine**: Isolate the unauthorized device in a secure environment to prevent it from accessing sensitive data or spreading potential threats.

4. **Communication and Reporting**: Ensure that all relevant stakeholders, including IT, security, and management, are informed about the detection and actions taken. Maintain detailed records of all incidents and actions for future reference and compliance purposes.

5. **Security Function and Asset Type**: Note that CIS Control 1.2 is categorized under the "Respond" function and specifically targets "Devices" as the asset type. This classification helps in aligning the control with broader incident response and asset management strategies.

By following these procedures, an organization can enhance its ability to detect and manage unauthorized assets, thereby reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring a more secure network environment.
