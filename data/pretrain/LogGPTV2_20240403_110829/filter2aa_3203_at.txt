### Manually Configured Routes for Subnets

- **Subnet 3 (131.107.24.0/24)** and the rest of the intranet (10.0.0.0/8) require manually configured routes.
- To route packets from **Subnet 2** and **Subnet 3** to the rest of the intranet, the routing table for **Router B** must include:
  - Manually configured routes for **Subnet 1 (131.107.8.0/24)** and the rest of the intranet (10.0.0.0/8).
- To route packets from **Subnet 3** and the rest of the intranet to **Subnets 1 and 2**, the routing table for the **RIP router** must include:
  - Manually configured routes for **Subnet 1 (131.107.8.0/24)** and **Subnet 2 (131.107.16.0/24)**.

### Integrating Static and Dynamic Routing

- **Figure 5-6** illustrates the integration of static and dynamic routing.
- The routing tables in **Figure 5-6** do not show the routes for directly attached subnets or other routes learned by the RIP router.

### IPv4 Route Aggregation and Summarization

- **Routing protocols** can propagate individual routes for each subnet on an IPv4 network to each router.
- For large networks with hundreds or thousands of subnets, it is more efficient to configure routers or routing protocols to advertise **aggregate or summarized routes** rather than all individual routes within a region.

#### Example of Route Summarization

- A specific site of a large private network uses subnets **10.73.0.0/24** to **10.73.255.0/24** (up to 256 subnets).
- Instead of advertising up to 256 routes, you can configure the edge routers to advertise a single route: **10.73.0.0/16**.
- This single route summarizes the entire address space used by the site.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**:
  - Only a single route is advertised outside the site, reducing the number of routes in the routing tables of external routers.
  - Protects the rest of the IPv4 network from **route flapping** (frequent propagation of routing updates when networks become available or unavailable).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Traffic destined for unreachable addresses within the summarized address space may traverse multiple routers before being discarded.

### Route Summarization for Internet Address Classes: Supernetting

- With the growth of the Internet, class B address prefixes were at risk of depletion.
- To address this, the **Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)** began assigning ranges of class C address prefixes instead of a single class B prefix.
- This technique, known as **supernetting**, allows organizations to have enough network and host IDs without depleting class B address prefixes.

#### Example of Supernetting

- Instead of allocating a class B address prefix to an organization with up to 2,000 hosts, ICANN allocates a range of eight class C address prefixes.
- Each class C address prefix accommodates 254 hosts, totaling 2,032 host IDs.

#### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

- **CIDR** is used to collapse multiple address prefix entries into a single entry.
- For example, if eight class C address prefixes are allocated starting with **220.78.168.0**:
  - The starting address prefix is **220.78.168.0** (11011100 01001110 10101000 00000000).
  - The ending address prefix is **220.78.175.0** (11011100 01001110 10101111 00000000).
  - The first 21 bits are the same, so the CIDR entry in the routing tables becomes **220.78.168.0/21**.

### IPv4 Routing Support in Windows

- **Windows Server 2003** supports both static and dynamic IPv4 routing.
- **Windows XP** supports only static IPv4 routing.

#### Enabling Static Routing

- You can enable static routing through:
  - The **IPEnableRouter** registry entry.
  - The **Routing and Remote Access service**.

##### Using the IPEnableRouter Registry Entry

- For **Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003**:
  - Set the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\IPEnableRouter` registry entry to 1 (data type is REG_DWORD).

##### Using the Routing and Remote Access Service

- For **Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003**:
  - Use the **Routing and Remote Access service** to enable IPv4 routing.
  - Run the **Routing and Remote Access Server Setup Wizard**:
    1. In the console tree of the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, right-click the server, and click **Configure And Enable Routing and Remote Access**.
    2. Follow the wizard instructions.
  - Choose **Custom Configuration** and **LAN Routing** to enable simple IPv4 routing.

#### Enabling Dynamic Routing with RIP and OSPF

- You can enable dynamic routing through the **Routing and Remote Access service**.
- Configure and enable the **Routing and Remote Access service**.
- Add the **RIP and OSPF routing protocol components** and configure interfaces on which they are enabled.
- **OSPF** is not supported in **Windows Server 2008**.

### Configuring Hosts for IPv4 Routing

- **IPv4 hosts** can use the following methods to reach remote destinations:
  - Store a host-specific route to each remote destination (not practical).
  - Store a route to each remote subnet (more practical but still impractical for large networks).
  - Store a single default route that summarizes all locations not on the local subnet (most practical).

#### Default Gateway Setting

- The **default gateway** setting creates a default route in the IPv4 routing table.
- The default route has a destination of **0.0.0.0/0** and the next-hop address is set to the IPv4 address of the default gateway.
- The default route matches all destinations and is used if no other route matches the destination more closely.

#### Configuring a Default Gateway

- **DHCP**: The default gateway is the first IPv4 address in the Router DHCP option.
- **Manual Configuration**: The default gateway is specified in the properties of the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** component.
- **APIPA**: No default gateway is configured; APIPA supports only a single subnet.

#### ICMP Router Discovery

- **ICMP Router Discovery** provides an alternate method for configuring and detecting default gateways.
- Hosts can dynamically discover routers on a subnet and switch to a backup router if the primary router fails.
- **TCP/IP for Windows** supports sending ICMP router solicitations and receiving ICMP router advertisements (host-side router discovery).
- The **Routing and Remote Access service** in **Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003** supports sending ICMP router advertisements (router-side router discovery).

#### Adding Static Routes

- Use the **Route tool** to add entries to the IPv4 routing table.
- Examples:
  - `route add 131.107.24.192 mask 255.255.255.255 131.107.1.1`
  - `route add 131.107.3.0 mask 255.255.255.0 131.107.1.2`

#### Persistent Static Routes

- Use the `-p` option with the **Route tool** to make routes persistent by storing them in the registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP\PersistentRoutes`.

#### RIP Listener

- **RIP Listener** is an optional networking component that listens for RIP v1 and RIP v2 traffic and updates its IPv4 routing table.
- Install it through the **Programs and Features** item in Control Panel on **Windows Vista** or **Add or Remove Programs** on **Windows XP Professional**.

### Routing for Disjoint Networks

- If a computer has multiple interfaces and a default gateway is configured for each interface, the default route metric (based on interface speed) determines which interface is used for default route traffic.
- This behavior is desirable when multiple adapters are connected to the same network but can be problematic for disjoint networks (networks without symmetric reachability).

#### Examples of Disjoint Networks

- Networks with no Network layer connectivity.
- A privately addressed intranet with a routed connection to the Internet, offering asymmetric reachability.

#### Connectivity to Disjoint Networks

- Organizations often use:
  - **Proxy servers** (e.g., Microsoft ISA Server) or **NAT** to connect private intranets to the Internet.
  - **Virtual Private Networking (VPN) servers** to allow remote users to connect to a private intranet over the Internet.

#### Default Route Selection

- When default gateways are configured on multiple interfaces, the default route chosen by IPv4 is based on the interface's speed and other factors.
