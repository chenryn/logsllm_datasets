title:botconf2017 Thinking Outside of the (Sand)box
During my talk, I will outline the current state of apps that try to break the Android sandbox model, either by directly exploiting the Android device or by trying to circumvent the protections in place. In the past, there has been mentions of malware families that try to interfere with the Android system the same way Windows malware frequently does â€“ by implementing function hooks or code injection. My talk will also show the difficulties faced by malicious authors, their creativity, goals and ways that Android system security features prevent such behaviour.
