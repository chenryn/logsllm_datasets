**Title: Botconf 2017 - Thinking Outside of the (Sand)box**

In my presentation, I will provide an overview of the current state of applications that attempt to break the Android sandbox model. These apps may either directly exploit the Android device or try to bypass the existing security protections. Historically, certain malware families have been known to interfere with the Android system in a manner similar to how Windows malware operatesâ€”by employing function hooks or code injection techniques.

My talk will also highlight the challenges faced by malicious actors, their creative approaches, and their objectives. Additionally, I will discuss the various security features of the Android system that are designed to prevent such malicious behavior.
