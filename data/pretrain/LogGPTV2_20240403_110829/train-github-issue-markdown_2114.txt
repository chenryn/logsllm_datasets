Hello Maarten,

I'd be happy to help clarify the concepts of face and vertex UVs for you. Let's break it down step by step.

### Face UVs
Face UVs are used to map texture coordinates to the faces of a 3D model. The structure you provided is correct:

```plaintext
[ [UV1, UV2, UV3, ...], [UV1, UV2, UV3, ...], ... ]
```

- Each sub-list (e.g., `[UV1, UV2, UV3, ...]`) represents the UV coordinates for one face.
- The order of the UV coordinates in each sub-list corresponds to the order of the vertices that make up the face. For example, if a face is defined by vertices `V1, V2, V3`, then the corresponding UV coordinates should be `UV1, UV2, UV3`.

**Ordering:**
- The order of the UV coordinates in each sub-list is important because it must match the order of the vertices that define the face. This ensures that the texture is applied correctly.
- The order does not need to be increasing (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9), but it must correspond to the vertices in the face.

### Vertex UVs
Vertex UVs, on the other hand, store UV coordinates at the vertex level. This means that each vertex has its own set of UV coordinates. The structure you provided is a bit more complex, but let's simplify it:

```plaintext
[ [ [UV1, UV2, UV3], [UV4, UV5, UV6], ... ], [ [UV1, UV2, UV3], [UV4, UV5, UV6], ... ], ... ]
```

- The outermost list contains multiple sets of UV coordinates.
- Each inner list (e.g., `[ [UV1, UV2, UV3], [UV4, UV5, UV6], ... ]`) represents the UV coordinates for a single vertex.
- The second set of brackets (e.g., `[UV1, UV2, UV3]`) contains the UV coordinates for the vertex in different UV maps or layers.

**Understanding:**
- In vertex UVs, each vertex can have multiple UV coordinates, which can be useful for different texture maps (e.g., color, normal, specular).
- The order of the UV coordinates in the inner lists is typically based on the UV map or layer they belong to.

### Differences and Necessity
- **Face UVs** are simpler and are often used when each face needs its own unique UV mapping.
- **Vertex UVs** are more flexible and allow for shared UV coordinates across multiple faces, which can be more efficient and reduce texture seams.

**Do you need both?**
- It depends on your specific use case. If you need to apply different textures to different parts of the model, or if you want to share UV coordinates across multiple faces, vertex UVs might be more appropriate.
- If you have a simple model where each face has its own unique texture, face UVs might suffice.

I hope this helps clarify the concepts for you. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!
