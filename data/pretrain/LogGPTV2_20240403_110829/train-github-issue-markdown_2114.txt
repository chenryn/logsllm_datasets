hi there, i have a question about face and vertex uvs ....
i sort of understend the face uv .... wich works in the faces list with a
index ....
[ [ UV1, UV2, UV3, … ], [ UV1, UV2, UV3, … ], … ];
the extra [ ] is one face and thats where the index points at ..... (please,
correct me if im wrong)  
and every value in there is one corner of the face the position of the vertex
in the texture editor ...  
if im right ... does it matter in what order the come in or do they have to be
sorted so i get a  
increasing value ( 1,2,3,5, 7,8,9,)
the vertex list is a different story ..... whats the difference and do you
need them both?
[ [ [UV1, UV2, UV3], [UV4, UV5, UV6],… ], [ [UV1, UV2, UV3], [UV4, UV5, UV6],…
], … ];
another extra [ ] the first set of [ ] is a face and the second set is the
values og the uvs surounding the vertex? but were looking at vertecies and not
faces this doesnt make realy alot of sence to me ...... and what information
of the position of the vertx doe you have if the surrounding faces are not
conected ...... i realy stuck on this one
can anybody clear this up for me please?
