These only show up in oldnumeric when 2to3 with the 2to3 renames and nonzero
fixers. The replacement for `sys.maxint` in python3 is `sys.maxsize`, but the
two aren't the same, the latter the size of `Py_ssize_t`. Likewise the the
replacement for `__nonzero` is `__bool__`, but anyone using old numeric is
likely to have made the change.
Because oldnumeric will go away, I suggest we leave those attributes unchanged
and advertize that oldnumeric isn't supported in python 3.
