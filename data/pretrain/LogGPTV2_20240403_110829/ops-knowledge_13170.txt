User: I'm installing CUDA 8.0 on my MacBook Pro running Sierra (by way of installing TensorFlow). Very new to GPU computing; I've only ever worked in Python at a very high level (lots of data analysis using numpy). Most of the language on the CUDA website assumes knowledge I don't have. Specifically, I have no idea how to 1) run the sample programs included in the Samples file, and 2) how to "change library pathnames in my .bashrc file" (I'm fairly sure I don't have a .bashrc file, just .bash_history and .bash_profile.
How to I do the above? And are there any good ground-up references online for someone very new to all this?
Assistant: First copy samples folder from installation folder somewhere else, for example your home directory. Then navigate to sample you wish to run type make and it should create executable file. 
For example in folder samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery you should get exec file named deviceQuery and you can run it ./deviceQuery
edit: Just noticed that you are familiar more with python than C, therefore you should check out pyCUDA
