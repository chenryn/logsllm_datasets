Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of multiple child processes in the mod_jk software component. The log shows that the workerEnv.init() was successful, but the mod_jk child workerEnv was in an error state 6 or 7. The log also shows that multiple child processes were found in the scoreboard slots 6, 7, and 8.
