ABSTRACT
Online advertising is progressively moving towards a programmatic
model in which ads are matched to actual interests of individuals
collected as they browse the web. Le(cid:138)ing the huge debate around
privacy aside, a very important question in this area, for which li(cid:138)le
is known, is: How much do advertisers pay to reach an individual?
In this study, we develop a (cid:128)rst of its kind methodology for
computing exactly that – the price paid for a web user by the ad
ecosystem – and we do that in real time. Our approach is based
on tapping on the Real Time Bidding (RTB) protocol to collect
cleartext and encrypted prices for winning bids paid by advertisers
in order to place targeted ads. Our main technical contribution is a
method for tallying winning bids even when they are encrypted.
We achieve this by training a model using as ground truth prices
obtained by running our own “probe” ad-campaigns. We design our
methodology through a browser extension and a back-end server
that provides it with fresh models for encrypted bids. We validate
our methodology using a one year long trace of 1600 mobile users
and demonstrate that it can estimate a user’s advertising worth
with more than 82% accuracy.
1 INTRODUCTION
In today’s data-driven economy, the amount of user data an IT com-
pany holds has a direct and non-trivial contribution to its overall
market valuation [73]. Digital advertising is the most important
means of monetizing such user data. It grew to $194.6 billion in
2016 [75] of which $108 billion were due to mobile advertising. In
fact, more and more companies rush to participate in this rapidly
growing advertising business either as advertisers, ad-exchanges
(ADXs), demand-side platforms (DSPs), data management platforms
(DMPs), or all of the above. For these companies to increase their
market share, they need to deliver more e(cid:130)ective and highly tar-
geted advertisements. A way to achieve this is through program-
matic instantaneous auctions. An important enabler for this kind

of auctions is the Real-Time Bidding (RTB) protocol for transact-
ing digital display ads in real time. RTB has been growing with
an annual rate of 128% [80], and currently accounts for 74% of
programmatically purchased advertising. In US alone it created a
revenue of $8.7 billion in 2016 [8].
Consequently, the collection of user personal data has become
more aggressive and sometimes even intrusive [29, 33], raising a
huge public debate around the tradeo(cid:130)s between (i) innovation
in advertising and marketing, and (ii) basic civil rights regarding
privacy and personal data protection [51, 55]. (cid:140)ese increasing pri-
vacy concerns, drew the a(cid:138)ention of a signi(cid:128)cant body of research,
which studied users’ privacy loss in conjunction to existing user
tracking techniques [1, 17, 21, 52, 60], and proposed various de-
fence mechanisms to users [59, 64, 65]. Still, there is an outstanding
question that remains unaddressed by the related work in the area.
(cid:140)is question concerns transparency and is the following: Based on
the exposed user personal data, how much do advertisers pay to reach
an individual?
Despite the importance of this question, it is surprising how li(cid:138)le
is known about it. (cid:140)ere exist several reports about the average
revenue per user (ARPU) from online advertising [13, 30, 67], but
ARPU, as its name suggests, is just an average. It can be calculated
by dividing the total revenue of a company by the number of its
monthly active users. Computing the revenue per individual user
is a completely di(cid:130)erent ma(cid:138)er for which very limited work is
available.
In particular, the FDVT [14] browser extension can estimate
the value of an individual user for Facebook, by tapping on the
platform’s ad-planner. Another important prior work [62] leverages
similarly the RTB protocol and speci(cid:128)cally its (cid:128)nal stage, where the
winning bidder (advertiser) gets noti(cid:128)ed about the auction’s charge
price per delivered impression. (cid:140)ese charge prices were initially
transmi(cid:138)ed in cleartext and focused solely on them. However, more
and more advertising companies use encryption to reduce the risk
of tampering, falsi(cid:128)cation or monitoring from competitors. (cid:140)is
trend renders that method inapplicable for the current and future ad
ecosystem, whose majority of companies will deploy charge price
encryption. In contrast to these works, our present method takes
into account all the web activity of a user (not only on Facebook),
and all RTB tra(cid:129)c, i.e., both cleartext and encrypted prices.
In this paper, our motivation is to enhance transparency in digital
advertising and shed light on pricing dynamics in its personal data-
driven ecosystem. (cid:140)erefore, we develop and evaluate a (cid:128)rst of its
kind methodology for enabling end-users to estimate in real time

their actual cost for advertisers, even when the la(cid:138)er encrypt the
prices they pay. Designed as a browser extension, our method can
tally winning bids for ads shown to a user and display the resulting
amount as she moves from site to site in real time.
In summary, we make the following main contributions:
(1) We propose the (cid:128)rst to our knowledge holistic methodology to
calculate the overall cost of a user for the RTB ad ecosystem,
using both encrypted and cleartext price noti(cid:128)cations from RTB-
based auctions.
(2) We study the feasibility and e(cid:129)ciency of our proposed method
by analyzing a year-long weblog of 1600 real mobile users. Ad-
ditionally, we design and perform an a(cid:130)ordable (a few hun-
dred dollars cost) 2-phase real world ad-campaign targeting
ad-exchanges delivering cleartext and encrypted prices in or-
der to enhance the real-users’ extracted prices. We show that
even with a handful of features extracted from the ad-campaign,
our methodology achieves an accuracy > 82%. (cid:140)e resulting
ARPU is ∼55% higher than that computed based on cleartext
RTB prices alone. Our (cid:128)ndings challenge the related work’s
basic assumption [62] that encrypted and plain text prices are
similar (we found encrypted prices to be ∼1.7× higher). Finally,
we validate our methodology by comparing our average esti-
mated user cost with the reported per user revenue of major
advertising companies.
(3) Using lessons from the study, we design a system where the
users, by using a Chrome browser extension, can estimate in
real-time, in a privacy-preserving fashion on the client side, the
overall cost advertisers pay for them based on their exposed per-
sonal information. In addition, they can also contribute anony-
mously their impression charge prices to a centralized platform
for further research.
Paper Organization. Section 2 summarizes various key concepts
of the RTB ecosystem and presents the main challenge and moti-
vation of our work. Section 3 provides a high-level overview of
our novel methodology and our price modeling engine. Section 4
presents an analysis of the dataset we use to bootstrap our modeling
of encrypted prices. Section 5 presents in detail the e(cid:130)ort to model
RTB charge prices by executing probing ad-campaigns. (cid:140)ese cam-
paigns provide ground-truth data, which is used to train a machine
learning classi(cid:128)er that can estimate encrypted prices in real-time
at the browser of a user. Section 6 puts all the pieces together and
presents results on the overall monetary cost for displaying ads
to users. Section 7 covers related work while Section 8 discuses
various aspects of our work and concludes the paper.
2 BACKGROUND ON RTB
RTB accounts for 74% of programmatically purchased advertising,
reaching a total revenue of $8.7 billion in US [8], allowing advertis-
ers to evaluate the collected data of a given user at real-time and bid
for an ad-slot in the user’s display. Next, we brie(cid:131)y cover the most
important aspects of RTB auctions, key entities involved (§ 2.1),
and how they are relevant to our study (§ 2.2).
2.1 (cid:135)e key players
As it can be seen in Figure 1, the key roles of the RTB ecosystem
include the Advertiser, Publisher, DSP, Ad-exchange, and SSP, which

is (cid:128)nally converted to money.
interact with each other in several ways [4]. Note that it is very
common for some (large) companies to play simultaneously di(cid:130)er-
ent roles even inside the same auction (e.g. Google’s DoubleClick
Bid Manager [28] and DoubleClick for Publishers [23].
Publisher: (e.g., CNN.com) is the owner of a website, where users
browse for content and receive ads (step 1). Each time a user visits
the website, an auction takes place for each available ad slot. (cid:140)e
ad impression of the winning advertiser is (cid:128)nally displayed in each
auctioned slot of the website.
Advertiser: is the buyer of a website’s ad slots. (cid:140)e advertiser cre-
ates ad campaigns and de(cid:128)nes the audience that has to be targeted
according to his marketing objectives, budgets, strategies, etc. In
each auction, the one with the highest bid wins the ad slot and
places its impression on the screen of the website’s visitor.
Supply-Side Platform (SSP): is an agency platform, which en-
ables publishers to manage their inventory of available ad slots and
their pricing, allocate ad impressions from di(cid:130)erent channels (e.g.
RTB or back(cid:128)ll in case of unsold inventory [46]) and receive rev-
enue1. SSP is also responsible for interfacing the publisher’s side to
multiple ad-exchanges (step 2) and aggregate/manage publisher’s
connections with multiple ad networks and buyers. In addition,
by using web beacons and cookie synchronization, SSPs perform
user tracking in order to be(cid:138)er con(cid:128)gure their ad slots’ pricing
and achieve as many re-targeting ads as possible and thus higher
bids [43]. Popular vendors selling SSP technology are OpenX, Pub-
Matic, Rubicon Project, Right Media.
Ad-exchange (ADX): is a digital, real-time marketplace that, sim-
ilarly to a stock exchange, enables advertisers and publishers to
buy and sell advertising space through RTB-based auctions. ADX
is responsible for hosting an RTB-based auction and distribute the
ad requests along with user information it owns (i.e. browsing
history, demographics, location, cookie-related info) among all the
interested auction participants (step 3).
Typically these auctions follow the second higher price model
(i.e. Vickrey auctions) [79], thus, the charge price for the winner
of the slot is the second highest submi(cid:138)ed. A(cid:137)er the auction, the
