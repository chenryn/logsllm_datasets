Abstract. Since the early 2000’s, Internet topology discovery has been
an active research topic, providing data for various studies such as Inter-
net modeling, network management, or to assist and support network
protocol design. Within this research area, ISP mapping at the router
level has attracted little interest despite its utility to perform intra-
domain routing evaluation. Since Rocketfuel (and, to a smaller extent,
mrinfo), no new tool or method has emerged for systematically mapping
intra-domain topologies.
In this paper, we introduce Anaximander, a new eﬃcient approach
for probing and discovering a targeted ISP in particular. Considering a
given set of vantage points, we implement and combine several predictive
strategies to mitigate the number of probes to be sent without sacriﬁc-
ing the ISP coverage. To assess the ability of our method to eﬃciently
retrieve an ISP map, we rely on a large dataset of ISPs having distinct
nature and demonstrate how Anaximander can be tuned with a simple
parameter to control the trade-oﬀ between coverage and probing budget.

Introduction
For the last 20 years, Internet topology discovery has attracted a lot of attention
from the research community [9,17]. Those researches have focused on eﬃcient
data collection (e.g., Doubletree [10]), on alias resolution [21], on ISP mapping
(e.g., Rocketfuel [40] and mrinfo [31]), or on Internet modeling [35].
Despite being man-made, much of the Internet is hidden and unknown, for
the reason that it is a large and complex system that does not consist in a
single authoritative entity. Rather, it is made up of more than 72,000 indepen-
dent Autonomous Systems (ASes), each having its own commercial practices,
physical infrastructure, and logical design (in particular its routing and Traﬃc
Engineering – TE – strategies). More precisely, to deploy a speciﬁc routing strat-
egy (from best-eﬀort traﬃc to more complex strategies, such as fast re-routing),

ISPs generally assign an IGP weight to each link and then elaborate more or
less complex strategies to control packet forwarding according to a given set of
network metrics, related constraints, and technology [36].
Consequently, blindly sampling (a subset of) the Internet is not enough to
reveal and discriminate such speciﬁc topological and routing patterns, or generic
ones if they are any. Instead, in order to conduct relevant TE and IGP perfor-
mance evaluations [13] and showcase the performance of a given routing proposal
(with simulations or analytical models), it is more suitable to rely on distinct ISP
maps oﬀering various realistic situations, rather than using an arbitrary chunk
of the Internet.
To answer this requirement and oﬀer a framework for reproducible realistic
experimentation, one needs to collect intra-domain networks of distinct natures
(e.g., Tier-1, Transit, and Stub ASes of diverse sizes). We thus argue it is essential
to develop modern, accurate, and advanced topology discovery tools able to
skillfully capture the reality of the Internet, in particular considering its atomistic
technical nature. The goal is therefore to search for eﬃcient probing designs able
to reveal the speciﬁcs of any given intra-domain router level map.
While Rocketfuel [40] topologies have been the de facto dataset in use for
nearly two decades, we argue that both the resulting topologies and the underly-
ing probing methods are now outdated. Indeed, the Internet structure and prac-
tices have evolved over time, and new reﬁned measurements tools have become
available as well [2,25]. In this paper, we pursue the same objective as Rocket-
fuel formerly, i.e., to map speciﬁc ISPs at the router level. More speciﬁcally, we
tackle the following challenge: Can we infer ISP router level maps with a reduced
probing budget without hampering the resulting topological coverage? Designing
eﬃcient probing campaigns is indeed essential to speed up the measurement
period and so mitigate forwarding anomalies (e.g., routing changes [48,50]), and
the eﬀects of adaptative ﬁltering (e.g., rate limiters [16,37]). Otherwise, the data
collected may not be consistent or suﬀer from poor coverage.
We ﬁrst point out Rocketfuel limits for capturing nowadays Internet maps
but also revisit its successful components when their eﬃciency is still valuable.
Then, we develop our own strategies and evaluate them relying on a large and
recent dataset to conduct realistic simulations and support our assumptions.
More precisely, we replay measurements oﬄine using diﬀerent approaches than
the initial brute-force approach in order to understand what are the correspond-
ing gains and losses. The reduction strategies we evaluate are diverse and span
from the design of the initial hitlist and its scheduling to speciﬁc reduction tech-
niques looking at preﬁx de-aggregation and neighbor marginal utility. To answer
our research question, this paper introduces Anaximander, our new probing
method able to recover the same ISP maps as obtained with a brute force app-
roach, but with a network-friendly and eﬃcient probing methodology. For a given
set of vantage points, Anaximander is able to adapt itself to the characteristics
of the ISP being mapped. It constructs and manages a target list in order to
eﬃciently cover most of the visible part of the targeted ISP topology. Addition-
ally, our tool oﬀers the opportunity to easily explore the trade-oﬀ between AS
coverage and probing budget, with a single parameter.

2 Related Work
Most active probing tools based on traceroute embed some heuristics to limit
the probing overhead. Such heuristics generally rely on caching previously seen
IP addresses to avoid redundancy. For example, for a given preﬁx P , Merca-
tor [14] identiﬁes the furthest router R that was already in the map at the time
the probe completed. Then, each subsequent probes to P can start at the TLL
of R: if the reply comes from R, Mercator continues to probe the path, other-
wise it backtracks and restarts probing with a regular TTL of one. Atlas [47]
probes IPv6 networks using source routed IPv6 traceroute. For each trace,
Atlas caches the hop distance to the via-router, i.e., the intermediate router
used for source routing. If the same via-router is used in a subsequent trace,
then the cache distance provides the initial hop distance and alleviates the need
to re-probe from the vantage point to that via-router. Scriptroute [41] avoids
retracing paths by embedding a list of previously observed IP addresses. A given
vantage point stops probing when it reaches an IP address belonging to the
list. More generally, Doubletree [10] keeps track of the tree-like structure of
routes, either emanating from a single source towards multiple destinations or
converging from multiple sources towards a single destination, to avoid probing
duplication. Rocketfuel [40], probably the most well-known intra-domain topol-
ogy discovery tool, relies on two reduction techniques, namely ingress and egress
reductions, to reduce its probing budget. While the ﬁrst considers that probes
to a given destination should converge if they enter the targeted ISP at the same
ingress node, the second advocates that traces from the same ingress to any pre-
ﬁx beyond the same egress should traverse the same path. Generally speaking,
Rocketfuel relies on BGP to guide the probing and builds a router-level map
of the targeted domain using Ally. However, it has been shown that Rocketfuel
tends to overestimate the path diversity of the targeted domain [42]. Section 4
will investigate more deeply the (other) limits of Rocketfuel. Finally, it is worth
noticing heuristics have also been proposed to increase the number of nodes
discovered, e.g., POPsicle [11].
With respect to ISP mapping, few other tools than traceroute and Rocket-
fuel exist. There is notably [51], that focuses on the exploration of an essential
component of an ISP’s infrastructure: its regional access network. By combining
several Internet cartography methods (such as public WiFi hotspots and pub-
lic transit of mobile devices), they are able to get some insight on this speciﬁc
ISP portion, although it is often remarkably opaque and diﬃcult to measure.
There is also mrinfo [20], that relies on the Internet Group Management Pro-
tocol (IGMP) to enable native router level query. The IGMP reply consists in a
444
E. Marechal et al.
list of local multicast interfaces and their link with adjacent interfaces. Recur-
sively querying adjacent interfaces can thus lead to the collection of connected
topological information [31]. Pansiot et al. [34] have also provided algorithms for
eﬃciently delimiting AS boundaries to extract ISP maps from such data. Mer-
lin [26] extends mrinfo by increasing its eﬃciency but also mixes IGMP probing
with ICMP probing (Paris Traceroute [2] and Ally [40] are used to overcome
mrinfo limitations). However, IGMP queries are now deprecated and opera-
tors ﬁlter them at their borders [27], making those techniques unusable. The
Internet topology zoo [23] and similar projects like SNDlib1 expose real intra-
domain maps manually collected from operators providing their own network
maps. However, although useful for TE related reproducible experiments, such
datasets are often insuﬃcient as they do not expose large and up to date maps
of the Internet. Many are outdated and correspond to small, sometimes partial,
IP networks not revealing all relevant information (e.g., IGP weights, node posi-
tions, or propagation delays). Eventually, Sybil [6] is a system that can serve a
rich set of queries about Internet routes, including what routes go through an
ISP of interest. However, in the background, Sybil needs to continuously run
measurements in order to maintain its knowledge of routing. This paradigm,
which requires a database of (relatively fresh) previously-issued traceroutes,
is a great departure from the one-shot campaign that can be run more quickly
and easily.
Our goal is to provide a light probing framework enabling the deployment of
repeated probing campaigns enriched with all available information brought by
forwarding traces.
3 Dataset
The traceroute data used throughout this paper has been collected by Caida
with TNT [25,44]. TNT is a Paris-traceroute [2] extension that is able to reveal the
content of MPLS tunnels hidden to traceroute exploration [46].
TNT has been deployed on the Archipelageo infrastructure [5] between April
17th and 23rd, 2021 over 14 vantage points (VPs), scattered all around the world:
Europe (6), North America (1), South America (3), Asia (2), and Australia (2).
The overall set of destinations, over 11 million IP addresses, is spread over the
14 vantage points to speed up the probing process.
A total of 936,944 distinct unique IP addresses (excluding traceroute
targets) have been collected, without counting non-publicly routable addresses,
which have been excluded from our dataset. As we are interested in mapping
ISPs2 (as opposed to the whole Internet), we applied bdrmapIT [29], a tool for
annotating routers and IP addresses with AS ownership. The objective here is
to delimit as accurately as possible the ASes maps from the rest of the Internet.
bdrmapIT’s inferences are more meaningful when the tool is provided with
information about routers, and not only IP addresses found in the traceroutes.
