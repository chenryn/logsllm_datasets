2.1 Growth in Guestbook Activity
Figure 2: Cyworld growth in numbers
4The period of guestbook logs does not match that of the friends
network in [2]. We could not retrieve the friends network from the
same period as the guestbook logs.
Figure 3: Growth in the numbers of guestbooks and messages
versus the number of users
The total number of guestbooks that users have written does not
increase very fast after the number of users exceeds 10 million.
No social network can sustain an explosive growth forever, and its
growth rate must slow down at some point. As Cyworld is lim-
ited to Korean-speaking populace of 70 million to 100 million6,
the slow-down in growth in around July 2004 or at about 8 mil-
lion is markedly interesting. We do not have data from other social
networking services, but take a mental note that at about 10% of
the target market size the growth slows down. Similar slow-down
in growth has been observed in bulletin board systems (BBS) of a
university as well [17]. In this network, BBS users are connected
through message posting like leaving comments in the guestbook.
The number of users in BBSs grow exponentially, but the growth
rate eventually drops below an exponential rate. The total number
of links and the total weight of BBS networks also grow exponen-

tially at the beginning, and then their growth rates slow down sim-
ilarly [15]. The starting point of inevitable slow-down in growth is
of interest to online social networking service (OSNS) providers, as
it marks a transition from a fast-growing phase to a steady growth.
Our observation is just one exemplary data point, and we leave the
correlation between the point of transition and the expected popu-
lation of the service for future work.
2.2 Self-Posting in Guestbook
When a friend writes a message on a guestbook, the owner of
the guestbook often replies in one’s own guestbook, instead of vis-
iting the friend’s guestbook and writing there. This activity is cap-
tured in our guestbook log as a 3-tuple that has the same writer
and owner. We call this tuple a self-post. Self-posts take up about
a third or 38.9% in all posts, and they are evenly distributed over
time. Also 81.8% of users who have written at least once have writ-
ten a self-post. For half of the users, a third of messages they wrote
are self-posts. Self-posts make up a non-negligible portion and we
should determine how to interpret self-posts before analyzing user
activities of guestbook logs.
A self-post serves either of the two purposes: a message for
viewing by all others (a notice) or a reply speciﬁcally for a pre-
ceding message. We cannot distinguish a notice from a reply in the
guestbook log, as they both appear as 3-tuples with the same writer
and owner. As Cyworld offers two other features, the bulletin board
and the public diary, that both serve a similar purpose for notices
and announcements, we assume most self-posts are replies for this
work.
the actual recipient. For example, a minihomy owner has received
messages from users i and j, and writes one self-post a few days
later. Is the self-post meant for user i, user j, or both? We cannot
tell from the data we have. However, self-posts are an important
aspect of user activity, and we cannot drop them completely in our
analysis. In the rest of the paper, we make it explicit whether we
include self-posts in the analysis or not.
2.3 Activity Network
Graph representation of a social network is an apt abstraction of
their connected nature and allows us to tap into the rich repository
of graph and complex network theories. In this section we describe
how we represent the user interaction on the guestbook as a graph
and deﬁne metrics of interaction.
In a network of nodes and edges without directions, a node de-
gree refers to the total number of edges. For the guestbook activity,
we construct a network with weighted and directed edges. We map
a user to a node and a message to a directed edge from a writer to
a reader (we refer to a user and a node interchangeably). An edge
from node i to node j denotes that user i has written a message on
user j’s guestbook. The weight, wij, of a directed edge from i to j
is the number of messages user i has written to user j. A node in a
directed network has two degrees: an in-degree and an out-degree.
We often refer to an out-degree in a directed network as the degree,
and specify in-degrees when necessary.
In a weighted network, a node strength represents the sum of all
weights of outgoing edges. The strength of node i with out-degree
k is deﬁned as: si = Σk
j=1wij.
We call a weighted and directed network constructed from the
guestbook log the activity network. Note that the nodes of the activ-
ity network is not a proper subset of that of the friends network, for
users without friend relationships can still write onto one’s guest-
book.
Self-posts map to a reﬂexive edge pointing back at the originat-
ing node itself, and the weight is the number of self-posts. It is
reasonable to include self-posts in the strength, as self-posts are
meant for other users.
Figure 4: Self-posts vs messages received
In Figure 4 we plot the number of self-posts against the number
of messages received per user. There is a strong positive correla-
tion between the two numbers; the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
between the two numbers is 0.8201. Most points lie below the
line, y = x, and about 95.1% of users’ self-posts are smaller than
their received messages. We see a small number of points above
y = x in the left bottom corner. Our guestbook logs only include
comments between registered users of Cyworld and do not contain
comments by non-Cyworld users. Non-Cyworld users can browse
minihompies and write on guestbooks, as long as owners of the
guestbooks allow it. Non-Cyworld users do not have a user id, and
their activity is not logged in our data. This explains those points
above y = x in the left bottom corner.
From above, we conclude that the self-posts represent recipro-
cal activity, but face a dilemma because we cannot disambiguate
Figure 5: CCDF of strength and degrees of the activity network
In Figure 5 we plot four complementary cumulative distribution
functions (CCDFs) of the strengths and out-degrees of the activity
network; two of them are daily averages of the strength and the
out-degree.
As our guestbook data is from the period of explosive growth,
a large number of users have joined and the time of membership
initiation should be taken into consideration. Not all users write on
a guestbook as soon as they join Cyworld and a gap exists between
the times of a membership initiation and the ﬁrst guestbook activity.
Hence, daily averages of node strength and degree are calculated by
taking the cumulative node strength and degree by October 2005
and dividing them by the number of days since the ﬁrst time a user
has written a message during our dataset period.
The plots in Figure 5 all have conspicuous straight drops near the
end. As the weight represents the total number of comments on a
guestbook, those drops mark the physical limit of a Cyworld users’
activity. The strength and daily average strength drop at around
980,000 and 4,000, respectively. If a user took 10 seconds for each
comment, then the daily average strength of 4, 000 means that the
user spent more than 10 hours a day! This is a remarkable feat
unless we suspect them of using an automated script. We see a
need to investigate those users who seem to have hit the physical
limit in more detail.
All Cyworld users have to register with one’s national identiﬁca-
tion number (like the social security number in the US). Foreigners
have a similar provision but with a different identiﬁcation. At this
point we have no basis to consider rampant illicit use of identity.
However, occasional appearances of spammers are possible, and
they must have used an automated script. Even though automated
scripts are banned in Cyworld, a limited number of users have taken
the liberty to use them. The site has kept up with catching those
abusers, but the list is never complete. Guestbook comments en-
tered by automated scripts are most likely to be close in time, and
the number of daily comments to surpass a reasonable number ex-
pected from manual input. However, we are aware of legitimate
users whose use of automated scripts is condoned by the site.
The goal of this work is to conduct a macroscopic comparison of
friend relationships and underlying social interaction. As we have
seen in [2], cyber-only relationships are common and they often
lead the growth of the service site. Thus we include all comments,
suspected of automated scripts or not, in this study and leave the
separation of scripted comments for future work.
3. STRUCTURE OF ACTIVITY NETWORK
In this section, we compare the topological characteristics of the
friend relationship and activity networks to analyze the basic struc-
tural characteristics of the network, and to observe how the activity
network differs from the friend relationship network in structural
aspects. We analyze three fundamental metrics: degree distribu-
tion, the clustering coefﬁcient distribution, the degree correlation.
We include the plots of the friend relationship network of Cyworld
as a reference (as of November 2005) [2].
3.1 Degree
First, we plot the degree distribution of the activity network and
the friend relationship network. The degree distribution of the friends
network has revealed that the Cyworld friends network has two dif-
ferent scaling regions in a power-law distribution. The second re-
gion in the power-law distribution attests to existence of users with
very high node degrees, higher than predicted by a power-law dis-
tribution. Ahn et al. have attributed this to cyber-only relationships.
It would be interesting to see if a similar pattern emerges in the ac-
tivity network.
If we take into account the direction of the edges in the network,
the degree of a person can be deﬁned in several ways since there are
both incoming and outgoing edges. We plot three distinct types of
degree distributions: out-degree, in-degree, and bi-directional de-
gree. One’s out-degree is the number of guestbooks one has writ-
ten on, the in-degree is the number of users who have visited and
written on one’s guestbook, and the bi-directional degree represents
the number of people who have reciprocally interacted through the
guestbook. Note that each kind of degree represents a distinctive
perspective; one’s out-degree is one’s own activity, while the in-
degree is the collection of all other people’s activity on the person.
The bi-directional degree is the number of people who reciprocally
interact with the person and ﬁlters out one-sided interaction.
In Figure 6, the in-degree distribution and the out-degree dis-
tribution look similar. It is possible that it is just a coincidence,
i.e. the one’s own activity distribution (out-degree) coincides with
the popularity distribution (in-degree). However, there is a much
more persuasive explanation that this similarity is the manifesta-
tion of strong underlying reciprocity of the communication. The
bi-directional degree distribution also supports this explanation. It
still shows two scaling regions, the second of which stretches over
10, 000. There are apparently a fair number of people who interact
reciprocally with more than hundreds or thousands of people. This
ﬁnding supports that the activity is highly reciprocal. We will delve
into the reciprocity in the Section 4.1.
On the other hand, the in-degree and out-degree distributions
have small but notable differences. The out-degree distribution ex-
hibits sharp cut-off between 105 and 106, while the in-degree dis-
tribution shows a smooth tail.
It is consistent with our previous
observation that the node strength has an upper bound due to phys-
ical limits, while the in-degree has none.
3.2 Clustering
In a network with only unweighted and undirected edges, the
clustering coefﬁcient of a person, which represents how closely
one’s friends are connected, is deﬁned by the ratio of the actual
number of connections over all possible connections between one’s
friends. The clustering coefﬁcient of a network is deﬁned by the
average of individual clustering coefﬁcients. Barrat et al. has pro-
posed a slightly modiﬁed deﬁnition for a weighted network [7].
The deﬁnition of a weighted clustering coefﬁcient for node i is:
X
cw
i =
1
si(ki − 1)
(wij + wih)
j,h
2
aijaihajh
(1)
where ki = Σjaij and aij = 1 if there exists an edge from node i
to node j; aij = 0, otherwise. In the case of the friends network,
(wij + wih)/2 = 1 and si = ki.
We calculate the clustering coefﬁcient of the activity network
with only bi-directional edges. We compare the clustering coefﬁ-
cient for the following two cases: ﬁrst, without the weight of edges
(that is, as if the network is unweighted), and second, with the bi-
directional edges.
The clustering coefﬁcient distribution, C(k), is a mapping of the
mean clustering coefﬁcient of all nodes with degree k to k. The
plots of C(k) is in Figure 7. The mean clustering coefﬁcient of
all nodes, C, is 0.1665. We denote the mean weighted clustering
coefﬁcients of all nodes and of nodes with degree k as C w and
C w(k), respectively. Figure 7 includes C(k) of the bi-directional
network and C w(k) of the weighted bi-directional network.
If
C w(k) > C(k), then the edges with larger weights are more likely
connected. If C w(k) < C(k), then network topology owes more
to the lightly weighted edges than to those with large weights [7].
In Figure 7(a) we see that C w(k) < C(k) for the most part. The
bi-directional weighted activity network has C w of 0.0965, which
is smaller than C = 0.1665. To translate this to our context with
the activity network, much of the user interaction (here, weights)
is carried over edges not belonging to triangularly clustered con-
nections (a.k.a. completely mutual triads). We revisit this issue of
microscopic clustering in Section 4.3.
