User: How to implement process management and resource limitation in Docker container?
Assistant: In the Docker container, you can use the parameters of the docker run command for process management and resource limitation. The following are some common parameters: 1. --memory: Specifies the memory limit used by the container. For example, --memory 512m means to limit the container to use up to 512MB of memory. 2. --cpus: Specifies the CPU resource limit used by the container. For example, --cpus 2 restricts the container to only 2 CPU cores. 3. --detach / -d: Let the container run in the background. 4. --name: Specify a name for the container. 5. --restart: Specifies the container restart policy. 6. --pid: Specifies the PID namespace of the container space used after the container starts. 7. --net: Specifies the network configuration used by the container. 8. --publish / -p: Map the port inside the container to the host. 9. --read-only: Specifies that the container read-only file system access. 10. --tmpfs: Create a temporary file system for the container, which will use the host memory. The above parameters can be used at the same time and can be specified as needed. Additionally, processes can be viewed and managed within a running container using the docker exec command.
