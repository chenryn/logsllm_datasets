### 4. Customizing DAVIX ISO Image

You may need to modify the DAVIX image to meet your specific requirements. Thanks to SLAX, customizing your CD with your own configuration and adding or removing modules is straightforward. This chapter outlines the steps for customization, which can be done under both Linux and Windows.

#### 4.1. Windows

**General Steps:**
1. Create a new directory on your hard drive, e.g., `D:\mydavix\`.
2. Copy the `boot` and `slax` directories to the newly created directory.
3. Make your changes according to the instructions in the following chapters.
4. Open a DOS prompt.
5. Navigate to the `slax` directory on your hard drive using the command:
   ```sh
   cd /d D:\mydavix\slax\
   ```
6. Execute the following command to build the ISO image:
   ```sh
   make_iso.bat D:\mydavix\mydavix.iso
   ```
7. Either burn the created ISO image `mydavix.iso` to a CD-ROM/DVD or use any other deployment method as documented in the chapter "Deployment Options."

#### 4.2. Linux

**General Steps:**
1. Open a console.
2. Insert the DAVIX CD into your CD or DVD drive. On some Linux systems, the CD will automatically be mounted into `/mnt/hdc`.
3. If the DAVIX CD or DVD does not mount automatically, you can mount it manually:
   ```sh
   mount /dev/hdc /mnt/hdc
   ```
4. Create a new directory on your hard drive, e.g.:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p /tmp/mydavix
   ```
5. Copy the `boot` and `slax` directories to the newly created directory:
   ```sh
   cp -pvR /mnt/hdc/boot /mnt/hdc/slax /tmp/mydavix
   ```
6. Make your changes according to the instructions in the following chapters.
7. Navigate to the `slax` directory on your hard drive using the command:
   ```sh
   cd /tmp/mydavix/slax
   ```
8. Execute the following command to build the ISO image:
   ```sh
   ./make_iso.sh /tmp/mydavix/mydavix.iso
   ```
9. Either burn the created ISO image `mydavix.iso` to a CD-ROM/DVD or use any other deployment method as documented in the chapter "Deployment Options."

#### 4.3. Adding and Removing Modules

After copying all the SLAX files to the hard drive, you can customize the SLAX content. Modules can be found in the following directories:
- `slax\base`: SLAX core modules. These will be loaded on every boot.
- `slax\modules`: Standard modules. These will be loaded on every boot.
- `slax\optional`: Optional modules which can be specified in the boot menu.

You can add or remove modules from these directories as needed.

#### 4.4. Overriding Files with rootcopy

If you want to override a specific file in one of the modules, you can use the `slax\rootcopy` directory. The content of `rootcopy` will be applied to the union file system as the last step, allowing you to override any file in the file system. This feature is useful for tweaking single configuration files, such as `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`. For larger changes, the use of modules is recommended.

#### 4.5. Modifying Boot Menu

The boot menu can be modified through the `slax.cfg` file, which can be found in the `boot` directory. Here, you can add or remove additional entries in the boot menu. To add a new entry, append the following section to the file:

```sh
LABEL myconf
MENU LABEL DAVIX Graphics mode (KDE)
KERNEL /boot/vmlinuz
APPEND initrd=/boot/initrd.gz ramdisk_size=6666 root=/dev/ram0 rw changes=slax autoexec=xconf;kdm
TEXT HELP
    Help for currently selected:
    Run DAVIX the max, try to autoconfig graphics card and use the maximum allowed resolution.
ENDTEXT
```

Note that the line with the `APPEND` keyword must be on one line in your `slax.cfg` file to work correctly.

The available boot options are documented in the chapter "Boot Cheat Codes."

#### 4.6. Boot Cheat Codes

SLAX comes with many useful boot options that allow you to tweak boot and kernel behavior. The following list shows an extract of the most important ones. For a complete list, check the SLAX boot parameter page [here](http://www.slax.org/documentation_boot_cheatcodes.php).

- `nodma`: Disable DMA for CD-ROM and hard drives.
- `noauto`: Hard disks are not mounted automatically.
- `nohd`: Hard disks are not mounted.
- `nocd`: CD-ROMs are not mounted.
- `nosound`: Disable sound.
- `password=foobar`: Set root password to `foobar`.
- `password=ask`: Ask for a new password during boot.
- `changes=/dev/hdx`: Stores changes to the specified device.
- `changes=/foo/bar`: Stores changes to the specified directory.
- `changes=/foo.dat`: Stores changes to the specified file.
- `toram`: Copy all CD files to RAM.
- `copy2ram`: Same as `toram`.
- `load=module`: Loads the specified module from `slax\optional`.
- `noload=module`: Disable loading of the specified module.
- `autoexec=xconf;kdm`: After boot, auto-configures X and starts KDM.

### 5. Creating and Modifying Modules

This chapter shows you the different ways to get additional SLAX modules for DAVIX.

#### 5.1. Leverage Existing SLAX Modules

The easiest way to get a new SLAX module is by checking the SLAX website itself. The modules page offers a wide range of contributed, ready-to-use SLAX modules. These modules generally come with all the required libraries and should work right away.

- **SLAX modules:** [http://www.slax.org/modules.php](http://www.slax.org/modules.php)

#### 5.2. Create New Modules from Slackware Packages

Another fast way to get additional modules is to search and download existing Slackware packages and convert them to SLAX modules using the following command:

```sh
tgz2lzm foo-bar-1.0.tgz foo-bar-1.0.lzm
```

- **Search Slackware Packages:** [http://packages.slackware.it/](http://packages.slackware.it/)

This approach does not perform dependency checking, so you will need to investigate the package dependencies yourself and convert all required packages to SLAX modules. The pragmatic approach is to convert the particular module you want to run and integrate it into the DAVIX ISO. Then, boot DAVIX and try to execute one of the binaries in your module. If there is an error indicating a missing library, you have found an unsatisfied dependency. Identify the Slackware package where the library can be found and convert it to a SLAX module. Repeat the testing process as needed.

#### 5.3. Customize Existing SLAX or DAVIX Modules

If you want to tweak a single SLAX or DAVIX package, you can extract a SLAX module using the following command:

```sh
lzm2dir foo-bar-1.0.lzm /foo/bartarget/dir
```

Modify the extracted files to your needs and repack the directory to a SLAX module with the following command:

```sh
dir2lzm /foo/bartarget/dir foo-bar-1.0.lzm
```
