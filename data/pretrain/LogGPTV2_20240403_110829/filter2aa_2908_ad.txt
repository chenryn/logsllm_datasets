Customizing DAVIX ISO Image 
You will most likely get quickly to a point where you want to modify the DAVIX 
image to suite your particular requirements. Thanks to SLAX customizing your CD 
with your own configuration and adding or removing modules is really easy. This 
chapter shows you how to do that. Customizing can either be done under Linux or 
Windows. 
4.1. 
Windows 
The general steps for modifying the DAVIX ISO under Windows are the following: 
• Create a new directory on your hard drive, e.g. D:\mydavix\ 
• Copy the boot and slax directory to the newly created directory. 
• Make your changes according to the instructions in the following chapters. 
• Open a DOS prompt. 
• Navigate to the slax directory on your hard drive using the command: 
cd /d D:\mydavix\slax\ 
• Execute the following command to build the ISO image: 
make_iso.bat d:\mydavix\mydavix.iso 
D:\mydavix\slax>make_iso.bat D:\mydavix\mydavix.iso 
mkisofs 2.01 (i686-pc-cygwin)

New ISO should be created now. 
Press any key to continue . . . 
• Either burn the created ISO image mydavix.iso to a CD-ROM/DVD or use any 
other deployment method as document in the chapter Deployment Options. 
4.2. 
Linux 
The general steps for modifying the DAVIX ISO under Linux are the following. Note 
that hdc is used here as a sample. On you system it could be on another device ID. 
• Open a console. 
• Insert DAVIX CD into your CD or DVD drive. On some Linux system the CD 
will automatically be mounted into /mnt/hdc.  
• If DAVIX CD or DVD does not mount automatically you can mount it 
manually: mount /dev/hdc /mnt/hdc 
• Create a new directory on your hard drive, e.g.: mkdir -p /tmp/mydavix 
• Copy the boot and slax directory to the newly created directory: 
cp -pvR /mnt/hdc/boot /mnt/hdc/slax /tmp/mydavix 
• Make your changes according to the instructions in the following chapters. 
75 / 111 
• Navigate to the slax directory on your hard drive using the command: 
cd /tmp/mydavix/slax 
• Execute the following command to build the ISO image: 
./make_iso.sh /tmp/mydavix/mydavix.iso 
• Either burn the created ISO image mydavix.iso to a CD-ROM/DVD or use any 
other deployment method as document in the chapter Deployment Options. 
4.3. 
Adding and Removing Modules 
After copying all the SLAX files to the hard drive you can customize the SLAX 
content. Modules can be found in following directories: 
• slax\base 
SLAX core modules. Will be loaded on every boot. 
• slax\modules Standard modules. Will be loaded on every boot. 
• slax\optional Optional modules which can be specified in the boot menu. 
You can add or remove modules from these directories as you like. 
4.4. 
Overriding Files with rootcopy 
If you just want to override a specific file in one of the modules you can use the 
slax\rootcopy directory. The content of rootcopy will be applied to the union file 
system as the last step and it allows you to override any file in the file system. 
This feature is very useful when you want to tweak single configuration files, like 
/etc/X11/xorg.conf. But for larger changes the use modules is encouraged. 
4.5. 
Modifying Boot Menu 
The boot menu can be modified through the file slax.cfg, which can be found in the 
boot directory. Here you can add or remove additional entries in the boot menu. To 
add a new one just append following section to the file: 
76 / 111 
LABEL myconf 
MENU LABEL DAVIX Graphics mode (KDE) 
KERNEL /boot/vmlinuz 
APPEND initrd=/boot/initrd.gz ramdisk_size=6666 root=/dev/ram0 rw 
changes=slax autoexec=xconf;kdm 
TEXT HELP 
                                        Help for currently selected: 
                                        Run DAVIX the max, try to 
                                        autoconfig graphics card and use 
                                        the maximum allowed resolution. 
ENDTEXT 
Due to the width limitation in this document the line with the keyword APPEND is 
wrapped to form two lines. In your slax.cfg it needs to be on one line to work 
correctly. 
The available boot options are documented in the chapter Boot Cheat Codes. 
4.6. 
Boot Cheat Codes 
SLAX comes along with many useful boot options which allow you to tweak boot and 
kernel behavior. The following list shows an extract of the most important ones. For a 
complete list check the SLAX boot parameter page13.

Creating and Modifying Modules 
This chapter shows you the different ways for getting your hands on additional SLAX 
modules for DAVIX. 
5.1. 
Leverage Existing SLAX Modules 
The easiest way to get a new SLAX module is by checking the SLAX website itself. 
The modules page offers a wide range of contributed ready to use SLAX modules14. 
These modules in general come with all the required libraries and should work right 
away. 
5.2. 
Create New Modules from Slackware Packages 
Another fast way to get additional modules is to search and download existing 
Slackware packages15 and convert them to SLAX modules using following command: 
tgz2lzm foo-bar-1.0.tgz foo-bar-1.0.lzm 
14 SLAX modules: http://www.slax.org/modules.php 
15 Search Slackware Packages: http://packages.slackware.it/ 
78 / 111 
This approach does no dependency checking and requires you to investigate the 
package dependencies yourself and convert all required packages to SLAX modules 
as well. The pragmatic approach is to convert the particular module you want to run 
and integrate it into the DAVIX ISO. Then you boot DAVIX and try to execute one of 
the binaries in your module. If there is an error that a specific library is missing then 
you have found an unsatisfied dependency. You then have to identify the Slackware 
package where the library can be found and convert it to a SLAX module. And then 
the testing starts again... 
5.3. 
Customize Existing SLAX or DAVIX Modules 
If you want to tweak a single SLAX or DAVIX package a just little. It is possible to 
extract a SLAX module using following command: 
lzm2dir foo-bar-1.0.lzm /foo/bartarget/dir 
You can then modify the extracted files to your needs and repack the directory to a 
SLAX module with following command: 
dir2lzm /foo/bartarget/dir foo-bar-1.0.lzm

6. 
Deployment Options 
The following instructions show you different ways how to install DAVIX on 
different types of media. The step-by-step guides are very generic and do also apply 
for other SLAX distributions. 
6.1. 
VMware 
DAVIX can be run inside VMware without any problems. Even OpenGL is supported.  
The procedures were successfully tested with: 
• VMware Workstation 6.0.3 Build 80004 
6.1.1. Virtual Machine Setup 
For all the described VMware deployments the following procedure is common to all: 
• Start VMware Workstation. 
• Through the Windows menu File\New...\Virtual Machine... start the New 
Virtual Machine Wizard. 
• In the Virtual machine configuration step select Custom. 
• In the Virtual machine hardware compatibility step select Workstation 6. 
• As guest operating system select Linux and select Other Linux 2.6.x kernel. 
• Choose virtual machine name and storage location. 
• Choose One as the number of processors. 
• Allocate at least 512 MB of memory. The optimal value is 1024 MB. 
• Select Use bridged networking. 
• Select I/O adapter type SCSI adapter LSI Logic. 
• Select Create a new virtual disk. 
• Select virtual disk type SCSI (Recommended). 
80 / 111 
• Choose disk size of 8 GB without allocating disk space. 
• Choose disk file name and press Finish. 
The basic virtual machine is now setup. Continue with one of the chapters CD-ROM 
based Boot or Installation on Virtual Hard Drive. 
6.1.2. CD-ROM based Boot 
Before continuing with this chapter please setup the basic virtual machine as 
described in chapter Virtual Machine Setup. 
Edit virtual machine settings: 
• Select tab Hardware 
• Select CD-ROM drive. 
• Select option Use ISO image and browse for the DAVIX image. 
• Close the settings dialog. 
On first startup the CD-ROM will not boot as default. Therefore following steps have 
to be taken: 
• Start virtual machine. 
• When the BIOS screen is shown press F2. 
• Navigate to menu Boot. 
• Move the entry CD-ROM Drive to the first position in boot order. 
• Press F10 and confirm changes by selecting Yes. 
6.1.3. Installation on Virtual Hard Drive 
Before continuing with this chapter please setup the basic virtual machine as 
described in chapter Virtual Machine Setup. 
Start the virtual machine and continue with the steps set out in chapter Hard Drive.

Our testers have reported that DAVIX works with following other virtualization 
suites: 
• Parallels 3.0 Build 5584
