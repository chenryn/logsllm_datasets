**ATT&CK ID:** T1027.005  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Indicator Removal from Tools

Adversaries may remove indicators from their malicious tools if they suspect that the tool has been detected, quarantined, or otherwise restricted by the target's defensive systems. To evade detection, they can modify the tool by eliminating the specific indicators that triggered the security alerts. The updated version of the tool, now devoid of these indicators, is then used in an attempt to bypass the target's defenses and potentially those of other targets with similar security measures.
