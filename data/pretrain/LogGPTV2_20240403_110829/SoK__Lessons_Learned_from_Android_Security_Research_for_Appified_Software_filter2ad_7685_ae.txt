IV. SYSTEMATIZATION OF RESEARCH AREAS IN APPIFIED
ECOSYSTEMS
Building on the differences between conventional and appi-
ﬁed ecosystems as well as the actor and global threat model
of the Android ecosystem, we now identify ﬁelds of research
that we think need to be systematized, considering a number
of representative research papers for each ﬁeld. We discuss
challenges in the respective ﬁelds, regarding the global actor
model, identifying the involved actors, their respective roles
in causing a speciﬁc problem and their potential in resolving
it. Referring to the global threat model, we summarize the
attacker capabilities assumed in the threat models required
to exploit the problem areas. Moreover, we present selected,
representative Android security countermeasures if available.
We do not claim that our systematization is all-encompassing,
nor that
includes all problem ﬁelds ever identiﬁed for
Android nor all countermeasures to known problems; however,
we took great care to choose a representative selection (see
Section I).

A. Permission Evolution
The concept of permission-based access control for priv-
ileged resources is one of the cornerstones of Android’s
security design and has received a lot of attention by the
security research community.
1) Challenges: We sub-categorize the identiﬁed problems
and challenges according to the most affected actors in the
ecosystem: the end users and app developers.
