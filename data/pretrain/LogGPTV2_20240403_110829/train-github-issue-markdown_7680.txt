I've set up a rudimentary server on AWS EC2 (Debian Linux) running Deno 1.9.1
with an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. It simply serves a static HTML
file when dealing with a GET request for "/", and returns a 404 for all other
requests.
It works fine for a while, and then starts hanging on all requests after a
seemingly random amount of time. The code is the following:
    import { listenAndServeTLS } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";
    const options = {
      hostname: "www.example.org",
      port: 443,
      certFile: "./keys/cert.pem",
      keyFile: "./keys/key.pem",
    };
    const index = await Deno.readTextFile("./static/index.html");
    const notFound = await Deno.readTextFile("./static/notfound.html");
    listenAndServeTLS(options, (req) =>{ 
      let statusCode, content;
      if (req.url === "/") {
        statusCode = 200;
        content = index;
      } else {
        statusCode = 404;
        content = notFound;
      }
      console.log(`${statusCode} ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
      req.respond({
        status: statusCode,
        headers: new Headers({
          "content-type": "text/html",
        }),
        body: content,
      });
    });
After the server starts hanging, curl outputs the following (and hangs as
well):
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to www.example.org (127.0.0.1) port 443 (#0)
    * ALPN, offering h2
    * ALPN, offering http/1.1
    * successfully set certificate verify locations:
    *   CAfile: /etc/ssl/cert.pem
      CApath: none
    * TLSv1.2 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):
    * Operation timed out after 300401 milliseconds with 0 out of 0 bytes received
    * Closing connection 0
    curl: (28) Operation timed out after 300401 milliseconds with 0 out of 0 bytes received
Am I doing something wrong? I'm starting a big project based on Deno and this
is blocking.
