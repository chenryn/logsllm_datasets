the responsive utilities class .vislble-* always use display: block that mess
with something display: inline-block.
for example  
i use glyphicon  to display eye open only on large desktop monitor.  
the visible-* change display: to block instead of inline-block.
please use visibility: instead that it doesn't mess with display: style.
