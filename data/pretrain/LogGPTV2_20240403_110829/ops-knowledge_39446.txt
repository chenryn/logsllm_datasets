User: Does anybody know, how GAE limit Python interpreter? For example, how they block IO operations, or URL operations. 
Shared hosting also do it in some way?
Assistant: IMO it's not a standard python, but a version specifically patched for app engine. In other words you can think more or less like an "higher level" VM that however is not emulating x86 instructions but python opcodes (if you don't know what they are try writing a small function named "foo" and the doing "import dis; dis.dis(foo)" you will see the python opcodes that the compiler produced).
By patching python you can impose to it whatever limitations you like. Of course you've however to forbid the use of user supplied C/C++ extension modules as a C/C++ module will have access to everything the process can access.
Using such a virtual environment you're able to run safely python code without the need to use a separate x86 VM for every instance.
