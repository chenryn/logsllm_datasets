### 1. Introduction
#### Who am I?

- Previously, QA automation for various web 2.0 applications
- Enjoys eating babies (jokingly)

### 2. The Basics
#### What is XMPP?
- **eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol**
- Formerly known as the Jabber project
- Specialized XML-based protocol used for:
  - Content syndication
  - File sharing
  - Instant messaging (IM)

#### Why am I picking on it?
- **Ubiquity**: Widely adopted
- **Open Standard**: RFC process
- **Implementation Flexibility**: Many details left to developers
- **XML Parsing Vulnerabilities**: Common in XML-based protocols

#### How it works
- **Decentralized Architecture**
- **Addressing via JIDs (Jabber IDs)**: `user@server`
- **Security Features**:
  - TLS encryption
  - SASL authentication
  - HTTP binding
- **XML Stream**: Data exchange format

#### Common Attributes
- **to**: Recipient JID
- **from**: Sender JID
- **id**: Optional, generated for tracking, scope of uniqueness is flexible
- **type**: Specifies the purpose of the stanza
- **xml:lang**: Affects human-readable content

#### Common Stanzas
- **Info/Query**:
  - Request info/receive response
  - Child element determines data content
  - Requester tracks by id
  - Example: `test2@akl-pc1 / acc45887`

- **Presence**:
  - Publish/subscribe model
  - Multiple recipients from one source, 'to' usually omitted
  - Used for contact status updates in IM applications
  - Example: `away`

- **Message**:
  - Similar to email
  - Example: Encrypted OTR message

### 3. The Victims
#### Clients
- **Pidgin**:
  - Formerly Gaim
  - Based on libpurple
  - 3 million users, popular default client
  - Features: File transfers, XMPP console
  - [Website](http://www.pidgin.im/)

- **Spark**:
  - Complement to Openfire server
  - Voice integration
  - No-frills client
  - [Website](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/index.jsp)

- **Gajim**:
  - GTK+ based
  - Features: File transfer, multi-protocol transports
  - [Website](http://www.gajim.org/)

- **Gtalk**:
  - Google's XMPP project
  - Features: Jingle, mobile versions, offline messaging
  - [Website](http://www.google.com/talk/)

#### Servers
- **Openfire**:
  - Formerly Wildfire
  - Popular on corporate networks
  - User-friendly, easy to configure
  - Admin web interface
  - [Website](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/)

- **JabberD14**:
  - Modular, certain features can be installed independently
  - Written in C/C++
  - Complex configuration, requires direct XML manipulation
  - Waning in popularity
  - [Website](http://jabberd.org/)

- **JabberD2**:
  - Different codebase from JabberD14
  - More RFC-compliant than the original
  - [Website](http://codex.xiaoka.com/wiki/jabberd2:start)

### 4. Attack Scenarios
#### DoS, DoS, and more DoS
- **Excessive presence traffic** leads to high overhead
- **Scalability issues** in XMPP
- **Parser errors** are often ungraceful

#### XML Parsing
- **Stanza-specific requirements**
- **Control characters** and their effects on DoS

#### File/Image Upload
- **No restrictions on file type**
- **Relatively new feature** in many clients
- **Image insertion** vulnerabilities
