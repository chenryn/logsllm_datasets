### Table 4: Human Email Responses
We characterize the human email responses we received in reply to our notifications.

- **Positive Sentiments**: 78.2%
- **Negative Sentiments**: 8.9%
- **Neutral Sentiments**: 12.9%

All replies were in response to English notifications and expressed gratitude; none requested additional information. We note that the level of feedback we received regarding DDoS notifications was commensurate with our other efforts, yet the patch response was minimal. This could indicate that operators struggle with actually resolving the issue after encountering and responding to our messages, or have become desensitized enough to DDoS issues to not take real action.

### 5.2 Anonymous Survey Responses
All of our notification messages contained a link to an anonymous seven-question survey (Appendix A), to which we received 57 submissions. We summarize the results in Table 5.

| Category                      | ICS (n=4) | IPv6 Ampl. (n=45) | Total (n=49) |
|-------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------|
| Aware of Issue                | 2/4       | 4/8                | 4/8          |
| Taken Prior Actions           | 1/4       | 20/45              | 20/45        |
| Now Taking Action             | 4/4       | 3/8                | 3/8          |
| Acceptable to Detect          | 3/4       | 5/43               | 5/43         |
| Acceptable to Notify          | 2/4       | 6/8                | 6/8          |
| Would Want Future Notifications| 2/4       | 24/43              | 24/43        |
| Correct Contact               | 1/3       | 35/45              | 35/45        |

**Table 5: Survey Responses**
- **Aware of Issue**: 54%
- **Taken Prior Actions**: 42%
- **Now Taking Action**: 62%
- **Acceptable to Detect**: 75%
- **Acceptable to Notify**: 71%
- **Would Want Future Notifications**: 71%
- **Correct Contact**: 80%

Interestingly, 46% of respondents indicated that they were aware of the vulnerability prior to notification, and 16% indicated that they had previously attempted to resolve the problem. This contrasts with the survey results in the Heartbleed study [9], where all 17 respondents indicated they were aware of the Heartbleed vulnerability and had previously attempted to resolve the problem. The widespread media attention regarding the Heartbleed bug may account for this discrepancy, highlighting the differences in the nature of various vulnerabilities.

For DDoS amplifiers and ICS vulnerabilities, the majority of respondents expressed that they were now taking corrective action (75% for DDoS amplifiers, 100% for ICS). For IPv6, only 56% of respondents indicated they would fix the problem. Given the nature of the IPv6 notification, it is likely that some of the misaligned policies were intentional.

Over 80% of respondents indicated that we reached out to the correct contact, who found scanning and notifications acceptable and requested future vulnerability notifications. However, this is a population with whom we successfully established communication. The accuracy of the other contacts from whom we did not hear back could be lower.

Our survey also allowed respondents to enter free-form comments. We received 17 IPv6 comments, 4 DDoS amplifier comments, and 1 ICS comment. Of the IPv6 respondents, 5 thanked us, 7 discussed how the misalignment could be intentional or that our detection was incorrect, 3 equated our messages to spam, and 2 noted that they initially thought our translated messages were phishing messages because they expected English messages from an institution in the United States. For amplifiers, we received four comments: two thanking us and two informing us not to notify unless there is a real attack. Finally, there was only one ICS commenter, who suggested contacting vendors instead of network operators but thanked us for our notification.

The feedback we received from these survey answers and the email responses indicates an overall positive reception of our notifications. While it may be that those who provided feedback are more opinionated, these results suggest that further discourse on notifications is needed within our community.

### 6. Discussion

#### Effective Vulnerability Notifications
Our results indicate that vulnerability notifications can improve remediation behavior, and the feedback we received from network operators was largely positive. We conclude that notifications are most effective when detailed messages are sent directly to WHOIS abuse contacts. These notifications were most effective in our experiments and resulted in an additional 11% of contacts addressing a vulnerability in response to our message.

On the one hand, this result provides clear guidance on how to best notify network operators. On the other hand, the majority of organizations did not patch their hosts despite our notifications. Even among those who patched at least one host, most did not fix all of their vulnerable hosts. In the case of networks hosting DDoS amplifiers, no form of notification generated benefits statistically significant over the control.

The failures to remediate could signal a number of problems, including:
1. Failure to contact the proper parties who could best instigate remediation.
2. A need for better education about the significance of the vulnerability.
3. A need for better education about the remediation process.
4. Administrative or logistical hurdles that proved too difficult for those parties to overcome.
5. A cost-benefit analysis by those parties that concluded remediation was not worth the effort.

Illuminating the role that each of these considerations plays, and the best steps to then address them, remains for future work.

In addition, we found the effects of our notification campaigns to be short-lived: if recipients did not act within the first couple of days, they were unlikely to ever do so. Repeat notifications did not further improve remediation levels.

Thus, while we have developed initial guidance for conducting effective notifications, there remain many unanswered questions as to how to best encourage operators to patch vulnerable hosts.

#### Improving Centralized Notification Mechanisms
We observed that relying on national and regional CERT organizations for vulnerability notifications had either a modest effect (compared to our direct notifications) or no effect (indistinguishable from our unnotified controls). While certain national CERTs evinced improved levels of remediation, others either did not act upon the information we reported, or if they did so, recipients ignored their messages. Thus, the community should consider more effective mechanisms for facilitating centralized reporting, either within the existing CERT system or using some separate organizational structure. This need is quite salient because the burden of locating and messaging thousands of individual contacts is high enough that many researchers will find it too burdensome to conduct notifications themselves.

#### Open Ethical Questions
The process of notifying parties regarding security issues raises a number of ethical questions. The community has already discussed some of these in depth, as in the debates concerning "full disclosure." Contacting individual sites suffering from vulnerabilities, likewise, raises questions regarding appropriate notification procedures.

For example, WHOIS abuse emails are a point-of-contact that multiple notification efforts have relied on [5,9,13,14,22,24]. However, these contacts are technically designated for reports of abusive, malicious behavior (a point noted in the feedback we received as detailed in Section 5). While vulnerability reports have a somewhat similar flavor, they do not serve the same purpose. It behooves the security community to establish a standardized and reliable point-of-contact for communicating security issues.

Another question concerns whether the benefits of repeated notifications for the same vulnerability outweigh the costs imposed on recipients. Some may derive no benefits from the additional messages due to having no means to effectively remediate, yet must spend time ingesting the notifications. From our results, we observed that repeat notifications did not promote further patching, which argues against performing re-notifications.

More provocative, and related to the full-disclosure debate mentioned above, is the notion of threatening recipients with publicly revealing their vulnerabilities if unaddressed after a given amount of time. Likely, the research community would find this (quite) unpalatable in general; however, one can imagine specific situations where the community might conclude that spurring vital action justifies such a harsh step, just as some have concluded regarding full disclosure.

#### Future Abuse of Notifications
In a future with widespread notifications, we would hope that security issues could be rectified more extensively and quickly. However, this would provide a new avenue for abuse, as attackers could potentially leverage the open communication channel to target network operators. As a simple example, a malicious actor could notify operators about a real security issue and inform the operators to install a malicious application to help hosts resolve the security gap. While existing techniques such as phishing detection and binary analysis can help limit these attacks, the problem domain likely will yield new challenges. It is important that the security community remain cognizant of these dangers as the state of security notifications evolves.

#### Effective Remediation Tools
For contacts that do not remediate, our measurements cannot distinguish which of the underlying reasons sketched above came into play. However, while some operators may lack sufficient motivation to take action, it seems quite plausible that others wish to, but lack the technical capabilities, resources, or permissions to do so. Accordingly, we see a need for investigation into the operational problems that operators encounter when considering or attempting remediation, as well as the development of effective and usable remediation tools that simplify the operators' tasks. By reducing the effort and resources required to address a vulnerability, such tools could also increase the likelihood that an operator would take the steps to react to vulnerability reports. Ultimately, automated systems would be ideal, but these face significant challenges, such as heterogeneous platforms, potential abusive or malicious behavior, and inadvertent disruption of mission-critical systems.

### 7. Conclusion
We have undertaken an extensive study of notifying thousands of network operators of security issues present within their networks, with the goal of illuminating which fundamental aspects of notifications have the greatest impact on efficacy. Our study investigated vulnerabilities that span a range of protocols and considerations: exposure of industrial control systems; apparent firewall omissions for IPv6-based services; and exploitation of local systems in DDoS amplification attacks.

Through controlled multivariate experiments, we studied the impact of a number of variables: choice of party to contact (WHOIS abuse contacts versus national CERTs versus US-CERT), message verbosity, hosting a website linked to in the message, and translating the message into the notified party's local language. We monitored the vulnerable systems for several weeks to determine their rate of remediation in response to changes to these variables.

We also assessed the outcome of the emailing process itself and characterized the sentiments and perspectives expressed in both the human replies and an optional anonymous survey that accompanied our notifications. The responses were largely positive, with 96% of human email responses expressing favorable or neutral sentiments.

Our findings indicate that notifications can have a significant positive effect on patching, with the best messaging regimen being directly notifying contacts with detailed information. An additional 11% of contacts addressed the security issue when notified in this fashion, compared to the control. However, we failed to prompt the majority of contacts to respond, and even when they did, remediation was often only partial. Repeat notifications did not further improve remediation. Given these positive yet unsatisfactory outcomes, we call on the security community to more deeply investigate notifications and establish standards and best practices that promote their effectiveness.
