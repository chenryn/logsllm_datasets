Table 4: Human Email Responses—We characterize
the human email responses we received in reply to our
notiﬁcations.
replies were in response to English notiﬁcations and ex-
pressed gratitude; none requested additional information.
We note that the level of feedback we received re-
garding DDoS notiﬁcations was commensurate with our
other efforts, yet the patch response was minimal. This
could indicate that operators struggle with actually re-
solving the issue after encountering and responding to
our messages, or have become desensitized enough to
DDoS issues to not take real action.
5.2 Anonymous Survey Responses
All of our notiﬁcation messages contained a link to
an anonymous seven question survey (Appendix A), to
which we received 57 submissions. We summarize the
results in Table 5.
Interestingly, 46% of respondents indicated that they
were aware of the vulnerability prior to notiﬁcation, and
16% indicated that they had previously attempted to re-
solve the problem. This contrasts with the survey re-
sults in the Heartbleed study [9], where all 17 respon-
dents indicated they were aware of the Heartbleed vul-
nerability and had previously attempted to resolve the
problem. The widespread media attention regarding the
Heartbleed bug may account for this discrepancy, high-
lighting the differences in the nature of various vulnera-
bilities.

Table 5: Survey Responses—We included a link to a
short, anonymous survey in all of our notiﬁcations. We
ﬁnd that most respondents (54%) weren’t aware of the
vulnerabilities, but found our scanning and notiﬁcations
acceptable (over 75%). Further, 62% of respondents
stated they were taking corrective actions and 71% of re-
spondents requested future notiﬁcations.
jority of respondents expressed that they were now tak-
ing corrective action (75% for DDoS ampliﬁers, 100%
for ICS). For IPv6, only 56% of respondents indicated
they would ﬁx the problem. Given the nature of the IPv6
notiﬁcation, it is likely that some of the misaligned poli-
cies were intentional.
Over 80% of respondents indicated that we reached
out to the correct contact, who found scanning and no-
tiﬁcations acceptable and requested future vulnerability
notiﬁcations. However, this is a population with whom
we successfully established communication. The accu-
racy of the other contacts from whom we did not hear
back could be lower.
Our survey also allowed respondents to enter free form
comments. We received 17 IPv6 comments, 4 DDoS am-
pliﬁer comments, and 1 ICS comment. Of the IPv6 re-
spondents, 5 thanked us, 7 discussed how the misalign-
ment could be intentional or that our detection was in-
correct, 3 equated our messages to spam, and 2 noted
that they initially thought our translated messages were
phishing messages because they expected English mes-
sages from an institution in the United States. For ampli-
ﬁers, we received four comments: two thanking us and
two informing us not to notify unless there is a real at-
tack. Finally, there was only one ICS commenter, who
suggested contacting vendors instead of network opera-
tors, but thanked us for our notiﬁcation.
The feedback we received from these survey answers
and the email responses indicates an overall positive re-
ception of our notiﬁcations. While it may be that those
who provided feedback are more opinionated, these re-
sults suggest that further discourse on notiﬁcations is
needed within our community.
6 Discussion
Here we summarize the main results developed during
our study, and the primary avenues for further work that
these suggest.
Effective Vulnerability Notiﬁcations Our results indi-
cate that vulnerability notiﬁcations can improve remedia-
tion behavior and the feedback we received from network
operators was largely positive. We conclude that notiﬁca-
tions are most effective when detailed messages are sent
directly to WHOIS abuse contacts. These notiﬁcations
were most effective in our experiments and resulted in
an additional 11% of contacts addressing a vulnerability
in response to our message.
On the one hand, this result provides clear guidance
on how to best notify network operators. On the other
hand, the majority of organizations did not patch their
hosts despite our notiﬁcations. Even among those who
patched at least one host, most did not ﬁx all of their
vulnerable hosts. In the case of networks hosting DDoS
ampliﬁers, no form of notiﬁcation generated beneﬁts sta-
tistically signiﬁcant over the control.
The failures to remediate could signal a number of
problems, including:
1. failure to contact the proper parties who could best
instigate remediation;
2. a need for better education about the signiﬁcance of
the vulnerability;
3. a need for better education about the remediation
process;
4. administrative or logistical hurdles that proved too
difﬁcult for those parties to overcome;
5. or a cost-beneﬁt analysis by those parties that con-
cluded remediation was not worth the effort.
Illuminating the role that each of these considerations
plays, and the best steps to then address them, remains
for future work.
In addition, we found the effects of our notiﬁcation
campaigns to be short-lived:
if recipients did not act
within the ﬁrst couple days, they were unlikely to ever
do so. Repeat notiﬁcations did not further improve re-
mediation levels.
Thus, while we have developed initial guidance for
conducting effective notiﬁcations, there remain many
unanswered questions as to how to best encourage op-
erators to patch vulnerable hosts.
Improving Centralized Notiﬁcation Mechanisms We
observed that relying on national and regional CERT or-
ganizations for vulnerability notiﬁcations had either a
modest effect (compared to our direct notiﬁcations) or no
effect (indistinguishable from our unnotiﬁed controls).

While certain national CERTs evinced improved levels
of remediation, others either did not act upon the infor-
mation we reported, or if they did so, recipients ignored
their messages. Thus, the community should consider
more effective mechanisms for facilitating centralized re-
porting, either within the existing CERT system, or us-
ing some separate organizational structure. This need is
quite salient because the burden of locating and messag-
ing thousands of individual contacts is high enough that
many researchers will ﬁnd it too burdensome to conduct
notiﬁcations themselves.
Open Ethical Questions The process of notifying par-
ties regarding security issues raises a number of ethical
questions. The community has already discussed some
of these in depth, as in the debates concerning “full dis-
closure.” Contacting individual sites suffering from vul-
nerabilities, likewise, raises questions regarding appro-
priate notiﬁcation procedures.
For example, WHOIS abuse emails are a point-of-
contact
that multiple notiﬁcation efforts have relied
on [5,9,13,14,22,24]. However, these contacts are tech-
nically designated for reports of abusive, malicious be-
havior (a point noted in the feedback we received as de-
tailed in Section 5). While vulnerability reports have a
somewhat similar ﬂavor, they do not serve the same pur-
pose. It behooves the security community to establish a
standardized and reliable point-of-contact for communi-
cating security issues.
Another question concerns whether the beneﬁts of re-
peated notiﬁcations for the same vulnerability outweigh
the costs imposed on recipients. Some may derive no
beneﬁts from the additional messages due to having no
means to effectively remediate, yet must spend time in-
gesting the notiﬁcations. From our results, we observed
that repeat notiﬁcations did not promote further patching,
which argues against performing re-notiﬁcations.
More provocative, and related to the full-disclosure
debate mentioned above, is the notion of threatening re-
cipients with publicly revealing their vulnerabilities if
unaddressed after a given amount of time. Likely, the
research community would ﬁnd this (quite) unpalatable
in general; however, one can imagine speciﬁc situations
where the community might conclude that spurring vi-
tal action justiﬁes such a harsh step, just as some have
concluded regarding full disclosure.
Future Abuse of Notiﬁcations
In a future with
widespread notiﬁcations, we would hope that security
issues could be rectiﬁed more extensively and quickly.
However, this would provide a new avenue for abuse, as
attackers could potentially leverage the open communi-
cation channel to target network operators. As a simple
example, a malicious actor could notify operators about
a real security issue, and inform the operators to install
a malicious application to help hosts resolve the secu-
rity gap. While existing techniques such as phishing de-
tection and binary analysis can help limit these attacks,
the problem domain likely will yield new challenges. It
is important that the security community remain cog-
nizant of these dangers as the state of security notiﬁca-
tions evolves.
Effective Remediation Tools For contacts that do not
remediate, our measurements cannot distinguish which
of the underlying reasons sketched above came into play.
However, while some operators may lack sufﬁcient mo-
tivation to take action, it seems quite plausible that others
wish to, but lack the technical capabilities, resources, or
permissions to do. Accordingly, we see a need for inves-
tigation into the operational problems that operators en-
counter when considering or attempting remediation, as
well as the development of effective and usable remedia-
tion tools that simplify the operators’ tasks. By reducing
the effort and resources required to address a vulnerabil-
ity, such tools could also increase the likelihood that an
operator would take the steps to react to vulnerability re-
ports. Ultimately, automated systems would be ideal, but
these face signiﬁcant challenges, such as heterogeneous
platforms, potential abusive or malicious behavior, and
inadvertent disruption of mission-critical systems.
7 Conclusion
We have undertaken an extensive study of notifying thou-
sands of network operators of security issues present
within their networks, with the goal of illuminating
which fundamental aspects of notiﬁcations have the
greatest impact on efﬁcacy. Our study investigated vul-
nerabilities that span a range of protocols and consider-
ations: exposure of industrial control systems; apparent
ﬁrewall omissions for IPv6-based services; and exploita-
tion of local systems in DDoS ampliﬁcation attacks.
Through controlled multivariate experiments, we stud-
ied the impact of a number of variables: choice of
party to contact (WHOIS abuse contacts versus national
CERTs versus US-CERT), message verbosity, hosting a
website linked to in the message, and translating the mes-
sage into the notiﬁed party’s local language. We moni-
tored the vulnerable systems for several weeks to deter-
mine their rate of remediation in response to changes to
these variables.
We also assessed the outcome of the emailing pro-
cess itself and characterized the sentiments and perspec-
tives expressed in both the human replies and an optional
anonymous survey that accompanied our notiﬁcations.
The responses were largely positive, with 96% of hu-
man email responses expressing favorable or neutral sen-
timents.

Our ﬁndings indicate that notiﬁcations can have a sig-
niﬁcant positive effect on patching, with the best messag-
ing regimen being directly notifying contacts with de-
tailed information. An additional 11% of contacts ad-
dressed the security issue when notiﬁed in this fashion,
compared to the control. However, we failed to prompt
the majority of contacts to respond, and even when they
did, remediation was often only partial. Repeat notiﬁ-
cations did not further improve remediation. Given these
positive yet unsatisfactory outcomes, we call on the secu-
rity community to more deeply investigate notiﬁcations
and establish standards and best practices that promote
their effectiveness.
