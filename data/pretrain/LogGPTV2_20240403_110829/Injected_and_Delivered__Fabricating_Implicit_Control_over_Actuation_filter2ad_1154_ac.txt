digital signal, and such information could be observed
and leveraged to guide the attack.
During attacks, the induced sensor output could inﬂu-
ence actuation decisions of the system instantaneously.
For instance, when positive sensor output is detected in
the X-axis of the embedded gyro, a self-balancing hu-
man transporter would apply forward accelerations to the
motor, while negative angular velocities would trigger
accelerations to the opposite direction. The amount of
the induced acceleration is related to the amount of the
spoofed angular velocity. In turn, by observing conse-

The values of θ and ¯ω can be adjusted by adopting
different amplitudes. In fact, the attacker can switch the
frequency more frequently to keep the signal at a higher
level and induce a larger heading angle. As shown in Fig-
ure 7, we conduct Switching attacks on the gyroscope of
an iPhone 7. While the phone is stationary, the collected
gyroscope data shows that it has rotated to the positive
direction of Y-axis for 6.5 rads (372.4◦) in about 25 sec-
onds. The peak angular speed ωmax is 0.45 rad/s and the
average angular speed ¯ω is 0.26 rad/s. The ratio of ¯ω
to ωmax is 0.58, which is much larger than 0.15 in the
previous experiment with Side-Swing attacks, implying
that Switching attacks are more efﬁcient than Side-Swing
attacks and could be used to achieve a larger heading
angle. However, acoustic frequencies used in Switch-
ing attacks should satisfy (8) and (15). We can assume
F2 = F1 + step (F1  0
and F should be decreased to get closer to n0FS. In this
way, attackers could adjust F more effectively since they
could infer the sign of ε and know whether the adjusted
F is getting closer to or further away from n0FS.
After synchronizing to a frequency F with |ε| less than
0.5 or 1, attackers could start Side-Swing attacks. For
Switching attacks, if attackers ﬁnd a suitable F1 with
−1 < ε1 < 0, they could ﬁnd F2 by F2 = F1 + 1. Sim-
ilarly, they could also acquire F1 = F2 − 1 if they ﬁnd
a suitable F2 with 0 < ε2 < 1. Usually, we make both
|ε1| and |ε2| close to 0.5 so that n0FS is well bounded by
[F1,F2].
In our settings, this process involves manually tuning
the acoustic frequency with an off-the-shelve function
generator and observing consequent actuations of the tar-
get device. Usually, such interactions between attackers
and the target system could take about 10 to 60 seconds.
3) Manipulating. In Side-Swing attacks, attackers can
increase the amplitude when the induced actuation is in
the target direction and otherwise decrease the ampli-
tude. In Switching attacks, attackers can switch the fre-
quency of acoustic signals when the induced actuation or
acceleration in the target direction begins to attenuate.
4) Adjusting (optional). After several minutes of ma-
nipulation, n0FS could deviate from F because of sample
rate drifts. Attackers could accommodate the deviation
by observing changes in ε and adjusting F. For exam-

method. Attackers could reversely infer the current di-
rection and amount of the induced sensor output by ob-
serving the consequent actuations or accelerations.
quent actuations or accelerations in the system, attackers
could estimate the current direction and amount of the
induced sensor output, as illustrated in Figure 8. An-
other property that could be observed and estimated is
the frequency (|ε|) of the induced signal, which could
be reversely mapped from the frequency of oscillating
movements induced in actuation systems. Such oscillat-
ing movements could be periodic accelerations and de-
celerations of a motor, shaking or circling movements of
visual information in VR/AR systems, etc.
The reversely inferring method could be used in fol-
lowing steps to guide the attack:
1) Proﬁling. Before the attack, attackers could analyze
the behavior of an identical device under acoustic effects
to ﬁnd the resonant frequency range and proﬁle suitable
attack frequencies of the embedded inertial sensor.
To ﬁnd the resonant frequency range, attackers could
generate single-tone sound and sweep a frequency range
at an interval of 10 Hz. Attackers apply the sound to a
device that is stationary or in a well-balanced status, and
there is no other input to control or interfere with the tar-
get system. The range of sound frequencies that notice-
ably affect the motion sensing unit and induce actuations
in the device can be recorded as the resonant frequency
range. We notice that acoustic frequencies in the middle
part of the range could affect the target device more sig-
niﬁcantly since they are closer to the natural frequency.
Attackers could then generate single-tone sound in the
resonant frequency range and adjust the frequency with
an interval of 1 Hz or smaller to ﬁnd and proﬁle attack
frequencies. Acoustic frequencies used in our attacks are
usually close to the integer multiple of the sensor’s sam-
ple rate and we have F = n0 · FS + ε (|ε| < 1,n0 ∈ Z+),
where n0FS is an integer multiple of FS that is in the res-
onant frequency range of the sensor. Attackers could ob-
serve the induced actuations and estimate |ε|. In our set-
tings, when |ε| < 1, the corresponding acoustic frequen-
cies (F) can be considered as suitable attack frequencies.
In practice, due to sample rate drifts, n0FS could ﬂuc-
tuate in a range. As a result, there could be a range of
possible attack frequencies. Since we want to use fre-
quencies near n0FS, by tracking the range of n0FS, the

ple, if attackers observe that ε < 0 and |ε| increases, they
could infer that n0FS has increased and could increase F
to compensate for the deviation.
6.2 Experimental Setup
In our experiments, we use several types of consumer-
grade tweeter speakers, including two electromagnetic
(EM) speakers [20, 21] and one piezo speaker [17]. We
measure the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) of the speakers
with an NI USB-4431 sound measuring instrument and a
GRAS 46AM free-ﬁeld microphone that has a wide fre-
quency range. The speaker plays single-tone sound from
1.5 kHz to 31.5 kHz with an interval of 100 Hz. We set
the sample rate of the microphone to 96 kHz instead of
48 kHz to pick up ultrasonic signals correctly.
Figure 9 shows the average SPL values of the speak-
ers, from which we can select a speaker that has the max-
imum SPL for each attack. The SPL of our sound source
can be represented by max(SPLem1,SPLem2,SPLpiezo).
By selecting from multiple speakers, we avoid sharp per-
formance degradations of one speciﬁc speaker in certain
frequency bands and enhance the overall performance of
the sound source. The resulting improvement of SPL
can be crucial in attacks on embedded sensors since the
actual sound pressure grows exponentially as the sound
level increases; a gain of 6.02 dB in SPL doubles the
amount of sound pressure. During attacks, we use a di-
rectivity horn, such as [16] and [19], to improve the di-
rectivity of the sound source. The speaker is powered
by a 50-Watt Lepy LP-2051 audio ampliﬁer and the sig-
nal source is an Agilent 33220A function generator. We
conduct the experiments indoor and put acoustic foams
in the environment to reduce potential sound reﬂections.
In Table 1 and Table 2, we measure the maximum hor-
izontal distance DMax between the sound source and the
target device that an observable actuation or an inertial
output with an amplitude of 0.1 rad/s can be induced
under acoustic effects. Empirically, the possible attack
distance with our sound source is about DMax

adversarial control. Manufacturer information of inertial
sensors is collected for statistical purposes. We ﬁnd sen-
sor information of iPhones and VR devices in online dis-
assembling reports [15]. Android devices provide APIs
to retrieve sensor information. We disassemble other de-
vices to reveal the information written on the package of
the embedded inertial sensor, but some devices do not
specify the sensor model explicitly even on the sensor’s
package. Lastly, we record the alignments of affected
and functional axes based on the orientation of the sen-
sor when the embedded inertial sensing module is rec-
ognized. Otherwise, the alignments of axes are based on
the orientation of the device.
6.3 Experiments on Closed-loop Systems
In a closed-loop control system, there is usually a goal
state. The system continuously compares the goal state
with its current state based on inertial measurements and
tries to diminish the difference between them through ac-
tuations. We evaluate our attacks on different instances
of four types of closed-loop systems, including self-
balancing human transporters, robots, stabilizers, and
anti-tremor devices. These systems present different fea-
tures under acoustic effects. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that a
large part of them are susceptible to implicit control.
(1) Human transporters. The goal state of self-balancing
human transporters is a vertical position of the system
with a tilt angle of 0◦. Inertial sensors are used to de-
tect tilts of the transporter. Based on the direction and
amount of the tilt, the control system applies accelera-
tions to motors to correct the position of the system.
We evaluate acoustic attacks on four instances of self-
balancing transporters: a Megawheels TW01 scooter, a
Veeko 102 scooter, a Segway one S1 unicycle, and a
Segway Minilite scooter. We ﬁnd that, by spooﬁng the
angular speed measured by gyros, the moving direction
and speed of the motor could be controlled, as illustrated
in Figure 10.
Results. The Megawheels scooter and the Veeko scooter
are vulnerable to adversarial control over the moving di-
rection and speed of the motor through ultrasonic signals.

While the Segway One S1 unicycle can be manipulated
by Switching attacks, the range of induced actuations is
very small. The unicycle only tilts slightly to the tar-
get direction. The Segway Minilite scooter tends to lose
control under acoustic effects. Our Side-Swing attacks
and Switching attacks on smart human transporters are
demonstrated in [6] and [11]1. The transporter is in a rel-
atively static experimental setting, and we lift the wheels
of the transporter up from the ground during the experi-
ments.
(2) Robots. Self-balancing robots work similarly to self-
balancing human transporters but without a rider. We test
two self-balancing robots equipped with MEMS gyros
and accelerometers: a Mitu robot and a MiP robot.
Results. We ﬁnd that the gyro of Mitu robot is suscepti-
ble to adversarial control. The robot would speed up to
the same direction as the spoofed rotations under Side-
Swing attacks, as demonstrated in [5]. While the gyro
of MiP robot is not affected by acoustic attacks, its ac-
celerometer is vulnerable to DoS attack, which makes it
