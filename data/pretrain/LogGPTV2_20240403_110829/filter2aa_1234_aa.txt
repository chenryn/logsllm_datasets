## Substitution Cipher – Puzzle
### SEND + MORE = MONEY
- **Step-by-Step Solution:**
  1. S + M = MO, so M = 1
  2. S + 1 = 1O, so O = 0
  3. S + 1 = 10, so S = 9
  4. N + R = 1E, E + 1 = N, so R = 8
  5. Since E+1 = N, and N + 8 > 11, E can be 3, 4, or 5.
  6. If E=3 or 4, reach dead end; thus E=5
  7. If E=5, then N=6
  8. Only remaining values are D=7, Y=2
- **Solution:**
  - 9567
  - + 1085
  - 10652
