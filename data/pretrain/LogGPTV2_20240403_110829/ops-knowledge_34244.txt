User: I am launching the text editor but for different users the default text editor could be different, so how do I get the name of which text editor is being used just to handle if an error occur switch to different text editor ?
Assistant: Given you're working in a Linux/POSIX environment you could read the EDITOR environment variable using the os.environ map.
