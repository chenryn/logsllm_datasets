User: I want to know if Google App Engine support using google.appengine.api.quota package to get bandwidth usage, not cpu usage?
If so, how to get with Python or Java and print in webpage?
Assistant: No, but you can get a very close estimate of this by adding up the length of the request headers and body for incoming requests, and the response body and headers for responses.
