What actually happens?
We can see code like this
       @Override
        public void create(String path, boolean ephemeral) {
            if (!ephemeral) {
                if (checkExists(path)) {
                    return;
                }
            }
            int i = path.lastIndexOf('/');
            if (i > 0) {
                create(path.substring(0, i), false);
            }
            if (ephemeral) {
                createEphemeral(path);
            } else {
                createPersistent(path);
            }
        }
You can see recursive here.  
If we have a lot of dubbo reference or service.  
This method would execute too many times and cost a large time.  
In fact , if dubbo group is same then the path may no need to check every time
