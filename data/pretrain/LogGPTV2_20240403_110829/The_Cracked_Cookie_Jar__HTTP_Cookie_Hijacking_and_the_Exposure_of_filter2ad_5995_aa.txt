**Abstract:**
The increasing demand for online privacy, driven by high-profile session hijacking attacks, has led to a greater deployment of HTTPS. However, many websites still avoid full encryption due to performance or compatibility issues. A common approach is to enforce encryption for critical functionalities and sensitive data while allowing less critical operations over HTTP. This partial deployment can lead to vulnerabilities that expose private information.

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of major websites to assess the exposure of functionality and information to attackers who have hijacked HTTP cookies. We find that service personalization often results in the unintended exposure of private data. Our study reveals several severe flaws: attackers can obtain users' home and work addresses from Google, Bing, and Baidu; complete search histories from Bing and Baidu; and contact lists and email capabilities from Yahoo. E-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay expose purchase histories, and almost all websites expose users' names and email addresses. Ad networks like DoubleClick can reveal visited pages.

To evaluate the practicality and extent of these attacks, we examine multiple aspects of the online ecosystem, including mobile apps, browser security mechanisms, and search bars. We conducted IRB-approved measurements on a subset of our university's public wireless network for 30 days, detecting over 282,000 accounts exposing the necessary cookies for hijacking. While tools like the EFF's HTTPS Everywhere extension can reduce the attack surface, HTTP cookies remain exposed, posing a significant threat, especially to Tor users.

**I. Introduction**

As more of our daily activities move online, ensuring the privacy of digital communications has become crucial. The publicity surrounding tools like Firesheep, which demonstrated how easily sessions can be hijacked, has accelerated the adoption of HTTPS for critical user activities. However, many major websites still serve content over unencrypted connections, exposing HTTP cookies to potential eavesdroppers.

While access control policies should separate privileges for authenticated (session) and non-authenticated (persistent tracking) cookies, this is often not the case in practice. Websites frequently assign privileges to HTTP cookies to enhance user experience, but this can compromise security. Although session hijacking has been well-studied, the privacy risks associated with non-session cookie hijacking have received less attention.

Previous studies have highlighted the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) in unencrypted traffic, but they are limited in scope. Modern websites are dynamic, and information can be fetched in obfuscated forms and constructed client-side at runtime. Additionally, certain pieces of information may only be exposed under specific actions, making them difficult to detect through passive monitoring.

In this paper, we explore the privacy implications of partially adopting encrypted connections. We audit 25 major services across various categories, analyzing the use of HTTP cookies and the combinations required to expose different types of information and functionality. Our findings demonstrate that HTTP cookie hijacking not only exposes private information but also allows unauthorized access to protected account functionalities.

We conducted an IRB-approved measurement study on a subset of our university's public wireless network, detecting over 8,000 unique accounts per day exposing their cookies. We also examined the impact of HSTS, browser extensions, and mobile apps, finding that partial HSTS deployment and unencrypted connections in subdomains still leave users vulnerable.

Furthermore, we investigate the risk of deanonymizing Tor users through HTTP cookie hijacking. Our study suggests that a significant portion of Tor users may be vulnerable to such attacks.

**II. Background, Threat Model, and Motivation**

**A. Browser Security Mechanisms**

Modern browsers support various security mechanisms, including HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), which can prevent HTTP cookie hijacking. HSTS instructs browsers to initiate communication over HTTPS, and major browsers use a preloaded list to proactively connect to domains over HTTPS. Another mechanism is certificate pinning, which prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by specifying a set of trusted certificate hashes.

**B. Threat Model**

HTTP cookie hijacking can occur through passive eavesdropping on public wireless networks. An attacker monitors the traffic, extracts HTTP cookies, and uses them to access personalized information and account functionalities. These attacks require the user to have previously logged into the service. Active adversaries can use more invasive techniques, such as injecting content to force the browser to send requests to vulnerable sites or exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.

**C. Motivation - Network Traffic Study**

To understand the feasibility of cookie hijacking, we conducted a 30-day study on the traffic passing through our university's public wireless network. We collected data using a logging module, capturing outgoing traffic to TCP ports 80 and 443. Our analysis revealed that a significant number of users are exposed to cookie hijacking, even when using popular security tools.

**III. Analysis of Cookie Hijacking Attacks**

We audited 25 major services, identifying the cookies required for different types of information and functionality. Our findings show that HTTP cookie hijacking can expose a wide range of private information and protected account functionalities. The diversity of affected websites suggests a systemic risk rather than a threat to a specific class of sites.

**IV. Collateral Exposure of User Cookies**

We examined the collateral exposure of user cookies through mobile apps, browser components, and search bars. Our analysis shows that these components can significantly increase the risk of cookie hijacking, even when users employ security measures.

**V. Deanonymization Risk for Tor Users**

We explored how HTTP cookie hijacking can be used to deanonymize Tor users. Our study found that 75% of outgoing connections from a new exit node are over HTTP, suggesting that a large number of Tor users may be vulnerable to deanonymization through cookie hijacking.

**VI. Countermeasures**

We discuss general countermeasures against HTTP cookie hijacking, including the importance of ubiquitous encryption, proper access control, and the use of security tools. We also disclosed our findings to the audited services and the Tor community to help protect users from this significant privacy threat.

**VII. Ethical Considerations**

We address the ethical aspects of our research, including the IRB approval process and the steps taken to ensure the privacy and security of the data collected.

**VIII. Related Work**

We review related work on session hijacking, PII exposure, and the limitations of previous studies. Our work provides a more comprehensive analysis of the privacy implications of partial HTTPS adoption.

**IX. Conclusion**

Our study highlights the widespread and severe privacy risks associated with partial HTTPS adoption. We call on developers to fully enforce HTTPS and on users to be aware of the limitations of current security measures. By addressing these issues, we can better protect online privacy and security.
