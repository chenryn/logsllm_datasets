### Issue: Hadoop 2.5.0 Installation on Ubuntu 12.04 Cluster

**Summary:**
I am installing Hadoop 2.5.0 on a 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 cluster. After following the installation instructions, I ran the `jps` command on the master node and did not see the NameNode in the output. Upon checking the Hadoop logs, I found a `BindException` indicating that port 9000 is already in use.

**Diagnosis:**
- **Port Conflict:** The `netstat` command confirmed that Python is listening on port 9000.
- **Process Identification:** The process ID (PID) for the Python instance was identified as 2346.
- **Process Details:**
  - `ps -p 2346`:
    ```
    PID TTY    TIME CMD
    2346 ? 01:28:13 python
    ```
  - `ps -lp 2346`:
    ```
    F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
    4 S     0  2346     1  0  80   0 - 332027 poll_s ?       01:28:30 python
    ```
  - `ps -Cp 2346`:
    ```
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    2346 ?        Ssl   88:34 /usr/lib/cmf/agent/build/env/bin/python /usr/lib/cmf/agent/src/cmf/agent.py --package_dir /usr/lib/cmf
    ```

**Root Cause:**
A failed Cloudera Hadoop distribution installation has left Python 2.7 running on port 9000. This is conflicting with the Hadoop NameNode, which also requires port 9000.

**Resolution:**
1. **Uninstall Python 2.7:**
   - I uninstalled Python 2.7 and replaced it with Python 3.2.
   
2. **Verify Hadoop Installation:**
   - After uninstalling Python 2.7, I re-ran the `jps` command on the Hadoop master node.
   - The `jps` command now returns the expected results, including the NameNode.

**Conclusion:**
The issue has been resolved by removing the conflicting Python 2.7 installation. The Hadoop NameNode is now running correctly on port 9000.
