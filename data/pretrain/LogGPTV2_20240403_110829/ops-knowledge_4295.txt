User: I am installing Hadoop 2.5.0 on a Ubuntu 12.04 cluster, 64-bit. At the end of the instructions I type $ jps on the master node and do not get a NameNode. I checked the Hadoop logs and found:

BindException error stating :9000 is already in use.

$ netstat -a -t --numeric-ports -p | grep :9000 returns that python is listening on this port. It appears I need to move python 2.7 to another port. How do I move python?
Followed the command below, the pid=2346.

$ ps -p 2346
PID TTY    TIME CMD
2346 ? 01:28:13 python

Tried second command:

$ ps -lp 2346
F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
4 S     0  2346     1  0  80   0 - 332027 poll_s ?       01:28:30 python

more detail:

$ ps -Cp 2346
PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
2346 ?        Ssl   88:34 /usr/lib/cmf/agent/build/env/bin/python /usr/lib/cmf/agent/src/cmf/agent.py --package_dir /usr/lib/cmf

It appears a failed Cloudera Hadoop distribution installation has not been removed. It installed python 2.7 automatically. Not sure what else is automatically running. Will attempt to uninstall python 2.7.
Assistant: It appears Cloudera installed python 2.7. This was removed / replace with python 3.2.
The $jps command on Hadoop now returns the expected results including NameNode.
