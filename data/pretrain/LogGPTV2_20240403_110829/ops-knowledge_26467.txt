User: How do you monitor your application in real-time as it runs so you can spot and fix potential problems?
Assistant: The following methods can be used to monitor the running status of the application program in real time: 1. Log monitoring: add the log function to the application program, and output key information to the log file. By monitoring the log file, potential problems can be found and solved in time. 2. Health check: Add health check functions to the application, such as HTTP interface or heartbeat detection, and monitor the health check information to understand the running status of the application. 3. Performance monitoring: use performance monitoring tools to monitor the CPU, memory, network and other indicators of the application program, find performance problems in time and optimize them. 4. Abnormal monitoring: Use the abnormal monitoring tool to capture and analyze the abnormal information of the application, and find and repair the bugs in the application in time. 5. Code quality monitoring: monitor and optimize code quality through code static analysis tools, code refactoring tools, etc., to improve the reliability and maintainability of applications. In short, real-time monitoring of the running status of an application can help developers discover potential problems and solve them in time, so as to improve the reliability and stability of the application.
