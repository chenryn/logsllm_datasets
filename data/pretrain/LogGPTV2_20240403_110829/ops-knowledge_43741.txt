User: The predominant ORMs that run in a linux-based environment seem to be written around a specific language.
Microsoft LINQ, however, supports access from a number of languages.  Can I do this in linux-land (i.e. non-LINQ-land, non-JVM-land), for example between native versions of Python and Ruby?
Assistant: This question doesn't really make sense. Presumably LINQ, like any .NET library, can be used in any language that runs in the CLR: C#, VB, IronPython, IronRuby, etc.
The most common cross-language runtime that works on Linux is the Java VM, and you can use Java libraries - including ORMs like JDO - in any language that uses that VM: Java, Scala, Clojure, Jython, JRuby, etc.
