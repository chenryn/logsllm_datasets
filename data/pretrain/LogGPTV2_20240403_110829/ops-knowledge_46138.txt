User: Please give the concept of "four-layer wall" for security protection, and explain its function and realization method.
Assistant: The concept of "four walls" is a comprehensive application of the following aspects. The first layer of wall: Firewall (Firewall) Function: Prevent network attackers from invading the intranet through the Internet, and limit network communication flow. Implementation method: By setting network access policies, control and manage the traffic entering and exiting the network, and cut off malicious attacks. The second wall: Intrusion Detection System (Intrusion Detection System, IDS) Function: Detect network attacks, discover and report security incidents. Implementation method: Collect information such as network communication and host activity, analyze and compare, and send an alarm or intercept after a threat is found. The third wall: Network Security Management System (NSMS) Function: To conduct comprehensive supervision and management of network security to prevent illegal operations and abuse of authority. Implementation method: Classify and manage network resources, determine user access rights and permission sets, and record corresponding logs. The fourth wall: The function of data encryption technology: Protect data privacy and confidentiality, and ensure that data is not stolen or tampered with during network transmission and storage. Implementation method: Use various encryption algorithms to encrypt data to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
