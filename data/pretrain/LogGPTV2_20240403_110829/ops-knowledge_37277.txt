[5.9,7.0,5.9,8.5,8.3,8.7,9.9,10.3,6.3,10.9,7.3,6.2,4.3,4.2,3.8,-0.5,0.1,0.5,1.6,-0.6,0.6,-1.0,1.8,5.0,4.4,4.7,7.4,10.5,8.5,9.7,10.8,10.1,8.5,8.8,6.6,6.4,4.4,3.8,0.9,1.8,-0.3,-1.7,-1.2,-1.8,0.7,2.2,5.1,4.7,6.4,7.2,9.4,11.1,9.9,12.7,10.6,9.5,10.5,8.0,6.2,4.0]
Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Stationary
B: Sparse
C: Unable to determine
D: Periodic

Assistant: Answer: D
