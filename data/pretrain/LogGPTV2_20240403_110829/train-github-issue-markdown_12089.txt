**Issue Observed on Linux/AMD64 with `0b9866f`**

During a test, I encountered the following issue only once. The test script is as follows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Compile the test binary
go test -c

# Enable exit on error and print commands
set -xe

# Infinite loop to run the test
while true; do
    # Set GOMAXPROCS to a random value between 1 and 128
    GOMAXPROCS=$((1 + RANDOM % 128))
    
    # Run the test with verbose output and without short tests
    ./net.test -test.v=true -test.short=false -test.run=TestVariousDeadlines || exit 255
done
```
