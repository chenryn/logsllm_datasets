A number of users have asked how they can load type information from the
export data section of a .a file produced by the Go compiler. Although you can
use the standard go/importer package to find (relative to $GOPATH) and load a
.a file, it provides no way to load a file that lives elsewhere. In contrast,
the old API separated the operations of FindPkg and Import.
The new package should provide these features too, as users are currently
forced to fork either the deprecated x/tools package or the standard
go/internal/gcimporter package.
