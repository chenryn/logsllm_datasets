**Current behavior**  
A routed component cannot use a relative path to navigate to another
component; whether from the primary changing the named router outlet, or from
a named router changing the primary.  
The issue is written up here.  
The closest routerLink syntax to navigating to a new named router outlet
component is:  
`Details`  
However, when a routed component is already in the aux named route, this
routerLink produces an extra set of parenthesis.
> auth/portfolio/(home/1//aux:details)(aux:details)
If a routed component isn't already in the aux named route, then the url
generated is malformed anyway.
> auth/portfolio/(home/1)(aux:details)
**Expected behavior**  
I would expect to be able to change to another route via a routerLink like the
documentation says, regardless of the depth I am in the URL tree.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
We have an application where the named router outlet is used to display lists
of entities. Upon selecting an entity, the application replaces the primary
router outlet with the details of the entity. Entity details control which
lists are available, so navigation occurs in the primary router outlet to
change which component is showing in the named router outlet.
