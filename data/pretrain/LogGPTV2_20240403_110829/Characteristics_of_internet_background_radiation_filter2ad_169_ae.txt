### Network Communication and Malware Analysis

#### Reverse Shell Mechanism
The malware establishes a reverse shell connection back to the source host, often referred to as "phoning home." The port on the source host is chosen randomly and embedded in the shell code sent to the victim. For example, the Welchia worm uses a reverse shell, although its random port selection mechanism is flawed. This makes it challenging to capture the contents of follow-up connections because:
1. We need to understand the shell code to determine the "phone-home" port.
2. Initiating connections from our honeypots violates the policies of the hosting networks.

#### UDP Port 53: DNS Traffic
We expected to see a significant amount of DNS requests, but instead, we observed sources sending non-DNS or malformed packets. An example packet is shown below:

```
20:27:43.866952 172.147.151.249.domain > 128.3.x.x.domain: [udp sum ok]
258 [b2&3=0x7] [16323a] [53638q] [9748n] [259au]
Type26904 (Class 13568)? [|domain] (ttl 115, id 12429, len 58)
0x0000
0x0010
0x0020
0x0030
(...)
xxxx xxxx 0035 0035 0026 xxxx 0102 0007

8862 3500 cb1f ee02 3500
................
..?.&....bi.5..L
.b5.....5.
```

These packets dominate the UDP traffic observed in the LBL and UW (I, II) networks. Table 8 summarizes the DNS activity observed in the Class A network over a 24-hour period, showing a more diverse range of activities. Malformed DNS requests are the most common, but other query types are also substantial. These queries may be due to misconfigured DNS server IP addresses on hosts, as they are sent to various destination IP addresses and originate from different networks.

**Table 8: Summary of DNS Activity in the Class A Network (24 Hours)**

| Type | Num Packets | Num Sources |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Malformed Packets | 5755 | 1485 |
| Standard (A) Queries | 10139 | 3616 |
| Standard Query (SOA) | 4059 | 150 |
| Standard Query (PTR) | 1281 | 95 |
| DNS Standard Query SRV | 785 | 27 |
| DNS Standard Query AAAA | 55 | 20 |
| DNS Standard Unused | 739 | 16 |
| DNS Standard Unknown | 1485 | 3 |

#### UDP Port 137: NetBIOS Name Queries
Activity on this port is dominated by standard NetBIOS name queries (probes).

#### UDP Ports 1026, 1027: Windows Messenger Pop-Up Spam
These ports receive UDP packets with source port 53 and destination port 1026 or 1027. While this port combination typically indicates a DNS reply, the packet contents reveal DCE/RPC requests exploiting a weakness in the Windows Messenger API to deliver spam messages to unpatched Windows desktops. The source IP addresses are often spoofed, as indicated by the observed ICMP host-unreachable backscatter. The use of source port 53 is likely an attempt to evade firewalls.

**Example Packet:**

```

#### UDP Port 1434: Slammer Worm
The Slammer worm remains active and is the only background radiation observed on port 1434.

#### TCP Port 1433: MS-SQL Login Attempts
Most source hosts attempt to log in with blank passwords. We have not yet developed a detailed responder for MS-SQL.

#### TCP Port 5000: Universal Plug-and-Play
This port is reserved for Universal Plug-and-Play on Windows systems, but most of the observed requests are not valid HTTP requests. Many requests contain consecutive 0x90 bytes (NOP), suggesting buffer-overrun exploits.

### Temporal Distribution of Activities

#### Dominant Exploits
Figure 11 shows the number of source hosts over 18 days for the four exploits with the largest source populations. The SrchAAA and Locator exploits show relatively stable and close volumes, likely originating from the same worm. The Exploit1464 and Sasser exploits exhibit more dynamic source volume changes, especially Exploit1464, which saw a significant reduction around April 30th. All four exploits show a strong diurnal pattern with peaks at local noon, possibly due to hosts being turned on during the day.

#### DCE/RPC Exploits
DCE/RPC exploits targeting the Microsoft DCOM RPC vulnerability present an interesting case. We observed multiple payload lengths, but this diversity is not due to intentional polymorphism. Instead, it appears to be due to different code bases. Clustering by payload length and port, we identified over 30 different exploit types. Strong temporal correlations were observed among exploits of the same length, particularly for lengths 2792 and 2904.

### Characteristics of Source Hosts

#### Across Ports
Analyzing activities across multiple ports provides a better understanding of a source's goals. For example, observing a follow-up to port 4444 with "tftp msblast.exe" after an RPC exploit indicates that the earlier exploit was from Blaster.

**Table 9: Summary of Top Multi-Port Scanning Episodes**

| Name | Ports | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| NB-1 | 139, 445 | Commonly scanned by viruses exploiting NetBIOS/SMB (CIFS). |
| DCE-1 | 135, 139, 445 | Likely variants of Welchia. |
| Agobot-1 | Various | Targets SAMR pipe through CIFS, drops mdms.exe into startup folders. |

#### Spatial Variance
Comparing data from different networks, such as the two UW /19 networks, reveals consistent patterns in multi-port profiles, as shown in Figure 12.

This analysis helps in understanding the behavior and evolution of malware and provides insights for developing effective classification schemes to filter out background radiation traffic.
