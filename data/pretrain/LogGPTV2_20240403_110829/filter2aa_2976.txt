Resident Aliens
(really quickly)
Resident Aliens
 Generally - aliens treated the same 
under the U.S. Constitution as 
Citizens
 Wong Wing v. U.S. (U.S. 1896) -
Established that an an alien subject 
to criminal proceedings is entitled 
to the same constitutional 
protections available to citizens
 Rasul v. Bush (U.S. 2004) - Degree of 
control over Gitmo is sufficient to 
trigger habeas corpus rights
Resident Aliens
 Wong Wing v. U.S. (U.S. 1896) - The 
contention that persons within the 
territorial jurisdiction of this 
republic might be beyond the 
protection of the law was heard 
with pain on the argument at the bar -
- in face of the great constitutional 
amendment which declares that no 
state shall deny to any person 
within its jurisdiction the equal 
protection of the laws.
Resident Aliens
 Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (U.S. 2004) - "a 
state of war is not a blank 
check for the President when it 
comes to the rights of the 
Nation's citizens."

Not real SkyDog actions, I hope. only using his name.

 SkyDog has just attended 
Outerz0ne „09 and decides to 
tell his friends, all 2 of them, 
how amazing it was.
 He calls, writes a letter to, and 
emails his friend Wrench (in 
Nashville) and Bush (in Iraq)…

Private Search
 After Outerz0ne „09, SkyDog 
returns to Nashville only to find 
he‟s been evicted and his laptop was 
stolen by some Asshats.
 One of the Asshats turned on the 
laptop, found all of SkyDog‟s 
Hacker Consortium files, freaked 
out, and called the police.  The 
police have Scott Moulton run 
EnCase on Sky‟s machine…
Private Search
 U.S. v. Runyan (5th, 2002)  
 Examining part of a system does 
not open all parts
 U.S. v. Crist (M. Dist. Pa, 2008)
 Using EnCase to hash files is a 
„search‟ 
Private Search
 SkyDog gets back his laptop from 
the police and boots up Windows 
Millennium. The machine is hacked 
into by a Turkish citizen on the hunt 
for terrorist hackers.  
 After finding SkyDog‟s Hacker 
Consortium documents, the man 
quickly reports SkyDog to the FBI…
Private Search
 Unknownuser Cases
 U.S. v. Steiger (11th Cir. 2003)
 U.S. v. Jarrett (E.D. Va, 2002)
 Private Search Factors
 Government encouraged/initiated 
the search; or aware/acquiesced 
to the search? 
 And did the private actor intend to 
help law enforcement?
Border Crossing
 SkyDog is stressed out and takes a 
vacation to Mexico and engages in 
some serious drinking. While 
returning, he has a feeling is going 
to be searched and not being quite in 
his right mind, SkyDog swallows his 
cellphone.  He also attempts to 
„hide‟ his laptop but is unable to fit it 
...
 SkyDog was selected for a search…
What this might look like
Border Crossing
 U.S. v Arnold (9th Cir, 2007) -
Laptops no different from closed 
containers which are subject to 
suspicionless searches
 Routine
 Allowed by fact that you‟re 
crossing the border
 Non-Routine Searches
 Requires reasonable suspicion
Border Crossing
 While searching his laptop the 
officers find a drive named „My 
Illegal Files‟ and proceed to 
open a document containing 
what appears to be a listing of 
credit card numbers.  They 
confiscate the laptop but upon 
turning it back on they find the 
drive has been encrypted…
Border Crossing
 In Re Boucher (M.D. Vt, 2008) -
Encryption keys are products of the 
mind and are not subject to 
disclosure under the 5th amendment
 In Re Boucher (M.D. Vt, 2009) - Wait, 
never mind it was a foregone 
conclusion.
 The vault code v. key to a lock 
debate
Border Crossing
 Because of the heavy drinking 
SkyDog‟s eyes are red, his skin is 
pale (more so than usual), and 
he has the shakes…
Strip Search
 Non-Routine, so it requires more.
 Usually part of an inventory search, 
so not „criminal‟ in nature
 Recent Cases (non-border)
 Subjecting a 13 year old student to a 
strip search unreasonable when looking 
for IB Profin 800mg.
 Subjecting a female motorist to a strip 
search after arrest for a misdemeanor 
marijuana possession, unreasonable.  
Especially, while it watched by male 
officers over the closed circuit t.v. 
system.
Border Crossing
 During the strip-search, the 
examining officer noticed a lump 
in SkyDogs throat…
Bodily Intrusion
 Non-Routine
 A lot of crossover with the other 
amendments 
 May require a warrant depending on 
the level of urgency required, even 
at the border
 Let‟s just say SkyDog would be sore 
in the morning… 
Arrested
 Because of all the odd behavior 
and suspicious actions SkyDog 
is arrested on suspicion of 
Smuggling --something.  During 
the booking SkyDog‟s Phone 
Rings…
Answering Cellphone
 U.S. v. De La Paz (S.D. NY, 1999) -
Agents had probable cause to 
believe that a cell phone, a 
common tool in the drug trade, 
would provide further evidence. 
Due to the temporal nature of a 
phone call, it was not 
unreasonable for police to 
answer the call.                
The beat down
 After some investigation SkyDog is 
released. He returns home to his 
neighbor being beaten by a masked 
man who runs through his house. 
Police arrive and SkyDog consents 
to a search of his house.
 the police notice a „Stolen Credit 
Cards‟ folder on his desktop.  They 
begin search through his computer…
The beat down
 U.S. v. Turner (1st Cir, 1999) - Even 
though consent to a search was 
given, the consent did not extend 
beyond evidence of the assault.  The 
initial evidence, however, would be 
available under plain view exception.  
Military Invasion
 It turns out that the „Stolen Credit 
Cards‟ folder was actually just his 
al & tigger porno, all 25 tbs, so he is 
released again. 
 Unfortunately, those 
emails/letters SkyDog sent to Bush 
looked like terrorist documents.  
The President orders a raid, by the 
military, of both SkyDog‟s and 
Bush‟s houses… 
SkyDog Porn Sample
Military Invasion
 Bush Memo (2003) - "... our Office 
recently concluded that the Fourth 
Amendment had no application to 
domestic military operations”
 In Re: Terrorist Bombings (2nd Cir, 
2009) - “The Fourth Amendment‟s 
requirement of reasonableness —
but not the Warrant Clause — applies 
to extraterritorial searches and 
seizures of U.S. citizens”
So what can I do about it?
 Don‟t keep sensitive data, memorize 
everything and eat the evidence
 Only travel with „clean‟ equipment
 Format, download data over secured channels 
upon arrival
 Encrypt Liberally
 Never physically store the key
 Ideally have a physical / non-physical key
 Shutdown equipment long before crossing
 Use bios passwords
 Never travel with something you can‟t 
afford to lose.
Miscellaneous. Recent 
Cases
 Herring v. U.S. (U.S., 2009) - Exclusionary 
rule does not apply “when police mistakes 
are the result of negligence such as that 
described here.”
 State v. Stephenson (Minn. App, 2009) -
Defendant excluded from home by court 
order had no reasonable expectation of 
privacy.
 Wisconsin v. Sveum (Wi. App, 2009) -
Warrantless GPS tracking OK.
 People v. Weaver (Ny., 2009) - Warrantless 
GPS tracking not OK.
