User: Please describe what is a Docker container? How are they different from virtual machines, and what application scenarios are they suitable for?
Assistant: Docker container is a lightweight virtualization technology that isolates application environments and dependencies through virtualization at the operating system level, allowing applications to run in different environments. Unlike virtual machines, Docker containers are virtualized at the operating system level and contain only the minimum operating system and applications required to run applications, so the startup time and resource footprint are much smaller than virtual machines. In addition, the Docker container can share the operating system and resources of the host, so that multiple containers can share the CPU, memory, network and other resources of the host. Docker containers are suitable for scenarios that require rapid deployment, elastic scaling, and efficient resource utilization. Container technology can be used in various application scenarios such as web applications, microservices, databases, and distributed systems. Virtual machines are suitable for application scenarios that require complete isolation, such as applications that require high security and applications that need to run different operating systems. The virtual machine can realize the isolation of physical hardware, and can provide a complete operating system and resources for each virtual machine, but the startup time and resource usage are relatively large.
