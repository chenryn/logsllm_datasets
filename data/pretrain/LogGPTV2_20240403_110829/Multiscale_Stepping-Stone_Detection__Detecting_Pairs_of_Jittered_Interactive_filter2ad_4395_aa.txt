## Abstract
Computer attackers often use compromised hosts as stepping stones to obscure the origin of their attacks. There is a growing body of literature on detecting such stepping stones by monitoring interactive connections into and out of a site. Early work focused on content comparisons, but recent methods rely on timing information to detect encrypted connections.

This paper addresses the challenge of intruders modifying their traffic to evade detection. We introduce the concept of "maximum delay tolerance" and show that there are theoretical limits to the effectiveness of such evasion tactics for sufficiently long connections. We consider two types of evasions: local jittering of packet arrival times and the addition of superfluous packets (chaff). Using wavelets and multiscale methods, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate short-term behavior, where jittering or chaff masks correlation, from long-term behavior, where correlation remains. Our results suggest that there are effective countermeasures against these evasion tactics for long-lived interactive connections.

## 1. Introduction
Attackers launching network intrusions over the Internet often use stepping stones to evade surveillance. This technique involves using a series of compromised hosts as relay machines, constructing a chain of interactive connections using protocols like Telnet or SSH. The commands typed by the attacker are passed through the chain, making it difficult to trace the true origin of the attack.

To locate the perpetrator, investigators must execute a complex traceback procedure, working back host by host. An alternative approach is to install a stepping-stone monitor at the network access point of an organization. The monitor analyzes properties of both incoming and outgoing traffic to detect correlations that suggest the presence of a stepping stone.

This paper focuses on interactive connections, which are of particular interest because many tasks require human interaction. Attackers aware of the risk of monitors can modify their traffic to evade detection. We consider evasions based on local timing perturbations and the addition of chaff packets. We assume a maximum tolerable delay for the attacker, and our analysis shows that for sufficiently long connections, these evasion techniques can be defeated using multiscale methods.

## 2. Previous Approaches
Staniford and Heberlein (1995) [7] initiated the literature on stepping-stone detection by analyzing character frequencies in Telnet connections. Zhang and Paxson (2000) [8] developed an activity-based approach for SSH connections, focusing on the "on–off" structure of interactive sessions. Yoda and Etoh (2000) [11] used timing properties to compare connections, but their methods are vulnerable to timing perturbations by attackers.

## 3. Next Generation Evasions
Existing approaches to detecting stepping stones are subject to evasions. Attackers can transform streams to alter the relays, making it difficult to detect correlations. For example, filters can be used to add chaff to the stream, disrupting the sequencing and volume relationships between incoming and outgoing connections.

The challenge for the next generation of stepping-stone monitors is to detect correlated activity between two streams when one or both streams may be transformed and content cannot be examined for correlations.

## 4. The Constraint Hypothesis
Our research hypothesizes that certain constraints on interactive sessions can prevent effective transformations. These constraints include:

- **Latency Constraints:** Interactive connections are tied to a human user, who will find long delays annoying and error-prone. We posit a maximum tolerable delay.
- **Representative Traffic:** Human typing and think-time pauses exhibit statistical regularities in interpacket spacings, which are distinct from machine-driven communication. Interpacket spacings above 200 msec follow a Pareto distribution with shape parameter α ≈ 1.0 [9].

These constraints imply that the original stream and its transformation must be synchronized within a specific maximum delay, and the interarrival times must follow the same distribution as the universal Pareto distribution.

We consider conservative transforms that do not add chaff, only altering the interarrival times to mask similarity. We examine possible evasion transforms that conform to these assumptions, such as re-randomizing interarrival times. However, such transforms lead to complete desynchronization over time, violating the maximum tolerable delay constraint.

**Figure 2. Divergence of Independent Streams.** The two cumulative counting functions diverge arbitrarily as time progresses.

## 5. Partial Randomization of Keystroke Arrival Times
We propose a local jittering algorithm called dyadic block reshufling. This approach creates a second stream with arrival times that never differ from the first stream by more than a specific amount, but are independent at fine levels. The algorithm operates at a specific medium scale, ensuring that the two streams remain synchronized while masking short-term correlations.

**Figure 3. Dyadic Block Reshuffling.** Illustration of the algorithm operating at a specific medium scale.

In summary, our results suggest that attackers relying solely on local timing jitter or chaff packets are unlikely to evade detection for long-lived interactive connections. More sophisticated schemes, such as steganographic methods, may be required, but these are harder to implement and use.
