### Manual Activation of Teredo and 6to4 on Different Operating Systems

- **Teredo and 6to4 Usage**: Manually fully-enabled Teredo on Windows or other operating systems accounts for approximately 0.1–0.2% of all connections.

### Trends in IPv6 Adoption

- **Native IPv6**: The usage of native IPv6 peaked during the week of IPv6 Day, followed by a slight decrease, and has since remained relatively stable, with a possible minor upward trend.
- **6to4**: The percentage of 6to4 connections has decreased slightly over time.
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Usage**: On weekends, there are significantly fewer connections from hosts using native IPv6, but more from those using 6to4. This pattern reverses during the weekdays, suggesting higher native IPv6 usage in workplaces.

### Dual-Stack Preferences

- **Native IPv6 Preference**: Figure 11 shows that 90–100% of connections from hosts with native IPv6 prefer IPv6 in dual-stack configurations. However, this preference has decreased over time, likely due to the increased use of "happy eyeballs," which quickly fails over from IPv6 to IPv4 (see Section 5.6).
- **6to4 and Teredo Preferences**: Only 0.5–1% of 6to4 connections and well under 0.1% of Teredo connections preferred IPv6 in dual-stack (Teredo is omitted in Figure 11).

### IPv6 Tunneling Protocols

- **6to4 Protocol**: Uses the prefix 2002::/16.
- **Teredo Protocol**: Uses the prefix 2001:0::/32 [1, 2].
- **Other Tunneling Technologies**: Older IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling technologies are not common and thus are ignored [5, 13].

### Operating System IPv6 Capabilities

- **Windows**: Over 6% of connections were from IPv6-capable Windows clients, but only 20% of these (with native IPv6) actually preferred to use IPv6 in dual-stack.
- **MacOS X and Linux**: These OSs had a similar 6–7% of IPv6-capable connections, with most being native IPv6 and preferring IPv6 in dual-stack.
- **iOS**: Only 1–2% of connections came from IPv6-capable iOS clients, but about 30–40% (with native IPv6) preferred IPv6 in dual-stack.
- **Linux Spike**: There was a significant increase in IPv6-capability for Linux around IPv6 Day 2011, largely due to Ubuntu clients enabling IPv6 via point-to-point tunnels. This spike was even higher in raw data, as multiple participating web sites were monitored by a company using Ubuntu-based probes. These probes were filtered out as they were not genuine clients.

### Windows Versions and IPv6

- **Windows XP**: Only 1% of connections from Windows XP hosts were IPv6-capable, with a similarly low percentage of IPv6-forced connections (6to4 and Teredo are not enabled by default).
- **Windows Vista and 7**: Both versions had about 10% of IPv6-capable connections, but the percentage of IPv6-forced was 20% higher for Windows 7 (6to4 and Teredo are enabled by default, but the lower IPv6-forced percentage suggests Teredo was often disabled or failed to establish a tunnel on Vista [32]).

### Client Sample Dependencies

- **JS-tests vs. FA-tests**: JS-tests showed a higher proportion of IPv6-forced connections due to a higher proportion of Windows users. IPv6-capable percentages were similar, but the difference between weekday and weekend usage was larger in FA-tests. MacOS X and Linux, which strongly preferred IPv6, were less represented in FA-tests.

### Country IPv6 Capabilities

- **Top-12 Countries**: Analyzed the proportions of IPv6-capable and IPv6-preferred connections for the top-12 countries. The number of Teredo connections did not vary much, so it was omitted for brevity.
- **FA-test Results**: Focused on FA-tests as JS-tests were more biased due to the participating web sites.

### Dual-Stack Failures

- **Estimating Failures**: Cannot reliably differentiate between IPv6-related dual-stack failures and other connectivity issues, but an upper bound can be estimated.
- **Happy Eyeballs**: This technique allows browsers/OSs to minimize fail-over delays by quickly failing over to IPv4 if IPv6 connections cannot be established. Observed happy eyeballs for 10–20% of hosts with native IPv6, with the percentage increasing over time.

### Related Work

- **Research Studies**: Various studies have examined IPv6 deployment, including routing, DNS data, and active measurements. Recent web-based methods, such as Steffann’s approach, have provided insights into IPv6 capabilities and preferences across different client types and regions.

This revised text aims to provide a clear, coherent, and professional overview of the IPv6 adoption trends, preferences, and related research.
