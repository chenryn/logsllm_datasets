### Abstract
The global telephone network is a critical infrastructure relied upon by billions daily. Central to its operation is the Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol, which manages call setup, mobility, and other network services. Originally designed under the assumption that only trusted parties would access its core, SS7 allows any party with core access to redirect and intercept calls globally. Increased interconnectivity has led to a rise in illicit call redirection attacks. We introduce Sonar, a system that detects SS7 redirection attacks by measuring call audio round-trip times (RTT) between telephony devices. These attacks increase the physical distance traveled by calls, leading to longer RTTs. We design and implement a distance-bounding protocol to securely measure RTT and use custom hardware deployed across the United States to characterize the impact of distance on RTT. Our model, tested with a redirection testbed, shows that Sonar can detect 70.9% of redirected calls with low false positive rates (0.3%). Ethical SS7 redirection attacks conducted with an industry partner demonstrate that Sonar detects 100% of such attacks in real networks without false positives.

## 1. Introduction
Telephony systems are the most ubiquitous and trusted communication infrastructure globally, providing reliable audio connections for personal, business, and highly sensitive communications. The Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol, which facilitates translations between cellular networks, was built on the assumption of implicit trust. However, deregulation and increased access have made SS7 vulnerable to redirection attacks, where calls are maliciously rerouted to intercept and eavesdrop. We develop Sonar, a mechanism that detects SS7 redirection attacks by measuring the increased audio latency caused by these attacks. Sonar uses a distance-bounding-inspired protocol to estimate the round-trip time (RTT) over a multi-hop network, allowing users to be aware of potential malicious redirections.

### Contributions
- **Acoustic Distance Bounding:** We design and implement a protocol called Rapid Audio Exchange (RAE), which uses audio tones to implement a challenge-response protocol, operating in a multihop adversarial telephony network.
- **Distance vs. RTT Time:** We characterize the relationship between distance and RTT in telephony networks using custom hardware deployed at ten locations across the United States.
- **Attack Detection Capabilities:** We emulate SS7 redirection attacks and show that Sonar has a 70.9% true positive rate (0.3% FP) for calls with varying attacker proximity and a 97.0% true positive rate (0.3% FP) for U.S. calls redirected outside North/Central America.
- **Real Attack Validation:** We validate our testbed by conducting legal SS7 attacks with an industry partner, demonstrating that Sonar can detect 100% of such attacks with no false positives.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Signaling System 7 (SS7)
The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connects various technologies, including landline, cellular, and VoIP, using different protocols. SS7, a suite of protocols, provides call signaling, mobility management, and other network features. It forms an all-digital communications network for signaling between telephone switches and core network entities. SS7 does not carry call content but only signaling information. Despite its importance, SS7 lacks mechanisms for message authentication or authorization, making it vulnerable to attacks.

### 2.2 SS7 Security Vulnerabilities
SS7's primary security flaw is the lack of message authentication, allowing any participant to send messages on behalf of another network entity. This enables tracking and controlling the flow of calls and text messages. Some carriers attempt to block malicious messages, but many do not. Solutions exist but require carrier cooperation, which is often lacking. Our solution, Sonar, can be implemented by users without carrier involvement.

### 2.3 SS7 Redirection Attacks
Redirection attacks exploit SS7 vulnerabilities to route calls to an attacker, who can then forward or intercept the call. These attacks are stealthy and increasingly common. They involve spoofing call forwarding requests or modifying dialed numbers to ones controlled by the attacker.

### 2.4 The Role of Convergence
The openness of the SS7 network, combined with limited controls, makes several legitimate network functions susceptible to abuse. These attacks are difficult to detect and are becoming more frequent.

## 3. Hypothesis
We hypothesize that SS7 redirection attacks increase the physical distance traveled by call audio, leading to longer RTTs. By measuring this increased latency, we can detect such attacks.

## 4. Threat Model
Our threat model assumes that attackers can inject SS7 messages to redirect calls. The endpoints are honest, but the network is adversarial. We aim to detect these attacks by measuring the RTT of call audio.

## 5. Acoustic Distance Bounding Protocol
We design the Rapid Audio Exchange (RAE) protocol, which uses a series of audio tones to implement a challenge-response protocol. RAE operates in a multihop telephony network, estimating the RTT between two endpoints.

## 6. Experimental Setup
We deploy custom hardware at ten locations across the United States to measure RTT. We also build a testbed to emulate SS7 redirection attacks and validate our model.

## 7. Results
Our experiments show that Sonar can detect 70.9% of redirected calls with a 0.3% false positive rate. For U.S. calls redirected outside North/Central America, the detection rate is 97.0% with a 0.3% false positive rate. Real-world SS7 attacks conducted with an industry partner confirm that Sonar can detect 100% of such attacks with no false positives.

## 8. Additional Concerns
We discuss additional concerns related to Sonar, including potential countermeasures and future work.

## 9. Execution of Actual SS7 Rerouting Attacks
We detail the execution of actual SS7 rerouting attacks and compare the results with our simulations, validating the effectiveness of Sonar.

## 10. Related Work
We review related work on SS7 security and distance bounding techniques, highlighting the unique contributions of Sonar.

## 11. Conclusion
Sonar provides a practical solution for detecting SS7 redirection attacks by measuring call audio RTT. Our experiments and real-world tests demonstrate its effectiveness, offering a reliable way for users to protect the integrity of their calls.
