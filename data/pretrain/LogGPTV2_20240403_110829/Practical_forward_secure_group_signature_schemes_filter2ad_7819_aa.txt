## Abstract
Group signature schemes enable a group member to sign messages anonymously on behalf of the group, while allowing a designated entity to reveal the signer's identity in case of a dispute. These schemes are fundamental for various security applications, such as electronic banking and voting systems. Two critical issues—forward security and efficient revocation—have not been adequately addressed in prior schemes. We introduce the first forward-secure group signature schemes, which, in addition to satisfying all the security properties of previous schemes, provide a new desired property: forward security. This ensures that the compromise of a group signing key for the current time period does not allow an attacker to forge signatures from past periods. Forward security is crucial for mitigating damage from key exposure, especially in large groups where the risk of key exposure increases. Our schemes are provably secure in the random oracle model under the strong RSA and decisional Diffie-Hellman assumptions. Additionally, we extend our scheme to handle group member exclusion without re-keying other members, ensuring that excluded members cannot generate valid signatures while maintaining the anonymity of their past signatures.

## 1. Introduction
Group signature schemes are essential for many security applications. Unlike ordinary signature schemes, which have a single signer, group signature schemes allow any member of a group to sign documents on behalf of the group. The group manager controls membership and issues signing keys, ensuring that only group members can sign. Group signatures provide anonymity and unlinkability, meaning anyone can verify the signature but only the group manager can identify the signer. This makes them suitable for applications like electronic voting and auctions, where hiding organizational structure is important.

### 1.1 Exposure of Group Signing Keys and Forward-Secure Group Signatures
The exposure of secret keys, due to storage system compromises or human errors, is a significant threat to cryptographic protocols. In group signature schemes, if a group member's signing key is exposed, an attacker can sign documents on behalf of the group. Prior schemes require changing the group public key and signing keys, invalidating all previously obtained signatures. We propose using forward security to mitigate this issue. In a forward-secure scheme, signing keys evolve over time, and the exposure of a key at a given time does not affect the validity of past signatures. We divide the lifetime of the group public key into T periods, and each period has a unique signing key derived from the previous one using a one-way function. This ensures that even if a key is compromised, past signatures remain valid.

### 1.2 Retroactively Publicly Revocable Group Membership with Backward Unlinkability
Practical group signature schemes must support dynamic membership. Previous schemes efficiently handle member joins but struggle with exclusions. If a member's key is stolen, it should be possible to revoke future signatures while preserving the anonymity of past ones. We call this retroactive public revocability. Additionally, signatures generated before the key was compromised should remain valid and anonymous, a property we term backward unlinkability. Our approach extends forward-secure group signatures to support both properties, ensuring that the size of signatures remains independent of the number of revoked members.

### 1.3 Our Contribution and Outline
We present two forward-secure group signature schemes based on the Ateniese et al. scheme. The first scheme leverages techniques from [6], and the second uses a new method proposed in [24]. Both schemes are efficient and independent of the number of group members and time periods. They also support flexible time-limited group membership. Furthermore, we extend these schemes to support retroactive public revocability and backward unlinkability, with signature sizes independent of the number of revoked members.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the model and formal security requirements. Section 3 covers preliminaries and notations. Sections 4 and 5 describe our forward-secure group signature schemes and their extensions. Section 7 concludes the paper, and the appendix provides security proofs for the lemmas.
