ABSTRACT
A group signature scheme allows a group member to sign
messages anonymously on behalf of the group, while in case
of a dispute, a designated entity can reveal the identity of a
signature’s originator. Group signature schemes can be used
as a basic building block for many security applications such
as electronic banking systems and electronic voting. Two
important issues – forward security and eﬃcient revocation
– have not been addressed by prior schemes. We construct
the ﬁrst forward-secure group signature schemes. While sat-
isfying all the security properties proposed in previous group
signature schemes, our schemes provide a new desired secu-
rity property, forward-security: while the group public key
stays ﬁxed, a group signing key of a group member evolves
over time such that compromise of a group signing key of
the current time period does not enable an attacker to forge
group signatures pertaining to the past time periods. Such
forward-security is important to mitigate the damage caused
by key exposure and particularly desirable for group signa-
ture schemes because the risk of signing key exposure esca-
lates as the size of the group increases. Our schemes are
provably secure in the random oracle model and under the
strong RSA and decisional Diﬃe Hellman assumptions.
Furthermore, we extend our forward-secure group signa-
ture scheme to provide a solution for the problem of group
member exclusion without the need to re-key all other group
members. When a group member is excluded, he should
not be able to generate valid signatures any more and yet

INTRODUCTION
Group signature schemes are an important building block
for many security applications. In contrast to ordinary sig-
nature schemes where there is only one signer, group signa-
ture schemes allow any member of a group of signers to sign
documents on behalf of the group. In general, a group man-
ager controls the group membership and issues group sign-
ing keys to group members. The group signing keys allow
a group member to sign documents on behalf of the group.
In particular, a group signature scheme provides anonymity
and unlinkability to the signer, i.e. everybody can verify
that the signature is valid on behalf of a group, but no-
body except for the group manager can identify the signing
member. Furthermore it is computationally hard for any-
body but the group manager to decide whether two diﬀerent
valid signatures were generated by the same group member.
These attractive security properties make group signature
schemes appealing to applications such as electronic voting,
electronic auctions and many applications where it is de-
sirable to hide organizational structure. Group signature
schemes are also used in electronic cash systems to conceal
the cash-issuing banks’ identities [27] and identity escrow
systems [25].
The concept of group signatures was ﬁrst proposed by
Chaum and van Heyst [16]. Several diﬀerent group signa-
ture schemes have been proposed [16, 18, 13, 11, 27, 12,
3]. The most recent scheme by Ateniese et al. is particu-
larly eﬃcient and provably secure [3]. Unfortunately several
limitations still render all previous solutions unsatisfactory
in practice. One important problem is how to deal with
exposure of group signing keys. Another important prob-
lem is how to allow eﬃcient exclusion of group members.
We discuss these two problems in more detail in the rest of
this section and introduce our approaches to address these
problems.
1.1 Exposure of Group Signing Keys and For-
ward Secure Group Signatures
Exposure of secret keys for “non-cryptographic” reasons,
such as a compromise of the underlying storage system or
human errors, is one of the greatest threats to many crypto-
graphic protocols in practice. In group signature schemes,
if a group member’s group signing key is exposed to an at-
225tacker, the attacker can then sign any documents on behalf
of the group. And the danger of the exposure of signing keys
escalates as the group size increases. In prior group signa-
ture schemes, the exposure of one group member’s group
signing key not only requires changing the group public
key and signing keys, but also renders all previously ob-
tained group signatures invalid, because one cannot distin-
guish whether a signature is generated by an attacker after
it obtained the group signing key or by the legitimate group
member before the attacker obtained the group signing key.
We propose to use the concept of forward security to re-
duce the damage of exposure of a group signing key, i.e.
even when a group signing key is exposed, previously gen-
erated group signatures remain valid and do not need to be
re-signed. In a forward secure group signature scheme, the
group signing keys evolve over time. We divide the time
that a group public key is desired to be valid into T periods.
Assume the group public key is GPK, and a group mem-
ber A obtained an initial group signing key SK0 when he
initially joins the group. While the group public key stays
ﬁxed, A’s group signing key evolves over time: in time pe-
riod i, A’s group signing key evolves from SKi−1 to SKi
using a public one-way function. After time period i, SKi
is erased from the system. And a signature on a message m
is a pair (cid:2)i, s(cid:3) where i represents the time period indicated
in the signature. The veriﬁcation procedure ensures that a
signature (cid:2)i, s(cid:3) is valid for message m only if s was produced
using the group signing key for time period i.
Here is an example to illustrate how such a forward-secure
group signature scheme can reduce the damage of the expo-
sure of a group signing key. Assume an attacker breaks into
a group member’s system in time period j and obtains the
member’s group signing key SKj. Because of the one-way
property, the attacker cannot compute the group signing
keys corresponding to previous time periods. Assume a user
B obtained a group signature on a document m prior to
time period j. B expects to be able to use the signed docu-
ment m for a long time (long after time period j). When it
is discovered that SKj has been exposed, the group public
key is revoked.
If the group signature scheme were with-
out the forward-secure property, obviously the group signa-
ture B obtained on document m would be rendered invalid
and B would need to obtain a new signature on document
m. But when the group signature scheme is constructed
as a forward-secure scheme, the attacker cannot compute
the group signing keys corresponding to previous time peri-
ods, and hence the group only revokes the group public key
for any period following the time period j. Thus any valid
signatures with corresponding time period before j is still
accepted. Because in the signature B obtained (cid:2)t, s(cid:3), t < j.
Hence the signature (cid:2)t, s(cid:3) is still a valid signature on m and
B would not need to obtain a new signature on m.
The concept of forward secure signatures was ﬁrst pro-
posed by Ross Anderson [2] for traditional (non-group) sig-
natures. The challenge is to design an eﬃcient scheme. In
particular the size of the secret key, public key and signa-
tures should not be dependent on the number of time peri-
ods during the lifetime of the public key. Several schemes
have recently been proposed for traditional (non-group) sig-
natures and threshold signatures that satisfy this eﬃciency
property [6, 1, 26, 28, 24].
Previous group signature schemes do not provide forward
security. We propose the ﬁrst forward secure group signa-
ture schemes. In particular we extend the group signature
scheme proposed by Ateniese et al. [3] in two diﬀerent ways
to construct two diﬀerent forward secure group signature
schemes. The ﬁrst scheme leverages techniques used in [6]
and the second scheme employs a new technique to achieve
forward security which is also proposed in [24]. In addition,
we show that forward secure group signature schemes en-
ables other desirable security properties at little extra cost.
For example, when a new group member C joins, with for-
ward secure group signature schemes, we can restrict the
new member to generate signatures that are only valid for
future time periods and not before his joining period with
no extra overhead. More generally, we can support at little
extra cost the property of time-limited group membership,
i.e. a group member is only allowed to sign on behalf of the
group during a limited time.
1.2 Retroactively Publicly Revokable Group
Membership with Backward Unlinkabil-
ity
Any practical group signature scheme must support dy-
namic group membership. In practice, group members may
join, leave, or be excluded from the group during at any
time. Previous group signature schemes can support group
member joins eﬃciently, but not group member exclusion
events. Imagine the scenario where an attacker stole a group
member A’s group signing key during time period i. The
leakage of A’s group signing key is only discovered later in
time period j. The group manager revokes A’s group sign-
ing key in time period j. Therefore nobody should be able
to generate group signatures valid for time periods after j
using A’s group signing key. We call this property pub-
lic revokability. Furthermore, because the attacker could
have signed documents on behalf of the group any time af-
ter time period i using A’s group signing key, signatures
generated using A’s group signing key after time period i
should become invalid. At the same time, signatures gen-
erated using other members’ group signing keys should still
remain valid and anonymous and unlinkable. We call this
property retroactive public revokability. Note that retroac-
tive public revokability implies public revokability, not vice
versa. Moreover, signatures generated using A’s group sign-
ing key before time period i should remain valid, anonymous
and unlinkable because these signatures are generated by A
not the attacker. We call this property backward unlinkabil-
ity. Ideally a group signature scheme should support both
retroactive public revokability and backward unlinkability.
A naive approach to achieve both public revokability and
backward unlinkability is to use a forward secure group sig-
nature scheme and re-issue a new group public key and new
group signing keys to legitimate group members whenever
a new group member is expelled. Obviously this approach
does not support retroactive public revokability and is im-
practical when the group is large or highly dynamic.
In
another approach the group manager issues a Certiﬁcation
Revocation List (CRL) when a group member is expelled.
When a user obtains a group signature on a document for
time period i, he checks against the CRL to see whether
the signer has been expelled for time period i. The chal-
lenge for this approach is to design such a group signature
scheme that enables CRL and still provides anonymity, un-
linkability and backward unlinkability. Ateniese and Tsudik
mentioned similar problems as open issues for group signa-
2
226ture schemes [4]. Bresson and Stern [10] proposed a ﬁrst
solution providing public revokability for the group signa-
ture scheme in [13]. Unfortunately their approach does not
provide retroactive public revokability and the signature size
is linear to the number of revoked members. We extend our
forward secure group signature schemes to provide the ﬁrst
solutions that support both retroactive public revokability
and backward unlinkability and the signature size in our
schemes is independent of the number of revoked members.
1.3 Our Contribution and Outline
We propose forward-secure group signature schemes. In
particular we extend the group signature scheme proposed
by Ateniese et al. [3] in two diﬀerent ways to construct
two diﬀerent forward secure group signature schemes. The
ﬁrst scheme leverages techniques used in [6] and the sec-
ond scheme employs a new technique to achieve forward
security and is also proposed in [24]. Our schemes satisfy
forward security as well as all the traditional security prop-
erties shared with previous group signature schemes. Our
schemes are eﬃcient in the sense that they are independent
of the number of group members, and the size of signatures
and group keys are independent of the number of time pe-
riods during the lifetime of the group public key. As a side
beneﬁt, our schemes can also be extended to support ﬂexible
time-limited group membership at little extra overhead.
Furthermore, we extend our forward-secure group signa-
ture schemes to support revocation. Our approaches are the
ﬁrst ones that support retroactive public revokable group
membership with backward unlinkability and the signature
size in our approach is independent of the number of revoked
members.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst
introduce the model and formal security requirements in
section 2, and the preliminaries and our notations in sec-
tion 3. We then describe our forward secure group signature
Scheme I and extensions in section 4 and the Scheme II in
section 5. We conclude in section 7 and give security proofs
the lemmas in the appendix.
