##### Description of the problem
To reproduce this issue
  * Create PlaneGeometry
  * Upload any non-power of 2 texture eg 1600 x 1200
When mipmaping is disabled:  
material.map.minFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;  
material.map.magFilter = THREE.LinearFilter;  
texture is displayed properly.
When mipmapping is enabled (default) , looking close up (first mipmap) is
looks ok, with angel, distance texture looks wrong, mipmaps are scaled,
stretched.
Textures 1024 x 1024 are working properly.
As far as we can see problem occurs only on Windows 7 64bit and Chrome. In
Internet Explorer works fine.  
Tested in latest version of Three.js editor r85 but issue is present in other
versions (tested r77).
Disabled mipmaps
