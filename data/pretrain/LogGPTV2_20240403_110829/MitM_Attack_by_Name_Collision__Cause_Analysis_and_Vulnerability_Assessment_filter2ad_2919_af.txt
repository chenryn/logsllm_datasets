the WPAD name collision attack can be set up at any time
outside of the new gTLD registries’ control. Fortunately, our
results show that even though some new gTLDs’ attack surface
domains in victim ASes have already been fully-registered, the
overall registration has just started, and most HVDs are still
under new gTLD registries’ control.
Finding 7. For majority of the new gTLDs that have
not been fully registered yet, the attack window is open-

TABLE VII: Effectiveness and deploy number estimation for
remediation strategy at new gTLD registry, victim AS, and end

effectiveness using current dataset.
in conﬂict with the original goal of providing more registration
choices, and also hurts new gTLD registries’ revenue model.
ICANN now changes the policy to allowing their registrations
after a 90-day “controlled interruption” period instead of
blocking them forever [3].
According to our attack surface characterization, for most
of the new gTLDs, relatively few SLD are highly vulnerable
to the WPAD name collision attack and need scrutinized
registration. For example, for .network, 96% of its domains
in NXD trafﬁc have very low volume and/or low persistence
of WPAD queries. This is why a general-purpose block list
is counterproductive, as opposed to per-SLD and per-TLD
analysis performed in this paper. Thus, the attack surface
deﬁned and quantiﬁed in this paper offers a cost-effective
way of deploying new gTLD registry level domain registration
scrutinization. With the attack surface quantiﬁcation results
for all victim ASes, we take the union of the attack surface
domains, and ﬁnd that in total 494 new gTLDs among the 738
ones delegated before 2015/08/25 have HVDs. If all of them
have registration scrutinization, 97.4% of the global leaked
WPAD queries in our dataset can be protected. Consistent with
our ﬁndings in §VI, most of the new gTLDs have only very few
HVDs which need protection – among the 494 new gTLDs,
302 (61.3%) of them have less than 10 HVDs. Thus, for
majority of new gTLD registries, this defense can be deployed
with very little sacriﬁce of the business revenue while still
being highly effective.
Considering that having all 494 new gTLD registries agree-
ing on the deployment may be difﬁcult in practice, we also
evaluate the effectiveness of a partial deployment. In this
analysis, we rank the 494 new gTLDs by the protected
leaked WPAD query percentages if they deploy scrutinized
registration of HVDs, and the CDF is shown in Fig. 15. As
shown, deployment at only the top 18 (3.6%) new gTLDs can
already protect 80% of the leaked WPAD query globally. Thus,
in the deployment, a more feasible and also very effective
strategy is to start with the most important 20–40 new gTLDs.
Victim AS level remediation. As shown in §IV, majority
of the leaked WPAD queries come from a few home access
network ASes. In addition to new gTLD registry level defense,
