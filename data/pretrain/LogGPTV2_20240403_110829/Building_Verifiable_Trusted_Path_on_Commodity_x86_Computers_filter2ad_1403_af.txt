### ARM TrustZone and Virtualization Support

Recent advancements in ARM's TrustZone security extensions [1] and virtualization support [62] have made it feasible to apply our trusted-path design to ARM-based I/O architectures [63]. TrustZone Security Extensions [1] enable a single physical processor to safely and efficiently execute code in two separate environments: a more-privileged secure world and a normal world. System designers can leverage multiple hardware primitives, such as TrustZone-aware memory management units, DMA and interrupt controllers, and peripheral bus controllers, to partition critical system resources and peripheral devices between these worlds.

Additionally, with the upcoming virtualization support [62], it will be possible to run a hypervisor in a special mode within the normal world. This hypervisor can optionally intercept any calls from the normal worldâ€™s guest OS to the secure world. Future work includes porting our trusted-path system to the ARM architecture and supporting a wide range of applications on mobile and embedded platforms.

### Conclusion

Building a general-purpose trusted path mechanism for commodity computers with a significant level of assurance requires substantial systems engineering, which has not been fully achieved by previous work. Specifically, this requires:
1. Effective countermeasures against I/O attacks enabled by inadequate I/O architectures and potentially compromised operating systems.
2. Small trusted codebases that can be integrated with commodity operating systems.

The design presented in this paper demonstrates that, in principle, a trusted path can be achieved on commodity computers. It also suggests that simple I/O architecture changes could significantly simplify the design of trusted paths.
