SNRs across the trials.
before, we also test Wi-Vi in a second building in our university
campus, where the walls are different. In particular, we experiment
with 4 types of building materials: 8!! concrete wall, 6!! hollow wall
supported by steel frames with sheet rock on top, 1.75!! solid wood
door, and tinted glass. In addition, we perform experiments in free
space with no obstruction between Wi-Vi and the subject.
In each experiment, the subject is asked to stand 3 meters away
from the wall (or Wi-Vi itself in the case of no obstruction) and per-
form the ‘0’ bit gesture described above. For each type of building
material, we perform 8 experiments.
Fig. 12 shows Wi-Vi’s performance across different building ma-
terials. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 12(a) shows the detection rate as the frac-
tion of experiments in which Wi-Vi correctly decoded the gesture,
whereas Fig. 12(b) shows the average SNRs of the gestures. The
ﬁgures show that Wi-Vi can detect humans and identify their ges-
tures across various indoor building materials: tinted glass, solid
wood doors, 6!! hollow walls, and to a large extent 8!! concrete
walls. As expected, the thicker and denser the obstructing material,
the harder it is for Wi-Vi to capture reﬂections from behind it.
Detecting humans behind different materials depends on Wi-Vi’s
power as well as its ability to eliminate the ﬂash effect. Fig. 13 plots
the CDF of the amount of nulling (i.e., reduction in SNRs) that Wi-
Vi achieves in various experiments. The plot shows Wi-Vi’s nulling

reduces the signal from static objects by a median of 40 dB. This
number indicates that Wi-Vi can eliminate the ﬂash reﬂected off
common building material such as glass, solid wood doors, interior
walls, and concrete walls with a limited thickness [1]. However, it
would not be able to see through denser material like re-enforced
concrete. To improve the nulling, one may use a circulator at the
analog front end [18] or leverage recent advances in full-duplex
radio [14], which were reported to produce 80 dB reduction in in-
terference power [19].
We present Wi-Vi, a wireless technology that uses Wi-Fi sig-
nals to detect moving humans behind walls and in closed rooms.
In contrast to previous systems, which are targeted for the military,
Wi-Vi enables small cheap see-through-wall devices that operate in
the ISM band, rendering them feasible to the general public. Wi-Vi
also establishes a communication channel between itself and a hu-
man behind a wall, allowing him/her to communicate directly with
Wi-Vi without carrying any transmitting device.
We believe that Wi-Vi is an instance of a broader set of func-
tionality that future wireless networks will provide. Future Wi-Fi
networks will likely expand beyond communications and deliver
services such as indoor localization, sensing, and control. Wi-Vi
demonstrates an advanced form of Wi-Fi-based sensing and local-
ization by using Wi-Fi to track humans behind wall, even when they
do not carry a wireless device. It also raises issues of importance to
the networking community pertinent to user privacy and regulations
concerning the use of Wi-Fi signals.
Finally, Wi-Vi bridges state-of-the-art networking techniques
with human-computer interaction. It motivates a new form of user
interfaces which rely solely on using the reﬂections of a transmitted
RF signal to identify human gestures. We envision that by lever-
aging ﬁner nulling techniques and employing better hardware, the
system can evolve to seeing humans through denser building mate-
rial and with a longer range. These improvements will further allow
Wi-Vi to capture higher quality images enabling the gesture-based
interface to become more expressive hence promising new direc-
tions for virtual reality.

Convergence of Iterative Nulling. We prove why iterative nulling pro-
posed in §4 converges. Wi-Vi models the channel estimate errors as ad-
ditive (in line with common practice of modeling quantization error [25]).
Hence, by substituting ˆh1 with h1 +∆ 1, and ˆh2 with h2 +∆ 2, in Eq. 1, we
obtain:
hres = h1 + h2#−

which follows from the ﬁrst order Taylor series approximation of

Iterating on h1 alone. We ﬁrst analyze how the algorithm converges if it
were iterating only on Step 1. According to Algorithm 1, ˆh1 is reﬁned to
hres + ˆh1. By updating the precoding vector, the new received channel after
nulling h!res is hres
by applying the ﬁrst order Taylor series approximation
since ∆2 << h2. Hence,|h !res| << |hres|. Therefore, after the
of
i-th iteration, h(i)
res becomes h(0)
Iterating on h2 alone. We now analyze how the algorithm converges if it
