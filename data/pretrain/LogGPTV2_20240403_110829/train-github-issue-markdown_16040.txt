The following code works in requests 2.7.0 but raises an assertion error in
2.8.0:
    import requests
    session = requests.session()
    session.headers.update({'x-api-key': 'blah', "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
                                  "User-Agent": "magnet-sdk-python"})
    session.verify = True
    req = requests.Request(method='POST', url='https://portal.niddel.com/api/v1-beta/alerts', params=None, json={'a': 1, 'b': 2})
    req = session.prepare_request(req)
    assert req.body
Since I provided neither `files` nor `body`, I would have expected `json` to
work.
In case you need this info to reproduce the issue, all tests were performed on
a Mac OS X with Python 2.7.10 (installed using homebrew).
