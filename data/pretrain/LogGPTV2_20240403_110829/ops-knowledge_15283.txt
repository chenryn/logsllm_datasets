User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to view connected users to open vpn server? I'm developing a website for managing OpenVPN users with Django framework. But I need to know is there any way to extract active users from OpenVPN? My server is running Ubuntu 12.04.

Assistant: There should be a status log you can look at to show you, mine is, for examle:

cat /etc/openvpn/openvpn-status.log

EDIT:

As an alternative, adding the flag --management IP port [pw-file] or adding that same directive to your server.conf, for example: 

management localhost 7505

This would allow  you to telnet to that port and offer you a list of commands to run:

telnet localhost 7505
