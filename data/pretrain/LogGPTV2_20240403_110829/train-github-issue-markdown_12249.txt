I tried using the types/angular-ui-bootstrap package, and now I have tons of
build errors along the lines of:  
"Build" duplicate identifier 'angular'  
these are being raised from the angular-animate index.d.ts (which was fine
before I imported angular-ui-bootstrap)
I also get the error:  
Buile: Module 'angular.ui' has no exported member 'bootstrap' these errors are
in the actual angular-ui-bootstrap index.d.ts file -- sorry, but I really
don't understand what's happening here.
My setup:  
we use typings to pull our definintions (we are on typescript 1.8.10
if I uninstall the angular-ui-bootstrap typings, everything works (we have
over a dozen or so typings packages installed, and no problems, so I _think_
my configuration is ok.
Is there something wrong with the typings, or is there something I should look
at on my end?
I don't know whether this helps, but typings installed the angular-bootstrap-
ui definitions under typings/modules, but all of the other angular-* typings
were installed under typings/globals. I have to confess, I do not understand
the rhyme or reason behind what goes into the /globals folder or the /modules
folder, so maybe that is part of the problem?
