User: To optimize the performance of the database by adjusting parameters, explain what common parameters are needed? What do these parameters do?
Assistant: Common database performance optimization parameters include: 1. Cache size: including query cache, table cache, connection cache, sort cache, etc., which can be adjusted according to specific business load and system resource configuration. Optimizing the cache size can improve query efficiency and reduce IO operations . 2. Log: including binary log, error log, slow query log, etc. Turning on the log can facilitate troubleshooting and performance optimization. 3. Concurrency number: refers to the number of requests processed at the same time, which can be adjusted according to system resources and business load. Setting the number of concurrency reasonably can avoid resource competition and increase of waiting time. 4. Encoding: Character set selection and sorting rules can affect data storage and query efficiency, and need to be selected and optimized according to the actual business situation. 5. Memory size: You can adjust the size of the buffer pool and Sort Buffer to optimize memory utilization and improve query efficiency. 6. Table design: including primary key design, index design and data type selection, etc., which can avoid data redundancy and increase query efficiency. 7. MySQL optimizer: You can avoid full table scans by using indexes, reduce unnecessary disk IO operations, and improve query efficiency. The specific role of these parameters depends on the specific business requirements and system configuration, and adjusting them according to the actual situation can improve system stability and performance.
