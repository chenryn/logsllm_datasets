APPENDIX
A. KP-ABE WITH SHORT CIPHERTEXTS
We introduce KP-ABE with short ciphertexts with an
asymmetric pairing. This scheme is the natural extension of
the scheme in Section 3. We use subscript to denote where
group elements belong to (e.g g1 ∈ G1 and g2 ∈ G2).
A.1 Construction
R←− G(λ, p). Then,
Setup(λ, U , n) First, G1, G2 and GT
the algorithm generates g1 ∈ G1, g2 ∈ G2 and exponents
yv, yw, yv1, yv2, a1, a2, b, α, h0, ..., hn ∈ Zp. Let τ1 = yv +
a1yv1, τ2 = yv + a2yv2. It publishes the public parameters

KeyGen(MSK, PK, A = (A, ρ)) We let Ax denote the xth
row of A and ρ(x) write an attribute associated Ax by the
mapping, ρ. The algorithm randomly chooses r1,x, r2,x, z1,x, z2,x
from Zp for each x ∈ [m], and sets rx = r1,x + r2,x where
A is an m × (cid:96) matrix. It randomly chooses kT agj,x for each
x ∈ [m] and j ∈ [n] from Zp. It randomly selects an (cid:96) size
vector (cid:126)µ ∈ Z(cid:96)
p of which the ﬁrst coordinate equals to α, and
sets λx = Ax(cid:126)µ as the share of Ax. It creates SK as follows
SK := (D1,x, D2,x, D3,x, D4,x, D5,x, D6,x, D7,x,
{Kj,x, kT agj,x;∀j ∈ [n]};∀x ∈ [m])

Decrypt(SK, CT , P K, A, S) First, the algorithm calculates
ρ(x)∈S ωxAx = (1, 0, ...0). For each
x ∈ S, it calculates c0, ..., cn by the same manner of Encrypt,
If
T agx (cid:54)= 0, it calculates
