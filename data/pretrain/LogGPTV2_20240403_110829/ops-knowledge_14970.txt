User: I am writting a daemon server using python, sometimes there are python runtime errors, for example some variable type is not correct. That error will not cause the process to exit.
Is it possible for me to redirect such runtime error to a log file?
Assistant: Look at the traceback module. If you catch a RuntimeError, you can write it to the log (look at the logging module for that).
