**Title: Confidence in Chaos: Strategies for World-Class Security Operations**

In today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, security operations centers (SOCs) face unprecedented challenges. Imagine discovering that the smart lights in your cafeteria are connected to your corporate network and can be controlled from anywhere in the world, or learning that the sales team has been setting up unmanaged AWS accounts for customer demos. To add to the complexity, your organization may have implemented full encryption to comply with data protection and privacy laws without notifying you.

These scenarios highlight the need to quickly build and adapt your detection and response capabilities. SOCs must continuously adjust their defense and detection techniques to counter adversaries lurking within your IT infrastructure. To help you navigate this unpredictable environment, we have developed a strategic roadmap based on in-depth interviews with dozens of SOC teams across various industries, as well as our own decades of experience in different types of SOCs.

This presentation will provide you with practical, actionable steps to enhance your SOC's effectiveness. You will learn how to:

- Identify and prioritize key security challenges.
- Implement robust detection and response strategies.
- Customize your SOC priorities to fit your organization's unique needs.

By the end of the session, attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to address these challenges and a link to a newly released, freely available book that delves into these topics in greater detail. (Please note that while the digital version is free, there is a cost associated with the print-on-demand version, from which neither MITRE nor the authors profit.)

Join us to gain the insights and tools necessary to excel in the ever-changing world of cybersecurity.
