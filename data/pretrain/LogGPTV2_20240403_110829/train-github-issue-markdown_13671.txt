## 📝 Add the ability to duplicate custom templates
When creating a template there are 2 basic ways to go about it. Edit an
existing template type and Edit the "Create new custom" template type. I
believe the ability to duplicate a template would be useful. This is because
the largest barrier to entry to creating new templates is the process of
creating the zones to start with. This can be time-consuming based on the
number and placement of zones in the template.
