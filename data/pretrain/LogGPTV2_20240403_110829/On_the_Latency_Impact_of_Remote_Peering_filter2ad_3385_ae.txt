peering had a substantial eﬀect on latency variability.
as port capacity and AS presence at colocation facilities, to obtain a more trust-
worthy inference methodology. Their method computes the geographical area
where an IXP member’s router could be located and associates the router with
the feasible facilities that a local peering could use. They used this method to
infer RP in 30 IXPs worldwide, and reported that 90% of the analyzed IXPs had
more than 10% of their members using remote peering, with two of the largest
IXPs in terms of members (DE-CIX and AMS-IX) having up to 40% of remote
members. In 2021, the authors extended the previous work [27], with changes in
the methodology and additional analysis on Wide-Area IXPs.
Implications of Remote Peering. In 2017, Giotsas et al. [26] proposed a
methodology for detecting peering infrastructure outages, such as colocation
facilities and IXPs. The authors reported that the rise of remote peering made it
easier for localized failures in IXP and colocation facilities to become widespread.
For two outages observed in London (2016), they showed that more than 45%
of the interfaces related to the aﬀected links were from outside England, with
more than 20% of them being located outside Europe.
In 2019, Bian et al. [11] proposed a methodology to characterize anycast
based on archived BGP routing information collected globally. While trying to
infer anycast preﬁxes, the authors found that remote peering caused a signiﬁ-
cant element of inaccuracy in their method. They reported that RP can cause
unintended consequences on anycast performance and potentially aﬀect 19.2%
of the anycast preﬁxes. Active measurements found that 38% of such preﬁxes
were indeed impacted with an average latency increase of 35.1 ms.

8 Limitations and Future Work
Route Selection. Route selection is a complex problem faced by network oper-
ators, as there are many metrics that could aﬀect traﬃc delivery performance.
In this paper we focused on investigating AS-Path length and latency (Sect. 5
and Sect. 6). Analyzing routing by other metrics is challenging, because of the
lack of reliable information in publicly available datasets regarding transit costs,
economic decisions, and local preference.
Path Relevance. Despite analyzing a considerable number of remote routes,
one question that stands is the relevance of such paths, both in terms of des-
tination popularity and traﬃc carried. Investigating this problem requires data
protected by conﬁdentiality terms and not publicly available (e.g., IXP traﬃc
data) for all IXPs. Additionally, many IXPs do not have an implemented and
automated way to measure traﬃc ﬂowing through each announced route, and
are able to only share aggregated traﬃc per AS.
IPv6. We focused on IPv4 IXP interfaces and IPv4 announced preﬁxes. Six out
of eight RouteViews collectors used in our work did not have IPv6 transit that
would enable us to study IPv6. We hope to investigate IPv6 routes in the future.
Distributed IXPs. Our analysis considered only IXP facilities within a sin-
gle metropolitan area, avoiding wide-area peering infrastructures. Our method
would not work for distributed IXPs because we used a delay-based methodology
and ground truth data to infer remote peering [15]. In distributed IXPs, local
members connected at facilities far from the IXP region could present very high
latencies and, consequently, be inferred as remote.
Future Work. Our ﬁndings help to characterize the latency impact of remote
peering. Beyond the analysis we performed, we believe that considering addi-
tional IXPs, and analyzing IPv6 preﬁxes would improve the community’s under-
standing of remote peering in the context of other available route types. Improv-
ing current methodologies is also crucial to promote further research on RP
implications to performance and security. Our methodology used a 10 ms latency
threshold to infer geographical remote peering. While the threshold is conserva-
tive, it was adequate to identify networks connected far from IXPs. However, a
deeper analysis of the impact of using diﬀerent latency thresholds (e.g., 2 ms and
5 ms) is needed. We also plan to leverage our ground truth data about networks
connected via resellers to investigate better approaches to infer remote peering
connections.
9 Final Remarks
IXPs are critical infrastructures that support ever-increasing data volumes and
service requirements of modern Internet services. However, the recent growth of
remote peering introduces new challenges for traﬃc engineering because peering
may no longer keep local traﬃc local. Our paper shed light on the latency impact

of reaching addresses in remotely announced preﬁxes at IXPs via remote routes,
local peering routes, and regular transit, and had the following key ﬁndings.
Inferring Remote Peering is Still Challenging. Using IXP ground truth
and delay measurements, we showed that current state-of-the-art methodologies
have limitations. We show that relying on public network data can result in a
sizable fraction of unknown inferences for some IXPs, caused by public data being
unavailable for some classes of networks. Compared to the European, American,
and Asian IXPs evaluated in [42], reduced data availability in some regions, such
as Latin America, limits the accuracy of remote peering inferences.
The Route Preferred by BGP is not Always the Lowest Latency
Route. When investigating the use of remote routes in the BGP routing, we
detected a high prevalence of preﬁxes announced both by remote and local peer-
ings in four IXPs (LINX, AMS-IX, Eq-Ash, and Eq-Chi). We found that most
remote routes for these preﬁxes had a shorter or equal AS path length com-
pared to the available local routes and tended to be preferred by the peers of
RouteViews collectors. Despite being shorter and indeed preferred, they were
not necessarily the lowest latency route. For at least 61.2% of these preﬁxes in
seven IXPs, the local route had lower latency compared to the geographically
distant remote peering routes.
Remote Routes are a Reliable Option to Deliver Traﬃc at IXPs. Some
preﬁxes have only remote routes at IXPs, and ASes must choose between deliv-
ering their traﬃc via remote peering or a transit provider. Our measurements
suggest that relying on remote routes can be an advantageous option for end-to-
end latencies. In some scenarios (NAPAfrica and Eq-Chi), remote routes at the
IXPs had considerably better latency results when compared to transit, showing
latency improvements of at least 40 ms for 81.4% of the measured preﬁxes, when
the remote route was faster than transit. For the other six IXPs, we observed
that the latency diﬀerence of using the remote route or the transit was no higher
than 5 ms for 78.1% of the measured preﬁxes.
The Connection Type or Geographical Distance does not Directly
Impact Latency Variability for Remote Routes. A concern about remote
peering growth at IXPs is that networks using a reseller or being geographically
distant limits the original performance beneﬁts of peering. Our measurements
suggest that remote peering does not introduce additional latency variability to
reach addresses in these preﬁxes. For 75% of the remote preﬁxes, we observed
less than 10 ms of latency variability for remote connections.
