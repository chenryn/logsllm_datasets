User: I have a question regarding the command for running the training in Linux. I am using GoogleNet model in caffe framework for binary classification of my images. I used the following command to train my dataset
./build/tools/caffe train --solver=models/MyModelGoogLenet/quick_solver.prototxt
But I received this error
bash: ./build/tools/caffe: No such file or directory
How can I resolve this error? Any suggestions would be of great help.
Assistant: You should specify absolute paths to all your files and commands, to be on the safer side. If /home/user/build/tools/caffe train still doesn't work, check if you have a build directory in your caffe root. If not, then use /home/user/tools/caffe train instead.
