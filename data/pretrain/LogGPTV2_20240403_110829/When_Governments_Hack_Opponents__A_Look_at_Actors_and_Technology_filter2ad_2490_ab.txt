3 Data Overview and Implications
Our study is based on extensive analysis of malicious ﬁles and
suspect communications relevant to the activities of targeted
groups in Bahrain, Syria, and the UAE, as documented in Ta-
ble 1. A number of the attacks had signiﬁcant real-world impli-
cations, per Table 2. In many cases, we keep our descriptions
somewhat imprecise to avoid potential leakage of target identi-
ties.
We began our work when contacted by individuals con-
cerned that a government might have targeted them for cyber-
attacks. As we became more acquainted with the targeted com-
munities, in some cases we contacted targeted groups directly;
in others, we reached out to individuals with connections to tar-
geted groups, who allowed us to examine their communications
with the groups. For Bahrain and Syria, the work encompassed
10,000s of e-mails and instant messages. For the UAE, the vol-
ume is several thousand communications.
4 Case Studies: Three Countries
This following sections outline recent targeted hacking cam-
paigns in Bahrain, Syria and the UAE. These cases have a com-
mon theme: attacks against targets’ computers and devices with
malicious ﬁles and links. In some cases the attackers employed
expensive and “government exclusive” malware, while in other
cases, attackers used cheap and readily available RATs. Across
these cases we ﬁnd that clever social engineering often plays
a central role, which is strong evidence of a well-informed ad-
versary. We also, however, frequently ﬁnd technical and op-
erational errors by the attackers that enable us to link attacks
to governments. In general, the attacks we ﬁnd are not well-
detected by anti-virus programs.
4.1 Bahrain
We have analyzed two attack campaigns in the context of
Bahrain, where the government has been pursuing a crackdown
against an Arab-Spring inspired uprising since 2/14/2011.
The ﬁrst involved malicious e-mails containing FinSpy, a
“lawful intercept” trojan sold exclusively to governments. The
second involved specially crafted IP spy links and e-mails de-
signed to reveal the IP addresses of operators of pseudonymous
accounts. Some individuals who apparently clicked on these
links were later arrested, including Ali (cf. §1), whose click
appears to have been used against him in court. While both
campaigns point back to the government, we have not as yet
identiﬁed overlap between the campaigns; targets of FinSpy
appeared to reside mainly outside Bahrain, whereas the IP spy
links targeted those mainly inside the country. We examine
each campaign in turn.
FinSpy Campaign. Beginning in April 2012, the authors
received 5 suspicious e-mails from US and UK-based activists
and journalists working on Bahrain. We found that some
of the attachments contained a PE (.exe) ﬁle designed to
appear as an image.
Their ﬁlenames contained a Uni-
code right-to-left override (RLO) character, causing Windows
to render a ﬁlename such as gpj.1bajaR.exe instead as
exe.Rajab1.jpg.
The other .rar ﬁles contained a Word document with an
embedded ASCII-encoded PE ﬁle containing a custom macro
set to automatically run upon document startup. Under default
security settings, Ofﬁce disables all unsigned macros, so that
a user who opens the document will only see an informational
message that the macro has been disabled. Thus, this attack was
apparently designed with the belief or hope that targets would
have reduced security settings.

Identiﬁcation as FinSpy: By running the sample using
Windows Virtual PC, we found the following string in mem-
ory: y:\lsvn_branches\finspyv4.01\finspyv2\.
This string suggests FinSpy, a product of Gamma Inter-
national [27].
The executables used virtualized obfusca-
tion [28], which appeared to be custom-designed. We de-
vised a ﬁngerprint for the obfuscater and located a structurally
similar executable by searching a large malware database.
This executable contained a similar string, except it identi-
ﬁed itself as FinSpy v3.00, and attempted to connect to
tiger.gamma-international.de, a domain registered
to Gamma International GmbH.
Analysis of capabilities: We found that the spyware has
a modular design, and can download additional modules from
a command & control (C&C) server, including password cap-
ture (from over 20 applications) and recording of screenshots,
Skype chat, ﬁle transfers, and input from the computer’s micro-
phone and webcam.
To exﬁltrate data back to the C&C server, a module encrypts
and writes it to disk in a special folder. The spyware period-
ically probes this folder for ﬁles that match a certain naming
convention, then sends them to the C&C server. It then over-
writes the ﬁles, renames them several times, and deletes them,
in an apparent effort to frustrate forensic analysis.
Analysis of encryption: Because the malware employed
myriad known anti-debugging and anti-analysis techniques, it
thwarted our attempts to attach debuggers. Since it did not in-
clude anti-VM code, we ran it in TEMU, an x86 emulator de-
signed for malware analysis [29]. TEMU captures instruction-
level execution traces and provides support for taint-tracking.
We found that FinSpy encrypts data using a custom imple-
mentation of AES-256-CBC. The 32 byte AES key and 16 byte
IV are generated by repeatedly reading the low-order-4-bytes of
the Windows clock. The key and IV are encrypted using an em-
bedded RSA-2048 public key, and stored in the same ﬁle as the
data. The private key presumably resides on the C&C server.
The weak AES keys make decryption of the data straightfor-
ward. We wrote a program that generally can ﬁnd these keys in
under an hour, exploiting the fact that many of the system clock
readings occur within the same clock-update quantum.
In addition, FinSpy’s AES code fails to encrypt the last block
of data if less than the AES block size of 128 bits, leaving trail-
ing plaintext. Finally, FinSpy’s wire protocol for C&C commu-
nication uses the same type of encryption, and thus is subject
to the same brute force attack on AES keys. While we suspect
FinSpy’s cryptographic deﬁciencies reﬂect bugs, it is also con-
ceivable that the cryptography was deliberately weakened to
facilitate one government monitoring the surveillance of oth-
ers.
The
C&C server:
communicated with
samples
to a subscriber of
77.69.140.194, which belongs
Batelco, Bahrain’s main ISP. Analyzing network trafﬁc
between our infected VM and the C&C server revealed that
the server used a global IPID, which allowed us to infer server
activity by its progression.
In response to our preliminary work an executive at Gamma
told the press that Bahrain’s FinSpy server was merely a proxy
and the real server could have been anywhere, as part of a claim
that the Bahrain FinSpy deployment could have been associ-
4
ated with another government [4]. However, a proxy would
show gaps in a global IPID as it forwarded trafﬁc; our frequent
observation of strictly consecutive IPIDs thus contradicts this
statement.
Exploitation of captured data: Since we suspected the spy-
ware operator would likely seek to exploit captured credentials,
particularly those associated with Bahraini activist organiza-
tions, we worked with Bahrain Watch, an activist organization
inside Bahrain. Bahrain Watch established a fake login page
on their website and provided us with a username and pass-
word. From a clean VM, we logged in using these credentials,
saving the password in Mozilla Firefox. We then infected the
VM with FinSpy and allowed it to connect to the Bahrain C&C
server. Bahrain Watch’s website logs revealed a subsequent
hit from 89.148.0.41—made however to the site’s home-
page, rather than its login page—coming shortly after we had
infected the VM. Decrypting packet captures of the spyware’s
activity, we found that our VM sent the password to the server
exactly one minute earlier:
INDEX,URL,USERNAME,PASSWORD,USERNAME FIELD,
PASSWORD FIELD,FILE,HTTP 1,
http://bahrainwatch.org,bhwatch1,watchba7rain,
username,password,signons.sqlite,,
Very Strong,3.5/4.x
The URL provided to the server did not include the path
to the login page, which was inaccessible from the home-
page. This omission reﬂects the fact that the Firefox password
database stores only domain names, not full login page URLs,
for each password. Repeating the experiment again yielded a
hit from the same IP address within a minute. We inspected
Bahrain Watch’s logs, which showed no subsequent (or previ-
ous) activity from that address, nor any instances of the same
User Agent string.
IP spy Campaign.
In an IP spy attack, the attacker aims to
discover the IP address of a victim who is typically the opera-
tor of a pseudonymous social media or e-mail account. The at-
tacker sends the pseudonymous account a link to a webpage or
an e-mail containing an embedded remote image, using one of
many freely-available services.2 When the victim clicks on the
link or opens the e-mail, their IP address is revealed to the at-
tacker.3 The attacker then discovers the victim’s identity from
their ISP. In one case we identiﬁed legal documents that pro-
vided a circumstantial link between such a spy link and a sub-
sequent arrest.
Figure 2 illustrates the larger ecosystem of these attacks. The
attackers appear to represent a single entity, as the activity all
connects back to accounts that sent links shortened using a par-
ticular user account al9mood4 on the bit.ly URL shortening
service.
Recall Ali Faisal Al-Shufa (discussed in Section 1), who
was accused of sending insulting tweets from an account
2e.g., iplogger.org, ip-spy.com, ReadNotify.com.

automatically block loading this content, but e-mails spoofed to come
from a trusted sender sometimes bypass these defenses.

While ReadNotify.com forbids spooﬁng in their TOS,
the service has a vulnerability known to the attackers (and
which we conﬁrmed) that allows spooﬁng the From address
by directly setting the parameters on a submission form on their
website We have not found evidence suggesting this vulnerabil-
ity is publicly known, but it appears clear that the attacker ex-
ploited it, as the web form adds a X-Mai1er:
RNwebmail
header not added when sending through ReadNotify.com’s
other supported methods. The header appeared in each e-mail
the targets forwarded to us.
When spooﬁng using this method, the original sender ad-
dress still appears in X-Sender and other headers. Accord-
ing to these, the e-mails received by the targets all came from
fatoomah85@gmail.com. A link sent in one of these e-
mails was connected to the al9mood bit.ly account.
In monitoring accounts connected to al9mood, we counted
more than 200 IP spy links in Twitter messages and public
Facebook posts. Attackers often used (1) accounts of promi-
nent or trusted but jailed individuals like “Red Sky,” (2) fake
personas (e.g., attractive women or fake job seekers when tar-
geting a labor union), or (3) impersonations of legitimate ac-
counts.
In one particularly clever tactic, attackers exploited
Twitter’s default font, for example substituting a lowercase “l”
with an uppercase “I” or switching vowels (e.g. from “a” to
an “e”) to create at-a-glance identical usernames. In addition,
malicious accounts tended to quickly delete IP spy tweets sent
via (public) mentions, and frequently change proﬁle names.
4.2 Syria
The use of RATs against the opposition has been a well-
documented feature of the Syrian Civil War since the ﬁrst re-
ports were published in early 2012 [36, 39, 40, 32, 34]. The
phenomenon is widespread, and in our experience, most mem-
bers of the opposition know that some hacking is taking place.
As summarized in Table 3, the attacks often include fake or ma-
liciously packaged security tools; intriguing, or ideological, or
movement-relevant content (e.g. lists of wanted persons). The
seeding techniques and bait ﬁles suggest a good understanding
of the opposition’s needs, fears and behavior, coupled with ba-
sic familiarity with off-the-shelf RATs. In some cases attacks
occur in a context that points to a more direct connection to
one of the belligerents: the Syrian opposition has regularly ob-
served that detainees’ accounts begin seeding malware shortly
after their arrest by government forces [41].
Researchers and security professionals have already proﬁled
many of these RATs, including DarkComet [42, 43], Black-
shades Remote Controller [38], Xtreme RAT [44], njRAT [26],
and ShadowTech [36]. Some are available for purchase by any-
one, in contrast to “government only” FinSpy and RCS. For ex-
ample, Xtreme RAT retails for e350, while a version of Black-
shades lists for e40. Others, like DarkComet, are free. We
have also observed cracked versions of these RATs on Arabic-
language hacker forums, making them available with little ef-
fort and no payment trail. While the RATs are cheaper and less

sophisticated than FinSpy and RCS, they share the same ba-
sic functionality, including screen capture, keylogging, remote
monitoring of webcams and microphones, remote shell, and ﬁle
exﬁltration.
In the most common attack sequence we observed, illus-
trated with three examples in Figure 3, the attacker seeds mal-
ware via private chat messages, posts in opposition-controlled
social media groups, or e-mail. These techniques often limit
the world-visibility of malicious ﬁles and links, slowing their
