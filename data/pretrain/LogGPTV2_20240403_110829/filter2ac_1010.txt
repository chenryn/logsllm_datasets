### Title: Discovering 20-Year-Old Vulnerabilities in the Modern Windows Kernel

With continuous upgrades by Microsoft, the latest versions of Windows 10 have become increasingly powerful and feature-rich. However, certain components, such as printer drivers, have remained largely unchanged. The print driver architecture includes both the GDI (Graphics Device Interface) kernel and the user-mode printer driver (UMPD). Despite its age, the security of the printer driver has often been overlooked, even though the interaction between the UMPD and the GDI kernel presents a significant attack surface.

In this talk, we will discuss how we uncovered novel and unique vulnerabilities in the ancient code of the Windows system. Specifically, we developed a specialized fuzzer for the user-mode print driver, which effectively identified multiple vulnerabilities in the Windows graphics kernel. We will delve into the design principles and implementation techniques used in our fuzzer. Additionally, we will provide detailed insights into two vulnerabilities that have been fixed, highlighting the security implications of the UMPD attack surface.
