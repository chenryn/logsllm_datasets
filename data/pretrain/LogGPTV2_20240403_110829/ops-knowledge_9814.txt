User: How to detect and defend against DDoS attacks in the network?
Assistant: 1. Real-time monitoring of network traffic: Through real-time monitoring of network traffic, abnormal burst traffic can be found in time to determine whether it is a DDoS attack. 2. Install a firewall: Installing a firewall can help block the traffic of DDoS attacks, and set different defense strategies for different attack methods. 3. Use reverse proxy: reverse proxy can shield the real IP address of the server, so that attackers cannot directly attack the server. 4. Configure Load Balancer: Configure Load Balancer to distribute traffic to multiple servers, thereby reducing the pressure on a single server and preventing the server from crashing due to DDoS attacks. 5. Reasonable allocation of bandwidth resources: Reasonable allocation of bandwidth resources can divert DDoS attacks to other idle bandwidth, reducing the impact of attacks on key services. 6. Update the security patch: Update the security patch of the server in time, which can alleviate the risk of DDoS attack and improve the security of the server. 7. Reasonable allocation of resources: If necessary, measures can be taken in groups or by time intervals to rationally allocate network and server resources to reduce the overload of the network and servers. 8. Detect the source of the attack: By detecting the IP address of the attack source, you can find the location of the attacker, and take corresponding technical and legal measures to attack the attacker.
