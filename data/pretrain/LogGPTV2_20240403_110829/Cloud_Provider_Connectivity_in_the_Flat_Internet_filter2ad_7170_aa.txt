ABSTRACT
The Tier-1 ISPs have been considered the Internet’s backbone
since the dawn of the modern Internet 30 years ago, as they
guarantee global reachability. However, their influence and
importance are waning as Internet flattening decreases the
demand for transit services and increases the importance of
private interconnections. Conversely, major cloud providers –
Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft– are gaining in importance
as more services are hosted on their infrastructures. They ardently
support Internet flattening and are rapidly expanding their
global footprints, which enables them to bypass the Tier-1 ISPs
and other large transit providers to reach many destinations.
In this paper we seek to quantify the extent to which the
cloud providers’ can bypass the Tier-1 ISPs and other large transit
providers. We conduct comprehensive measurements to identify
the neighbor networks of the major cloud providers and combine
them with AS relationship inferences to model the Internet’s
AS-level topology to calculate a new metric, hierarchy-free
reachability, which characterizes the reachability a network can
achieve without traversing the networks of the Tier-1 and Tier-2
ISPs. We show that the cloud providers are able to reach over 76%
of the Internet without traversing the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, more
than virtually every other network.

1 INTRODUCTION
Internet flattening, the shortening of paths between destinations
due to more densely connected topology [29, 39, 57], has fundamen-
tally altered the Internet’s structure over the past decade. Today
the preponderance of Internet traffic is generated and transmit-
ted by a handful of networks, and it is essentially invisible to the
traditional Internet hierarchy because it transpires over private
interconnects [71, 87, 115, 118]. The increased interconnectivity
between networks bypasses the transit networks which comprise
the traditional hierarchical Internet’s upper echelons, such as the
Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, thereby reducing reliance on their services
and putting them under increasing economic pressure [91].
Contributing to transit networks’ decline in revenue, traffic
volume, and relevance is an increasing dependence on top cloud
provider networks, especially Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft.
The cloud providers have well-provisioned WANs to convey ten-
ant traffic [83], interconnect with thousands of other networks [8,
26], support service requirements at any scale, and are deploying
Points of Presence (PoPs) and datacenters at a rapid pace [121].
Many businesses, including several of the Internet’s largest compa-
nies [11, 35, 56, 73], host their frontend and/or backend systems on
(multiple [119]) cloud provider infrastructure(s).
With the increased reliance on cloud provider infrastructures
and shift away from transit [91], it is essential to understand to what
extent the cloud providers are able to operate independently from
the traditional Internet hierarchy and facilitate connectivity to pub-
lic facing services hosted on their infrastructures. Specifically, we
are interested in understanding how close the cloud providers are
to individually achieving global reachability without traversing the
Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. The extent to which the cloud providers can
bypass the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs has implications for future con-
nectivity between networks, network resilience, the cloud providers
driving further changes to the Internet’s topology, and predicting
future changes that impact the cloud and transit provider networks.
Despite undergoing much scrutiny, the Internet’s topology and
routing remains relatively opaque due to shortcomings in existing
measurement techniques and routing policies being considered
proprietary. Prior studies examined cloud provider connectivity,
such as showing an order of magnitude more direct connectivity
for cloud providers than earlier work [26]. Others explored how
central large content providers and CDNs are to the Internet [22, 23],
basing their comparison on the connectivity of the Tier-1 ISPs. The
studies look at the cloud providers’ degree of connectivity and the
shortening of paths, but they do not examine the networks the
cloud providers use to deliver traffic (e.g., whether they bypass the
Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs). There are metrics to measure the influence
of a network on the Internet, such as customer cone (the set of
Autonomous Systems (ASes) that an AS can reach using links to
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
T. Arnold et al.
customer networks [64]) and transit degree (the number of unique
neighbors that appear on either side of an AS in adjacent links [64]).
The metrics are focused on how many networks an AS can provide
transit services for, but do not capture how or where much of the
Internet’s traffic flows because they lack visibility into edge (e.g.,
cloud) network connectivity [25, 77, 115].
Our first contribution is to quantify the degree to which the
cloud providers can bypass the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs when serving
publicly facing cloud-hosted services. To do so, we model an AS-
level topology graph and calculate the number of networks that
are reachable by the cloud providers without traversing the Tier-1
and Tier-2 ISPs. Our model combines AS relationship data from
BGP feeds [15] with comprehensive traceroute measurements from
inside each cloud provider to identify neighbors (§4). Combining
the two datasets overcomes the shortfalls of each, presenting a
more thorough view of cloud provider connectivity than prior
studies [22, 23, 26]. Google and Microsoft validated that 85-89% of
our inferred neighbors are correct (§5).
We use the modeled topology to introduce a new metric,
hierarchy-free reachability, that quantifies the level of indepen-
dence the cloud providers are able to achieve by measuring the
number of networks which are still reachable without the Tier-1
and Tier-2 ISPs. We show that the cloud providers are more
independent than virtually every other network (§6), and each has
the potential to reach at least 76% of networks without traversing
the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs at the time of our measurements. We
also examine which networks the cloud providers use to reach
destinations when bypassing the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs (§7). The
cloud provider’s independence also has security implications; Tier-
1 ISPs are known to propagate routing leaks [96], and their large
footprints help to unwittingly propagate attacks with widespread
effects. We show that the cloud providers’ independence also
protects them from the effects of route leaks (§8).
Our second contribution is a detailed examination of how the
cloud providers are able to achieve such a degree of independence
from the large transit providers despite their different strategies for
establishing connectivity to other networks (§9). We examine the
infrastructure of the cloud providers, specifically PoP deployment
and proximity to large user populations. We consolidate multiple
public data resources, such as network maps, providers’ online PoP
listings, Peering DB [81], and rDNS information to generate topolo-
gies for the four cloud providers and many Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
We show that the deployment strategies are closely tied to prox-
imity to user population centers and that the similarities between
the cloud provider and Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs’ deployments help to
enable the cloud providers’ independence.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 The Good Old Hierarchical Internet
The conventional view of the Internet is a tiered, hierarchical topol-
ogy where edge networks comprise the hierarchy’s basal layer [29,
39, 57, 64]. At the apex are the Tier-1 ISPs which have large global
networks and are fully interconnected with each other [57, 114].
Key to the hierarchical topology is the concept of transit. A network
is a transit provider if it allows traffic from external sources to tra-
verse its infrastructure to reach external destinations. Lower tiers
pay higher tier networks for transit services to access the rest of
the Internet. The Tier-1 ISPs establish settlement-free peering agree-
ments amongst themselves, meaning they interconnect with each
other and do not charge each other for transit. These agreements
assure the Internet’s global reachability property.
The protocol for exchanging reachability information between
networks is BGP. A network, or AS, establishes a neighbor relation-
ship with another AS. These interconnected neighbors exchange
information about the destination IP prefixes each is willing to trans-
port traffic towards. Any pair of ASes are free to establish neighbor
connections between themselves if they both agree to do so.
2.2 Internet Flattening
An amalgamation of factors converged to drive Internet flattening.
One factor was the rise of Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) and coloca-
tion facilities (colos) [24, 70], which facilitate inter-AS connectivity
through public (shared capacity and peering) or private intercon-
nections (dedicated AS-to-AS peering and capacity also known as
Private Network Interconnects (PNIs)) [3]. The increased direct
connectivity available at IXPs reduces transit costs and affords im-
proved control over routing, utilization, and performance [26, 89].
Parallel to IXP growth, cloud and content providers made sub-
stantial investments towards expanding their global footprints. The
cloud providers deploy PoPs at IXPs and colocation facilities for
closer proximity to user ISPs. They are also deploying enormous
datacenters at a rapid pace; for example, Microsoft doubled the
number of datacenter locations (a.k.a regions) across the globe
from 2015 - 2018 [121]. Finally, they built massive private WANs to
interconnect their datacenters and PoPs, investing billions of dol-
lars towards network infrastructure [90] and collectively now own
or lease approximately 50% of global undersea fiber capacity [13].
Not all cloud providers have private global WANs, and not all
cloud providers route tenant services across their WAN. Each of the
four providers we focus on have an expansive, global private WAN
and route at least some tenant traffic across their WANs [119]. By
default, Amazon tenant traffic egress/ingresses near the datacenter
rather than using their WAN, but Amazon does offer services to
route tenant traffic across its WAN [4].
With the capital investment in infrastructure, the cloud providers
now function as total service environments. Even some of the
largest online companies (e.g., Netflix, Apple, Spotify, Lyft) rely
heavily on the cloud providers, and some are beginning to use the
features of multiple cloud providers [56]. Amazon, Google, IBM,
and Microsoft are the marketplace’s top players [91, 116].
2.3 AS Topology Graphs
Analyzing the Internet at the AS-level is an area of considerable
research. Methods to create an AS-level topology rely on the as-
sumption that most interconnects between a pair of ASes can be
classified as either Peer-to-Peer (p2p) or Customer-to-Provider (c2p)
(p2c depending on perspective) [36]. For p2c relationships, a cus-
tomer pays a provider to carry its traffic to other networks. In a p2p
relationship the two peer ASes inform each other of routes through
their customers, not provider or other peer networks.
Links are classified based on the valley-free assumption, meaning
each path consists of zero or more c2p links, zero or one p2p links,
Cloud Provider Connectivity in the Flat Internet

followed by a segment of zero or more p2c links. Models often as-
sume that networks prefer to use p2c links over p2p and prefer p2p
over c2p [37]. The current state of the art algorithm for inferring AS
relationships to construct AS-level topology graphs is Problink [53].
An implication of valley-free routing is that many p2p links are
only visible to an AS and its customers. Since topologies are built
from a small number of Vantage Points (VPs), they are unable to
see p2p links from other parts of the Internet.
3 GOALS
The cloud providers continue to expand their WANs, PoPs, and peer-
ing footprints, and more services depend on their infrastructures,
we want to understand their independence from the traditional
Internet hierarchy to reach the rest of the Internet. To determine
the cloud providers’ independence we need to answer:
Goal 1: To what extent are the cloud providers able to bypass
the Internet hierarchy when serving their cloud tenant traf-
fic? (§§ 6 to 8) Extensive interconnectivity between ASes reduces
transit costs and improves control over routing, utilization, and
performance [26, 46, 68, 89]. It also renders the traffic invisible to
all but the parties involved. To understand the cloud providers’
independence from the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, we need to identify
the cloud providers’ connectivity and develop a method to quantify
their potential to deliver hosted services without traversing the
networks of the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
Goal 2: What are the characteristics of the cloud providers’
PoP deployment strategies? (§9) During the decade of Internet
flattening, the cloud providers were able to deploy massive net-
works to support delivering hosted services. To interconnect with
more remote networks, the cloud providers had to expand their
infrastructure and establish PoPs around the world. To understand
how the cloud providers are able to achieve independence, we seek
to understand the geographic coverage and proximity to user pop-
ulations of cloud and transit providers’ network PoP deployments.
4 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
To evaluate the extent and impact of the cloud provider’s intercon-
nectivity, we consolidate multiple datasets and measurements.
4.1 AS Topology Graph and Measurements
We determine reachability between different networks by modeling
the AS-level topology of the Internet. There are shortfalls to using
either of the two most common tools for mapping Internet topolo-
gies: BGP feeds and traceroutes. By combining the two sources, we
leverage the benefits of each while minimizing their weaknesses.
AS-level topology graph. BGP feeds lack visibility into edge net-
work connectivity [25, 32, 77] and routing policies [5, 77] based on
the number and location of the BGP monitors. Despite bias and
shortfalls, BGP feeds provide a high level of visibility and com-
pleteness for c2p links and those of the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs [41,
53, 64, 77]. There is considerable prior work for constructing AS-
level topologies from BGP feeds [36, 37, 52, 53, 64, 77]. We use the
CAIDA September 2020 AS-Relationship dataset based on public
BGP feeds that also incorporates Ark traceroute data for generating
our topology graph [15].
