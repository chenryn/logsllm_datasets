Currently with the extensions API, we have access to output channels (creation
and access through `vscode.window.createOutputChannel()`). And likewise, we
can get adhoc user input through `vscode.window.showInputBox`.
I think what would be really helpful is if the extensions API included the
capability to have a console-like experience, much like the **debug console**
has (input part of the experience with the output). Not necessarily for
"debugging" purposes, but for a more consistent and extended user experience
exchange for ongoing for **user input creation** , then **VS Code output
consumption** , followed by more **user input creation** , ... so on and so
forth.
At the moment, the `showInputBox()` functionality with the output channel can
seem like a one-time exchange, without the continuity of a input/output
console (like the debugger console).
