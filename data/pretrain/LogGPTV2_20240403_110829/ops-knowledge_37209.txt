User: I have 2 Google App Engine applications which share memcache items, one app writes the items and the other apps reads them. This works in production. however - locally using the SDK, items written by one app are not available to the other. Is there a way to make this work?
Assistant: Actually two different App Engine apps cannot see the same items in memcache.  Their memcache spaces are totally isolated from each other.
However two different modules of the same app use the same memcache space and can read and write the same items. Modules act like sub-apps. Is that what you meant?
It is also possible to have different versions of an app (or module) running at the same time (for example to do A/B testing), and these also use the same memcache space.
