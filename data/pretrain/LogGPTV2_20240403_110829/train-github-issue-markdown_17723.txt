  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I expected to have my .json file returned.
## Current Behavior
Instead, I was asked for 'module' or 'render' objects.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create a JSON file to import
  2. use dynamic(require) to import the file
  3. voila
## Context
I'd like to use the dynamic import in a page-loading situation whereby my
.md/json is loaded in on the prop-injection. Better than working with fetch as
the export function is respected by next and the require baked-in.
