B SURVEY QUESTIONS OF THE USER STUDY
ON THE USABILITY OF CGUARD
Background Introduction
Please watch the background introduction video [49] in the
following link before you answer.
Post-Video Questions
Based on the above background, it is clear that the coexistence of
vendor applications (e.g. Ring app) and third-party applications (e.g.
HomeKit app) poses a risk to the security of IoT devices, enabling
attackers to illegally control target devices in different scenarios.
For this reason, we have designed a multi-channel control platform
for IoT devices, which actively shuts down channels that are not
used by users to prevent unauthorized access by others. You are
invited to evaluate the usability of our solution design based on
your personal experience and preference.
Users can still choose any channel configuration and use the
device after the purchase of the device. For users who prefer differ-
ent channels, we have added the following security policy to the
original features.
(1) The unused channel on your IoT device can enable an at-
tacker to gain access and control over your device. Should
these risks be addressed?
A. Yes, this is a serious risk. If my front door lock (a smart
lock) has such a risk, I want the manufacturer to seriously
fix it.
B. No, I don’t care about the risk even though the attacker
might control my door lock without my consents and aware-
ness.
C. This is a risk, but I have other thoughts.
D. No, I don’t care about this risk on my lock.
(2) If you answered C or D for question 1, please specify your
answer and give a brief description of why you answered in
that way.
(3) Do you want a way to control/close channels that you don’t
use for your device (e.g., a smart lock)? For example, if you
use the manufacturer app, you can simply toggle to switch
on/off the HomeKit channel (by default it is off) on the device.
A. Yes, I want to be able to control channels I am not using.
I think this solution is acceptable and easy to use.
B. Yes, I want to be able to control channels that I am not
using. I think this solution is acceptable, although a bit an-
noying to use.
Session 5A: Control System SecurityCCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1303C. Yes, I want to be able to control channels that I am not
using. But I think this solution is unacceptable with too many
efforts.
D. No, I do not want to be able to control channels that I am
not using, although this can leave my unused channels open
for the attackers.
E.Other.
(4) Please briefly explain your answer for Question 3.
(5) The scenario: suppose most of your home devices are cur-
rently managed using Apple Home app (the HomeKit chan-
nel). Now you get a brand new smart lock for your front
door, and you configure/connect it with your Apple Home.
In the meantime, do you prefer to...
A. Once you use the Apple app to control the device, the
manufacturer channel is automatically closed to prevent
others from using it to control your device without your
consent (for security, the manufacturer channel will silently
remain closed unless you factory-reset the device).
B. Manually open/close the manufacturer channel by down-
loading/using the manufacturer app.
C. The above options are unacceptable to me. I prefer to take
the risk that my lock is controlled by others without my
consent.
D. The above options are unacceptable to me. I prefer some-
thing else.
(6) Please briefly explain your answer for Question 5.
(7) What other suggestions do you have for the above multi-
channel control security scheme for devices? (Optional)
(8) On a scale of 1-5, how important is it that you are able
to freely choose which channel (manufacturer channel or
HomeKit) you initiate your device on (1 as least important
and 5 as most important)?
(9) Please briefly tell us how much experience you had for using
IoT device(s).
A. I own and use at lease one IoT device
B. My household owns and uses at least one IoT device
C. Both myself and my household owns and uses at least one
IoT device
D. Other:
C INCONSISTENT POLICY BETWEEN DMCS
FROM THE SAME VENDOR
A surprising finding made in our research is that not only have the
DMCs from different parties failed to work together, but even those
from the same manufacturer are often not well synchronized in
terms of security protection.
Flaw 6: HomeKit in-fight. HomeKit enables the user to manage
devices locally and remotely, which are supported by the local
HomeKit DMC (just HAP) and the cloud-based HomeKit DMC
(through iCloud and a HomeKit hub), respectively. These two DMCs
maintain their own access control lists (ACLs) and enforce their
policies independently. In the local DMC, the user who first pairs
with the device is the owner, and only the owner can add other
users (identified by unique public keys) onto the device’s local ACL.
By contrast, in the cloud-based DMC, the user and the device are
managed at the “Home” granularity: one who creates the Home (the
Homekit structure for organizing all devices in a given location such
as a house) is its owner, and is allowed to control, add and remove
devices, invite other users (identified by their Apple ID, usually an e-
mail address) to the Home and give them the permission to add and
remove devices. In the absence of guidance, even the DMCs from
the same party could become inconsistent in their security policy
configuration and enforcement, which can lead to unauthorized
access.
Figure 8: Abusing HomeKit Adding Accessory Workflow
Specifically, in a normal situation, the owner of a Home (the
cloud-based DMC) should also be the owner in the ACLs (for the
local DMCs) of all devices under the Home, while other users are
the guests. This expectation, however, is fallen short of when a
guest adds accessories to the Home: we found from both emulated
HomeKit devices and the workflow of the “adding accessory” pro-
cedure that the guest actually becomes the owner of the new device
through the local DMC, since she is the party who first pairs the
device with the Home app, as shown in Figure 8. Although HomeKit
later will automatically downgrade her to guest and make the Home
owner the owner of the device, there is a short window before the
change of ownership that allows the guest to stealthily add an-
other account (public key) to the device ACL (2a in Figure 8). This
addition will not be communicated to the owner and enable the
guest to send commands authenticated with the key to the device,
even after she has been removed from the owner’s Home. Note
that this trick can be used to allow a malicious guest with the edit
permission (e.g, a tenant who may have the need to add his own
device) to gain stealthy control on a device already in the Home,
by simply removing the device and adding it back to place a new
key on its ACL. This flaw has been acknowledged by Apple and
assigned CVE-2020-9978.
PoC attack. To exploit the flaw above, we conducted an end-to-
end PoC attack on our Yale lock (with iM1 network module) [36].
First, using the Apple Home app we created a Home through an
iPad and added the Yale lock to the Home. Then the owner invited
another user (the adversary, e.g., a tenant) to the Home, and gave
him the right to edit accessories. So, to stealthily control the lock,
the adversary first removed it from the Home and then added it
back, during which no notification was sent to the owner’s Home
Session 5A: Control System SecurityCCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1304app. Specifically in our experiment, we captured the window before
the ownership transfer using Frida [16] to hook the processes apsd
and homed on a jailbroken iPhone to add a new public key (the
secret account) we generated to the lock’s ACL. As a result, later
even after the owner removed the adversary through the Home
app, he was still able to open the lock through the key.
Discussion. Without guidance, the coordination among multiple
DMCs on one device is found to be error-prone even when they
are managed by the same manufacturer. Particularly, our research
shows that even though the cloud-based DMC of HomeKit syn-
chronizes the user list to the ACL of a local DMC on a device, this
coordination does not go the other way around: any update on the
local ACL has never got to the cloud side, allowing a new account
added by the adversary to be unnoticed to the Home owner. The
problem could come from the different ways for these channels to
identify users. The Home app (cloud-based DMC) utilizes the user’s
Apple ID for access control, while the HAP library of the device
(local DMC) relies on the ed25519 public key to authenticate a user.
Since the key cannot be easily mapped to an Apple ID, updating
the ACL changes to the cloud becomes hard.
