While working on a way to address #101, it was discovered that some of the
functions, constants, and structures offered in go/doc/comment.go are useful
for parsing Go source code comments.
In particular, blocks(), block, op, opPara, opHead, and opPre.
Currently, consumers wanting to generate their own documentation or process Go
source code are left with duplicating the existing logic found in
go/doc/comment.go or adding special-case logic to that file itself for
specific formats (undesirable). I would like to suggest that the
aforementioned items be made public, or moved to a more suitable package for
re-use by others.
Doing so would make it easier to add support for the generation of new
documentation formats, such as manual pages, etc. and would likely provide a
cleaner result.
If the desire is to keep these items where they are today, I would rename them
as follows:
     blocks -> Blocks
     block -> Block
       block.op -> block.Op
       block.lines -> block.Lines
     op -> Op
     opPara -> OpPara
     opHead -> OpHead
     opPre -> OpPre
I am open to counter-suggestions as to how this logic should be exposed and I
am willing to perform the work requested.
