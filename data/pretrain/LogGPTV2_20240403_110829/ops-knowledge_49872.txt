User: Whenever I hit the up arrow in IPython, instead of getting history, I get this set of characters "^[[A" (not including the quotes).
Hitting the down arrow gives "^[[B", and tab completion doesn't work (just enters a tab).
How can I fix this?  It happens in both Terminal and iTerm.
Running OS X 10.5, Framework Python 2.5.4.  Error occurs in both ipython 0.8.3 and ipython 0.9.1.  pyreadline-2.5.1 egg is installed in both cases.
(edit: SSH-ing to another linux machine and using IPython there works fine.  So does running the normal "python" command on the OS X machine.)
Cheers,

Assistant: Solved by completely wiping all of site-packages.
I then re-installed Framework Python, re-installed setuptools, and easy_installed ipython FTW.
