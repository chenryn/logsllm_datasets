  * I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset
  * I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar
### Superset version
0.28.1  
This bug did appear somewhere in the past 12 months or so. It's not recent,
and is unrelated to the many changes that appeared in 0.28.
### Expected results
There should be only one tooltip instance
### Actual results
Sometimes a tooltip get "stuck". Very similar to bugs that were fixed by
#2096.

### Steps to reproduce
I've been unable to find a recipe for consistent reproduction, but the bug
happens to me multiple times per day.
