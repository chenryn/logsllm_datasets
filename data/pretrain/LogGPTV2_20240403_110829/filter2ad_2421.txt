ABSTRACT 
A  general  theory  of  trust  in  networks  of  humans  and  computers 
must be built on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of 
computational  trust.1  This  argument  is  motivated  by  increased 
participation 
networking, 
crowdsourcing,  human 
socio-economic 
protocols;  e.g.,  protocols  modeled  by  trust  and  gift-exchange 
games,  norms-establishing  contracts,  and  scams/deception.  We 
illustrate a class of interactive social protocols that relies both on 
trustworthy properties of commodity systems2 (e.g., verifiable end-
to-end trusted path) and participant trust, since on-line verification 
of  protocol  compliance  is  often  impractical;  e.g.,  it  can  lead  to 
undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user 
inconvenience. Trust  is captured  by  participant  preferences  (i.e., 
risk  and  betrayal  aversion)  and  beliefs  in  the  trustworthiness  of 
other  protocol  participants.  Both  preferences  and  beliefs  can  be 
enhanced whenever protocol non-compliance leads to punishment 
of  untrustworthy  participants;  i.e.,  it  seems  natural  that  betrayal 
aversion can be decreased and belief in trustworthiness increased 
by  properly  defined  punishment.  Similarly,  risk  aversion  can  be 
decreased and trustworthiness increased by feasible recovery from 
participant non-compliance. 
A  general  theory  of  trust  which  focuses  on  the establishment  of 
new trust relations where none were possible before would help 
create  new  economic  opportunities.  New  trust  relations  would 
increase 
to  users,  remove 
cooperation  barriers,  and  enable  the  “network  effect”  where  it 
really  matters;  i.e.,  at  the  application  level.  Hence,  it  seems 
important that security research should enable and promote trust-
enhancement  infrastructures  in  human  and  computer  networks; 
e.g., trust networks. Finally, we argue that a general theory of trust 
should  mirror  human  expectations  and  mental  models  without 
relying on false metaphors and analogies with the physical world.

Virgil D. Gligor received his B.Sc., M.Sc., 
and Ph.D. degrees from the University of 
California  at  Berkeley.  He  taught  at  the 
University of Maryland between 1976 and 
2007,  and  is  currently  a  Professor  of 
Electrical  and  Computer  Engineering  at 
Carnegie  Mellon  University  and  co-
Director  of  CyLab.  Over  the  past  thirty-
five  years,  his  research  interests  ranged 
from 
control  mechanisms, 
penetration analysis, and denial-of-service 
protection  to  cryptographic  protocols  and  applied  cryptography. 
Gligor was an editorial board member of several IEEE and ACM 
journals,  and  the  Editor  in  Chief  of  the  IEEE  Transactions  on 
Dependable  and  Secure  Computing.  He  received  the  2006 
National  Information  Systems  Security  Award  jointly  given  by 
NIST and NSA in the US, and the 2011 Outstanding Innovation 
Award  given  by  the  ACM  Special  Interest  Group  on  Security, 
Audit and Control.
