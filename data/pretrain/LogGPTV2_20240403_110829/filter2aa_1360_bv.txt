This free sendee allows query of an email address to identify any association with reported online scams. The 
standard search box allows for an exact search of any email address, but we can submit a wild card search via 
URL The following displays any ProtonMail email addresses in the scam database.
I am a bit hesitant to present this resource because it seems too good to be true. This "people data" collection 
company offers 1,000 free queries of their premium data sets to anyone, and they accept masked email addresses 
such as 33mail, Anonaddy, and Simple Login. We have seen other similar companies offer the same type of deal, 
such as Full Contact and Pipl, only to convert to a paid model without any type of trial. People Data Labs may 
be planning the same marketing strategy, but let's take advantage of the resource while it is available. You must 
create a free trial account at the website under the option of "Get /\PI Key". This will populate a unique key for 
your usage within the "Dashboard" of the page. Mine appeared similar to the following.
DomainBigData (domainbigdata.com) 
Full Name & Mailing Address 
Telephone Number
Eight Owned Domain Names 
Registrar and Host Details
This query reveals "PI:EMAIL" as a scammer from the website HackForums.net I 
always recommend a wild card search over a standard query, as it may catch misspellings or similar accounts 
associated with your target. While this site offers username and telephone search, I have found the results to be 
minimal. I only use it for email and Bitcoin queries.
Every domain name registration includes an email address associated with the site. While many people will use 
a privacy sendee to hide personal details, this is not always the case. Fortunately, many free sendees have been 
collecting domain registration details and offer queries of current and archived domain registration data. They 
x\dll identify domain names that were registered with the target email address entered. This is beneficial when 
you have a tech-sawy target that may have registered websites of which you are not aware. This also works on 
domains that no longer exist. As a test, 1 provided an email address of brad@noda.com. The following results 
identify the details found by each sendee. The use of affiliate IDs obtained by services such as Analyze ID will 
be explained during die domain instruction presented later.
Imitation
Email Provider
Email Addresses 269
While this is an obviously staged demo, the results are impressive. I have been able to convert a personal email 
address of a target into a full resume with social network profiles and cellular telephone number.
The results are presented as text in JSON format. The following is a partial summary. The full result included 
four pages of details. I found the following most beneficial.
"full_name": "scan thorne",
"first_name": "scan",
"birth_year": ”1990",
"linkedin_url": "linkedin.com/in/seanthorne", 
"linkedinjd": ”145991517",
"facebook_url": "facebook.com/deseanthorne",
"facebookjd": "1089351304",
"twitter_url": "twitter.com/seanthome5", 
"work-email": "PI:EMAIL", 
"mobile_phone": "+14155688415", 
"email address": "PI:EMAIL", 
"email address": "PI:EMAIL", 
"education": "university of Oregon",
If your target’s email address ends in gmail.com or yahoo.com, the identity of the email provider is quite obvious. 
However, business addresses and those with custom domain names do not notify you of the sendee that hosts 
the email. A domain’s email provider is the company listed in the domain's MX record. The email provider may 
be the same as the domain's hosting company, but could also be a separate company. You may need to know 
the email provider in order to issue a court order for content or subscriber data. You may simply want to 
document this information within your investigation for potential future use. Regardless of your needs, the 
following will obtain the email provider from almost any address.
This method can be replicated across practically all websites and services. I have used this technique to confirm 
that target email addresses are associated with sendees from Yahoo, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and many others. 
I have also identified real-world sendees in use by my target by attempting to create accounts with local cable, 
power, and water companies, supplying the target email account and being notified that the address was "already 
in use". Knowing the local cable provider of a suspect can seriously limit the geographical area where he or she 
could be residing. Be sure not to fully execute any account creations with your target email address. This method 
should only be used on an initial account creation screen, and never submitted.
The assumptions of email addresses can be valuable in discovering potential valid accounts, as mentioned earlier. 
Imitation of any target email addresses can reveal more details, and confirm association with online activities. 
Consider the following example. Your target email address is PI:EMAIL, and you want to know if he 
is a Mac or Windows user. You could first navigate to apple.com/account and attempt to make an Apple account 
with that address. If allowed to proceed past the first screen, then that user does not already have an account 
associated with the target address. If you are informed that the email address is already in use, then you know 
that your target is a Mac user, and that specific address controls the account. You could navigate to 
signup.Iive.com and attempt to create an account with the address. If denied, you know that your target is already 
a Windows user and that address controls the account
I have included this option within the search tools. However, you will need to replace "XXXX" with your own 
API key within die source code of the Email Tool page.

Similar to the previous IntelTcchniques search tools, I have created a custom email address search tool as 
previously explained in Section I. This is my most used tool, and the option which requires the most updates. 
As you find new or updated resources, you will likely want to keep this tool functioning 100 percent. Figure 
15.03 displays the version provided at the time of this writing.
Navigate to MX Toolbox (mxtoolbox.com) and enter the domain of the email address, such as [ 
The result should include a hostname and IP address. These identify the email provider for the target domain. 
In this example, die host is mxl.mailchannels.net. This tells me that Mail Channels is likely the email host. This 
technique helps me identify the email providers or hosts behind business email accounts. If 1 am trying to 
connect an individual to a shell company, this may associate the same small provider with each target. I believe 
even’ thorough OS1NT report should include a brief mention about the domain email provider. This should be 
checked as the investigation continues. Changing providers could be a sign of paranoia or intent to conceal 
evidence. Law enforcement can use this information in order to secure a proper search warrant.

This service appeared in late 2014 and conducts the same type of search as the previous competitors. The only 
slight advantage here is that the search is conducted faster than other sites. Additionally, you have a live hyperlink 
that will navigate to any identified accounts of the target.
KnowEm is one of the most comprehensive search websites for usernames. The main page provides a single 
search field which will immediately check for the presence of the supplied username on the most popular social 
network sites. A search for the username "inteltechniques" provides information about the availability of that 
username on the top 25 networks. If the network name is slightly transparent and the word "available" is stricken, 
that means there is a subject with a profile on that website using the supplied username. When the website is 
not transparent and the word "available" is orange and underlined, there is not a user profile on that site with 
the supplied username. For an online researcher, these "unavailable" indications suggest a visit to the site to 
locate that user's profile. The results could indicate that the target username is being used on Delicious and 
Twiner, but not Flickr or Tumblr. The link in the lower left comer of the result will open a new page that wall 
search over 500 social networks for the presence of the supplied username. These searches are completed by 
category, and the "blogging" category is searched automatically. Scrolling down this page will present 14 
additional categories with a button next to each category tide stating "check this category". This search can take 
some time. In a scenario involving a unique username, the search is well worth the time. Fortunately for us, and 
our tools, the following direct URLs can be used to save the steps for conducting a basic and advanced search.
Once you have identified a username for an online service, this information may lead to much more data. Active 
internet users often use the same username across many sites. For example, the user "amanda62002" on Myspace 
may be the same "amanda62002" on Twitter and an unknown number of other sites. When you identify an email 
address, you may now have the username of the target. If a subject uses PI:EMAIL as an email 
address, there is a good chance that he or she may use mpulido007 as a screen name on a number of sites. If the 
target has been an internet user for several years, this Gmail account was probably not the first email address 
used by the target. Searches for potential addresses of PI:EMAIL, PI:EMAIL, 
and PI:EMAIL may discover new information. Manual searching of this new username information 
is a good start. Keeping up with the hundreds of social websites available is impossible. Visiting the following 
services will allow you to search usernames across several websites, and will report links to profiles that you may 
have missed.
This sendee stands out a bit from the others in that it only provides actual profile results. It searches the supplied 
username for a presence on over 100 of the most popular websites and returns a list of identified profiles 
matching the target. While this sendee is the slowest of all options, this could be an indication of account 
verification for more accurate results. My frustration with this site is the requirements to conduct a full search.
Usernames 271
272 Chapter 16
You must re-enter the username several times and process through the various query submissions. Some pages 
do not present all options, so you must often return to the homepage to start over. Fortunately, we can submit 
our queries directly via URL as follows, which allows us to add these to our custom search tools presented at 
the end of the chapter.

This username search service provides a unique feature missing in the rest. It allows you to begin typing any 
partial username and it will immediately identify registered accounts within the top ten social networks. This 
could be beneficial when you are not sure of the exact name that your target is using. If your target has a Twitter 
username of Bazzell", the previous services will easily identify’ additional accounts that also possess this name. 
If you think that your target may be adding a number at the end of the username, it could take some time to 
search all of the possibilities. With NameVine, you can quickly change the number at the end of the username 
and get immediate results. It will search Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Wordpress, 
Blogger, and Github. It will also check for any ".com" domains that match. The benefit of this service is the 
speed of multiple searches. URL submission is as follows.
