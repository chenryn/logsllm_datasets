### Description
Currently, it appears that the `--replace_microseconds` flag is not available when triggering a DAG via the CLI in the file `airflow/airflow/cli/commands/dag_command.py` (line 145, commit 9337aa9):

```python
dag_id=args.dag_id, run_id=args.run_id, conf=args.conf, execution_date=args.exec_date
```

However, this argument is available in the `trigger_dag` function in `airflow/airflow/api/common/trigger_dag.py` (line 103, commit 9337aa9):

```python
def trigger_dag(
```

I propose adding the `--replace_microseconds` flag to the CLI, for example:

```bash
airflow dags trigger --replace_microseconds=False ...
```

I am willing to implement this change and would like to confirm if this is an acceptable modification.

### Use Case/Motivation
This enhancement would provide more flexibility and consistency between the API and CLI interfaces, allowing users to control the replacement of microseconds in the execution date when triggering a DAG.
