### Description
At the moment it seems you can't trigger a dag with the CLI with the flag
"replace_microseconds":
airflow/airflow/cli/commands/dag_command.py
Line 145 in 9337aa9
|  dag_id=args.dag_id, run_id=args.run_id, conf=args.conf,
execution_date=args.exec_date  
---|---  
However, this argument seems to be available in the "trigger_dag" function:
airflow/airflow/api/common/trigger_dag.py
Line 103 in 9337aa9
|  def trigger_dag(  
---|---  
The proposal is to add this flag, e.g: airflow dags trigger
--replace_microseconds=False ...
I'm willing to implement this, just wanted to check if this is a changed that
is okay
