3.3 Account Pricing & Availability
Prices through the course of our analysis range from
$0.01 to $0.20 per Twitter account, with a median cost of
$0.04 for all merchants. Despite the large overall span,
prices charged by individual merchants remain roughly
stable. Table 1 shows the variation in prices for six mer-
chants we tracked over the longest period of time. Price
hikes are a rare occurrence and no increase is more than
$0.03 per account. So long as miscreants have money
on hand, availability of accounts is a non-issue. Of the
orders we placed, merchants fulﬁlled 70% in a day and
90% within 3 days. We believe the stable pricing and
ready availability of fraudulent accounts is a direct result

3.4 Other Credentials For Sale
Our permission to purchase accounts is limited to Twitter
credentials, but many of the merchants we interact with
also sell accounts for Facebook, Google, Hotmail, and
Yahoo. We compare prices between web services, but
note that as we cannot vet non-Twitter credentials, some
prices may represent scams.
Facebook Prices for Facebook accounts range from
$0.45–1.50 per phone veriﬁed account (PVA) and $0.10
for non-PVA accounts. Phone veriﬁcation requires that
miscreants tie a SIM card to a newly minted Facebook
account and verify the receipt of a text message, the
complexities of which vastly increase the price of an ac-
count.3 For those sellers that advertise their registration
process, SIM cards originate from Estonia or Ukraine.
Google Prices for Google PVA accounts range from
$0.03–0.50 per account.
Hotmail Prices for Hotmail accounts cost $0.004 – 0.03
per account, a steep reduction over social networking or
PVA credentials. We see similar prices for a multitude of
web mail providers, indicating that email accounts are in
demand and cheaper to create.
Yahoo Yahoo accounts, like Hotmail, are widely avail-
able, with prices ranging from $0.006 – 0.015 per ac-
count.
3Advertisements that we encountered for phone veriﬁcation ser-
vices ranged in price from $.10 – $.15 per veriﬁcation for bulk orders
of 100,000 veriﬁcations, and $.25 per veriﬁcation for smaller orders.

Table 2: List of dishonest merchants that reaccessed and resold
credentials we purchased to other parties.
3.5 Merchant Fraud
Operating in the underground market is not without risk
of fraud and dishonesty on the part of account merchants.
For instance, eight of the merchants we contacted at-
tempted to sell us a total of 3,317 duplicate accounts.
One merchant even schemed to resell us the same 1,000
accounts three times. For those merchants willing to
honor their “48 hours of support”, we requested replace-
ment accounts for duplicates, bringing our account total
up to 121,027 unique credentials.
Apart from duplicate credentials, some merchants
were quick to resell accounts we purchased to third par-
ties. In order to detect resales, we coordinate with Twitter
to monitor all successful logins to accounts we purchase
after they come under our control. We denote these ac-
counts reaccessed. We repeat this same process to de-
tect new tweets or the formation of relationships. Such
behaviors should only occur when an account changes
hands to a spammer, so we denote these accounts as
resold. Such surreptitious behavior is possible because
we make a decision not to change the passwords of ac-
counts we purchase.
Table 2 shows the fraction of purchased accounts per
seller that merchants reaccessed and resold. A total of
10% of accounts in our dataset were logged into (either
by the seller or a third party; it is not possible to distin-
guish the two) within a median of 3 days from our pur-
chase. We ﬁnd that 6% of all accounts go on to be resold
in a median of 5 days from our purchase. This serves to
highlight that some merchants are by no means shy about
scamming potential customers.
4 Fraudulent Registration Analysis
Account merchants readily evade existing abuse safe-
guards to register thousands of accounts on a recurring
basis. To understand these failings, we delve into the
tools and techniques required to operate in the account
marketplace. We ﬁnd that merchants leverage thousands
of compromised hosts, CAPTCHA solvers, and access to
fraudulent email accounts. We identify what registration
barriers increase the price of accounts and summarize our
observations into a set of recommendations for how web
services can improve existing automation barriers to in-
crease the cost of fraudulent credentials in the future.
4.1 Dataset Summary
To carry out our analysis, we combine intelligence gath-
ered from the underground market with private data pro-
vided through a collaboration with Twitter. Due to the
sensitivity of this data, we strictly adhere to a data pol-
icy set down by Twitter, documented in Appendix A. In
total, we have the credentials for 121,027 purchased ac-
counts, each of which we annotate with the seller and
source of solicitation. Furthermore, we obtain access
to each account’s associated email address; login his-
tory going back one year including IP addresses and
timestamps; signup information including the IP and user
agent used to register the account; the history of each
account’s activities including tweeting or the formation
of social connections, if any; and ﬁnally whether Twit-
ter has ﬂagged the account as spam (independent of our
analysis).
4.2 Circumventing IP Defenses
Unique IP addresses are a fundamental resource for reg-
istering accounts in bulk. Without a diverse IP pool,
fraudulent accounts would fall easy prey to network-
based blacklisting and throttling [12, 18, 35]. Our anal-
ysis leads us to believe that account merchants either
own or rent access to thousands of compromised hosts
to evade IP defenses.
IP Address Diversity & Geolocation As a whole, mis-
creants registered 79% of the accounts we purchase from
unique IP addresses located across the globe. No single
subnet captures the majority of abused IPs; the top ten
/24 subnets account for only 3% of signup IPs, while
the top ten /16 subnets account for only 8% of regis-
trations. We provide a breakdown of geolocations tied
to addresses under the control of merchants in Table 3.
India is the most popular origin of registration, account-
ing for 8.5% of all fraudulent accounts in our dataset.

Other ‘low-quality’ IP addresses (e.g. inexpensive hosts
from the perspective of the underground market [4]) fol-
low in popularity. In summary, registrations come from
164 countries, the majority of which serve as the origin
of fewer than 1% of accounts in our dataset. However, in
aggregate, these small contributors account for 48.5% of
all registered accounts.
Merchants that advertise on blackhat forums or oper-
ate their own web storefronts have the most resources at
their disposal, registering all but 15% of their accounts
via unique IPs from hundreds of countries. Conversely,
merchants operating on Fiverr and Freelancer tend to op-
erate solely out of the United States or India and reuse
IPs for at least 30% of the accounts they register.
Long-term IP Abuse To understand the long-term abuse
of IP addresses, we analyze data provided by Twitter that
includes all registered accounts (not just our purchases)
from June, 2012 – April, 2013. From this, we select a
random sample of 100,000 unique IPs belonging to ac-
counts that Twitter has disabled for spamming (e.g. sus-
pended) and an equally sized sample of IPs used to regis-
ter legitimate Twitter accounts. We add a third category
to our sample that includes all the unique IP addresses
used by merchants to register the accounts we purchased.
For each of these IPs, we calculate the total number of
Twitter accounts registered from the same IP.
A CDF of our results, shown in Figure 2, indicates
merchants use the IP addresses under their control to reg-
ister an abnormal number of accounts. Furthermore, the
merchants we track are more cautious than other Twit-
ter spammers who register a larger volume of accounts
from a single IP address, making the merchants harder to
detect. In total, merchants use 50% of the IP addresses
under their control to register fewer than 10 accounts,

compared to 73% of IPs tied to legitimate users and only
26% for other spammers. We note that the small fraction
of legitimate IP addresses used to register thousands of
accounts likely belong to mobile providers or other mid-
dleboxes.
IP Churn & Pool Size In order to sustain demand for
new accounts without overextending the abuse of a single
IP address, merchants obtain access to tens of thousands
of IP addresses that change over time. Figure 3 shows
the fraction of accounts we purchase that appear from a
unique IP address4 as a function of time. We restrict our
analysis to the six merchants we track over the longest
period. Despite successive purchases of 1,000 accounts,
all but one seller maintains IP uniqueness above roughly
80% of registered accounts, indicating that the IPs avail-
able to merchants change over time.
