### Steps to Resolve

1. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with the new version of your project. Check for any known issues or updates in the libraries you are using.

2. **Increase Minimum SDK Version:**
   - Update your `minSdkVersion` in the `build.gradle` file to at least API level 26 to support `invoke-customs` and API level 24 to support `default interface methods`.

3. **Recompile with Lint Flags:**
   - Add the following flags to your `build.gradle` file to get more detailed information about deprecation and unchecked warnings:
     ```gradle
     android {
         compileOptions {
             options.compilerArgs += ["-Xlint:deprecation", "-Xlint:unchecked"]
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Clean and Rebuild:**
   - Clean and rebuild your project to ensure that all changes are applied correctly:
     ```sh
     flutter clean
     flutter pub get
     flutter run
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compilation issues and successfully build your project.
