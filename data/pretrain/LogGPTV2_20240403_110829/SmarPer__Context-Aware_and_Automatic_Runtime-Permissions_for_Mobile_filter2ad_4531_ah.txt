### Table III: Examples of Reported Situations Where Participants Made a Permission Decision for a Particular App and Data Type

#### WhatsApp
- **Contacts**
  - **Allow**: "Adding new contacts."
  - **Obfuscate**: "Used because otherwise the names of the contacts within the app were missing, it wasnâ€™t really convenient otherwise." 
  - **Deny**: "Never, because I thought that without contacts, WhatsApp is useless."
- **Location**
  - **Allow**: "For finding out the position of my friends while chatting."
  - **Obfuscate**: "I denied the access unless I wanted to use a feature of the application that required my location, like sharing my position with a friend within WhatsApp."
  - **Deny**: "Only selected when the pop-up was red (when it may cause the app to crash)."
- **Storage**
  - **Allow**: "To upload some picture."
  - **Obfuscate**: "Used most of the times, so that if the app needs to access some content that is in its folder."
  - **Deny**: "When not actively using the app."

#### TripAdvisor
- **Location**
  - **Allow**: "When I wanted to see my exact position relative to a bar or a restaurant."
  - **Obfuscate**: "When I wanted to see all the restaurants available near my house, but did not want to give the precise location where I live. When we do not want to give our exact location, but still need a service depending on our location."
  - **Deny**: "When I did not need location services."

#### AccuWeather
- **Location**
  - **Allow**: "I used it most of the time as I expected the functionality to be fine with coarse-grained location."
  - **Obfuscate**: "When I did not need location services."
  - **Deny**: "When I did not need location services."
