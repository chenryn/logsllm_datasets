Example Situations
(1) “Adding new contacts.”; (2) “Used because otherwise the
names of the contacts within the app were missing, it wasn’t
really convenient otherwise.”
(1) “I would use the obfuscation of the contacts most of the
times, because it gives the required information to Whatsapp
(phone number for example) while protecting my privacy.”
(1) “Never, because I thought that without contacts, Whatsapp
is useless.”
(1) “Only selected when the pop-up was red.” (when it may
cause the app to crash)
(1) “For ﬁnding out position of my friends while chatting.”
(1) “I denied the access unless I wanted to use a feature of the
applications that required my location, like sharing my position
with a friend within WhatsApp.”
(1) “To upload some picture.”
(1) “Used most of the times, so that if the app needs to access
some content that is in its folder.”
(1) “When not actively using the app.”
(1) “When I wanted to see my exact position relative to a bar
or a restaurant.”
(1) “When I wanted to see all the restaurants available near my
house, but do not wanted to give the precise location where I
live.”; (2) “When we do not want to give our exact location,
but still need a service depending on our location.”
(1) “When I did not need location services.”
(1) “I used it most of the time as I expected the functionality
to be ﬁne with coarse grained location.”
