### Largest App Market: Google Play

The total number of downloads for low-version apps could be even higher if third-party markets are included. If these low-version apps exhibit malicious behavior by abusing permissions, a large number of users could be affected, as all permissions are granted immediately after installation.

**Finding 2:** More than one-third (38.3%) of users are unaware of the behavioral differences in requesting permissions between low-version apps and apps supporting the runtime permission model.

Google Play only notifies users of the permissions requested by an app before installation through a dialog (Figure 3). In our interviews, we showed participants an example dialog for installing the "Camera FV-5 Lite" app from Google Play to explore their understanding of low-version apps' behavior. Seven out of ten Android participants mistakenly believed that the app would prompt for permissions again after installation, similar to apps with higher target SDK versions. This indicates that some users misunderstand that permissions are granted immediately upon installation for low-version apps.

In Survey 1, we validated this observation with a larger population. Over one-third (38.3%) of Android respondents incorrectly believed that the app would request permissions again post-installation. This suggests that many users cannot distinguish between low-version apps and those supporting runtime permissions based on Google Play's notification dialog. While the majority of respondents (80.0%) knew they could revoke granted permissions, only one PerChecker user with a low-version app actually revoked permissions, indicating that this feature is underutilized in real-world scenarios.

### Recent App Market Policy Changes

During our study, Google Play began limiting the target version of newly uploaded apps [11]. Starting from November 2019, new apps and updates must target Android 9 or above. This policy both confirms and mitigates the issue of low-version apps but does not completely eliminate it. First, the policy applies only to newly uploaded apps, leaving many existing apps still using low-version SDKs. Second, low-version apps can still be found on manufacturer app stores (e.g., Google Play) and third-party stores (e.g., F-Droid) [6].

For low-version apps, Android prompts users to decide whether to revoke dangerous permissions when the app launches for the first time, starting with Android 10 [22]. However, this does not fully resolve the issue. First, making decisions before using the app still lacks the context provided by the runtime permission model. Second, the adoption of Android 10 may take a long time due to Android fragmentation [1], potentially impacting users whose OSes are not updated.

**Answer to RQ1:** Low-version apps remain prevalent three years after the introduction of the runtime permission model. Additionally, many users mistakenly believe that low-version apps still need to request permissions at runtime.

### Runtime Permission Comprehension

In this section, we investigate:
1. Whether users can accurately infer the scope of permission groups from system-provided messages in permission dialogs.
2. How often users review their permission settings and whether reviewing these settings helps them.
3. For iOS, how users perceive app-provided descriptions in permission request dialogs.

#### Permission Groups Comprehension

In Survey 1, respondents answered four questions related to the scope of permission groups, as described in §3.3. The results are detailed in Table 6.

**Finding 3:** Only a small percentage (6.1%) of survey respondents correctly inferred the accurate scope of permission groups from the system dialog messages. Users often:
1. Mistakenly include choices seemingly correlated to a permission group.
2. Exclude correct choices that are difficult to infer from the system descriptions.

Approximately 6.1% of respondents selected all correct usages of the permission groups in the comprehension test. Other respondents fell into two categories:
- One category (34.4% for Android and 21.2% for iOS) correctly responded but underestimated the scope of permission groups when multiple correct choices were available (Table 7).
- The other category (over 60% for both Android and iOS) overestimated the scope and included incorrect choices in their answers.

We further analyzed the most common incorrect choices made by more than 20% of respondents. One observation is that the descriptions and names of permission groups mislead users, causing them to select seemingly-correlated wrong choices. For example, about 37.3% of users believed that granting Camera permission allows apps to read pictures and videos, which is controlled by the Storage permission group on Android or Photos on iOS. On Android, 38.5% of respondents thought that the Call Log permission group allows apps to read contacts, which is controlled by a different permission group [21].

These misunderstood permission groups are designed to serve relevant functionalities, but the explanations provided are often misleading. Full results are available at [10].

|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1                | Camera           | 55.7%                    |
| 2                | Location         | 80.5%                    |
| 3                | Call Logs        | 80.5%                    |
| 5+               | Sensor, Calendar, Microphone, SMS, Contact, Storage, Phone | 80.5%                    |

This data highlights the need for clearer and more precise permission descriptions to help users better understand the scope of permissions they are granting.
