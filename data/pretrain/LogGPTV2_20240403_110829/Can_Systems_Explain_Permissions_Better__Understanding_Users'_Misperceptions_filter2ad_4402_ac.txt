biggest app market, Google Play. The actual number of total
downloads for the low-version apps can be even larger if some
third-party markets are included. If low-version apps exhibit
malicious behavior by abusing some of the permissions, a
large number of users can be potentially affected, since all the
permissions are granted immediately after installation.
Finding 2: More than one-third (38.3%) of users are not
aware of the behavioral differences in requesting permis-
sions between low-version apps and apps supporting the
runtime permission model.
In dealing with the low-version apps, Google Play only
notiﬁes users of the permissions requested by the app before
its installation with a dialog (Figure 3). In the interviews, we
showed the participants an example dialog when installing
the app “Camera FV-5 Lite” from Google Play and explored
if they could infer the different behaviors of low-version apps.
Seven out of the ten Android participants mistakenly believed
that the app would prompt permission requests again after
installation - just like apps with higher target SDK versions,
which shows that some users misunderstand that permissions
will be not granted upon installation for the low-version apps.
In survey 1, we validated this observation in a larger pop-
ulation. More than one-third (38.3%) Android respondents
mistakenly believed that the app would ask again for the per-
missions. This means that many users cannot infer the differ-
ence between low-version apps and other apps supporting run-
time permission from Google Play’s notiﬁcation dialog. For
permission management for low-version apps, the majority of
respondents (80.0%) correctly knew that they could revoke
granted permissions. However, among all PerChecker users
with low-version apps installed, only one of them actually
revoked permissions for a low-version app, which suggests
the ability to revoke permissions for low-version apps have
not been well utilized by the users in real-world scenarios.
Discussion on recent app market policy change. While we
were conducting our study, Google Play began to limit the
target version of newly uploaded apps [11]: staring from Nov.
2019, new apps and app updates need to target Android 9 or
above. This both conﬁrmed and mitigated the issue of low-
version apps. But the issue has not been completely eliminated
even with this limit. First, the policy only applies to the newly
uploaded apps; for a large number of existing apps, they still
use low-version SDK. Second, low-version apps can still exist
on manufacturer app stores (e.g. Google Play) and third-party
app stores (e.g. F-Droid) [6].
For low-version apps, Android asks users to decide to re-
voke dangerous permissions or not when the app launches
for the ﬁrst time since Android 10 [22]. However, this can-
not completely eliminate the issue. First, making decisions
before using the app still lacks the runtime context even in
the runtime permission model. Second, the adoption of An-
droid 10 may take a long time due to the problem of Android
fragmentation [1]. These users may still be impacted by apps
with low-version SDK if their OSes are not updated.
Answer to RQ1: Low-version apps are still prevalent three
years after the introduction of the runtime permission model.
Besides, many users mistakenly believe that the low-version
apps still need to request permissions at runtime.
5 Runtime Permission Comprehension
In this section, we investigate (1) whether users can pre-
cisely infer the scope of permission groups from the system-
provided messages in permission dialogs, and (2) how often
users review their permission settings and whether reviewing
permission settings can help them. As for iOS, the permission
request dialogs mix system-deﬁned permission descriptions
with explanations provided by apps. We also investigated how
iOS users perceive app-provided descriptions in the dialogs.
5.1 Permission Groups Comprehension
In our survey 1 on permission comprehension, respondents
need to answer four questions related to the scope of per-
mission groups as described in §3.3. The details of survey 1
results are shown in Table 6.
Finding 3: Only a small percentage (6.1%) of survey re-
spondents can correctly infer the accurate scope of permis-
sion groups from messages in the system dialogs. Users can
both (1) mistakenly include choices seemingly correlated to
a permission group, and (2) exclude correct choices which
are hard to infer from the system descriptions.
Around one-in-twenty (6.1%) respondents can select all
correct usages of the permission groups in the comprehension
test. Other respondents can be divided into two categories.
One category of users (34.4% for Android and 21.2% for
iOS) can respond correctly but underestimate the scope of
permission groups when there are multiple correct choices,
as shown in Table 7. The other category (more than 60% for
both Android and iOS) overestimates the scope and includes
wrong choices in their answers.
We further analyzed the most common wrong choices that
are made by more than 20% of respondents in the comprehen-
sion questions. One observation is that the descriptions and
names of the permission groups mislead users and cause them
to select seemingly-correlated wrong choices. For example,
around one-in-three (37.3%) of users believe after granting
the Camera permission, apps can also read the pictures and
videos, which is controlled by permission group Storage on
Android or Photos on iOS. On Android, two-in-ﬁve (38.5%)
of respondents think that apps can read contacts with the Call
Log permission group, which is controlled by another permis-
sion group [21]. These misunderstood permission groups are
designed to serve relevant functionalities, but the explanations
