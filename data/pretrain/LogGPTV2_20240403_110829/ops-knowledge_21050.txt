Question: Analyze the following Java code snippet from a web application that logs failed input parsing attempts: 

String val = request.getParameter("val");
try { int value = Integer.parseInt(val); }
catch (NumberFormatException e) { log.info("Failed to parse val = " + val); }

Which vulnerability does this code snippet most likely introduce?
"A": "SQL Injection due to concatenation of unsanitized input in a query.",
"B": "Improper output neutralization for logs, allowing log forging through untrusted input.",
"C": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) because of unescaped user input being rendered in the web interface.",
"D": "Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on the input value."
Answer: B
