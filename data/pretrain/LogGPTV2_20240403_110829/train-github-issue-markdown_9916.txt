### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 5.0.4
  * **Operating System:**
    * Windows 10
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * None
### Expected Behavior
webContents.print(option, callback) can work with parameters.
### Actual Behavior
webContents.print() will work without parameters.  
But it doesn't respond when adding parameters, no errors, and no callback. If
the window is closed at this time, a "false" callback will be made.
`printPage.webContents.print() // may work`
`printPage.webContents.print({silent: true}, (e) => console.log(e)) // no
respond`
I'm not sure if this is a BUG, and I still want to find a solution. Thank!!!
