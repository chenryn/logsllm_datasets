User: If so, What is the advantage ? (sure it will avoid restarting webserver). But isn't it a perfomance bottleneck? For production, is it possible to make web2py run directly from bytecode skipping interpreting stage (Caching) (except for the first request) ?
Assistant: I don't know web2py particularly, but it runs via WSGI like most other Python frameworks. This means that code is only interpreted when the process starts, and is otherwise kept in memory. Processes are dynamically started and killed by the web server itself, but usually last for multiple requests.
In any case, the Python interpreter usually creates a byte-code file, .pyc, when code is first read. This works in a webserver environment just as it does anywhere else.
Finally, however, it is generally considered that code parsing is not particularly a bottleneck - the conversion to bytecode is pretty quick. In a web application, your bottleneck is almost certainly elsewhere (probably in the connection to the database).
