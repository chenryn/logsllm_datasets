  * VSCode Version: 0.10.12-alpha
  * OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04
  * Debugging using Microsoft cpp debugger, but will happen in any "stop-all" style debugger.
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Compile following C++ code
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    using namespace std;
    #define NUM_THREADS 5
    void *PrintHello(void *threadid)
    long tid;
    tid = (long)threadid; //set a breakpoint here
    cout << "Hello World! Thread ID, " << tid << endl;
    pthread_exit(NULL);
    }
    int main()
    {
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    int rc;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) { //set a breakpoint here
    cout << "main() : creating thread, " << i << endl;
    rc = pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL,
    PrintHello, (void *)i);
    if (rc) {
    cout << "Error:unable to create thread," << rc << endl;
    exit(-1);
    }
    }
    pthread_exit(NULL);
    }
  1. Set two breakpoints in the lines with comments "//set a breakpoint here"
  2. press F5 3~5 times
  3. Notice, that if a breakpoint or step causes the threads to switch, the UI does not indicate which thread is currently stepping. Multiple callstacks may be displayed, which can be confusing.
