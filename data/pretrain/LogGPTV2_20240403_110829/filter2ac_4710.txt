**ATT&CK ID:** G0018  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** admin@338

The threat actors known as **admin@338** utilized the following commands after successfully exploiting a system with the **LOWBALL** malware. These commands were employed to gather information about files and directories on the compromised machine:

- `dir c:\ >> %temp%\download`
- `dir "c:\Documents and Settings" >> %temp%\download`
- `dir "c:\Program Files\" >> %temp%\download`
- `dir d:\ >> %temp%\download`

These commands append the directory listings of specific folders (including the root of the C: drive, the "Documents and Settings" folder, the "Program Files" folder, and the D: drive) to a file named `download` in the temporary directory (`%temp%`). This method allows the attackers to collect detailed information about the file structure and contents, which can be used for further malicious activities.
