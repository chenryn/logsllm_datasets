User: How to use Ansible to automate the configuration of a web server's basic environment and package installation?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Ansible to automate the configuration of a web server's basic environment and software package installation: 1. Install Ansible and configure the host list file - Install Ansible on the control machine - Create a host list file, specify the IP address or domain name of the web server 2. Writing Ansible Playbook - Creates a YAML file that defines tasks to be performed on the web server - defining tasks includes configuring the environment (e.g. installing required packages, setting firewall rules), and deploying the web application (e.g. cloning repositories, Install dependencies, start services) - define variables for tasks to make playbooks reusable or applicable to multiple web servers Task Through the above steps, you can use Ansible to automatically configure the basic environment of a web server and install software packages.
