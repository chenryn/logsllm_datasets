#### Dredown
At [Dredown](https://www.dredown.com), you can download videos from all major video-sharing sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Keek, Twitter, Twitch, Vimeo, Vevo, Tumblr, and more.

For additional websites that offer video content downloads, visit [Deturl](http://deturl.com).

#### Video/Audio Converter
During your search for videos, you may encounter cases where you cannot open a specific video or audio file due to its format. To address this, you can use software to convert the file into a supported format. Here are some recommended tools:

- **HandBrake** ([handbrake.fr](https://handbrake.fr)): An open-source program for processing multimedia files, including DVDs and Blu-ray discs, into a readable format on supported devices. It also supports encoding different audio file types.
- **Convert2mp3** ([convert2mp3.net](http://www.convert2mp3.net)): An online service that converts videos with various file formats into MP3 and other audio file formats.

**Warning:** Many web extensions are available for downloading and converting media files. However, we recommend avoiding such add-ons as they can access your browser's web history, potentially leading to privacy invasions, especially in sensitive cases.

To ensure security when using online services, follow these precautions:
- **Do not provide personal information** (e.g., email, phone number) when using these services.
- **Access such services over a VPN connection** (or use the Tor Browser).

### Chapter 4: Search Engine Techniques

#### File Search Tools
After collecting a large number of files during an online investigation, finding specific information can be challenging. All operating systems have a built-in search function, but they often lack advanced features and can be time-consuming, especially on older hardware. For example, Windows' background search indexing can slow down the computer, particularly on systems with limited RAM.

Efficiently searching through collected files is a crucial part of OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) analysis. Automating the search process can save significant time compared to manual searches.

To speed up file searches, create an index of your stored files. This works similarly to how search engines operate. When you query Google, it searches its index database and retrieves relevant URLs. Similarly, you need an index of all file names and their locations on your hard drives. This index will be stored in a database, allowing you to query the database instead of manually searching through all files and folders.

While Windows can create such an index, there are better programs with more advanced search features:

- **Locate32** ([locate32.cogit.net](http://locate32.cogit.net)): On first run, go to the File menu and select "Update Databases" to create a database containing all file and folder names along with their locations.
- **Everything** ([voidtools.com](http://www.voidtools.com)): A lightweight program that automatically creates an index database upon start. It can index files very quickly (one minute for 1,000,000 files) and supports various search methods like Boolean, regex, wildcards, file types, and macros.
- **FileSeek (Free Edition)** ([fileseek.ca](https://www.fileseek.ca)): Uses multithreading technology to speed up searches and can synchronize results across different computers. It also supports searching within file contents using regular expressions.
- **Open Semantic Search** ([opensemanticsearch.org](https://www.opensemanticsearch.org)): An open-source search engine with integrated research tools for easier searching, monitoring, analytics, discovery, and text mining of large document sets. It can be installed on your own server and is suitable for teams conducting OSINT research on large datasets.

#### Summary
In this chapter, we covered basic and advanced search engine techniques for locating information online. While most of the focus was on the surface web, we also discussed techniques for extracting data from the deep web and provided links to various deep web repositories.

Major search engines allow users to search for multimedia content like videos and images. Specialized search engines for FTP servers and multimedia content can return even more results. Remember that images and videos from the web can contain useful metadata, which should be retrieved and investigated using specialized tools to ensure their authenticity.

In the next chapter, we will continue our discussion of online search techniques, focusing on using different techniques and services to find information about specific people using social media sites and other specialized people-searching engines.

### Chapter 5: Social Media Intelligence

In today’s digital age, it is rare to meet someone connected to the internet who does not have at least one social media account. People use social media to socialize, play games, shop, communicate, and seek information. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Google have become integral parts of our lives, with hundreds of millions of people spending considerable time on these platforms daily.

#### Global Usage of Social Media
- As of October 2017, the total worldwide population was 7.6 billion, with 3.5 billion having internet access, and 3.03 billion of those having an active presence on one or more social media platforms.
- Each internet user has an average of seven social media accounts.
- Facebook had 2.07 billion monthly active users as of Q3 2017.
- Twitter had 330 million monthly active users as of Q3 2017.
- LinkedIn had 500 million users in 200 countries as of April 2017.

Social media sites provide a wealth of information for investigations, including personal details, connections, political views, religion, ethnicity, country of origin, personal images and videos, marital status, addresses, frequently visited locations, social activities, work history, education, important dates, and social interactions.

#### Information Gathering
- **Intelligence Services**: 90% of useful information comes from public sources (OSINT).
- **Law Enforcement**: Use social media to fight crimes, track suspects, and gather evidence.
- **Corporate World**: Employers, insurance companies, and banks use social media for background checks and market intelligence.

#### Legal Considerations
- **Court Order**: Required to gather information about a specific user.
- **Public Information**: Can be acquired without a permit if it is publicly available.

#### What Is Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT)?
SOCMINT refers to information gathered from social media platforms, which can be either public or private. There is a debate about whether social media information is considered OSINT, but security experts generally classify it as such.

#### Types of Social Media Content
- **Post/Comment**: Text, images, videos, and URLs.
- **Reply**: Text, images, videos, or URLs in response to another user’s post.
- **Multimedia Content**: Videos, images, live streams.
- **Social Interactions**: Friend requests, connections.
- **Metadata**: Date, time, geolocation, device type.

#### Classifications of Social Media Platforms
- **Social Networking**: Facebook, LinkedIn.
- **Photo Sharing**: Instagram, Flickr.
- **Video Sharing**: YouTube.
- **Blogs**: WordPress, Blogger.
- **Microblogging**: Twitter, Tumblr.
- **Forums**: Reddit, Quora.
- **Social Gaming**: Facebook Games.
- **Social Bookmarking**: Atavi, Pinterest, Pocket.
- **Product/Service Review**: Websites for feedback on products and services.
