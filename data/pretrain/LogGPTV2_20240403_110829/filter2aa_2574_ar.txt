At https://www.dredown.com, you can download videos from all major video-sharing 
sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Keek, Twitter, Twitch, Vimeo, Vevo, Tumblr, 
and more.
You can find other websites for downloading video contents online at  
http://deturl.com.
 Video/Audio Converter
You may encounter cases—during your search for videos—where you cannot open a 
specific video/audio file because of its file format type. To counter such issues, you can 
use software to convert a video file from its current file format to another one so it can 
work on supported devices.
• 
HandBrake (https://handbrake.fr): This is an open source 
program for processing multimedia files and any DVD or Blu-ray 
disc into a readable format on supported devices; it also supports 
encoding different audio file types.
• 
Convert2mp3 (www.convert2mp3.net): This is an online service that 
converts videos with different file formats into MP3 and other audio 
file formats.
Warning! there are many web extensions already available to download/convert 
media files from the internet. however, we prefer not to use such add-ons as 
they can gain access to our browser web history, and this may result in a privacy 
invasion, especially when working on sensitive cases that require secrecy.
Using online services should be more secure when you use these two precaution 
measures:
A.  Do not supply information when using this service (e.g., e-mail, phone  
number, etc.)
B. access such services over a Vpn connectio n (or using the tor Browser).

 File Search Tools
After collecting a large number of files as part of your online investigation, you may 
have difficulty finding one specific piece of information when you need it. All operating 
systems have a built-in search function to locate files and folders on the computer drive. 
However, they lack an advanced search feature like those offered by some dedicated 
tools. They are also known to be time-consuming especially when using the Windows 
search feature on computers with old hardware. (Windows performs background 
search indexing and consumes a considerable amount of system RAM because it 
performs thousands of write operations on the hard drive, resulting in slowing down the 
computer; this problem appears clearly on Windows Vista.) 
Being able to search through the files you have collected is an integral part of your 
OSINT analyzing skills. Your ability to find files fast through automated search will save 
considerable time than when conducting such searches manually.
To speed up file searches on your computer, you need to have an index of your stored 
files. The idea is like how people query search engines. When someone queries Google 
for a search term, Google will search for this term in its index database. When a match 
is found, the URLs associated with the index search results get retrieved and displayed 
on the user’s browser. Searching for files on computers is similar. You need to have an 
index of all file names and their locations on your computer hard drives. The list (index) 
will get stored in a database. Whenever you search for something, you will query the 
database instead of asking Windows to search manually across all files and folders on the 
drive. This will effectively give you the fastest results, especially if you have millions of 
files on your computer hard drive.
Windows can create such an index to locate files faster. However, there are better 
programs that can do the job better and have more advanced search features. These are 
some of them:
• 
Locate32 (http://locate32.cogit.net): Upon the first run, you 
need to go to the File menu and select Update Databases. This will 
create the database file that contains the names of all files/folders 
along with their locations on all hard drives (see Figure 4-36).
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS

• 
Everything (www.voidtools.com): This is a small program that 
consumes very little system resources; it creates an index database 
automatically upon start and can index files very fast (it needs one 
minute to index 1,000,000 files) and can search within file contents. 
You can search using different methods such as Boolean, regex, 
wildcards, file types, and macros.
• 
FileSeek (free edition) (https://www.fileseek.ca): This uses 
multithreading technology to speed up searches and can synchronize 
search results across different computers in addition to searching 
within the file’s contents using regular expressions.
• 
Open Semantic Search (https://www.opensemanticsearch.org): 
This open source search engine comes with integrated research 
tools for easier searching, monitoring, analytics, discovery, and text 
mining of heterogenous and large document sets and news. It can 
be installed on your own server or enterprise server and comes with 
plenty of excellent search features. It is suitable for teams conducting 
OSINT research on a large volume of datasets.

 Summary
In this chapter, we thoroughly covered how to use basic and advanced search engine 
techniques to locate information online. Although most of your work in this chapter was 
focused on retrieving data from the surface web, we showed techniques for extracting 
data from the deep web and provided direct links to a variety of deep web repositories to 
retrieve information from it.
Major search engines allow its users to search for multimedia content such as 
videos and images. However, there are specialized search engines for FTP servers and 
multimedia contents that can return even more results. Bear in mind that images and 
videos retrieved from the Web can contain useful information associated with them—
known as metadata—that should be retrieved first. These files must also be investigated 
using specialized tools to make sure that they have not been manipulated in any way 
before considering them valid.
In the next chapter, we will continue our discussion of online search techniques, but 
there we will focus on using different techniques and services to find information about 
specific people using social media sites and other specialized people-searching engines.

CHAPTER 5
Social Media Intelligence
In today’s digital age, it is rare to meet a person who is connected to the Internet who 
doesn’t have an account on one or more social media sites. People use social sites to 
socialize, play games, shop, communicate online, and seek information about anything 
you can imagine. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Google have become 
integral parts of our lives, and hundreds of millions of people spend considerable 
amounts of time on these platforms daily.
Check out these statistics about the global usage of social media sites:
• 
As of October 2017, the total worldwide population was 7.6 billion.i 
Of those, 3.5 billion people have an Internet connection, and 3.03 
billion of those connected users have an active presence on one or 
more social media platform.ii
• 
Each Internet user has an average of seven social media accounts.iii
• 
Facebook has 2.07 billion monthly active users as of the third quarter 
of 2017.iv
• 
As of the third quarter of 2017, Twitter has 330 million monthly active 
users.
• 
As of April 2017, LinkedIn has 500 million users in 200 countries.v
Social media sites open numerous opportunities for any investigation because 
of the vast amount of useful information that can be found on them. For example, 
you can get a great deal of personal information about any person worldwide by just 
checking this person’s Facebook page. Such information often includes the person of 
interest’s connections on Facebook, political views, religion, ethnicity, country of origin, 
personal images and videos, spouse name (or marital status), home and work addresses, 
frequently visited locations, social activities (e.g., sports, theater, and restaurant visits), 
204
work history, education, important event dates (such as birth date, graduation date, 
relationship date, or the date when left/start a new job), and social interactions. This 
can all be found in one Facebook profile, for example. Facebook also helps an outside 
observer to understand how a particular Facebook user perceives life by just checking 
the user’s current activities and social interactions.
Many estimates show that 90 percent of useful information acquired by intelligence 
services comes from public sources (OSINT), and the rest comes from traditional covert 
spying intelligence. Security services gather information in bulk from social sites to 
gain insight about possible future events worldwide and to profile people on a national 
scale.
Aside from intelligence gathering, law enforcement uses social media sites as 
investigative resources to fight crimes. For instance, checking a suspect’s Facebook 
page—or his relatives’ and friends' pages—may reveal important information about a 
criminal case. Sometimes the suspect could be anonymous, but the police could have 
a picture of him taken by surveillance cameras. In such cases, police use social media 
sites to engage the public in identifying suspects. Social sites can also be used to track 
and locate suspects in addition to understanding their behaviors. However, bear in mind 
that using the information gathered from social media sites in a legal case is generally 
allowed under these two conditions:
• 
When acquiring permission from a court to gather information about 
a specific user, a court order is sent to the intended social media site 
to hand the information to authorities officially.
• 
If the information is available publicly (e.g., public posts, images, or 
videos), then law enforcement can acquire it without a permit, which 
is the essence of the OSINT concept.
Intelligence gathered from social media can also be useful in the corporate world. 
For instance, employers can conduct a background check about prospective candidates 
before offering them a vacancy. The same applies to insurance companies and banks 
before offering some services (e.g., an insurance contract or a bank loan) to their clients. 
Global companies—operating in different countries—need to have some form of 
intelligence about new markets before entering them. Indeed, social media exploitation 
has become integrated into the majority of businesses to support the decision-making 
process.
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
205
Warning! Using the information published on social sites to acquire intelligence 
about a prospect employee should be handled carefully in accordance with the law 
to avoid triggering a claim of discrimination by the prospective employee.
In this chapter, we will show investigators how to find information on social 
media sites. There are a plethora of tools and online services to dive beyond basic the 
search functions available for each social site. We will demonstrate how to use such 
services/tools to aggregate information about any target online, but before we begin 
our discussion about how to retrieve information from the most popular social media 
sites, we’ll first explain the term social media intelligence and differentiate between the 
different types of social media sites currently available.
 What Is Social Media Intelligence?
Social media intelligence (SOCMINT) refers to the information gathered from social 
media platforms. The resources available on social media sites can be either open 
to the public (e.g., public posts on Facebook) or private. Private information cannot 
be accessed without proper permission (e.g., Facebook private messages or posts 
shared with friends). There is a debate between privacy advocates and other security 
experts about whether information available on social media sites is OSINT. Although 
the majority of social media sites require their users to register before accessing site 
contents in full, many surveys show that social media users expect to have some form 
of privacy for their online activities (even when posting content with public access). 
However, security experts generally consider information shared on social media sites as 
belonging to the OSINT domain because it is public information shared on public online 
platforms and thus can be exploited for different purposes.
Note! Many U.S. states (about 25 states in 2017vi) imposed different restrictions 
regarding employers’ access to workers’ (applicants or employees) social media 
accounts. however, this does not mean that your social media interactions will not 
get observed—secretly—in one way or another.
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
206
There are different types of social media sites, but before listing them, let’s first see 
what content people can publish on social media platforms to get to know the types of 
information that you can expect to gather.
 Social Media Content Types
Aside from browsing the content, people interact with social media sites for different 
purposes. The following are the general interactions used across different social media 
sites:
• 
Post/comment: People access social sites to post or write paragraphs 
of text that can be seen by other users. Each social platform has its 
own name. On Twitter it’s called a tweet, while on Facebook it’s called 
a post or a comment when commenting on other user post. This text 
can be combined with images, videos, and URLs. See Figure 5-1 for a 
sample LinkedIn post.
• 
Reply: This is a text message (can also be an image, video, or URL) 
that replies to another user’s post, update status, or comment.
Figure 5-1. Sample post on LinkedIn, which can be associated with either an 
image or video. The same post can also be shared on Twitter (which requires 
connecting your Twitter account with your LinkedIn profile).
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
207
• 
Multimedia content (images and videos): Multimedia is popular; 
a user can upload a video or image as a part of their post. Many 
social platforms allow their users to upload multiple images/videos 
to form an album. Live streams also are available on many social 
platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. This feature allows a user 
to broadcast live videos and display the recording on their profiles for 
later viewing.
• 
Social interactions: This is the essence of social media sites, where 
people get connected online by sending/responding to friend 
requests sent by their friends, work and study colleagues, roommates, 
neighbors, family members, and favorite celebrities or actors. The set 
of online relationships forms what is known as social networking.
• 
Metadata: The results from the sum of user interactions with the 
social platform. Examples include the date and time when a video/
image was uploaded, the date and time when a friend request was 
accepted, geolocation data—if enabled—of the uploaded multimedia 
file or post, and the type of device used to upload the contents 
(mobile or a standard computer).
Online investigators want to acquire all these content types—if possible—when 
conducting their investigations. This ability to do this depends on the privacy control 
level set by each user when publishing posts/updates online. For example, it is not 
possible to see other people’s updates on Facebook (see Figure 5-2) if they restrict a 
post’s visibility to some friend circles or set it to “Only me.”
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
208
Bear in mind that information shared on social media sites with family or friend 
circles cannot be guaranteed to remain private. For example, when you share a personal 
photo of yourself with a friend and this friend shares this photo in a public status, then 
others can see your personal photo even though you shared it privately at first.
 Classifications of Social Media Platforms
Many people use the terms social media and social networking interchangeably to refer 
to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and related social platforms. This is not absolutely 
wrong, but it is not accurate because social media is the main umbrella that contains 
other categories like “social networking” that holds sites like Facebook. Social media 
contains other types that have similar roles in facilitating interactions between people 
online.
The following are the main social media types classified according to function:
• 
Social networking: This allows people to connect with other people 
and businesses (brands) online to share information and ideas.  
The most obvious examples of this type are Facebook and LinkedIn. 
(The latter is more focused on the corporate world but shares many 
similar features with Facebook.)

• 
Photo sharing: Such websites are dedicated to sharing photos between 
users online. The most popular ones are Instagram (https://www.
instagram.com) and Flicker (https://www.flickr.com).
• 
Video sharing: Such websites are dedicated to sharing videos, 
including live video broadcasts. The most popular one is https://
www.youtube.com. Sharing multimedia content is feasible via social 
networking sites such as Facebook (which offers live video broadcast) 
and LinkedIn. However, video-sharing sites—like YouTube.com—
are dedicated to sharing multimedia content and contain a limited 
amount of text within them (mainly allowing users to comment on 
the uploaded videos).
• 
Blogs: This is a type of informational website containing a set of 
posts—belonging to one topic or subject—organized in descending 
order according to the publish date. A first blogs were based on 
static HTML content and created/operated by one author. With 
the advance of web publishing tools and the emergence of Web 
2.0 technology—which simplifies posting content online by 
nontechnical users—blog usage has been boosted and become 
available to anyone who wants to have a place online to share his/her 
ideas. The most popular blogging platforms are WordPress (https://
wordpress.com) and Blogger (https://www.blogger.com), which is 
powered by Google.
• 
Microblog: This allows users to publish a short text paragraph (which 
can be associated with an image or video) or a link (URL) to be shared 
with other audience online. The most popular microblogs are Twitter 
(https://twitter.com) and Tumbler (https://www.tumblr.com).
• 
Forums (message board): This is one of the oldest types of social 
media. It allows users to share ideas, opinions, expertise, information, 
and news and discuss it with other users in a form of posted messages 
and replies. Forums usually come organized into topics. The most 
popular ones now are Reddit (https://www.reddit.com) and Quora | 
(https://www.quora.com).

• 
Social gaming: This refers to playing games online with other players 
in different locations. Social games allow users to collaborate from 
different parts around the world to form teams or to challenge other 
individuals/groups. Facebook has many social games that can be 
played within a user’s web browser; you can check them out at 
https://www.facebook.com/games.
• 
Social bookmarking: These websites offer a similar function to your web 
browser’s typical bookmark. However, they allow you to do this online 
and share your Internet bookmarks among your friends in addition 
to adding annotations and tags to your saved bookmarks. Many 
bookmarking services allow their users to sync the bookmarks with 
any device or browser, making your bookmarks accessible on multiple 
devices at the same time. The most popular bookmarking services 
are Atavi (https://atavi.com), Pinterest (www.pinterest.com), and 
Pocket (https://getpocket.com).
• 
Product/service review: These websites allow their users to review—
give feedback—about any product or service they have used. Other
