User: I have a tool which I have written in python and generally should be run as a daemon.  What are the best practices for packaging this tool for distribution, particularly how should settings files and the daemon executable/script be handled?
Relatedly are there any common tools for setting up the daemon for running on boot as appropriate for the given platform (i.e. init scripts on linux, services on windows, launchd on os x)?
Assistant: On Linux systems, the system's package manager (Portage for Gentoo, Aptitude for Ubuntu/Debian, yum for Fedora, etc.) usually takes care of installing the program including placing init scripts in the right places. If you want to distribute your program for Linux, you might want to look into bundling it up into the proper format for various distributions' package managers.
This advice is obviously irrelevant on systems which don't have package managers (Windows, and Mac I think).
