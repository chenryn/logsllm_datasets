Question: "A developer wrote a function to execute a file listing within a specified directory received from user input. The developer aims to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. Which of the following implementations of input validation would be the best practice to mitigate this risk?"
 "A": "Reject any input containing non-alphanumeric characters, including special symbols such as ';' or '/'."
 "B": "Perform strict input validation by only allowing characters that are strictly required for the operation, such as alphanumeric and underscore."
 "C": "Use a denylist approach and only filter out known dangerous characters like ';', '&', and '|'."
 "D": "Prepend a '--' to the list of arguments to ensure that any input starting with '-' is treated as a filename and not as an option."
Answer: B
