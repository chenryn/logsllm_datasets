**ATT&CK ID:** M1025  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Process Integrity

**Description:**
To enhance security on Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2, enable Local Security Authority (LSA) Protection by setting the following Registry key:

- **Registry Key Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\RunAsPPL`
- **Value:** `dword:00000001`

**Functionality:**
LSA Protection ensures that LSA plug-ins and drivers are only loaded if they meet the following criteria:
- They are digitally signed with a valid Microsoft signature.
- They adhere to the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process guidelines.

This measure helps to maintain the integrity of privileged processes and mitigates the risk of loading malicious or untrusted code.
