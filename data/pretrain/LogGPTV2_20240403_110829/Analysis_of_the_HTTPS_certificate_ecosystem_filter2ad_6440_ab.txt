### Root Store and Certificate Validation
We maintain a root store that enables us to validate any certificate signed by a previously encountered intermediate Certificate Authority (CA), regardless of the presented certificate chain.

### Post-Scan Validation
After each scan, we check certificates without a known issuer against our set of known authorities. If a new issuer is found, we revalidate any associated child certificates. This process resolves cases where an intermediate CA is discovered in a subsequent scan.

### Data Parsing and Storage
We parse collected TLS certificates using OpenSSL and store the parsed data and historical host state in a PostgreSQL database.

## 4.3 Reducing Scan Impact
We recognize that our scans can inadvertently trigger intrusion detection systems and may cause concern for some organizations. Many network administrators view port scans as a preliminary step in a targeted attack and often cannot distinguish between malicious and benign scanning activities.

To minimize the impact of our scans and avoid triggering intrusion detection systems, we use a random permutation over a twelve-hour period from a block of 64 sequential source IP addresses. During a host discovery scan, each destination address receives at most one probe packet. At this rate, a /24-sized network receives a probe packet every 195 seconds, a /16 block every 0.76 seconds, and a /8 network block every 3 milliseconds on average. In the certificate retrieval phase, we perform only one TLS handshake with each host that responded positively during the host discovery scan.

To help users identify our intentions, we serve a simple webpage on all the IP addresses used for scanning, explaining the purpose of our scans and providing instructions on how to request exclusion from future scans. We also registered reverse DNS records to identify scanning hosts as part of an academic research study. Throughout the study, we coordinated with local network administrators to promptly handle inquiries and complaints.

Over 14 months, we received email correspondence from 145 individuals and organizations. Most notifications were informative, primarily alerting us to potential infected machines or requesting exclusion from future scans. The majority of these requests were received at our institution’s WHOIS abuse address or the email address published on the scanner IPs. In response, we explained the purpose of our scans and excluded the sender’s network from future scans upon request. Ultimately, we excluded networks belonging to 91 organizations or individuals, totaling 3,753,899 addresses (0.11% of the public IPv4 address space). Two requests from Internet service providers accounted for 49% of the excluded addresses. During our scans, we received 12 hostile responses, including threats of legal action or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In two cases, we received retaliatory DoS traffic, which was automatically filtered by our upstream provider.

We discuss the ethical implications of performing active scanning and provide more details about the steps we take to reduce scan impact in our previous work [13].

## 4.4 Data Collection Results
We completed 110 successful scans of the IPv4 address space, performing 2.55 billion TLS handshakes between June 6, 2012, and August 4, 2013. Similar to Holz et al. [17], we observed that many hosts on port 443 do not complete a TLS handshake; in our case, only 67% of hosts with port 443 open successfully completed a TLS handshake.

During each scan, we retrieved an average of 8.1 million unique certificates, of which 3.2 million were browser-trusted. The remaining 4.9 million untrusted certificates included self-signed certificates (48%), certificates signed by an unknown issuer (33%), and certificates signed by a known but untrusted issuer (19%). Over the past eleven months, we retrieved 42.4 million distinct certificates from 108.8 million unique IP addresses. On average, 48% of hosts that performed complete TLS handshakes presented browser-trusted X.509 certificates.

In our largest and most recent scan on August 4, 2013, we retrieved 9.0 million certificates from 24.4 million IP addresses, of which 3.3 million were browser-trusted. Table 1 provides a comparison with previous work. Additionally, over 95% of trusted certificates and over 98% of hosts serving trusted certificates are located in only ten countries, as shown in Table 2.

### Top 10 Countries Serving Trusted Certificates
| Country | Authorities Certificates | Hosts |
|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| United States | 30.34% | 77.55% |
| United Kingdom | 3.27% | 10.88% |
| Belgium | 2.67% | 1.51% |
| Israel | 1.63% | 3.29% |
| Netherlands | 2.18% | 0.87% |
| Japan | 3.38% | 2.56% |
| Germany | 21.28% | 0.49% |
| France | 3.98% | 1.32% |
| Australia | 0.81% | 1.06% |
| Korea | 1.41% | 1.19% |

### Non-Temporal Analysis
For this study, we chose to perform non-temporal analysis on the results from a representative scan conducted on March 22, 2013 (highlighted column in Table 1). We focused on a single point-in-time rather than considering all certificates found over the past year due to varying lifespans. Organizations use certificates with differing validity periods, and in some cases, devices present different certificates in each scan. Considering all certificates from the past year would skew several of our statistics due to the short-lived nature of some certificates.

## 4.5 Is Frequent Scanning Necessary?
Frequent repeated scans allow us to discover additional certificates that would otherwise remain invisible. Analyzing the 36 scans we performed between January 1 and March 31, 2013, we found that 54% of browser-trusted certificates appeared in all 36 scans, and 70% appeared in more than 30 of the 36 scans. Surprisingly, 33% of self-signed certificates appeared in only one scan during this three-month period. Many of these self-signed certificates appear to be served by embedded devices that generate new certificates regularly. We found an average of 260,000 new certificates per scan during this period. The distribution is shown in Figure 1. Frequent scanning provides significant advantages in obtaining a global perspective on the certificates valid at any single point in time and understanding the changing dynamics of the ecosystem over extended periods.

## 4.6 Server Name Indication Deployment
Both Holz [17] and Akhawe [4] cite Server Name Indication (SNI) as a reason for scanning the Alexa Top 1 Million Domains and performing passive measurements instead of full IPv4 scans. SNI is a TLS extension that allows a client to specify the hostname it is attempting to connect to from the start of the TLS negotiation [9]. This enables a server to present multiple certificates on a single IP address and host multiple HTTPS sites off the same IP address without sharing a single certificate. Since our scans connect to hosts based on IP address and not by hostname, we might miss certificates that require a specific hostname.

To better understand the deployment of SNI and its impact on our results, we scanned the Alexa Top 1 Million Domains using the same methodology as for the IPv4 address space. Of the Alexa Top 1 Million Domains, 323,502 successfully performed TLS handshakes, and 129,695 domains presented browser-trusted certificates. Only 0.7% of the domains that completed a TLS handshake presented certificates we had not seen in the most recent IPv4 scan. While we cannot quantify the number of hosts missed due to SNI, it is clear that a small number of websites are adopting SNI. One reason for the limited adoption is the lack of SNI support in Internet Explorer on Windows XP, which still represents more than a third of all operating system installations [26].

## 5. CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES
The security of the HTTPS ecosystem ultimately depends on the set of CAs entrusted to sign browser-trusted certificates. Any organization with control of a signing certificate that chains to a browser-trusted root can sign a leaf certificate for any domain, making the entire ecosystem as fragile as the weakest CA. However, there is no central, public registry of browser-trusted intermediate authorities, so the organizations controlling these signing certificates may be unknown until their signed certificates are spotted in the wild. In this section, we describe the CAs we found during our scans and some of the practices they employ.

### Identifying Trusted Authorities
Between April 2012 and August 2013, we observed 3,788 browser-trusted signing certificates, of which 1,832 were valid on March 22, 2013. All but seven of these signing certificates can sign a valid browser-trusted certificate for any domain. This is 25% more than the EFF found in 2010 and more than 327% more than Ristic [31] found. Holz et al. found 2,300 intermediate certificates in their active scanning [17], but this count appears to include both browser-trusted and untrusted intermediates. In our March 22 scan, we found 121,580 untrusted intermediates and 417,970 over the past year. While the raw number of signing certificates and the HTTPS ecosystem have grown significantly over the past three years, the number of identified organizations has not increased substantially.

These 1,832 signing certificates belong to 683 organizations and are located in 57 countries. Although a large number of countries have jurisdiction over at least one trusted browser authority, 99% of the authorities are located in only 10 countries, as shown in Table 2. We classified the types of organizations that control a CA certificate, as shown in Table 3. We were surprised to find that religious institutions, museums, libraries, and more than 130 corporations and financial institutions currently control an unrestricted CA certificate. Only 20% of organizations that control signing certificates are commercial CAs. We were unable to identify 15 signing certificates due to a lack of identification information or ambiguous naming. Despite a 2% increase in the raw number of valid signing certificates over the past year, the number of organizations with control of a signing certificate has remained relatively stable.

### Sources of Intermediates
Organizations other than commercial CAs control 1,350 of the 1,832 (74%) browser-trusted signing certificates, raising the question of who provides intermediate certificates to these organizations. We found that 276 of the 293 academic institutions, along with all libraries, museums, healthcare providers, and religious institutions, were signed by the German National Research and Education Network (DFN), which offers intermediate certificates to all members of the German network. DFN provided CA certificates to 311 organizations in total, nearly half of the organizations we identified.
