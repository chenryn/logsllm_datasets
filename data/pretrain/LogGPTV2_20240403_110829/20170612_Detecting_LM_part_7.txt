Remote Desktop (RDP) is an example of applications often used via Htran. In this case, a communication on the destination port 3389/tcp with
the source host IP address of the "source host" where Htran was executed is recorded in the "destination host", which is the tunnel destination.
*For details on RDP logs, see the separate RDP document.
Remarks
When a version that supports a HTTP proxy is used, HTTPS communication is recorded in the proxy.
Additional Event Logs That Can Be Output
If SSL cannot be decoded due to HTTPS, only the CONNECT method is recorded.
