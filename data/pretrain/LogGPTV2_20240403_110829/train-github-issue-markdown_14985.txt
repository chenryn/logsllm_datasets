Hello everyone,

Initially, I was able to successfully run the demo located in `/ios_examples/camera`. Subsequently, I used `retrain.py` to retrain a model with my own dataset. This process generated an `output_graph.pb` file and an `output_labels.txt` file. After replacing the files in `/ios_examples/camera/data` with these new files, I attempted to run the demo again, but it failed. The error messages are as follows:

```
#### Error ####
Could not create TensorFlow Graph: Invalid argument: No OpKernel was registered to support Op 'DecodeJpeg' with these attrs. Registered devices: [CPU], Registered kernels:
     [[Node: DecodeJpeg = DecodeJpeg[acceptable_fraction=1, channels=3, dct_method="", fancy_upscaling=true, ratio=1, try_recover_truncated=false](DecodeJpeg/contents)]]

```

Can someone please help me understand how to resolve this issue?

Thank you.
