EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
ERP Planning: Separation of Duties  
October 17, 2018 
PURPOSE OF THE AUDIT 
The purpose of this audit was to evaluate the adequacy of separation of duties for various activities 
in the current SAP system and make recommendations to ensure that any identified deficiencies 
are corrected for the new ERP system. 
REPORT HIGHLIGHTS  
Finding:  
Implementing 
effective separation  
of duties and ensuring 
well‐restricted user 
access controls for the 
new ERP system will 
decrease 
vulnerabilities and 
risks 
The City uses varying automated and manual processes for separating key 
business activities and duties among staff for the high‐risk activities we 
reviewed, such as payroll processing, purchase orders and check 
processing, revenue collections, and asset management transactions. 
Although we did not find any major concerns, we identified opportunities 
for improvement. We assessed an employee’s ability to access and 
perform transactions within high‐risk areas. We also offered an 
understanding of where the high‐risk areas are within various workflows. 
Key Recommendation: 
When implementing the new ERP system, the Administrative Services, 
Information Technology, and Utilities Departments should separate duties 
for high‐risk conflicting tasks by restricting transaction codes or 
developing mitigating controls where conflicts cannot be avoided.

INTRODUCTION 
Objective 
Background 
Separation of Duties 
(SoD) 
Standards and 
Guidance 
The purpose of this audit was to evaluate the adequacy of separation of 
duties for various activities in the current SAP system and make 
recommendations to ensure that any identified deficiencies are corrected 
for the new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. 
An ERP system is a type of business management software that integrates 
key business activities of the City, such as purchasing, inventory, utilities, 
accounting, payroll, and information technology. SAP is the current ERP 
system and has been in place since 2003. The city issued a Request for 
Proposal (RFP) and plans to complete migrating the City’s business data 
and processes into a new ERP system by June 2022.  
Separation of duties (SoD), also known as segregation of duties, is an 
internal control mechanism to reduce the risk of erroneous or fraudulent 
transactions, improper program changes, and the damage or destruction 
of computer resources. This is accomplished by separating parts of a 
process or activity across a department or organization. To reduce the risk 
of unauthorized transactions (intentional or unintentional), work 
responsibilities and the corresponding computer access should be 
segregated so that one individual does not control multiple critical stages 
of a process. For example, a person should not be allowed to enter an 
invoice for payment, approve an invoice for payment, process the invoice 
for payment, and disburse a check for payment. Doing so would result in 
an opportunity for that individual to create and process an unauthorized 
payment transaction.  
We used the ISACA report, “Best Practices to resolve Segregation of 
Duties conflicts in any ERP environment," to document high‐risk 
conflicting tasks in ERP systems and how they can be mitigated with 
automated separation of duties within the system, and developed criteria, 
which is explained below in the methodology section.1 
For general guidance on separation of duties, we referred to the 
“Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,” sections 
10.12 ‐ 10.14: Segregation of Duties, published in September 2014 by the 
United States Government Accountability Office. These sections give 
1 ISACA previously stood for Information Systems Audit and Control Association, but now goes by its acronym only. It is an 
independent, nonprofit, global association that engages in the development, adoption, and use of globally accepted, 
industry‐leading knowledge and practices for information systems.

Risk of not

SoD Responsibility 
ERP Planning: Separation of Duties 
general guidance on the role of segregation of duties for internal control 
and the option for alternative control activities if separation of duties is 
not practical due to staffing limitations or other factors.   
We referenced and used as guidance the “Federal Information System 
Controls Audit Manual” (FISCAM), sections 3.2: Access Controls and 3.4: 
Segregation of Duties, published in February 2009 by the United States 
Government Accountability Office, to generally assess the City’s control 
systems. It states that “effective segregation of duties starts with effective 
entitywide policies and procedures that are implemented at the system 
and application levels.” 
According to a 2016 report on occupational fraud and abuse by the 
Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), asset misappropriation 
was the most common form of occupational fraud.2 Among the various 
forms of asset misappropriation, billing schemes and check tampering 
schemes were reported as posing the greatest risk. 
In an ERP system, risks and vulnerabilities may arise from the lack of 
proper segregation of duties. Unintended risks often stem from granting 
employees excessive system authorizations by providing access to 
functions that are not within their official duties. Challenges can occur 
with the lack of resources, both financial and staffing. 
Therefore, planning for the division of responsibilities and reflecting it in 
the access privileges granted through an automated process to users of 
Information Technology (IT) systems, as well as implementing manual 
processes to mitigate any residual risk, such as collusion, becomes 
necessary for the proper, efficient, and secure execution of the business 
processes. 
The responsibility of SoD in the City resides within each business process 
area and within the IT systems supporting their execution. An effective 
SoD strategy requires that each business area, with a thorough 
understanding of its business process and workflow, collaborate with IT to 
gain an understanding of the system supporting SoD so the business area 
can structure and help IT design ERP security around separation of duties 
issues, particularly in the highest‐risk areas. 
2 Under the Occupational Fraud and Abuse Classification System (Fraud Tree), asset misappropriation includes the theft of 
cash receipts and fraudulent disbursements, such as billing schemes, expense reimbursement schemes, check tampering, 
and register disbursements. Statistics included in the ACFE’s report are based only on the results of the single largest fraud 
case that certified fraud examiners self‐reported in an online survey sponsored by the ACFE.

Scope 
Methodology 
We reviewed best practices for separation of duties for ERP systems and 
used criteria to assess the highest areas of risk to the City. Because this 
audit is intended to provide high‐level guidance, we did not review and 
assess SoD for all workflow processes. We only identified the highest‐risk 
areas and made recommendations for use as the City implements the 
future ERP system.  
To accomplish our objective, we: 
  Researched and identified SoD best practices and guidance. 
  Created separation of duties criteria matrices from the list of high‐risk 
conflicting tasks in ISACA’s document, “Best Practices to resolve 
Segregation of Duties conflicts in any ERP environment," for six areas:  
1.  Accounts Payable 
2.  Payroll/Human Resource 
3.  Revenue Collections 
4.  Treasury 
5.  Utilities 
6.  Information Technology 
  Identified active employees, their user profiles, and their executable 
transactions in SAP. 
  Reviewed and analyzed conflicting tasks within the high‐risk list. 
  Discussed with staff any mitigating processes that address active users 
who have conflicting tasks. 
  Determined the effectiveness of the mitigating processes, both
