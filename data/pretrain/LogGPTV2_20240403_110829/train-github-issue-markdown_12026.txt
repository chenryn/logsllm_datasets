### Issue Description
The PyEM example titled "Creating, sampling, and plotting a mixture" available at [http://www.ar.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/david/softwares/pyem/](http://www.ar.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/david/softwares/pyem/) produces an unexpected plot. The generated plot appears to consist only of integer data points, which is different from the example plot shown on the website.

Additionally, after entering the provided example code, no plot is displayed. I had to manually add `P.show()` to display the plot. I have attached a screenshot for reference. 

I am relatively new to this, so it's possible that I may be missing something.
