The PyEM example "Creating, sampling and plotting a mixture" on  
http://www.ar.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/david/softwares/pyem/ results in a
strange plot that seems to consist of only integer data points. This differs
from the example plot on the website.  
Furthermore, after entering the example code, no plot is shown at all, so I
added P.show() myself. I try to send a screen shot with this. Things may
relate to the fact that I'm a newbie.
