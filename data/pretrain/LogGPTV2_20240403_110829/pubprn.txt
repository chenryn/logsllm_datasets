**Applies to:**

- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `pubprn` command is a Visual Basic script used to publish a printer to Active Directory Domain Services. This script is located in the `%WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\` directory. To run this command from the command prompt, you need to use `cscript` followed by the full path to the `pubprn` file, or change directories to the appropriate folder.

**Example Usage:**
```cmd
cscript %WINdir%\System32\printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\pubprn
```

**Syntax:**
```cmd
cscript pubprn {<ComputerName> | <UNCPath>} LDAP://CN=<ContainerName>,DC=<DomainComponent>
```

**Parameters:**

- **<ComputerName>**: Specifies the name of the Windows server that hosts the printer you want to publish. If no computer is specified, the local computer is used.
- **<UNCPath>**: The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to the shared printer you want to publish.
- **LDAP://CN=<ContainerName>,DC=<DomainComponent>**: Specifies the path to the container in Active Directory Domain Services where you want to publish the printer.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- Ensure that the user running the command has the necessary permissions to publish printers in the specified Active Directory container.
- The `<ComputerName>` and `<UNCPath>` parameters are mutually exclusive; you should use one or the other, but not both.

**Examples:**

1. **Publish all printers on a specific server:**
   ```cmd
   cscript pubprn Server1 LDAP://CN=MyContainer,DC=MyDomain,DC=company,DC=com
   ```

2. **Publish a specific printer on a server:**
   ```cmd
   cscript pubprn \\Server1\Laserprinter1 LDAP://CN=MyContainer,DC=MyDomain,DC=company,DC=com
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively publish printers to the desired container in Active Directory Domain Services.
