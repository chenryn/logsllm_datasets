 United States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54 (D. Mass. 
July 22, 2005)
 Definition of Special Skills
 Special skill - a skill not possessed by members of the 
general public and usually requiring substantial 
education, training or licensing.
 Examples - pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, 
chemists, and demolition experts
 Not necessarily have formal education or training
 Acquired through experience or self-tutelage
 Critical question is - whether the skill set elevates to a 
level of knowledge and proficiency that eclipses that 
possessed by the general public.

 Feds won't deem proxies 'sophisticated'
 US government has dropped --for now--a plan to classify the use of 
"proxy“ servers as evidence of sophistication in committing a crime. 
 US Sentencing Commission was considering a change to federal 
sentencing guidelines that would have increased sentences by about 25 
percent for people convicted of crimes in which proxies are used to 
hide the perpetrators' tracks. 
 Digital-rights advocates complained language too broad 
 Commission struck the controversial language from the amendments 
 Justice Department supported the proposed amendment as a way to 
hand down stiffer sentences for people who set up elaborate proxy 
networks--sometimes in multiple countries --to commit crimes and 
hide their identities.
 Digital-rights advocates said the amendment would have sent a 
chilling message about using a common technology that is often 
encouraged as a safer way of using the Internet.
Fortunately US Sentencing Commission will

In re: Grand Jury Subpoena to Sebastien Boucher, 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13006 (DC Ver. Feb. 19, 
2009)
 Gov’t appeal US Magistrate Judge’s Opinion and Order 
granting Defendant’s motion to quash grand jury 
subpoena that it violates his Fifth Amendment right.
 Gov’t doesn’t want password for encrypted HD wants only 
to have defendant provide an unencrypted version of the 
HD to grand jury.
 Court –Boucher must provide an unencrypted version of 
HD to grand jury.
 Acts of producing incriminating 2 situations – 1 existence 
and location unknown to Gov’t; 2 production implicitly 
authenticates.
 Gov’t knows incriminating files on encrypted drive Z: and 
will not use this as “authentication” will link files to 
Defendant in other way

United States v.  Megahed, 2009 WL 722481 (M.D. 
Fla. March 18, 2009)
 Suspect not home FBI ask father for consent to search, FBI 
takes computer away August 6, 2007
 2 months later father w/d consent, unclear when image made
 Computer not searched until a year later (apparently) key 
evidence discovered October 2008
 Motion to suppress evidence discovered – internet history file.
 After agents searched, seized computer, captured mirror image 
copy, and returned HD to defendant, evidence was discovered in 
course of examine of mirror image copy.
 In October 2008 neither defendant or his father retained a 
reasonable expectation of privacy in the mirror image copy.
 Valid consent to search carries the right to examine and 
photocopy.
 See US v Ponder, 444 F. 2d 816, 818 (5th Cir. 1971): Mason v 
Pulliam, 557 F. 2d 426, 429 (5th Cir. 1977)(IRS document case).
United States v. Cotterman, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
14300 (DC Ariz. Feb. 23, 2009)
 Search only justified as a border search because no p/c at all to allow the 
search of the computer.
 Decision to search based upon a TECS hit out of California based upon the 
fact Defendant had a 15 year old child molestation conviction.
 Search could have been done, (while not necessarily to the convenience of 
the agents) at border, technician could have traveled from Tucson to do the 
analysis.
 Defendant and wife waited more than 8 hours at the border finally told 
computer going to be taken to Tucson even though he offered  to help 
access the computer at the border. This offer was declined by the agents.
 Search took at least 48 hours to yield results.
 Cannot be said that Tucson became functional equivalent of border.
 Because Tucson not functional equivalent of border (170 miles away) 
Court agrees with the MJ evidence should be suppressed.

 Installed virus on office and personal computer to steal

 Defendant motion to dismiss –
 sending virus to detect and steal passwords located on a

electronic communication for purposes of federal Wiretap act.
 SCA does not apply
 CFAA inapplicable – no harm plead
 Court held – Wiretap Act claim dismissed 
 SCA claim unclear at this time whether Trojan program 
accessed information stored on device

United States v. Steiger, 318 F.3d 1039, 1047 (11th Cir. 2003). See Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. 
United States Secret Service, 36 F.3d 457 (5th Cir. 1994); Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 302 
F.3d 868 (9th Cir. 2001); In re Pharmatrak, Inc., 329 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2003); and Fraser v. 
Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 352 F.3d 107 (3rd Cir. 2003).
 SCA Claim
This court agrees with the reasoning  in Theofel. The fact that Plaintiff may have already read the 
emails and messages copied by Defendant does not take them out of the purview of the Stored 
Communications Act. The plain language of the statute seems to include emails received by the 
intended recipient where they remain stored by an electronic communication service.
However, as a point of clarification, Stored Communications Act protection does not extend to emails 
and messages stored only on Plaintiff's personal computer. In re Doubleclick Inc., 154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 
511 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)("the cookies' residence on plaintiffs' computers does not fall into § 2510(17)(B)
because plaintiffs are not 'electronic communication service' providers."). Defendant does not set 
forth any other basis for dismissing the claim. Accordingly, Defendant Bailey is not entitled to 
summary judgment on Plaintiff's  [*18] claim for violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2701. 
Bailey v. Bailey, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8565 (E.D. 
Mich. Feb. 6, 2008)
 For the enterprise network manager, the notion of 
responsible disclosure has centered on the idea that major 
security flaws in products they use wouldn’t be shared 
publicly in any way until a software vendor corrected them. 
That's the underlying premise of what’s called the 
Organization for Internet Safety (OIS) guidelines first 
released five years ago and updated in 2004. An effort 
spearheaded by Microsoft, the OIS guidelines now face 
criticism from some of the very people who wrote them, 
who argue enterprises should know about serious flaws 
early for purposes of security workarounds.

Gutman v Klein, 2008 U.S. dist LEXIS 92398 (E.D. 
N.Y. Oct. 15 2008) (Civil Litigation Case)
 Spoliation of Evidence, deletion Defendant's laptop
 MJ ordered defendant to make available HDs, suspected 
tampering, MJ court appointed forensic expert examination
 “indicative of behavior of a user who was attempting to 
permanently delete selective files from the machine and 
then cover up the chronology of system changes occurring 
in the hours and days just prior to a forensic preservation." 
 Litigation started 5 years earlier, duty to preserve, 
Defendant’s explanation contradictory and incredible.
 MJ what to do in response to spoliation – DJ
 When a trial court is confronted with a defamation action in which 
anonymous speakers or pseudonyms are involved, it should
 1 require plaintiff to undertake efforts to notify anonymous posters they 
are subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure, 
including posting a message of notification of the identity discovery 
request on the message board; 
 2 withhold action to afford the anonymous posters reasonable 
opportunity to file and serve opposition to the application; 
 3 require plaintiff to identify and set forth exact statements purportedly 
made by each anonymous poster, alleged to constitute actionable 
speech; 
 4 determine whether complaint has set forth a prima facie defamation 
per se or per quod action against the anonymous posters; and 
 5 if all else is satisfied, balance anonymous poster's First Amendment 
right against strength of the prima facie case of defamation presented by 
plaintiff and necessity for disclosure of anonymous defendant's identity, 
prior to ordering disclosure.
