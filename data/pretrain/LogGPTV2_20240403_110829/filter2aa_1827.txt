# DEFCON 17 Presentation
**Date:** July 31, 2009  
**Presenter:** R.W. Clark

## Definition of Special Skills
### Legal Context
- **Case Reference:** *United States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54 (D. Mass. July 22, 2005)*
- **Definition:** A special skill is a skill not commonly possessed by the general public and usually requires substantial education, training, or licensing.
- **Examples:** Pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts.
- **Note:** These skills can be acquired through experience or self-tutelage, not necessarily formal education.
- **Critical Question:** Does the skill set elevate to a level of knowledge and proficiency that surpasses that of the general public?

### Court Recognition of Special Skills
- The U.S. government has, for now, dropped plans to classify the use of "proxy" servers as evidence of sophistication in committing a crime.
- **Background:**
  - The U.S. Sentencing Commission was considering a change to federal sentencing guidelines that would increase sentences by about 25% for crimes involving proxies.
  - Digital-rights advocates argued that the language was too broad.
  - The Commission removed the controversial language from the amendments.
  - The Justice Department supported the amendment to impose harsher sentences on those who set up elaborate proxy networks to commit crimes and hide their identities.
  - Advocates argued that this would send a chilling message about using a common technology often encouraged for safer internet use.

  - The court ruled that Boucher must provide an unencrypted version of the hard drive to the grand jury.
