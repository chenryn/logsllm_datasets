User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Make a Docker application write to stdout I'm deploying a 3rd-party application in compliance with the 12 factor advisory, and one of the points tell that application logs should be printed to stdout/stderr: then clustering software can collect it.

However, the application can only write to files or syslog. How do I print these logs instead?

Assistant: An amazing recipe is given in the nginx Dockerfile:

# forward request and error logs to docker log collector
RUN ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \
    &amp;&amp; ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log


Simply, the app can continue writing to it as a file, but as a result the lines will go to stdout &amp; stderr!
