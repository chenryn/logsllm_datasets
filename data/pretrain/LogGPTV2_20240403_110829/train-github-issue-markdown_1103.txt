Our system is a mish-mash of various mailing systems, including sendmail,
JavaMail, KanaMail, and some others. I'd like to be able to collect all of
these different message types in a list and do a batch send. The problem is
that the base MailSender.send() method takes a SimpleMailMessage class instead
of the base MailMessage interface. The problem is that I'm also submitting
MimeMailMessages, which don't extend SimpleMailMessage. So I can't just pass
in a generic MailMessage object (which could be a SimpleMailMessage or a
MimeMailMessage or one of the other MailMessage-derived types I've created)
into send().
This is obviously done because MailMessage doesn't have any getter methods and
these are necessary. I'd suggest adding the getters to the base MailMessage
interface. That lets generic sender and message code work on these base
methods, while letting us develop the necessary code to support special
functionality elsewhere. So the two steps I'm suggesting are:
  1. Add getters to MailMessage interface.
  2. Change the send() methods in MailSender to take MailMessage instead of SimpleMailMessage.
