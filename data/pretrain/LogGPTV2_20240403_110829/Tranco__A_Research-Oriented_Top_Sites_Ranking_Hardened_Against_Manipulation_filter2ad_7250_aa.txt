## Abstract
To evaluate the prevalence of security and privacy practices on a representative sample of the web, researchers often rely on website popularity rankings such as the Alexa list. Despite their widespread use, the validity and representativeness of these rankings are rarely questioned. Our findings reveal significant issues with four major rankings (Alexa, Cisco Umbrella, Majestic, and Quantcast) in terms of similarity, stability, representativeness, responsiveness, and benignness. These properties can skew research conclusions. Additionally, we demonstrate that these rankings are easily manipulated, even by a single HTTP request in the case of Alexa. This vulnerability allows adversaries to alter the composition of these lists, potentially inserting malicious domains into whitelists or influencing research outcomes. To address these limitations, we propose improvements to reduce fluctuations and enhance defenses against manipulation. We introduce TRANCO, an improved ranking available through an online service at https://tranco-list.eu, to provide the research community with a reliable and reproducible alternative.

## 1. Introduction
Researchers and security analysts frequently study popular websites to measure the prevalence of security issues or as an evaluation set of commonly used domain names. The most widely used list for this purpose is Alexa, which was temporarily taken offline in November 2016, causing concern among researchers [11]. However, several other companies also provide alternative rankings based on Internet usage data collected through various channels, such as user panels, tracking code, and ISP traffic. We found that 133 top-tier studies over the past four years have based their experiments and conclusions on these rankings. The validity of these rankings, and consequently the research that relies on them, should be questioned due to the lack of transparency in the methods used and potential commercial biases.

In this paper, we show that the four main popularity rankings (Alexa, Cisco Umbrella, Majestic, and Quantcast) exhibit significant problems for research use. These rankings disagree on the popularity of domains, and some, like Alexa and Cisco Umbrella, experience substantial daily turnover. Furthermore, all lists include non-representative and even malicious sites, which is particularly dangerous given their use as whitelists. These flaws can severely skew measurements of vulnerabilities or secure practices.

We are the first to empirically prove that these rankings are vulnerable to manipulation techniques, which can be implemented at a surprisingly low cost. For example, a single HTTP request can alter the Alexa ranking. Adversaries can use these techniques to affect the rank of thousands of domains, making it possible to reach the top 10,000. The incentives for adversaries to manipulate these lists, both for individual domains and on a larger scale, make this manipulation particularly valuable.

To address these issues, we propose improvements to current rankings in terms of stability, representativeness, and resistance to manipulation. We introduce TRANCO, a new ranking available through an online service at https://tranco-list.eu, to enhance the reproducibility of studies. Researchers can continue to study popular domains while ensuring valid and verifiable research.

### Contributions:
- **Impact on Security Research**: We describe how the main rankings can negatively affect security research, such as the daily turnover of half of the Alexa list and the inclusion of 2,162 malicious domains in the Majestic list.
- **Classification of Studies**: We classify how 133 recent security studies rely on these rankings, particularly Alexa, and show how adversaries could exploit the rankings to bias these studies.
- **Manipulation Techniques**: We demonstrate that each list has at least one technique to manipulate it on a large scale, such as using a single HTTP request to enter the Alexa top million.
- **Tranco**: Motivated by the limitations of existing lists, we propose TRANCO, an alternative list that varies only by 0.6% daily and requires at least four times the manipulation effort to achieve the same rank as in existing lists.

## 2. Methodology of Top Websites Rankings
Multiple commercial providers publish rankings of popular domains using various methods. For Alexa, Cisco Umbrella, Majestic, and Quantcast, we discuss their data collection methods, ranking metrics, and potential biases. We base our discussion on the documentation available from these providers, noting that many components are proprietary.

### 2.1 Alexa
Alexa, a subsidiary of Amazon, publishes a daily updated list of one million websites since December 2008. The ranks are based on traffic data from a "global data panel," with domains ranked on a proprietary measure of unique visitors and page views. Alexa claims to apply "data normalization" to account for biases in their user panel. The panel is claimed to consist of millions of users who have installed browser extensions, but our analysis suggests a much smaller user base. Additionally, sites can install an 'Alexa Certify' tracking script for more accurate traffic counts. The downloadable list is based on data for one day, a change confirmed by Alexa but otherwise unannounced.

### 2.2 Cisco Umbrella
Cisco Umbrella publishes a daily updated list of one million entries since December 2016. The ranks are based on DNS traffic to its two DNS resolvers, claimed to handle over 100 billion daily requests from 65 million users. Domains are ranked on the number of unique IPs issuing DNS queries. Non-browser-based traffic is also accounted for, leading to the inclusion of invalid domains.

### 2.3 Majestic
Majestic publishes the 'Majestic Million' list, consisting of one million websites since October 2012. The ranks are based on backlinks obtained by crawling around 450 billion URLs over 120 days. Sites are ranked on the number of class C (IPv4 /24) subnets that refer to the site. This method implies a bias towards browser-based traffic without counting actual page visits.

### 2.4 Quantcast
Quantcast publishes a list of the most visited websites in the United States since mid-2007. The size of the list varies, usually around 520,000 mostly pay-level domains. The ranks are based on the number of people visiting a site within the previous month, including directly measured traffic and estimated traffic from ISPs and toolbar providers. The list focuses on US traffic, and the removal of non-quantified sites after November 14, 2018, reduced the list size to around 40,000.

## 3. Quantitative Comparison
Ideally, domain rankings would perfectly reflect the popularity of websites, free from biases. However, the providers do not have access to complete internet usage data and use undisclosed methods to determine their rankings. This can lead to differences between the lists and potential hidden factors influencing the rankings. We compare the four main lists over time to assess these differences.

### 3.1 Similarity
Figure 1 shows the average number of sites that the rankings agree upon per day. The four lists combined contain around 2.82 million sites but agree on only around 70,000 sites. Using the Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO), we see that the lists of Alexa, Majestic, and Quantcast are the most similar, but even with heavy weighting, the RBO remains low between 24% and 33%. Umbrella's full list is the most dissimilar, with an RBO of between 4.5% and 15.5%, which is expected due to the inclusion of subdomains. Quantcast's removal of non-quantified sites after November 14, 2018, caused a significant drop in RBO to less than 5.5%.

### 3.2 Stability
Figure 2 shows the intersections between each provider’s lists for two consecutive days. Majestic’s and Quantcast’s lists are the most stable, changing at most by 0.6% daily. Alexa and Umbrella, however, experience substantial daily turnover, with Alexa's list changing by up to 50% daily.
