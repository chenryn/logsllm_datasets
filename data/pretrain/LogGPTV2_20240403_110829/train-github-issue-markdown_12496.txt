**Migrated issue, originally created by jvanasco (@jvanasco)**
There doesn't seem to be a (public) way to find out if a path has been
registered to a query for eager loading. (A non-public way seems to be
`query.__dict__['with_options']`)
I propose an enhancement to the Query API, which allows a query to be queried
for the status of eager loads.
In the simplest concept, it would just return a dict where the keys are a
stringified path, and the values are the type of load (joinedload vs
subqueryload vs contains_eager). If there is no eager loading for a given
relationship, then the key is absent.
    print q.registered_eagers()
    > {'foo': 'joinedload', 'foo.bar':' subqueryload', 'foo.biz': 'contains_eager'}
The use-case is when dealing with generative queries that are loading
relationships several layers deep; it becomes increasingly hard to ensure you
have a load-strategy for each intermediary relationship..
