User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题FreeNAS plugins won't load I recently set up my first server using FreeNAS, and have it up and running on my internal LAN. When I installed, I saw a list of plugins available, but I didn't install any at the time. Today, I went back to my FreeNAS setup, clicked the Plugins button, and saw "unexpected token &lt;" in the status window. I clicked Refresh, and it says "No entry has been found." I know that there are plugins available, but why are they suddenly not available?

Please let me know what further information I can provide. As I am very new to FreeNAS, and servers in general, I'm not sure where to find logs or anything like that. If someone tells me, I'll be glad to retrieve and post.

Build FreeNAS-9.3-STABLE-201502142001  
Platform Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3225 CPU @ 3.30GHz  
Memory 7869MB


Update 1:
I just ran tail -f /var/log/debug.log and saw this line when I refreshed my plugins list:

cmd_pipe.__init__: err = ERROR: No available repos!


At least this gives me a clue. Gonna keep searching.

Assistant: mine, FreeNAS 9.3.1 Stable.
