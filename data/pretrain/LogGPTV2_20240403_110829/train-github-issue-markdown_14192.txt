# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.5.2762.0
# Steps to reproduce
    # open Terminal with powershell
    # open git repo with more than 100 commits
    git log -100 # to fill in the entire screen with text
    Clear-Host
    # scroll up
# Expected behavior
Cannot scroll up, `Clear-Host` cleared the terminal, all previous output is
gone.
# Actual behavior
Scrolling up shows previous output. This repros with both Powershel 6.2.3 and
5.2.1.  
This does not happen with the powershell terminal, which correctly removes all
previous output.
