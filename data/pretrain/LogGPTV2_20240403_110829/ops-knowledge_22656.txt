User: How can I implement Comet / Server push in Google App Engine in Python?
Assistant: At this time, I would rule out doing Comet in App Engine (any language). Comet is based on long-lived HTTP connections, and App Engine will time out any single connection in about 30 seconds or so at most; it's hard to conceive of a worse match!
