User: How to configure NGINX server as reverse proxy?
Assistant: Before configuring the NGINX server as a reverse proxy, you need to confirm the following two points: 1. Confirm the service port to be proxied 2. Confirm the IP address or domain name of the proxy server Next, follow the steps below to configure the NGINX server as a reverse proxy: 1. . Install NGINX Server You can use your own system package manager to install NGINX, such as using apt-get or yum. After the installation is complete, start the NGINX service. 2. Configure NGINX reverse proxy Open the NGINX configuration file (usually /etc/nginx/nginx.conf), find the http or server segment, and add the following content to configure the reverse proxy: ``` server { listen 80; server_name localhost; location / { proxy_pass http://IP address or domain name of proxy server: proxy port number; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } ` `` Among them, the proxy_pass option specifies the server to be proxied, and the other three proxy_set_header options will pass the client's real IP address to the target server through the HTTP header. 3. After restarting the NGINX server to save the configuration file, restart the NGINX service to take effect. Note: In the above example, port 80 is proxied. If you want to proxy other ports, you only need to modify the listen option to the corresponding port.
