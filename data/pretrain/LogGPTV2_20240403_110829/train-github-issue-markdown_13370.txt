In mui 0.x, I could limit the number of secondary text lines in a
``. With ``, I can't do that anymore.
As a consequence, the following design, which was supported by mui 0.9, isn't
possible with 1.0.

Besides, limiting lines in CSS is notably difficult.
Is adding back the max lines support in the plan, or is it definitely out of
the API, and I have to find another solution?
