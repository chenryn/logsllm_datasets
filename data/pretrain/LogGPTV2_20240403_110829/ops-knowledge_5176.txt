User: How do I create an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI, and how do I upload files to that instance?
Assistant: The following are the steps to create an EC2 instance and upload files to the instance using the AWS CLI: 1. Install the AWS CLI and configure the AWS access key and secret key. 2. To create an EC2 instance, use the following command: ``` aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxxxx --instance-type t2.micro --key-name my-key-pair --security-group- ids sg-xxxxxxxx --subnet-id subnet-xxxxxxxx ``` Among them, the `--image-id` parameter specifies the AMI ID used by the instance, the `--instance-type` parameter specifies the instance type, and `--key- The name` parameter specifies the name of the SSH key pair, the `--security-group-ids` parameter specifies the ID of the security group, and the `--subnet-id` parameter specifies the ID of the subnet. 3. Find the public IP address of the newly created EC2 instance, and use the following command to log in to the instance: ``` ssh -i my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@Public-IP-Address ``` Among them, `- The i` parameter specifies the path of the private key file, `ec2-user` is the default username, and `Public-IP-Address` is the public IP address of the EC2 instance. If you cannot connect, check that the security group and network access control list (NACL) allow SSH traffic. 4. Copy the file to be uploaded to the EC2 instance, and use the following command: ``` scp -i my-key-pair.pem /path/to/local/file ec2-user@Public-IP-Address:/path /to/remote/location ``` Among them, `/path/to/local/file` is the path of the local file, `Public-IP-Address` is the public network IP address of the EC2 instance, `/path/to/remote /location` is the path of the file to be uploaded in the EC2 instance.
