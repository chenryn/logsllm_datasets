User: Question is simple, i have a object file and i want to read the symbols of the object file via code.  I am aware that the linux command "nm" would be able to do this, but i want to be able to do it inside code.
Also note id like to do this either via C or Python.
Regards
Paul
Assistant: On linux object files are written in ELF file format.So i think you have to start with understanding the ELF file format and how OS write object file using this format.That can give you a idea how you can read object file and symbol table by your own program.To get some initial idea you can look into the source code of readelf tool.
