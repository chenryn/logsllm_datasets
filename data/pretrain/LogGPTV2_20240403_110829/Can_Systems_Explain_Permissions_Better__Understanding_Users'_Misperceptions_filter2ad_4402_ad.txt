are not clear enough to help users understand and differentiate
the actual capabilities of permission groups.
Another characteristic of wrong choices is that they are
related to some critical resources that are hard to infer simply
from the system descriptions. The system permission dialogs
provide the most direct notices to users when users make per-
mission decisions, but they only provide partial information
on what is given away after granting permission. Take Phone
permission group as an example, it protects phone-related
features such as making phone calls and accessing unique IDs
of the phone (e.g., IMEI number), but the system message is
only “make and manage phone calls”. In the survey results,
around three quarters (76.5%) of our respondents do not know
that the app can access IMEI after granting the permission,
which can be used to track the app users (Table 6).
In the Location question for iOS users, the permission
dialog contains a button, “Allow only while in use”, which
was introduced in iOS 11 in 2017. With this information, the
majority (83%) of iOS respondents correctly understood that
their location may be accessed when the app is running in the
background if they selected “Always allow”. This is different
from the previous ﬁnding that only as few as 17% of the users
knew that the background applications may have the same
capability as the foreground applications in 2013 when the
dialog does not contain such information [58]. This suggests
that through proper notices from systems, users can better
comprehend the capability of the permissions.

sion questions on Android and iOS. Permissions groups above the
dotted line are shared by Android and iOS even though minor differ-
ences as shown in Table 1. The others are unique to the platforms.
Rows are sorted based on the percentage of Correct answers. Correct
means that all of the correct choice(s) for the question are selected;
Partially correct means that not all correct choices are selected and
no wrong choices are selected; At least one incorrect means that one
or more wrong choices are selected.
Finding 4: Users are more likely to misunderstand
“coarser-grained” permission groups that control more per-
missions, sensitive resources, or their associated actions.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of different answer cate-
gories (All correct, Partially correct and At least one incor-
rect) for each permission group. Different permission groups
have different percentage of correct answers. The percentage
of All correct answers for Contact, Phone, and Call Log
permission groups on Android are lower than 10%. On the
contrary, most (80.5%) answers for Location are correct.
To understand why users have poor understandings of cer-
tain permission groups, we investigated the relationship be-
tween the granularity of permission groups and common mis-
understandings on certain permissions. The granularity of
the permission group in the runtime model refers to the num-
ber of similar capabilities grouped by the system. Note that
only Android deﬁned speciﬁc permissions under permission
groups, so we only study Android. We divided the permis-
sion groups according to the number of permissions in them.
Table 8 shows each permission group and the percentage of
completely correct answers. We ﬁnd that the average correct
percentage has a negative correlation with the number of per-
missions within the group on Android (Pearson coefﬁcient
r=-0.885, p=0.114; two-tailed). One outlier is the Call Log
permission group with 2 permissions but has a low correct
percentage. This group has many related functions related to
phone calls which may cause confusion without clear expla-
nations as described in Finding 3.

Finding 4.1: Users who accurately comprehend a permis-
sion group, tend to be more conservative in granting it.
To study the relationship between users’ comprehension
and their permission decisions, our survey 2 only asked re-
spondents to answer the corresponding permission compre-
hension questions after they made decisions in the simulated
scenarios (§3.3.1). We compared the initial permission grant
rates (i.e., the percentage of respondents who allowed the
permission request before seeing our provided information)
between respondents who correctly and incorrectly answered
the comprehension questions. We compared the results of the
three scenarios respectively and conducted Mann-Whitney U
Test to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the differences.
As shown in Table 9, users are more likely to deny a per-
mission if they can accurately understand it. The initial grant
rates of respondents who correctly answer the comprehension
questions are higher in all our evaluated scenarios except for
Android users in the scenario of Felp. The differences are
evaluated as signiﬁcant with Mann-Whitney U Test for half
of the compared groups. This suggests that when users know
exactly what data will be collected, they are more conserva-
tive towards granting a permission group. This may protect
them from unwanted data exposure or leakages since the data
cannot be accessed by the apps in the ﬁrst place.
As for the Felp (Contact) scenario, the Android users who
correctly comprehend the scope of the Contact permission
group accounts for only 6% of all Android respondents. This
can cause variability in the results and thus may induce the
exceptional results where the grant rate is higher for users
who correctly answer the comprehension questions.
5.2 Permission Management
Finding 5: Users may notice unexpected permissions after
reviewing their permission settings yet few of them (two out
of 20) regularly review their permission settings.
In the runtime permission model, users can review and
change their permission settings in system settings after
the ﬁrst-time permission decisions. In the interview study,
16 (80%) participants successfully found the permission man-
agement interfaces without any guidance from us. We further
asked how often they use the permission management and how
frequent they review their permission settings. Only two par-
ticipants mentioned they regularly reviewed their permission
settings like every month and would revoke the unnecessary
permissions found in the process. Eight participants indicated
that they would never review the permission settings. Others
just roughly mentioned that they may check the permission
settings but not regularly. However, after reviewing their per-
mission settings in our study, ﬁve participants quickly noticed
permissions unexpectedly granted to some apps. For example,
one participant said, “Why do Whatsapp have access to my
location? I don’t want anyone to access my location”.
This ﬁnding suggests that few users actively used permis-
sion management to revoke unwanted sensitive data access.
Previous works explored using personalized privacy nudges
to remind users to review settings [26, 48]. They found that
many users restricted their permissions after receiving nudges.
Recently, Android 10 uses a similar approach to actively re-
mind users if they choose to always allow location access [22].
Future work may look into how to actively engage users in
the privacy management without causing habituation [62].
5.3 Developer-Speciﬁed Permission Explana-
tions on iOS
Finding 6: More than half (54.7%) of users did not know
that the explanations in the iOS permission dialogs are
provided by app developers instead of the system.
iOS requires app developers
to provide explanations for all re-
quested permissions, which will
be shown in the permission re-
quest dialogs prompted by the
system. In the interview, partici-
pants were shown the screen of
Camera permission request for
Prisma app on iOS (Figure 7).
The users generally found the explanations helpful in under-
standing the reasons for the request. However, ﬁve partici-
pants mistakenly believed that the explanations were provided
by the system. We asked the same question in survey 1 to
quantify the misunderstanding among iOS users. More than
half (54.7%) of iOS respondents believed that the explana-
tions were provided by the system but not by the app develop-
ers (47.5%), or chose “I don’t know” (7.2%). This indicates
that many iOS users confuse app-speciﬁed explanations with
system-provided information in the permission dialogs.
Figure 7: Camera re-
quest on iOS Prisma app.
The interviewees’ responses show that several reasons
cause their wrong perceptions. First, some users did not be-
lieve that app developers have the incentive to help them make
permission decisions. Second, the appearance of explanations
are consistent across all apps on iOS (e.g. Figure 1(b) and
7). They thought app developers cannot achieve this. Funda-

30th USENIX Security Symposium    761
mentally, this misunderstanding exists because iOS does not
explicitly warn the users that the explanations are provided
by app developers. Even worse the explanations are displayed
in system-provided dialogs without clariﬁcation.
This misunderstanding can cause severe problems since
users may easily believe the explanations are from trusted
and veriﬁed sources. Previous research has shown that the
developer-speciﬁed explanations may contain only partial or
inaccurate information on what data will be accessed [50]. To
avoid confusion, the iOS system may include the sources of
explanations when displaying them in dialogs.
Answer to RQ2: With the limited information provided by
system permission request dialogs, users commonly mis-
perceived the scope of permission groups, and had more
misperceptions for permission groups controlling a larger
number of permissions.
6 Decision Factors
To make permission decisions, users may have concerns
and consider more factors other than current information in
the permission dialogs. To understand users’ concerns and
identify the factors that can affect their permission decisions
(i.e., decision factors), we interviewed 20 mobile users. We
further conducted a quantitative study on 1,200 users to evalu-
ate how different decision factors may change users’ decisions.
The setup of both studies is detailed in Section 3.2 and 3.3.
6.1
Identifying Decision Factors
We deﬁne decision factors as factors that users may take
into account when making permission decisions. In our in-
terview study, we asked the users if they have any concerns
when they make permission decisions and what information
would help mitigate the concerns. Based on the free-form
answers, we concluded ﬁve factors in the coding process.
The codebooks are in Table 10 and Table 11. To make our
study more comprehensive, we also included another factor,
the grant rate of other users, which was studied by previous
work [25,47]. The messages for each decision factor in survey
2 are presented in Table 2 and discussed in §3.3.1.
Finding 7: Besides grant rate studied in previous work [25,
47], users also take other ﬁve factors, including background
access, data transmission, brand reputation, rating, and
review, into account for making permission decisions.
Both internal and external factors can affect permission
decisions: Internal factors (i.e. background access and data
transmission) illustrate when and how an app will access,
transmit or store sensitive data, which can be gathered by
systems through monitoring apps’ behavior. External factors
include brand reputation, rating, review and grant rate. These
factors illustrate users’ opinions on an app or its producer
company. Even though users may have different privacy needs
and preferences, previous users’ opinions can still provide
some insights on privacy usages for the new users. We discuss
each factor and the interview study result as follows.
Background access. This factor concerns whether an app
will access private data when it is running in the background.
It was concerned by nine out of 20 participants. In current
smartphone OSes, after users grant permission, apps can al-
ways access the corresponding data. Therefore, some users
were concerned whether an app would abuse the granted per-
missions to collect private data secretly. Three participants in
our study said that they are afraid of apps tracking their loca-
tions all the time. For example, P14 said “Sometimes when
I’m talking to others, my phone wakes up and Siri asks me do
I need help. Siri, I’m not talking to you. And these home apps,
like Alexa, there is some concern.” This also conforms with
previous ﬁndings that certain background resource accesses
are unexpected and uncomfortable for some users [61, 62].
Data transmission. This factor concerns whether apps
transmit the collected private data to remote servers. Once
the data are transmitted to remote servers, it is unknown how
the data will be used. The data can be stored, leaked, or even
sold to third parties [14, 24]. Eight participants said they are
concerned with this factor. For example, P13: “Like photo-
editing app, I expect that they need photo permission because
that’s what they do. But I am always concerned [that] they
collect my photos and do some other things.”
Brand reputation. This factor indicates whether an app’s
vendor has a good reputation for protecting users’ privacy.
In our interview study, eight participants mentioned that this
factor can impact their permission decisions. Some of them
are more willing to grant permissions when an app’s vendor
has a good reputation in protecting privacy (e.g. P15 “... They
(well-known apps) should be more secure. I know who they
are, what they do and stuff like this. It makes me easier to
give them [requested information]”). However, there is no
gold standard to evaluate companies’ reputation and users’
evaluation standards can also differ from each other. While
many participants mentioned that they are more likely to
trust big famous companies, a few (two) participants also
showed strong distrust in big tech companies. One participant
said that “I don’t trust Facebook at all, they already had
all the information and sold it”. To objectively evaluate a
company’s reputation, we leveraged the information whether
it was known to comply with laws and standards in protecting
users’ privacy in survey 2 (§3.3)
Ratings and Reviews. These two factors refer to ratings
and reviews of an app in app stores. They reﬂect other users’
evaluations of an app’s quality. In our study, 15 participants
said that they usually look at an app’s rating to decide whether
to download it or not. Similarly, rating can also be provided to
assist users’ permission decisions. As P16 puts “The system
can provide something to help users differentiate good apps or
bad apps, [that] is helpful, like ratings”, ratings can help users
assess app qualities and may affect permission decisions.
Reviews may contain more detailed descriptions than rat-
ings but only a small proportion of reviews are useful for
permission [53, 59]. We analyzed the top 1,000 helpful re-

views for a popular free game, “Color Bump 3D”, but found
only 14 reviews are related to permissions. Thus, it is hard for
users to ﬁnd such information from reviews by themselves.
In survey 2, we also presented permission-related reviews to
users to see if reviews are helpful to decision making.
Grant rate. This factor refers to what proportion of previ-
ous users granted a permission to the same app. Previous work
explored the feasibility of crowd-sourcing users’ decisions
to help users in making permission decisions [25, 47]. The
permission settings or privacy expectations from many users
were collected and presented to other users when requesting
permissions, which has a major impact on users’ feelings and
their decisions.
6.2 Factors’ Impact on Permission Decision
We designed three meaningful scenarios to simulate permis-
sion requests from real apps in different contexts. In survey 2,
each respondent was provided with only positive or negative
messages regarding one decision factor in all three scenar-
ios (§3.3.1) and was asked to rate the helpfulness of the factor.
We discuss the major results as follows.
