I use a form field using snake_case, while I use camelCase for the property
name (and for the getter and setter method for this property) in the model.
When the form is submitted, the data is mapped to the model properties:  
the PropertyPathMapper uses the PropertyAccessor to set the value. The
PropertyAccessor uses a camelize() method to find getters and setters for the
property.
But when a validation error occurs on such a property, it is not mapped back
to the form field, because the ViolationMapper compares the camelCased
propertyPath of the model property with the snake_cased propertyPath of the
form field.
This may not be a bug, and people should not use a form field with another
name than the property, (when not explicitly using the property_path option of
the form field).  
But I find it confusing that the mapping used for changing the model based on
the form data works, but mapping the validation errors back to the form field
does not.
