Abstract. User interests can be learned from multiple sources, each of
them presenting only partial facets. We propose an approach to merge
user information from disparate data sources to enable a more complete,
enriched view of user interests. Using our approach, we show that merg-
ing diﬀerent sources results in three times of more interest categories in
user proﬁles than with each single source and that merged proﬁles can
capture much more common interests among a group of users, which is
key to group proﬁling.

Introduction
User interest proﬁles allow businesses and service providers to customize their
services and products to better suit users’ needs and likings. User “footprints”
left in cyberspace, spread across diﬀerent services, contain a large amount of
information about them. While many research works focused on joining user
data across various services of the same type (e.g., online social networks) [2],
aggregating users’ interests at various social networks or websites can only cap-
ture a very specialized, partial view of the user, the persona that user wants the
world to see. A more comprehensive user proﬁle can be captured by combining
user information from diﬀerent types of services. However, it is not trivial to
do so because of each service having its own representation of user data. In the
last few years, Internet users are increasingly interactive and form groups with
shared interests (e.g., meetup.com, Google Hangouts, etc.). Understanding the
common interests of groups of users allows services to be tailored to groups [3].
However, such group proﬁling requires ﬁnding commonality in information from
diﬀerent users, which needs to be done at a semantic level.
The goal of this research work is to represent user interests as they can be
learned from diﬀerent data sources in a single format that can be easily ex-
plained, compared, and combined. We propose a generalized method that ﬂexi-
bly joins user interests from heterogeneous sources of data. Using the proposed
approach, we create user proﬁles from two representative data sets, online social
network (OSN) proﬁles and web browsing traces collected from a Cellular Service
Provider (CSP) and combine them. We show that our approach (i) can create
a richer user proﬁle from heterogeneous information sources, and (ii) can cre-
ate more eﬀective group proﬁle by ﬁnding more common interests among users,
compared to using a single information source.

2 Reconstructing User Interest
We construct a proﬁle Pur of a user, u, analyzing raw data from a single in-
formation source, r. To allow comparing and merging interests across diﬀerent
sources and users (or to group interests of users), interests from each source are
mapped on a category hierarchy H. Then we create the uniﬁed user proﬁle Pu
combining the interest categories in all Pur. In particular, the process includes
the following key steps.
1. Interest Item Extraction. We deﬁne an interest item as a unit of data that
provides information about coherent topics of interests, e.g., a URL requested
by a user in browsing activity logs. We built speciﬁc parsers and noise ﬁlters, for
each data source, to extract a set of interest items Iu for user u.
2. Interest Item Enhancement. In this step we create a vector , Vk, of terms,
tkj , that enrich the semantics of each interest item, ik ∈ Iu, using additional
resources and processes, e.g., using synonyms of words or metadata of URLs.
Vk, is used to aid interest item categorization (next step).
3. Interest-to-Category Mapping. Each interest item, ik, is mapped into an
interest category hierarchy H. Using Machine Learning techniques, we categorize
ik to one or few interest categories {hs}(∈ H).
4. User Proﬁle Creation. A user’s (u) interest proﬁle, Pur, can be created by
aggregating all of his interest categories, represented as a single vector of interest
categories along with the frequencies {(hs, fs)} with which interest items map
on them. We, then, create the uniﬁed user proﬁle Pu combining all Pur of the
user.
3 Experimental Results
Our dataset contains data of 15,428 users. The association between the browsing
traces and OSN’s ID of a user was done with the Mosaic system [4].The browsing
traces, T1 and T2 are 5-day long and were collected from a backbone router of
a major CSP in North America. The categories from the ODP directory [1] are
used as reference interest categories, to which the extracted interest items from
diﬀerent data sources are mapped to.
For each individual user, we study interest items overlap between proﬁles.

Fig. 3. Group coverage
from the two sources. We contrast this result with Figure 2, which plots the
same quantities for two browsing proﬁles created from two periods of time, T1
and T2. The smaller overlap in Figure 1 suggests that a richer proﬁle can be cre-
ated by combining data from disparate sources. The average number of interest
categories per user increases by up to 3 times when the proﬁles are combined.
Group Proﬁle. Now, we show the eﬀectiveness of merging proﬁles when we
want to discover interests commonly shared among a group of users, e.g., gath-
ered in a coﬀee shop. The eﬀectiveness is measured as (i) the number of group
interests, interests shared by more than 50% of users, and (ii) the fraction of users
in the group that have the most popular interest, referred to as top-1 coverage.
The comparison is performed between three types of proﬁles, original OSN and
browsing proﬁles with no categorization, categorized OSN and browsing proﬁles,
and merged categorized proﬁles. We generate 50 groups of 10 and 50 randomly
selected users from our dataset. Table 1 shows that using the categorized &
merged proﬁles results in the highest number of group interests as well as the
best top-1 coverage. Furthermore, we deﬁne coverage for a set of categories to be
the proportion of users for whom at least one of his interests can be found in the
set. In Figure 3 evaluating the number of interest categories required to satisfy
users in the group, we observe that the categorized & merged proﬁles require
only two interest categories to satisfy all members, whereas the uncategorized
proﬁles require 25 categories to be picked to cover interests of all members.
With our results, we illustrated that combining interests from multiple sources
leads to increased availability of user data and higher utility in proﬁling a group
of users.
