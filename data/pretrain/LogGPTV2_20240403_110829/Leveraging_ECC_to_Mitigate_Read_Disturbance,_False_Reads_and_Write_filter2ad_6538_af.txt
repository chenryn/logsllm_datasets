Fig. 13: Energy reliability product of the different policies for six different scenarios.
are more important, WAE and WAP obtain best performance
since they enable better read disturbance mitigation.
VIII. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
In Section VII-B, we showed that a high incidence of
user writes can eliminate the destructive effects of read dis-
turbances. However, heavily read data (e.g., 1000 reads or
more to one write) does yield cumulative error effects due
to read disturbance. Furthermore, results in Section VII-D
show that the energy reliability product for different mitigation
approaches depends on ratios of raw bit error rates pf , pd, and
pw due to circuit parameters in STT-RAM and that the type
of dominant error rate plays a signiﬁcant role in the overall
system performance for different error mitigation policies. We
now explore the energy reliability product of these different
approaches in a systematic way so that pd, pf , and pw can
change in three different modes: high, medium and low. Fig.
13 plots the energy reliability product of different approaches
against three different modes of pd, pf , and pw. For example,
Fig. 13 (a) shows ERP of different approaches when pw has
the highest bit error rate which varies between 10−6 and
10−4 and pd and pf have medium error (varying between
10−8 and 10−6) and low error (varying between 10−10 and
10−8). Similarly, Fig. 13 (b) and (c) show the cases where
pf and pd dominate the error rate, respectively. As before, we
characterize the energy reliability product versus raw bit error
rates for the user read write ratio (a = 99% and b = 0.1%)
and make the following observations:
• When pw is the highest bit error rate in the system as shown
in Fig. 13 (a) [This scenario is relevant to an STT-RAM
system with a reduced write pulse τ to save write energy]:
◦ WAT achieves the best performance against other ap-
proaches because it tends to write back less and avoids the
high pw. However, if the system does experience enough
cells with incorrect data from pw and pd it will write back
to eliminate the accumulated errors.
◦ While WAR typically performs poorly in terms of energy,
but well in terms of reliability, this is an example where
WAR can hurt reliability and energy making it the worst
performing approach. Furthermore, its negative impact on
latency due to the high memory write bandwidth makes
this a poor choice for a system with a high pw.
• When pf is the highest bit error rate in the system as shown
in Fig. 13 (b) [This scenario is relevant to a “standard” single
MTJ STT-RAM system with a standard write pulse]:
◦ When pd is the lowest bit error rate amongst the three,
WAT achieves the best ERP, which is reduced on average
by more than three orders of magnitude compared with
WAE and WAP and also eight orders of magnitude
smaller than WAR.
◦ When pd ≈ pf , WAE, WAP, and WAT have the same
ERP all of which are better than WAR. The destructive
effects of pd degrade the energy reliability advantage of
WAT relative to the case pf >> pd.
• When pd is the highest bit error rate in the system as shown
in Fig. 13 (c) [This scenario is relevant to the dual-MTJ STT-
RAM approach which increases pd and reduces pf and/or
when IR is increased to reduce pf but increases pd]:
◦ WAR has the best ERP among all approaches primarily
because writing back the data block consistently has a
signiﬁcant reliability advantage that outweighs the energy
savings in this scenario.
◦ As long as pw is the lowest bit error rate in the system,
WAT obtains the worst ERP because the combination of
pf and pd have a higher incidence of multiple errors
occurring after a single error was left behind.
◦ If pf is the lowest bit error rate in the system (pd > pw >
pf ), the performance of WAE and WAP exponentially
degrade.
IX. CONCLUSION
Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM)
is one of the leading candidates in emerging memory tech-
nologies. Unfortunately, the relatively unreliable reads of the
STT-RAM due to read disturbances degrades system reliability
and precludes the integration of STT-RAM into the memory
stack. In this paper, we studied three approaches to mitigate
read disturbances for STT-RAM compared to the conservative

these
approach of writing back after every read. Further,
approaches are designed to improve overall memory system
reliability by addressing read disturbance, write faults and
false read errors together. These techniques leverage a single
ECC to cover all
types of faults/errors. In
particular, we considered schemes to write back blocks after
any error is detected (WAE), after a persistent error (due to
read disturbance or write fault) is detected (WAP), or after
multiple errors are detected (WAT). Further, we provided a
description of a Markov modeling approach that evaluates
all three types of errors and generates a single reliability of
the system in terms of uncorrectable bit error rate. Moreover,
we describe energy reliability product metric to be able to
quantitative evaluate the trade-off between system energy and
reliability. Our study concludes the following:
1) WAT, the design that potentially leaves behind some cells
with incorrect data due to faults as long as the number of
errors is less than or equal to an error threshold, achieves
the best energy reliability trade off when the false read error
rate or the write bit error rate is dominant in the system.
2) WAE, the design that writes back data after detecting any
error achieves acceptable reliability and energy levels, as
long as the read disturbance is not dominant.
3) WAP, the design that reads data again after detecting an
error to distinguish between transient and persistent errors
has an energy and reliability that is similar to that of WAE,
as long as the read disturbance is not dominant.
4) WAR does not have a signiﬁcant reliability advantage
over the other policies when the read disturbance is not
dominant in the system. Moreover, WAR has the highest
energy and memory bandwidth overheads among all the
policies.
In summary, we showed qualitatively that WAE, WAP and
WAT provide dramatic improvement in energy consumption
and memory bandwidth overhead (due to additional write-
backs) while eliminating the effects of read disturbance and
retaining near WAR reliability.
