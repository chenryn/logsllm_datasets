User: I would like to force my python app to the front if a condition occurs. I'm using Kubuntu & QT3.1
I've tried setActiveWindow(), but it only flashes the task bar in KDE.
I think Windows has a function bringwindowtofront() for VB.
Is there something similar for KDE?
Assistant: Check if KWin is configured to prevent focus stealing.
There might be nothing wrong with your code -- but we linux people don't like applications bugging us when we work, so stealing focus is kinda frowned upon, and difficult under some window managers.
