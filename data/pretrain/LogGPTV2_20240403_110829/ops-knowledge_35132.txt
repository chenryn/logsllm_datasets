User: How to design a secure login system for a web application?
Assistant: 1. Use safe password rules: Users are required to use passwords with high password complexity, at least 8 characters in length, and contain different types of characters such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 2. Force users to update their passwords: Periodically require users to change their login passwords to maintain security. 3. Use authentication measures: adopt methods such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to improve the security of users logging in to the system. 4. Password encryption storage: save encrypted storage user passwords in the database to avoid password disclosure. 5. Prevent violent attacks: Limit the number of login attempts, lock accounts, add verification codes and other strategies to prevent hackers from cracking passwords violently. 6. Security Verification Information: Encryption and signature measures are used to ensure the security of the identity verification process. 7. Use of secure protocols: HTTPS protocol (SSL/TLS) is used to ensure authentication and encryption of data transmission. 8. Regular Security Updates: The web application is regularly updated to correct security vulnerabilities and other related issues. 9. Monitor abnormal activities: monitor unauthorized login attempts, user activities, abnormal requests, etc., and detect and block abnormal behaviors in time. 10. Security awareness education: Provide security awareness training, introduce common security issues to users, and encourage users to take personal security measures to protect account and personal identity security.
