that can adapt to the nature of the AS being mapped (e.g., Tier-1, Transit, or
Stubs) thanks to its self-adaptative probing strategies and scheduling. The prob-
ing reduction we manage to achieve with our pruning techniques is signiﬁcant
and comes with almost no losses in term of coverage, whatever the kind of AS.
Software Artifacts
The TNT data we used throughout the paper is freely available on Caida web-
site: https://www.caida.org/data/active/ipv4_tnt_dataset.xml. Reproducibil-
ity is therefore quite easy.
Our Anaximander implementation is tunable with a single parameter (the
threshold τ for PR), making it easy to use and ﬂexible. The simulator is devel-
oped in Go, and is available at
https://github.com/Emeline-1/anaximander_simulator.
A Alternative Schedulings
As explained in Sect. 5.4, our grouping of targets by AS has made plateaux
appear during the probing, which can be exploited to prune useless probes from
Anaximander
465
the list of targets in real time. However, even if we do manage to reduce the
plateaux as much as possible while still maintaining a high coverage, a certain
portion of the plateau (shorter or longer depending on the τ parameter) will still
be explored. Indeed, Anaximander is no oracle and cannot know in advance
if the ﬁnal plateau has been reached or if there will still be some discovery
afterwards. Therefore, it needs to explore the plateau before deciding whether it
is safe to skip this portion and jump to the next AS or not. In short, plateaux
are reduced, certainly, but some probes are still wasted on a regular basis in the
middle of the probing.
An alternative scheduling would be to launch the exploration of ASes in
parallel, rather than explore them sequentially. The Plateau Reduction would
still be applied on a per-AS basis, allowing to prune useless probes as usual.
At ﬁrst glance, this new scheduling could have the eﬀect of shifting all bursts
of discovery sooner into the probing campaign, and to relegate all remaining
plateaux towards the end. We have explored two parallel scheduling.
Fig. 7. Comparison of the discovery curves between the diﬀerent scheduling strategies
(AS174 on top, AS4637 bottom). The left column present the results on addresses, the
middle column on links, and the left column on routers.
The ﬁrst one, called greedy scheduling, will halt its probing of an AS as soon
as it encounters a useless probe, and get back to it at a later time in the probing
campaign. This could have, on paper, a beneﬁcial eﬀect on the discovery curve,
by shifting it to the left and limiting the useless probes early on the campaign.
Let us be careful not to confuse this concept with Plateaux Reduction. In this
greedy scheme, Anaximander does not stop exploring an AS entirely at the
ﬁrst useless probe. It will just get back to it later, to try to relegate a potential
466
E. Marechal et al.
plateau towards the end of the probing campaign. The remaining length of the
plateaux are still explored at the end of the discovery curve (and they will still
be reduced by Plateau Reduction).
The second one, called weighted scheduling, attributes a weight to each AS
(based on various criteria), and explores this AS’s address space in successive
batches according to that weight. More precisely, based on the weight of an
AS, Anaximander will explore only a given portion of that AS’s address space
before jumping to the next one. Once Anaximander has browsed over all ASes
in such a way, it will get back to the ﬁrst AS in the list and resume its probing
with yet another batch. The probing of an AS will thus continue in successive
batches, up until all of the AS has been probed, or until the probing is stopped
because of a plateau. For our experiments, we have tested two diﬀerent weighting
functions, one based on the AS’s relative position in the list of ASes, and the
other based on its customer cone size [24]. Each function has been tested with
varying parameters and results are presented for the parameters that yielded the
best results.
Fig. 8. Individual contribution of each of the four main groups (internal preﬁxes, direct
neighbors, one-hop neighbors, and others).
We present our results (Fig. 7) for two ASes of Interest (one Transit and one
Tier 1). Results are not presented for Stub ASes, whose pool of targets is mainly
composed of /24 internal preﬁxes, as the scheduling of probes remains the same
in this particular group. Results for the other ASes in our sample of 25 ASes
lead to the same conclusions but were not presented due to space constraints.
Across all ASes and all types of elements (addresses, links, or routers), the
results are unequivocal: Anaximander’s sequential scheduling always outper-
forms (or is at least equivalent to) the other scheduling strategies. Looking in
more details, we see that the greedy scheduling consistently performs worse than
the other three strategies and can thus be discarded. On the other hand, with
carefully crafted weight functions, we were able to get as close as possible to the
same performance as Anaximander’s current scheduling. More precisely, the
weight function based on the customer cone size generally performs better than
the one on the position of the AS. This is not surprising, as the customer cone
size retains more information than simply the ordering of the AS in the global
AS list.

B Individual Group Contribution
Figure 8a, 8b, and 8c show the contribution of each group of preﬁxes (internals,
direct neighbors, one-hop neighbors, and others) for addresses, links, and routers
respectively, so that the reader can really appreciate what is the cost/coverage
ratio for each group. The same general trend remains: for any type of AS, inter-
nal preﬁxes are the most likely to enable a good ISP coverage for addresses (this
group can even be seen as almost suﬃcient for stub ASes). For Tier-1 however,
probing neighbor ASes becomes necessary to complete the exploration. This is
particularly true for links and routers, that really beneﬁt from probing the neigh-
bors, and where internal preﬁxes are insuﬃcient to cover the whole topology.
