### Apache Airflow Version

- **Kernel:** Darwin Kernel Version 20.4.0
- **Installation Method:** `pip install -e .`

### Issue Description
#### What Happened
I attempted to import a valid connection JSON file using the CLI, but encountered an error.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a JSON file with a valid connection:
   ```sh
   echo '{"sqlite_conn_id": {
       "conn_type": "sqlite",
       "description": "",
       "host": "localhost",
       "login": "",
       "password": null,
       "schema": "/usr/local/airflow/test.db",
       "port": null,
       "extra": ""
     }}' | jq . > connections.json
   ```
2. Import the connection using the Airflow CLI:
   ```sh
   airflow connections import connections.json
   ```

**Error Output:**
```sh
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/matt/src/airflow/venv/bin/airflow", line 33, in <module>
    sys.exit(load_entry_point('apache-airflow', 'console_scripts', 'airflow')())

  File "/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/utils/cli.py", line 91, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/cli/commands/connection_command.py", line 244, in connections_import
    _import_helper(args.file)
  File "/Users/matt/src/airflow/airflow/cli/commands/connection_command.py", line 272, in _import_helper
    key: value for key, value in conn_values.items() if key in allowed_fields
AttributeError: 'Connection' object has no attribute 'items'
```

#### Expected Behavior
The connection should be imported successfully without any errors.

#### Additional Information
- Several tests assume that `load_connections_dict` returns a dictionary of dictionaries.
- In reality, `load_connections_dict` returns a dictionary of `Connection` objects.
- The error occurs when calling `.items()` on a `Connection` object, which does not have this method.

**Relevant Code Snippets:**
- **Test Connection Command:**
  ```python
  # airflow/tests/cli/commands/test_connection_command.py
  # Line 790 in 6f8c204
  # We're not testing the behavior of load_connections_dict, assume
  # it successfully reads JSON, YAML or env
  ```

- **Local Filesystem Secrets:**
  ```python
  # airflow/airflow/secrets/local_filesystem.py
  # Line 278 in 6f8c204
  connection_by_conn_id[key] = _create_connection(key, secret_values)
  ```

**Proposed Fix:**
- This commit appears to address the issue: [MatrixManAtYrService@5159059](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/5159059).
- I started working on a pull request, but while trying to make the tests pass, I became concerned that I might be on the wrong path. Therefore, I decided to create an issue instead.
