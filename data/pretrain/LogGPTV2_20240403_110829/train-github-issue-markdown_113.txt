**What happened** :
Tried to import valid connection json via the cli. Got an error:
    ❯ echo '{"sqlite_conn_id": {
        "conn_type": "sqlite",
        "description": "",
        "host": "localhost",
        "login": "",
        "password": null,
        "schema": "/usr/local/airflow/test.db",
        "port": null,
        "extra": ""
      }}' | jq . > connections.json
    ❯ airflow connections import connections.json

Several of the tests assume that `load_connections_dict` returns a dict of
dicts  
airflow/tests/cli/commands/test_connection_command.py
Line 790 in 6f8c204
|  # We're not testing the behavior of load_connections_dict, assume
successfully reads JSON, YAML or env  
---|---  
Actually, `load_connections_dict` returns a dict of `Connection`s  
airflow/airflow/secrets/local_filesystem.py
Line 278 in 6f8c204
|  connection_by_conn_id[key] = _create_connection(key, secret_values)  
---|---  
When we call `.items()` on the `Connection`, it fails.
**What you expected to happen** :
The import is sucessful.
**How to reproduce it** :
See commands above.
**Anything else we need to know** :
This commit fixes it (I think): MatrixManAtYrService@`5159059`
I started making a PR, but while trying to make the tests pass I started to
worry that I was on the wrong path, so I made an issue instead.
