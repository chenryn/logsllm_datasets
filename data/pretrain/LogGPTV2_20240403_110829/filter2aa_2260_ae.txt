### Contacts for Each Area
Contacts for each area will be provided to encourage peer-to-peer “cross-pollination” of best practices.

### Statewide Plans
Urban and metropolitan areas will be asked to play an active role in the development of Statewide Interoperable Communications Plans, as required by December 31, 2007, under the FY 2006 Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP).

### Conclusion
The scorecard results show that urban and metropolitan areas have made significant progress in developing their tactical interoperable communications capabilities. As documented in the SAFECOM Baseline Assessment, the technology exists to enable interoperable communications, but these solutions are often not available regionally and are far from seamless in many areas. Therefore, continued training and the use of available technical solutions, along with their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), are critical to operational success.

In areas that have demonstrated success at the tactical, command-level of communications interoperability, there is still work to be done. While multi-agency communications have been addressed within many jurisdictions, regionalizing existing communications strategies to identify longer-term interoperability goals across multiple jurisdictions and levels of government remains a challenge.

### Urban/Metropolitan Area

**January 2007**
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecards**

#### Appendix A: Urban Area Scorecard
The tables in this appendix outline the results for Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Usage, and Governance for the 48 urban areas that developed and exercised Tactical Interoperable Communications Plans (TICPs). The results represent a summary assessment of each Continuum element, taking into account critical sub-elements identified in the Interoperability Maturity Measurement Model, which was developed as part of the SAFECOM National Baseline Assessment. This approach ensures consistency in the measurement models applied to various Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiatives.

- **SOPs Sub-Elements:**
  1. Policies, practices, and procedures
  2. Command and control

- **Usage Sub-Elements:**
  - Frequency of use and familiarity with interoperability solutions

- **Governance Sub-Elements:**
  1. Decision-making groups
  2. Agreements
  3. Strategic planning
  4. Interoperability funding
  5. Leadership

Each score can be defined as early, intermediate, established, or advanced implementation of the given element. Below are general definitions for each score:

| **Implementation Level** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Advanced Implementation** | First responders regularly and seamlessly utilize interoperability solutions. The region demonstrated successful multi-agency communications during exercises, including state, federal, and support organizations. |
| **Established Implementation** | First responders use interoperability solutions regularly and easily. The region demonstrated successful multi-agency communications during exercises, which may have included state, federal, and support organizations. |
| **Intermediate Implementation** | First responders use interoperability solutions regularly and demonstrated the ability to achieve multi-agency communications despite some challenges during exercises. |
| **Early Implementation** | Interoperable communications solutions are rarely used for multi-agency communication, and difficulties were encountered in achieving interoperability during exercises. |

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
| **Implementation Level** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Advanced Implementation** | Regional SOPs, reviewed through the TICP process, are in place and regularly used by included agencies. NIMS procedures are well established among all agencies and disciplines. All procedures were effectively utilized during exercises. |
| **Established Implementation** | Existing regional SOPs were reviewed and included in the TICP, and are in use by included agencies. NIMS-compliant command and control has been instituted by all agencies and disciplines in the region. Despite minor issues, all SOPs were successfully demonstrated during exercises. |
| **Intermediate Implementation** | Some existing SOPs were incorporated in the TICP, and steps have been taken to institute these interoperability procedures among included agencies. Formal NIMS/ICS procedures are in place, but understanding varies among agencies, leading to some issues during exercises. |
| **Early Implementation** | Region-wide SOPs were developed and formalized for the first time through the TICP but have not been disseminated to all included agencies. Some elements of NIMS/ICS procedures for command and control are in place, but understanding varies among agencies and was an area of difficulty during exercises. |

### Governance
| **Implementation Level** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Advanced Implementation** | Decision-making bodies proactively look to expand membership to ensure representation from broader public support disciplines and other levels of government, while updating their agreements and strategic plan on a regular basis. |
| **Established Implementation** | Formal agreements outline the roles and responsibilities of a decision-making group, which has an agreed-upon strategic plan that addresses sustainable funding for collective, regional interoperable communications needs. |
| **Intermediate Implementation** | Some formal agreements exist, and informal agreements are in practice among members of a decision-making group. Regional strategic and budget planning processes are beginning to be put in place. |
| **Early Implementation** | Decision-making groups are informal and do not yet have a strategic plan in place to guide collective communications interoperability goals and funding. |

### Note
It should be noted that many of the urban areas have progressed in developing interoperable communications capabilities beyond the point at which the information for the scorecards was collected. DHS recognizes the ongoing work in each area and appreciates the participation of areas in providing feedback and comments to their scorecards. To the extent possible, comments were incorporated into the scorecards included in this appendix.

### Phoenix, AZ
**Tactical Interoperable Communications Scorecard Summary**

- **Governance:** Intermediate Implementation
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Established Implementation
- **Usage:** Established Implementation

**Phoenix Urban Area (UA)** includes the counties of Maricopa and Pinal and the major cities of Phoenix, Mesa, Scottsdale, Glendale, Tempe, Chandler, Gilbert, and Peoria. Smaller communities included in the UA are Goodyear, Fountain Hills, Litchfield Park, Anthem, Sun Lakes, Sun City, Sun City West, Surprise, and Tolleson.

**Governance: Intermediate Implementation**
- The Phoenix UA is beginning to establish communications interoperability as a priority, as demonstrated by the consideration for interoperability in equipment procurement.
- The UA established the Interoperability Subcommittee in April 2005 to support the development of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and overall communications coordination.
- The formation of this governance group represents a positive first step in formalizing attention to communications interoperability issues.
- It was unclear whether a charter exists for the Interoperability Subcommittee, although the group has voting rights, indicating a level of formality.
- An oversight group formed as part of the Department of Justice (DoJ) 25 Cities project is planned to be folded into the Interoperability Subcommittee to improve coordination and efficiency of governance groups, as the two groups include many of the same members.
- The regional agencies have some formal agreements (e.g., DoJ 25 Cities/high-level agreements between Phoenix and Mesa), but indicated that overall the partnerships were informal in nature.
- The continued development of documented agreements would support the formalization of these partnerships to ensure clear roles and responsibilities relating to communications interoperability issues and decisions.
- Phoenix officials indicated that they had developed a strategic plan that included broad representation from public support disciplines (e.g., public works, transportation, and 36 area hospitals).
- The strategic plan is fully developed but has not yet been fully adopted and accepted by participating agencies. This strategy, as it gets adopted, can also support the prioritization of goals so that funding can be planned accordingly.
- Currently, interoperable communications funding is provided primarily through federal grants because there does not appear to be a specific region-wide plan for long-term interoperability funding.
- The Phoenix Interoperability Subcommittee participates in the state’s communication planning group, which could serve as a basis for further developing leadership relations across local and state agencies.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish charters to encourage formal membership of decision-making groups (including all first responder agencies).
- Continue to consolidate the existing DoJ 25 Cities committee into the Urban Area Security Initiative subcommittee.
- Document and formalize necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding), including local, state, federal, and tribal partnerships, to support regional interoperability.
- Encourage full adoption and acceptance of the strategic plan by all participants and align local, state, and tribal strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met.
- Encourage the development of a regional interoperability funding strategy, including the identification of long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources (in addition to grants).
