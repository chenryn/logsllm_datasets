Conclusion    
The scorecard results show that urban/metropolitan areas have come a long way in developing 
their tactical interoperable communications capabilities.  As documented in the SAFECOM 
Baseline Assessment, technology exists to permit interoperable communications, but solutions are 
often not available regionally and are far from seamless in many areas.  Therefore, continued 
training and use of available technical solutions and their SOPs are critical to operational success.  
In areas that have demonstrated success at the tactical, command-level of communications 
interoperability, there is still work to be done.  Multi-agency communications has been addressed 
within many of these jurisdictions, but regionalizing the existing communications strategies to 
identify longer term interoperability goals across multiple jurisdictions and levels of government still 
needs to be addressed.

The tables included in this appendix outline the results developed for Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP), Usage, and Governance for the 48 urban areas that developed and exercised 
TICPs.  The results represent the summary assessment of each Continuum element taking into 
account critical “sub-elements” identified in the Interoperability Maturity Measurement Model 
developed as part of the SAFECOM National Baseline Assessment.  The Baseline approach to 
defining the aspects of communications interoperability was leveraged to ensure consistency in the 
measurement models applied to various Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiatives.   
In the case of SOPs, the sub-elements include: 1) policies, practices, and procedures and 
2) command and control.  Usage focuses on the frequency of use and familiarity with 
interoperability solutions.  Governance focuses on five core sub-elements including: 1) decision-
making groups, 2) agreements, 3) strategic planning, 4) interoperability funding, and 5) leadership.   
Each score can be defined as early, intermediate, established, or advanced implementation of the 
given element.  Below, general definitions for each score are provided.

It should be noted that many of the urban areas have progressed in developing interoperable 
communications capabilities past the point at which the information for the scorecards was 
collected.  DHS recognizes the ongoing work in each area and appreciates the participation that 
areas had in providing feedback and comments to their scorecards.  To the extent possible, 
comments were incorporated into the scorecards included in this appendix.

The Phoenix UA is beginning to establish communications interoperability as a priority in the area as 
demonstrated by the consideration for interoperability included in equipment procurement.  The UA 
established the Interoperability Subcommittee in April 2005 to support the development of the Tactical 
Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), as well as overall communications coordination.  The formation 
of this governance group represents a positive first step in formalizing attention to communications 
interoperability issues. It was unclear whether a charter exists for the Interoperability Subcommittee, 
although the group has voting rights, which indicates a level of formality.  An oversight group formed as a 
part of the Department of Justice (DoJ) 25 Cities project is planned to be folded into the Interoperability 
Subcommittee to improve coordination and efficiency of governance groups since the two groups include 
many of the same members.  The regional agencies have some formal agreements (e.g., DoJ 25 Cities/high-
level agreements between Phoenix and Mesa), but indicated that overall the partnerships were informal in 
nature.  The continued development of documented agreements would support the formalization of these 
partnerships to ensure clear roles and responsibilities relating to communications interoperability issues and 
decisions.  Phoenix officials indicated that they had developed a strategic plan that included broad 
representation from public support disciplines (e.g., public works, transportation, and 36 area hospitals).  The 
strategic plan is fully developed, but has not yet been fully adopted and accepted by participating agencies. 
This strategy, as it gets adopted, can also support the prioritization of goals so that funding can be planned 
accordingly.   Currently, interoperable communications funding is provided primarily through federal grants 
because there does not appear to be a specific regionwide plan for long-term interoperability funding.  The 
Phoenix Interoperability Subcommittee participates in the state’s communication planning group, which 
could serve as a basis for further developing leadership relations across local and state agencies.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Establish charters to encourage formal membership of decision-making group (including all first 
responder agencies) 
• 
Continue to consolidate existing DoJ 25 Cities committee into the Urban Area Security Initiative 
subcommittee 
• 
Document and formalize the necessary agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding), including local, 
state, federal, and tribal partnerships, to support partnerships on regional interoperability 
• 
Encourage full adoption and acceptance of the strategic plan by all participants and align local, state, and 
tribal strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Encourage development of a regional interoperability funding strategy, including the identification of 
long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources (in addition to grants)
