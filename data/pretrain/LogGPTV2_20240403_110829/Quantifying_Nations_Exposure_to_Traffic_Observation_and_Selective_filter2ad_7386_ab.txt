its addresses in the country, and foreign otherwise. The vast majority (97.4%) of
ASes are classiﬁed as domestic in one country, with the remaining small fraction
being classiﬁed as foreign in every country. In fact, 89.8% of ASes have all of
their address in a single country, and 98.6% have a strict majority of addresses
in one country.
4 Transit Inﬂuence Metric
We deﬁne the transit inﬂuence CT IM (AS, C) ∈ [0, 1] using a set of BGP moni-
tors M as

where w(m) is monitor m’s weight (Sect. 4.1) among the set of monitors
(Sect. 4.2); onpath(AS, m, p) is true if AS is present on a preferred path observed
by monitor m to a preﬁx p, and m is not contained within AS itself (Sect. 4.2);
a(p, C) is the number of addresses in preﬁx p geolocated to country C; A(C) is
the total number of IP addresses geolocated to country C; and d(AS, p, m) is
the number of AS-level hops between AS and preﬁx p as viewed by monitor m
(Sect. 4.1).
We illustrate CTI’s use in Fig. 1, with CTI values for a toy example with
three transit ASes and four origin ASes, in a country with eight /24 preﬁxes: the
transit AS on the right has the highest CTI, since it serves the most addresses
(half of the country), followed by the transit AS on the left (3/8) and the AS
in the center (1/8). Note that the top AS has a CTI of 0, because it hosts
the BGP monitor from which the set of routes used in this toy example are
learned—hence, onpath(ASt, m, p) is always false for that AS. Should that AS
not be the host of the BGP monitor (or be seen on these routes through another
monitor), it would have a CTI of 0.5—transit inﬂuence over the entire country
as an indirect transit provider (distance 2 from the preﬁxes).
Note that originating addresses directly does not grant an AS transit inﬂu-
ence, as our focus is on identifying ASes that carry traﬃc to destinations outside
of their network.
Quantifying Nations’ Exposure to Traﬃc Observation

4.1 CTI Components
We explain the rationale for the various factors in Eq. 1 in the following subsec-
tions.
Indirect Transit Discount. As the number of AS-level hops from the origin
increases, so too does the likelihood that there exist alternative paths towards the
same origin AS of which we have no visibility (e.g., backup links, less-preferred
paths). Figure 2 shows this limitation in visibility for a toy example with a single
origin AS. There, given the location of BGP monitor C we see the AS-level chain
in black, erroneously concluding that the origin AS has a single direct transit
provider and two indirect transit providers. In reality, there exists another set
of both direct and indirect transit providers (the AS-level chain in light gray).
We miss all these paths given that we do not have a monitor in any neighbor of
a light-gray AS (such as that marked with a plus sign). In this example we miss
backup links of the origin AS, as well as preferred links of the origin’s direct
transit provider, and a backup link of both indirect transit providers.
As a coarse mechanism aimed at mitigating this limited visibility, we dis-
count the inﬂuence of transit providers in proportion to the AS-level distance
from the origin: we apply a discount factor as 1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/k, where k is the
number of AS-level hops from the origin AS. In practice, that means we do not
discount the measurements of direct transit providers, as there the probability
of missing a backup or less-preferred link is lowest. We note that this heuristic
yields a conservative estimate of the observation opportunities of an indirect
transit provider over traﬃc ﬂowing towards a country.
Prioritizing AS Diversity. ASes can host more than one BGP monitor. In
fact, more than 20 ASes in RIPE RIS and RouteViews host multiple monitors;
for instance, AS3257-GTT hosts ﬁve. In order to favor a topologically-diverse
view (given the available observations), if more than one monitor from the same
AS sees an announcement for the same preﬁx, we discount their observations to
limit the inﬂuence of monitor ASes with multiple monitors. Formally, the weight
for each monitor m’s observation of a preﬁx is w(m) = 1/n, where n is the
number of BGP monitors in the AS that see an announcement of that preﬁx.
4.2 Filtering ASes
To correct for the limited, non-uniform coverage of the BGP monitors that collect
our table dumps, we apply a number of ﬁlters to the set of paths over which we
compute CTI.
Provider-Customer AS Filter. BGP monitors by deﬁnition collect paths
from the AS hosting the monitor to the origin AS. Therefore, we always exclude
the AS hosting the BGP monitor from the path to avoid inﬂating their transit
inﬂuence. Further, we employ a heuristic that attempts to consider only the
652
A. Gamero-Garrido et al.
portion of the path relevant to the origin preﬁx, and ignore the portion dictated
by the monitor’s topological location.
The intuition behind our ﬁlter is that, from the perspective of the origin
AS, there is a “hill” above it capped by the last observed provider-customer
(p2c, i.e., transit) link, with traﬃc ﬂowing from the hill’s peak down towards
the origin. The transit AS in that link is the highest point in the path we want
to keep, as it directs traﬃc towards its customer (and its customer’s customers,
if applicable). After reaching that topological peak, we discard any other AS
present in the path. The remaining path would then include the origin AS, its
direct or indirect transit provider at the topological peak, and any other ASes
appearing between the origin AS and the direct or indirect transit provider. Note
that this ﬁlter excludes peers of the transit provider at the peak—appearing
between the topological peak and the AS hosting the BGP monitor—since we
only apply CTI in transit-dominant countries, and therefore these peers are
unlikely to be central to the country’s connectivity.
Formally, for the analysis presented in this paper, we reﬁne onpath(ASt, m, p)
to be true only if the path observed at monitor m has at least one inferred p2c
link where the customer is either the origin of p or closer to it than ASt, i.e.,
we discard paths where there is no topological peak from the perspective of the
origin. This heuristic discards 0.2% of the paths observed by our monitors. In
the median country we discard 0.2% of paths using this ﬁlter, with 0.3% being
the average case. In all countries we keep over 98.6% of paths.
This ﬁlter ensures that at least one AS (the inferred customer of the transit
AS) relies on at least one other AS (the inferred transit provider) for transit
from and towards the core of the Internet. As we aim to measure transit inﬂu-
ence, these business relationships are an important source of information: merely
being directly connected to an AS path that reaches the origin AS in a given
country does not necessarily make an AS inﬂuential; being a direct provider of
the origin, or of an AS closer to the origin, lends more conﬁdence to our inference
of inﬂuence3.
CTI Outlier Filtering. Finally, we ﬁlter BGP-monitor-location noise by
removing outlier estimates of transit inﬂuence—both overestimates and under-
estimates resulting from the AS hosting a BGP monitor being topologically too
close or too far from the origin AS—to get an accurate assessment of transit inﬂu-
ence towards that origin. We implement a ﬁlter recently proposed for another
AS-topology metric (AS hegemony [31], see Sect. 9). Speciﬁcally, we compute the
CTI of each transit provider ASt using BGP monitors from each monitor-hosting
ASh independently, as CT Im(ASh)(ASt, C), where m(ASh) is the set of monitors
within ASh. We determine which potentially-biased ASh have gathered obser-
vations producing CT Im(ASh)(ASt, C) values in the bottom and top 10% of all
values for that transit provider in that country and disregard all paths observed
by monitors hosted in these potentially-biased ASh. As in [31], we implement

behind the CTI model.

outlier ﬁltering only where we have observations of CT Im(ASh)(ASt, C) from 10
or more ASh, which occurs for 58.4% of transit AS-country pairs in our sample
(a single AS can operate in multiple countries).
5 Country-Level Transit
In this section we present the results of applying our CTI metric to the transit
ecosystem of 75 countries with little-to-no international peering. (We describe
our method for selecting these countries in Sect. 6.) We provide a high-level
characterization of the transit ecosystem in each country by comparing the CTI
scores of the top-5 ASes ranked by CTI (Sect. 5.1), as well as a set of ASes that
appear in the top 5 of many countries (at least 10). Our hypothesis is that these
countries show diﬀerent transit proﬁles as a consequence of the socioeconomic
and geopolitical diversity of the sample: from high exposure to observation, where
one AS is the most inﬂuential transit provider and others are very marginal, to
less exposed countries with an ensemble of ASes with similar values of CTI.
Investigating the companies operating the ASes with high CTI, we ﬁnd two
prominent groups of organizations: submarine cable operators (Sect. 5.2) and
state-owned providers (Sect. 5.3). For the former, their operation of physical
infrastructure connected to the country may underpin their high transit inﬂu-
ence. With regards to state-owned ASes, providing transit may give govern-
ments the ability to expand their footprint beyond addresses they originate,
e.g., through a state-owned broadband provider. In some cases, state ownership
of a transit provider may follow their investment in a submarine cable or land-
ing station, while in others it may reﬂect the government’s intention to enact
censorship. We limit our analysis to the discovery of the transit footprint of the
state, without delving into the underlying motives.
5.1 CTI Distribution Across Countries
In this subsection we present an overview of the CTI distribution across coun-
tries. Countries with a top-heavy distribution of CTI values are particularly
exposed to speciﬁc networks. Other nations with a more ﬂat distribution signal

an ecosystem that is less exposed to prominent transit ASes. Figure 3 shows the
distribution of CTI values for ASes ranked in the top 5 by CTI in each country.
In 51 countries, the top-ranked AS has CTI ≥ 0.3, signaling high exposure to
observation and tampering by that speciﬁc network.
The distribution of CTI rapidly declines across AS rank, with the median
halving from the ﬁrst to the second position. In 54 countries, CTI declines by
over 30% from the top-ranked AS to its successor; the average and median decline
across all countries are 50% and 47%. This suggests that in the vast majority
of countries in our sample, a single AS is particularly prominent in terms of its
capabilities to observe or tamper with traﬃc.

countries we study.
Individual Nations. Results for the full set of countries we study4 are included
in Fig. 4. We discuss several representative cases below.
Most Exposed Countries. Only four countries have a top-ranked AS with
a CTI over 0.75: Cuba, Libya, Sierra Leone, and the Solomon Islands (a small
island nation). Cuba appears to have the most-exposed transit ecosystem5,
in which the top-ranked AS has CTI of 0.96. Because CTI discounts indirect
transit—and the top AS monopolizes observed, direct connectivity—the CTI of
