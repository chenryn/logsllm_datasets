### 4.3.2 Insufficient Budget

Six of our manager participants stated that they had sufficient budgets for their SOCs; however, some expressed budgetary concerns or constraints. In some cases, the budget must be approved by higher organizational authorities, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies.

- **P13's Experience:** P13 experienced a critical issue where a key appliance detected numerous incidents but was not inline, meaning it could not block malicious activity. The participant stated:
  > "We have a really good appliance that detects a huge number of incidents in our environment; however, the appliance is not inline, so it does not block the activity. We can see the activity, but we are still allowing it. That is a huge issue, and it is because the budget has not been approved to move it inline."

- **Training and Travel Budgets:** Organizations with multiple SOCs around the world require travel budgets for employee training and collaboration. P14 mentioned a limited budget for training and international travel, while P13 stated:
  > "The only budget problem that we have was on training and international travels. That would be the only place that we are not well funded."

- **Risk-Based Decisions:** Organizations often make risk-based decisions due to limited budgets. P14 argued:
  > "I think we always want more, but there is a risk-based decision. We cannot spend a billion dollars on cybersecurity. We are not a tool company. We are a financial institution, so we have to balance sometimes."

- **Burnout and Financial Burden:** P10 discussed the importance of team-building activities and time off to reduce burnout, noting:
  > "We have happy hours, so everyone goes out to have some drinks, eat dinner outside. Kind of, go interact with your peers, it is really a team-building thing here and there. [...] I also recommend employees to take some time off when they work six or seven weeks straight. [...] As long as you keep them engaged, they tend to have less burnout, but again it is a financial burden, but we are very lucky because we have the ability to do that."

### 4.3.3 Challenge of Scaling SOC Technologies

A scalable SOC allows for the integration of new technology or the removal of existing technology without major complications. All manager participants stated that their SOC is scalable, but three participants (P5, P14, and P15) noted that integrating new technologies can be challenging.

- **Complexity and Integration:** P14 described the complexity of integrating new technology into an active SOC, using an analogy:
  > "We are flying a plane, and we also need to change the engine while we are flying that plane. So, sometimes, that is the balance we need to maintain."

### 5. Actionable Advice and Research Opportunities

Based on our findings, we suggest that SOCs, especially managers, follow up on the identified issues and communicate with their analysts regarding automation, evaluation metrics, and tool functionality. For example, managers should clearly describe and justify the metrics they use, which can help ease the feeling of injustice among analysts and provide valuable feedback.

#### 5.1 Asset Discovery and Registration

Analysts and managers agree that low visibility of devices and network topology is a significant issue. A high level of visibility is vital for SOC success. One participant suggested the need for a mechanism to discover every asset on the network, including previously unknown assets. Developing such a mechanism is challenging due to factors like industry sectors, user profiles, organizational structure, and network size.

#### 5.2 Effective Education

SOC training programs, whether internal or commercial, are critical for fulfilling the organization’s security mission. However, our results show that SOC analysts are not satisfied with their current training. Research studies on virtual environments for learning and security education, such as CyberCIEGE and i-tee, have shown promising results. The academic community should investigate if virtual interactive learning environments can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of SOC employee education.

#### 5.3 Improved SOC Security Metrics

There is ongoing research on measuring security using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. However, creating suitable metrics specific to SOCs remains an open area of research. One direction is to investigate ways to predict the longevity of vulnerabilities in different systems within an organization’s SOC.

### 6. Limitations and Future Work

#### 6.1 Data Sensitivity

Data flowing through the SOC is sensitive, and some participants may not have responded truthfully. To address this, we informed participants that all questions were optional and that they could choose not to answer if uncomfortable.

#### 6.2 Generalization

Our results may not be generalizable to all SOCs due to the limited number of interviews. Our participants came from various industries, and we created questions to cover all aspects of SOCs.

#### 6.3 Participant Recruitment

Some participants from large, well-known organizations may have declined due to limited time. We used Snowball Sampling to recruit participants, which may have introduced selection bias.

#### 6.4 Sentiment Analysis

Future research could apply sentiment analysis to the transcripts to understand participants’ emotional responses to various topics.

#### 6.5 Best Practices vs. Reality Analysis

We found discrepancies between best practices and reality. Future research could compare best practices with real-world experiences to determine their advantages.

#### 6.6 Pair Analysis

We discovered contradictory responses from participants in the same organization but in different roles. Future research could recruit more participants to investigate matches and mismatches among pairs.

#### 6.7 Industry Sector Analysis

Different SOCs from various industries can have distinct problems. Future work can focus on each type of SOC and analyze their unique issues.

#### 6.8 Internal vs. Outsourced SOC Analysis

Outsourced SOCs face more visibility and response speed issues compared to internal SOCs. Future work can focus on each type of SOC and analyze their unique issues.

#### 6.9 Tiered vs. Non-tiered SOC Analysis

Future work can independently study each structure and analyze their unique advantages and disadvantages.

#### 6.10 Security Tool Analysis

Future work can conduct a deeper qualitative and quantitative analysis of specific tools and toolsets commonly used in SOCs.
