4.3.2 Insufficient Budget
Six of our manager participants stated that they had sufficient
budget for their SOCs; however, some of our manager participants
stated their budgetary concerns or constraints.
In some cases, the budget must be approved by organizational
powers above the SOC manager. P13 experienced a problem with
their superiors. The participant stated that they had a critical plan
that they put on hold and said:
We have a really good appliance that detects a huge number
of incidents in our environment; however, the appliance is not
inline, so it does not block the activity. We can see the activity,
but we are still allowing it. That is a huge issue, and it is
because the budget has not been approved to move it inline.
Organizations can have several SOCs around the world. In these
cases, employees require a travel budget to visit other SOCs and
train employees who work in those SOCs. P14 stated that they have
a limited budget for training and international travel. P13 stated
that they do not have enough funding for employee training and
international travels. The participant said:
The only budget problem that we have was on training and
international travels. That would be the only place that we are
not well funded.
In some situations, organizations make risk-based decisions because
they do not have an unlimited budget for their SOC. P14 argued
that industry focus also plays a role and said:
I think we always want more, but there is a risk-based decision.
We cannot spend a billion dollars on cybersecurity. We are not
a tool company. We are a financial institution, so we have to
balance sometimes.
Burnout is a prominent issue for SOCs that is also related to lack
of budget. One of our manager participants, P10, discussed this by
stating:
We have happy hours, so everyone goes out to have some drinks,
eat dinner outside. Kind of, go interact with your peers, it is
really team building thing here and there. [...] I also recommend
employees to take some time off when they work six or seven
weeks straight. [...] As long as you keep them engaged, they
tend to have less burnout, but again it is a financial burden,
but we are very lucky because we have the ability to do that.
4.3.3 Challenge of Scaling SOC Technologies
A SOC is scalable if it allows the integration of new technology or
the removal of existing technology without major complications.
All manager participants stated that their SOC is scalable and
integrating new technology provides benefits; however, three par-
ticipants (P5, P14, and P15), added that, in some cases, it was chal-
lenging to add new technologies to the SOC.
Regarding these challenges, P14 mentioned the complexity and
the difficulty of integrating new technology into their currently
active SOC. As an analogy, the participant said:
We are flying a plane, and we also need to change the en-
gine while we are flying that plane. So, sometimes, that is the
balance we need to maintain.
5 ACTIONABLE ADVICE AND RESEARCH
OPPORTUNITIES
In this paper, we identified mismatched issues, and we see our work
as the first step toward resolving these issues. We suggest SOCs,
especially managers, follow-up on our findings and communicate
with their analysts in terms of automation, evaluation metrics, and
tool functionality. For example, for evaluation metrics, we suggest
that SOC managers describe the metrics that they use to their
employees and justify the reason why they use those metrics. This
way, managers will not only receive valuable feedback from their
analysts but also ease the feeling of unjustness that their analysts
are experiencing. Based on our interview data, we envision three
research opportunities regarding SOCs.
of learning, and fortify the self-efficacy of SOC employees by simu-
lating a real SOC environment.
Furthermore, our participants stated that phishing attacks are
still the most prevalent attacks in organizations. These virtual envi-
ronments might also be useful for increasing security awareness
against phishing attacks by interactively simulating their conse-
quences.
5.3 Improved SOC Security Metrics
As Herley et al. [21] stated in their recent work, there has been
significant work on properly measuring security, using both quan-
titative and qualitative metrics; however, “progress here has been
slow.” Researchers are still trying to create better, more suitable
metrics to measure security. However, security metrics that are
specific to SOCs are still an open area of research. One specific
research direction is to investigate ways to predict the longevity of
a vulnerability in different systems of an organization’s SOC.
5.1 Asset Discovery and Registration
As seen in Table 2, analysts and managers are in agreement that a
low level of visibility of devices and network topology is a signifi-
cant issue. Therefore, a high level of visibility is vital toward SOC
success because a SOC cannot prevent an incident that happens in
an area that it cannot see.
As one of our participants mentioned in Section 4.1.1, SOCs
need a way to discover every asset that is active on the network,
including previously-unknown assets that are newly connected to
the network.
To develop such a mechanism is challenging due to many factors
such as different industry sectors, the user profile, organizational
structure, size of the network, infrastructure, and type of the SOC.
The research community should explore such scenarios and suggest
ways either to develop novel approaches that would apply to every
SOC or be adaptable for each scenario.
5.2 Effective Education
SOC training programs, internal or commercial, are critical to fulfill-
ing the organization’s security mission, however our results show
that SOC analysts are not satisfied with their training programs.
There have been many research studies that focused on the
efficiency and effectiveness of students’ learning in virtual environ-
ments and yielded promising results [9, 11, 23, 35].
Moreover, there were a few research studies specifically on se-
curity education, including a game in the form of an interactive
environment, CyberCIEGE, to explore the effectiveness of such envi-
ronments on learning [26], and another study in which researchers
proposed an open-source platform called "i-tee" for simulating se-
curity attacks in a virtual sandbox environment [14].
It is also worth mentioning that the United States Army is cur-
rently testing a virtual environment for “persistent and realistic
training” [1, 7].
The unique environment of a SOC is the perfect candidate for
such investigations. The academic community should investigate if
virtual interactive learning environments can alleviate the current
issues regarding employee education, help to improve the efficiency
6 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Our study has a number of limitations, and in this section we
describe some of those limitations, how the limitations impact
the study and results, and the techniques we applied to reduce
the impact of those limitations. We also discuss future research
directions from this work.
Data Sensitivity. Data that flows through the SOC is sensitive, and
the consequences of it being leaked are severe. Given the sensitivity
of the topics covered in this research study, it is possible that some
participants may not have responded truthfully.
To prevent this from happening, we informed the participants
that all questions are optional, and they are free not to answer if
they do not feel comfortable answering them before and during the
interviews. We believe that most of our responses are accurate, and
participants would choose not to answer in the first place if they
think they cannot or will not respond truthfully.
Generalization. Another limitation of our research study is that
our results may not be generalized to all SOCs, as we had a limited
number of interviews. It is worth mentioning that our participants’
SOCs are from industry sectors including airline, construction, edu-
cation, financial services, information technology, and professional
services, which covers a wide range of organizations. Furthermore,
to improve the applicability and exhaustiveness of our results, we
created questions that would cover all aspects of SOCs.
Participant Recruitment. Some of the participants were from
large, well-known organizations in which employees have limited
time for such research studies. We are worried that some SOC pro-
fessionals may have declined our request for participation because
they wanted to learn the immediate benefit that they will get from
this study, which we could not provide at the time. To prevent
this issue, we added the following to our recruitment email: “If
this research study is carried out successfully and we receive conclu-
sive results, the limitations of current SOCs will be identified. This
outcome may provide potential benefits to the individuals that par-
ticipate in this study, given that they are part of their organization’s
SOC”.
We used Snowball Sampling to recruit six of our participants
with the goal of recruiting a manager and an analyst from the same
organization. In the case that the SOC manager referred to one of
their analysts as a participant for the study, the manager chose one
of their analysts from a number of analysts. Because of this reason,
this selection might have been biased, and also the sample might
not represent all of the analysts in that organization. This selection
bias and the issue of representativeness does not exist when an
analyst referred to their manager as a potential participant since
there is only one SOC manager.
Sentiment Analysis. The participants of our study conveyed
sentiments through interviews, which can be observed by their
tones, actions, and speech. For example, when we asked about the
reporting mechanism, one participant responded:
Let me explain the setup because it is a little bit complicated
(sigh).
Future research could apply sentiment analysis to the transcripts
to understand participants’ emotional responses to various topics.
Best Practices vs. Reality Analysis. We found multiple realities
that are different from the best practices suggested by the security
community. For example, while Zimmerman et al. recommends
consolidating computer network defense under one group [55]
(Chapter 3), some organizations have “several institutions” to co-
work on the response of incident reports, and some organizations
even have “two SOCs.” Future research could conduct a comparison
between the best practices and the reality and investigate whether
the best practices are of distinguishable advantage over the other
options based on the experience of the interview participants.
Pair Analysis. In our analysis, we discovered contradictory re-
sponses from participants who work in the same organization but
in different roles as managers and analysts. In this paper, we ana-
lyzed matched and mismatched responses of all our analysts and
managers because the total number of our participants was not
enough to do such a pair analysis. Future research can recruit more
participants, and by having more pairs, investigate matches and
mismatches among pairs.
Industry Sector Analysis. Different SOC from various industries
can have distinct problems. In this paper, we had participants from
industry sectors, including airline, construction, education, finan-
cial services, information technology, and professional services.
Internal vs. Outsourced SOC Analysis. Different SOC types
can have distinct problems. For instance, in our analysis, compared
to an internal SOC, we observed that visibility and response speed
issues arise more in outsourced SOCs because of the nature of
provider/client agreements, a client’s limited budget, and a client’s
inability to cooperate with the provider. Future work can focus on
each type of SOCs and analyze their unique issues.
Tiered vs. Non-tiered SOC Analysis. In this study, in total, we
had 18 participants; however, only two of them were from a non-
tiered SOC. This number was not enough for us to analyze each
structure. Given that, in comparison, each SOC hierarchical struc-
ture can have superiority over each other in some aspects. Future
work can independently study each structure and analyze their
unique advantages and disadvantages.
Security Tool Analysis. In this study, we comprehensively ana-
lyzed the perspective differences of managers and analysts toward
various aspects of SOCs. Among these aspects, we asked our par-
ticipants what they think about their tools and their functionality
issues without going into detail on specific tools and toolsets. Some
of the names of the tools that our participants mentioned using
are Splunk [48] (SIEM), NitroSecurity products [24] (SIEM), Arc-
Sight [16] (SIEM), McAfee Intrusion Detection System [25] (IDS),
FireEye products [15] (Collection of security tools), and Proof-
point [38] (Email Security). Future work can conduct a deeper
qualitative and quantitative analysis of specific tools and toolsets
that organizations commonly use in their SOCs.
7 RELATED WORK
Past research studies that are related to SOCs focused on improv-
ing the efficiency of human analysts. Sundaramurthy et al. [44]
adopted an anthropological approach to study SOC environments,
and they applied ethnographic methods to close gaps between re-
searchers and participants by studying Computer Security Incident
Response Teams (CSIRTs) [46]. As a continuation, they conducted
an anthropological study at a corporate SOC for over six months
and proposed a model that explains the analyst burnout phenome-
non [43]. In their other work, they discussed analyst burnout and
reduced effectiveness as adverse effects of failure in conflict reso-
lution [47] and tool-based solutions are proposed to improve SOC
efficiency [45].
Axon et al. [2] examined the perspectives of security practi-
tioners by incorporation of non-speech audio into their working
environment by analyzing its integration and design requirements.
Onwubiko [36] proposed a framework to ensure swift incident reso-
lution and to maintain secure business operations for organizations.
The author discussed SOC operations and provided recommenda-
tions for best practices related to those operations. Zhong et al. [54]
presented a suggestion model that traces the operations of analysts
and makes recommendations of actions based on the match with
senior analysts’ performance. The goals were to avoid novice an-
alysts from being overwhelmed by the influx of incidents and to
help them with the triage of those incidents. Goodall et al. [18]
presented a visual analytics system, Situ, which they designed for
analysts to identify anomalies while watching the network for se-
curity events. Janos et al. [27] discussed some good practices such
as training for employees, friendly reporting system, and having
endpoint detection systems as countermeasures to defend against
cybercrimes.
Security incident and event management (SIEM) systems are im-
portant because they collect, normalize, and analyze incidents from
multiple sources that are handled by security analysts to protect the
organization. Therefore, with the increase of more sophisticated
and novel attacks, it is important for the SIEM tools to evolve [5].
Additionally, Miloslavskaya et al. [33] shared the concern of hav-
ing an integrated incident management system for organizations’
internal security.
Various research studies focus on the issue of log management
because logs are the first piece of information consulted when an
attack is encountered. As stored logs are used by organizations
for forensics, reviewing, and auditing future incidents, Madani et
al. [32] designed a log management functional architecture for
network event analysis. Beehive automatically mines and extracts
useful data from the overloaded collection of information [52].
Yuan [53] introduced an architecture based on correlation analysis
to reduce duplicate alarms, correlate different security events, and
suggest measures to tackle security events. In their recent work,
Hassan et al. [20] presented a tool, NoDoze, to combat information
overload problem that security analysts are experiencing in large
enterprises due to the high volume of false alarms.
There are other research studies that we consider related yet
did not focus on SOCs specifically. For example, previous work has
studied the workplace of IT security professionals [8] and inves-
tigated the workflow, decision processes, and cognitive activities
in which information assurance analysts engage [10]. Werlinger
et al. [49, 51] carried out a participatory observation to identify IT
security practitioners’ interactions, along with making recommen-
dations on improving tool support for complex security tasks. In
another study, Werlinger et al. [50] identified challenges faced by
IT security practitioners among human, organizational, and tech-
nological factors from semi-structured interviews and analyzed
using qualitative description. In a recent study, Stevens et al. [41]
presented a case study on the use of formalized threat modeling by
security professionals and the benefits it brings to the entire organi-
zation’s security posture. In other field studies, researchers observed
work practices, tools misalignment, and problem-solving strategies
of system administrators [3, 19]. Dietrich et al. [12] conducted a
qualitative study to understand the perspective of system operators
on security configurations and analyze what they perceive as the
