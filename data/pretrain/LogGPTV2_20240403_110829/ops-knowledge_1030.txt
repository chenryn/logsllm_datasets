User: Is there any easy way to handle multiple lines user input in command-line Python application?
I was looking for an answer without any result, because I don't want to:

read data from a file (I know, it's the easiest way);
create any GUI (let's stay with just a command line, OK?);
load text line by line (it should pasted at once, not typed and not pasted line by line);
work with each of lines separately (I'd like to have whole text as a string).

What I would like to achieve is to allow user pasting whole text (containing multiple lines) and capture the input as one string in entirely command-line tool. Is it possible in Python?
It would be great, if the solution worked both in Linux and Windows environments (I've heard that e.g. some solutions may cause problems due to the way cmd.exe works).
Assistant: Use :
input = raw_input("Enter text")
These gets in input as a string all the input. So if you paste a whole text, all of it will be in the input variable.
EDIT: Apparently, this works only with Python Shell on Windows.
