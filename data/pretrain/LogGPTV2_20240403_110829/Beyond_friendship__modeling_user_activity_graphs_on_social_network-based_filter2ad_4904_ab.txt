### Top Three Applications on Facebook by Monthly Active Users (MAU) in December 2009

We use iHeart to drive and evaluate the development of our User Activity Graph (UAG) growth model. Additionally, we employ UAGs from Hugged and iSmile to test the applicability of this model to other gifting applications.

**Figure 1(b)** illustrates user activity on iHeart over 13 months following its launch, highlighting three distinct periods:
1. **Ramp-up Period (until week 49, 2009)**: This phase is characterized by a steady increase in user activity.
2. **Peak Period (weeks 50-51, 2009)**: A short-lived peak in user activity.
3. **Declining Period (post-week 51, 2009)**: A gradual decline in user engagement.

The sharp fluctuations in user activity during these phases are often attributed to real-world events and holidays, such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas/New Year, and Valentine's Day. For instance, user activity typically spikes before these occasions and then decreases during the event, with some exceptions like Mother's Day (week 19, 2010).

This three-phase pattern of user activity is common across all our social applications and is primarily due to the novelty of the application and eventual user fatigue. However, this pattern is less pronounced in longer-lasting applications like Farmville [28].

### Analysis and Data Selection

To ensure our analysis is representative of all three phases of user activity and to minimize processing times, we selected specific periods of user activity for iHeart, as shown in Table 1. These periods capture variations in application lifetime phases, including stable, increasing, and declining user activity, as well as special real-world events. We also used the same 10 weeks' data from Hugged and iSmile to test our UAG growth model, but only listed week 34-2009 in Table 1 for brevity.

In our traces, a week’s user activity starts at 12:00:01 AM Pacific Time on Sunday and ends at 12:00:00 AM the following Sunday. We chose weekly periods over shorter or longer intervals due to the consistency and manageability of the data. Our analysis and simulations were performed for all listed weekly activity periods, but we present results for one representative week from each phase:
- **Pre-peak Phase**: Week 34-2009
- **Peak Phase**: Week 50-2009
- **Post-peak Phase**: Week 26-2010

### Understanding Social Application Growth

Existing friendship models generate synthetic graphs that reproduce key graph properties such as:
- **Clustering Coefficient (CC)**: The ratio of the number of edges between neighbors of a node to the total number of possible edges between those neighbors.
- **Degree Distribution**: The fraction of nodes with a given degree, distinguishing between in-degrees and out-degrees.
- **Connected Components**: The number and size of connected components in the graph.

These properties are commonly used to summarize the static structure of Online Social Network (OSN) graphs [19]. Our goal is to develop a growth model that reproduces these properties, including distinct in- and out-degree distributions, for our UAGs. Our findings show that these graph metrics stabilize around a week’s aggregate user activity for our applications (Section 4). Therefore, we simulate only weekly user activity to simplify our growth model. Our model differentiates between active users, who send at least one Action Request (AR) in a week’s UAG, and inactive users, who only receive ARs.

### Key Parameters for Growth Model

The growth processes of social applications depend on various mechanisms. We believe the following parameters are essential for modeling gifting applications:
- **Probability of Sending to New Targets (α)**: The probability that a user will target a previously unseen user through ARs.
- **Probability a User Remains Inactive (β)**: The probability that a user will remain inactive in a weekly UAG.
- **Active User Duration (dx)**: The distribution of the number of days an active user appears in a given week’s UAG, which follows a power-law distribution with exponent γd.
- **Daily ARs Sent (mx)**: The distribution of the number of ARs sent by users on a given day, which also follows a power-law distribution with exponent γm.

User activity on social applications is continuous, meaning users in one time period influence incoming users in the next. Almost 80% of AR acceptees visit the application within 48 hours of receiving the AR [16]. In weekly snapshots of user activity, a proportion of users never receive ARs in the current week but still appear in the UAG. These are the seeding users responsible for continued activity in the given week. Along with the daily AR limit (M), we use the number of seeding users (N0) as an external constraint in our model.
