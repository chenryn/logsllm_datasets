top three applications on Facebook by MAU in December
2009. We use iHeart to drive and evaluate the development
of our UAG growth model, and employ UAGs from Hugged
and iSmile to test this model’s applicability to other gift-
ing applications. Figure 1(b) shows user activity on iHeart
for 13 months after its launch, and indicates three distinct
periods of activity on iHeart: the ramp-up user activity pe-
riod (until week 49, 2009), the short-lived peak user activity
period (weeks 50-51, 2009), and the declining user activity
period. The sharp ﬂuctuations in user activity in all three
phases indicate real-world events/holidays, where user activ-
ity usually spikes before the occasion and then falls during
the event, with exceptions such as Mother’s Day (week 19,
2010). This three-phase lifetime user activity is evident on
all of our social applications, is attributed to application
novelty and eventual user fatigue, and is less prominent on
longer-lasting applications such as Farmville [28].
In order to perform analysis that is representative of all
three phases of our applications’ user activity and lower pro-
cessing times for our analysis, we use the periods of activ-

(b) The total number of hearts sent per week on iHeart
across 13 months. We see three user activity peri-
ods for iHeart: increasing activity (upto 50-2009), peak
activity (50-2009) and declining activity (01-2010 on-
wards). Sharp dips/spikes in user activity are due to
holidays and special real-world events. From left to
right, these dips are due to: Halloween, Thanksgiving,
Christmas/New Year, and Valentine’s Day.

applications, and user activity for iHeart.
ity for iHeart shown in Table 1. This sample of user ac-
tivity periods captures all variations in application lifetime
phases, stable/increasing/declining user activity and special
real-world events. We use the same 10 weeks’ data from
Hugged and iSmile to test our UAG growth model, but only
list week 34-2009 in Table 1 for brevity.
In our traces, a week’s user activity starts at 12:00:01AM
Paciﬁc Time on Sunday, and ends on the following Sunday at
12:00:00AM. We discuss the reason for selecting weekly user
activity periods over shorter and longer choices in Section 4.
We performed analysis and simulations for all listed weekly
activity periods. However, due to the similarity in results
from a given phase’s weekly periods, we only present results
for one week from each phase: we use week 34-2009 as a
representative week for the pre-peak phase, week 50-2009 for
the peak phase, and week 26-2010 for the post-peak phase.
We discuss the metrics we use to model our UAGs next.
3.3 Understanding Social Application Growth
Existing friendship models generate synthetic graphs that
reproduce the following key graph properties:
• Clustering Coeﬃcient (CC): The CC of a node v ∈ V
is the ratio of number of edges between neighbors x
of v (such that ∃(x, v) ∈ E) and the total number of

periods belong to all three phases of an application’s lifetime: pre-peak (P-), peak (P) and post-peak (P+).

edges possible between those neighbors. The CC of a
graph is the average of individual nodes’ CCs.
• Degree Distribution: The degree distribution ∀k : P (k)
of a graph is the fraction of nodes with degree k. If
there are N nodes where nk have degree k, P (k) =
nk/N. We distinguish between in- and out-degrees.
• Connected Components: Two nodes x and y belong
to one connected component if an undirected path be-
tween x and y exists. A component’s nodes are only
connected with other nodes in the same component.
We look at number of components, as well as percent-
age of users in the largest components.
Existing research uses these properties to summarize the
static structure of OSN graphs [19]. We want a growth
model that reproduces the above properties, including dis-
tinct in- and out-degree distributions, for our UAGs. Our
ﬁndings show these graph metrics stabilize around a week’s
aggregate user activity for our applications (Section 4). We
use this ﬁnding to simulate only weekly user activity to sim-
plify our growth model. Our model diﬀerentiates between
active, and inactive users. Active users send at least one
AR in a week’s UAG, and inactive users only receive, and
do not send, ARs in a week’s UAG.
The social application growth processes are dependent on
use of diﬀerent growth mechanisms. We believe the follow-
ing list of application-speciﬁc parameters must be used in a
growth model for gifting applications.
• Probability of Sending to New Targets (α): This is the
probability a user will target a previously unseen user
through ARs in our UAGs.
• Probability a User Remains Inactive (β): Inactive users
may or may not be subscribed to our applications. The
subscribed inactive users, even though they may visit
the application, do not send ARs. The parameter β
represents the probability a user will remain inactive
in a weekly UAG.
• Active User Duration (dx): Nodes in UAGs are more
transient in nature as compared to friendship graphs.
In order to capture this transience in our model, we
use the distribution of the number of days an active
user appears in a given week’s UAG as a parame-
ter. Our measurements suggest dx is power-law dis-
tributed, with exponent γd.
• Daily ARs Sent (mx): Even though our UAGs show
limits on ARs per day, users may not exhaust these
limits. Furthermore, some users may visit an appli-
cation but not send any ARs at all. This parameter
captures the distribution of number of ARs users send
on a given day, which is important for generating accu-
rate degree distributions. Our measurements suggest
mx is power-law distributed, with exponent γm.
Note that user activity on social applications is continu-
ous, i.e., users in one time period are responsible for incom-
ing users in the consecutive time period. We have previously
reported that almost 80% of all AR acceptees visit the ap-
plication within 48 hours of receiving the AR [16].
If we
consider weekly snapshots of user activity, a proportion of
users never receive ARs in the current week, yet appear in
the UAG regardless. These are the seeding users responsible
for continued activity on the application in the given week.
Along with the daily AR limit (M ), we use the number of
seeding users (N0) as an external constraint in our model.
