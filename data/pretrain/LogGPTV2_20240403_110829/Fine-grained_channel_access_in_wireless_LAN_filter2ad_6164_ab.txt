where tdata is the time used for data transmission, tpreamble is the time
used to transmit per-frame training symbols and tack is the time used
for the ACK frame.
Only tdata is used for transmitting application data, while all other
times are overheads. Some overheads are constrained by physi-
cal laws and current contraints in state-of-the-art radio electronics.
For example, you cannot reduce tprop less than 1(cid:22)s to cover a net-
work with a radius of a few hundreds of meters. It is also difﬁ-
cult to reduce tTxRx since the RF circuit requires a few microsec-
ond to settle down for sending or receiving. Others are needed
for the correct operation of the protocol. For example, we need
training symbols for reliable estimation of the wireless channel for
each frame, thus tpreamble is essential. The average backoff slots,
denoted by W , reﬂects the ability of CSMA/CA to avoid colli-
sions. Thus, to work well in normal network settings, we need
a reasonably large W . ACKs are also needed to detect collisions
and other losses, thus in general we do not want to remove tack.
Table 1 outlines some timing parameters deﬁned in 802.11. They
remain similar across the different standards of 802.11a/g/n except
for the preamble; since 802.11n uses MIMO, it requires more train-
ing symbols in its preamble.
Therefore, when the PHY data rate increases, only tdata will be
reduced proportionally, while the other parameters remain largely
unchanged. As a consequence, the efﬁciency ratio (cid:17) decreases in-

versely proportionally. Figure 2 illustrates such a phenomenon: the
efﬁciency quickly decreases from 60% at 54Mbps (802.11a/g) to
less than 10% at 1Gbps (future 802.11ac/ad).
As mentioned in Section 1, transmitting larger frames will im-
prove the efﬁciency ratio, but such a frame-aggregation approach
has practical limitations. Fine-grained channel access will be a
better approach, if we can divide the whole channel into smaller
sub-channels efﬁciently and allow different nodes to access dif-
ferent sub-channels simultaneously. Enabling concurrent transmis-
sion across sub-channels is in effect an aggregation and opportunity
to amortize the MAC overhead across different nodes.
2.2 An OFDM Primer
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has be-
come increasingly popular in modern wireless communications [17].
It has been embraced by many existing wireless standards like IEEE
802.11a/g/n, WiMax [2], and by future standards like 3GPP LTE [3].
Cognitive radio technologies also mainly rely on OFDM to use
non-contiguous spectrum bands for communication [19].
OFDM divides a spectrum band into many small and partially
overlapping signal-carrying frequency bands called subcarriers. The
subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that they are “orthogonal” to
one another, meaning that cross-talk between subcarriers sums up
to zero even though they are overlapping (Figure 3). OFDM can
therefore pack subcarriers tightly together without inter-carrier in-
terference, eliminating the need to have guard bands.

2 ::( N
OFDM can be efﬁciently implemented using (inverse) Fast Fourier
Transform (iFFT/FFT). In an OFDM system with FFT size N,
each subcarrier has exactly the same width of B
N and the subcar-
rier central points are located at frequencies of fc + 2(cid:25)nB
N ; n =
(cid:0) 1), where fc is the central frequency of the channel
(cid:0) N
and B is the channel width. Different modulations (e.g., BPSK,
QPSK, etc.) can be applied to each subcarrier independently. After
modulating information onto each subcarrier, the sender performs
an iFFT to convert the frequency domain presentation to N time-
domain samples which can be sent over the air. The time needed to
transmit these N samples is usually called the FFT period, which
B seconds. Thus, given a ﬁxed channel width, a larger
is equal to N
N means a longer FFT period. Then, at the receiver side, the sig-
nal can be converted back to the frequency domain using the FFT,
where each subcarrier can be demodulated independently.

(b) Retaining orthogonality with a proper size CP
Figure 4: Misaligned OFDM transmissions.
When OFDM is used as a multi-access technology where multi-
ple stations share the same channel, symbol timing alignment will
be a critical issue. As shown in Figure 4(a), if OFDM symbols from
two nodes misalign, the receiver may not be able to pick up an FFT
window containing the same samples across all senders. Orthog-
onality will be lost and signals from both nodes will cause mutual
interference. To ensure perfect symbol alignment, a multi-access
technology called OFDMA has been proposed for OFDM cellu-
lar networks like WiMAX and LTE. OFDMA requires all mobile
stations to maintain tight timing synchronization with the cellular
base station (usually hundreds of nanoseconds). It requires a com-
plex ranging scheme to measure the propagation delay and ﬁne tune
each mobile station’s timing offset at the sample level granularity.
OFDM further has a built-in robustness mechanism called the
cyclic-preﬁx (CP) [26] to guard against symbol misalignment due
to multipath echoes. Each OFDM symbol is preﬁxed with a copy
of the symbol’s tailing samples so that the receiver can still ﬁnd a
proper FFT window as long as the misalignment is within a CP
length (Figure 4(b)). CP is intrinsic to any OFDM system; in
802.11, the CP-to-symbol length ratio is 1:4 (0:8(cid:22)s to 3:2(cid:22)s).
2.3 Fine-grained Channel Access in WLAN
We propose to use ﬁne-grained channel access to improve through-
put efﬁciency in a high-data-rate WLAN. We divide the channel
width into appropriately sized sub-channels commensurate with
the PHY data rate and typical frame size, and further use OFDM
on the whole channel to avoid wasting bandwidth on guard bands.
The fundamental challenge with this approach is coordinating ran-
dom access among multiple distributed and asynchronous nodes
in a WLAN (potentially with multiple APs), without resorting to
cellular-style tight timing synchronization.
Because coordination in a WLAN is distributed and decentral-
ized in nature, it is impractical to have OFDMA-style global time
synchronization. Not only would it introduce a great deal of sys-
tem complexity, it would also likely require new hardware func-
tionality beyond the current or emerging 802.11 standards. Further,
OFDMA does not support random access and hence cannot be used
directly in a WLAN.
Instead, we should use existing 802.11 coordination mechanisms,
such as carrier-sensing and broadcast, to establish a rough symbol
alignment among concurrent senders. We can leverage OFDM’s
intrinsic CP mechanism and lengthen it to suit the alignment scale,
and further use a longer symbol length to maintain the same CP-
to-symbol ratio. This approach calls for a new OFDM architecture
specially designed for distributed coordination.
Having a longer symbol length, however, does have a negative
impact that makes a conventional time-domain backoff scheme very
inefﬁcient. For example, if we can only guarantee a 10(cid:22)s sym-

bol alignment under current 802.11 coordination schemes, we will
need a 40(cid:22)s symbol length to keep the same guard-time overhead
ratio. The reserved time slot for backoff, which has to be at least
one OFDM symbol in length, will now increase proportionally.
This raises another technical challenge: we need a new efﬁcient
MAC contention mechanism and a new backoff scheme. All these
are necessary conditions for ﬁne-grained channel access in high-
data-rate WLANs.
3. FICA DESIGN
FICA is a cross-layer design that enables ﬁne-grained channel
access in high-rate wide-band WLANs. It is based on OFDM and
divides a wide-band channel into a set of orthogonal subchannels,
which different nodes can contend for individually. For the sake of
clarity, we ﬁrst assume a scenario consisting of a single access point
and multiple mobile stations. We show later it is straightforward to
extend FICA to the multi-AP case. Also, while in the following
discussion we primarily use a 20-MHz channel as an example to
explain the operation of FICA, we note that FICA is a scalable
design that works for arbitrarily wide channel bands.
Figure 5 illustrates the basic uplink media access scheme for
FICA. In this example, the channel is divided into just four sub-
channels and each subchannel contains a number of subcarriers.
FICA follows the basic scheme of CSMA. A new transmission op-
portunity appears only when the whole channel is idle. Then, all
stations try to contend for different subchannels after the channel
is idle for a certain amount of time (DIFS). At this time, all nodes
will transmit a special RTS signal simultaneously. This RTS signal
is a specially-designed OFDM symbol, called Multi-tone RTS (see
Section 3.3), in which each node embeds its contention information
in a set of subcarriers for each subchannel it intends to access. All
M-RTS signals are resolved at the AP, and the AP will broadcast
the contention results in a corresponding M-CTS OFDM signaling
symbol. Then, only the nodes assigned subchannels will use them
for data transmissions; note that a node may contend for multiple
subchannels based on its instantaneous trafﬁc demands. The AP
will then generate an acknowledgement on each subchannel where
a data frame has been successfully decoded.
Downlink transmissions follow similar steps, but the AP will ini-
tiate an M-RTS signal and receiving stations may return an M-CTS.
However, since FICA does not use random time backoff, it needs to
separate uplink and downlink transmissions; otherwise, collisions
would happen under bi-directional trafﬁc. FICA does so by assign-
ing different DIFS times to uplink and downlink transmissions, de-
scribed further in Section 3.4.
We now present an analysis of the symbol timing misalignment
problem in a CSMA-based WLAN. Based on this analysis, in Sec-
tion 3.2 we describe the FICA PHY structure. We then describe
how FICA achieves frequency domain contention and backoff in
Section 3.3. We ﬁnish by discussing several related design issues
in Section 3.5.

In a WLAN, transmissions from distributed nodes are coordi-
nated based on carrier-sensing and overhearing broadcast frames
(e.g., RTS/CTS). Unlike conventional MACs that use these mech-
anisms to avoid simultaneous transmissions, FICA exploits simul-
taneous transmissions to enable concurrent access from different
nodes but in orthogonal subchannels.
In FICA, carrier-sensing coordinates the transmissions of M-
RTS. After they sense an idle channel for a ﬁxed DIFS time, two
nodes A and B may transmit their M-RTS symbols simultaneously.
However, since there is always a delay to sense the channel and for
a signal to propagate from one node to another, these two M-RTS
symbols cannot be transmitted and received at exactly the same
time. Figure 6(a) shows the worst case analysis of the symbol tim-
ing difference of two such M-RTS symbols received by the AP.
Assume A senses the channel idle for tdifs seconds, and A trans-
mits M-RTS ﬁrst. It will take at most tprop for the signal to arrive at
node B. However, it may take B at least tcca time to reliably sense
the busy channel. If the signal arrives at node B after B starts a
sensing slot, B may not be able to assess a busy channel.1 Thus,
after the sensing slot, B still declares an idle channel and sends its
M-RTS as well. The radio signal of B’s M-RTS is actually emitted
after tRxTx. And it will take at most another tprop for the M-RTS
to arrive at the AP. The total misaligned time is characterized by
Eq. 5. The bound is tight in the worst case.
terr_rts (cid:20) tcca + tRxTx + 2 (cid:2) tprop:
(5)
If we use the values of the parameters listed in Table 1, we ﬁnd that
terr_rts can be as large as 11(cid:22)s.
If coordination is performed by overhearing a broadcast frame,
e.g., M-CTS or DATA, the timing misalignment can be shorter be-
cause the two senders are synchronized better by a reference broad-
cast [6]. Figure 6(b) shows the worst case of symbol timing mis-
alignment of data frames after receiving a M-CTS broadcast. As-
suming the jitter for a local timer can be neglected since the waiting
time is usually very small (a few microseconds), the timing mis-
alignment is bounded by twice the propagation time, as shown in
Eq. 6.

Using the parameter values in Table 1, terr is about 2(cid:22)s in a WLAN.
3.2 PHY Architecture
Based on the analysis in last subsection, FICA needs to provide a
guard time sufﬁciently long to handle the symbol timing misalign-
ment in a WLAN based on carrier-sensing (11(cid:22)s) and broadcast-
ing (2(cid:22)s). We further need to include an additional 800ns guard
time to account for the typical spreading delay in indoor environ-
ments [1]. We design two guard time sizes tailored to each coor-
dination situation: a long cyclic preﬁx (CP) of 11:8(cid:22)s and a short
CP of 2:8(cid:22)s. The long CP is attached to M-RTS only, while a short
CP is attached to every M-CTS, DATA, and ACK OFDM symbols,
and therefore is the major overhead of concern.
To amortize the short CP overhead, we need a longer OFDM
symbol for data. Recall from Section 2.2 that a longer OFDM
symbol is achieved by applying a larger FFT size N. Although
in theory one can choose any large FFT size N, there are a few
practical considerations. First, a large N requires more computa-
tional power to calculate the transform since the complexity of FFT
is O(N log(N )). Second, with large N the adjacent subcarriers are
1This case depends on the way the node implements carrier sensing
and threshold setting. Here we consider only the worst case.

(b) Using a reference broadcast

spaced very closely. Therefore, it is more sensitive to the frequency
offsets of different nodes. Since multiple nodes may always have
some small frequency offset (a few hundred Hz as we show later),
the adjacent subcarriers should have enough separation to accom-
modate such an offset. In practice, subcarriers are usually separated
by at least 15KHz [2, 3].
In FICA, we choose the FFT size of the DATA OFDM symbol to
be 256 points in a 20MHz channel (subcarrier width is 78:12KHz).
Its FFT period is 12:8(cid:22)s, yielding a cyclic-preﬁx overhead of 18%
which is comparable to the CP overhead of 802.11 (20%). ACK
symbols have the same structure as DATA symbols. Since the M-
RTS uses the long CP, it should contain as few symbols as possi-
ble. Thus, we choose a larger FFT size (512 points) for M-RTS to
embed all necessary control information, which otherwise would
require multiple OFDM symbols for a smaller FFT size. FICA ap-
plies the same FFT size to the M-CTS for format consistency. Ta-
ble 2 summarizes the detailed time parameters of the OFDM sym-
bol structure in FICA.
