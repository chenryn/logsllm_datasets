**ATT&CK ID:** T1599.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Address Translation Traversal

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by manipulating the Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration of a network device. By making malicious modifications to NAT settings, adversaries can potentially bypass traffic routing restrictions that are designed to separate trusted and untrusted networks. This technique allows them to establish connections that would otherwise be blocked, effectively enabling communication across network segments that should be isolated.
