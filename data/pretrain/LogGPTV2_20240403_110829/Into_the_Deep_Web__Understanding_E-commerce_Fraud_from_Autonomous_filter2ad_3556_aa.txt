Abstract—E-commerce miscreants heavily rely on instant
messaging (IM) to promote their illicit businesses and coordi-
nate their operations. The threat intelligence provided by IM
communication, therefore, becomes invaluable for understanding
and mitigating the threats of e-commerce frauds. However, such
information is hard to obtain since it is usually shared only
through one-on-one conversations with the criminals. In this
paper, we present the ﬁrst chatbot, called Aubrey, to actively col-
lect such intelligence through autonomous chats with real-world
e-commerce miscreants. Our approach leverages the question-
driven conversation pattern of small-time workers, who seek jobs
and/or attack resources from e-commerce fraudsters, to model the
interaction process as a ﬁnite state machine, thereby enabling
an autonomous conversation. Aubrey successfully chatted with
470 real-world e-commerce miscreants and gathered a large
amount of fraud-related artifacts, including previously-unknown
SIM gateways, account trading websites, and attack toolkits,
etc. Further, the conversations revealed the supply chain of e-
commerce fraudulent activities on the deep web and the compli-
cated relations (e.g., complicity and reselling) among miscreants.

INTRODUCTION
Every day, hundreds of thousands of individuals sit in
front of computers and repeatedly purchase the same products
(without paying) or write fake reviews (without purchasing)
using different fake accounts, based upon the tasks they
receive from the underground market, for purposes such as
sale volume inﬂation, product ranking manipulation [1], [19]
etc. Such e-commerce fraud activities are usually committed
through underground crowdsourcing [49] where miscreants
heavily rely on instant messaging (IM) to communicate with
others and coordinate their activities [20]. Through IM-based
social networks such as Telegram [17], QQ [27] etc., e-
commerce miscreants advertise their attack toolkits and ser-
vices using group chat, seek further collaborations and share
purchase links via one-on-one interaction. As an example, to
inﬂate one’s product sales volume, the merchant could order
a scalping service [49] in which the service provider hires
scalpers (i.e., small-time workers) organized through IM apps
for fake massive purchases of the product. The communication
traces for such underground operations are invaluable threat
intelligence for understanding e-commerce fraud. However,
access to the intelligence is challenging, often requiring direct
interactions with miscreants.

Challenges. IM communications carry important intelligence
about e-commerce cybercrime,
including its infrastructures
(e.g., hosting services on the deep web) and resources (e.g.,
SIM card). To collect such intelligence, security analysts today
typically inﬁltrate IM groups to passively receive multicast
messages. These messages, however, are often less valuable
due to precautions taken by the miscreants. For example (see
Section V),
in our study, 323K fraud phone numbers are
unearthed from the discovered SIM gateways (Section II),
while only 7K phone numbers have shown up in the multicast
IM group discussions. Such useful intelligence is actually only
shared through one-on-one conversation with the miscreants,
which requires human involvement. Also noteworthy is that
the number of newly appeared e-commerce miscreants con-
tinuously grow with an increasing rate of 292 percent (see
Section IV-B). One-on-one conversations by a human are
difﬁcult to manage from a cost-effectiveness standpoint.
A natural solution is to automate the conversation with
the miscreants using a chatting robot (chatbot). Although such
techniques have been studied for decades [36], [37], [50],
[51], and several commercial chatbots are available [24], [26],
they cannot be directly applied to collect threat intelligence
from cybercriminals. Having a convincing conversation with
online miscreants requires the understanding of crime-speciﬁc
dialogues. More complicated is how to strategically lead the
subjects to discuss various underground activities such as fake
account purchase. Prior research shows that the chatbot de-
signed for a speciﬁc domain or open conversation hardly works
well in other domains [34]. So far, we are not aware of any
autonomous conversation technique have been implemented
for cybercriminals. This can only be done with a conversation
strategy generation model for a speciﬁc criminal role and a
targeted dialog manager guiding the chatbot through the con-
versation to effectively gather the targeted threat intelligence.
These techniques have never been studied before.
Aubrey: autonomous chat with miscreants. In our research,
we designed and implemented the ﬁrst chatbot, called Aubrey
(AUtonomous chatBot foR intelligencE discoverY), for active
threat intelligence gathering from e-commerce fraudsters(see
Section II). Given the challenges in information collection
from these cunning players, we leveraged a unique observa-
tion about the conversation patterns with them. Small-time
workers need to seek resources (e.g., SIM cards) or jobs
(e.g., order scalping) from underground IM groups, and their
chats with fraudsters (e.g., resource sellers or job providers)
are primarily question-driven and characterized by unique
patterns:
type of fraud
accounts or tasks for order scalping) and expects an answer
for resources (e.g., phone veriﬁed account) or jobs (e.g.,
the worker asks a question (e.g.,
products for scalping); this interaction round once completed,
is followed by a predictable next round (e.g., how to buy the
accounts). These unique conversation patterns make it possible
to model the whole interaction with a given miscreant role as
a ﬁnite state machine (FSM), thereby enabling an autonomous
conversation. Such an FSM is run by a dialogue manager to
guide the conversation with related miscreants to gather threat
intelligence from the subjects.
More speciﬁcally, Aubrey utilizes as seeds traces of human-
generated dialogues recorded from security analysts’ conver-
sations (in Chinese) with different e-commerce miscreants. It
then expands the seed set with the corpora from underground
e-commerce IM groups and forums to build an underground
knowledge base (Section III-C). For example, for the seed
question, “What types of accounts are you selling”, we use
embedding techniques (Section II) to ﬁnd similar interrogative
sentences from the corpora such as “What types of accounts
do you have?” Similar questions form individual states in the
FSM conversation model and their relations are used for state
transitions. This process can be partially automated: using NLP
techniques, our approach automatically segments the traces
into a sequence of interaction rounds for different types of
intelligence. These rounds and their relations are checked
manually then converted into the FSMs. Occasionally,
the
subjects’ responses could contain questions unrelated to any
targeted intelligence, e.g., “How many accounts do you need?”
To handle such questions, Aubrey resorts to a retrieval model
that looks for similar questions from the corpora and response
with the most relevant answer (Section III-D).
Measurement and discoveries. We ran Aubrey to chat with
miscreants identiﬁed from 150 underground IM groups we
inﬁltrated. So far, she has interacted with 470 subjects, in-
cluding 315 resource sellers (called upstream, 185 selling SIM
cards and 130 selling accounts), and 155 fraud order opera-
tors (called downstream, see Section II). These conversations
produced about 7,250 communication messages, exposing
substantial intelligence with 40 SIM gateways for retrieving
phone numbers (from which we collected 323K, which is 800
times larger than that gathered from public SIM gateways
[44]), links for 38 underground markets that sell accounts, and
65 afﬁliate networks that promote fraud tasks, etc. We also
gained previously unknown threat artifacts and unprecedented
insights into the ecosystem of e-commerce frauds, and their
operations on the deep web. More speciﬁcally, we uncovered
35 hosting platforms (e.g., onini.cn and ikpay.cn) for running
fraud account storefronts. Such platforms provide a stealthy
and easy-to-deploy mechanism to serve illicit websites. Also
interesting are our ﬁndings from the software distributed by the
upstream, which include the private APIs of Company A’s1,
a leading Chinese online retailer, for automatically placing
orders and collecting coupons on its platforms. We reported
these attack surfaces to Company A and received acknowl-
edgment from the company. Most importantly, we showed that
the threat intelligence gleaned from individual conversations is
much more valuable than that recovered from multicast group
communication: e.g., the criminal artifacts (SIM gateways,
automated attack tools, etc.) obtained from our conversations
are much more than what we could get from the inﬁltrated
chat groups (see Section VI for more details).

Further, the intelligence collected also enriched our knowl-
edge about the e-commerce fraud ecosystem, in terms of a
better understanding of the complicated relationships between
upstream and downstream miscreants. Particularly, we detected
that miscreants may play multiple roles: SIM farmers some-
times also act as account merchants using a large number
of SIM cards to circumvent phone veriﬁcation for registering
bulks of accounts on an e-commerce platform. Also interest-
ingly, the downstream job providers sometimes refer us to
some upstream providers to purchase resources during the
conversation. When estimating the revenue of the upstream
and downstream miscreants, we see the average revenue per
month for a SIM farmer is at least $8.9K, while it is $48.2K
for an account merchant and $16.7K for a fraud order operator.
Contribution. The contributions of the paper are as follows:
• We designed and implemented Aubrey, the ﬁrst autonomous
conversation system for active threat intelligence gathering
from e-commerce miscreants. Our evaluation shows Aubrey
can automatically and effectively extract target intelligence
from real-world miscreants. To further contribute to the com-
munity, we release the implementation of Aubrey at [2].
• Chatting with 470 real-world miscreants, Aubrey helps us
gain new insights into the e-commerce fraud ecosystem and
exposes a great amount of fraud-related artifacts, including
valuable assets (e.g., previously-unknown automated tools that
exploit Company A’s private APIs) for a successful attack.
Such understanding and artifacts can be used to better mitigate
e-commerce fraudulent activities.
II. BACKGROUND
A. E-commerce Threat
Monetization in organized e-commerce frauds today hap-
pens in different underground markets. Such markets ﬁt into
two categories: the upstream markets that provide attack assets
(e.g., fraud accounts), and the downstream markets that supply
illicit afﬁliate networks (e.g., order scalping platforms). In our
study, our chatbot acts as a small-time worker to seek resources
from upstream markets and jobs from downstream markets,
as shown in Figure 1. Below we elaborate on three major
underground markets involved in Chinese e-commerce frauds.
SIM farms. E-commerce platforms (e.g., Alibaba, Amazon)
usually employ phone veriﬁcation for account registration
protection. The veriﬁcation asks the client to link a phone
number to her account. The server then sends a veriﬁcation
PIN to the number via SMS and the client needs to enter the
PIN into an online form to complete the registration.
To circumvent
the veriﬁcation process, attackers build
SIM farms (a gateway or software) for bulk account reg-
istration [16]. Here, a SIM gateway is a web service for
the client to get phone numbers, and the gateway software
provides the same functionalities but operates as a standalone
application (mostly on PC). In this illicit business, the SIM
farmer provides temporary phone numbers to his clients for
account registration. More speciﬁcally, when a SIM farm client
wants to sign up an account for illicit usage [18], she pays
the SIM farm to get a number. The gateway monitors all
incoming SMS to the number using a modem pool [11] and
then forwards them to the client once received.

the tasks purchase the target products using fake accounts.
Once the platform is informed by the merchant that the tasks
are completed, the afﬁliates receive commissions. Throughout
this process, additional services are also in place to tackle the
protection deployed by e-commerce platforms: for example, e-
commerce platforms require the merchant to provide shipping
number to prove the purchase takes place; such tracking IDs
can be purchased from other underground services. Similarly,
the bonus hunter can also take advantage of a platform service,
which employs workers to purchase target products (e.g., to
bypass purchase limitation per account) and then send the
products to the hunter: the bonus hunters would provide the
workers links to the proﬁtable products, shipping addresses and
the forms for reporting complete transactions. By delivering
the products to the given addresses, the workers receive get
commissions from the bonus hunters.
Scope of our study. The current design and implementation
of Aubrey is tuned toward understanding the big picture of
the three most prominent e-commerce fraudulent activities
[4]: SIM farming, fraud accounts trading, and order racket
(including order scalping and bonus hunting) mainly target-
ing e-commerce platforms in China, the largest e-commerce
market in the world [5]. These activities inﬂuence markets
worth billions of dollars and involve a majority of e-commerce
miscreants. In the meantime, we will not cover other small
portions of e-commerce miscreants, such as upstream providers
like automated tool providers and CAPTCHA solvers and
downstream workers like fake reviewers and click farmers.
B. Natural language processing
In our study, we utilized a set of NLP technologies, as
summarized in the following.
Automatic human-computer conversation. The automatic
human-computer conversation has long been considered one
of the most challenging artiﬁcial intelligence problems. During
the past decades, researchers have developed various systems
based on human-crafted rules [43], information retrieval [36],
[37], and deep learning techniques [41], [50], [51]. Typically, a
chatbot ﬁrst analyzes human inputs and then identiﬁes related
sentences from a database or synthesizes responses to them. In
general, two types of systems are developed: vertical-domain
chatbots (such as TRAINS-95 for transportation domain, and
MIMIC [32] for movie show-time) and open-domain chatbots
(such as Xiaoice [24] and Rinna [26]). A vertical-domain
chatbot processes domain-speciﬁc dialogues to perform do-
main tasks while an open-domain chatbot works on general
conversation topics. To the best of our knowledge, the technical
detail of an e-commerce threat intelligence gathering chatbot
has not been publicly reported.
Word/sentence embedding. Word embedding W : words →
V n is a parameterized function that maps each word to a high-
dimensional vector (200∼500 dimensions), e.g., W (‘fraud’) =
(0.2,−0.4, 0.7,··· ),
the word’s relations with
other words. Such a mapping can be done in different ways,
e.g., using the continuous bag-of-words model and the skip-
gram technique to analyze the words’ context. Such a vector
representation is designed to ensure that synonyms are rep-
resented by similar vectors and antonyms are mapped to dis-
similar vectors. Motivated by word embedding is the sentence
embedding technique which is for representing the semantic
to represent

SIM cards in China need to be registered with the owner’s
identity (national ID number). To bypass this safeguard, SIM
farmers usually purchase a large amount of stolen personal
information from underground markets and impersonate the
victims in front of carriers. They also exploit some carriers’
policy loopholes to avoid ID veriﬁcation. For example, carriers
always support enterprise registration without individual ID
veriﬁcation. SIM farmers could open their own companies and
request bulk registration through this channel.
Fraud accounts trading. Fraud accounts serve as stepping
stones to many proﬁtable racket businesses [46], [47]. Rackets
such as order scalping and cash-out on e-commerce platforms
require some credentials, especially user accounts, to purchase
products or collect coupons. However,
in addition to the
aforementioned phone veriﬁcation, the bulk account registra-
tion needs to get through further registration barriers such as
CAPTCHA, email conﬁrmation, etc. Serving this purpose is
an underground industry that cracks all such barriers through
various technical (e.g., image processing for CAPTCHA solv-
ing) and nontechnical (e.g., crowd-sourcing) means to register
accounts, and a black market that sells such accounts in bulk.
On the fraud account market, account merchants offer e-
commerce platforms’ credentials at prices ranging from $0.10
to $4.50 per account (see Section VII), depending on the
quality and privilege level. A buyer can purchase the creden-
tials through web storefronts owned by the merchants or from
hosting platforms. Here, the market hosting platform provides
site templates for account merchants to quickly deploy the
fraud account market sites and host the websites on behalf of
