Verifying That the Analyzer Has Been Correctly Created
Purpose
Verify that the analyzer has been created on the switch with the appropriate input interfaces and
appropriate output interface.
Action
You can verify that the port mirror analyzer has been configured as expected using the show forwarding-
options port-mirroring command.
user@switch> show forwarding-options port-mirroring
Instance Name: &global_instance
Instance Id: 1
Input parameters:

Output parameters:
Family State Destination Next-hop

Meaning
This output shows that the port-mirroring instance has a ratio of 1 (mirroring every packet, the default
setting) and the maximum size of the original packet that was mirrored (0 indicates the entire packet). If
the state of the output interface is down or if the output interface is not configured, the value of state
will be down and the instance will not be programmed for mirroring.
Layer 2 Port Mirroring of PE Router or PE Switch Logical Interfaces
For a router or switch configured as a provider edge (PE) device on the customer-facing edge of a
service provider network, you can apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter at the following ingress
and egress points to mirror the traffic between the router or switch and customer edge (CE) devices,
which are typically also routers and Ethernet switches.
Table 123 on page 1164 describes the ways in which you can apply Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters
to a router or switch configured as a PE device.

Layer 2 Port Mirroring of PE Router or PE Switch Aggregated Ethernet Interfaces
An aggregated Ethernet interface is a virtual aggregated link that consists of a set of physical interfaces
of the same speed and operating in full-duplex link connection mode. You can configure aggregated
Ethernet interfaces between CE devices and PE devices for VPLS routing instances. Traffic is load-
balanced across all of the links in the aggregated interface. If one or more links in the aggregated
interface fails, the traffic is switched to the remaining links.
You can apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to an aggregated Ethernet interface to configure
port mirroring at the parent interface. However, if any child interfaces are bound to different Layer 2
port-mirroring instances, packets received at the child interfaces will be mirrored to the destinations
specified by their respective port-mirroring instances. Thus, multiple child interfaces can mirror packets
to multiple destinations.
For example, suppose the parent aggregated Ethernet interface instance ae0 has two child interfaces:
• xe-2/0/0
• xe-3/1/2
Suppose that these child interfaces on ae0 are bound to two different Layer 2 port-mirroring instances:
• pm_instance_A—A named instance of Layer 2 port-mirroring, bound to child interface xe-2/0/0.
• pm_instance_B—A named instance of Layer 2 port-mirroring, bound to child interface xe-3/1/2.
Now suppose you apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the Layer 2 traffic sent on ae0.0 (logical
unit 0 on the aggregated Ethernet interface instance 0). This enables port mirroring on ae0.0, which has
the following effect on the processing of traffic received on the child interfaces for which Layer 2 port-
mirroring properties are specified:
• The packets received on xe-2/0/0 are mirrored to the output interfaces configured in port-mirroring
instance pm_instance_A.
• The packets received on xe-3/1/2.0 are mirrored to the output interfaces configured in port-mirroring
instance pm_instance_B.
Because pm_instance_A and pm_instance_B can specify different packet-selection properties or mirror
destination properties, the packets received on xe-2/0/0 and xe-3/1/2.0 can mirror different packets to
different destinations.
Applying Layer 2 Port Mirroring to a Logical Interface
You can apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the input or to the output of a logical interface,
including an aggregated Ethernet logical interface. Only packets of the address-type family specified by
the filter action are mirrored.
Before you begin, complete the following task:
1167
• Define a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to be applied to the input to a logical interface or
output to a logical interface. For details, see Defining a Layer 2 Port-Mirroring Firewall Filter.
NOTE: This configuration task shows two Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters: one filter
applied to the logical interface ingress traffic, and one filter applied to the logical interface
egress traffic.
To apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to an input or output logical interface:
1. Configure the underlying physical interface for the logical interface.
a. Enable configuration of the underlying physical interface:
[edit]
user@host# edit interfaces interface-name
NOTE: A port-mirroring firewall filter can also be applied to an aggregated-Ethernet logical
interface.
b. For Gigabit Ethernet interfaces and aggregated Ethernet interfaces configured for VPLS, enable
the reception and transmission of 802.1Q VLAN-tagged frames on the interface:
[edit interfaces interface-name]
user@host# set vlan-tagging
c. For Ethernet interfaces that have IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging and bridging enabled and that must
accept packets carrying TPID 0x8100 or a user-defined TPID, set the logical link-layer
encapsulation type:
[edit interfaces interface-name]
user@host# set encapsulation extended-vlan-ethernet-switching
2. Configure the logical interface to which you want to apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter.
a.
1168
Specify the logical unit number:
[edit interfaces interface-name]
user@host# edit unit logical-unit-number
b. For a Gigabit Ethernet or Aggregated Ethernet interface, bind an 802.1Q VLAN tag ID to the
logical interface:
[edit interfaces interface-name unit logical-unit-number]
user@host# set vlan-id number
3. Enable specification of an input or output filter to be applied to Layer 2 packets that are part of
bridging domain, Layer 2 switching cross-connects, or virtual private LAN service (VPLS).
• If the filter is to be evaluated when packets are received on the interface:
[edit interfaces interface-name unit logical-unit-number]
user@host# set family family filter input pm-filter-name-a
• If the filter is to be evaluated when packets are sent on the interface:
[edit interfaces interface-name unit logical-unit-number]
user@host# set family family filter output pm-filter-name-b
The value of the family option can be ethernet-switching, ccc, or vpls.
NOTE: If port-mirroring firewall filters are applied at both the input and output of a logical
interface, two copies of each packet are mirrored. To prevent the router or switch from
forwarding duplicate packets to the same destination, include the optional mirror-once
statement at the [edit forwarding-options] hierarchy level.
4. Verify the minimum configuration for applying a named Layer 2 port mirroring firewall filter to a
logical interface:
[edit interfaces interface-name unit logical-unit-number family family filter ... ]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show interfaces
1169
interfaces {
interface-name {
vlan-tagging;
encapsulation extended-vlan-ethernet-switching;
unit number { # Apply a filter to the input of this interface
vlan-id number;
family (ethernet-switching | ccc | vpls) {
filter {
input pm-filter-for-logical-interface-input;
}
}
}
unit number { # Apply a filter to the output of this interface
vlan-id number;
family (ethernet-switching | ccc | vpls) {
filter {
output pm-filter-for-logical-interface-output;
}
}
}
}
}
Applying Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Traffic Forwarded or Flooded to a Bridge Domain
You can apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to traffic being forwarded or flooded to a bridge
domain. Only packets of the specified family type and forwarded or flooded to that bridge domain are
mirrored.
Before you begin, complete the following task:
• Define a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to be applied to the traffic being forwarded to a bridge
domain or flooded to a bridge domain. For details, see Defining a Layer 2 Port-Mirroring Firewall
Filter.
NOTE: This configuration task shows two Layer_2 port-mirroring firewall filters: one filter
applied to the bridge domain forwarding table ingress traffic, and one filter applied to the
bridge domain flood table ingress traffic.
To apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the forwarding table or flood table of a bridge domain:
1170
1. Enable configuration of the bridge domain bridge-domain-name to which you want to apply a Layer 2
port-mirroring firewall filter for forwarded or flooded traffic:
• For a bridge domain:
[edit]
user@host# edit bridge-domains bridge-domain-name
• For a bridge domain under a routing instance:
[edit]
user@host# edit routing-instances routing-instance-name bridge-domains bridge-domain-name
user@host# set instance-type virtual-switch
For more detailed configuration information, see Configuring a VPLS Routing Instance.
2. Configure the bridge domain:
[edit]
user@host# set domain-type bridge
user@host# set interface interface-name
user@host# set routing-interface routing-interface-name
For detailed configuration information, see Configuring a Bridge Domain and Configuring VLAN
Identifiers for Bridge Domains and VPLS Routing Instances.
3. Enable configuration of traffic forwarding on the bridge domain:
[edit ... bridge-domains bridge-domain-name]
user@host# edit forwarding-options
4. Apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the bridge domain forwarding table or flood table.
• To mirror packets being forwarded to the bridge domain:
[edit ... bridge-domains bridge-domain-name forwarding-options]
user@host# set filter input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-forwarded
1171
• To mirror packets being flooded to the bridge domain:
[edit ... bridge-domains bridge-domain-name forwarding-options]
user@host# set flood input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-flooded
5. Verify the minimum configuration for applying a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the
forwarding table or flood table of the bridge domain.
a. Navigate to the hierarchy level at which the bridge domain is configured:
• [edit]
• [edit routing-instances routing-instance-name]
b. Display the bridge domain configurations:
user@host# show bridge domains
bridge-domains {
bridge-domain-name {
instance-type virtual-switch; # For a bridge domain under a routing instance.
domain-type bridge;
interface interface-name;
forwarding-options {
filter { # Mirror ingress forwarded traffic
input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-forwarded;
}
flood { # Mirror ingress flooded traffic
input pm-filter-for-bd-ingress-flooded;
}
}
}
}
Applying Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Traffic Forwarded or Flooded to a VPLS Routing
Instance
You can apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to traffic being forwarded or flooded to a VPLS
routing instance. Only packets of the specified family type and forwarded or flooded to that VPLS
routing instance are mirrored.
Before you begin, complete the following task:
1172
• Define a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to be applied to the traffic being forwarded to a VPLS
routing instance or flooded to a VLAN. For details, see Defining a Layer 2 Port-Mirroring Firewall
Filter.
NOTE: This configuration task shows two Layer_2 port-mirroring firewall filters: one filter
applied to the VPLS routing instance forwarding table ingress traffic, and one filter applied to
the VPLS routing instance flood table ingress traffic.
To apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the forwarding table or flood table of a VPLS routing
instance:
1. Enable configuration of the VPLS routing instance to which you want to apply a Layer 2 port-
mirroring firewall filter for forwarded or flooded traffic:
[edit]
user@host# edit routing-instances routing-instance-name
user@host# set instance-type vpls
user@host# set interface interface-name
user@host# set route-distinguisher (as-number:number | ip-address:number)
user@host# set vrf-import [policy-names]
user@host# set vrf-export [policy-names]
user@host# edit protocols vpls
user@host@ ... vpls-configuration ...
For more detailed configuration information, see Configuring a VPLS Routing Instance.
2. Enable configuration of traffic forwarding on the VPLS routing instance:
[edit routing-instances routing-instance-name protocols vpls]
user@host# up 2
[edit routing-instances routing-instance-name]
user@host# edit forwarding-options
3. Apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the VPLS routing instance forwarding table or flood
table.
• To mirror packets being forwarded to the VPLS routing instance:
[edit routing-instances routing-instance-name forwarding-options]
user@host# set filter input pm-filter-for-vpls-ri-forwarded
1173
• To mirror packets being flooded to the VPLS routing instance:
[edit routing-instances routing-instance-name forwarding-options]
user@host# set flood input pm-filter-for-vpls-ri-flooded
4. Verify the minimum configuration for applying a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the
forwarding table or flood table of the VPLS routing instance:
[edit routing-instances routing-instance-name forwarding-options]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show routing-instances
routing-instances {
routing-instance-name {
instance-type vpls;
interface interface-name;
route-distinguisher (as-number:number | ip-address:number);
vrf-import [policy-names];

}
flood { # Mirror ingress flooded traffic
input pm-filter-for-vpls-ri-flooded;
}
}
}
}
}
1174
Applying Layer 2 Port Mirroring to Traffic Forwarded or Flooded to a VLAN
You can apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to traffic being forwarded or flooded to a VLAN.
Only packets of the specified family type and forwarded or flooded to that VLAN are mirrored.
Before you begin, complete the following task:
• Define a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to be applied to the traffic being forwarded to a VLAN
or flooded to a VLAN. For details, see Defining a Layer 2 Port-Mirroring Firewall Filter.
