Web Flow 2 introduces the following prefixes for specifying a location to
redirect to, either via the flow itself using an externalRedirect: or a
managing FlowHandler, which is a Spring MVC integration class. It should be
possible to get the same level of control in Spring MVC, and we should try to
make the semantics as consistent as possible between MVC and Web Flow:
Web Flow 2 location redirect rules:
  * The following prefixes are supported for qualifying the returned location string:
  * 
*
servletRelative: - the location is relative to the current servlet  
*
contextRelative: - the location is relative to the current web
application  
*
serverRelative: - the location is relative to the server root  
*
url: - the location is a fully qualified URL to an external resource  
*
  * Also, if the returned location no prefix, for example "/hotels/index", the location is treated as relative to the
  * current servlet by default.
  * 
  * For servlet-relative, context-relative, and server-relative URLs, a leading slash is optional.
Within an XML flow, the externalRedirect directive to request a redirect to a
location would look like this:
externalRedirect:/servlet-relative-path  
externalRedirect:servletRelative:/path  
externalRedirect:contextRelative:/path  
externalRedirect:serverRelative:/path  
externalRedirect:url:http://whatever
* * *
