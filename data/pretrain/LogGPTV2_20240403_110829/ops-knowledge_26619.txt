User: So I'm using Apache Kafka as a message queue to relay a Twitter Stream to my consumers. If I want to go back, I want to have a value (offset) which I can send Kafka. So, for eg, if I want to go back one day, I have no idea what the offset would be for that. 
Hence, can I set the offset manually? Maybe a linux/epoch timestamp?
Assistant: Don't see how that would be possible, but instead you can:

Use Kafka's API to obtain an offset that is earlier than a given time (getOffsetBefore). Note that the granularity depends on your storage file size IIRC and thus you can get an offset that is quite a bit earlier than the time you specified
Keep a timestamp in the message itself and use it in conjunction with above to skip messages
Keep an external index of time->offset yourself and use that
