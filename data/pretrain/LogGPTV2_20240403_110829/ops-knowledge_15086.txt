User: Setup: Celery 3.1, broker=RabbitMQ, backend=Redis.
Scenario:
Having a task is state=STARTED (running) my worker is being restarted. I'm getting worker: Warm shutdown (MainProcess) message (stdout). The worker successfully restarted but the task is stuck on STARTED state (monitored via flower) and nothing happen. 
Desired state: I wish that the stuck task will run again (or fail before the shutdown) - and not be ignored and left as 'STARTED' forever.
Assistant: Using CELERY_ACKS_LATE = True solved the problem
