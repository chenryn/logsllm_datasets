User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Enable right-click on HP thin clients -t5720 I'm setting up a computer laboratory with used thin client 
for a school.

I have everything intact, however, I prefer that each rdp session will
start automatically once the thin client boots.

one way i know this could be achieved is to save the rdp as a shortcut and 
drag it into the startup menu items.

Nonetheless, I'm unable to achieve this since right click is disabled.

I have downloaded and reinstalled the xp Embedded os, hoping that it would 
clear the right-click context menu lock down but no dice.

Is there anyway to remove that restriction or achieve the above goal 
without the need for right-click?

My host pc is a Windows 7 professional system.
All thin clients' model is T5720

Thanks in advance.
