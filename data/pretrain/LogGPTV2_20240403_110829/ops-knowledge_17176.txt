Question: "As a security analyst, you have been tasked with evaluating the caching strategy used by a web application. Which of the following approaches to caching could potentially prevent Web Cache Deception attacks, and what would be a significant disadvantage of that approach?"
 "A": "Classifying and handling cached content based on file extension, but it could potentially cause false cache hits and serve incorrect content to users."
 "B": "Using content-type to determine caching policies, but this might lead to a higher server load since it requires a more dynamic analysis of content."
 "C": "Implementing cache-control headers strictly, but it may restrict some user experience features requiring frequent content updates."
 "D": "Allowing all user-generated paths to be cached, but this increases the risk of sensitive data exposure through cache-based attacks."
