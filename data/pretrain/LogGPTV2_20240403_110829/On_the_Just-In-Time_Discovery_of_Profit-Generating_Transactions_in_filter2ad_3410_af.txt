SUMMARY OF THE ERC-20 CRYPTOCURRENCY ASSETS
APPENDIX A
We summarize the 24 ERC-20 cryptocurrency assets in
Table III. We observe that for most of the assets, the number of
holders and the number of markets increases with the number
of transfer transactions.
APPENDIX B
SUPPORTED DEFI ACTIONS
We summarize the 96 DeFi actions DEFIPOSER supports in
Table IV. All considered cryptocurrency assets trade on both
the Uniswap and Bancor exchanges. SAI and DAI, in addition,
can be converted to each on MakerDAO.
APPENDIX C
SMT ENCODING EXAMPLE
To ease the understanding of the encoding process between
the State Transition Model and the SMT problem, we consider
in the following a simple strategy with only two actions, and
a trader holding two cryptocurrency assets: a base cryptocur-
rency asset c1, and another cryptocurrency asset c2.

TABLE IV: List of the supported DeFi actions of DEFIPOSER.
Action a1: Converts x1 amount of c1 to c2, using a constant
product market (cf. Section II-A), with liquidity L1c1 for c1
and L1c2 for c2 (cf. Equation 14).
output amount of c2 = L1c2 −
L1c1L1c2
(L1c1 + x1)
(14)
Action a2: Converts x2 amount of c2 back to c1, using another
constant product market, with liquidity L2c1 and L2c2. Based
on Heuristic 5 (cf. Section V-B), action a2 must use another
market, because otherwise the conversion becomes a reversing
action of a1, which would result in a zero-sum game with a
loss on transaction fees.
Initial state encoding: Equation 15 encodes the state variables
with concrete values, which are fetched from the considered
blockchain state (e.g., the most recent block). This predicate
can also be viewed as the assignment of an initial state.
predicate t1(·) :=
T
0 (c1) = Trader’s initial c1 balance ∧
B
T
0 (c2) = Trader’s initial c2 balance ∧
B
L1c1
0 = Market 1 initial c1 balance ∧
L1c2
0 = Market 1 initial c2 balance ∧
L2c1
0 = Market 2 initial c1 balance ∧
L2c2
0 = Market 2 initial c2 balance
(15)
Action encoding: The following two predicates encode the
two state transition actions. Equation 16 encodes F(s0, a1, x1)
and Equation 17 encodes F(F(s0, a1, x1), a2, x2). Simply
speaking, predicate t2 transacts cryptocurrency asset c1 to c2,
and predicate t3 converts c2 back to c1.
