User: In linux, how can I determine the default text editor, terminal, etc?
does it vary by distro?
Assistant: The resolution order is $EDITOR -> editor -> some predefined list of console editors. On Debian/Ubuntu, sensible-editor (and sensible-browser and sensible-pager) will do the lookup for you, including looking at the right environment variables. Similar variables are $PAGER, $SHELL, $BROWSER. To look up a file association, you can use xdg-open.
