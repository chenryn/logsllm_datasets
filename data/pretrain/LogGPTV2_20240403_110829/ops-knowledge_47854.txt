User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unable to login to a domain computer using a Local Administrator account I have a server running on windows server 2008. Recently we created a domain and added it to the domain. Also it is promoted as an additional domain controller on the network. A domain user account was created with same username and password as my previous local administrator account. Now I unable to login using my local account. I tried loggin in using SERVERNAME\Username, but it is giving incorrect password error message. Is there any way I can retrieve or create a new local administrator account on a domain computer

Assistant: Is the machine a Domain Controller?  If so, you lose the ability to log in as a local account.  You would have to demote the DC in order to log in as a local account.
