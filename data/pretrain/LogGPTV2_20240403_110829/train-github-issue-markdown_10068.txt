### Describe the issue:
I am experiencing a NumPy crash in a rather complicated environment. I have a
Fortran+MPI application, GEOS (https://github.com/geos-esm) that calls a
Python function at some point via a CFFI interface. My application crashes
every time I try to 'import numpy' and the traceback looks like what is
included in the 'Error message' section for each of the MPI ranks.
Via test_crash_interface, FV_StateMod.F90 calls the Python function
def import_numpy():  
import numpy as np  
print('imported numpy successfully')
The application runs successfully if I do not import numpy. Also, I can import
other modules, e.g. mpi4py, just fine.
I tried to create a reproducer that simulates the GEOS infrastructure by using
a simple Fortran driver, but in case of the reproducer, numpy is imported
successfully. Also, I tried pybind11 instead of cffi as the Fortran-Python
interface and I get the same crash.
Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide.
### Reproduce the code example:
    Via test_crash_interface, FV_StateMod.F90 calls the Python function
    def import_numpy():
        import numpy as np
        print('imported numpy successfully')
### Error message:

### NumPy/Python version information:
My environment is as follows:
GCC 11.2.0  
Python 3.8.10  
NumPy 1.21.2 (same crash with 1.21.5 and 1.22.0)  
CFFI 1.15.0
I have reproduced this error on 2 different systems - (1) Intel Cascade Lake
node running SLES 12, SP5, and (2) AMD Rome node running CentOS 7.
