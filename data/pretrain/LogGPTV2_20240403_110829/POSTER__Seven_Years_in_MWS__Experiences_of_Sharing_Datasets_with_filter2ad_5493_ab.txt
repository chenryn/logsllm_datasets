# MWS Community in Accelerating Anti-Malware Research

Over the past seven years, the MWS (Malware Workshop) community has made significant strides in advancing anti-malware research. Below, we summarize our key achievements and the strategies that have contributed to our success.

## Key Successes

### Data
- **Packet Traces**: Among the datasets provided, packet traces have been particularly popular, attracting many new researchers. These datasets are well-suited for various analyses, including machine learning.
- **Standardization**: The synchronization of formats and collection periods across different datasets facilitates the identification of common and distinct trends in attacks. This standardization also allows for more flexible updates to keep pace with evolving threats.

### Lowering Obstacles
- **Data Collection**: By sharing datasets, we have reduced the technical barriers associated with data collection.
- **Access Simplification**: We have simplified the process for accessing these datasets, making them available to any researcher interested in anti-malware research.
- **Language Support**: To ensure inclusivity, we provide dataset descriptions in Japanese, thereby lowering language barriers for non-English speakers.

## Community Growth
- **Number of Groups**: The number of participating groups has steadily increased, from 28 in 2008 to 86 in 2014. Additionally, 17 new research groups have emerged from the community.
- **Published Papers**: A total of 30 research papers using MWS datasets have been published, demonstrating the community's impact on the field.

## Related Work
- **MALICIA Project**: Provides 11,688 labeled malware samples collected over 11 months.
- **Android Malware Genome Project**: Shares over 1,200 Android malware samples, released to 370 institutions as of March 13, 2014.
- **PREDICT**: A repository with 430 datasets from 9 providers, accessible to researchers in the USA and selected countries.
- **WOMBAT Project**: Organizes open workshops (BADGERS) and aims to gather, enrich, and analyze security-related raw data.

While these projects serve as valuable repositories, MWS stands out by not only conducting workshops but also organizing competitions.

## Conclusion
This paper highlights the experiences and achievements of the MWS community over the past seven years. Our efforts in sharing datasets, simplifying access, and reducing language barriers have significantly accelerated and expanded anti-malware research. We believe our experiences can benefit other research communities with similar goals. Moving forward, we plan to expand our activities globally in response to increasing international interest.
