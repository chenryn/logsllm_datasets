MWS community in accelerating anti-malware research.
We summarize our key successes obtained over the past
seven years in the MWS community as follows.
(cid:15) Data: among the datasets provided, packet traces have
attracted the most newcomers. These datasets are suited
for performing various analyses such as machine learning.
In addition, the synchronization of the formats and col-
lection periods of diﬀerent datasets facilitates the identi-

(cid:15) Lowering obstacles :
(cid:12)cation of common and separate trends of attack. More-
over, the types of datasets have been (cid:13)exibly updated to
remain abreast of threat transitions in the wild.
the MWS community has at-
tempted to lower the various barriers to new research
as much as possible. First, as previously mentioned, we
lowered the technical obstacles of data collection by shar-
ing datasets. Second, because our intent was to make the
datasets available to any researcher wishing to conduct
anti-malware research using datasets, we simpli(cid:12)ed the
procedure for accessing these datasets as much as pos-
sible. We believe that these measures were eﬀective for
lowering the obstacles to new and enterprising research.
Finally, to avoid the neglect of students who are less ca-
pable with the English language, we provided the descrip-
tions of the datasets in Japanese. Thus, we lowered the
barriers associated with language.
4. RELATED WORK
Among several shared datasets in the research commu-
nity, we review some examples that run parallel to our own.
The MALICIA Project [13] provides 11,688 labeled malware
samples collected over a period of 11 months. The Android
Malware Genome Project [14] shares over 1,200 Android
malware samples. As of March 13, 2014, this project has
been released to 370 universities, research labs, and com-
panies. However, these two activities may be better re-
ferred to as research data repositories rather than research
communities such as that of MWS. The closest activities
to our own are PREDICT [7] in the USA and the WOM-
BAT project [8] in the EU. PREDICT shares 430 datasets
consisting of 13 categories contributed by 9 data providers.
Researchers in the USA and selected countries are approved
to create accounts and to access the repository. WOMBAT
has organized open workshops, known as BADGERS work-
shops, since 2011. This project aims to gather security re-
lated raw data, enrich the data by analytical techniques, and
provide root cause analysis to project member. Unlike these
two activities, MWS not only conducts workshops but also
conducts competitions.
5. CONCLUSION
This paper has sought to describe our experiences of the
past seven years with sharing datasets in the research com-
munity. The quantitative analysis regarding the growth
of the research community and research outcomes demon-
strated that MWS was able to accelerate and expand the
activities of anti-malware research. For instance, 17 new
research groups have arisen from the community and 30 re-
search papers using MWS Datasets have been published so
far. The experiences of the past seven years have revealed
the eﬀectiveness associated with lowering various barriers
to entry in this (cid:12)eld, i.e., facilitated data collection, simple
procedure for accessing the datasets, and the reduction of
language barriers. We believe that our experiences can as-
sist other research communities that have a similar vision
and comparable objectives. We are now planning to expand
our activities to the global research community in response
to several requests for accessing the MWS Datasets from
researchers in other countries.
