by **hongruiqi** :
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    http.Handle("/test///a", Handler)
    And visit http://localhost/test/%2f/a
    What is the expected output?
    Handler should be called.
    What do you see instead?
    The browser is redirected to /test/a, and a 404 error
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    6g
    Which operating system are you using?
    linux
    Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')
    go version devel +0d9fd828f099 Wed Jan 30 17:26:22 2013 +1100 linux/amd64.
    Please provide any additional information below.
    if p := cleanPath(path); p != path {
        _, pattern = mux.handler(r.Host, p)
        return RedirectHandler(p, StatusMovedPermanently), pattern
    }
    If path is a raw path before unescapeï¼Œ/test/%2f/a can be handled correctly without
    redirect. mux.match can use r.URL.Path as before.
