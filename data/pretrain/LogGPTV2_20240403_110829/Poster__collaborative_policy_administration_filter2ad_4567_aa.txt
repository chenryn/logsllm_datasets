INTRODUCTION
Ezio Manzini and Eduardo Staszowski
RESEARCH NOTES
1. An interesting phenomenon is emerging worldwide: more and more people are 
organizing to solve daily problems together and are collaborating with each other 
to live more socially cohesive and sustainable lives. This active and collaborative 
attitude, driven by several social and economic factors, is also based on a 
technological pre-condition: the diffusion of technologies that creates the conditions 
for new interactions and expands people’s social networks. This connectivity 
enables people to establish direct links between interested peers and opens new 
opportunities for meaningful activism and effective collaborations. In turn, this link 
between active behaviors and new technologies is spurring unprecedented forms of 
organization in the arenas of economics, politics, and daily life. In brief, a large and 
deep wave of social innovations is emerging.
2. When they occur, these everyday social innovations are fragile and highly localized 
entities. To endure and diffuse beyond local communities, they must be recognized 
and supported. In other words, they would benefit from public actions that would 
facilitate peer-to-peer collaborations. The result would be a new generation of public 
services: collaborative services where end users become service co-producers. As 
a benefit, promising social innovations could then become powerful and positive 
drivers of public innovation.
3. In the face of current economic and social challenges, many agree that the 
relationship between people and the public sector in general and public services in 
particular should be radically reshaped. Of course, there is no one simple strategy to 
do this. But it appears clearer and clearer that to move in this direction a promising 
strategy could be based on the opportunities opened by these collaborations, the 
creative use of existing technologies, and the brand new organizations they make 
possible. 
4. In short, current societal challenges are creating pressure for the public sector to 
increase effectiveness and deliver better services. Greater public collaboration offers 
two promising paths for public service improvements: 
The first could be called a people-centered approach—more intensive involvement 
of end-users in research, prototyping, testing, and implementation of services to be 
delivered by public agencies. 
The second strategy may be called people-led services—engagement of agencies and 
citizens in a co-production process, whereby users design and implement their own 
service programs, enabled and supported by public agencies.
i
5. In this context three main questions arise:  How can emerging social networks 
influence the development of public services and innovation policies? How can 
innovation policies trigger, empower, and direct emerging social networks? What can 
design do to make these promising connections more effective and fruitful? These same 
questions provided the starting point for the “Public & Collaborative Thematic 
Cluster,” a design research initiative started in October 2011 and promoted by DESIS 
Network, the international network of design labs committed to promoting design 
for social innovation and sustainability. (See also Box 1, DESIS Thematic Clusters, and 
Box 2, “Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster.”)
DESIGN SCHOOLS AND THE PUBLIC REALM
1. Design schools can act as drivers for the diffusion of design for social innovations. 
In other words, design schools (and, more generally, design-oriented universities) can 
become places where new visions are generated, new tools are defined and tested, 
and new projects are started and supported. If a worldwide movement towards 
sustainability calls for the best possible use of all existing resources, design schools, 
with all their social capital in terms of students’ enthusiasm and faculty experience, 
should be considered a very promising social resource and a promoter of sustainable 
change.
• 
• 
Opportunities: design schools can bring fresh ideas into the 
social conversation, have the tools to build prototypes, and, most 
importantly, have the freedom to ask questions and think critically.
Limitations:  when students are involved there are problems of 
timing (i.e., academic calendar) and maturity. While some activities 
can be accomplished very well by students, others are very difficult 
if not impossible. 
2. The DESIS network and the DESIS Labs in particular—the teams of faculty, 
researchers, and students who orient their teaching and research activities towards 
social innovation and sustainability—offer extraordinary possibilities to bring into 
the social conversation fresh ideas and visions, to develop original research projects, 
to realize working prototypes, to define special tools, and, most importantly, to 
elaborate critical thoughts.
OPEN QUESTIONS
This book documents and presents some reflections on efforts of DESIS Labs 
in Europe, Canada, and the United States that are participating in the “Public 
& Collaborative Thematic Cluster.” Here, in the spirit of open-ended discussion 
characteristic of the DESIS Thematic Clusters, we would like to conclude this 
introduction with several observations presented in the form of three questions.
Open Question #1: How do public agencies change when people are not considered a problem 
but instead part of the solution?
DESIS Labs in Europe, Canada, and the United States learned how complicated it 
can be to openly discuss the role of the state in people’s lives and the sensitivity of 
ii
proposing new partnership models between governments and a number of different 
actors to effect social change in the public realm. These are politically loaded issues, 
causing concern among policymakers and skepticism among the public.
Reflecting on different experiences, while trying to discuss and promote service 
co-production ideas, the labs realized that the challenge is not only to learn how to 
empower the public in order to transform public services, but also how to empower 
public agencies and civil servants. Thus, we would like to start this conversation by 
reframing our initial “Public & Collaborative” question in this way: How do public 
agencies change when people are considered part of the solution—i.e., when people 
become main actors in the process of conceiving and delivering public services?
In the current stage of our cluster’s activities this question appears to be more and 
more important. Several public sector partners involved in different projects and cities 
considered the “Public & Collaborative” principle on which this question is based as 
a promising direction for highly needed innovations in the public sector. However, 
this approach appears to be politically infeasible or difficult to implement in some 
contexts, especially when the burden is on public agencies to take the lead (i.e., 
when they are required to do more than react to the demands of strong bottom-up 
initiatives) or when proposals do not fall directly within the agency’s mandate. 
Nevertheless when discussing social innovations and institutional change in 
the public sector, the political dimension of these themes emerges with great 
controversy. In fact, when it is suggested that supplementing conventional public 
services with collaborative co-produced services, these proposals can easily become, 
BOX 1: DESIS THEMATIC CLUSTERS
Thematic Clusters are groups of design teams, based in different DESIS Labs, 
that are working on similar topics. Their aim is to build arenas for discussing 
ongoing projects, comparing tools and results, and provide a site where new 
joint initiatives can be started.
Thematic Clusters are initiatives of the DESIS Network which aim to create 
focused design research environments where specific design knowledge is 
produced and accumulated, where—in relation to a given design theme—a 
common language is built, a set of conceptual and practical tools created, 
and scenarios and solutions developed. A Thematic Cluster emerges from 
ongoing activities, thanks to the initiative of the DESIS Labs who, recognizing 
their common or converging interests, decide to align ongoing activities, 
establish a coordinated program of events, and, when possible, start up 
future joint activities. 
iii
or at least be interpreted as, ways to reduce the role of public agencies rather than 
ways, as our work suggests, to change their nature. We propose to change public 
agencies’ responsibility or commitment to the public. To change public agencies’ 
nature means to shift their role from one chiefly of service providers towards one 
chiefly of people’s active partners (i.e., agencies capable of supporting and, if needed, 
triggering and orienting people’s collaborative participation). 
“To change public agencies’ nature means to shift 
their role from one chiefly of service providers 
towards one chiefly of people’s active partners”
Open Question #2: Social innovation can trigger public sector innovations. Is the opposite 
possible too? 
When a particularly strong grassroots initiative appears and, in its early stages, asks 
for the support of public agencies, it may attract support from agencies capable 
of understanding and acting on this request. As an example, we can refer to the 
Community Gardens in New York City where the Parks Department created the Green 
Thumb program to provide technical, material, and financial support to community 
gardeners.
In order to leverage the energy generated by similar initiatives to promote 
innovations in public services and policies, we suggest that public agencies could 
respond in several ways: (1) recognize the value created by these promising 
grassroots initiatives, (2) listen to their explicit or implicit requests, and, 
consequently, (3) decide what to do (and do it) in collaboration with them. Of 
course, every case is different and this capacity to listen, recognize, understand, and 
collaborate needs to be cultivated. Nevertheless, the labs found that in many public 
agencies there are often several enthusiastic civil servants who, if presented with the 
opportunity, are happy to rethink the way public services are delivered.
Open Question #3: Should we create experimental spaces where conceiving and prototyping 
new solutions would be easier?
On the basis of the experiments done to date and the discussions we had around 
several public lectures promoted by the cluster, we suggest that to embrace the 
“Public & Collaborative” approach—i.e., to promote co-created and co-produced 
solutions—public agencies could (directly or indirectly) create “testing environments,” 
or spaces where these new proposals can be tested. 
In fact, this proposed new role of public agencies asks for a 
systemic transformation that cannot be accomplished in the 
normal conditions of their daily business.  In order to make 
it possible (at least in the early phase of this transformation), 
an extraordinary environment has to be created: an experimental 
space where different actors, civil servants included, can meet, 
interact, discuss different possibilities, and develop prototypes to test 
them.

BOX 2:  “PUBLIC & COLLABORATIVE THEMATIC CLUSTER”
1. The “Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster” developed from the empirical observation that 
several design schools and DESIS Labs in Europe, Canada, and the United States were already doing 
research on public services and public realm-related topics and that it would be possible--and 
advantageous--to connect them and create the first DESIS Thematic Cluster. Their research topics 
included affordable housing social integration, neighborhood improvement, healthcare and, more 
generally, public sector innovation policies.
2. The cluster includes the following design schools and DESIS Labs: Parsons The New School for 
Design, New York (coordinator); Politecnico di Milano School of design, Milan (coordinator); Aalto 
University, Helsinki; Designmatters at Art Center College of Design, Pasadena; Carnegie Mellon 
University, Pittsburgh; Central Saint Martins, London; ENSCI, Paris; Institute without Borders, George 
Brown College, Toronto; La Cambre, Brussels; Mad Faculty, Campus Genk, Genk; Malmö University, 
Malmö. These DESIS Labs worked in partnership with several local organizations and with the 
endorsement of MindLab, la 27me Region, Fondazione Housing Sociale, ENOLL-European Network 
of Living Labs; SIX-Social Innovation Exchange and Reciprocity. 
3. These labs converged on three main hypotheses:
• 
• 
• 
The current economic and social challenges have resulted in a crisis of public sector 
organizations' ability to effectively provide various forms of public service.
Social innovations and, in particular, people’s emerging active and collaborative attitude can 
be among the most promising drivers of change of public services. 
Design-led innovation and practices, such as co-governance, co-design, or co-production where 
citizens, experts, and governments can work closely to provide better public services, hold a 
disruptive potential for public sector organizations, but the role designers will have in this 
context is still open for exploration and experimentation.
4. The efforts of the “Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster” during the 2012-2013 period 
included:

sharing pedagogical tools and resources
promoting public lectures
5. In October 2012 a public seminar was organized in partnership with Reciprocity in Liège, Belgium, 
where various DESIS Labs discussed their interactions with local partners and shared processes and 
results. Now, in June 2013, the “Public & Collaborative Thematic Cluster” program is still in progress, 
but some initial outcomes are already evident and are presented in this booklet. The chapters 
include reviewed and updated versions of the papers discussed in Liège. 
On the basis of the experiences to date some challenges and opportunities have been identified. At 
the end of their articles, each author offers specific recommendations for designers, educators, civil 
servants, and policymakers.
v
This idea is based on the DESIS Labs’ experiments, but also, and more importantly, on 
phenomenological observations. Looking at worldwide efforts of active organizations 
trying to promote radical innovations in the public sector, we can observe that 
they have built, or are debating how to build, the types of environments that foster 
experiments. They may have different names in Europe, Canada, and the United 
States (Living Lab, Fab Lab, Change Lab, Innovation Lab), but they share common 
characteristics: they are experimental sites where active and collaborative people 
(i.e., grassroots groups and social innovators) can meet other interested actors (i.e., 
public agencies, planners, designers, investors, etc.)  and work together towards 
innovative solutions to public problems.  
The experiments that these spaces facilitate open two symmetrical opportunities. 
One is the possibility for bottom-up social innovations to move faster in their 
trajectory from the first ‘heroic’ stage (when social inventions are still prototypes) 
to the following stages when more mature enterprises are created and, if necessary, 
when enabling products and services are conceived and enhanced. The other 
opportunity is for public agencies to meet with people and other organizations and 
experiment together with new policies and governance tools. Most importantly, this
