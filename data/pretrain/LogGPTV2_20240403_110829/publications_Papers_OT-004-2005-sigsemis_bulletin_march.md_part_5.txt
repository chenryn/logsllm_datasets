experience analysis should provide useful insights on social and strategic aspects that might
be relevant in the creation and deployment of formal ontologies as well as useful criteria or methods to
evaluate ontologies and their effectiveness in applications.

ESWC2005 Workshop on Voice, Natural Language and Semantic Web Technologies
(VNLSW2005)
http://www.isoco.com/workshops/VNLSW2005/
In this workshop we want to bring together researchers and practitioners from the R&D areas of
Voice Recognition and Generation, of Natural Language Processing and of Ontologies and the Semantic
Web. The main objective is to have discussions about how these different but complimentary
technologies can be integrated together so
ESWC2005 Workshop on "MULTIMEDIA AND THE SEMANTIC WEB"
Call for papers: One day workshop, 29 May 2005
http://www.acemedia.org/ESWC2005_MSW
to be held as part of the 2nd European Semantic Web Conference, Heraklion, Crete
http://www.eswc2005.org/ , 29 May to 1 June 2005
This one day workshop on Multimedia and the Semantic Web aims to bring together researchers and
practitioners in the multimedia and Semantic Web domains in order to assist in forming bridges between the
communities for mutual benefit. European Commission part-funded projects such as aceMedia are already
investigating means to draw benefits from both domains in order to enable advances in multimedia
processing from use of Semantic Web techniques, and to create new multimedia applications in order to
enhance the value of the Semantic Web. In addition, programmes such as the SDK project cluster are
investigating the application of semantic web technology to knowledge management, web services and
eBusiness. It is therefore timely to bring together researchers and practitioners from these two complementary
and closely related areas.
The workshop will include invited papers and peer-reviewed papers received from this Call for Workshop
28

Papers.
Papers are invited on subjects including (but not limited to):
• Knowledge driven multimedia content analysis and understanding Semantic media creation and
processing tools
• Semantic browsing, indexing and retrieval of multimedia content
• Knowledge based inference for semantic media annotation
• User adaptation and relevance feedback
• Language extensions for multimedia
• Multimedia ontologies
• Reasoning on multimedia data
• Knowledge driven multimedia applications and systems
• User evaluations of intelligent multimedia applications
• User Interface design for knowledge driven multimedia applications and systems

Focus
A common obstacle in the transformation of government policy to services for the public and citizens is the
difficulty to establish communication channels that exploit knowledge and support services. In a both push
and pull consideration of flows and requests, knowledge management literature explains in detail the critical
role of the management of artifacts, communication, collaboration and behaviour. In the wide area of
knowledge management several pillars can be identified that potentially promote the e-government. In figure
1, six critical variables are highlighted:

The 6 pillars mentioned can help the formulation of our Knowledge Management Insight in E-government.
The basic idea is that six Performance Factors based on the six pillars provide the basis for the Ubiquitous
Knowledge Management for E-government. In parallel the evolution of Semantic Web poses new challenges
for each of these pillars.
Intended Topics
The topics of the special issue would cover the application and integration of Knowledge Management and
Semantic Web technologies and infrastructures to e-Government. These topics include:
- Knowledge Management Strategies for E-government.
- Knowledge flows and implications to E-government
- Communities of Practices and provision of E-government services
- Semantic Web-enabled resource retrieval in E-Government.
- Social Capital and Ubiquitous E-Government.
- Managing artifacts through ontologies.
- Approaches to annotation of resources for Effective E-government.
- Regulatory ontologies: implications for E-government.
- Scientific knowledge organization and ontologies.
- New roles and competencies of E-government taskforce in Semantic, metadata-intensive institutions.
