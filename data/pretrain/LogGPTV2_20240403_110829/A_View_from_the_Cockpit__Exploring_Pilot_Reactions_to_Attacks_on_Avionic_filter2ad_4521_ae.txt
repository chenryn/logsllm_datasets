to be an extremely important safety system and misuse has
led to crashes—in our work, attacking it resulted in it being
so distracting that pilots felt they had to turn it off. This led to
a contradiction; in theory, the aircraft was less safe as it had a
key safety system turned off, however in practice the crew felt
they were maintaining safe ﬂight by removing a distraction.
As mentioned above, even where outcomes were predicted
on paper, real responses varied, in some cases signiﬁcantly.
This is particularly relevant to the wider industrial security
and safety-critical system community—when we are thinking
about security in complex systems, human operators effectively
become an ampliﬁer of effect and understanding how they
actually behave is vital.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we consider the effects of three wireless
interference attacks on avionic systems with respect to the
ﬂight crew. We implemented the attacks in a ﬂight simulator
and tested how 30 commercial pilots responded. Our results
show that all of the attacks have at least some potential for
disruption, which in turn could lead to a reduction in safety,
ﬁnancial loss or reputational harm. Crucially, participants often
had to make a choice between reducing distraction and turning
off key systems, or keeping said systems on; in over a third
of cases, safety systems were switched off.
Our results identify the attack on TCAS as the most
concerning since it combines widespread inconvenience and
potential safety reduction. Both GS/ILS and GPWS also pose
problems, though are easier to mitigate on the ﬂight deck.
Finally, we conclude that ﬂight simulation for wireless attack
awareness or training has potential to aid and prepare crew.
Since preventative security by design will not be deployable
in the near-term, such training could be highly valuable.

APPENDIX A
TECHNICAL DETAILS ON THE ATTACKS
A. GPWS
A radio altimeter is a Frequency-Modulated Continuous
Wave (FMCW) radar, transmitting pulses on frequency sweeps
between 4200 and 4400 MHz. It uses the frequency shift and
round-trip time for the received signal to calculate the height
above terrain, also referred to as above ground level (AGL). Its
operation is illustrated in Fig. 11, where ∆t is the round-trip
time, and ∆f is the frequency shift.
The attack aims to replicate the rapid closing of ground
by transmitting a ramp of frequencies between 4200 MHz and
4400 MHz. The gradient of this ramp is crafted to incremen-
tally reduce the round-trip time per frequency shift for the
signal, creating the illusion of the ground approaching rapidly.
Fig. 11: Frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar
operation at a static height, for both the transmitted signal and
received, reﬂected signal.
This requires some prediction of the signal phase from the
radio altimeter, as well as knowledge of the sweep frequency—
however this is standardized. Since Mode 2 alerts are based
on the rate of descent, the attacker can at least calculate the
target change in round-trip time (RTT) to trigger an alarm. For
example, descending at 3000 ft/min (≈ 15.4 m/s) at 500 ft AGL
(≈ 152.4 m) will trigger an alarm according to standard (Fig.
A2b in [51]). Using a simple model of the aircraft moving
a negligible amount during a pulse, we use the difference in
RTT over the course of one second (i.e. the aircraft at 152.4 m
AGL, then one second later having descended 15.4 m). Eq. 1
then gives us the required change in is RTT, in which trtt is
RTT, h is height above ground and c is the speed of light. This
indicates a small jump in frequency per round-trip is needed.

messages [47]. The type of injection then depends on whether
they use Mode S or Mode C:
• Mode S: the attacker transmits a false aircraft squitter
message. When the target aircraft then interrogates,
the attacker transmits Mode S responses as if the false
aircraft were traveling on a collision course with the
target.
• Mode C:
the attacker responds to an all-call and
following interrogations for the false aircraft. Whisper-
shout may cause interrogations to be too low power to
be received by the attacker, in which case they would
need to approximate a response. However, this would
be stochastic as interrogation rates are standardized.

from response.
Fig. 12: Representation of TCAS interrogation protocols of
nearby aircraft using Mode C and S transponders.
An attacker will need a number of directional antennae
underneath the approach path to transmit to the radio altimeter.
These will be fed by SDRs; such equipment would be in the
low $1000s. Although an attacker could operate such a system
remotely, the hardware would need to be located near to the
runway. The ability to deploy consequently depends on the
airﬁeld security and perimeter size, an analysis of which is
not in our scope.
B. TCAS
TCAS makes use of the Mode C or Mode S transponders
ﬁtted to an object aircraft to interrogate nearby aircraft [17].
Establishing nearby aircraft with Mode S requires the object
aircraft to listen for IDs in Mode S ‘squitters’, which are
messages in response to ground-based Secondary Surveillance
Radar (SSR) interrogations. The object aircraft can then in-
terrogate these IDs to calculate whether nearby aircraft will
become too close [18]. An abstracted protocol diagram can be
seen in Fig. 12a.
Mode C operates differently, shown in Fig. 12b. The
object aircraft issues Mode C-only interrogations called all-
calls, causing all nearby aircraft with Mode C transponders to
respond once a second with their altitude. Since Mode C does
not carry the same data ﬁelds as Mode S, the object aircraft
estimates range and bearing [20]. To limit interference, it uses
a whisper-shout transmission mechanism, gradually increasing
power and suppressing aircraft who already responded.
Attacks on TCAS are feasible as all discussed underlying
transmissions are sent in the clear with no authentication.
Sch¨afer et. al. exploit
the weakness of such transponder
transmissions [43] and the same fundamental wireless attack
concepts can be translated to TCAS.
We ﬁrstly presume that we can establish the altitude, head-
ing and speed of the target aircraft from broadcast surveillance
16
The attacker can choose whether to cause the target to climb
or descend by injecting an aircraft below or above the object
aircraft respectively.
Transmission by the attacker would require an off-the-shelf
ampliﬁer and antenna capable of directional transmission, with
a high-powered setup costing $15,000. A transceiver is needed
to both receive interrogations to establish the target aircraft
behavior, as well as transmitting false aircraft messages.
C. ILS/GS
No signiﬁcant technical barriers exist for an ILS attack.
This is possible due to the simplistic nature of the system—
whilst it is monitored for integrity as deﬁned in ICAO Annex
10, this is for deviations in the legitimate signal rather than
malicious interference [27]. An ILS system will normally shut
down or notify ATC if excessive deviation is identiﬁed.
An attacker will need an SDR, ampliﬁer and directional
antennae to replicate the antennae arrays used for the legitimate
GS, costing around $10,000. Since no open-source tools exist
to do this, software would need to be created but this is
achievable by moderately resourced attacker as it involves
implementing a standardized, static system. Furthermore, the
transmission power is readily achievable with consumer am-
pliﬁers as a typical GS is below 10 W. For reference, even
the lowest level of licensed UK amateur radio operators can
transmit in frequency bands surrounding aviation bands at up
to 10 W [35].
Related work suggests that ILS course deviation attacks
are possible using such equipment. Sathaye et al. describe two
signal generation approaches which enable ILS signal interfer-
ence, leading to an attacker being able to adjust the localizer
or glideslope as seen in the cockpit [40]. This is fundamentally
the same type of attack as we test in the simulator, made
possible with the same equipment and resource level as in
our threat model.
Similar to our GPWS attack, the attacker will have to
locate close to the airport perimeter to have correct signal
directionality along the runway.
