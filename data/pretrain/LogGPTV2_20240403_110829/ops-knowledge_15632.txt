User: How to use Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group to implement highly available application system on AWS cloud platform?
Assistant: The following steps are required to implement a highly available application system: 1. Create an Auto Scaling group: Create an Auto Scaling group in the AWS console, and select the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type to be used. Autoscaling policies can also be configured to dynamically add or remove instances based on demand. 2. Create an Elastic Load Balancer: Create an Elastic Load Balancer in the AWS console and configure it to distribute traffic among the instances spawned in the Auto Scaling group. A load balancer ensures that requests are evenly distributed among instances, preventing a single instance from being overloaded and failing. 3. Configure automatic scaling: Set the startup configuration for the instance in the created Auto Scaling group, adjust the configured automatic scaling policy to respond to traffic changes and dynamically increase or decrease the number of instances when needed. Auto-scaling ensures system stability and reliability. When the number of instances increases, the Elastic Load Balancer distributes requests to new instances, and when the number of instances decreases, the load balancer removes instances from the cluster and ensures that traffic continues to be evenly distributed to other instances. So configured, during periods of peak traffic, the system automatically scales to handle large amounts of traffic, and during periods of low traffic, the system scales down instances to save costs.
