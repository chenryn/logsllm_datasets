# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18941.1001]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): commit id c97cccb
# Steps to reproduce
Open tab too fast and many of them.  
Using shortcut key(default ctrl+shift+number) makes easy to open lots of tab
at once
Which I was doing was holding shortcut key(crtl+shift+2 to open cmd) for few
seconds.
# Expected behavior
Only one tab open or Lots of tabs opens without any problem.
# Actual behavior
Terminal crashes (without any error message)
