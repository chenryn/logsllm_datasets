I am using the modal dialog on a Grails based application. The first time I
click a link (using the  tag) my action is fired as I can see in my
debugger and I'm able to operate on data. Any link clicked afterwards is no
longer 'loading' the URL specified by data-remote so the same dialog from the
first attempt is displayed over and over.
I am assuming that this would work correctly in the javascript version. Is
there no way for this to work with the data api version?
