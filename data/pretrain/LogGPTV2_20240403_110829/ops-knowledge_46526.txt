I have been attempting to use Eclipse 3.6 as a Python editor and have installed the latest version of PyDev. When I try to set the "Interpreter - Python" field in the preferences on my Mac, I encounter an issue.

My Python version is 2.6, and the path is `/usr/bin/python`. After entering this path and selecting the items to add to the system `PYTHONPATH`, I receive the following error message:

```
Error: Python stdlib not found
It seems that the Python /Lib folder (which contains the standard library) was not found/selected during the installation process.
This folder (which contains files such as threading.py and traceback.py) is required for PyDev to function properly (and it must contain the actual source files, not only .pyc files).
```

I am unable to configure the interpreter path in Eclipse. I have already tried reinstalling PyDev, but the problem persists.

Additionally, based on Praveen's suggestion, I confirmed that my Python library is located at `/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages`. When I enter `/usr/bin/python` into the interpreter field, Eclipse prompts me to select paths to add to the `PYTHONPATH`. One of the checkboxes includes the `/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages` path. I check this along with other relevant boxes, but after clicking "OK," I still receive the same error.

After upgrading to Mountain Lion (10.8.2), I faced this issue. The solution was to install Xcode 4.5.2 and then, in Xcode > Preferences > Components, install the Command Line Tools. This allowed me to successfully configure the Python interpreter in Eclipse.

If anyone has additional suggestions or solutions, I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you!
