I think that cloning a scene and using the original scene in one renderer and
the cloned scene in another renderer should be possible. Currently there is a
conflict where the two renderers think they are sharing resources.
I have created a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vAxYx/ to demonstrate. At the
bottom, if both renderers are enabled you get in the console a lot of warning
messages which boil down to sharing resources between the renderers. If either
renderer is used then everything is fine.
