Subject: Configuration Issue with Apache 2.2 and mod_python

Hello,

I am encountering an error while configuring Apache 2.2 or mod_python, and I need some assistance to resolve it. The error message is as follows:

```
MOD_PYTHON ERROR

Interpreter:    '127.0.1.1'

    raise AttributeError, s
AttributeError: module '/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/pywps/__init__.pyc' contains no 'handler'
```

This configuration is for an Ubuntu 10.04 system running on an AMD64 architecture.

Could you please provide guidance on how to configure Apache 2.2 or mod_python to avoid this error?

Thank you for your help.

Solution:
In my case, the issue was resolved by changing the `PythonHandler` directive from:

```
PythonHandler pywps
```

to:

```
PythonHandler wps
```

in the `.htaccess` file (or the Apache configuration file). It appears that the `pywps.py` file has been renamed to `wps.py`, and the sample configuration file still references the old name, causing the error.

I hope this solution helps others facing a similar issue.
