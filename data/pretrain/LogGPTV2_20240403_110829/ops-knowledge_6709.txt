User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题OpenLDAP server ignores URI configuration I set up two hosts with OpenLDAP in N-way multi master replication by following this website. One of the installations is a Debian 9.2, the other one is Ubuntu 16.04. The troubled Ubuntu host runs the OpenLDAP server without problems since a couple of weeks. However, after I added the replication, it refused to start again.

Regular start fails

On the fresh Debian host, the server starts fine - only replication is set up. On the Ubuntu host, OpenLDAP refuses to start. When trying to started with

$ service slapd start


the syslog says

read_config: no serverID / URL match found. Check slapd -h arguments.  


Foreground start fails

The same when run in foreground mode,

$ slapd -d -1


Foreground start with -h works

Surprisingly, it works when appending the -h option

$ slapd -d -1 -h ldap2.myhost.loc


Config ignored?

The setting in the configuration seems to be ignored completely:

$ grep -v '^$' /etc/ldap/ldap.conf | grep -v '^#'
BASE    dc=myldapdomain,dc=loc
URI ldap://ldap2.myhost.loc
TLS_CACERT  /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt


although it is loaded:

$ slapd -d -1
ldap_url_parse_ext(ldap://localhost/)
ldap_init: trying /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
ldap_init: using /etc/ldap/ldap.conf


What am I missing on the OpenLDAP installation on the Ubuntu host in order to start the server successfully?

Assistant: Your -h argument to slapd should contain an LDAP URI that matches one of the values listed for the olcServerID attribute. So following the documentation you linked to you would use -h "ldapi:// ldap://ldap1.gremaud.local" (note the -h value should be quoted to list multiple whitespace-separated URI's as one value). Without that, my understanding is the server can't work out which server ID is itself from the values of the olcServerID attribute, hence the error.

I don't think /etc/ldap/ldap.conf has anything to do with this, it's a client configuration file.
