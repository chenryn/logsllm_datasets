### Detailed Description
**Test Logs:**
```
[----------] 1 test from Core_globbing
[ RUN      ] Core_globbing.accuracy
/sources/opencv-3.4.2/modules/core/test/test_io.cpp:552: Failure
Expected: (lenas.size()) > (pngLenas.size()), actual: 0 vs 0

This is not the only failing test.

**Current Recipe:** [haikuports/haikuports#2891](https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/pull/2891)

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```sh
   mkdir build_haiku && cd build_haiku
   ```
2. Configure the build using CMake:
   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```sh
   make test
   ```

**Observation:**
Based on my initial analysis, it appears that the test cases may be failing because they cannot locate the required assets files. However, I am not entirely certain of this.

If you have any additional information or need further assistance, please let me know.
