I have the web application context and the servlet context converted from xml
to java config. The web.xml is updated according to the online documentation
example. I use `@Autowire` annotation in the servlet config to get the beans
required for the form controllers. I have autowired the web application
context config class, too, as I want to retrieve some fields from there that I
have `@Value` annotated, by calling some type converting methods. The
autowiring seems to fail as I get Nullpointer exceptions on lines where the
webapp config class method is called. I was debugging the server: the web
application context has been built using the config class and the fields I
want to call methods on are filled properly. The `@Autowired` config field is
null when the `@Bean` annotated method wants to use it.
Here some short example lines from our project:
web.xml:
    ...
    ...
          contextClass
          org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
          contextConfigLocation
          com.ourcompany.ServletConfig
    ...
    ...
        contextClass
              org.springframework.web.context.support.AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext
        contextConfigLocation
          com.ourcompany.ApplicationConfig
    ...
ServletConfig.java:
    ...
    @Configuration
    @ImportResource("classpath:/META-INF/iem/servletPropertyConfigurer.xml")
    public class ServletConfig
    {
    ...
      @Autowired
      private ApplicationConfig applicationConfig;
    ...
      @Bean
      public DbStatsController dbStatsController()
      {
        DbStatsController controller = new DbStatsController();
        controller.setManageUrl(applicationConfig.getDatabaseManageUrl());
    ...
        return controller;
      }
    ...
ApplicationConfig.java:
    @Configuration("applicationConfig")
    @ImportResource({
        "classpath:/META-INF/..." })
    public class ApplicationConfig
    {
    ...
      @Value("$[database.manage.url]")
      private String databaseManageUrl;
    ...
      public String getDatabaseManageUrl()
      {
        return databaseManageUrl;
      }
Following the documentation a Config class can be autowired like any other
bean, but it doesn't work here. and I don't get a BeanNotFound or similar
exception, it just fails with a NullpointerException when trying to access the
autowired field.
