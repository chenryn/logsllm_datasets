User: Please provide a Linux command line tool for recovering accidentally deleted files, and introduce its usage and precautions.
Assistant: It is recommended to use "extundelete" as a Linux command-line tool for recovering accidentally deleted files. How to use: 1. Install the extundelete tool: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install extundelete 2. Find the partition where the accidentally deleted file is located: sudo fdisk -l 3. Use the following command to restore the accidentally deleted file: sudo extundelete /dev/ sdaX --restore-file /path/to/your/file Precautions: 1. Extundelete must be run on the partition where the file was accidentally deleted, so the partition of the file must be determined to avoid the file being overwritten after restoration. 2. The recovered files must be saved to another partition, otherwise the existing data may be overwritten and the files may be damaged. 3. Extundelete is only applicable to EXT series file systems. 4. If the partition is formatted or the data is overwritten, the files cannot be recovered.
