users in each country across each speed tier.
Such a signiﬁcant diﬀerence could be explained by the much
higher costs of faster service levels in Botswana where, for
instance, a 2 Mbps plan costs about $200 (PPP) per month!
Figure 8c shows a similar, but less pronounced trend in
Saudi Arabia. The large majority of users in Saudi Arabia
have capacities around 4 Mbps, in the 1 to 8 Mbps download
throughput-rate range. Compared to broadband users in the
US on the same tier, we also ﬁnd higher utilization of the link
in Saudi Arabia,. Speciﬁcally, for users in the 1 to 8 Mbps
group, the median link utilization increases from about 43%
in the US to 60% in Saudi Arabia.
At the other end of the spectrum is Japan, shown in
Fig. 8d. Here we ﬁnd that,
for the majority of users,
links tend to be very under-utilized, with an average link
utilization of 10%. Overall, the fraction of the link utilized
is similar to the same tier in the US, though it is slightly
higher, on average, in the US.
In Botswana, for example, users with less than 1 Mbps
service used 410 kbps on average versus 286 kbps in the
same tier in the US. Additionally, Fig. 9 shows that the
demand on the network is 676 kbps (37%) higher in Saudi
Arabia than on the same tier in the US. In fact, the average
demand of the 8-16 Mbps tier in the US is only 39% higher
than the 1-8 Mbps tier in Saudi Arabia, but is 90% higher
than the 1-8 Mbps tier in the US. This diﬀerence supports
our belief that the relatively high price of Internet access in
the country, rather than user need, is preventing users in
this market from signing up for faster services.

32 Mbps use 830 kbps more than users on the same tier in
Japan. Despite the fact that the cost of broadband access
is similar in both Japan and the US, the availability of
faster services at a lower cost leads subscribers to sign up
for services that will be less heavily used. We examine this
trend in the next section. Figure 9 shows the average peak
demand for diﬀerent tiers in each country. We note that
in the US, demand increases on each tier, despite the fact
that the fraction of the link utilized decreased (shown in
Fig. 8a). We also ﬁnd that when comparing across markets
at the same capacity tier, in addition to having higher link
utilization, users in more expensive markets also tended to
have a higher total demand.
6. COST OF INCREASING CAPACITY
Subscribers select broadband service based on their needs,
the set of available plans and the plans’ prices. Thus, given
the diversity in service availability across markets, users
with similar needs will end up choosing diﬀerent broadband
services, depending on what is available. In this section, we
look at how the relative cost of alternative services impacts
user demand.
Beyond price, broadband service markets diﬀer in the
relative cost of upgrading services. For example, according
to our dataset of service plans, both Japan and the US
have similar prices of broadband access with a connection
of at least 1 Mbps costs less than $25 per month. The two
markets diﬀer, however, in service availability and the cost
of upgrading. In Japan, a 100 Mbps plan is considerably less
expensive than in the US ($40 per month instead of $115 per
month). Furthermore, in contrast to the US, the broadband
service market in Japan has more options with capacities
above 50 Mbps and fewer ﬁxed-line services below 10 Mbps.
It is clear that the cost of upgrading capacity, similar to
the cost of a particular service level, can have an impact on
a demand users impose on their service. To explore this, we
begin by generalizing the cost of increased capacity. To this
end, we collect all service plans for each country, perform a
linear regression analysis on each market, and measure the
correlation between capacity and price. We ﬁnd that, in the
majority of these markets (66%) there is a strong correlation
(> 0.8) between price and capacity and in 81% there is at
least moderate correlation (> 0.4).
In markets where there is weak or no correlation, price is
often aﬀected by other factors. For example, in Afghanistan,
it is possible to sign up for a dedicated (not shared)
DSL connection that is slower and more expensive than
alternatives,
lowering the correlation coeﬃcient between
price and capacity. Whether or not a service is wireless or
has a monthly traﬃc cap would also aﬀect the relationship
between price and capacity.
For markets where price and capacity are at least mod-
erately correlated (r > 0.4), we use the slope of the linear
regression line to estimate the cost of upgrades (the slope is
measured in monthly price per Mbps increase in capacity).
Figure 10 presents a CDF of the cost of increasing capacity
by 1 Mbps for all markets in our dataset.
For illustration, we note in the ﬁgure where a few
representative markets fall in the distribution. At the lower
end of the curve (less than $0.10 to upgrade), we ﬁnd regions
such as Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. Countries
such as Canada and the US are at slightly above $0.50 per
the monthly cost

comprised of countries in Africa and the Middle East, like
Ghana and Uganda.

Table 5: The percentage of countries in each region
where increasing capacity costs more than $1, $5,
and $10 per month for a 1 Mbps increase in capacity.
We split Asia into two subgroups, developed and
developing, given the diversity of economies within
the area.6
As shown in Fig. 10, increasing capacity by 1 Mbps tends
to cost less than $1 per month in developed countries but
can be well above $100 (PPP) in some developing countries
(e.g., Paraguay and Ivory Coast).7 Table 5 summarizes this
distribution by aggregated region, presenting the percentage
of countries, per region, where the cost of increasing capacity
by 1Mbps is above $1, $5 and %10 (PPP) per month. The
trends are strikingly clear – for 74% of the countries in Africa
and 43% of those in the Middle East, for instance, the costs
of an additional 1Mbps is above $10 per month.
To test for the impact of service upgrade on user demand
we deﬁne a new study. For this experiment, our hypothesis
(H) states that as the cost to upgrade increases, users are
less likely to upgrade and will have higher network demand
than users in markets where upgrading is cheaper. Our

upgrading capacity cost less than $1 per Mbps per month.

will not aﬀect demand. We use the cost of upgrade to split
broadband markets into three classes: countries where the
cost of increasing a service by 1Mbps is (i) below $0.5, (ii)
between $0.5 and $1 and (iii) above $1.00 per Mbps.

Table 6: Percentage of the time that a higher cost
to increase capacity (price per 1 Mbps increase) will
result in higher network usage. An asterisk denotes
that a result was not statistically signiﬁcant.
We present the results of this experiment in Table 6,
for average demand with and without including BitTorrent
traﬃc. In general, increased upgrade prices do lead to higher
demand. It is clear that users in developing countries tend
to use more than similar users where faster service are more
readily accessible. In cases where our results are statistically
signiﬁcant, we can reject the null hypothesis, and assert that
the price of increasing capacity aﬀects demand. Our results
are inconclusive, i.e., p-value slightly higher than 0.05 when
comparing demand (without BitTorrent) between markets
where the cost of upgrade are ($0, $0.50] and ($0.50, $1.00].
We have already visited an example of the impact that
the cost of increasing capacity can have on (Figs. 8 and 9).
While both Japan and the US have similar monthly cost of
broadband access, the costs of increasing capacity is over
ﬁve times higher in the US explaining the observed higher
demand in the US.
7. CONNECTION QUALITY
Previous works have shown that poor connection quality
can have a negative impact on a user’s quality of expe-
rience [13].
In this last section, we explore the potential
impact that the quality of a connection, speciﬁcally latency
and packet loss, has on user demand.
We hypothesize that a suﬃciently poor quality of experi-
ence could lead to a decrease in demand on the broadband
service.
In the following paragraphs we test whether this
is true by studying the impact of both long latencies
and high packet loss rates. As we have done in our
previous comparisons, we study the eﬀects of these factors
by comparing users that are similar in terms of link capacity
and location. When testing the eﬀects of increased latency,
we require that average packet loss rates are similar between
matched users and vice versa.
7.1 Latency
We ﬁrst look at the impact of latency on user behavior.
In this case, our hypothesis (H) is that decreasing latency
will result in higher demand. Therefore, our null hypothesis
Table 7: Percentage of the time that decreasing
latency will result in higher 95th percentile usage
(without BitTorrent). Very high latency (over
512 ms) to the nearest NDT server appears to result
in lower demand than comparable users with lower
latencies.
Figure 11: CDF of latency measurements for users
in our dataset, grouped by location (India versus
the rest of our sample population, labelled “Other”).
“Web” represents each user’s median latency to ﬁve
of Alexa’s Top Sites from our 2014 dataset. “NDT”
represents the average latency to the nearest NDT
server. We include NDT data from 2014 that was
collected from the same set of users as the web 2014
data.
(H0) is that decreasing latency does not aﬀect demand and
the interaction will be random.
We present the results of the study in Table 7. The table
compares the peak demand (95th percentile usage when
BitTorrent is not active) of users with problematically high
latencies, above 512 ms in our dataset. Users are divided
among exponentially increasing sized bins; our control and
treatment groups in this case are the higher and lower
latency groups, respectively. The results show that there
is a signiﬁcant increase in usage when switching from very
high latency to any lower latency group, leading us to reject
the null hypothesis.
While the case of latency impacting demand is visible
in multiple countries, the impact of high-latency is clear
when focusing on users in India. In our previous analysis
broadband service plans, we ﬁnd that the cost to increase
capacity is similar in both the US and India (both are
within 25% of each other). The cost of broadband access,
however, is much higher in India ($67 versus $20). Thus, we
would expect usage to be higher in India. When comparing
