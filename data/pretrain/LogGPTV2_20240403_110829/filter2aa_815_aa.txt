When Good SCADA Goes SERIOUSLY WRONG
 “About 3:28 p.m., Pacific daylight time, on June 10, 1999, a 16-
inch-diameter steel pipeline owned by Olympic Pipe Line
Company ruptured and released about 237,000 gallons of
gasoline into a creek that flowed through Whatcom Falls Park in
Bellingham, Washington. About 1.5 hours after the rupture, the
gasoline ignited and burned approximately 1.5 miles along the
creek. Two 10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old young man
died as a result of the accident. Eight additional injuries were
documented. A single-family residence and the city of
Bellingham's water treatment plant were severely damaged. As
of January 2002, Olympic estimated that total property
damages were at least $45 million.”

This was an accident
 “The Olympic Pipeline SCADA system consisted of Teledyne
Brown Engineering SCADA Vector software, version 3.6.1.,
running on two Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX Model
4000-300 computers with VMS operating system Version 7.1. In
addition to the two main SCADA computers (OLY01 and 02), a
similarly configured DEC Alpha 300 computer running
Alpha/VMS was used as a host for the separate Modisette
Associates, Inc., pipeline leak detection system software
package.”

Digruntled Employee
 Vitek Boden, in 2000, was arrested, convicted and jailed
because he released millions of liters of untreated sewage using
his wireless laptop. It happened in Maroochy Shire, Queensland,
as revenge against his a former employer.

Digruntled Employee
 "Marine life died, the creek water turned black and the stench was
unbearable for residents," said Janelle Bryant of the Australian
Environmental Protection Agency.
The Maroochydore District Court heard that 49-year-old Vitek Boden
had conducted a series of electronic attacks on the Maroochy Shire
sewage control system after a job application he had made was
rejected by the area's Council. At the time he was employed by the
company that had installed the system. Boden made at least 46
attempts to take control of the sewage system during March and April
2000.
On 23 April, the date of Boden's last hacking attempt, police who
pulled over his car found radio and computer equipment.
Later investigations found Boden's laptop had been used at the time of
the attacks and his hard drive contained software for accessing and
controlling the sewage management system.

Worm Attack
“In August 2003 Slammer infected a private computer network
at the idled Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in Oak Harbor,
Ohio, disabling a safety monitoring system for nearly five hours.”

Worm Attack
“The Slammer worm entered the Davis-Besse plant through a
circuitous route. It began by penetrating the unsecured network
of an unnamed Davis-Besse contractor, then squirmed through
a T1 line bridging that network and Davis-Besse's corporate
network. The T1 line, investigators later found, was one of
multiple ingresses into Davis-Besse's business network that
completely bypassed the plant's firewall, which was
programmed to block the port Slammer used to spread.”

Sabotage
 Thomas C. Reed, Ronald Regan’s Secretary, described in his
book “At the abyss” how the U.S. arranged for the Soviets to
receive intentionally flawed SCADA software to manage their
natural gas pipelines. "The pipeline software that was to run the
pumps, turbines, and values was programmed to go haywire,
after a decent interval, to reset pump speeds and valve settings
to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to pipeline
joints and welds." A 3 kiloton explosion was the result, in 1982
in Siberia.

Other incidents
 In 1992, a former Chevron employee disabled it’s emergency
alert system in 22 states.  This wasn’t discovered until an
emergency did not raise the appropriate alarms
 In 1997, a teenager broke into NYNEX and cut off Worcester
Airport in Massachusetts for 6 hours by affecting ground and air
communications
 In 2000 the Russian government announced that hackers had
managed to control the world’s largest natural gas pipeline
(Gazprom)
 In 2003, the east coast of America experienced a blackout.
While the Blaster worm was not the cause, many related
systems were found to be infected
 Computers and manuals seized in Al Qaeda (allegedly) training
camps were full of SCADA information related to dams and
other such structures

Other incidents – real or otherwise
 "We have information, from multiple regions outside the United
States, of cyber intrusions into utilities, followed by extortion
demands. We suspect, but cannot confirm, that some of these
attackers had the benefit of inside knowledge. We have
information that cyber attacks have been used to disrupt power
equipment in several regions outside the United States. In at
least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting
multiple cities. We do not know who executed these attacks or
why, but all involved intrusions through the Internet.“

Other incidents – real or otherwise
 "Computer hackers in China, including those working on behalf
of the Chinese government and military, have penetrated
deeply into the information systems of U.S. companies and
government agencies, stolen proprietary information from
American executives in advance of their business meetings in
China, and, in a few cases, gained access to electric power
plants in the United States, possibly triggering two recent and
widespread blackouts in Florida and the Northeast, according to
U.S. government officials and computer-security experts.“

 "This time, though, they've attached their tale to the most
thoroughly investigated power incident in U.S. history." and "It
traced the root cause of the outage to the utility company
FirstEnergy's failure to trim back trees encroaching on high-
voltage power lines in Ohio. When the power lines were
ensnared by the trees, they tripped. [...]
So China...using the most devious malware ever devised,
arranged for trees to grow up into exactly the right power lines
at precisely the right time to trigger the cascade.”

Time for some F.U.D.
Security Risk defined largely by threat
 Massive power blackout
 Oil Refinery explosion
 Waste mixed in with drinking water
 Dam opens causing flooding
 Traffic Chaos
 Nuclear Explosion?

Remember this?

Time for some F.U.D.
Risk is worse these days because hacking is EASY!
 Hacking used to involve skilled attackers performing simple
attacks (password guessing, brute forcing etc)
 Now with the rise of easily available hacking tools, complex
attacks can be carried out by relatively unskilled attackers…

Where’s my digital armageddon???
 Let’s watch a video then we’ll have a couple of case studies
© 2007 Security-Assessment.com
O.K. too much FUD
The digital Armageddon hasn’t happened yet
 Stories are obviously exaggerated to stir up outrage
 Blaster did not cause the east coast power outage
 Stories of “teenaged hackers” are frequently exaggerated
 Chinese hackers get blamed for everything from missing
beer to lost homework…
Dire predictions have thus far been incorrect.
 IDC named 2003 “the year of cyber-terrorism”, predicting that a
major cyber-terrorism event would bring the internet to its
knees.

SCADA Basics
So what is it actually?
 A SCADA  system consists of central host that monitors and
controls smaller Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) sprinkled
throughout a plant, or in the field at key points in an electrical
distribution network. The RTUs, in turn, directly monitor and
control various pieces of equipment.

SCADA Basics
Components of a SCADA network – Edge Devices
RTU / PLC – Reads information on voltage, flow, the status of
switches or valves.  Controls pumps, switches, valves.
Most site control is performed by these devices automatically
Data acquisition begins at the RTU or PLC level and includes
meter readings, equipment reports etc
Functionality is usually restricted to basic site overriding or
supervisory level intervention
E.g. A PLC may control the flow of water through, but the
SCADA system will allow an operator to set alarm
conditions, change the set points for the flow etc etc

SCADA Basics
Components of A SCADA Network – Intermediate Layer
 The “Master Station” is the servers and software responsible for
communicating with the field equipment and then to the HMI
software generally running on workstations
 Data is sent from (RTU) PLCs to a Master Station where it is
compiled in a way that a control room operator using the HMI
can make supervisory decisions to adjust or override normal
