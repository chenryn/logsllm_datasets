## Introduction
### About Me
Hi, my name is Morgan. I'm a security expert at Security-Assessment.com, an independent security consultancy. Our team, the largest and most experienced in New Zealand, specializes in securing large, critical networks for banks, airlines, government agencies, telecommunications, and utility companies. We are paid to think like hackers and break things, just as they would.

### What is SCADA?
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are often used interchangeably with industrial control systems (ICS) in media. These systems manage and control various processes, including:
- Water supply and treatment plants
- Electrical power distribution and transmission
- Chemical and nuclear power plants
- HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning)
- Traffic signals
- Mass transit systems
- And more

## History and Real-World Examples
### Accidents and Incidents
1. **Olympic Pipeline Rupture (June 10, 1999)**
   - A 16-inch-diameter steel pipeline ruptured, releasing about 237,000 gallons of gasoline into a creek. The subsequent fire killed three people and caused over $45 million in damages.
   - The SCADA system involved was Teledyne Brown Engineering SCADA Vector software running on DEC VAX Model 4000-300 computers.

2. **Maroochy Shire Sewage Attack (2000)**
   - Vitek Boden, a disgruntled ex-employee, used his wireless laptop to release millions of liters of untreated sewage, causing environmental damage and public health issues.

3. **Slammer Worm (August 2003)**
   - The Slammer worm infected the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant, disabling a safety monitoring system for nearly five hours. It entered through an unsecured contractor's network and bypassed the plant's firewall.

4. **Soviet Pipeline Sabotage (1982)**
   - Thomas C. Reed, former Secretary under Ronald Reagan, described how the U.S. provided flawed SCADA software to the Soviets, leading to a 3-kiloton explosion in Siberia.

### Other Notable Incidents
- **Chevron Emergency Alert System (1992)**: A former employee disabled the emergency alert system in 22 states.
- **NYNEX Hack (1997)**: A teenager cut off communications at Worcester Airport for six hours.
- **Gazprom Hack (2000)**: Russian hackers gained control of the world's largest natural gas pipeline.
- **East Coast Blackout (2003)**: While not directly caused by the Blaster worm, many related systems were found to be infected.
- **Al Qaeda Training Camps**: Computers and manuals seized from Al Qaeda training camps contained SCADA information related to dams and other structures.

### CIA and Media Reports
- **CIA Senior Analyst Tom Donahue (January 2008)**: Reported cyber intrusions into utilities, followed by extortion demands, and disruptions causing power outages.
- **National Journal Magazine (May 31, 2008)**: Claimed Chinese hackers had penetrated U.S. electric power plants, possibly triggering blackouts.
- **Bruce Schneier (June 2, 2008)**: Criticized these claims, calling them "nonsense."
- **Wired (May 29, 2008, Kevin Poulson)**: Debunked the idea that China could have caused the 2003 blackout by manipulating tree growth.

## Risk and Threat Landscape
### Defining Security Risks
- **Massive Power Blackouts**
- **Oil Refinery Explosions**
- **Contamination of Drinking Water**
- **Floods Caused by Dam Failures**
- **Traffic Chaos**
- **Nuclear Explosions**

### Evolving Threats
- **Hacking Has Become Easier**: With the rise of easily available hacking tools, complex attacks can now be carried out by relatively unskilled attackers. Tools like aircrack, nmap, nessus, metasploit, wicrawl, and even purchased 0-day exploits make it easier to conduct sophisticated attacks.

### Exaggerated Fears
- **The Digital Armageddon Hasn't Happened Yet**: Many stories are exaggerated to stir outrage. For example, the Blaster worm did not cause the 2003 east coast power outage, and tales of teenage hackers are often overstated.
- **IDC Prediction (2003)**: IDC named 2003 "the year of cyber-terrorism," predicting a major event that would bring the internet to its knees. This prediction did not come to pass.

## SCADA System Overview
### Components of a SCADA Network
- **Edge Devices (RTU/PLC)**: These devices read information on voltage, flow, switch status, and control pumps, switches, and valves. They perform most site control automatically and send data to the master station.
- **Intermediate Layer (Master Station)**: The servers and software responsible for communicating with field equipment and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) software. The master station compiles data from RTUs/PLCs, allowing operators to make supervisory decisions and adjust or override normal operations.

### Conclusion
While SCADA systems are critical for managing and controlling essential infrastructure, the risks associated with them are real but often exaggerated. Understanding the components and threats is key to securing these systems effectively.
