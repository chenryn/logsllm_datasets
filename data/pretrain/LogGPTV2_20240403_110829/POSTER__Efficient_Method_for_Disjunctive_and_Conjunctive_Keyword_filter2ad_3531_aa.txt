Abstract: Searchable public key encryption supporting conjunctive keywords search (SPE-CKS)
enables data users to retrieve the encrypted data of interest from an untrusted server. Based on
SPE-CKS, one can realize a multi-keywords search over the encrypted e-mails. In this paper, we
propose an efﬁcient SPE-CKS scheme by utilizing a keyword conversion method and the bilinear
map technique. Our scheme is proven to be secure against chosen keyword attack under a standard
security deﬁnition and can also withstand the keywords guessing attack. Furthermore, we design an
experiment over a real world e-mail dataset to illustrate that our scheme has a better performance on
time and space complexities than the previous schemes. A detailed analysis shows that our scheme is
very practical for the encrypted e-mail system in the mobile cloud environment.
Keywords: searchable public key encryption; conjunctive keywords search; searching over encrypted data
1. Introduction
Nowadays, with the rapid development of cloud computing technology, enterprises and
individuals can obtain good e-mail services at lower costs. However, the events of leakage of sensitive
e-mail data from the cloud server have occurred occasionally since e-mail data stored in the server is in
plaintext. How to safely and effectively retrieve e-mail data from the cloud server is one of the concerns
in the e-mail system. A straightforward solution is encrypting e-mails before outsourcing it to the
cloud server. But the traditional encryption schemes disrupt the structure of the original data and then
hinder users querying e-mails stored in the cloud server. To solve this problem, searchable encryption
(SE) [1,2]—which can realize information retrieval over the encrypted data—is regarded as one of
suitable techniques.
SE supporting keyword search can be built in symmetric key setting or public key setting.
In symmetric key setting, authorized users sends encrypted documents and encrypted indexes to a
server and retrieve documents containing certain keywords which they query by using a trapdoor
without loss of data conﬁdentiality. In this setting, the index and the trapdoor are constructed by using
the same secret key. However, if one of the authorized users leaks the secret key, all authorized users’
data will be revealed. Thus, it is impractical in some applications, such as encrypted e-mail system
(EES) [2] and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [3]. For the EES system, there are three roles in an EES
system, that is, data senders, data receiver and service provider. Under this scenario, any data senders
use the searchable public key encryption (SPE) scheme to encrypt e-mails and send these encrypted
e-mails to service provider. After that, data receiver performs a secure query to the e-mail service
provider and the service provider executes query operations over the encrypted e-mails and returns
e-mails associated to this query. The interactive process among these three roles is described in Figure 1.
In this application scenario, the security requirements is summarized as follows: (1) any data senders
can generate the encrypted e-mails; (2) only data receiver can perform data query and decrypt the

encrypted e-mails; (3) anyone except the data receiver cannot obtain the contents of encrypted e-mails.
According to these security requirements, we can ﬁnd that SPE is very suitable for constructing a
secure EES than searchable symmetric key encryption (SSE).

The ﬁrst SPE scheme supporting keyword search was introduced by Boneh et al. [2]. But, this
scheme only supports single keyword search. For supporting multi-keywords search, Part et al. ﬁrst
proposed a SPE supporting conjunctive keywords search scheme [4], which is called the public key
encryption with conjunctive keywords search (PECK). After that, an efﬁcient PECK scheme [5] was
proposed to reduce the time and space cost. Note that these schemes all need keyword ﬁelds as
compulsory information, which is not practical for many applications. For example, if documents
which senders send to the server are scientiﬁc papers, each paper has its keyword list and the keywords
in the list are arranged in the alphabetical order. So, the same keyword might occur in different
positions of the keyword list for different papers. In this situation, schemes with ﬁxed-position
keyword ﬁelds are not suitable for a keywords search. To overcome this problem, Boneh and Waters
introduced a public key encryption scheme called hidden vector encryption (HVE) which can support
conjunctive keyword search without keyword ﬁeld [6]. To achieve a better efﬁciency, a PECK scheme
without keyword ﬁeld was proposed in Reference [7]. In order to achieve advanced keywords search
function, many SPE schemes which can support conjunctive or disjunctive keywords search have
been proposed in recent years [8–10]. For the security concern, in order to withstand the keyword
guessing attack launched by the outsider attacker and the malicious insider, the SPE scheme against
the keyword guessing attack was given in Reference [11].
Our Work. Considering that SPE scheme supporting conjunctive keywords search (SPE-CKS)
without keyword ﬁeld has a good application in many scenarios, especially, for example, encrypted
e-mail system, this paper is to construct an efﬁcient and secure SPE-CKS scheme without the keyword
ﬁeld. More precisely, we make two types of contributions, improving both the efﬁciency and the
security of the recent schemes of SPE-SMKS introduced in References [7,8,10]. These contributions are
listed as follows.
(1) Based on the keyword conversion method introduced in Reference [10], we create a novel
keyword conversion method which can change the index and query keyword set into an attribute
and a predicate vector, respectively. The dimension of vector generated by using our method is

much less than that generated by adopting the previous method. Through applying the existing
technique called bilinear map to encrypt the attribute and predicate vectors, our scheme achieves
a better performance in time and space complexities than the previous schemes.
For security concern, we give a detailed proof to demonstrate that our scheme is secure against
chosen keyword attack. Moreover, inspired by the idea introduced in Reference [11], through
sharing a secret number between the senders and the receiver, our scheme can limit the capability
of index building for adversaries. If the adversaries fail to generate the index, the adversaries
cannot launch the keyword guessing attack. Compared with the previous schemes, our scheme
can both defend against chosen keyword attack and keyword guessing attack.
Besides, we also design a detailed experiment based on a real-world e-mail dataset to show the
advantage of our scheme.
Organization. This paper is organized as follows. Related work is discussed in Section 2.
In Section 3, we deﬁne model of SPE-CKS and security model of SPE-CKS and also introduce some
background related to our work. In Section 4, we introduce the keyword conversion method and the
concrete SPE-CKS scheme. The security proof of our scheme is also given. In Section 5, we analyze the
time and space complexities of our scheme and give a detailed experiment to verify the efﬁciency of
our scheme. This paper concludes in Section 6.
2. Related Work
Searchable encryption supporting keyword search has been researched widely in recent years,
which are grouped into two categories. One is searchable symmetric key encryption (SSE); the other is
searchable public key encryption (SPE).
In symmetric key setting, Song et al. introduced the concept of search over encrypt data and gave
an approach about it [1]. Goh deﬁned the notion of security for searchable encryption and presented
an effective scheme by using Bloom ﬁlter [12]. However, these works only provide a single keyword
search. The concept of conjunctive keyword search on encrypted data in symmetric key setting was
ﬁrst proposed by Golle et al. [13]. In their paper, they also gave two constructions which are based
on this concept. In comparing with Golle’s work, subsequent works [14,15] were trying to construct
schemes which had much better performance in computational and communication cost. Considering
that the practical scheme requires supporting multi-keyword search and returning the top-k search
results, Cao et al. [16] constructed a multi-keyword rank search scheme over encrypted cloud data.
After that, many SSE schemes supporting rank search were given in References [17,18], which achieve
a better search performance.
In public key setting, Boneh et al. deﬁned the concept of public key encryption with keyword
search and gave one construction of importance which were related to the Identity-Based Encryption
scheme proposed by Boneh and Frannklin [19]. Abdalla et al. deﬁned the computational and statistical
notion of PEKS and presented a new scheme that is statistically consistent [20]. However, their works
only support a single keyword search in public key setting. The concept and security model of
conjunctive keyword search over encrypted data in public key system were proposed in Reference [4] in
which they also gave two PECK schemes. The ﬁrst scheme needs lots of bilinear pairing computations
and the second scheme needs private keys in proportion to the number of keywords. Then, Hwang and
Lee designed a more efﬁcient scheme on time and space complexities than the previous works and
introduced a new concept called a multi-user PECK scheme which can effectively manage the encrypted
documents in a server for a group of users [5]. The above PECK schemes all use keyword ﬁelds as an
addition of information. In order to eliminate the keyword ﬁeld, Boneh and Waters proposed a public
key system that supports comparison queries(such as x ≥ a) and conjunctive keywords queries [6].
To achieve a better performance on time and space complexities, Zhang and Zhang addressed this
issue and proposed a more efﬁcient PECK scheme without using keyword ﬁeld [7]. For supporting
disjunctions and polynomial equations, Katz et al. proposed a predicate encryption supporting inner
product scheme (IPE) [21]. In their work, they also give a method for applying IPE scheme to realize

conjunctive or disjunctive keywords search. To achieve a fully secure level, fully secure IPE scheme
was proposed by Lewko et al. in Reference [22]. After this, an IPE scheme with less time and space
cost was introduced in Reference [8]. In the past of few years, numerous efforts have been devoted
to constructing a SPE scheme with advanced keywords search. Wang et al. described a new SPE
scheme to support range search [23]. Zhang et al. achieved disjunctive and conjunctive keywords
search over encrypted data [9,10]. Zhu et al. proposed a SPE scheme supporting fuzzy keyword
search [24]. Byun et al. [15] ﬁrstly deﬁned ofﬂine keyword guessing attack and showed that SPE
schemes are insecure against keyword guessing attack. Jeong et al. [25] pointed that the consistency
implies insecurity of a PEKS scheme against keyword guessing attack. Addressing this problem, two
works [26,27] were constructed to defeat the ofﬂine keyword guessing attack. The ﬁrst work using
the method of registered keyword was given by Tang and Chen [27]. The second work given by
Hyun et al. [26] can defeat keyword guessing attack since only the designated server can test which
index is related with a given trapdoor by using the server’s private key. However, their schemes only
against ofﬂine keyword guessing attacks by outsider attackers. After that, based on the scheme [28],
Lu et al. proposed a SPE scheme which is secure against KG attacks by either outsider attackers or
malicious insider servers [11].
3. Preliminaries
In this section, we give the model and security deﬁnition of SPE-CKS. In addition, we will
including the bilinear map and the
brieﬂy introduce some tools adopted in our scheme,
complexity assumptions.
3.1. Model of Spe-Cks
In SPE-CKS, there are three roles: e-mail sender, receiver and service provider (server). Let pkR
and skR be e-mail receiver’s public key and secret key and pkS and skS be e-mail senders’ public key
and secret key. An e-mail sender can send an encrypted e-mail M to a server with an encrypted index
generated by using the keywords w1, w2, . . . , wn of M and the keys pkR, pkS, skS. When an e-mail
receiver wants to query e-mails with keywords q1, q2, . . . , qm where m ≤ n, the receiver generates a
trapdoor by using these keywords and the keys pkR, pkS, skR and then sends this trapdoor to the e-mail
service provider. When the server receives the trapdoor, the server tests each secure index against the
trapdoor and returns the matched e-mails to the receiver. From the above, we give the deﬁnition of the
SPE-CKS model, which is regared as a variant of PECK model proposed in Reference [4].
Deﬁnition 1. SPE-CKS consists of 5 probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) algorithms: KeyGenR, KeyGenS,
IndexBuild, Trapdoor, Test. There are:

KeyGenR(1n): Given a security parameter 1n, the algorithm is executed by the receiver and generates the a
pair of key (pkR, skR), where pkR and skR are the public and private key for the receiver, respectively.
KeyGenS(1n): This is a key generation algorithm for the data sender. The algorithm creates a pair of key
(pkS, skS), where pkS and skS are the public and private key for the sender, respectively.
IndexBuild(pkS, skS, pkR, W): The algorithm is executed by the sender to encrypt a keyword set
W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn} without keyword ﬁeld.
It produces a searchable index IW of W by using
the keys pkS, skS and pkR.
Trapdoor(pkR, skR, pkS, Q): The algorithm is executed by the receiver to construct a trapdoor. Given the
keys pkR, skR, pkS and the keyword query Q = {q1, q2, . . . , qm} where m ≤ n, the algorithm generates a
trapdoor TQ.
Test(pkR, pkS, TQ, IW): The algorithm is executed by the server to test the trapdoor TQ whether matches
the index IW or not. It takes a trapdoor TQ, a secure index IW and the public keys pkS, pkR as input,
then outputs 1 if Q ⊆ W or 0 otherwise.

Correctness of SPE-CKS. Let W and Q be two keywords sets. (pkR, skR), (pkS, skS), IW and TQ
are generated correctly by algorithms KeyGenR(1n), KeyGenS(1n), IndexBuild(pkS, skS, pkR, W) and
Trapdoor(pkR, skR, pkS, Q), respectively. If Q ⊆ W, the Test(pkR, pkS, TQ, IW) outputs 1. Otherwise, it
outputs 1 with negligible probability.
3.2. Security Deﬁnition of Spe-Cks
To prove the security of the SPE-CKS scheme, we introduce a security game called
indistinguishability of ciphertext from random against chosen keyword attacks (IND-CR-CKA) deﬁned
by Hwang and Lee [5]. IND-CR-CKA is a variant of security game called indistinguishability of
ciphertext from ciphertext (ICC) deﬁned by Golle et al. [13] for a symmetric key system. The essential
of IND-CR-CKA of SPE-CKS is that the scheme should ensure that the encrypted indices of two
challenge keyword sets cannot be distinguished by any adversaries.
