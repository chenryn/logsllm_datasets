User: I have installed Anaconda on Sublime Text 3 and this error pops up each time 
whenever I try to build a file:
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
If it involves adding the python to the path file(on windows), could please explain exactly what I need to add. 
I use Windows 7 Ultimate, Python 3.6.0
Assistant: You have to add Python to the Environmental Variables.
