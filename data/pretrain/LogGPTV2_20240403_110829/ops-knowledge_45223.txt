User: Can you make a universal python application that will run on both OSX and Windows? With the same menu system, etc? Or would you need to make different versions for each OS?
Assistant: I'm currently developing an app on my Ubuntu Linux machine. I real life it runs on a windows xp machine with touchpad.
I'm using wxPython as the gui toolkit. In the past I've used .net predominantly but I wanted cross platform.
It really runs without any checks about which os it is running on. (save one check where i read a textfile and i have some trouble with the line endings)
