User: I'm editing a file in ~/Documents. However, my working directory is somewhere else, say ~/Desktop.
The file I'm editing is a Python script. I'm interested in doing a command like...
:!python 
without needing to do
:!python ~/Documents/script.py
Is that possible? If so, what would be the command?
Thank you.
Assistant: Try: !python %
