disproportionate number of bidders to 10260’s auctions; with ship-
ping costs included, the auctions still ended with purchase prices
comparable to market value.
3.3 From Bidding Behavior to Reputation
Using the three models, we identify the auctioning reputation of
each seller as a 3-tuple of anomaly scores. Table 1 provides our
proposed interpretation for various outcomes of our system. An
abnormal value for N , M, or P indicates a high number of bids,
that the seller has a large number of bids not explained by a low
minimum-starting bid, or that certain bidders repeatedly lose in this
seller’s auctions, respectively. Although this table shows boolean
values for simplicity, Section 4.5 explains that our system actually
assigns numeric anomaly scores that describe our conﬁdence in the
normality or anomalousness of a seller.
10260 is abnormal with respect to all three of our models. This
is the strongest evidence we can provide for price inﬂation. There
are cases in which one of the models classiﬁes a seller as normal

Table 1: Interpretation of model anomalies. N , M, and P de-
note the models in the auctioning reputation. An “A” indicates
that a seller’s score for a model is anomalous, while an “N” in-
dicates that the score is normal. In practice, numeric values
express conﬁdence in the anomalousness of a score (see Sec-
tion 4.5).
while another model classiﬁes him as abnormal. For example, there
are sellers who have a high number of bids that can be explained
by the minimum-starting bid model, but at the same time, have an
abnormal set of repeating bidders. In such cases, we say that our
reputation system provides weak evidence of shilling. Comparing
cases of weak evidence and determining the level of weakness is
beyond the scope of this paper.
4. FORMALIZING REPUTATION
We formalize the intuitive process presented in Section 3.2 to
enable the automation of our reputation system. This sections pre-
cisely deﬁnes the concepts “normal behavior” and “abnormal be-
havior”. We ﬁrst collected auction data from eBay and then an-
alyzed the data according to our three models (Section 3.1).
In
each model, we divided the seller population into a normal set that
contained 95% of the sellers and an abnormal set containing the
remaining 5% using a conﬁdence interval with a coverage proba-
bility of 95% [26]. We deﬁne a seller as abnormal with respect to
a particular model if he falls outside the conﬁdence interval of the
model.
4.1 eBay Data
During a period of three weeks in March 2005, we collected
data from eBay auctions that were listed in the Laptop Parts &
Accessories category.
For each auction, we collected the following data: the seller’s
username, the seller’s reputation according to eBay, and the bids
that were placed. For each bid, we recorded its amount, the time
it was placed, and the bidder’s username.
In total, we collected
145,342 auctions.
Before we analyzed the auctions according to our models, we ﬁl-
tered out uninteresting auctions. An eBay auction can end in three
different ways. First, an auction can end using the Buy-It-Now op-
tion: a bidder buys the item by paying a predetermined price. This
can happen even if the auction has already started and other bid-
ders have already placed their bids. Second, an auction might end
when the seller decides to accept the current highest bid and ter-
minate the auction. Last, an auction might end when its allocated
time has passed. In this case, the highest bid is the winning bid.
We are interested in this ﬁnal category because, with 127,815 auc-
tions, it forms the majority of the data collected and because price
inﬂation can occur when auctions end in this manner. eBay enables
auctions that last one, three, ﬁve, seven, or ten days. Since the du-
ration of an auction affects the number of bids in the auction, it is

(b) Market share of sellers. The total number of sellers in the

inaccurate to compare the number of bids in auctions of different
durations. Therefore, we learned behavioral models based on the
data from 62,542 seven-day auctions which covered almost 50% of
all auctions (Figure 1a).
We observe that the market is dominated by high-volume sell-
ers. Figure 1b presents the accumulated market share of sellers.
In the seven-day category, 5% of the sellers controlled 60% of the
market. Consequently, we restricted our attention to high-volume
sellers, deﬁned as the top 5% in terms of number of auctions posted.
While the total number of sellers in the seven-day auction category
is 12,331, only 604 are high-volume sellers who posted 37,525
auctions. During our three-week experiment, each high-volume
seller posted at least 14 auctions.
4.2 Average Number of Bids Model (N)
We now deﬁne normal and abnormal sellers with respect to the
N model.
Figure 2a presents the distribution of high-volume sellers with
respect to their average number of bids. The x-axis in the ﬁgure
accumulates averages in the ranges [0, 0.5), [0.5, 1), and so on.
Ninety-ﬁve percent of the high-volume sellers have, on average,
fewer than seven bids per auction. While this data alone sufﬁces
to deﬁne normal and abnormal sellers, we noticed that the aver-
age number of bids is statistically correlated (p-value smaller than
0.05 [26]) inversely to the total number of auctions posted by a
seller: sellers who post more auctions receive fewer bids in their
auctions (Figure 2b). Given this correlation, we use Figure 2b as
the basis for deﬁning a seller as normal (or abnormal) with respect
to the N model. Figure 2b suggests that an abnormal seller is a
seller with a large number of bids and a large number of auctions.
We formally deﬁne this property using quantile regression [5, 17].
This method splits the plane of Figure 2b into two half-planes. The
ﬁrst half-plane contains 95% of the sellers whose behavior we de-
ﬁne as normal. The second half-plane contains 5% of the sellers
who have both a large number of auctions, and a high average num-
ber of bids in their auctions. We deﬁne the latter group of sellers as
abnormal. For the results reported in this paper, we split the plane
with a piecewise linear function called the normal line of N .
4.3 Average Minimum Starting Bid Model (M)
Sellers not adopting fraudulent tactics, such as shilling, may also
be classiﬁed as abnormal with respect to the N model. Legitimate
bidder behavior, such as ﬁerce competition on a high-demand item
posted with a low minimum starting bid, can explain a high aver-
age number of bids. As a result, an honest seller who places an
item on sale at a low starting price may be identiﬁed as anoma-
lous with respect to the N model. The average minimum starting
bid model (M) is designed to help differentiate between legitimate
and fraudulent behaviors producing an anomalous N score.
The goal of the M model is to predict the average number of
bids in the seller’s auctions given the average minimum starting
bid set by the seller. To obtain a fair comparison between the min-
imum bids imposed by sellers who sell different items, we deﬁne
the relative minimum starting bid (RMB) for each auction:

Figure 3: The M model: correlation between average number

RMB =
winning bid − minimum starting bid
winning bid
On average, the winning bid of an auction represents the item’s
market value [15]. Thus RMB, which is related to the ratio be-
tween the minimum starting bid and the winning bid, represents
how cheaply the item started off, as compared to its market value;
an RMB close to one indicates a low minimum starting bid. We de-
ﬁne the seller’s average minimum starting bid as the average RMB
in the seller’s auctions. Intuitively, we expect more bidders to par-
ticipate in auctions of sellers whose average minimum starting bid
is high.
Figure 3 conﬁrms our intuition. It shows a strong positive cor-
relation (p-value less than 0.02 [26]) between the seller’s average
minimum starting bid and average number of bids. We deﬁne the
