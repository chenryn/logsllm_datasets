### Disproportionate Number of Bidders and Market Value
Seller 10260's auctions attracted a disproportionately high number of bidders. Even when shipping costs were included, the final purchase prices remained comparable to the market value.

### From Bidding Behavior to Reputation
Using our three models, we identify each seller’s auctioning reputation as a 3-tuple of anomaly scores. Table 1 provides an interpretation of various outcomes from our system. An abnormal value for N, M, or P indicates a high number of bids, a large number of bids not explained by a low minimum starting bid, or repeated losses by certain bidders in the seller’s auctions, respectively. Although the table shows boolean values for simplicity, Section 4.5 explains that our system assigns numeric anomaly scores to describe the confidence in the normality or anomalousness of a seller.

**Table 1: Interpretation of Model Anomalies**
| N | M | P | Evidence for Price Inflation |
|---|---|---|-----------------------------|
| A | A | A | Strongest (e.g., seller 10260) |
| A | N | N | Weak: Unexplained high number of bids |
| A | N | A | Weak: Potential shilling |
| N | N | N | No evidence |
| N | A | A | Weak: Potential shilling |
| N | N | A | Weak: Potential shilling |
| N | A | N | No evidence |
| A | A | N | Weak: Potential shilling |

Seller 10260 is abnormal with respect to all three models, providing the strongest evidence for price inflation. There are cases where one model classifies a seller as normal while another classifies them as abnormal. For example, a seller may have a high number of bids explained by the minimum starting bid model but also an abnormal set of repeating bidders. In such cases, our reputation system provides weak evidence of shilling. Comparing cases of weak evidence and determining the level of weakness is beyond the scope of this paper.

### Formalizing Reputation
We formalize the intuitive process presented in Section 3.2 to enable the automation of our reputation system. This section precisely defines "normal behavior" and "abnormal behavior." We first collected auction data from eBay and then analyzed the data according to our three models (Section 3.1). In each model, we divided the seller population into a normal set containing 95% of the sellers and an abnormal set containing the remaining 5%, using a confidence interval with a coverage probability of 95% [26]. A seller is defined as abnormal with respect to a particular model if they fall outside the confidence interval of that model.

#### 4.1 eBay Data
During a three-week period in March 2005, we collected data from eBay auctions listed in the Laptop Parts & Accessories category. For each auction, we recorded the seller’s username, their eBay reputation, and the bids placed. For each bid, we noted the amount, the time it was placed, and the bidder’s username. In total, we collected 145,342 auctions.

Before analyzing the auctions, we filtered out uninteresting ones. An eBay auction can end in three ways:
1. **Buy-It-Now Option:** A bidder buys the item by paying a predetermined price.
2. **Seller Acceptance:** The seller accepts the current highest bid and terminates the auction.
3. **Time Expiration:** The auction ends after its allocated time, and the highest bid wins.

We focused on the third category, which forms the majority of the data (127,815 auctions), as price inflation can occur here. eBay allows auctions lasting one, three, five, seven, or ten days. Since the duration affects the number of bids, we learned behavioral models based on the data from 62,542 seven-day auctions, which covered almost 50% of all auctions (Figure 1a).

We observed that the market is dominated by high-volume sellers. Figure 1b shows the accumulated market share of sellers. In the seven-day category, 5% of the sellers controlled 60% of the market. Therefore, we restricted our attention to high-volume sellers, defined as the top 5% in terms of the number of auctions posted. While the total number of sellers in the seven-day auction category is 12,331, only 604 are high-volume sellers who posted 37,525 auctions. During our three-week experiment, each high-volume seller posted at least 14 auctions.

#### 4.2 Average Number of Bids Model (N)
We now define normal and abnormal sellers with respect to the N model. Figure 2a presents the distribution of high-volume sellers based on their average number of bids. The x-axis accumulates averages in the ranges [0, 0.5), [0.5, 1), and so on. Ninety-five percent of the high-volume sellers have, on average, fewer than seven bids per auction. We noticed a statistical correlation (p-value < 0.05 [26]) between the average number of bids and the total number of auctions posted: sellers who post more auctions receive fewer bids (Figure 2b).

Given this correlation, we use Figure 2b to define a seller as normal or abnormal with respect to the N model. An abnormal seller has both a large number of auctions and a high average number of bids. We formally define this property using quantile regression [5, 17], which splits the plane into two half-planes. The first half-plane contains 95% of the sellers whose behavior we define as normal. The second half-plane contains 5% of the sellers with both a large number of auctions and a high average number of bids, defined as abnormal. For the results reported in this paper, we split the plane with a piecewise linear function called the normal line of N.

#### 4.3 Average Minimum Starting Bid Model (M)
Sellers not adopting fraudulent tactics, such as shilling, may still be classified as abnormal with respect to the N model. Legitimate bidder behavior, such as fierce competition on a high-demand item with a low minimum starting bid, can explain a high average number of bids. Thus, an honest seller who sets a low starting price may be identified as anomalous with respect to the N model. The average minimum starting bid model (M) helps differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent behaviors producing an anomalous N score.

The goal of the M model is to predict the average number of bids in the seller’s auctions given the average minimum starting bid. To compare minimum bids fairly across different items, we define the relative minimum starting bid (RMB) for each auction:

\[ \text{RMB} = \frac{\text{winning bid} - \text{minimum starting bid}}{\text{winning bid}} \]

On average, the winning bid represents the item’s market value [15]. Thus, RMB, related to the ratio between the minimum starting bid and the winning bid, indicates how cheaply the item started compared to its market value. An RMB close to one indicates a low minimum starting bid. We define the seller’s average minimum starting bid as the average RMB in the seller’s auctions. Intuitively, more bidders are expected to participate in auctions with a high average minimum starting bid.

Figure 3 confirms our intuition, showing a strong positive correlation (p-value < 0.02 [26]) between the seller’s average minimum starting bid and the average number of bids. We define the normal and abnormal regions using a polynomial fit and a normal line (Figure 3).
