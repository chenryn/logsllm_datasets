User: How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?
I'm trying to look for the source of the datetime module in particular, but I'm interested in a more general answer as well.
Assistant: If you're using pip to install your modules, just pip show $module the location is returned.
