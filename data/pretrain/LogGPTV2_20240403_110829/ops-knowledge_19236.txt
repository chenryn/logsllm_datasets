User: How to Locate and Repair Network Faults on Linux System?
Assistant: To locate and repair network faults on the Linux system, you can follow the steps below: 1. Confirm whether the network hardware connection is normal. Check whether the network cable is plugged in properly and whether the network card is working normally. 2. Check whether the network address configuration is correct. Use the ifconfig command to check whether the network card is correctly configured with parameters such as IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. 3. Check whether the DNS configuration is correct. You can use the dig or nslookup command to test whether the DNS resolution is normal. 4. Check whether the network service is normal. Use the ping command to test whether the target address can be pinged. If the ping fails, the target host or service may be unavailable. If you can ping, you can consider other problems. 5. Check whether the routing table configuration is correct. Run the netstat -rn command to view the routing table to confirm whether correct routing information exists. 6. Check whether the firewall is set correctly. You can use the iptables command to view and modify firewall rules. 7. Use the tcpdump command to capture packets, or use the traceroute or mtr commands to trace the path of network packets to find out where network faults lie. 8. If the above steps cannot solve the problem, other network analysis tools can be used for diagnosis and repair, such as Wireshark, tcpdump, etc. In short, to solve network faults, it is necessary to analyze and deal with specific situations, and adopt different methods to solve them according to different fault situations.
