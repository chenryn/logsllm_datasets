1 Introduction
Quality metrics in software engineering have shown their potential as guidance
to improve software designs and make them more understandable and easier to
maintain.Sincebusinessprocessandsoftwareprogramdesignshavealotincom-
mon [7,9], the adaptation of quality metrics to the business process design area
seems worthwhile. Several researchers already identified the potential for these
business process metrics [1,4,5]. We adopted a classification of quality metrics
into five categories from software engineering [2,8]: (i) coupling, (ii) cohesion,
(iii) complexity, (iv) modularity, and (v) size. Together with cohesion, coupling
is considered to be the most important metric [8]. In this paper we present a
coupling metric for business process models.
2 A weighted coupling metric
Thedefinitionweuseforcouplingistakenfromthedefinitionsfoundinthesoft-
ware engineering area [2,3]: Coupling measures the number of interconnections
between the activities in a process model. The degree of coupling depends on
howcomplicated theconnectionsareandalsoonthetypeofconnections between
the activities.
So far, only a small number of researchers have developed coupling metrics for
business processes [6,7]. However, they have not considered the different types
of coupling in business processes, as perhaps seems logical on the basis of the
definition of coupling that is used in the software engineering field. The contri-
bution of this paper is a new coupling metric, based on the existing ones [6,7,9]
42
and inspired by software metrics, which weights different connections between
activities (e.g. AND, OR, XOR). Our coupling metric CP counts all pairs of
activities in a process model that are connected to each other:
(cid:2)
connected(t 1,t 2)
CP = t1,t2∈T
|T|∗(|T|−1)
where connected(t 1,t 2)=
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨1 , i if ( (t t1 → →t A2 N) ∧ D( →t 1 t(cid:5)= 2)t 2 ∧)
1 , f 1 (t 1 (cid:5)=t 2)

1 , f 1 → t 2)
0 , if (t 1 =t 2)
in which t 1 and t 2 are activities, m is the number of ingoing arcs to the connec-
tor, and n is the number of outgoing arcs from the connector.
Each branch between two activities receives a weight according to the type of
connection. This weight is based on the probability that the particular branch
is executed. Because we often do not know about the probabilities for execu-
tion of certain branches in a model at runtime, we assume they are uniformly
distributed. The weights for each branch can then be determined as follows:
– the AND is the strongest binder, because every branch of the AND con-
nector is followed in 100% of the cases. Thus, the probability of following a
particular branch is 1. Figure 1(a) presents a small process model with an
AND-constructor. After A has been executed, always B and C have to be
executed as well. Therefore, the branch from A to B and the branch from A
to C both have a probability of 1 to be followed (and thus a weight of 1).
– theXORistheweakestbinder,becauseinanycaseonlyoneofthebranches
is followed. Thus, the probability of following a particular branch is 1 ,
m·n
where m is the number of ingoing branches and n is the number of outgoing
branches. The process model in Figure 1(c) includes two alternatives: either

followedatthesametime.Becauseofourassumptionthatthetwobranches
have an equal likelihood of being followed, their probability is 1 = 1. And

thus, the weight of each branch in the XOR case of Figure 1(c) is 1.

3 Conclusion
The development of business process metrics to evaluate business processes is
only a recently emerging area of research. In this paper we presented a coupling
metric that deals with the different types of connections that can exist between
theactivitiesinaprocessmodel(e.g.AND,OR,XOR).Webelievethesebusiness
process metrics can help to identify problems in a process model and design
process models that are easy to understand and maintain. Further empirical
work will be necessary to investigate these presumptions.
