The code in `container_bridge.go` (specifically lines 122-143) assumes that the virtual IP addresses for services and pods will be within the `10.x.x.x` range. 

I propose that this assumption should be reconsidered. As discussed in issue #15932, cluster administrators may need to deploy Kubernetes on hosts where the `10.x.x.x` range is reserved for node IP addresses. In such scenarios, Kubelets must support an alternative IP address range to avoid conflicts and ensure proper functionality.

To address this, the code should be modified to allow for a configurable IP range, providing cluster administrators with the flexibility to choose an appropriate range based on their specific network requirements.
