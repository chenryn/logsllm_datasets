https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/container_bridge.go#L122-L143  
container_bridge.go assumes that the virtual IP of services & pods will be in
the `10.` space.  
I propose there is no reason to make this assumption.
As outlined in #15932, cluster admins may need to deploy to hosts in which
`10.` is reserved for the nodes. In such a case, Kubelets must support an
alternative range.
