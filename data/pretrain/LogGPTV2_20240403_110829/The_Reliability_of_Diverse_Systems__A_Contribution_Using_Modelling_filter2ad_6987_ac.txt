e.g.,  from the viewpoint of  average  version  reliability  and

If  we  assume  that  improvements  affect  in  the  same 
proportion  every  possible  fault,  then  increased  gain  is 
always  guaranteed.  This  view  is  popular  and  recently 
argued,  for  instance,  in  [l].  However,  the  assumption

extreme  case  studied,  with  improvements  that  affect  a 
single fault, process improvement may  actually  reduce the 
advantage of fault  tolerance. A  similar  observation on  the 
effect  of  fault  removal  on  the  reliability  gain  given  by 
fault tolerance has been reported in [ 131. 
A  real  process  improvement will  not  match either of 
these two  special  cases.  The  practical  conclusion  is  that 
the gain  from diversity  is  not  a  constant: after measuring 
the  advantage  obtained  given  a  certain  development 
process,  one  cannot  assume  that  fault  tolerance  will 
produce a comparable advantage given a different process. 
5. Bounds on unreliability, under the 
normal approximation 
We  now  discuss  upper  bounds  on 
the  PFD 
(unreliability)  achieved  in  I-version  or  in  I-out-of-2,  2- 
version  systems. We use the  informal  phrase  " x  is  a  99% 
confidence  bound  on  0" to  mean  " P ( 0 I  x)  =  0.99". 
Assessors  usually  avoid  such  formal  statements  about 
software. However,  they  routinely  judge  that  if  certain 
(usually  development  process-related)  evidence  is  given 
about  a software product,  then  the  product  is  suitable  for 
use in a role in  which  it  is  required  to  have  a PFD  lower 
than  a  given  bound.  Such  is  the  spirit,  for  instance,  of 
standards  that  map  reliability  requirements  for  software 
into  "Safety  Integrity  Levels"  (SILs),  and  SILs  into 
recommended  development and V&V practices.  This must 
mean  that  the  assessor  believes  the  evidence  to  imply  a 
certain  confidence or probability  that  the  software  indeed 
satisfies the  reliability  requirements.  It  is  thus  reasonable 
to ask what this assessor should  believe  about a  2-version 
system produced by  the same process. 
5.1.  Gain from diversity 
The normal  distribution  is completely  specified  by  its 
mean  and variance,  as  given  in  the previous  section. The 
inverse  function  of  the  normal  cumulative  distribution 
function  is  widely  available,  and it  is  thus  easy  to  derive 
confidence  statements  in  terms  of  the  mean  p and  the 
standard  deviation  (3  of  the  normal  distribution,  of  the 
form:  "The  probability  of  the  PFD  being  less  than  or 
equal to the required  bound  flR=p+kO is  a". For  instance, 
P(@Sp+30)=0.99865;  we  can  answer  a  question  like 
"What  is  a  value  of  19  such  that  P(@S8)=0.99?"  by 
reading  in  published  tables  that  the  99%  confidence  level 
corresponds to fl=p+2.33 (3. 
We therefore  study  the  value  given  by  our  model  to 
the  expression  (p+ko), where  the  factor  k>O,  chosen 
according to the  required confidence,  appears as a constant 
parameter. Given a required confidence  and thus  a required 
k, it is obviously desirable for the distribution of  the  PFD 
to be such that p+ko  is as small as possible. 
The  first  question  is:  given  a  certain  bound  on  the 
PFD  of  a  single-version  system,  @,,  what  can  we  say 
about a similar bound  (same confidence) for  a  two-version 
system, @,?  This is easily derived. From (4) we obtain: 
~ > + k o 2  S P m o r  P/ + k  J ~ t n a r ( l +  ~ t t i t i x  ) 0, 
(1 1) 
If we do not know the values of p,  and  0, , but  only 
a certain  bound  (p,+kol), we  can  further  manipulate  this 
expression  to derive a slightly looser upper bound: 
~ z + k o ,  
' P m o r   P I   + k  J ~ n i n r ( 1 +   P m t i r )  0, < 
P I   +  k 
JPmmfI  + P,,,,,)  0/= 
P" 
  + k  0)) 
JP,,,,,(1+ 
(12) 
J p m t u ( l +   ~ m m )
I.e.,  given  any  confidence  bound  for  the  PFD  of  a 
one-version  system, the corresponding bound  for the  PFD 
of  a two-version  system  is  smaller  by  at  feast the  ratio 
Jpmcrx(l+pmar). This  assures  us  of  a  small  but 
guaranteed gain from diversity (we must remember that  we 
are talking  about  bounds;  the  actual  gain  may  be  much 
greater, but to know it we would  need to  know  the  values 
of the qi and pi ). Considering these gains for  a few  values 
of p,,,  we find: 
P,"U 
0.5 
0.1 
0.01 
J L x x 2  
0.866 
0.332 
0.100 
The last  line  gives  us  a  IO-fold  improvement,  from 
using diversity, in any  confidence  bound  on  system  PFD: 
being  able  to  trust  such  a  reduction  factor  ("p-factor" 
value)  would  already  be  a  practical  advantage  in  many 
safety assessments. For  even  lower  values  of pmrrr, clearly 
J P m u  (1 + Pmrrx )  &iZ . 
If assessors have estimates of p, and  0, rather than  of 
a  confidence  bound (,u,+k f l 1 ) ,   then  upper  bounds  on 
@,can  be  tighter,  with  greater  advantage  over  a  single- 
version  system;  especially  so,  if  cl is  small  andor 
comparatively low confidence is accepted: the  ratio  reduces 
again  to  pmlrr if  either  0, tends  to  0  (i.e., 
the 
development process is very predictable,  with low  variance 
in  the  reliability  of  its  products)  or  if  we  want  a  50% 
confidence  bound  -  the  median  of  the  distribution,  which 
equals its  mean.  For  instance,  if  we  know  that  pl,=O.O1 
and  0,=0.001,  and we are interested  in  an  84% confidence 
bound  (k=l), this  is  0.01 1  for  one  version;  for  a  two- 
version  system,  even with  P,,,~,.~ as high  as 0.1, our  upper

process  improvement  on  reliability  bounds  under  the 
normal  approximation.  Based  on  numerical  solutions  of

6. Discussion, appropriateness of the 
assumptions 
- (p2+k02)3  we  find 
occurrence,  the  models  assuming  independence  should 
produce predictions  that are not too far from reality. 
If  positive  correlation  is  expected to  be  an  important 
factor, complex models would  be  needed  to  represent  its 
effects.  With  positive  correlation  between  two  mistakes, 
the extreme case  is  that  in  which  the  two  can  only  occur 
together:  then,  they  can  be  considered  as  one  mistake, 
with a resulting failure region which  is the  union  of  those 
associated to  the  two  mistakes.  So,  solving  our  models 
for higher values of the q, parameters  (and correspondingly 
lower  values  of  n )   gives  a  first  approximation  to 
modelling the effects of positive correlation.  Studying the 
sensitivity  of  any  predictions  to  higher  values  of  the  q, 
parameters is a protection  against this  particular  violation 
of the model  assumptions. 
In  conclusion,  the possibility  of  non-zero  correlation 
between  the  presence  of different faults in  a  version  does 
not much reduce the usefulness of our model.

cqi I 1.  Removing  this  artificial  constraint  on 
i=l 
parameter  values  for our models seems  desirable;  but  we 
would  not  know  how  to  substitute  it  and still  be  able to 
solve  the  models.  Usually,  when 
faults  with 
overlapping failure regions  are both  present, the  resulting 
failure region is the union  of  the  two;  but  other cases  are 
possible,  in  which  they  "mask"  each  other  over  some 
subset of this union. Modelling such minute details seems 
useless; the general case of  interest  is  that  if  two  or  more 
faults  are  present,  their  contribution  to  the  PFD  is  not 
necessarily  equal 
individual 
contributions,  but  may  be  less.  In  some  cases,  this 
complication  does  not  cause  serious  problems  with  our 
models,  e.g.,  if  the  probability  of  a  version  containing 
multiple  faults  with  large  overlaps  among  their  failure 
regions is  so  small  that  this  event does not  substantially 
affect the statistics of the PFD. Otherwise,  assuming  non- 
overlapping failure  regions  is  a  pessimistic  assumption, 
usually  well-accepted  when  dealing  with 
safety  and 
reliability. The model  would  assign  non-zero  probability 
to  PFD  values  greater  than  1,  but  these  would  still  be 
much smaller than those  of  reasonable  values  of  PFD,  so 
they  can  be  ignored  without  serious  error.  Pessimistic 
predictions have other drawbacks: we could no  longer trust 
our estimates  of  the  relative  advantage  of  a  two-version 
system  (while still  trusting  the  estimates  of  the  achieved 
PFD as upper bounds for the  actual  achieved PFD);  and if 
used  as  prior  probabilities  for  Bayesian  inference  from 
observed behaviour  of  a  system,  pessimistic  priors  may
