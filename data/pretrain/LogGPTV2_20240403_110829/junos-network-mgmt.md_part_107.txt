#### Log Management and Reporting in Junos OS

**Introduction:**
In environments with a large volume of logs, generating reports can be time-consuming. For example, if there are 5 million logs in a single table generated over the last 10 hours, generating a report may take more than half an hour. Starting from Junos OS Release 19.3R1, the log data is distributed across multiple tables, each containing up to 0.5 million logs. This distribution allows for faster report generation, as only the relevant table(s) need to be queried.

**Database Table Definition:**
- **Session Logs:** Data types include `source-address`, `destination-address`, `application`, and `user`.
- **Security Feature Logs:** Data types include `attack-name`, `URL`, `profile protocol`, and others.
- **Table Design:** Different tables are designed to store different types of logs, which improves performance and optimizes disk space usage. The SRX Series Firewall creates a separate database table for each log type when log data is recorded.
- **Table Capacity:** Each table has a device-specific maximum record number. When this limit is reached, new logs replace the oldest ones. Logs are stored on the SRX Series Firewall where active traffic is processed.

**Multiple Tables in a Database File:**
Starting from Junos OS Release 19.3R1, you can create multiple tables within a database file to store logs. You can define the capacity for each table. If the log count exceeds the table capacity, logs are stored in the next available table. For example:
- If table 1 exceeds its capacity, logs are stored in table 2.
- If the last table in file 1 (table n) exceeds its capacity, logs are stored in table 1 of file 2.

To apply changes immediately after modifying the table number, use the `clear security log report` operational command.

**Database Table Rotation:**
Each table has a maximum record number specific to the device. When this limit is reached, new logs overwrite the oldest ones. The following table outlines the database file size capacity for various devices:

| Device          | Session (G) | Screen (G) | IDP (G) | Content Security (G) | IPsec-VPN (G) | SKY (G) |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|---------|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| SRX300, SRX320, SRX340, SRX345, SRX550M | 1.8 | 0.18 | 0.18 | 0.18 | 0.06 | 0.18 |
| SRX1500         | 12          | 2.25       | 2.25    | 2.25                 | 0.75          | 2.25    |
| SRX4100, SRX4200 | 15          | 2.25       | 2.25    | 2.25                 | 0.75          | 2.25    |
| SRX4600         | 22.5        | 6          | 6       | 6                    | 0.75          | 2.25    |
| vSRX Virtual Firewall | 1.8 | 0.18 | 0.18 | 0.18 | 0.06 | 0.18 |

**Report Generation via CLI:**
Reports can be calculated and displayed using the CLI. When generating a report from multiple tables, the system sorts tables based on timestamps and selects the relevant tables based on the specified start and stop times. For example, if tables 1, 2, and 3 contain logs from time intervals 1-3, 3-5, and 6-8 respectively, and a report is requested from 4 to 6, the system will generate the report from tables 2 and 3.

**Table Lifetime:**
You can configure the table lifetime using the `set security log report table-lifetime` command. Junos OS removes the table when the table's identification time exceeds the configured lifetime. For example, if the table lifetime is set to 2 days and the current date is July 26, 2019, logs from July 24, 2019, 00:00:00, will be removed.

**Dense Mode:**
In Junos OS Release 19.4R1, the default storage and search mechanism in the on-box logging database have been upgraded. You can customize log storage and search mechanisms. If you expect a large number of traffic logs, enable dense mode using the `set security log report table-mode dense` configuration command.

**Chassis Cluster Scenario:**
In a chassis cluster, logs are stored on the local disk of the device processing active traffic and are not synchronized to the peer. In active/passive mode, only the active node stores logs. In failover, the new active node processes and stores logs. In active/active mode, each node processes and stores its own logs.

**Threats Monitoring Report:**
The Threats Report provides general statistics and activity reports of current threats. It includes graphical presentations and detailed information about threat types, sources, destinations, and frequencies. To view the report, navigate to the Threats Report in the J-Web user interface.

**Traffic Monitoring Report:**
The Traffic Report monitors network traffic by reviewing flow sessions over the past 24 hours. It provides connection statistics and session usage by transport protocol. To view the report, select "Monitor > Reports > Traffic" in the J-Web user interface.

**Configuring On-Box Binary Security Log Files:**
SRX Series Firewalls use system and security logs to record control and data plane events. You can configure security logs in binary format for efficient storage and improved CPU utilization. Use the `log` statement at the `[security]` hierarchy level to configure on-box logging. For example:

```shell
[edit security]
user@host# set log mode event
user@host# set log format binary
```

You can also define the log filename, file path, and other characteristics. For example:

```shell
[edit security]
user@host# set log file name security-binary-log
user@host# set log file path security/log-folder
user@host# set log file size 5
user@host# set log file files 5
```

**Additional Notes:**
- Off-box and on-box security logging modes cannot be enabled simultaneously.
- The `show security log file` command displays binary event-mode security log messages, while the `clear security log file` command clears the content of the binary event-mode security log file.
