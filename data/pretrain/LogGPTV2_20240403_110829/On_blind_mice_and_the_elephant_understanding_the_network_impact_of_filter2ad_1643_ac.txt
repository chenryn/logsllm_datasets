While the limitations of the public view of Internet topology are
well known [3], we focus on what this implies for estimating P2P
trafﬁc locality and costs.
To infer traceroute-based AS path information, we combine over
202 M traceroutes between peers in our dataset with data gathered
from public BGP feeds [26] using heuristics from Chen et al. [3].
Altogether, our dataset consists of 13.1 M distinct AS paths.
We then determine the portion of BitTorrent ﬂows that, for
the same time period, can be mapped to an AS path. First we
map each ﬂow’s endpoint IP addresses to a source/destination AS
pair [24]. For each of the resulting 2.1 million AS pairs, we
determine whether an AS-level path exists, using either the paths
in the BGP public view alone or using a combination of the public
view with traceroute-derived AS paths. We say that such a path
exists for a pair if both the source and destination of the pair appear
in any path.
Figure 6 plots the cumulative distribution function of the portion
of BitTorrent trafﬁc per vantage point that can be mapped to an
AS path using either BGP only paths (curve labeled “BGP”) or
the combined set of BGP and traceroute-derived paths (“BGP +
Traceroute”). The ﬁgure shows that paths available in the BGP
public view are not sufﬁcient to account for the majority of ﬂows
in our traces – over 80% of vantage points cannot even map half of
their trafﬁc, while the median vantage point is able to map less than
14% of its trafﬁc.
After adding traceroute-derived AS paths to this analysis, we can
map nearly all BitTorrent trafﬁc to AS paths. In particular, despite
not having complete all-to-all traceroutes, for 90% of VPs we can
map at least half of their trafﬁc and are able to map over 96% of
trafﬁc for the majority (>50%) of peers.
These results show that when evaluating the Internet-wide im-
pact of a globally distributed system, it is necessary and sufﬁcient
to supplement public views of Internet topology with topological
information gathered from the edge of the network. The remainder
of this paper uses this information to understand where BitTorrent
ﬂows and its impact on ISP costs and revenue.

While it is well known that BitTorrent is used in nearly every
region and country worldwide, it is unclear how much of its trafﬁc

5.1 Mapping BitTorrent Flows
In the following paragraphs, we address the problem of mapping
BitTorrent ﬂows to the paths they traverse. In particular, we show
that publicly available path information such as BGP feeds are
insufﬁcient for mapping the vast majority of BitTorrent trafﬁc, and

nearly complete coverage.

stays local. In this section, we show that trafﬁc typically crosses
few country boundaries, and the average distance it travels for a
VP is strongly dependent on the VP location.
We ﬁrst discuss the issue of locality of trafﬁc. To represent this
graphically, at the continent granularity, we determine the portion
of each vantage point’s trafﬁc that ﬂows to or from each continent.
Figure 7 plots this as CDFs, where a point (x, y) for a given
continent indicates that for a fraction y of the peers, the portion
of their trafﬁc ﬂowing to endpoints in that continent is less than
or equal to x. Curves closer to the lower right indicate continents
receiving the largest share of peer trafﬁc.
The ﬁgure includes these data for vantage points in each of the
top three continents (by number of BitTorrent users). We observe
that on average a VP exchanges more trafﬁc with peers in the same
continent than in any other. The effect is strongest in Europe (75%
of trafﬁc from European VPs stays within Europe), which contains
the largest portion of BitTorrent users. Both North America and
Asia exchange much larger portions of intracontinental trafﬁc than
their user populations would indicate.
Some of the reasons for the observed locality include content
interest (e.g. based on language) as well as temporal trends – peers
in a continent tend to use the system at the same time (as shown in
Sec. 4). To test whether we ﬁnd locality trends in trafﬁc patterns,
we plot the geographic distribution of connected peers, grouped by
the continent for each VP (Fig. 8). The graph indeed shows that the
distributions of connections per VP continent is similar to those for
trafﬁc.
Figure 9: For each peer, the proportion of trafﬁc that passes
through up to C different countries. 73% of all trafﬁc at most
travels one country from its origin.
To obtain a ﬁner-grained view of how far aggregate BitTorrent
trafﬁc travels, we plot a CDF of each vantage point’s trafﬁc that
passes through up to C countries (Figure 9). For 80% of vantage
points, the majority of their trafﬁc travels at most to one other
country. Of the total trafﬁc, we ﬁnd that 32% stays within the same
country, and an additional 41% travels to only one other country.
These results show that while BitTorrent’s ﬂows are geographi-
cally diverse, the location of a user (and the popularity of BitTorrent
in that region) has a strong inﬂuence on the location of connected
endpoints.
In aggregate, BitTorrent trafﬁc exhibits surprisingly
high geographic locality – often traveling to at most one additional
country. In the next section, we evaluate whether this locality holds
when viewed in terms of the network topology.

5.3 Topological Locality
We now examine the topological properties of BitTorrent trafﬁc
to determine which types of networks it traverses. We note that
while these results may be affected by ISP-imposed throttles on
interdomain trafﬁc, our goal is to understand the impact of the
system in its current environment. For this analysis, we map trafﬁc
to Internet tiers based on the classiﬁcations by Dhamdhere and
Dovrolis [7], last updated in January 2010. This work classiﬁes
ASes into the tiers shown in Table 4, based on inferred business
relationships. We apply this to categorize peers and routers in our
dataset and ﬁnd that, as one would expect, most BitTorrent users
are located in lower network tiers (Table 5).
An interesting question related to the network impact of BitTor-
rent trafﬁc is how deep into the “core” of the network it ﬂows. We
want to understand whether the trafﬁc more frequently enters large
transit providers or stays at lower tiers of the topology. To evaluate
this, we determine the portion of each vantage point’s trafﬁc that
reaches tier T . For example, if a ﬂow traverses from tier 4 to tier 2
and back to tier 4, the ﬂow is counted as reaching tier 2. Figure 10
plots the result as a CDF for each originating tier. Curves near the
bottom right indicate tiers receiving the largest portion of trafﬁc.
We ﬁnd that tier-3 networks handle more BitTorrent trafﬁc than
any other tier. While over 50% of the median peer’s trafﬁc stays in
tier 3, less than 10% (20%) goes up to tier 2 (tier 1).
To understand the role of the endpoint locations on the spread
of BitTorrent trafﬁc, we separate individual trafﬁc ﬂows by their
starting and ending Internet tiers, and determine the portion of that
trafﬁc ﬂowing to each of the other tiers. Figure 11 plots, for trafﬁc
between Tier T and Tier U, the proportion of that trafﬁc reaching
Tier V (such that V ≤ T ) as CDFs. As an example, Figs. 11a–
11c show that, for trafﬁc with at least one endpoint in tier 2, the
majority of trafﬁc stays in a tier-2 AS without passing through a
tier-1 network.
Overall, the ﬁgures show that BitTorrent trafﬁc most often stays
in the same tier from which it originated. For instance, the trends
for tiers 3 and 4 – where the vast majority of BitTorrent users are
located – show that most trafﬁc does not go above tier-3 (Figs. 11d–
11f). Further, for trafﬁc between two tier-4 ASes, we see that the

Tier T . The vast majority of trafﬁc only reaches tier 3, with
signiﬁcantly less trafﬁc going to tier 1 or tier 2.
largest component of trafﬁc unexpectedly stays in tier 4. When
combined with results from geographic locality, this indicates that
much of BitTorrent trafﬁc remains in the same region and can
be handed off among regional ISPs instead of using large transit
providers.
This section showed that BitTorrent trafﬁc exhibits strong local-
ity, both geographically and in terms of network topology. In the
next section, we evaluate the economic impact on ISPs as a result
of these patterns.
6. ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF NETWORK
IMPACT
In this section, we address one of the key question driving P2P
research and ISP policies: how does the network impact of P2P
translate to costs and revenue for ISPs? The following paragraphs
present a detailed analysis of the potential impact of BitTorrent
trafﬁc on the variable costs/revenues of ISPs. For our analysis,
we use detailed traces of BitTorrent trafﬁc, comprehensive AS
topologies annotated with business relationships, and additional
information on interdomain trafﬁc volumes from a large ISP.
6.1 Overview
Interdomain trafﬁc is an important component of ISPs’ opera-
tional costs. A number of research efforts have focused on reducing
interdomain trafﬁc generated by P2P systems [1, 2, 5, 30]. Earlier
studies have assumed that all interdomain trafﬁc incurs charges. In
practice, however, charges are a function of both the total trafﬁc
ﬂowing over each interdomain link and the business relationships
between ISPs.
Thus, in the ﬁrst step of our analysis, we map BitTorrent ﬂows
to inter-AS links annotated with actual business relationships –
customer-provider, provider-customer, peer or sibling. To this end,
we use the algorithm proposed by Xia et al. [29], which leverages
the valley-free and selective export policies of BGP routing to infer
the relationship between connected ASes. This allows us to infer
relationships for 98.3% of the 222,675 AS links in our dataset.
We assume that transit charges occur only between customers and
providers, resulting in costs for the customer and revenue for the
provider. We further assume peering and sibling relationships to be
settlement free, with no side paying the other to carry trafﬁc [8].
In the next step of our analysis (Sec. 6.2), we model the net
impact of those ﬂows on ISP costs. A signiﬁcant challenge is
the diverse and commonly conﬁdential charging models for transit
agreements between ISPs. Absent this information, we ﬁrst use
a basic cost model that focuses on variable costs, assigning transit
