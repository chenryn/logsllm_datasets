User: Is there a way using Python to simulate the presence of an active network connection using dbus? If I call getstate() on the dbus, I'm able to get the current network state. I want to set the current state to 4 (Connection Present). This is because Network Manager is not able to connect using my modem and I use other tools to connect. Pidgin, Empathy and other software are not able to detect the network.
Assistant: Your options are to write something that mocks NetworkManager's D-Bus interface, or to write a module for NetworkManager that supports the tools you use.
