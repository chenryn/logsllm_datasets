solution to protect all records. In addition, they are concerned
about other new regional privacy laws (e.g., the California
Consumer Privacy Act [13]), so changing all records at once
saves extra work in the future. On the other hand, changing
WHOIS records universally could have an adverse impact on
security applications relying on WHOIS data, and we discuss
this issue in Section VI.
V. LONG-TAIL WHOIS PROVIDERS
To provide a broader view of the status of GDPR compli-
ance, we extend the time window from 1 week to 2 months in
order to cover WHOIS providers with smaller number of EEA
domains. A provider is selected for this measurement task if it
has over 50 (i.e., 2× min_samples) EEA records collected
in every 2-month window (12 windows in total). As a result,
we are able to inspect 256 WHOIS providers, increasing
the number under the previous task (143) by nearly 80%.
Accordingly, Condition 1 is adjusted: if the outlier ratio stays
Fig. 9: The outlier ratio of registrars in the last 2-month window (Nov - Dec 2019). The size of each block indicates the registrar
domain share. Registrars which have less than 50 records collected in this period are not analyzed.
below 0.05 for 5 windows in 2019, the provider is classiﬁed
as fully-compliant. Below we describe the measurement results
on registries and registrars separately.
Registries. In total, 119 registries are selected and we ﬁnd that
113 (95.0% of 119) are classiﬁed as fully-compliant. Except
for the 3 registries already discussed in Section IV (.us,
.cat and .srl), we ﬁnd 3 more country-code TLD (ccTLD)
registries using ﬂawed data protection measures. In detail,
registries of .gs and .cx are not protecting the registrant
address ﬁelds for around 50% of their sponsoring domains.
Meanwhile, the .mn WHOIS server (whois.nic.mn) copies
records from lower-level registrar WHOIS servers and the
ﬂaw is rooted in the registrars. Though ccTLD registries are
not contracted with ICANN under the RA, which are thus
not required to enforce the ICANN Temporary Speciﬁcation,
we recommend them to review their current policies when
domains can be registered by EEA citizens.
Observation 7: Registrars with larger domain share have
better compliance with the GDPR. The status is more
worrying for smaller registrars.
Registrars. In total, 137 registrars are analyzed, with a total
domain share of 72.77%. Similar to our prior observations in
Section IV, we ﬁnd that most providers have responded to the
GDPR well: 105 (76.6% of 137, with a total domain share of
60.76%) are classiﬁed as fully-compliant. Meanwhile, we also
ﬁnd that registrars with larger domain share tend to comply
with the requirements better: 21 out of 32 partially- or non-
compliant registrars have a domain share of less than 0.07%.
In Figure 9 we visualize the relation between the domain
share and compliance level for EEA and non-EEA domains
separately. The size of each block indicates the domain share
of a registrar, and the color marks the outlier ratio. We choose
the last 2-month time window (Nov - Dec 2019) to focus on
the most recent status. One interesting observation is that for
large registrars sponsoring a small number of EEA domains,
data masking is also extensively applied to non-EEA domains
(e.g., ID-420 Alibaba Cloud).
VI. WHOIS USAGE IN SECURITY APPLICATIONS
WHOIS data has been a key ingredient in powering many
security applications, such as domain reputation systems and
spam detection systems. However, due to the data redaction
performed by WHOIS providers, the effectiveness of these
applications becomes questionable. This issue has been dis-
cussed [59], [56] but no study has quantiﬁed the impact. In
this section, we make the ﬁrst attempt from the perspective of
security literature.
A. Survey of Security Literature
The high-level idea of this task is to collect academic
papers describing the usage of WHOIS and classify them based
on how WHOIS is used. We focus on academic papers because
most of them have a clear description of the features and the
papers are easier to collect. For systems developed by the
industry, based on our discussion with a number of security
companies, WHOIS also provides key features (e.g., [67]) for
applications like threat intelligence.
Methodology for paper collection. As the ﬁrst step, we down-
load all research papers published at 4 top-tier security confer-
ences (NDSS, USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, ACM CCS) and
1 leading measurement conference (ACM IMC) since 2005,
and select those using WHOIS data. To fetch papers, we build
a web crawler based on Chromium [14], collect conference
program pages and extract paper downloading links. On the
corpus of 4,304 downloaded papers, we manually build a list
of keywords (e.g., “WHOIS” and “domain”) and search in the
papers to ﬁlter out irrelevant works. For the 193 remaining
papers, we read all of them and remove false positives (e.g.,
papers using the IP WHOIS database).
Observation 8: The GDPR’s impact on security applications
relying on WHOIS could be profound, as 69% of surveyed
papers need to use redacted information.
In the end, we are able to ﬁnd 51 papers using WHOIS
data. Among them, 35 (69%) use ﬁelds that should be redacted

1 WHOIS ﬁelds: R: Registrant, A: Admin, T: Tech, Em: Email address
2 (cid:32): The paper explicitly describes WHOIS data usage; (cid:71)(cid:35): No explicit descriptions,
but usage can be inferred from context.
3 WHOIS usage: D: Detection (used for labeling datasets or as features of detection
systems), M: Measurement (used for providing measurement results), V: Validation
(used for validating results of detection systems), N: Notiﬁcation (used for reporting
vulnerabilities to domain holders)
in response to the GDPR. Table VI characterizes the 35 papers,
including the application scenarios and WHOIS ﬁelds that
are used. Several papers mention WHOIS datasets but do
not have a clear description of which ﬁelds are used – we
infer their WHOIS usage according to the paper context. For
the remaining 16 (31%) papers, ﬁelds that do not contain
personal information are used (e.g., domain creation date and
sponsoring registrar). Because they are out of the scope of the
GDPR, we consider these works not impacted, and they are
characterized in Table VII of Appendix B.
Characterization of WHOIS usage. Here, we provide an in-
depth study of the 35 papers relying on the redacted data.
As shown in Table VI, the WHOIS database has been used
by works on domain security (11 papers), fraud and spam
detection (5 papers), cyber-crime analysis (4 papers), privacy
protection (3 papers) and HTTPS measurements (3 papers).
We classify WHOIS usage in the papers according to
their speciﬁc purposes: measurement (22 papers), detection
(8 papers), vulnerability notiﬁcation (4 papers) and result
validation (3 papers). Among the redacted WHOIS ﬁelds,
registrant contact and email address are extensively leveraged,
covering 29 and 26 papers. Admin and tech contact are
less used, covering 15 papers. In particular, while over 70%

GDPR-compliant registrars offer channel to contacting domain
holders via web forms or pseudonymized email addresses
(per Observation 4), challenges still remain as the scale of
notiﬁcation can be large (e.g., 5K apps in [22] and 24K
domains in [97]) and ﬁlling the forms automatically is not
always feasible. Works using WHOIS for detecting malicious
entities or validating results rely on the authentic ﬁeld values
as detection features or ground truth. For measurement studies,
the masked ﬁelds are heavily used to identify spam campaigns
