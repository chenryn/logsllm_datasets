Does anyone know whether AdaBoostClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier have
been improved to work with sparse matrix input X? If not, are there any
suggestions on current free AdaBoost package that works with sparse matrix? If
I need to implement my own version of AdaBoost that can takes sparse matrix,
what kind of change should I make?
Thanks!
