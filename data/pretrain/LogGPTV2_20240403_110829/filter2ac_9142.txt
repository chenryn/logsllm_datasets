### ATT&CK ID: M1021
### ATT&CK Technique Name: Restrict Web-Based Content

Administrators can implement several measures to restrict web-based content and enhance security. One such measure is to block end-user consent to OAuth applications, thereby preventing users from authorizing third-party apps through OAuth 2.0. This forces all authorization requests to go through administrative review and approval. Additionally, administrators can prevent end-users from registering new applications, which helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized or potentially malicious applications being used within the organization.

A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) can be employed to further control and ban specific applications. Azure provides several enterprise policy settings in the Azure Management Portal to assist with these restrictions:

1. **Prevent User-Registered Applications:**
   - Navigate to "Users -> User settings -> App registrations."
   - Set "Users can register applications" to "No." This setting will prevent users from registering new applications, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized app usage.

2. **Prevent User Consent for Third-Party Apps:**
   - Navigate to "Enterprise applications -> User settings -> Enterprise applications."
   - Set "Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf" to "No." This setting will prevent users from consenting to allow third-party multi-tenant applications, ensuring that all such consents are managed by administrators.

By implementing these policies, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture and reduce the risk associated with unauthorized or unvetted web-based content.
