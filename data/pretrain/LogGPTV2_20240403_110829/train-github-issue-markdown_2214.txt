We recommend enabling ProGuard for Android builds in release mode. ProGuard is a tool that removes unnecessary code and resources, thereby reducing the APK size.

For more information, please refer to the official documentation: [Shrink, Obfuscate, and Optimize Your Code](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html).

Currently, enabling ProGuard on the Flutter Gallery reduces the APK size by approximately 24KB. Although this may seem insignificant, the potential for further reduction is considerable. For instance, with ProGuard enabled, we can include dependencies on the Android Support Libraries in the engine without significantly increasing the APK size, as ProGuard will eliminate any unused code.

In particular, for our accessibility work, using the Android Support Libraries would be beneficial. These libraries provide convenient abstractions over the raw Android APIs and ensure backward compatibility with older API versions.
