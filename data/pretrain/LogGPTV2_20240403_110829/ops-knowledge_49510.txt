User: Python for Windows by default comes with IDLE, which is the barest-bones IDE I've ever encountered.  For editing files, I'll stick to emacs, thank you very much.
However, I want to run programs in some other shell than the crappy windows command prompt, which can't be widened to more than 80 characters.  
IDLE lets me run programs in it if I open the file, then hit F5 (to go Run-> Run Module).    I would rather like to just "run" the command, rather than going through the rigmarole of closing the emacs file, loading the IDLE file, etc.  A scan of google and the IDLE docs doesn't seem to give much help about using IDLE's shell but not it's IDE.  
Any advice from the stack overflow guys?  Ideally I'd either like

advice on running programs using IDLE's shell
advice on other ways to run python programs in windows outside of IDLE or "cmd".

Thanks,

Assistant: You can easily widen the Windows console by doing the following:

click the icon for the console window in the upper right
select Properties from the menu
click the Layout tab
change the Window Size > Width to 140

This can also be saved universally by changing the Defaults on the menu.
