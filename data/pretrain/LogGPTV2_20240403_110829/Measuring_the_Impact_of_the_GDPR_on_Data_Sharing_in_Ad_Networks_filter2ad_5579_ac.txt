CW 20, before the GDPR came into effect, and the dark gray dots
represent the other measurements (M#2 to M#12). We performed
two types of linear regression analysis including the measurement,
one before the GDPR took effect ypre(gray dotted line) and one
excluding it, ypost (black dashed line).
We chose a linear regression because a nonlinear regression for
the number of measuring points and values could lead to overfitting.
Moreover, the Pearson (nodes pre: 0.3, nodes post: -0.0; sync pre:
-0.5, sync post: -0.6) and Spearman (nodes pre: 0.3, nodes post: 0.0;
sync pre: -0.6, sync post: -0.7) coefficients are close to each other,
indicating that linear regression is appropriate for our purpose.
Comparing both trends, we see a significant difference in the slope
of the regression lines.
To confirm that the number of embedded third parties over all
websites between M#2–M#12 is statistically significantly different
from M#1, we calculate the confidence interval (99 % confidence) for
the prediction of the previous curve for the pre-GDPR measurement
on the basis of the values without the value of measurement M#1. If
the value of our pre-GDPR measurement is outside the confidence
interval, we confirm that by the time of the introduction of the
GDPR, the number of nodes has decreased.
The result is 7,151 as the lower confidence limit and 11,774 as the
upper confidence limit (see the red interval in Figure 6a). With a
value of 12,304, the first measurement is barely outside the interval.
Thus, we see evidence that the amount of parties used in M#1 is
independent of the number of parties observed in the remaining
EU measurements. We need to be careful in the interpretation of
these numbers as it is a matter of an effect of the GDPR and not
directly about the GDPR itself. The strength of the effect is rather
small, since the value of M#1 lies only barely outside the interval.
As shown in Table 2, the amount of third parties per website stays
more or less stable across all measurements, while Figure 6a shows
a drop of third parties used from M#1 to M#2. However, Table 2
lists domain averages and Figure 6a shows companies aggregated
over all domains. The overall decrease is in line with previous work
that found that websites tended to switch to larger ad networks
(e. g., Google or Facebook) when the GDPR took effect [8]. Thus,
it is reasonable that the absolute number of observed companies
drops (smaller companies disappear), while the total amount of third
parties stays stable. We discuss the measured effects on companies
active in the ecosystem in Section 6.
Before the GDPR enforcement, the graph M#1 contained 12,304
nodes, 11,738 of which are isolated. Isolated nodes have no connec-
tion to another node and represent third-party companies that are
embedded into websites but do not perform cookie syncing (e. g.,
a JavaScript library). Overall, the number of third parties, isolated
or not, decreases over the course of our study. However, without
the pre-GDPR measurement the trend of embedded thrid parties is
slowly rising. All further findings exclude the isolated nodes (i. e.,
we only analyzed the nodes that engage in cookie syncing).
Figure 6b shows the number of ID sharing connections. Of par-
ticular interest is the reduction of syncing relations by about 40 %
over the course of our measurement—in terms of the number of
direct syncing connections. The corresponding linear regression
analysis confirms that both trends with (ypre, gray line) and without
(ypost, black line) the pre-GDPR measurement are both decreasing
to different extents.

5.1 Third-Party Sharing Ecosystem
The data of each measurement was processed and sorted to con-
struct a graph that represents embedded third parties and infor-
mation sharing networks (see Section 4 and Table 3). All graphs
are undirected. Figure 5 visualizes graph plots of the first two mea-
surements. Nodes represent companies and edges represent ID
syncing between the companies. Therefore, the nodes reflect the
total number of third parties embedded in websites and could po-
tentially collect and share personal data. A decrease in the number
of nodes means that first parties embed—directly or indirectly—less
third parties (e. g., less trackers or companies participate in the
ad bidding process). The amount of edges reflects the number of
companies syncing IDs. A smaller number of edges means that
fewer companies participate in the sharing economy. The most
dominant important node is representing Google. Other important
nodes represent companies such as AppNexus, Amazon, or Oracle.
Figures 6a and 6b show the number of nodes and edges per
measurement. The y-axis represents the number of nodes or con-
nections and the x-axis represents the calendar weeks (CW). The
thick light gray dot on the left is the first measurement M#1, in
Figure 5: The graphs demonstrate the change of syncing connection between our pre-GDPR measurement on May, 19 2018
(M#1, left) and the measurement right after the GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018 (M#2, right). A reduction of nodes and
edges is visible. The weight, calculated by the PageRank algorithm, of the individual nodes in the graph is represented by the
strength of the color and size of the node (the darker and bigger, the more important). The importance of the edges is also
quantified by the color (the darker, the more important). Additionally, the three most significant nodes are labeled.

(b) Number of syncing connections per measurement
Figure 6: Regression lines of our measurements including the pre-GDPR measurement (gray) and excluding it (black). The red
dashes represent the confidence interval (99 % confidence) of the prediction for the pre-GDPR measurement point based on
all post-GDPR measurements.
To test if there is a statistically significant difference in ID sync-
ing activities between M#1 and the remaining EU measurements,
we again calculate a 99 %-confidence interval for the prediction of
the curve for the pre-GDPR measurement on the basis of the values
without the pre-GDPR measurement. The pre-GDPR measurement
value (898) is outside the interval (347 lower limit, 686 upper limit),
thus we see strong evidence that in M#1 and the remaining mea-
surements different levels of ID syncing occurred. In this case, the
strength of the effect is more obvious than with the nodes before.
Furthermore, we compared the linear regression lines including
(ypr e, dotted gray lines) and excluding (ypost , dashed black lines)
the pre-GDPR measurement. In both cases, the slopes are lower
which indicates that the drop between the first and second mea-
surement is significantly larger than in the following weeks but is
part of a general trend towards fewer third parties that also sync
less.
Table 4 provides an overview of the connections within the
graphs, excluding the isolated nodes. To measure whether the ef-
fects on the number of third parties and syncing are independent,
we separated the graphs into connected components. Each con-
nected component represents a subgraph in which nodes are con-
nected to each other by paths. M#1 has 59 components, with the
largest component containing 429 nodes. The percent values reflect
the reduction and always refer to the initial graph M#1, so the num-
ber of components is reduced from M#1 to M#12 by a maximum
of around 56 % (M#6). Another difference is the size of the largest
component, which is reduced by up to 55 % (M#10). However, the
median component size remains stable at around two throughout
all measurements. This indicates that overall components were not
affected by the disappearing connections. However, the number of
components did drop.
Similarly, the algebraic connection is a measure for the number
of nodes and the number of connections between the nodes within
the graph. This value can be interpreted as the robustness of the
graph with regard to the connections. The lower the value, the
fewer connections are present. The values of the algebraic connec-
tion vary between positive 25 % and negative 60 % compared to the
initial measurement. The evaluation shows that the total number of
links in the graph fluctuates, but numbers are similar comparing the
first and the last measurement (-0.51 %). Although individual mea-
surements vary due to the internal structure of the ecosystem over
the course of our measurements, we did not measure a significant
effect on the structure of our graphs over time.
The reduction in the number of edges and nodes both follow
an overall downward trend: Fewer third parties are present in the
ecosystem and these share fewer IDs (see Figures 6a and 6b). How-
ever, over the month following the introduction of the GDPR, the
number of nodes slightly increases again, whereas the number of
edges continues to decrease. Therefore, the number of nodes can
theoretically be represented by a quadratic function.

sured graphs (M#1–M#12) and the shift after the GDPR took

Comparing the results from our crawls conducted in Europe
with our two reference measurements from US-based IP addresses,
we observed that the amount of cookie syncing for website visits
from the USA is about 15 % higher than the amount measured at a
similar points in time from the EU (CW43 and CW5—which where
conduct one week prior to the US measurements). Furthermore,
we found that there are more connected nodes in the US measure-
ments (+33 %) and that there are less components (-22 %) but the
existing components are larger (+9 %) and more connected (+58 %).
However, we observed less nodes in total (-12 %). Hence, in our US
measurements we observed less third parties in general but these
sync private data more extensively and are more connected with
each other.
Table 5 presents the general graph characteristics of our con-
ducted measurements (M#1-M#12). The longest possible distance
between two nodes (i. e., the diameter), modularity and medium
degree of the graphs remains more or less stable. Nevertheless, the
number of communities is reduced from 69 in M#1 to 50 communi-
ties in M#2 and 47 communities in M#3, and even 34 communities
in M#6. Note that the values of communities and the values of mod-
ularity may vary due to the algorithm used to determine the values.
We use the software Gephi 0.9.2 [5] to compute the communities
and modularity. The average clustering coefficient shows a decrease.
The average distance between node pairs in the graph indicates the
average path length. These values do not change much across the
course of all our measurements. This indicates that the underlying
ecosystem remains unchanged.

nodes.
