A MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF RINGING
ARTIFACTS IN MODULATED REPLAY
AUDIO
Theorem A.1. Uncertainty Principle: It is hard to accurately de-
termine the entire frequency response of a loudspeaker.
Proof. The frequency response of a loudspeaker contains ampli-
tude response and phase response. The measurement of amplitude
response is demonstrated in Section 3.4. However, it is difficult to
accurately measure the phase response.
For an electronic circuit system, the phase response can be mea-
sured by observing the electric signals 𝑥𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑡) and 𝑥𝑖𝑛(𝑡) with an
oscilloscope. But in a loudspeaker system, we cannot measure the
phase response directly because the output signal 𝑥𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑡) is a sound
wave. Other equipment (such as a receiver that converts sound wave
to electronic signal) is required to complete the measurement. But
the measuring system can introduce other phase differences. There
are mainly three influence factors:
(1) Time of flight. The propagation time will add phase differ-
ences. It is important to know the accurate delay time 𝑡 = 𝐿/𝑣0,
where 𝐿 is the direct distance between the speaker and the sensor.
The sound speed 𝑣0 ≈ 344m/s (@20◦C).
(2) Time incoherence. Most of the available loudspeakers are not
time coherent, which will exhibit phase error in the measurement.
