User: I'm running errbot in a docker container, we did the !backup and we have the backup.py, but when i start the docker container it just run /app/venv/bin/run.sh
but i cannot pass -r /srv/backup.py to have all my data restored.
any ideas?
all the data is safe since the /srv is a mounted volume
Assistant: I think the best if you run Errbot in a container is to run it with a real database for the persistence (redis for example).
Then you can simply run backup.py from anywhere (including your dev machine).
Even better, you can just do a backup of your redis directly.
