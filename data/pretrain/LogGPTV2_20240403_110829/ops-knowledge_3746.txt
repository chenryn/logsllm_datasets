**Reinstalling pyserial on OS X (Mavericks) with Python 3.3.3**

OS X (Mavericks) comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed, but I prefer to use Python 3.3 for my personal projects. Recently, I upgraded from Python 3.3.2 to 3.3.3, and now I need to reinstall the `pyserial` package.

Previously, I installed `pyserial` by following these steps:
1. Download `pyserial` from PyPI.
2. Untar the downloaded file (`pyserial.tgz`).
3. Navigate to the `pyserial` directory.
4. Run the installation script: `python3 setup.py install`.

However, I would like to use a more streamlined approach, such as using `pip3` to install `pyserial`. To do this, I need to ensure that `pip3` is available for Python 3.3.3.

Here’s how you can set up `pip3` for Python 3.3.3:

1. Install Python 3.3.3 via Homebrew if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   brew install python3
   ```

2. Verify that `pip3` is installed and check its version:
   ```sh
   pip3 --version
   ```

Once `pip3` is set up, you can install `pyserial` with a single command:
```sh
pip3 install pyserial
```

This method simplifies the installation process and aligns with best practices for managing Python packages.
