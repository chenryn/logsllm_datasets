Question: "You are tasked with implementing a secure storage encryption feature for an Android device. As part of the solution, you need to ensure that the storage encryption keys are tied to the device's Verified Boot state and the user's Lock Screen Knowledge Factor. Additionally, you must utilize hardware-wrapped keys that are wrapped twice for added security. Which of the following steps are part of the correct implementation process?"
 "A": "Modify the KeyMint implementation to support 'TAG_STORAGE_KEY' and the 'convertStorageKeyToEphemeral' method."
 "B": "For Android 11 kernels, set 'BLK_CRYPTO_KEY_TYPE_HW_WRAPPED' in 'blk_crypto_profile::key_types_supported'."
 "C": "Integrate a custom KDF (Key Derivation Function) that differs from the hardware's implementation to enhance security."
 "D": "Add the 'wrappedkey_v0' flag to the 'fileencryption' and 'metadata_encryption' parameters in the device's 'fstab' file."
