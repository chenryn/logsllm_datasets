User: After selecting 1 + 1 and issuing python-send-region, my subprocess buffer shows no results. I have to evaluate print 1 + 1, instead.
How can I force the python-send-* commands to print the value of the respective statements rather than echoing their stdout?
Assistant: It sounds like you need print; use print.
emacs is launching a python process and getting text from its standard output, not a python value.
