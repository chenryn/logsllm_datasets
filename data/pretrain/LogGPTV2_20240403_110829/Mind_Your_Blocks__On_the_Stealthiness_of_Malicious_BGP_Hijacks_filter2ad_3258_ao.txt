spammers need to set up a dedicated infrastructure with their
own machines so that they can be assigned the hijacked IP
addresses.

hijacked IP address ranges. The remaining 86.3% of IP address ranges were
never announced before being hijacked.
Finally, 770 out of the 2,620 short-lived hijacks were
later conﬁrmed by an ISP, unwittingly involved in these
attacks. After receiving a lot of complains for spam, the ISP
discovered that one of their customers was indeed announcing
IP address blocks he did not own, which were indeed used
for nefarious activities as conﬁrmed by our observations. The
ISP has now terminated their contract with the misbehaving
customer (who turned out to be colluding with a spammer
apparently based in Russia).
D. Root cause analysis results
In the previous section we have uncovered strong evidence
of BGP spectrum agility occurring in the Internet. However, we
have not systematically analysed if the identiﬁed hijacks are
isolated attacks or if some of them share a common root cause,
as we would expect if they are part of campaigns orchestrated
by the same spammers. This is why we have run the TRIAGE
clustering tool against all spam emails coming from the 64
supposedly hijacked IP address blocks which have sent spam
to our spamtraps.
The multi-criteria clustering tool has identiﬁed only 30
multi-dimensional clusters (MDC’s) in which spam emails
are correlated by various combinations of features. Because
of the way these clusters are generated, we anticipate they
likely represent different campaigns organized by the same
individuals - as spam emails within the same cluster share
several common traits. Thus 64 preﬁxes were used to run
30 different spam campaigns. In the following we will show
that some campaigns are rather short-lived and run from a
single preﬁx whereas others last for several days relying on a
number of different preﬁxes. Table II provides global statistics
computed across all MDC’s. Most spam campaigns seem to be
short-lived (lasting on average only a couple of days), except
two MDCs that existed for more than 30 days.
By clustering spam emails into campaigns, we obtain new
insights into hijacking spammers behavior. From the structure
of MDCs, we uncover three key modus operandi of hijacking
spammers: (1) 10 campaigns (out of 30) involve a single
hijacked IP preﬁx that is not abused elsewhere in any other
campaign, (2) 17 campaigns involve a single hijacked IP preﬁx,
yet the hijacked preﬁx is abused concurrently in different spam
campaigns, and (3) three campaigns were observed abusing
multiple hijacked IP preﬁxes sequentially over a longer period
Fig. 7. Episode 2 of short-lived hijacks between June 2013 and June 2014:
hijacks are always performed by groups of at least two IP preﬁxes. For the
sake of conciseness, only a sample of 87 (out of 2,562) IP address ranges
hijacked in June 2014 are depicted.
can thus sometimes be poorly documented and, for that reason,
has been considered to be a target of choice for spammers to
hijack them [22], [33]. This idea appears to be supported by
our data.
(C.4) Short-lived hijacked IP address blocks include /17’s,
/21’s, /22’s, /23’s and (92.6%) /24’s, similar to the long-lived
ones. Although those hijacks look like the ones Ramachandran
et al. in [35] reported, the average size of hijacked address
blocks is very different, namely /24, instead of /8.
(C.5) The analysis of whois records (from IRR databases)
of short-lived hijacked networks revealed that all IP address
blocks were, at the time they were hijacked, properly registered
blocks assigned to an organisation with sometimes multiple
blocks referring to the same organisation. Although we could
not check all 2,620 IP address blocks, we looked at 100 of
