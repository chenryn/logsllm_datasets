locates the power along other unaffected beams. If the tracking
error accumulates over time, mmReliable needs to initiate a beam
training to refresh the system or perform a handover.
Hybrid beamforming and mmReliable: Using multiple mmWave
RF chains and phased arrays can provide degrees of freedom to
multiplex users or improve throughput. Prior work [28, 29] has pro-
posed interference-aware spatial multiplexing of beams in different
directions for multiple users. These techniques fit with mmReliable
in many ways. First, many multi-beams can be created, one from
each RF chain, allowing mmReliable’s improvements for multiple
users. Second, in addition to per-beam phase, amplitude, and angle,
multiple RF chains allow for control over group delay, enabling
arbitrarily wideband operation. Finally, we can jointly use some
spatial beams for enhancing reliability while others for improving
multi-user coexistence.
