User: I have just started with Python. When I execute a python script file on Windows, the output window appears but instantaneously goes away. I need it to stay there so I can analyze my output. How can I keep it open?
Assistant: Apart from input and raw_input, you could also use an infinite while loop, like this:
while True: pass (Python 2.5+/3) or while 1: pass (all versions of Python 2/3). This might use computing power, though.
You could also run the program from the command line. Type python into the command line (Mac OS X Terminal) and it should say Python 3.?.? (Your Python version) It it does not show your Python version, or says python: command not found, look into changing PATH values (enviromentl values, listed above)/type C:\(Python folder\python.exe. If that is successful, type python or C:\(Python installation)\python.exe and the full directory of your program.
