I have installed Python 2.7.6 using the Windows Installer (Windows binary). Subsequently, I attempted to install the `pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe` extension. However, every time I run the installer for this extension, I encounter an error message stating, "pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe has stopped working."

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, you should run the installer with administrative privileges. In Windows, you can do this by right-clicking on the `pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe` file and selecting "Run as administrator." This action grants the necessary permissions to modify system files and folders, which is often required for software installation.

For macOS and Linux, you would use the `sudo` command to achieve similar elevated privileges, though in your case, the context is specifically for a Windows environment.
