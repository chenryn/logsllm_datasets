User: I installed Python 2.7.6 Windows Installer (Windows binary) and then, I was trying to install the extension pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe. But everytime I run this extension, I get the issue of "pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe has stopped working".
Assistant: You need to run it as administrator, anything that modifies folders it is not in or in its folder require root access which is right click -> run as admin in Windows or sudo in mac and linux.
