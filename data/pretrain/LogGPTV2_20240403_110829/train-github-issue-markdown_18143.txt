Consider enabling tabs inlined in the title bar by default, and also showing a
single visible tab for the starting shell (e.g. always show tabs, even if
there's only one process.)
This might reduce the every other day issue or comment asking why terminal
"doesn't work" because they don't know to press ctrl+T (understandably)
