In browsers, sending large array buffers over postMessage, for example to a
Worker, can be optimized by indicating that an ArrayBuffer (which is
Transferable) should transfer ownership, instead of being cloned. See the
transfer parameter to postMessage on MDN.
This does not appear to be working in Deno 1.12.2: `const tmp = new
Uint8Array(0); w.postMessage({ tmp }, [ tmp.buffer ]);` throws `DOMException:
Value not transferable` \- yet `const tmp = new Uint8Array(0); w.postMessage({
tmp }, [ ]);` succeeds.
There is a related issue #8341, but it's far more broad - this issue is
requesting only ArrayBuffer support, which is part of the spec all browsers
implement.
