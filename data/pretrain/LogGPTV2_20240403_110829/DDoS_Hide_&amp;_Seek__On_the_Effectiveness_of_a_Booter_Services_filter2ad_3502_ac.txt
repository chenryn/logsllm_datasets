bution of NTP packet sizes at the IXP in Figure 2(a). We observe
an almost bimodal distribution of 54% of the NTP packets that are
smaller than 200 bytes (likely benign traffic) and 46% that are larger
(likely attack traffic). Thus, we define a threshold of 200 bytes as
an optimistic classification criterion.
NTP amplification traffic in the wild. By applying our classifi-
cation, we find 311K destinations (Tier-1 ISP: 36K, Tier-2 ISP: 95K,
IXP: 244K) that receive NTP reflection traffic for the measurement
time (see Section 2). We plot the destination IPs (victims) of the
attack traffic in Figure 2(b). The plot shows the number of unique
amplification sources (y-axis) and the max traffic level in Gbps
over one minute (x-axis). The majority of traffic peaks (y-axis) are
between 5 and 100 Gbps (avg. 2.64 Gbps). Notably, 224 victims re-
ceives more than 100 Gbps, 5 more than 300 Gbps of attack traffic—a
single destination even up to 602 Gbps. Note that only observing
IXP (peering) traffic will underestimate the true attack volumes if
(not captured) transit links are used (see Section 3.2).
Higher traffic rates often involve a higher number of amplifiers
(sources): most destinations receive traffic from hundreds of ampli-
fiers, some even from thousands (avg. 35). Outliers, particularly for
the Tier-1 ISP, receive traffic from up to ∼8500 amplifiers.

We next study the max number of amplifiers per attack target
(unique dest. IP) within one minute bins, shown as CDF in Fig-
ure 2(c) (top). Most targets receive traffic from less than 5 reflectors.
For the Tier-1 and the IXP about 70% receive traffic from less than
10. Interestingly, for the Tier-2, 90% of the targets receive ampli-
fication NTP traffic from less than 10 amplifiers. For comparison,
we depict the CDF of attack traffic peaks within one minute per
target for all 3 data sets in Figure 2(c) (bottom). Only a fraction of
0.09 receives more than 1 Gbps peak traffic and at the IXP we see
158 targets receiving more than 100 Gbps. On the other hand, a
majority of targets receive a negligible amount of traffic.
Conservative NTP DDoS classification. We aim at identifying a
sample of NTP DDoS attacks with a low rate of false positives at the
cost of false negatives. Thus, we take a more conservative approach
by excluding two more cases of false positives, the scanning or
monitoring of NTP monlists [14] and the use of the NTP port by
custom applications. Based on insights from our self-attacks in
Section 3, we introduce two more filtering rules: (a) traffic to the
target has to be larger than 1 Gbps and (b) has to originate from
more than 10 amplifiers, where applying both rules reduces the
number of NTP destinations by 78% ((a) only: 74%, (b) only: 59%).
This results in a data set likely only containing NTP DDoS traffic.
Takeaway. NTP-based DDoS traffic is prevalent at all three vantage
points and can be classified using the proposed criteria. The observed
attacks involve traffic rates of up to 600 Gbps—often generated by a
large number of reflectors—during our observation period. The extent
and size of DDoS attacks we observe raises the question of whether
the takedown of booters has an effect on the attack traffic in general.
5 FBI TAKEDOWN OF 15 BOOTERS
On December 19, 2018 the FBI seized the domains of 15 booter web-
sites (e.g., critical-boot.com or quantumstress.net) [56]. All booters
seized were tested by the FBI prior to the takedown and “the FBI
determined that these types of services can and have caused dis-
ruptions of networks at all levels” [56]. Smaller seizures of single
booter domains had occurred previously, e.g., the seizure of web-
stresser.org with more than 138k registered users by investigators
in the U.S., U.K. and the Netherlands in 2018 [28]. Beyond domain
seizures, booter users and operators can face legal actions [30], e.g.,
the operator of Titanium Stresser was sentenced to years in prison

in 2017 [27]. Next we focus on studying the effects of seizures on
the overall DDoS attack traffic. That is, do booter take downs result
in a significant reduction in DDoS attack traffic?
5.1 Domain Perspective on Takedown
First, we take a control plane perspective on the available booter
domains. We use weekly snapshots of all .com/.net/.org domains to
identify booter websites by keyword matching following [46] (e.g.,
“booter”, “stresser”, “ddos-as-a-service”). This gives us an overview
of booter domains before and after the takedown. We identified 58
booter .com/.net/.org domains by manually visiting and verifying
each domain matching the keyword search. Using daily snapshots
of the Alexa Top 1M list [48], we rank the identified booter domains
by their median Alexa rank over each month, shown in Figure 3.
Booter domains that were seized in December are highlighted. We
observe the booter domains in the Alexa Top 1M to grow over time.
Seized domains have a high Alexa rank but not the highest among
all booter domains—notably they occasionally still appear in the top
1M list (likely as a result of press reports pointing to those domains).
Thus, despite the seizure of 15 domains, many alternative booter
sites exist. Following this, we select booter domains matching our
keyword search after the takedown. In this way, we identified a
new domain for the seized booter A that became active after the
takedown and entered the global Alexa Top 1M list on December
22—just three days after the seizure of their old domain. The new
domain was registered in June 2018 but remained unused until
the takedown. Our account credentials registered with the seized
domain still work with the new domain (at the time of this writing).
5.2 Traffic Perspective on Takedown
For studying any data plane effects of the recent mass-seizure in
2018 at our vantage points, we do a time series analysis of 122 days
beginning at Sep. 30, 2018 and ending at Jan. 30, 2019, spanning the
seizure of the domains on Dec. 19, 2018. We calculate the following
metrics: (a) wt30/wt40 is a boolean metric indicating whether a one-
tailed Welsh unequal variances test comparing the daily sum of
packets 30/40 days before and 30/40 days after the takedown finds
any significant difference at p = 0.05; (b) red30/red40 is the ratio of
the daily average of sums of packets 30/40 days before and 30/40
days after the takedown. Using these metrics, we investigate any
combination of suspicious protocol ports (NTP, memcached, DNS,
etc.) as source or destination port (to or from reflectors) for ingress

ter the takedown; wt30/wt40: significant lower packet counts

and 30/40 days after the takedown.
and egress traffic. We start with a discussion of traffic to DDoS
reflectors, as we found significant changes for this type of traffic.
Memcached traffic to reflectors. Memcached remains a popular
attack vector due to its unsurpassed amplification factor. As Mem-
cached is a AS-internal object caching daemon, it is not expected
to appear in regular inter-domain traffic. Consequently, we assume
that any UDP traffic with Memcached target port number 11211 is
traffic flowing to a DDoS memcached reflector and accept possible
noise added by scanning or other applications using the port. We
investigate the number of packets to memcached reflectors for the
IXP vantage point in Figure 4 (top). A statistically significant reduc-
tion can be found for the 30 day window (wt30) as well as for the 40
day window (wt40). The average daily number of packets after the
takedown is 22.50% (red30) and 27.72% (red40) compared to before.
A comparable and significant reduction was found for the tier-2
ISP as well (wt30/wt40 =True, red30 = 7.34%, red40 = 4.99%).
NTP traffic to reflectors. NTP is a leading amplification vector
due to the high number of open NTP reflectors. We compare traffic
to NTP reflectors under the assumption that any traffic with UDP

websites in Dec. 2018. By purchasing attacks against our own infras-
tructure from 4 popular booters, we study booter capabilities. The
attack traffic levels generated by cheaper non-VIP services are con-
siderably higher than reported in related work (avg. 1.4 Gbps) [47].
We are the first to report the capabilities of a premium (VIP) booter
service that peaks at 20 Gbps while promising 60-80 Gbps. In our
data sets, we observe NTP-based DDoS attack traffic to be prevalent
at all three vantage points. The attacks observed involve substan-
tial traffic rates of up to 600 Gbps during our observation period.
To study if booter takedowns of law enforcement agencies help
to reduce the attack traffic, we analyze the effect of an FBI-led
mass-seizure of 15 booter domains in Dec. 2018 on NTP, DNS, and
Memcached-based DDoS attacks. We reveal that the takedown im-
mediately had an effect on the DDoS amplification traffic especially
reflectors. However, it did not have any significant effect on DDoS
traffic hitting victims or on the number of attacks observed. This
shows that only seizing the front end is not enough as the under-
lying infrastructure of reflectors remains online and is utilized by
third parties. Moreover, we found at least one booter to become ac-
tive under a new domain shortly after the seizure, while the number
of booter service domains in total increased over the measurement
period despite the seizure. Our study aims to inform network op-
erators to better understand the current threat-level, but also law
enforcement agencies to recognize the need of additional efforts to
shut down or block open reflectors. Since our study is limited to
technical parameters, the question arises whether this is sufficient
to assess the health of the booter ecosystem. This motivates the
need to better study the effects of law enforcement on the booter
economy, e.g., on infrastructures, financing, or involved entities.

target port 123 is a spoofed packet for triggering an attack, i.e., in-
cluding false negatives such as legitimate NTP requests. Even when
accepting this unquantifiable amount of noise, we find significant
reductions in traffic to NTP reflectors for the ISP vantage point (see
4, middle). After the seizure, the number of packets falls to 39.68%
(red30) and 26.97% (red40) respectively. The same is true for the IXP
vantage point (wt30/wt40 =True, red30 = 22.5%, red40 = 27.72%).
DNS traffic to reflectors. Similiar to NTP and Memcached, DNS is
abused for DDoS as a reflector. However, separating the comparably
large share of legitimate from illegitimate requests is difficult. Thus,
our results for DNS request packets at the Tier-2 ISP’s vantage
point (Fig. 4, bottom) are not as visually impressive as for other
vectors. Nevertheless, we find a statistically significant reduction
