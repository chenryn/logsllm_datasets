User: I am running command-line Python scripts from the Windows taskbar by having a shortcut pointing to the Python interpreter with the actual script as a parameter.
After the script has been processed, the interpreter terminates and the output window is closed which makes it impossible to read script output.
What is the most straightforward way to keep the interpreter window open until any key is pressed?
In batch files, one can end the script with pause. The closest thing to this I found in python is raw_input() which is sub-optimal because it requires pressing the return key (instead of any key).
Assistant: One way is to leave a raw_input() at the end so the script waits for you to press Enter before it terminates.
