  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: Windows 7 x64
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Open Visual Studio Code (called window 1)
  2. Open D:\Project
  3. CTRL-SHIFT-N or File -> New Window (called window 2)
  4. In the new window, Open D:\Project again
expected:  
New Window, the window 2, will also have the folder D:\Project just like
window 1.
Result:  
Instead of opening the D:\Project in window 2, it give focus to window 1 and
leave window 2 sitll open nothing.
Reason:
  1. I am working with multi monitors, at least 2, and 1 monitor will most likely only able to hold 2 tabs at max so that i can compare code within the same project. I will need another window to put the other tab even though it's under the same folder, maybe it's not a problem i i have the same monitor resolution, but currently, i am using one laptop monitor (1366x768) and additional lcd monitor (1920x1080) which give problem if i try to display the editor under resolution (3286x ????) just to compare codes.
  2. There is no option to let the editor tab float as independent window
