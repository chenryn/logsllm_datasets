User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer SDKs and connectors:
How can I tune Kusto Kafka Sink for better ingestion performance?

Assistant: [Kafka Sink](https://github.com/Azure/kafka-sink-azure-kusto/blob/master/README.md) users should [tune the connector](../../ingest-data-kafka.md) to work together with the [ingestion batching policy](batching-policy.md) by tuning batching time, size, and item number.
