Figure  5.  Array  structure  layout  and  current  directions 
causing  EM  failures.  Arrays  are  similar  to  register  files, 
except that the same bitlines are used for both reads and 
writes, and bitlines are paired for cells. The arrows depict 
the current direction on bl0_k when Cellik stores “0” and is 
being  read  and  on  its  complementary  bitline  when  the 
same cell stores “1” and is being read. 
Arrays  are  similar  to register  files,  except  that the 
same  bitlines  are used  for  both reads  and  writes, and 
bitlines are paired for cells, as illustrated in Figure 5. 
The  paired  bitlines  have  two  vias  per  cell,  and  the 
sharing  of  bitlines  makes  the  computation  of  the 
average  current  density  more  complicated.  For  reads, 
the  current  density  is  the  same  as  that  computed  for 
register  files.  When  cells  hold  “0”  and  are  being 
selected  by  asserting  the  wordline,  this  current  flows 
through  vias  on  bitlines  such  as  bl0_k  in  Figure  5.

current 
For  writes,  current  flows  on  the  bitlines  only  if 
writes cause cells to change value. To overwrite cells 
holding “1” by “0,” the bitline write input drivers pull 
down transistors in the cells, causing current flow from 
the  cells  to  the  bitlines.  However,  this  current  is 
relatively  small  and  can  be  ignored  since  pFET 
transistors in the cells are generally designed to be very 
weak. When cells holding “0” are overwritten by “1,” 
the write input drivers charge transistors in the cells as 
well as the capacitance of the bitlines, causing current 
similar to that of reads but only for the time needed to 
pull up transistors in the cells, giving (Cbitline·Vdd)/(γ·t), 
where γ is the duty cycle to pull up transistors in the 
cells.  The  complementary  bitlines  have  the  same

holding “1” are overwritten by “0.”

Ncells·Nports  for  bitlines  and  for  their  complementary

to  [5],  metal  lines  shorter  than  a  critical  length  (the

the critical length is between 3000 and 7000A/cm) are 
subject to a backflow of metal atoms, called the Blech

effect, toward the cathode (i.e., the opposite direction 
of  electron  flow),  resulting  in  an  offset  to  the  EM 
effect.  The  backflow  results  from  an  EM-induced 
stress  gradient.  The  drifted  metal  atoms  due  to  EM 
cause tensile stress by accumulating at the anode end, 
which results in an increase in the atomic density and 
compressive stress.

While the pFET devices in the reference circuit are 
assumed  to  be  under  constant  stress,  the  devices  in 
most  CMOS

discontinuously.  When  stress  is  removed,  the  NBTI 
effect  (i.e.,  the  shifted  VT)  can  undergo recovery  [7], 
making  the  device  less  vulnerable  to  NBTI.  Thus, 
NBTI  lifetime  is  strongly  affected  by  duty  cycle, 
defined to be the ratio of stress time to a given period 
of  time, i.e., the  time  period  over  which  the input  of 
pFET  devices  is  zero, divided  by  the given  period  of 
time.  For  more  accurate reliability  modeling,  we  take 
this  recovery  effect  into  account  by  finding  fitting 
curves of the NBTI VT shift equation given in [14] for 
various  duty  cycles,  making  the  exponent  in  the 
FORCNBTI equation given previously, n, a function of 
duty cycle. Assuming n = 0.25 with 100% duty cycle 
(i.e., constant stress) in accordance with the hydrogen-

where ∆Vc is the upper bound of VT shift affordable in 
the  circuit  which  employs  the  pFET  device.  Now  all 
we need for NBTI modeling is to find the number of 
effective defects per unit area (i.e., pFET devices of the 
structure that lie along critical paths) and duty cycle for 
the  microarchitecture  structure  of  interest.    Assuming 
the  SOFR  model  [2],  the  FIT  of  the  structures  is 
straightforwardly computed as the sum of the FITs of 
pFET  devices  belonging  to  those  structures.  Table  1 
lists the number of effective defects and duty cycle of 
devices over the area of various structures composing 
microarchitecture  operational  units,  from  which  the 
FIT can be found. In the table, T0 and T1 indicate the 
ratio  of  time  when  cells,  latches,  wire  repeaters,  and 
multiplexers  store  or  drive  “0”  and  “1,”  respectively.

Note that precharge transistors and pFET devices in the 
feedback circuit of latches are not vulnerable to NBTI 
as they are not on the critical path, and thus should not 
be included in FITs.

4.3. FIT of Microarchitecture Structures due to 
TDDB 
As  most  CMOS  devices  experience  discontinuous 
stress modes, we account for this using the duty cycle 
of stress for the devices in order not to underestimate 
their  lifetime.  Unlike  EM  and  NBTI,  TDDB  has  no 
recovery effect on digital circuits; however, removing 
the  stress  simply  suspends  gate  oxide  breakdown  [9]. 
Taking  this  into  account,  the  FIT  of  each  pFET  or 
nFET due to one breakdown is as follows:
