5  IDS Evaluation Results 
We have selected Snort 2.3.2 (released 10/03/2005) and 
Bro  0.9a9  (released  19/05/2005)  for  our  initial  evaluation 
of the efficiency of our data set and evaluation framework 
since they are two well-known and widely used IDS. 
flowbits.  In 
In the case of Snort, we used the set of rules included in 
the release. Bro comes with a Snort rule set translated into 
the  Bro  signature  language.  The  translated Snort rules are 
however  older  than  the  rules available  in Snort  2.3.2. Bro 
provides  a  rule  converter  (s2b)  that  not  only  translates 
Snort  rules  to a Bro format, but  also enhances Snort rules 
to reduce false positives. To get a fair comparison between 
Snort and Bro, we thus used s2b to update the Bro rule set 
from Snort 2.3.2 rules. One difficulty we encountered was 
that  the  s2b  converter  was  not  able  to  convert  all  Snort 
plug-ins  such  as  byte  test,  byte  jump,  isdataat,  pcre, 
window  and 
these  cases,  we  manually 
translated  into  the  Bro  language  the  Snort  rules  that  are 
used to monitor the vulnerability contained in our data set. 
In the results we report next, we used a subset of our data 
sets.  We  only  used  the  VEP associated to the most recent 
vulnerabilities that have been released before or around the 
release of Snort and Bro to provide a fair analysis for each 
IDS.  As  a  result,  StdSet  and  EvaSet  used  in  this  analysis 
include  102  VEP.  The  results  are  grouped  by  VEP  and 
classified  as  proposed  in  the  previous  section.  From 
StdSet,  5  groups  of  VEP  for  which  we  have  similar 
observations  are  discussed  (Sections  5.1  to  5.5).  In  the 
case  of  EvaSet,  we  mainly  focus  on  the  results  obtained 
from 
the  packet  fragmentation  and  HTTP  evasion 
techniques  (Section  5.6).  Section  5.7  summarizes  the 
results. 
5.1  Inconclusive Group 
The  first  inconclusive group contains VEP that did  not 
generate any successful attack against any targeted system. 
In  this  case,  18  VEP  were  undetected  by  both  Snort  and 
Bro  when  the  corresponding  traffic  traces  were  submitted 
to them. Thus, the analysis is inconclusive since we are not 
able  to  determine  whether  the  IDS  did  not  provide  any 
alarm  because  they  know  that  the  VEP  failed  or  because 
they  do  not  have  any  signature  in  their  database  to  detect 
those attacks. Those VEP, are therefore removed from the 
rest of the discussion on results. 
5.2  Complete Evasion Group 
Even though the VEP used to generate this data set are 
well-known  to  the  IDS  community,  some  of  them  are 
missed by the IDS. For 15 of the VEP used in this data set, 
both  Snort  and  Bro  seem  to  be  “blind”.  Fourteen  are 
classified  in  the  Quiet  and  Complete  Evasion  class,  and 
one is in the Partial Alarmist and Complete Evasion class. 
This is a reminder that the IDS signature database needs to 
be  updated  constantly  to  keep  up  with  new  attack 
variations. 
A  more  in-depth  analysis  provides  interesting  results. 
First,  VEP  such  as  samba_exp2.tar.gz,  THCIISSLame.c, 
lsass_ms0411.pm,  DcomExpl_unixwin32.zip,  and  HOD-
ms04011-lsarv-epx.c  evade 
intrusion  detection  even 
though  VEP  related  to  the  same  Bugtraq  ID  are  detected 
by both IDS. 
For  some  VEP,  only  one  of  the  two  IDS  was  “blind” 
and  the  other  was  able  to  detect  the  attacks.  In  particular, 
VEP  kod.c,  kox.c,  and  pimp.c  are  detected  by  Snort  but 
not  by  Bro  because  Bro  does  not  have  any  modules  to 
analyze  IGMP  (which  is  used  in  these  attacks).  Only  one 
VEP,  msrpc_dcom_ms03_26.pm,  is  not  detected  by  Snort 
and detected by Bro. 
5.3  Alarmist Group 
they 
raise 
alarms 
regardless  of 
One  of  the  main  results  that  emerged  from  this 
experiment is that both Snort and Bro are alarmist. In many 
situations, 
the 
vulnerabilities  of  the  targeted  systems  and  the  actual 
success of the attack. The Alarmist group is the list of VEP 
that have generated IDS alarms regardless of their success 
or  failure.  In  this  case,  a  network  administrator  does  not 
have  any  idea  if  the  attack  succeeded  or not. In fact,  only 
one of the VEP has been classified as Quiet and Complete 
Detection out of the 84 VEP for both Snort and Bro. Table 
2 reports2 on these VEP for which both Snort and Bro are 
Alarmist/Partially Alarmist. Other results (not shown here) 
indicate 
is  Alarmist/Partially 
Alarmist  for  a  total  of  49  (resp.  68)  of  the  84  conclusive 
VEP.

Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'06)0-7695-2716-7/06 $20.00  © 2006Some  results  are  partially  alarmists  for  two  reasons. 
First,  in  some  cases,  the  attack  did  not  complete.  This  is 
what  happened  with  smbnuke.c  that  does  not  completely 
execute  the  attack  against  Samba  servers.  Second,  some 
available  configurations  of  the  VEP  are  not  considered 
attacks.  In  some  cases,  the  VEP  offer  to  attack  ports  that 
are not checked by the IDS or in other situations, the VEP 
configurations are not considered attacks by both IDS.

5.4  Bro Enhancement Group 
Bro provides enhancement to Snort rules when they are 
translated  into  the  Bro  signature  language.  Bro  mainly 
provides  two  types  of  improvement  to  Snort  rules:  the 
error reply management and the attack server configuration 
context management. The error reply management is based 
on  the  hypothesis  that  if  an  attack  succeeds,  the  server 
replies with a positive response such as message code 200 
OK  for  HTTP  and  if  the  attack  fails,  we  get  an  error 
message  back  from  the  server  such  as  403  Access 
Forbidden  in  the  case  of  HTTP.  The  server  configuration 
rule  enhancement  context  is  based  on  the  hypothesis  that 
network configuration context information such as the type 
and  version  of  the  attacked  server  could  reduce  false 
positives. In this case, experience has shown [38] that IDS 
can  reduce  the  number  of  false  positives  they  generate 
and/or  prioritize  alarms  based  on  their  knowledge  of  the 
network context when attacks are identified. 
These improvements to the Snort rules by Bro are very 
effective. In fact, 30 of the results for the VEP have totally 
or  partially  moved  from  being classified as false positives 
for Snort to true negative for Bro: Snort provides results in 
the  Alarmist  /  Partially  Alarmist  group,  but  Bro is able to
