User: What is the evolution route of the IT shared service center from initial construction to perfection?
Assistant: The IT shared service center will go through four stages from initial construction to perfection, including standardization, systemization, centralization, expansion and optimization, intelligence and continuous improvement. In the standardization and systemization stage, it is necessary to formulate standardized software and hardware requirements and security policies to ensure the stability and security of the IT system. Based on best practices or standards, combined with organizational scenarios, it is necessary to unify IT operation and maintenance processes and formulate normative systems to improve IT service levels and efficiency. On the basis of the pilot at the headquarters, a benchmark needs to be established to promote a standardized and systematic IT management model to the entire company. In the stage of centralization, it is necessary to standardize desktop services and general services to realize the consolidation and centralization of services, so as to improve the quality and efficiency of IT services. It is necessary to complete the transformation of the mixed mode of insourcing + outsourcing, and outsource IT services to professional service providers to improve IT operation efficiency and reduce costs. Manage IT assets in a unified manner to realize visualized and refined management of IT assets. In the stage of expansion and optimization, it is necessary to manage the core application system to achieve refined management of the core business system, so as to improve the stability and reliability of the business system. Management processes need to be optimized and standard operating practices developed to improve IT service levels and efficiency. A mixed mode of business experts (insourcing + outsourcing) can be adopted, and core positions can be backed up to ensure business continuity and stability. Iterative optimization of knowledge accumulation and configuration management is required to ensure continuous improvement and promotion of IT services. In the stage of intelligence and continuous improvement, intelligent customer service can be gradually introduced to replace manual service desk customer service to improve IT service efficiency and response speed. Differentiated service level agreements need to be formulated to provide different IT services according to different business needs and service levels. Extensively use automation tools to handle repetitive and time-consuming work, improve IT service efficiency, reduce the burden on IT personnel, and improve IT service quality and efficiency.
