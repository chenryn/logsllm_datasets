## Priceless
- New computer: $900
- I/O box: $500
- Studio monitors and Microphone: $900
- Telling the RIAA to go fsck themselves: **Priceless**

## Purpose of This Presentation
This presentation aims to enlighten individuals on the current state of the music industry and propose a way to transform it for the better, benefiting both artists and consumers. It also demonstrates that high-quality recordings can be produced without the need for a large recording studio.

## What’s the Problem?
The recording industry is more about:
- **Profit for the company**
- **Image and product marketing**
- **Applying formulas to artistic works**
- **Telling people “This is cool, you should buy this”**
- **Neglecting consumer needs**
- **Benefiting only a few**

### Specific Issues:
- **Payola**: Yes, it still happens.
- **Resistance to change**: The industry fights to maintain the status quo.
- **Nepotism and favoritism**: Success often depends on who you know, not your talent.
- **Artists' rights**: Artists retain little or no control over their music.
- **Pirate Act**: The industry lobbies to turn copyright civil suits into criminal cases.

### Financial Mismanagement
- **Recording contracts**: Signing a contract is like winning the lottery, but with no guaranteed payout.
- **Profitability**: 90% of major label releases do not make a profit.
- **Tax write-offs**: Companies sign bands as tax write-offs and then drop them after the first year.
- **Overpriced CDs**: Despite claims, mass-produced CDs cost less than a dollar to produce.

### Resistance to Change
- **Fighting change**: The industry resists modernization, which would lead to its obsolescence if it were in the tech sector.
- **Comparison to the buggy industry**: The industry's resistance to change is akin to the buggy industry's refusal to adapt to automobiles.

### Impact on Radio
- **Limited playlists**: Out of 100 songs released weekly, only about 4 are added to the average radio playlist.
- **Radio conglomerates**: Two companies control 42% of listeners, often playing top hits over 100 times a week.
- **Support cancellation**: Clear Channel Communications, for example, has cut support for local musicians to increase profits.

### Why Don’t People Buy CDs?
- **Lack of quality content**
- **Interest in only one song**
- **High prices**
- **Availability of free alternatives**

### Applying Formulas
- **Hook timing**: 90% of all singles reach the hook within 20 seconds.
- **Song length**: 98% of #1 singles are under 3 minutes and 30 seconds.
- **Label interference**: Labels often request changes to lyrics or content they find offensive or unsellable.

### Food for Thought
- **Historical impact**: How would applying these formulas have changed iconic songs like "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin, "Hotel California" by the Eagles, or "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen?
- **Missed opportunities**: What unique music are we missing out on today due to these constraints?

## The Old Days
- **Contract necessity**: Distribution required a record deal.
- **Expensive equipment**: Recording and reproduction were costly.
- **Radio access**: Reaching radio stations was impossible without label backing.

## What Has Changed?
- **Affordable equipment**: High-quality, CD-standard recording equipment is now affordable.
- **Global distribution**: Worldwide distribution can be achieved at minimal cost.
- **Cheaper reproduction**: Reproduction costs have decreased.
- **Radio access**: College and internet radio stations are more open to independent artists.
- **Free recording**: You can record high-quality music with your own equipment.

### Additional Changes
- **High-speed internet**: More affordable and accessible.
- **Reduced travel**: No need to tour extensively to gain recognition.
- **Geographical freedom**: Artists can live anywhere and still reach a global audience.

## Independent Music Production: The Future
- **Level playing field**: Talent, not connections, will determine success.
- **Artists' rights**: Creators will retain full rights to their material.
- **Creative freedom**: No forced formulas or templates.
- **Increased variety**: A wider range of musical styles and genres.
- **Less competition**: Reduced rivalry between groups.
