Priceless
• New computer: $900
• I/O box: $500
• Studio monitors and Microphone: $900
• Telling the RIAA to go fsck themselves: 
Priceless
Purpose of this Presentation
• This presentation is for enlightening 
individuals on the current state of the music 
business and provides a way to completely 
change it in the future so that it better suits 
both artists and consumers.
• Prove that you don’t need a big recording 
studio to make a good recording
What’s the Problem?
The recording industry isn’t about music, it’s 
about:
• Money for the company
• Image and product
• Applying formulas to artistic works
• Telling people “This is cool, you should buy 
this.”
• Not caring for the consumers of their 
products
• Benefiting only a few
What’s the Problem?
• Payola - Yes it does happen
• Resistant to change
• They don’t think, they just have knee jerk 
reactions
• It’s not how good you are it’s who you know
• Artists retain little rights, if any, over their 
music
• Pirate Act: Lobbying to get copyright civil 
suits changed to criminal
Money for the Company
• Getting a recording contract is like winning 
the lottery, only winning the lottery you are 
guaranteed some money
• 90% of major label releases don’t make a 
profit
• Companies sign bands as tax write-offs and 
then dump them after the first of the year
• Overpriced CDs
Why does a CD Cost so Much?
• Record company: Manufacturing CDs is expensive!
• Survey says: Mass produced, replicated CDs are 
less than a dollar for the total package.   
-Side note: AOL gives away a ton of CDs
• Record Company: It costs a lot to record a CD.
• Survey says: Recording advances are given to 
artists which they have to pay back. Company 
doesn’t take the hit, unless they want to or unless it 
was stated in the contract the company would pay.
They Resist Change
• Fight tooth and nail to keep things the same
• What happens to other companies that resist 
change?
• If record companies were in the tech 
business they would be out of business
• They compare to the buggy industry
The Effects on Radio
• The Industry releases 100 songs per week and 
approx 4 are added to the average radio playlist
• Two radio conglomerates control 42% of the 
listeners
• Hit Top 40 Songs are often repeated over 100 
times a week
• One of these companies, Clear Channel 
Communications, cancelled its support for local 
musicians and listeners so they could make more 
money
Why don’t People buy CDs?
• There is nothing worth buying
• They only like one song
• Too expensive
• I can get it for free
Applying Formulas
• 90% of all singles get to the hook within 20 
seconds
• Approx. 98% of all #1 singles are less than 3 
minutes and 30 seconds long
• Labels often ask artists to change lyrics or 
content they find offensive or wouldn’t sell 
the album
Food for Thought
What if these same formulas were added to 
older music, how would that change things 
like:
• Stairway to Heaven – Led Zep
• Hotel California – Eagles
• Bohemian Rhapsody – Queen
How would this have changed music history? 
What are we missing out on today?
The Old Days
• Needed a contract for distribution
• Recording equipment was expensive
• Recording was expensive
• Reproduction was very costly
• Radio was impossible to reach without label 
backing
What Has Changed?
• Recording equipment capable of 16bit 
44.1Khz (CD quality) is very affordable
• Distribution can be done world wide with little 
or no cost
• Reproduction prices are cheap
• Plenty of college & Internet radio stations 
willing to play good music
• Recording can be done free with your own 
equipment 
What has changed?
• More affordable high-speed internet 
connections
• No longer need to tour the country and go 
broke to get people to know who you are
• No geographical limitations, you can live 
pretty much anywhere
Independent Music Production
The Future
• Levels the playing field
• No longer who you know, it is how good you 
are
• Artists retain rights to their material
• No formulas or templates to apply
• More variety
• Less competition between groups
What do I need for my studio?
Depends on the type of music you want to 
record
• For electronic music you may just need a 
solid computer, software of choice, good 
sound card, and some studio monitors
• For recording instruments, vocals, or bands 
you may need a few additional pieces like, 
mixer, i/o box, and microphones
• Some systems bundle these together
Computer Recommendations
• Check the software and hardware vendor’s 
site for recommended configurations
• No less than 512mb of RAM
• Dedicated secondary hard drive
• CD burner
• Over 2Ghz processor
• No anti-virus or anything else that constantly 
runs in the background
Computer Recommendations
• No or carefully screen internet connections ( 
remember no anti-virus? :^)
• Updated drivers
• Enable DMA on hard disks 
• The faster the hard disk spins the better
• Change role of computer to network server
Sound Card Recommendations
• M-Audio Audiophile 24/96 – Very solid and 
cheap $149.99
• AudioTrak Maya44 MKII - $199.99
• RME Audio Digi 96/8 – $399.99
Sound card considerations

Studio Monitor Considerations
• Near field reference
• Bigger the speaker is, the better the bass
• You usually listen to the music from approx. 
3 feet away
• Your ears will adjust to the monitors
• Active (the power amp is built into the 
monitor. Reduces noise and interference)
Microphones
For vocals
• AKG SolidTube – $799.99 (must be fairly 
strong vocalist)
• Neumann TLM 103 – $749.99
• Some fairly decent condenser mics can be 
found as cheap as $150 but you need a good 
pre-amp to make them sound decent
Microphones
For instruments and drums
• Anything by Shure and AKG
• Condenser mic for instruments like acoustic 
guitars
• When recording drums it is good practice to 
use two condenser mics as overheads on the 
left and right of the drum kit
• It is not uncommon to use 10 or more mics 
when recording drums
Guitars and Bass
• Line 6 PODxt – Amp Modeler
• Line 6 Bass PODxt – Amp Modeler
• Shure SM57 microphone – for mic’ing guitar 
cabinets
• Condenser microphone for mic’ing bass 
cabinets
Microphones
Drums
• You can usually buy a pre-packaged drum 
mic kit for $199 and up
• Sometimes you get what you pay for
• Pro Tools Sound Replacer – can be an 
invaluable tool in fixing drum sound issues
Software recommendations 
• Propellerheads Reason – for electronic music 
creation and beat production
• Acid – for remixing and some VST instruments
• Cubase SX – electronic music creation and VST 
instruments
• Digidesign Pro Tools – The defacto standard in 
audio recording and editing
• WaveLab – Wave file manipulation and audio 
mastering
What do these people do?
• Engineer – Usually the person who gets stuff ready 
to record and tracks the recording
• Mixing engineer – Person who equalizes and puts 
the levels in the right place
• Mastering engineer – Person who takes the product 
of mixing and puts the finishing touches on the final 
two stereo WAVs
• Producer – Person who makes sure everything 
sounds the way it should from start to finish
Problems with Indie System
• Advertising and promotions
• Misconceptions
• No rating system (mostly peer review)
• No good, standard way to collect money for 
plays of your song
Independent Artist Tips
• Have a good web site
• Present yourself well
• Present yourself bigger than you are
• Communicate and create friendships with 
other independent artists
• Create independent musical networks
• Know where you are and what you need to 
do to improve
Tips for the Producer
• Don’t get frustrated (a lot of trial and error)
• Remember it is always easier to add than to 
take away
• Listen to mixes on many different systems at 
the very least a car, home stereo, computer 
and a boom box
• Get accustomed to your monitors
• Listen in a realistic environment
Tips for the Producer
• Your ears can deceive you
• Listen to good recordings of instruments that 
you are getting ready to track
• Something may sound like crap on its own, 
but sound good in the mix
• Layer your instruments
• Create stereo effects by recording two tracks 
of the same audio and panning one all the 
way left and the other all the way right
Tips for the Producer
• Don’t be afraid to experiment
• Be mindful of effects that make your music 
sound dated, unless that is your goal
• Clean, punchy, and equalized right to the 
edge will give your recording a modern feel
• Learn what each EQ range sounds like and 
know what your track is missing
