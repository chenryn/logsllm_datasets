User: What would be the best practice in this scenario?
I have an App Engine Python app, with multiple cron jobs. Instantiated by user requests and cron jobs, push notifications might be sent. This could easily scale up to a total of +- 100 pushes per minute.
Setting up and tearing down a connection to APNs for every batch is not what I want. Neither is Apple advising to do this. So I would like to keep the connection alive, even when user requests finish or when a cron finishes. Possibly with a timeout (2 minutes no pushes, then close then connection).
Reading the GAE documentation, I couldn't figure out if there even is such a thing available. Also, I might need this to be available in different apps and/or modules.
Assistant: You can put the messages in a pull taskqueue and have a backend instance (or a cron job) to process the tasks
