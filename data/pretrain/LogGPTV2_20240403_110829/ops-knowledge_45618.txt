User: For a large web application, how to determine its system architecture to ensure high availability and scalability?
Assistant: Here are some steps to determine the system architecture of a large-scale web application: 1. Define business requirements: For any application, you first need to define its business requirements. Determine if it's an e-commerce site, or a social media application, or an online game, etc. 2. Determine performance requirements: How many requests does the application need to sustain? How many users are expected to access the application concurrently? This information can help determine the hardware configuration required for your system. 3. Design the server infrastructure: For web applications, the server infrastructure must ensure proper scalability and high availability. Therefore, choose a suitable technology model such as cloud computing, load balancing and containerization, etc. to ensure that the application is always reliable and highly available. 4. Select the database: Selecting the appropriate database is critical to the scalability and high availability of the application. NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB) and relational databases (such as MySQL) require design considerations in different situations. 5. Choose the right web server software: Choose a web server that can respond to requests quickly, is highly scalable, and reliable. 6. Perform automated testing: Testing is critical to maintaining software quality. Monitor metrics such as network requests, response times, CPU usage, and disk space to ensure application reliability and scalability at all times. 7. Design a reliable backup and fault tolerance mechanism: To ensure high availability of applications, automatic fault tolerance and data backup capabilities must be available. All in all, determining the complete system architecture can help you understand the implicit requirements of the application and its individual components on your team, and ensure that potential scalability and availability issues are addressed early in the system design.
