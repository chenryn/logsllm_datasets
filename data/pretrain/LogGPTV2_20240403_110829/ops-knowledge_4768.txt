User: How to use AWS EC2 and S3 service to host website? Please provide specific steps and configuration examples.
Assistant: The following are the specific operation steps and configuration examples of using AWS EC2 and S3 services to host the website: 1. Create an EC2 instance: First, you need to create an EC2 instance on AWS to host the website. You can choose basic configurations such as AMI, instance type, VPC, security group, etc. 2. Install a web server: Install a web server, such as Apache or Nginx, on the EC2 instance. 3. Set up the web server: Configure the web server, such as setting virtual hosts, HTTPS certificates, etc. 4. Add AWS S3 bucket: Create an S3 bucket to store website files. In the storage bucket configuration, you need to enable the static website hosting function, and select the default document and error document. 5. Configure the S3 bucket policy: Add a public read policy for the S3 bucket so that the web server can obtain files in the S3 bucket. 6. Upload website files to the S3 storage bucket: Upload the website files to the S3 storage bucket. 7. Configure the web server to access the S3 storage bucket: Configure the access permission of the S3 storage bucket on the web server so that the files in the S3 storage bucket can be accessed on the web server. This usually requires configuring the AWS SDK or S3 Fuse. 8. Configure DNS resolution: resolve the domain name to the public IP address of the EC2 instance. 9. Deploy the website: Deploy the website on the EC2 instance and confirm that the website can be accessed through the domain name. Other considerations: - When using an S3 storage bucket for hosting, in order to reduce the cost of network transmission, you can use CloudFront or other CDN services. - When using an S3 bucket for hosting, you need to upgrade the access permissions of the S3 bucket to avoid the security issue of only granting public read permissions at the bucket level. AWS provides a variety of policies and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to restrict access to bucket objects and actions. - When using S3 buckets for hosting, implement repository inventory to enhance risk management when performing manual or automated patching, making operations easier. The warehouse inventory is the most comprehensive data inventory that lists all objects in an S3 bucket and provides important metadata and other attributes.
