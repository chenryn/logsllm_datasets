Shifting the Focus of 
WiFi Security:
Beyond cracking your 
neighbor's wep key
Who are we and why do you care?

DISCLAIMER:
Some of the topics in this presentation 
may be used to break the law in new and 
exciting ways…
of course we do not recommend breaking 
the law and it is your responsibility to 
check your local laws and abide by them.
DO NOT blame us when a three letter 
organization knocks on your door.
History of WEP Attacks / Why it doesn’t work
 Passively Sniff for a long time
Slow, not enough data, impatient
No more weak ivs
 Replay/Injection Attacks
Fast but very noisy
Simple signatures
AP features that try to block (PSPF)
History of WPA Attacks / Why it doesn’t work
 Pre-shared key
Requires catching both sides of a quick 
handshake
Must be in range of client and AP
 Enterprise
Nearly impossible to crack passively
Most EAP types are difficult (at best) to MiTM
The Well Guarded Door
 Nearly 100% of attacks focus on the AP
 APs are getting more and more secure
 New features built into AP
PSPF / Client Isolation
Strong Authentication / Encryption
Lightweight controller based architecture
 APs are no longer the unguarded back door
Well deployed with for thought for security
Well developed industry best practices
Take the Path of Least Resistance
Attack the Clients!
 Tools have slowly appeared recently
 Difficult to use
 Odd requirements to make function
Attacking Client WEP Key
 Wep0ff
 Caffe-Latte
 Caffe-Latte Frag
Attacking Client WPA Key
 WPA-PSK
No public implementation
 WPA-ENT
Freeradius-wpe (thanks Brad and Josh!)
Requires hardware AP
Attacking the Client
 Many Separate Tools
 Difficult to configure
 Typically sparsely documented
 Odd requirements and configurations
Until now…
Introducing Airbase-ng
 Merges many tools into one
 New and improved, simplified implementations
 Full monitor mode AP simulation, needs no 
extra hardware
 Easy, fast, deadly (to encryption keys at least)
Airbase-ng Demo
 Evil Twin / Honey Pot
 Karma
 WEP attacks
 WPA-PSK attacks
 WPA-Enterprise attacks (if completed in 
time)
What are you, a blackhat?
 No seriously, this doesn’t promise a win
 There are ways to defend as well
 APs are finally being configured securely, 
now clients must be as well
Simple Defenses
 Proper Secure Client Configurations
 Check the right boxes
 GPO
 (Still in process of completing this section, 
please download final slides from link at 
the end of presentation)
Beyond the Basics
 Wireless Intrusion Detection and Prevention
 Systems designed to detect attacks and 
sometimes even prevent them
 (Full explanation of WIPS systems and 
features will follow, with no vendor bashing, 
however Rick is still gaining permissions 
required by his employer so this section will be 
left uncompleted for now)
A Step Beyond Crazy
 WiFi Frequencies
.11b/g 2412-2462 (US)
.11a 5180-5320, 5745-5825 (US)
 Does this look odd to anyone else?
Licensed Bands
 Some vendors carry licensed radios
 Special wifi cards for use by military and 
public safety
 Typically expensive
 Requires a license to even purchase
 Frequencies of 4920 seem surprisingly 
close to 5180
Can we do this cheaper?
 Atheros and others sometimes support 
more channels
 Allows for 1 radio to be sold for many 
purposes.
 Software controls allowed freqencies
Who Controls the Software?
 Sadly, typically the chipset vendors
 Most wifi drivers in linux require binary 
firmware
 This firmware controls regulatory 
compliance as well as purposing
What can we do?
 Fortunately, most linux users don’t like 
closed source binaries
 For many reasons, fully open sourced 
drivers are being developed
 As these drivers become stable, we can 
start to play
Let’s Play…
 Madwifi-ng is driven by a binary HAL
 Ath5k is the next gen fully open source 
driver
 Kugutsumen released a patch for 
“DEBUG” regdomain
 Allows for all supported channels to be 
tuned to
New Toys
 Yesterday
.11b/g 2412-2462 (US)
.11a 5180-5320, 5745-5825 (US)
 Today
.11a 4920-6100 (DEBUG)
What to do now?
 What is on this new frequencies?
(insert full image of frequency map)
 But does it really work?
Spectrum Analyzer Demo
 Fully tested frequencies
(finish complete testing)
 Warning: This may differ from card to card
Limitations
 Many real licensed implementations are broken
 Card reports channel 1 but is actually on 
4920MHz
 This is done to make is easy to use existing 
drivers
 This breaks many open source applications
Airodump-ng
 Airodump-ng now supports a list of 
frequencies to scan rather than channels
 Only channels are shown in display, may 
be wrong
 Strips vital header information off of packet 
so data saved from extended channels is 
useless
Kismet
 At time of writing is unable to handle most 
of the extended channels
 Displays channels not frequencies
 Does save usable pcap files
Improvement Needed
 Sniffers are two trusting, they believe what 
they see
 Never intended to deal with oddly broken 
implementations such as channel number 
fudging
 Sniffers need to be improved to report 
more reality, and less assumptions
Final Thoughts
 Remember everyone here is a white hat
 Please use your new found knowledge for 
good not evil
 In the United States it is LEGAL to monitor 
all radio frequencies (except those used 
by cell phone)
 Have fun…
Thanks
