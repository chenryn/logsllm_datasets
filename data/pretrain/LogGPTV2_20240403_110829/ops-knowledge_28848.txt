User: Please explain what operating system memory management is, list several common memory management techniques, and compare and analyze them.
Assistant: Operating system memory management refers to the process by which the operating system effectively manages and utilizes the memory resources in the computer system. Its main purpose is to divide memory resources into multiple different areas, so that each application program can run in its own independent space, thereby avoiding conflicts and interference between programs, and improving the stability, security and reliability of the computer system . The following are several common memory management techniques: 1. Segmented management: Divide the memory into different logical segments, and each segment can be assigned to a program or module, so as to achieve isolation and protection among program modules. But because each program has its own independent address space, it is not conducive to data sharing between processes. 2. Paging management: Divide the memory into pages of equal size, which can be used by different programs, and provide a better memory protection and sharing mechanism. However, address translation is required, which will increase the time overhead of accessing memory. 3. Segmented page management: It is a combination of segmented and paging, which enables programs to share the required common code and data while protecting the isolation between programs. However, the implementation complexity is high and requires a lot of hardware support. 4. Partner system: used to manage variable-sized memory space, which divides the memory space into blocks of equal size, and each block is allocated to the process as a free partner. The buddy system is simple to implement, but because of the need for splitting and merging operations, there will be memory fragmentation problems. Different memory management technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages, and need to be selected according to the specific operating environment and requirements. At present, segment page management is the mainstream memory management technology. It not only has the advantages of segmentation and paging, but also solves the shortcomings of these two technologies, so it is widely used in the implementation of operating systems.
