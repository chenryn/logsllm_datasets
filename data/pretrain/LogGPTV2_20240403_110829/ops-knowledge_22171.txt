User: I just started using Google App Engine and I am very new to Python. I may have made a stupid mistake or a fatal error, I don't know, but I realized that the basic "template" I downloaded from a website was old and used Python 2.5.
So, I decided to update to Python 2.7 (after recieving a warning in the site's dashboard).
I have no idea how to do this, but I blindly followed some instructions on how to update but I'm not sure what I did wrong.
I know that I downloaded Python 2.7 (as the download path is C:/Python27/), so there shouldn't be a problem there. Can anybody tell what I'm doing wrong?
Assistant: I'm submitting as an answer because I'm relatively new to SO and don't have enough rep to comment, so sorry about that... But line 7 of your new main.py uses webapp instead of webapp2, so that may be causing some troubles, but likely isn't the reason that it's not working. Could you also provide the contact.html template?
