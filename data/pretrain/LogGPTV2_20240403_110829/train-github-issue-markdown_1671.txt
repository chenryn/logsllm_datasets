I want to have a cache class which clears itself. Since the both annotations
are not working together I have to create a special task class.  
The problem is that the cache class is a proxy and then the scheduler runs
into a ClassCastException.
Perhaps it is no real bug. For me it is.  
It is also possible that is already a known issue without any possible
solution.
Desired syntax would be something like that:
`@Scheduled`(fixedDelay=50000)  
`@CacheEvict`(value = "country", allEntries=true)  
public void clearCache() {  
//only clear cache;  
}
