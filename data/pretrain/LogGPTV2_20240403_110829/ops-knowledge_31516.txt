User: I am confused to use about these two osmethods to create the new directory.
Please give me some example in Python.
Assistant: makedirs : Recursive directory creation function. Like mkdir(), but makes all intermediate-level directories needed to contain the leaf directory. Raises an error exception if the leaf directory already exists or cannot be created.
