### Optimized Text

The optimal sage length is half the total number of exploit symbols, or \(2^{n-1}\). Therefore, the message length is set to 128 bits.

Based on these design decisions, the system metrics can be predicted. Figure 10 illustrates the predicted probability of detection and reliability as a function of the exploit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The operational SNR is defined as the crossover point between detectability and reliability. From the graph, this crossover point is determined to be 0.045, where the probability of channel detection is estimated to be 0.81% and the bit error rate (BER) is estimated to be 0.36%.

With an operational SNR of 0.045, the sending host injects exploit symbols at a rate of 45 per 1000 naturally occurring exploit symbols. The natural occurrence rate of exploit symbols, \(\nu_s\), is 8.39%. Therefore, the overall injection rate becomes 0.00378. This implies that a symbol injector should release signals (symbols) into the background traffic at a rate of about 38 per 10,000 packets. Using Equation 5, the optimal sample size for the warden is given by:

\[ N_o = \left\lceil \frac{L}{\nu_s \cdot S N R_o} \right\rceil \approx 33,900 \text{ symbols (packets)} \]

### Message Length Validation
The system is validated by transmitting arbitrary messages across the channel and comparing the empirical results with the predicted ones.

### Exploit Field Selection
For the experiment, the 16-bit packet size field of a link layer protocol implementation for encrypted wireless data was chosen. Figure 9 depicts the occurrences of each packet size value over approximately 40 minutes of outbound traffic from a single host, recording around 35,000 total packets.

An analysis of the packet size data reveals about 260 good candidate packet sizes for use as exploit symbols. The probability of occurrence for each symbol ranges from 0.000266 to 0.000387, with an average of 0.000328. The resultant covert channel is characterized by symbol insertions as the predominant error type.

### Code Selection
The selection of an appropriate code is guided by the total available candidate exploit symbols. Ideally, the code should be designed to handle high numbers of symbol insertion errors. The Square Toroid of Octagons code is used to encode the message. A channel modulator maps the encoder outputs (code symbols) one-to-one onto the chosen exploit symbols. A symbol injector releases one signal for roughly every 263 packets of background traffic.

At the receiver, a channel demodulator extracts only those received packets containing exploit symbols, i.e., those with packet size values from the exploit symbol set. A channel decoder then takes the sequence of exploit symbols and decodes it until it finds a message of length 128 bits, which is a shared secret between the sender and receiver.

### Experimental Results
The experiment was run 100 times. The empirical reliability was computed as the total number of bits decoded correctly over the total number of bits decoded. The observed BER was 0.25%. To confirm the probability of detection, the observed number of each exploit symbol was recorded and compared to the upper control limit (UCL) from Equation 5. If any exploit symbol count exceeded the UCL, it was considered an indicator of detection. Over the 100 trials, no detections were observed. The maximum counts of any exploit symbol ranged from 17 to 20, with 65% of the time the highest count being 18, well below the UCL limit of 21.

### Conclusion
A unique design methodology for network-based covert communication systems has been proposed. A quantitative measure of the probability of detection has been developed for a generic storage-based network covert channel. A general methodology for designing error-correcting codes for high numbers of symbol insertion errors has been demonstrated, and a family of such codes has been developed. A general expression for the reliability of these codes has also been derived. The system design experiment demonstrated the feasibility and predictability of the approach; the BER was predicted to be 0.36% but observed to be 0.25%, and the detectability was predicted to be 0.81% but observed to be 0%.

An expression for the efficiency (or throughput) of the system has also been derived. The experimental design yields a low system efficiency, with at most one bit of message transmitted in each packet sent. Higher efficiency exploits and codes are currently being pursued. Extensions to trellis codes to support extremely low levels of SNR are being investigated, and techniques for detecting these types of channels are also being explored.
