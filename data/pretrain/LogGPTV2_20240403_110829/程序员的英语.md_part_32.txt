白宫眼中的网络安全
WhiteHouseonCybersecurity
 hrough its website, the white House describes various issues
affecting the country and outlines plans for acldressing them. This is
what the White House says about Cybersecurity and Internet Policy [1].
Cybersecurity and Internet Policy
President Obama has pledged to preserve the free and open nature of
the Internet to encourage innovation, protect consumer choice, and
defend free speech. The Administration has created an Internet Policy
Task Force to bring together industry, consumer groups, and policy
experts to identify ways of ensuring that the Internet remains a reliable
and trustworthy resource for consumers and businesses.
In July 2011, at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the Obama Administration joined with
representatives from business, civil society, and Internet technical
communities from 34 countries to reaffirm the importance of Internet
 policy principles that have enabled the open Internet to flourish with
innovation and human connections beyond our wildest expectations.
Americans deserve an Internet that is safe and secure, so they can shop,
bank, communicate, and learn online without fear their accounts will
be hacked or their identity stolen. President Obama has declared that
the °cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national
security challenges we face as a nationa and that *America’s economic

prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity.° To help the
country meet this challenge and to ensure the Internet can continue as
an engine of growth and prosperity, the Administration is implementing
the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace. The
Administration also released the International Strategy for Cyberspace
to promote the free flow of information, the security and privacy of data
and the integrity of the interconnccted networks, which are all essential
to American and global economic prosperity and security.
President Obama has responded to Congress’ call for input on the cyber
security legislation that our Nation needs, and the Acdministration will
continue to engage with Congress as it moves forwarcl.
The Obama Administration has also prioritized the cybersecurity of
federal departments and agencies. In addition, the Administration has
matured the government's implementation of the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) away from a static, paper-based
process to a dynamic, relevant process based upon continuous
monitoring and risk assessment,
"We have to do everything we can to encourage the entrepreneurial
spirit, wherever we find it. We should be helping American
companies compete and sell their products all over the world.
We should be making it easier and faster to turn new ideas into
new jobs and new businesses. And we should knock down any
barriers that stand in the way. Because if we’re going to create
jobs now and in the future, we're going to have to out-build and
out-educate and out-innovate every other country on Earth.
-PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, SEPTEMBER 16, 2011
