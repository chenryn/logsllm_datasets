suspicious node as a result of a false positive of the intru-
sion detection system is thus 1 − E. F is consequently the
risk appetite distribution function and depends on the ac-
curacy of the underlying intrusion detection system. We will
investigate our game in light of diﬀerent characteristics of the
intrusion detection functions in Section 6.4.
A node proﬁts if it revokes a suspicious node, and if the
risk that it ﬁnally took was less then its original risk appetite.
Consequently, the proﬁt in our karmic-suicide game is ’risk
appetite ’ − ’risk taken’. The proﬁt can also be interpreted
as the diﬀerence between the expectation value E (gained
certainty) and a node’s originally desired assurance that they
will make the correct decision, i.e. E − ci.
As both value and price in our Dutch auction need to be
drawn from the interval [0, 1], 1 − E, and thus E, must also
be a value between 0 and 1. We therefore restrict our anal-
ysis to the interval E ∈ [0, 1]. As per our deﬁnition of the
expectation value in Equation 1, the accuracy requirement of
our IDS in a karmic-suicide game must lie between 0.5 and 1.
6.4 Inﬂuence of the Supporting IDS
Up until now we have shown how our karmic-suicide game
can be modeled as a Dutch auction. However, we have not yet
systematically explored the distribution function F . Recall
that in Section 6.3, we saw that F is the probability distri-
bution function for a node’s risk appetite, i.e. Fi(v) denotes
the probability that Pi’s risk appetite is less than or equal to
v. For example, if we assume that node Pi chooses their risk
appetite uniformly distributed in [0, 1], then Fi(v) = v.
We deﬁne F as a function of the accuracy of the intrusion
detection system. We will investigate our game applied to two
intrusion detection systems (note: we are only interested in a
qualitative deﬁnition of the IDS’s accuracy, since quantitative
values vary with each IDS). Our functions for representing an
IDS’s accuracy, takes as input the number of rounds r (see
Section 4.1) and returns the probability 1 − eni(r) that the
IDS from node i correctly identiﬁes the misbehaving node.
To determine F , it is necessary to deﬁne the distribution of
r. Since we assume each round to represent a time interval
of similar length, r is uniformly distributed.
Our ﬁrst IDS function is artiﬁcially simple to allow easier
insight into later calculations and results. It is deﬁned by:
1 − eni(r) = r/100, r ∈ [50, 100] ⊂ N
(2)
where r ≥ 50 follows from ids ≥ 0.5 and the game is played
for r = 100 rounds.
As Fi(v) is the probability that Pi’s risk appetite, 1 − Ei
≤ v, F can be expressed as (see Appendix A for proof):
Fi(v) = v
(3)
Our second IDS accuracy function, F , is representative of
real IDS functions. That is, it is impossible to determine with
complete certainty that a node is malicious (see Equation 4).
The closer to 1 the probability is to detect a malicious node,
the more evidence (number of rounds) is required to push the
probability closer to complete certainty. Figure 9(b) shows
the graph of this IDS function for q = 0.03. The design
of the function can be explained as follows: Each round of
malicious behavior proofs the suspicious node to be hostile
with a probability of q. After a certain number of rounds, r,
the probability to not prove a malicious node’s aﬃliations is
(1−q)r. Consequently the IDS’s accuracy can be expressed by
Equation 4. Since we only want to give a qualitative analysis
of an IDS’s inﬂuence, a concrete choice of q does not inﬂuence
our results.
1 − eni(r) = 1 − (1 − q)

The risk appetite distribution function F that results from
this IDS function is:

6.5 Equilibria
In a Dutch auction each bidder has the single decision to
make, at what price should he bid. A Dutch auction has ex-
actly one equilibrium which can be interpreted as the bidders
best decision [8]:

common distribution, F , then bidding when the price reaches

constitutes a symmetric Nash equilibrium of a Dutch auction.
We can now calculate the equilibrium for both of our dis-
tribution functions F from Section 6.4. For our simple IDS as
deﬁned by Equation 2, with distribution function F (v) = v,
the equilibrium is given by (see Appendix A for proof):
ˆb(v) = v − v
N
(7)
The resulting equilibrium for our second IDS, as deﬁned in
Equation 4, cannot be expressed in a closed-form expression,
but needs to be calculated for each input value separately.
The graph in Figure 10(b) shows a plot of this equilibrium
for N = 2, 5, 10. Accordingly, the equilibrium from Equation
7 is plotted in Figure 10(a) for N = 2, 5, 10.
6.6 Results
The equilibria from Section 6.5 allows us to analyze both
the revocation behavior of honest nodes as well as the agility
(speed at which our scheme reacts to malicious behavior) of
our karmic-suicide scheme. We begin with an analysis of the
equilibria for both IDS functions and conclude with an exam-
ination of the agility of our revocation scheme.
Figure 10 shows the equilibria for both IDS functions for
diﬀerent number of honest nodes N = 2, 5, 10, where each
node competes for the potential reward by revoking a sus-
pected malicious node. The graph F in these ﬁgures shows
the risk appetite distribution function; where F (v) is the
probability that a node chooses a risk appetite value less than
or equal to v. This function is the key for calculating the equi-
libria for Equation 6.

Figure 11: Probability that a ma-
licious node is revoked.
Both Figures 10(a) and 10(b) illustrate the tendency of
nodes to adopt risk seeking behavior if the number of com-
petitors, N , is large. A node that accepts a risk (1− ci) of 0.5
in Figure 10(a) will, in the presence of a single competitor
(N = 2), not revoke a node before the actual risk (1 − E)
falls below 0.25.
If this node is the ﬁrst one to revoke the
suspect node, it will have (on average) a proﬁt of 0.25. This
means that their expectation value, as deﬁned in Equation 1,
exceeds their minimally desired expectation value (certainty
level ci) by 0.25. As the number of competitors to revoke the
suspect in this scenario increases to N = 5 and N = 10, the
nodes will increase their willingness to take a higher risk. Fig-
ure 10(b) shows similar results as Figure 10(a). However, the
major diﬀerence is that for the asymptotic IDS system, the
nodes take lower risks. Even if a node has a maximum risk
appetite of 1 and 4 competitors (N = 5), an honest node will
wait to revoke a suspected malicious node until its risk is ap-
proximately 0.6. As our results in Figure 11 show, this small
willingness to take a risk signiﬁcantly decreases the agility of
the revocation scheme for for a small number of competitors.
The results from Figure 10 show that our karmic-suicide
scheme gives honest nodes an incentive to revoke a poten-
tially malicious node, if their IDS provides suﬃciently accu-
rate information. Based on the accuracy of the IDS we will
now examine the agility of our karmic-suicide scheme, i.e. see
what amount of evidence is required for a malicious node to
be revoked by an honest node.
To this end, we calculate the probability that after a certain
number of rounds, r, at least one of the honest nodes will
revoke the suspected malicious node. As shown in Appendix
A, the probability that at least one of N competing nodes
revoked the malicious node after a certain number of rounds
r is:
