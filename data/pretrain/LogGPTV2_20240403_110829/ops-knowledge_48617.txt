User:  How to securely access a Linux host remotely?
Assistant: 1. Use SSH protocol: SSH is a secure remote access protocol, which can encrypt data transmission and prevent hackers from monitoring and tampering. By using an SSH client, it is possible to enter commands on a remote computer and manage a Linux server. 2. Disable remote root login: The highest authority to manage a Linux server is usually the root user. Disabling remote root logins can protect the system from hackers. You can create an unprivileged user and then use the sudo command to elevate privileges. 3. Use a firewall: Installing and configuring a firewall can protect the Linux server from unauthorized access and only allow legitimate data to flow in and out. 4. Use a VPN connection: You can safely access remote network resources, including Linux hosts. Creating a VPN connection requires a VPN client and a VPN server. This service needs to be configured. 5. Use security protocols (TLS/SSL): Using security protocols such as TLS/SSL can protect sensitive data from remote access to Linux hosts, ensuring that data is protected during transmission. Usually OpenSSL or GnuTLS are used to implement these functions.
