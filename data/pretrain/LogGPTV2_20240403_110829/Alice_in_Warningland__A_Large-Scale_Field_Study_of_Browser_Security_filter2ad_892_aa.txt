### Abstract
We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of browser security warnings, challenging the common belief and previous research that such warnings are generally ineffective. Using in-browser telemetry from Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, we observed over 25 million warning impressions in situ. Our findings show that users continued through 10% of Mozilla Firefox’s malware and phishing warnings, 25% of Google Chrome’s malware and phishing warnings, and 33% of Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This indicates that security warnings can be effective in practice, and security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. Additionally, user behavior varies across different types of warnings. For instance, users continued through 70.2% of Google Chrome’s SSL warnings, highlighting the significant impact of the user experience on behavior. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for warning designers and researchers.

### 1. Introduction
A widely held view in the security community is that relying on end users to make security decisions is futile. Felten and McGraw famously stated, "Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, the user will pick dancing pigs every time [21]." Herley further elaborated, noting that users often neglect even basic security precautions, such as ignoring certificate error warnings and failing to distinguish legitimate websites from phishing imitations [17].

The perception of the "oblivious" user has been shaped by several laboratory studies on browser security indicators [5, 11, 13, 15, 27, 31, 35]. However, these studies may not accurately represent the current state of browser warnings. Most of the evaluated warnings have been deprecated or significantly modified, often in response to the criticisms raised in these studies. Our goal is to investigate whether modern browser security warnings effectively protect users in practice.

### 2. Background

#### 2.1 Malware and Phishing Warnings
Malware and phishing warnings aim to prevent users from visiting malicious websites. Both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox use the Google Safe Browsing list [26] to identify such sites. The browsers warn users instead of blocking the sites outright because the Safe Browsing service occasionally produces false positives, although at a very low rate [26].

**Clickthrough Rate:** If a malware or phishing warning is a true positive, clicking through exposes the user to a dangerous situation. Since nearly all Safe Browsing warnings are true positives, the ideal clickthrough rate for these warnings is close to 0%.

**Warning Mechanisms:** The browsers regularly fetch a list of suspicious (malware or phishing) sites from Safe Browsing servers. If a user attempts to visit a site on this list, the browser checks with the Safe Browsing service to confirm the URL's status. If the site is still on the list, the browser presents a warning.

Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox handle third-party resources differently. Google Chrome stops the page load and replaces it with a warning if a third-party resource is from a URL on the Safe Browsing list. Mozilla Firefox blocks the third-party resource without a warning, potentially resulting in fewer warnings for users despite using the same Safe Browsing list.

**Click Count:** To bypass the warning in Mozilla Firefox, users need to click one button: "Ignore this warning." In Google Chrome, users must click twice: first on "Advanced," then on "Proceed at your own risk."

#### 2.2 SSL Warnings
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) protocol provides secure channels between browsers and web servers, ensuring user security and privacy. The browser verifies the server's identity by validating its public-key certificate against trusted root authorities. This validation fails in the presence of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack but can also fail due to benign scenarios like server misconfigurations.

**Clickthrough Rate:** We aim for a 0% clickthrough rate for SSL warnings during MITM attacks. However, many SSL warnings may be false positives (e.g., server misconfigurations). There are two views on handling false positives: either discourage users from clicking through both true and false positives to incentivize developers to get valid SSL certificates, or provide users with enough information to correctly identify and dismiss false positives. In either case, the desired clickthrough rates for false-positive warnings would be 0% and 100%, respectively. False positives are undesirable as they annoy users with invalid warnings. Our goal is a 0% clickthrough rate for all SSL warnings: users should heed all valid warnings, and the browser should minimize false positives.

**Warning Design:** Figures 3 and 4 show the SSL warnings for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Users can leave via the warning’s escape button, manually navigate away, or click through the warning. In Mozilla Firefox, users must also click through a second dialog (Figure 5) to bypass the warning.

**Click Count:** To bypass the SSL warning in Google Chrome, users need to click once. In Mozilla Firefox, users must click three times: (1) "I Understand The Risks," (2) "Add Exception," and (3) "Confirm Security Exception" in the second dialog. By default, Firefox remembers the exception and does not show the warning again for the same certificate. In contrast, Chrome presents the warning every time and does not remember past choices.

#### 2.3 Browser Release Channels
Both Mozilla and Google follow rapid release cycles, releasing official versions of their browsers every six to seven weeks, with automatic updates. The default version is referred to as "stable" (Google Chrome) or "release" (Mozilla Firefox). Users interested in testing pre-release versions can switch to different channels, such as "Beta," "developer" (Google Chrome), "Aurora" (Mozilla Firefox), "nightly" (Mozilla Firefox), or "Canary" (Google Chrome). These pre-release channels are intended for advanced users and developers, who can test new features before they are deployed to end users. The rest of this paper assumes a positive correlation between pre-release channel use and technical ability.

### 3. Prior Laboratory Studies
We review prior laboratory studies on SSL and phishing warnings, which generally paint a grim picture of browser security warnings. However, most of these warnings have since been deprecated or modified. Only two studies evaluated warnings similar to the modern (June 2013) browser warnings we study in this paper.

**Sunshine et al. and Sotirakopoulos et al.** reported clickthrough rates of 55% to 80% for the Firefox 3 and 3.5 SSL warnings, which are similar but not identical to the current Firefox SSL warning [30, 31]. Sotirakopoulos et al. concluded that laboratory biases inflated the clickthrough rates [30].

**Dhamija et al.** conducted the first laboratory study of SSL warnings in 2006, finding that 68% of participants quickly clicked through the warning without reading it [11].

**Schechter et al.** studied user reactions to Internet Explorer 7’s SSL warning, reporting that 53% of participants clicked through, with a statistically significant difference between role-playing and non-role-playing groups [27].

**Bravo-Lillo et al.** interviewed participants about an SSL warning, finding that "advanced" participants were less likely to click through than "novice" participants [5].

**Passive Indicators:** Some studies focused on passive SSL indicators, which non-interruptively show the status of the HTTP(S) connection in the browser UI. Although browsers still have passive SSL indicators, interruptive SSL and phishing warnings are now the primary tool for communicating security information to users.

### 4. Contributions
- **First Large-Scale Field Study:** To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth, large-scale field study of browser security warnings.
- **Comparison with Prior Research:** We survey prior laboratory studies and discuss how our field study data differs from previous research.
- **Demographic Analysis:** We analyze how demographics (operating system and browser channel), warning frequency, and warning complexity affect user decisions. Notably, technically skilled users ignore warnings more often, and warning frequency is inversely correlated with user attention.
- **Recommendations:** We provide suggestions for browser warning designers and make recommendations for future studies.

### 5. Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that browser security warnings can be effective in practice, and user behavior varies significantly across different types of warnings. The user experience of a warning has a substantial impact on user behavior. Therefore, security experts and platform designers should not dismiss the role of the user in making security decisions. Efforts to build usable and effective warnings are justified and necessary.
