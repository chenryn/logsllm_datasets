Abstract
We empirically assess whether browser security warn-
ings are as ineffective as suggested by popular opinion
and previous literature. We used Mozilla Firefox and
Google Chrome’s in-browser telemetry to observe over
25 million warning impressions in situ. During our ﬁeld
study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Fire-
fox’s malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google
Chrome’s malware and phishing warnings, and a third of
Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This demonstrates that
security warnings can be effective in practice; security
experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal
of communicating security information to end users. We
also ﬁnd that user behavior varies across warnings. In con-
trast to the other warnings, users continued through 70.2%
of Google Chrome’s SSL warnings. This indicates that
the user experience of a warning can have a signiﬁcant
impact on user behavior. Based on our ﬁndings, we make
recommendations for warning designers and researchers.

Introduction
An oft-repeated maxim in the security community is the
futility of relying on end users to make security decisions.
Felten and McGraw famously wrote, “Given a choice
between dancing pigs and security, the user will pick
dancing pigs every time [21].” Herley elaborates [17],
Not only do users take no precautions against
elaborate attacks, they appear to neglect even
basic ones. For example, a growing body of
measurement studies make clear that ...[users]
are oblivious to security cues [27], ignore cer-
tiﬁcate error warnings [31] and cannot tell legit-
imate web-sites from phishing imitations [11].1
∗The Mozilla Firefox experiments were implemented while the au-
thor was an intern at Mozilla Corporation.

The security community’s perception of the “oblivious”
user evolved from the results of a number of laboratory
studies on browser security indicators [5, 11, 13, 15, 27,
31, 35]. However, these studies are not necessarily rep-
resentative of the current state of browser warnings in
2013. Most of the studies evaluated warnings that have
since been deprecated or signiﬁcantly modiﬁed, often in
response to criticisms in the aforementioned studies. Our
goal is to investigate whether modern browser security
warnings protect users in practice.
We performed a large-scale ﬁeld study of user deci-
sions after seeing browser security warnings. Our study
encompassed 25,405,944 warning impressions in Google
Chrome and Mozilla Firefox in May and June 2013. We
collected the data using the browsers’ telemetry frame-
works, which are a mechanism for browser vendors to
collect pseudonymous data from end users. Telemetry
allowed us to unobtrusively measure user behavior during
normal browsing activities. This design provides realism:
our data reﬂects users’ actual behavior when presented
with security warnings.
In this paper, we present the rates at which users click
through (i.e., bypass) malware, phishing, and SSL warn-
ings. Low clickthrough rates are desirable because they
indicate that users notice and heed the warnings. Click-
through rates for the two browsers’ malware and phish-
ing warnings ranged from 9% to 23%, and users clicked
through 33.0% of Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This
demonstrates that browser security warnings can effec-
tively protect most users in practice.
Unfortunately, users clicked through Google Chrome’s
SSL warning 70.2% of the time. This implies that the
user experience of a warning can have a signiﬁcant impact
on user behavior. We discuss several factors that might
contribute to this warning’s higher clickthrough rates. Our
positive ﬁndings for the other ﬁve warnings suggest that
the clickthrough rate for Google Chrome’s SSL warning
can be improved.

Figures 1 and 2 show the Google
Chrome and Mozilla Firefox warnings. Their phishing
warnings are similar to their respective malware warn-
ings. When a browser presents the user with a malware or
phishing warning, she has three options: leave the page
via the warning’s escape button, leave the page by closing
the window or typing a new URL, or click through the
warning and proceed to the page. The warnings also allow
the user to seek more information about the error.
Click Count. Mozilla Firefox users who want to bypass
the warning need to click one button: the “Ignore this
warning” link at the bottom right. On the other hand,
Chrome users who want to bypass the warning need to
click twice: ﬁrst on the “Advanced” link, and then on
“Proceed at your own risk.”
2.2 SSL Warnings
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) protocol provides
secure channels between browsers and web servers, mak-
ing it fundamental to user security and privacy on the
web. As a critical step, the browser veriﬁes a server’s
identity by validating its public-key certiﬁcate against a
set of trusted root authorities. This validation will fail in
the presence of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
Authentication failures can also occur in a wide vari-
ety of benign scenarios, such as server misconﬁgurations.
Browsers usually cannot distinguish these benign scenar-
ios from real MITM attacks. Instead, browsers present
users with a warning; users have the option to bypass the
warning, in case the warning is a false positive.
Clickthrough Rate. We hope for a 0% clickthrough rate
for SSL warnings shown during MITM attacks. However,
many SSL warnings may be false positives (e.g., server
misconﬁgurations). There are two competing views re-
garding SSL false positives. In the ﬁrst, warning text
should discourage users from clicking through both true
and false positives, in order to incentivize developers
to get valid SSL certiﬁcates. In the other, warning text
should provide users with enough information to correctly
identify and dismiss false positives. The desired click-
through rates for false-positive warnings would be 0%
and 100%, respectively. In either case, false positives are
undesirable for the user experience because we do not
want to annoy users with invalid warnings. Our goal is
therefore a 0% clickthrough rate for all SSL warnings:
users should heed all valid warnings, and the browser
should minimize the number of false positives.
Warning Design. Figures 3 and 4 present Google Chrome
and Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. The user can leave
via the warning’s escape button, manually navigate away,
or click through the warning. In Mozilla Firefox, the
user must also click through a second dialog (Figure 5) to
bypass the warning.
Figure 5: SSL Add Exception Dialog for Mozilla Firefox
We focus on three types of browser security warnings:
malware, phishing, and SSL warnings. At present, all
three types of warnings are full-page, interstitial warnings
that discourage the user from proceeding.
2.1 Malware and Phishing Warnings
Malware and phishing warnings aim to prevent users from
visiting websites that serve malicious executables or try
to trick users. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox rely
on the Google Safe Browsing list [26] to identify mal-
ware and phishing websites. The browsers warn users
away from the sites instead of blocking them because the
Safe Browsing service occasionally has false positives,
although the false positive rate is very low [26].
Clickthrough Rate. If a malware or phishing warning
is a true positive, clicking through exposes the user to a
dangerous situation. Nearly all Safe Browsing warnings
are true positives; the false positive rate is low enough
to be negligible. The ideal clickthrough rate for malware
and phishing warnings is therefore close to 0%.
Warning Mechanisms. The browsers routinely fetch a
list of suspicious (i.e., malware or phishing) sites from
Safe Browsing servers. If a user tries to visit a site that
is on the locally cached list, the browser checks with the
Safe Browsing service that the URL is still on the malware
or phishing list. If the site is still on one of the lists, the
browser presents a warning.
The two browsers behave differently if a page loads
a third-party resource (e.g., a script) from a URL on the
Safe Browsing list. Google Chrome stops the page load
and replaces the page with a warning. Mozilla Firefox
blocks the third-party resource with no warning. As a
result, Mozilla Firefox users can see fewer warnings than
Google Chrome users, despite both browsers using the
same Safe Browsing list.

22nd USENIX Security Symposium  259
The browsers differ in their presentation of the techni-
cal details of the error. Google Chrome places information
about the speciﬁc error in the main warning (Figure 3, ﬁrst
paragraph), whereas Firefox puts the error information
in the hidden “Technical Details” section and the second
“Add Exception” dialog (Figure 5).
Click Count. Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warning requires
more clicks to bypass. Google Chrome users click
through a single warning button to proceed. On the other
hand, Mozilla Firefox’s warning requires three clicks:
(1) click on “I Understand The Risks,” (2) click on the
“Add Exception” button, which raises a second dialog,
(3) click on “Conﬁrm Security Exception” in the second
dialog. By default, Firefox permanently remembers the
exception and will not show the warning again if the user
reencounters the same certiﬁcate for that website.
In
contrast, Chrome presents the warning every time and
does not remember the user’s past choices.
2.3 Browser Release Channels
Mozilla and Google both follow rapid release cycles.
They release ofﬁcial versions of their browsers every six
or seven weeks, and both browsers update automatically.
The ofﬁcial, default version of a browser is referred to as
“stable” (Google Chrome) or “release” (Mozilla Firefox).
If users are interested in testing pre-release browser
versions, they can switch to a different channel. The sta-
ble/release channel is the recommended channel for end
users, but a minority of users choose to use earlier chan-
nels to test cutting-edge features. The “Beta” channel is
several weeks ahead of the stable/release channel. The
“developer” (Google Chrome) or “Aurora” (Mozilla Fire-
fox) channel is delivered even earlier. Both browsers also
offer a “nightly” (Mozilla Firefox) or “Canary” (Google
Chrome) release channel, which updates every day and
closely follows the development repository.
The pre-release channels are intended for advanced
users who want to experience the latest-and-greatest fea-
tures and improvements. They give website, extension,
and add-on developers time to test their code on upcom-
ing versions before they are deployed to end users. The
early channels are not recommended for typical end users
because they can have stability issues, due to being un-
der active development. The rest of this paper assumes
a positive correlation between pre-release channels use
and technical ability. While this matches the intention
of browser developers, we did not carry out any study to
validate this assumption.
3 Prior Laboratory Studies
We survey prior laboratory studies of SSL and phishing
warnings. The body of literature paints a grim picture
of browser security warnings, but most of the warnings
have since been deprecated or modiﬁed. In some cases,
warnings were changed in response to these studies.
Only two studies evaluated warnings that are similar
to the modern (June 2013) browser warnings that we
study in this paper. Sunshine et al. and Sotirakopoulos
et al. reported clickthrough rates of 55% to 80% for the
Firefox 3 and 3.5 SSL warnings, which are similar but
not identical to the current Firefox SSL warning [30, 31].
However, Sotirakopoulos et al. concluded that laboratory
biases had inﬂated both studies’ clickthrough rates [30].
3.1 SSL Warnings
SSL warnings are the most studied type of browser warn-
ing. Usability researchers have evaluated SSL warnings
in both SSL-speciﬁc studies and phishing studies because
SSL warnings and passive indicators were once viewed
as a way to identify phishing attacks.2
Dhamija et al. performed the ﬁrst laboratory study of
SSL warnings in 2006. They challenged 22 study partic-
ipants to differentiate between phishing and legitimate
websites in Mozilla Firefox 1.0.1 [11]. In this version,
the warning was a modal dialog that allowed the user to
permanently accept, temporarily accept, or reject the cer-
tiﬁcate. When viewing the last test website, participants
encountered an SSL warning. The researchers reported
that 15 of their 22 subjects (68%) quickly clicked through
the warning without reading it. Only one user was later
able to tell the researchers what the warning had said.
The authors considered the clickthrough rate of 68% a
conservative lower bound because participants knew that
they should be looking for security indicators.
In 2007, Schechter et al. studied user reactions to Inter-
net Explorer 7’s SSL warning, which is the same one-click
interstitial that is present in all subsequent versions of In-
ternet Explorer [27]. Participants encountered the warning
while logging into a bank website to look up information.
The researchers were aware of ecological validity con-
cerns with laboratory studies and split their participants
into three groups: participants who entered their own cre-
dentials, a role-playing group that entered fake passwords,
and a security-primed role-playing group that entered
fake passwords. Overall, 53% of the total 57 participants
clicked through. However, only 36% of the non-role-
playing group clicked through. The difference between
the role-playing participants and non-role-playing partic-

certiﬁcates [24].

ipants was statistically signiﬁcant, illustrating one chal-
lenge of experiments in artiﬁcial environments.
Sunshine et al. performed multiple studies of SSL warn-
ings in 2009 [31]. First, they conducted an online survey.
They asked 409 people about Firefox 2, Firefox 3, and
Internet Explorer 7 warnings. Firefox 2 had a modal dia-
log like Firefox 1.0.1, and Firefox 3’s warning is similar
but not identical to the current Firefox warning. Less
than half of respondents said they would continue to the
website after seeing the warning. As a follow-up, Sun-
shine et al. also conducted a laboratory study that exposed
100 participants to SSL warnings while completing infor-
mation lookup tasks. The clickthrough rates were 90%,
55%, and 90% when participants tried to access their bank
websites in Firefox 2, Firefox 3, and Internet Explorer
7, respectively. The clickthrough rates increased to 95%,
60%, and 100% when participants saw an SSL warning
while trying to visit the university library website.
Sotirakopoulos et al. replicated Sunshine’s laboratory
SSL study with a more representative population sam-
ple [30]. In their study, 80% of participants using Firefox
3.5 and 72% of participants using Internet Explorer 7
clicked through an SSL warning on their bank website.
More than 40% of their participants said that the labora-
tory environment had inﬂuenced them to click through
the warnings, either because they felt safe in the study
environment or were trying to complete the experimental
task. Sotirakopoulos et al. concluded that the laboratory
environment biased their results, and they suspect that
these biases are also present in similar laboratory studies.
Bravo-Lillo et al. interviewed people about an SSL
warning from an unspeciﬁed browser [5]. They asked 20
participants about the purpose of the warning, what would
happen if a friend were to click through, and whether a
friend should click through the warning. Participants
were separated into “advanced” and “novice” browser
users. “Advanced” participants said they would not click
through an SSL warning on a bank website, but “novice”
participants said they would.
Passive Indicators. Some studies focused on passive
SSL indicators, which non-interruptively show the status
of the HTTP(S) connection in the browser UI. Although
browsers still have passive SSL indicators, interruptive
SSL and phishing warnings are now the primary tool for
communicating security information to users.
Friedman et al. asked participants whether screenshots
of websites depicted secure connections; many partici-
pants could not reliably determine whether a connection
was secure [15]. Whalen and Inkpen used eye-tracking
software to determine that none of their 16 participants
looked at the lock or key icon in the URL bar, HTTP(S)
status in the URL bar, or the SSL certiﬁcate when asked to
browse websites “normally” [34]. Some browsers modify
the lock icon or color of the URL bar to tell the user when
a website has an Extended Validation (EV) SSL certiﬁ-
cate. Jackson et al. asked 27 study subjects to classify
