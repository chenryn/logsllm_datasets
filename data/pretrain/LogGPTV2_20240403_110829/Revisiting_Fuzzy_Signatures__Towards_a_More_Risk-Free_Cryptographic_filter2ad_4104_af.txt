7.2 Efficiency Analysis of Our Fuzzy Signature
We finish with a concrete analysis of our fuzzy signature scheme.
We consider the 112 and 128-bit security levels (i.e., ConFMR ≤ 2−112)
and use the settings in Tab. 2 for n = 300 to define the fuzzy key
setting. Recall from Fig. 5 that the verification key consists of one
group element in G and a sketch, and the signature consists of two
elements in Zp and a sketch. The running time is the sum of the
individual runtime of the linear sketch and the Schnorr signature.
Specifically, the only difference from the Schnorr signature is the
linear sketch component. Tab. 3 gives the concrete parameters.

Finally, we provide graphical evidence on the validity of our
of the standard ways of assessing the quality of EVA [4, 30]. To
estimation of(cid:103)FMR andConFMRt for t ∈ [M]; such method is one
perform EVA to estimate(cid:103)FMR, we set k∗ = 0.1% × kmax, where
estimate eachConFMRt by setting k∗ = 0.5% × kmax. The following
Fig. 13 illustrates the validity of our estimation for(cid:103)FMR when the
dimension n = 300 andConFMRt for t = 50. It can be visibly checked
recall kmax is the number of total impostor pairs which is equal
to 3, 925, 584 for our dataset (see Rem. 1). We also set M = 100
to define the M-variant of { ConFMRt }t ∈[M] and perform EVA to
looking at the gray region that the estimation (in red line) aligns
with the values of w that we were able to measure with our database
(in blue line). Hence, EVA allows us to conclude that the extremely
small values that we were not able to measure with our dataset can
be approximated with our estimation. Additional experiments for
other parameters are provided in App. F.3.
In more detail, the sketch has size 4n bytes in general, where 4
bytes is used to represent each element by a 32-bit float. Plugging
in n = 300, it can be checked that the size of the sketch dominates
the signature and verification key size. The run time of Sketch
and DiffRec are 0.45ms and 1.3 ms for both security levels17, run
on a machine with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700K CPU at 3.70GHz.
Here, the universal hash UH used within our linear sketch scheme
(see Fig. 7) simply computes the inner-product with a random n-
dimensional vector over a prime field defined by the secret key space
Zp of the Schnorr signature scheme. We also implement the Schnorr
signature at the 112 and 128-bit security levels using elliptic curves
with 224 and 256-bit primes, respectively, run on a machine with
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1065G7 CPU at 1.30GHz. For both security
levels, the run times for signing and verification are at most several
tens of microseconds, thus at least an order of magnitude smaller
than the time taken by the linear sketch scheme.
We note that we can lower the sketch size by a factor of 2 by
representing the fuzzy biometrics by 16 bits rather than 32 bits. In
this case, the signature size will roughly be twice as small. Here,
treating less number of significant digits for the sketch value may
affect the correctness (i.e., FNMR) of the scheme, but not its security
as formally discussed in [33, Section 8].

A OMITTED PRELIMINARY
This section provides the omitted preliminaries.
A.1 Correctness and Security of Fuzzy
Signature
We define δ-correctness and EU-CMA security of a fuzzy signature.
δ-Correctness. We say a fuzzy signature scheme ΠFS for a fuzzy
key setting F is δ-correct if the following holds for all M ∈ M:
Pr[ppFS ← FS.Setup(1κ , F); x ← X ; vkFS ← FS.KeyGen(ppFS, x);
e ← Φ; σFS ← FS.Sign(ppFS, x + e , M) :
FS.Vrfy(ppFS, vkFS, M, σFS) = ⊤] ≥ 1 − δ .
EU-CMA Security. The security of a fuzzy signature scheme ΠFS
for a fuzzy key setting F is defined by the following game. The
model captures the scenario where the signatures are generated by
a slightly different fuzzy data each time.
Setup: The challenger runs ppFS ← FS.Setup(1κ , F), x ← X,
vkFS ← FS.KeyGen(ppFS, x), and provides the adversary A
with the public parameter ppFS and the verification key vkFS.
Finally, it prepares an empty set Q = ∅.
Signing Queries: The adversary A may adaptively submit mes-
sages. When A submits a message M ∈ M to the chal-
lenger, the challenger samples e ← Φ and runs σFS ←
FS.Sign(ppFS, x + e, M). It then provides ppFS to A and up-
dates the set as Q ← Q ∪ { M }.
Output: Finally, A outputs a pair (M∗, σ∗
FS). The adversary A wins
if M∗ (cid:60) Q ∧ FS.Vrfy(ppFS, vkFS, M∗, σ∗
The advantage of A is defined as its probability of winning the
above game. A fuzzy signature scheme ΠFS is called EU-CMA secure
if the advantage is negligible for all PPT adversaries.
FS) = ⊤.
A.2 Leftover Hash Lemma
We recall the leftover hash lemma of [7]. To see the connection with
the explanation in Sec. 5.4, we state it using conditional collision
probability.
Recall that for a joint distribution (X,Y), the (average) condi-
tional collision probability of X given Y is defined by COL(X|Y) =
Pr(x ,y),(x′,y′)←(X,Y)[x = x′|y = y′].
Session 6D: Authentication and Privacy CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea20592
Recall also that the statistical distance between two distributions
z |Pr[X = z] − Pr[Y = z]|.
X and Y is defined by SD(X,Y) := 1
It is known that SD(X,Y) upper-bounds the best (computationally
unbounded) adversary’s advantage in distinguishing the distribu-
tion using a single sample.
Lemma A.1 (Slightly adapted from [7]). Let UH = {UH :
D → R} be a family of universal hash functions. Let X and Y be
distributions such that (X,Y) forms a joint distribution, and the
support of X is contained in D. Then, the statistical distance of the
following two distributions is at most 1
2
(cid:112)|R| · COL(X|Y):
(cid:8)UH ← UH; (x, y) ← (X,Y) : (UH, UH(x), y)(cid:9),
(cid:8)UH ← UH; (x, y) ← (X,Y); r ← R : (UH, r, y)(cid:9).
In particular, if COL(X|Y) ≤ |R|−1 · 2−ω(log κ), then the statistical
distance is negl(κ).
Strictly speaking, [7] showed the above lemma using the (av-
erage) conditional min-entropy (rather than conditional collision
entropy/probabiltiy). However, the above lemma can be easily in-
ferred from the proof of [7, Lemma 2.4] and the fact that the most
basic form of the leftover hash lemma [14] (without taking into
account the existence of Y) works with collision entropy.
