There doesn't appear to be a way to configure `deno fmt`, and its `--help`
output mentions nothing about config files (apart from `tsconfig.json`).
I ran `deno fmt .` from a directory with a `.prettierrc.json` file containing:
    {
    	"tabWidth": 4,
    	"useTabs": true,
    	"semi": true,
    	"singleQuote": false,
    	"trailingComma": "es5",
    	"bracketSpacing": false,
    	"arrowParens": "avoid"
    }
Which `deno` completely ignored.
