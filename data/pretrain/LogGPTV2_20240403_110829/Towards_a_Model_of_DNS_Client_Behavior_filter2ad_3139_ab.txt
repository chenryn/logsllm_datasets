### Use of SafeBrowsing and the "Two Roots" Phenomenon

The use of SafeBrowsing is relatively common in our dataset. However, we have not identified any additional prevalent cases of the "two roots" phenomenon. From a modeling perspective, it remains undetermined whether clusters exhibiting this "two roots" characteristic would require special treatment.

### Distribution of Queries per Cluster

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of queries per cluster. The majority of clusters are small, with only a few large clusters. Specifically, 90% of the clusters contain at most 26 queries for up to 22 hostnames, and 90% of the clusters encompass at most 10 second-level domains (SLDs). The largest cluster spans 95 seconds and consists of 9,366 queries for names that match the third-level label. The second-largest cluster includes 6,211 queries for `myapps.developer.ubuntu.com`, which is likely due to a Ubuntu bug.

### Query Timing

Next, we examine when and how many queries clients issue. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the average number of queries issued by clients per day. For the Users dataset, the median number of daily lookups is 2,000, and 90% of clients issue fewer than 6,700 queries per day. In contrast, the Others dataset exhibits greater variability, with the top 5% of clients generating approximately as many total DNS queries per day as the bottom 95%.

A related metric is the inter-query time, or the time between subsequent queries from the same client. Figure 3 presents the distribution of inter-query times. The "Aggregate" line represents the distribution across all clients, while the "90%" area indicates the range within which 90% of individual client inter-query time distributions fall. Most inter-query times are short, with 50% of lookups occurring within 34 milliseconds of the previous query. However, there is a heavy tail, with 0.1% of inter-query times exceeding 25 minutes. Long inter-query times often correspond to periods when the client's user is away from the keyboard, such as during sleep or class. The Others datasets show a wide range of behavior, suggesting they are less amenable to a succinct aggregate model.

### Modeling Inter-Query Times

For the Users dataset, we can model the aggregate inter-query time distribution using the Weibull distribution for the body and the Pareto distribution for the heavy tail. Partitioning the data at an inter-query time of 22 seconds minimizes the mean squared error between the data and the two analytical distributions. Fitting these analytical distributions—split at 22 seconds—to each individual client's inter-query time distribution, we find that while the parameters vary per client, the empirical data is well-represented by the analytical models, with the mean squared error for 90% of clients being less than 0.0014. Therefore, the parameters for a model of query inter-arrivals will vary per client, but the distribution remains invariant.

### Timing Related to Clusters

We now shift focus from individual lookups to timing related to the 1 million lookup clusters, which encompass 12 million (80%) of the queries in our dataset (see Section 4). Figure 4 shows our results. The "Intra-cluster time" line represents the distribution of the time between successive queries within the same cluster, which is bounded to ε = 2.5 seconds by construction. Over 90% of the inter-arrivals are less than 1 second. The "Inter-cluster time" line shows the time between the last query of a cluster and the first query of the next cluster, with most clusters separated by much more than ε time. The "Cluster duration" line indicates the time between the first and last query in each cluster, with 99% of clusters lasting less than 18 seconds. Additionally, 50% of clustered queries belong to clusters with durations less than 4.6 seconds, and 90% are in clusters with durations less than 20 seconds. For the Others datasets, a smaller percentage of DNS queries occur in clusters, such as 60% in the Feb:Residential:Others dataset.

### Query Targets

Finally, we analyze the queries themselves, including relationships between queries.

### Popularity of Names

We analyze the popularity of hostnames using two methods: how often the name is queried across the dataset and how many clients query for it. Figure 5 shows the fraction of queries for each hostname (sorted by decreasing popularity) in the Feb:Residential:Users dataset. Of the 499,000 unique hostnames in our dataset, 256,000 (51%) are looked up only once. The top 100 hostnames account for 28% of DNS queries. Figure 6 shows the fraction of clients that query for each name. We find that 77% of hostnames are queried by only a single client, while over 90% of clients look up the 14 most popular hostnames. Thirteen of these hostnames are Google services, and the remaining one is `www.facebook.com`. The plot shows similar results for second-level domains (SLDs), where 66% of the SLDs are looked up by a single client.

The distributions of both queries per name and clients per name exhibit power-law behavior in the tail. Interestingly, the Pearson correlation between these two metrics—popularity by queries and popularity by clients—is only 0.54, indicating that a domain name with many queries is not necessarily queried by a large fraction of the client population, and vice versa. For example, `updatekeepalive.mcafee.com` is the 19th most queried hostname but is queried by a relatively small fraction of clients.
