To effectively implement CIS Control 15.6, "Monitor Service Providers," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Adhere to the Service Provider Management Policy**: Ensure that all monitoring activities align with the organization's established service provider management policy. This policy should outline the standards and expectations for service providers, including security requirements and performance metrics.

2. **Periodic Reassessment of Compliance**: Regularly evaluate the service provider's adherence to the agreed-upon security controls and compliance requirements. This may involve scheduled audits, reviews of security reports, and assessments of any changes in the service provider's operations or environment.

3. **Monitor Service Provider Release Notes**: Stay informed about updates, patches, and new features released by the service provider. Review release notes to understand potential impacts on the organizationâ€™s security posture and to ensure that any necessary updates are implemented promptly.

4. **Dark Web Monitoring**: Implement dark web monitoring to detect any compromised credentials or sensitive information related to the organization or its service providers. This can help in identifying and mitigating potential threats before they can be exploited.

CIS Control 15.6 is categorized under the asset type "Data" and falls within the security function "Detect." By following these procedures, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and respond to potential security issues associated with their service providers.
