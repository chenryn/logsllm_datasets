the asset is private information, what the adversary is doing
is stealing the information, and what the VPN is doing is
generically “protecting” against this threat. Examples of all
four sub-codes are given in Table II.
To capture additional context not represented by these
threat-model statements, such as whether the content is hu-
morous or claims about network performance, we use thematic
analysis with open coding [68].
Two researchers jointly developed the two codebooks by
independently coding ∼5 videos at a time, resolving differ-
ences, clarifying boundaries and adjusting the granularity of
the codes. We also reﬁned the structure for coding threat-
model statements as needed between batches. After coding
133 videos (∼37% of the dataset) and reaching sufﬁcient
conﬁdence in the codebooks, researchers attempted to establish
reliability on an additional 10% of the overall dataset (36
videos out of 359).6
We obtain an overall Krippendorff’s α of 0.757 with threat-
model statements and 0.941 with supplemental codes. For
threat-model statements, we count a unit of analysis to be
“agreed” if both coders identify the same four sub-codes.
Notably, this is a rather strict deﬁnition of agreement, since
there are four sub-agreements. Krippendorff’s α for the sub-
codes are .911 for VPN action, .839 for adversary action, .924
for asset, and .943 for adversary. All α values are consid-
ered reliable [61]. Having established reliability, researchers
divided and coded the remaining videos.
D. Limitations
We discuss three main potential limitations to our study.
Sampling
Although our initial large-scale scrape is likely
representative of YouTube (see § III-A and [58]), we narrow
down that dataset using a minimum view ﬁlter and an English
transcription ﬁlter. The minimum view limit excludes some
videos but does capture the vast majority of total views
(>99%), and therefore likely most of the total impact.
Though not without problems [69, 70],
the accuracy
of YouTube transcription has increased signiﬁcantly over
time [71–73]. Our manual labeling process (§ III-B) allowed
us to exclude false positives (words incorrectly transcribed as
“VPN”), but not to ﬁnd false negatives (“VPN” incorrectly
transcribed as something else). Our study was limited to a
keyword search for the term “VPN,” though there may be
other ways to determine if a video includes a VPN ad. 7
Finally, we limit our dataset to the English language, which
is native to the authors. U.S. customers are among the largest
VPN markets, with roughly a third of the global VPN mar-
ket [8]. We cannot generalize to VPN ads in other languages,
which may emphasize different content. We encountered sev-
eral non-English videos that YouTube phonetically transcribed
as English, which we discarded during coding.
Overall, our numbers represent a lower bound on the
prevalence of VPN ads on YouTube. Although not perfectly
generalizable, our dataset provides a meaningful view into the
English VPN ad space.
Accuracy in labeling We used open coding to determine
what to count as a VPN ad and then used content analysis
to classify ad contents. This process has well-known limita-
tions related to human judgement [74]. Further, our analysis
for threat-model statements are subject to granularity limita-
tions [75]. We use a strict standard for inter-rater reliability to
maximize validity and reliability.
Metrics
The deﬁnition of a view, as reported by YouTube,
is somewhat ambiguous [76]. Views are not necessarily unique
or singular, as one person may watch a video repeatedly or
multiple people may watch a video together on one device.
Further, ads may be skipped partially or entirely via fast-
forwarding, or devices may be unattended while a video plays.
While unlikely to be exact, we assume that views as reported
by YouTube strongly correlate with actual views in practice.
IV. RESULTS
We analyze in depth 243 videos with VPN ads. This sug-
gests there are ∼17,127 videos (Agresti-Coull CI95%=(15,136-
19,381)) containing VPN ads on YouTube. (The CI does not
account for labeling errors.) Further, it implies that numbers
reported in this study can be multiplied by ∼70.2 to roughly
estimate expected prevalence for all of YouTube, with varying
conﬁdence intervals. For example, VPN ads on all of YouTube
may have 4.4B views overall.
We analyze these videos in multiple ways: comparing
videos with and without VPN ads, in-depth analysis of ad
content, identifying problematic statements, comparison of ads
from different VPN companies, trends over time, common
advertising techniques, and a case study on the relationship
between companies (in this case, SurfShark) and YouTubers.
To better convey the impact of themes we identify, we report
total views alongside the number of videos.
A. Comparing videos with VPN ads to the rest of YouTube
When compared to the 10M subset, videos with VPN ads
(VPN ad sample) tend to have more views, a higher ratio of
likes and comments to views, and a similar ratio of dislikes
6In practice, the reliability set was coded in 10-video batches, calculating
reliabilities (without resolving differences) after each batch. Keeping track of
reliability numbers enabled us to, if need be, reset the reliability process by
resolving codes and starting a new set of 36 videos.
7After analysis, we revisited keyword search to ﬁnd any video that included
two of “virtual,” “private,” or “network” in a three-word sequence. This
method is more resilient to mistranscriptions and would have discovered two
additional videos while adding no new codes to our codebook.

and have a lower ratio of dislikes. Sampled to reduce crowding.

by YouTube. Gaming sub-genres are aggregated under “Gaming.”
(Figure 1). (Presumably creators with higher engagement are
more suitable for advertising; it’s unlikely that the VPN ad
sample received more attention because of the ads.)
Videos classiﬁed as gaming, technology, society, and pol-
itics are over-represented in the VPN ad sample relative to
a random sample (Figure 2);
in contrast, music, vehicle,
performing arts, and many other kinds of content are under-
represented. Although they show less topical diversity than a
random slice of YouTube, videos with VPN ads do belong
to a wide variety of categories, potentially reaching distinct
audiences. As an indicator of the heavy tail, 84% of the VPN
ad sample is distributed across the 27 least popular categories,
compared to 81% and 57 categories for the 10M subset.
A comparison between channels that produced videos with
VPN ads (n=161) and a random subset of channels (channels
that produced 10M subset, n=176.8K) shows similar trends.
B. What do VPN ads look like?
VPN ads were on average 63.5 seconds long (min=2.0,
max=210.9 σ=46.0)8. They were generally presented in either
one or two segments; videos that used two segments generally
introduced the sponsor at the start of the video and then
provided more ad content later.
In most cases, the product advertised was a VPN; how-
ever, sometimes YouTubers also mentioned add-ons the VPN
company bundles or sells separately. We took note of such
VPN ads (35 videos, 4,4M views); however, since it was often
unclear which advertised features belonged to the add-ons
vs. the VPNs, we could not reliably distinguish threat-model
statements between the products.
We assigned on average 7.6 unique threat-model statements
(min=0, max=43, σ=8.8) and 13.4 supplemental codes (min=1,
max=27, σ=3.9) per VPN ad.
While a majority of VPN ads (180 videos, 47.3M views)
consisted of the YouTubers simply talking about the prod-
8Sixty seconds seems to be an industry standard [27, 77].
uct (e.g., [78]), some produced extra content, such as skits
(e.g., [57]), or connected the advertisement to the rest of the
video (58 videos, 11.6M views). A minority of YouTubers
created heavily produced content just for the VPN ad (e.g., a
Ghostbusters parody for an ad [79]; 6 videos, 3.8M views). As
might be expected, videos with this kind of high production
value have more views on average.
A large minority of VPN ads include humor (66 videos,
32.1M views), typically in keeping with the tone of the channel
(e.g., [80]). As humor is subjective, we recorded which ads
might contain humor but do not elaborate; however, we note
that humor has been shown to be effective for education [81].
In a small number of cases, YouTubers did not directly
ﬁnancially beneﬁt from VPN ads appearing in their videos.
These so called “reaction videos” are re-uploaded content
where YouTubers embed other YouTubers’ content and “react”
to it, thus also reacting to the VPN ad (5 videos, 90.0K views).
In many cases, lesser known channels react to videos with
greater reach. For example, one video with 35K views, (adult
language) shows a reaction to a video with 3.6M views [82].
C. What do VPN ads talk about?
Next, we describe high-level themes we observed.
1) Broad security and privacy guarantees: As expected,
many VPN ads emphasize privacy and security beneﬁts. In
many cases, these beneﬁts are described using broad, abstract
guarantees. In these ads, the YouTuber typically describes the
VPN as “secure,” “safe,” or “hidden,” in relation to vague or
unspeciﬁed assets (171 videos, 45.6M views).
For many of these ads, the asset being protected is simply
the user themselves, rather than any more speciﬁc information
or asset they may possess. YouTubers say things like “I want
to be protected” [83] (76 videos, 19.2M views). Some mention
protecting their families instead of or in addition to themselves
(11 videos, 301.7K views).

Fig. 3: Relationships within threat-model statements: adversaries, what adversaries do, and assets under threat. Band colors show relations
to adversaries. Band widths are proportional to total views for videos including that pair. Pairs under 1.5M views are not plotted. Pairs with
gray bands have no stated adversary; statements without adversary actions are not included.
Other broad or abstract assets being protected include inter-
net activities as a whole; for example, “You can secure your
browsing in seconds” [84] (59 videos, 14.4M views). VPN
ads also claim to protect “data” (46 videos, 23.0M views)
and the “connection” (17 videos, 9.0M views). VPN ads in
this category also frequently invoke intangible assets such as
“security,” “safety,” and “rights” (58 videos, 14.5M views).
When describing these general protections, most YouTubers
use absolute terms that may overstate the power of VPNs,
such as “you are completely anonymous” [85] (154 videos,
43.5M views). Occasionally, the ads more realistically promise
improvement compared to not using a VPN, but without
absolute guarantees (26 videos, 2.2M views): for example,
“That NSA man has to work harder to ﬁnd you” [86].
2) Technical security features: The second content category
we identify also deals with privacy and security. In contrast
to the broad guarantees we discuss above, however, these ads
emphasize technical details when advertising security.
Changing or masking IP and location
Many of these
ads focus on speciﬁc assets, such as IP addresses (46 videos,
14.7M views), locations (63 videos, 34.0M views), or both (17
videos, 9.4M views). YouTubers most commonly referred to
directly altering the location or IP address (55 videos, 25.0M
views), using phrases like “change the country” and “switching
your IP address.” A smaller number are more precise, noting
that the VPN uses deception to make it appear as though the
location has changed (e.g., “pretend you are in another coun-
try” [87]; 25 videos, 19.6M views). Other ads emphasize that
the user’s location or IP address will stay private, using terms
such as “hiding,” “protecting,” “anonymizing,” or “preventing”
various threats (41 videos, 14.1M views).
Anecdotally, we note YouTubers seldom describe the rela-
tionship between IP addresses and location (that IP addresses
are one means of determining location) directly. We also
observe that changing or masking the apparent location is
frequently referenced in the context of consuming otherwise
unattainable content (§IV-C4); in many cases, the ad is unclear
about whether this will affect all visited sites or only the sought
content-provider site (e.g., [88]).
Use of encryption and routing
YouTubers also frequently
describe how VPNs use encryption (54 videos, 29.1M views).
VPNs are typically described as encrypting data, broadly
deﬁned: “your information,” “browsing data,” “internet data,”
etc. (41 videos, 20.3M views). This often gives the impression
that VPNs will encrypt all of a user’s data. In fact, in two
cases YouTubers did say VPNs would encrypt “everything”
(e.g., [89]; 2 videos, 87.6K views). A small minority of videos
more correctly note that what is encrypted is the connection
(e.g.,“encrypts your connection” [90]) or internet trafﬁc (13
videos, 8.9M views).
The type of encryption being used is described in various
ways (16 videos, 4.6M views). Some attempted to indicate
encryption strength using meaningless or even harmful terms
like “Military-grade” [91] (11 videos, 5.0M views), “double
encryption” (5 videos, 3.0M views), “powerful encryption”
(3 videos, 165.1K views), and superlatives such as “best-in-
class encryption” (4 videos, 450.8K views). Some YouTubers
list technical encryption speciﬁcations such as “AES-256” or
“512-bit encryption” (7 videos, 3.6M views).
A few videos emphasize (re)routing, using terms like “tun-
nel” and “route” (e.g., [92]). Assets routed include internet
trafﬁc (3 videos, 746.1K views), the “connection” (4 videos,
1.7M views), or even “data” broadly (3 videos, 1.3M views).

One channel combined many of these features together into
potentially misleading combinations, such as claiming that
a VPN add-on from VirtualShield can “clear your browsing
data” and “digitally shred ﬁles using military-grade encryp-
tion” [93] (6 videos from one channel, 112.2K views).
features
Other technical
Several VPN ads highlight
technical features related to privacy and security but do not
explicitly describe a threat model. These include no-data-
logging policies to ensure VPNs do not log user trafﬁc (19
videos, 6.8M views), a “kill switch” feature to ensure the
device does not switch to non-VPN routing if the VPN
service goes down (5 videos, 3.4M views), “split tunneling”
to allow selectively rerouting only speciﬁc trafﬁc (4 videos,
6.9K views), and being registered in countries not known for
their intelligence services (4 videos, 21.6K views).
3) Online threats: In addition to general security/privacy
guarantees and technical features, some YouTubers focus
primarily on threats that the VPN can (presumably) protect
against (151 videos, 50.2M views).
Who are the adversaries?
YouTubers in our dataset
describe many adversaries, generally together with the threats
they pose. Some of the most popular include (sometimes
vague) commercial entities like “the media” [56] (49 videos,
12.5M views) as well as various governments and intelligence
agencies, such as “government” or “Iranian Mullahs” [94]
(40 videos, 11.8M views). Other common adversaries include
“hackers” (47 videos, 11.9M views), Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) (37 videos, 9.2M views) and companies that monetize
user data (17 videos, 5.7M views). Others mention nebulous
bad actors such as “shady cyber sleuths” [95] (64 videos,
14.6M views). In a few cases, adversaries were deﬁned by
the attacks they commit: “thief,” “SWATter,” “DDOSer,” and
“scammer” (11 videos, 2.7M views).
As one example,
