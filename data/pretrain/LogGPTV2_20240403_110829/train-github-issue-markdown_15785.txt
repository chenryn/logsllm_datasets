Copied from microsoft/vscode#2000
When using Angular 2 and TypeScript I noticed that editing `template` strings
of components in TypeScript files are not working as one expect. There is not
autocomplete for tags and other usual HTML editing features.
For example
    import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
    @Component({
        selector: 'my-app',
        template: 'My First Angular 2 App'
    })
    export class AppComponent { }
Of course it's because the type definition has declared `template` as a String
and no part of VSCode knows that it's an HTML string.
My proposal is to define a `HTMLString` type where it's basically just string
but helps tooling in cases like this.
If it was possible to do this, then we can define `CSSString`,
`JavaScriptString`, `SCSSString` and so on...
