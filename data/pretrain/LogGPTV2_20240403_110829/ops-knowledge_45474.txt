User: How to execute a script regularly in Linux system?
Assistant: In the Linux system, you can use cron to execute a script regularly. Cron is a scheduled task service under the Unix/Linux system, which can execute specified commands and scripts within a specified time. 1. Write scripts First, you need to write scripts to be executed regularly. Scripts can be Bash, Perl, Python, or other executable scripting languages. For example, write a Bash script named myscript.sh that reads: ``` #!/bin/bash echo "Hello World" ``` This script will output "Hello World" when executed. 2. Create a scheduled task Next, you need to create a scheduled task to let the system automatically execute the script at the specified time. Open the cron configuration file and enter the following command: ``` crontab -e ``` This will open a text editor that will display the current user's cron table. One cron command per line. At the bottom of the text editor to add tasks. Grammar: `* * * * * command` - the first `*` means minutes (0~59), here it is set to execute every minute. - The second `*` indicates the hour (0~23), and here it is set to execute every hour. - The third `*` indicates the date (1~31), and it is set to be executed every day. - The fourth `*` indicates the month (1~12). - The fifth `*` indicates the week (0~6, where 0 indicates Sunday), which is set to be executed every week. - command is the command or script to execute. For example, to execute the myscript.sh script at 6:00 every morning, you can add the following configuration to the cron table: ``` 0 6 * * * /path/to/myscript.sh ``` This task will run at 6:00 every morning Execute the myscript.sh script. 3. Save the configuration After adding tasks, save the configuration and exit the text editor. Use the following commands to check and edit the cron tasks of the current user: ``` crontab -l #List the cron task list of the current user``` 4. Modify or delete a scheduled task To modify or delete an existing scheduled task, you can re- Use the crontab command to edit saved tasks. For example, to delete a created task, you can run the following command: ``` crontab -r # delete all cron tasks for the current user``` or edit a task: ``` crontab -e # edit the cron tasks for the current user`` ` Through cron, it is convenient to realize the function of regularly executing scripts in the Linux system.
