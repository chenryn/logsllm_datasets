The RoboKey System
John Laughlin with Barry Wels of TOOOL
“It's easy to love your own baby, 
but we wanted to get this out 
to the community. We 
figured they wouldn't 
be shy about telling us 
what was wrong with it.”
 –John Laughlin, 
Stanton Concepts

Background
John & Bob Laughlin
John was a communications engineer
Bob was a retired lock engineer
When telcom bust John started working with his father
Inspiration
Both have a healthy interest in security
World more interested in security than ever before
Opportunity to address a lot of areas that hadn't 
received the scrutiny they were due
How can we secure containers that have to change 
hands multiple times / survive tough environments
07/06/08

Basic Operation
Disc-Detainer type mechanism
Looks like an Abloy style cylinder
Has flies like a combo lock
Extremely rugged for environmental conditions
Automatic dialer
Operator does not need to know combo, just has to be 
a valid user
Various potential forms of authentication – password, 
RFID, embedded dialer in cell phone, matched pair, etc.
Manual dialer
Physical lock can still be operated manually

Community Scrutiny
First Introductions
Bob Laughlin met Han Fey via eBay/both avid collectors
Met in Holland in early 2006 to see RKS
Han invited John to the Dutch Open
Dutch Open
“The people were very generous with their knowledge”
Panel on viable attacks & applications
ALOA
Attended ALOA with Han & Barry
Showcased RKS & other products
Article in Locksmith Ledger as a result

Open Source Future
Open source developer kits
Looking to license their product
Wanted to get the ball rolling while seeking a deal
Open source software and microcontroller
Add whatever functionality you want
Aiming to get total package, lock & dialer kit for ~$300
Would love to hear from you
John has always kept in touch with folks in the locksport 
community
Answering questions and fielding commentary about the

Bump In The Night
How blind were we?
Walt Strader told the WSJ he heard of bumping via 
locksport groups
Told them this in 2006
Smartkey is launched
Lock is 100% bump proof
Rekeyable (NOT U-Change)
Subdued marketing campaign – no initial mention of 
bumping
Rigorous testing process

How Does It Work?

Testing
2006 Dutch Open
Prototype from an unnamed company
Arthurmeister!
Definite challenge
Japan
Different culture of entry
Interesting methods of testing
Passed the 15 minute attacks with flying colors

Smartkey 2
The new generation
Updated materials for destructive entry (DE) concerns
Similarly subdued roll-out to first generation
Out now!
What does the future hold?
Black and Decker employees now keep an active eye 
on the locksport community
Led to current advances & additional free feedback
Excited for future collaboration

Zeke's Contest
Everyone missed the flaw – forest for the trees
Created proof of concept

Simplification
The goal
Build the simplest version of Jaakko's tool possible
Build the least expensive version possible
The tool
At the advice of a fellow lockpicker we used the filed 
down head of a nail
Many impressioning mediums were tried before we 
settled on white glue

Alerting ABUS
First Contact
Arranged by an LP101 member “mh”
Initial response was polite, but non-commital
Proof is in the pudding - Jaakko's PDF got attention
The Response
A brief silence
Updated all current production
Challenged Jaakko to defeat the new mixed cylinder
Jaakko could only get the keys to the lock if he 
uncovered the bitting

Current Events
Jaakko's ABUS Plus Pick

Successfully picked the challenge lock!

My Obsession
Why Medeco?
Holy Grail of pin tumblers
Pins must lift and rotate
Lots of attempts by the community
OK – Show me...in one picture

The Problems
Open Grooves
OMG Wire!
Even Spacing

Humble Beginnings
Early tool designs aimed at rotating all of the pins at once

 actually "look" behind the discs...”

Let's Simplify
Maybe I'll try hooking into one pin first

Public release & NDE
Wanted to publicly release via NDE Magazine
“Let's get a manufacturer reaction”

Quite A Reaction
Peter Field
Head of R&D at Medeco 
drove to my house
Lock talk, history, other 
exploits, etc.
Closed Grooves

Keep going! Nothing is impossible!
Think before disclosure!
Don't get wrapped up, have fun!

Final Thoughts
Please help
We're getting our feet in the door
Our communities are merging
Physical security disclosure is DIFFERENT than digital 
security disclosure
Want to help?

And finally, that super-secret announcement...

The NDE Grant
Misson
   Our goal is to help get tools and supplies into the hands 
of hobbyists who are doing legitimate lock research.
   Once an exploit is discovered and verified we work with 
the researcher(s) to communicate with the manufacturer.
   I have privately funded a few research projects, but this 
is not sustainable for me financially, so I'm opening the 
funding up to public donations.
