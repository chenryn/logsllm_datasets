**Title: BlackHat Asia 2023 - New Wine in an Old Bottle: Attacking Chrome WebSQL**

In recent years, Google Chrome has implemented multiple mitigation mechanisms to reduce the attack surface for traditional Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, such as those found in V8 and Blink. These enhancements have significantly increased the difficulty of exploiting these well-known attack vectors. However, we have identified that SQLite, which can be accessed by remote attackers via the Chrome WebSQL API, remains a potential vulnerability.

In this presentation, we will introduce a mutation-based fuzzer specifically designed for WebSQL. This fuzzer leverages advanced syntax tree and context analysis to generate SQL samples with high syntactic and semantic correctness. As a result, it has uncovered several new vulnerabilities in WebSQL.

Since the enhancement of the SQL statement whitelist restriction in Chrome WebSQL in 2020, most of the acknowledged CVEs related to WebSQL have been discovered using our fuzzer. All of the identified vulnerabilities have been rated as high severity. We will also share the details and exploits of these vulnerabilities during our talk.
