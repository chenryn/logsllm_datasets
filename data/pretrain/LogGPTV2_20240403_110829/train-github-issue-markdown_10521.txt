Hello,
I spent a few hours debugging my system the other day because my disk was full
- not because of space but because of inodes. In fact, it was the cache
sessions directory that was full of sess_* files.
As it was already stated in pr #1097, on systems like Debian, the default
session.gc_probability is defined to 0, and a cron task takes care of the
/var/lib/php5 directory, which is the default session.save_path.
But by default, Symfony changes that behavior and puts the sessions in the
cache directory of the environment, which is then never garbage collected. If
you don't "cache:clear" your environment periodically, you'll be running out
of inodes sooner or later (I had some scripts using my webservices, which
created sessions over and over again).
I think this issue should be at least documented in session management of the
HttpFoundation. But maybe I could also modify the cache:clear task or create a
new one, that would only run the garbage collection of sessions. Or do you
think it is enough to document that you need to modify the /etc/cron.d/php5
file to change the directory and add more lines for the different environments
?
Regards.
