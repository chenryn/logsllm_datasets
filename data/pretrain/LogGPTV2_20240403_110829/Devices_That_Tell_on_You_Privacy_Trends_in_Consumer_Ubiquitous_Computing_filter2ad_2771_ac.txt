### Table 3: True and False Positive Rates for 10 and 40-Minute Probes of Both Wired and Wireless Traces

- **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: The rate at which an n-minute query of a specific movie is correctly identified as that movie.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: The rate at which an n-minute query of some other movie is incorrectly identified as the specific movie.

### 2.4 Limitations, Implications, and Challenges

Our experiments, conducted in a laboratory setting, reflect potential configurations in a future home equipped with multiple wireless multimedia devices. The results suggest that an adversary in close proximity to a user's home could infer information about the videos being watched. This adversary could be a nosy neighbor or someone collecting forensic evidence on "illegal" content. Content producers might intentionally create more distinctive fingerprints, violating users' privacy expectations, even with encryption.

More broadly, our Slingbox results demonstrate that encryption alone cannot fully conceal data. Other studies show that one can infer the origins of encrypted web traffic or application protocol behaviors [30, 45]. Concurrently, Wright et al. have shown how variable bitrate encodings can reveal the language spoken through an encrypted VoIP connection [46]. Protecting against such information leakage vectors for all applications is a fundamental challenge. It may be difficult to preserve desirable properties like low latency and low bandwidth consumption while also mitigating data-dependent communication properties. For example, pushing data at a constant rate from a Slingbox could reduce information leakage but still allow an eavesdropper to determine when and for how long a user watches movies.

### 3 The Nike+iPod Sport Kit: Devices that Reveal Your Presence

The Nike+iPod Sport Kit foreshadows the types of application-specific UbiComp devices we might soon wear daily. Based on publicly available information and personal observations, many Nike+iPod users will likely leave their sensors turned on and in their shoes.

#### 3.1 Nike+iPod Description

The Nike+iPod Sport Kit allows runners and walkers to hear real-time workout progress reports on their iPod Nanos. Users purchase an iPod Nano, a Nike+iPod Sport Kit, and either Nike+ shoes or a special pouch for non-Nike+ shoes. The kit includes a receiver and a sensor. The sensor is placed in the left Nike+ shoe, and the receiver is attached to the iPod Nano. When a person runs or walks, the sensor broadcasts data via a radio transmitter, whether or not an iPod Nano is present. If the person stops for ten seconds, the sensor goes to sleep. When the iPod Nano is in workout mode and the receiver receives sensor data, it relays that data to the iPod, which provides audio feedback. As of September 2006, Apple has sold over 450,000 $29 (USD) Nike+iPod Sport Kits [1].

#### 3.2 Discovering the Nike+iPod Protocol

**Initial Analysis**: The first step was to learn how the Nike+iPod sensor communicates with the receiver. According to documentation, a sensor and receiver must be linked before use, involving user participation. Once linked, the receiver only reports data from that specific sensor, eliminating readings from nearby sensors. The receiver remembers the last sensor it was linked to, so users do not need to repeat the linking process each time they turn on their iPods. However, we observed that a single sensor could be linked to two receivers simultaneously, meaning two people could read data from a single sensor at the same time. Further investigation revealed that the sensor is a transmitter only, unable to know which iPod or receiver it is associated with. This observation shows that the Nike+iPod Sport Kit does not enforce a strong, exclusive, one-to-one binding between a sensor and a receiver.

**Hardware, Serial Communications, and Unique Identifiers**: The Nike+iPod Sport Kit receiver communicates with the iPod Nano through the standard iPod connector. We determined that communication was likely done over a serial connection by examining the pins on the receiver's connector and comparing them with third-party pin documentation [24]. Opening the receiver's white plastic case revealed a component board and pin connections. Using an oscilloscope and soldered wires, we verified digital data was sent over the serial connection.

**Linking Process**: Before using a new sensor, it must be linked to the receiver. This is initiated through the iPod interface, where the user walks around so the sensor can be detected. The iPod sends data to the receiver, which then sends data back until the sensor is discovered and linked. Finally, the iPod sends more data to the receiver. After analyzing several traces, we noticed that linking completed when the third occurrence of a certain packet came from the receiver. These packets started with the same four bytes, followed by four unique bytes for each sensor. We refer to these four bytes as the sensor's unique identifier (UID). We used the iPod Nano as an oracle to translate between UIDs and the sensor's serial number.

**Automatically Discovering UIDs**: To listen for sensor UIDs without the iPod Nano, we modified an iPod female connector by soldering wires from the serial pins to our adapter, adjusted the voltage, and attached 3.3V power. Plugging an unmodified receiver into our connector and replaying the data seen during the link process caused the receiver to send packets with the identifiers of broadcasting sensors. Since our computer never responds, the link process continues, and the receiver keeps sending sensor identifiers until power is removed.

**Implications**: Our observations imply that the Nike+iPod Sport Kit may leak private information about a user's location. If a wireless device broadcasts a persistent globally unique identifier, an attacker with multiple wireless sniffers can correlate the signals to track the user's location.
