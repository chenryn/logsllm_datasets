Introduction
● Why this talk?
● Building a lab
● Tools
● Forward Engineering
● Reverse Engineering
Building a Lab
● Space
● Ventilation
● Lighting
● Work surfaces
● Grounding
Soldering
● Iron selection
● Solder selection
● Practicing
● Limits of human ability
Advanced Soldering Tricks
● Toaster oven reflow soldering
● Skillet reflow soldering
● Hot air tools
Toaster Oven Refow
● Toaster oven as heat source
● Temperature controlled by computer
Skillet Reflow
● Electric skillet as heat source 
● Easier to watch progress
Hot Air Tools
● Heat gun
● Hot air pencil
Tools
● Volt/Ohm meter (VOM)
● Oscilloscope
● Logic probe
● Logic analyzer
Volt/Ohm Meter
● Analog vs. digital
● Bells and whistles
Oscilloscopes
● Analog vs. digital
● DIY or buy?
● Secondhand or new?
Logic Probes
● Display the state of a single logic signal
● DIY or buy?
Logic Analyzers
● Display the state of multiple logic signals
● Usually can record signals
● DIY versions
USB tools
● Portable, can be cheaper
● May be OS constrained
DIY tools
● XOScope
● Parallel port logic analyzers
● JTAG wigglers
● Flash Dumpers

● Application Notes
Forward Engineering
As opposed to...the other kind.
Process
● Gather requirements
● Research resources
● Assemble solution
● Test and refine
Chip Selection
● Architecture
● Speed
● Storage space
● I/O
● Embedded peripherals
Embedded Architectures
● PowerPC
● ARM
● MIPS
● X86
● HC91S12
● ARM
● PIC
Evaluation Boards
● Purpose
● Sources
GNU Toolchains
● Allows cross­compilation
● Availability highly variable
Embedded OSs
● OS or not?
● Embedded Linux
● FreeRTOS
● DOS (No, really)
No OS
● Task loop
● Data storage
● Interrupts
● I/O
● Timers
Building Blocks
● Pluggable functionality
● Object Oriented hardware!
Communication
● CAN bus
● SPI / 2­Wire / I2C
● RS232's not dead
Reverse Engineering
Live by the soldering iron, die by the DMCA
Process
● Start with a product
● Figure out the subsystems
● Determine the parts of interest
● Figure out what each part does
Reading PCBs
● Parts
● Traces
● Silkscreen
Filling in the Blanks
● Datasheet searches
● Recognizing common subsystems
Protocol Reversing
● Snooping
● Fuzzing
Dumping Code
● BDM
● JTAG
● Flash Dumpers
● EPROMS
Decompiling
● IDA Pro
● Learn assembly, microcontroller organization
The End
● Thanks to the Hacker Foundation, etc...
