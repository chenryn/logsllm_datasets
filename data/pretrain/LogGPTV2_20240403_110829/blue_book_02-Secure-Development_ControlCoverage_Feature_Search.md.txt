### Search Description and Rationale

| Control | Severity | Automated Fix Script | Description |
|---------|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Medium | Yes | Granting minimum access through RBAC ensures that users have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, minimizing the risk of resource exposure in case of a user or service account compromise. |
| **Users monitoring/supporting the Search service should be provided with minimum required permissions** | Medium | No | Providing minimum access to the monitoring and support team ensures they have just enough permissions to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of data exposure in case of a compromise. |
| **Sensitive data at the data source must be encrypted at rest** | High | No | Encrypting sensitive data at rest minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and helps meet regulatory compliance requirements. |
| **Sensitive data must be encrypted in transit** | High | No | Using HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking attacks. |
| **Admin keys must be furnished only for clients who need to manage the search catalog of the Search service** | High | No | Admin keys provide full access to all operations, including managing the service, creating, and deleting indexes, indexers, and data sources. These keys should be strictly controlled and owned by the administrators. |
| **Consumers who require read access on the Search service must only be granted 'query' keys** | High | No | Query keys grant read-only access to indexes and documents, preventing excessive permissions such as creating and deleting indexes. Only query key access should be given to readers. |
| **Search service must have at least three replicas for high availability** | Medium | Yes | Adding replicas enhances high availability. Each replica has one copy of an index, and a minimum of three replicas is recommended by Azure to ensure optimal performance and reliability. |
| **Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days** | Medium | Yes | Retaining logs for at least 365 days allows for activity trail reconstruction during investigations in the event of an incident or compromise. This period also aligns with typical compliance requirements. |

This table provides a clear and concise overview of the controls, their severity, whether an automated fix script is available, and a detailed rationale for each control.
