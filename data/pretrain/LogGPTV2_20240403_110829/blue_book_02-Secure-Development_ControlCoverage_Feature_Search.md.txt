SearchDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptAll users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.MediumYesNoUsers monitoring/supporting the Search service should be provided with minimum required permissionsGranting minimum access to monitoring and support team ensures that they are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of data compromise.MediumNoNoSensitive data at data source must be encrypted at restUsing this feature ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest. This minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and also helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.HighNoNoSensitive data must be encrypted in transitUse of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.HighNoNoAdmin keys must be furnished only for clients who need to manage the search catalog of Search serviceGranting Admin keys to clients means giving access to all operations, including the ability to manage the service, create and delete indexes, indexers, and data sources. So they should be maintained and owned only by the users administering the service.HighNoNoConsumers who require read access on Search service must only be granted 'query' keysQuery keys grant read-only access to indexes and documents. So to avoid giving excessive permissions like creating and deleting indexes, only QueryKey access should be given to readersHighNoNoSearch service must have at least three replicas for high availabilityHigh availability can be achieved by adding replicas. Each replica has one copy of an index, so adding one more replica translates to one more index that can be used to service query requests. Minimum of three replicas are required since the azure team has specified three to be the borderline value for the sameMediumYesNoDiagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 daysLogs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.MediumYesNo
