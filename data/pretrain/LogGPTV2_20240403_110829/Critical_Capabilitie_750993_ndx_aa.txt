Initiatives:
APM and observability tools provide visibility into the digital experience that optimizes user engagement. Use cases now include security, and OpenTelemetry portends a new type of standardization. With many tools available, I&O leaders must identify their critical capabilities.This Critical Capabilities is related to other research:
Overview
Key Findings
■	A surge in online channel demand and delivery continues unabated, even as the 	pandemic appears to slow. Interest in application performance monitoring and 	observability tools remains high, as does innovation in the market.■	An increase in well-publicized and damaging security breaches has led some APM 	and observability vendors to add security capabilities, most often a type of runtime 	application self-protection.
■	The CNCF-curated OpenTelemetry distributed tracing standard is nearing completion 	and is becoming widely supported. The third element of the standard, logs, is due by 	the end of 2022, at which time the first version will be complete. Many vendors 	represented in this research are already shipping implementations of OpenTelemetry.Recommendations

■	Choose an application performance monitoring and observability solution by 	including use cases and personas outside IT operations, such as DevOps, site 	reliability engineering and security operations. This encourages collaboration, 	maximizes the value of the tool and broadens the target audience.■	Maximize future flexibility by requiring support for OpenTelemetry and other 	standards in your APM and observability product selection process. Even if you are 	not adopting OpenTelemetry today, it is becoming an increasingly common way to 	collect performance data from external services.■	Align your requirements, use cases and relevance to appropriate personas and the 	best-fit tool options by using this research, combined with Gartner’s Cool Vendors 	research, to examine the rapidly shifting APM market.
What You Need to KnowWhat You Need to Know
Application performance monitoring (APM) and observability software enables the observation and analysis of application health, performance and user experience (UX). It is used widely in enterprises by IT operations, site reliability engineers (SRE), cloud and platform operations, application developers, and product owners.
The key functional requirements of APM and observability tools include:■	Observation of an application’s complete transactional behavior
■	Automated discovery and mapping of application and infrastructure dependencies 	(including cloud services)
■	Monitoring of applications running on mobile devices and desktop browsers
■	Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on 	business outcomes■	Native integration capabilities with automation and service management tools, as 	well as native integration with public cloud providers — for example, Amazon Web 	Services (AWS) CloudWatch, Azure Monitor and Google Cloud Operations
■	Analysis of business key performance indicators (KPIs) and user journeys■	The ability to perform interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (such as 	traces, metrics and logs) to detect “unknown unknowns” — that is, to identify 	underlying causes of unexpected events

■	Application security functionality, often delivered via a common agent or frameworkGartner has established six critical capabilities in the context of six use cases that
differentiate the most-popular tools in this market:
■	Application debugging and distributed profiling (ADDP)
■	Behavior analysis
■	Business analysis
■	IT service and infrastructure monitoring
■	Root cause analysis
■	Runtime application self-protection (RASP)
The six use cases are:
■	Application owner/line of business (LOB)■	DevOps/AppDev
■	Digital experience monitoring (DEM)
■	IT operations
■	Security operations
■	Site reliability engineering (SRE)/platform operations
This research focuses on the competitiveness of APM software products with respect to
key functional dimensions, rather than the overall strengths and weaknesses of the
ors,
including corporate viability, vision, marketing and the geographic focus of the vendorsthat offer these APM software products. We recommend that organizations use this
research in conjunction with the Magic Quadrant, inquiries with Gartner analysts and other
Gartner research to define their requirements and select the solutions that best match their
needs.
