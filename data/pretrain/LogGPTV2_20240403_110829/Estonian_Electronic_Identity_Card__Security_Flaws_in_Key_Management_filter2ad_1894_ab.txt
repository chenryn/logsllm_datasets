### Dataset Containing the Same RSA Public Key

In most cases, the public keys were shared between the authentication and digital signature certificates of the same ID card. However, in two instances, the same public key was shared between two different cardholders. Such a fault could only have occurred due to a severe violation of the production processes, as each key pair is required to be unique, even for the keys on the same ID card.

All certificates were issued for jTOP SLE66-powered ID cards. The certificate issuance times for each pair differ by only a few seconds, indicating that the certificates were issued in parallel or very close to each other. In most cases, the duplicate public keys resulted from the ID card renewal process performed at PPA customer service points to replace the vulnerable applet for ID cards issued in 2011 (see Section 3).

### 4.1 Possible Cause and Impact

One possible explanation for these duplicate keys is a poor source of randomness used in the on-card key generation process. However, since the ID card chip has no built-in time source, this hypothesis can be safely rejected. The close timing of the certificate issuance suggests that a software bug, such as a race condition, caused the same public key to be included in multiple certificates. This would result in at least one of the certificates from the pair being unusable electronically, as the actual private key on the ID card would not correspond to the public key in the certificate.

When the same public key is shared between the digital signature and authentication certificates of the same ID card, the risk is that knowing only one PIN (PIN1 or PIN2, depending on which slot contains the corresponding private key) allows the card to be used for both purposes. A more serious risk occurs when the same public key is shared between different cardholders. For example, in pair 1, either Toivo can sign on behalf of Ülle, or Ülle can use her digital signature key to authenticate as Toivo and decrypt files encrypted for Toivo. These use cases would require modifying the software.

It is possible that the ID cards contain duplicate private keys. If this is the case, the only credible explanation is that the manufacturer generated the keys outside the card and, due to a flaw in the personalization process, the same key was imported into two different ID cards or key slots.

### 4.2 Proof that ID Cards Share the Same Keys

To investigate the shared public keys of the digital signature certificate of Ülle and the authentication certificate of Toivo (pair 1), we contacted Toivo, who informed us that his ID card was renewed at a PPA customer service point in Viljandi. He provided cryptographic proof that both private keys in his ID card correspond to the public keys specified in the certificates. We created a proof-of-concept digital signature container in the name of Ülle to demonstrate that Toivo’s authentication private key can be used to forge a digital signature of Ülle.

We did not manage to contact Ülle to obtain similar cryptographic proof. In October 2014, we learned that the manufacturer had discovered the incident, as Toivo was invited to replace his ID card under warranty. Ülle’s ID card remained valid. In spring 2015, we obtained confirmation from an Estonian service provider that Ülle had used the ID card for both authentication and signing in the e-service of the provider. In summer 2016, we managed to contact Ülle’s daughter, who informed us that her mother used the card daily for online banking transactions. Later, we learned that her ID card was renewed at a PPA customer service point in Tallinn.

### 4.3 Incident Response

In October 2014, the manufacturer learned of the anomaly of duplicate keys. On 2014-10-09, a new ID card was produced for Toivo, and on 2014-10-10, Toivo received an invitation from PPA to replace his ID card under warranty. The email stated that the ID card renewal on 2012-11-06 was unsuccessful, but this was not true. Replacement cards were issued for other cardholders on 2014-10-09, 2014-12-22, and 2015-01-06. For unknown reasons, the duplicate keys on Sandra's ID card (pair 3) were missed, and she did not receive a replacement card. As a result, a similar fault occurred later with the ID card of Siim (pair 10).

The incident was not handled as a security issue. The affected certificates were not revoked until the cardholders visited a PPA customer service point to receive the replacement card. Ülle was able to use her ID card until shortly before its expiration. Liis informed us that the invitation from PPA did not reach her.

### 5. Private Keys Generated Outside the ID Card

At the end of 2013, concerns were raised in Estonia about authorities having copies of ID card private keys. The authorities rebutted these concerns, claiming that the keys are generated inside the chip and never leave the card. The security requirement for key generation inside the chip has been documented in various specifications and contracts.

### 5.1 Finding the Evidence

In 2016, Svenda et al. described a method to infer details about the algorithm used to generate RSA public keys from the most significant byte (MSB) of the modulus N. We used this and other techniques to verify whether the properties of the RSA keys in the ID card certificates match those of the key generation algorithm implemented by the ID card platform. We generated and exported thousands of keys from each ID card platform to obtain reference keys, simultaneously measuring the time taken by the on-card key generation process.

#### 5.1.1 MICARDO

We found a configuration flaw in all MICARDO-powered ID cards that allowed us to perform card management operations with PIN2 without knowing the manufacturer’s symmetric card management keys. We used this to generate and export over a million 1024-bit RSA key pairs generated by the platform.
