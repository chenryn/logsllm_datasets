User: Please explain what are Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)? What is the difference between them?
Assistant: Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of integrating code into a common code base and automatically running builds and tests. Whenever there is a code change, the CI system automatically runs a series of build and test scripts to ensure that the new code is properly integrated with the existing code. This helps teams find and fix issues faster, reducing the chance of code integration conflicts. Continuous Deployment (CD) is an automated process that pushes new code into production. During this process, new releases can be automatically released through automated testing and deployment, which helps reduce manual errors and reduce delivery times. The difference between them is that continuous integration is just the process of continuous integration and testing of code, while continuous deployment is the process of automatically deploying code in a production environment based on continuous integration. In other words, Continuous Deployment is an automated code delivery solution that helps teams deliver great software faster.
