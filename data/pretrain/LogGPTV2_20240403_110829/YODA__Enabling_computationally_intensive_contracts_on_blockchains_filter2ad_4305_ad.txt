B. RICE Analysis
In this section we prove that RICE adds low overhead and
is secure.
Lemma VII.1. Given RICE terminates in an subarray of size
2k, let φ be the number of times Ψ(σ, τ ) is interrupted to
update the seed in RICE, then
(k − 1)k

lower bound 1 − (i − 1)/2b2 and if m ≤ b2 the mean is
lower bounded by 0. Hence Xk which is the sum of all trials
has tail distribution strictly higher than the tail of the sum
of (b2 − 1)b2/2 i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with mean
1−(i−1)/2b2. There are (k−1)k

with m > b2. The result follows.

Remark 1: Recall that MIRACLE allows the system designer
to choose an appropriate |ES| size to achieve an expected
number of rounds. In this way, the number of rounds can be
limited to less than a constant i w.h.p.
