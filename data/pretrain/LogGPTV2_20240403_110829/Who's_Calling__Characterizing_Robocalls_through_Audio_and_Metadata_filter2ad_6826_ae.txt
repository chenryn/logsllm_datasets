times. SSA Campaigns are known to target speciﬁc segments
of population who are more vulnerable than the rest [29].
Finding 24: We uncovered two large scale robocalling cam-
paigns that selectively target the Mandarin speaking Chinese
population in North America. Our campaign identiﬁcation
mechanism uncovered two unique robocalling campaigns that
operated in Mandarin and in turn was targeted towards Chi-
nese population in the United States. Each campaign had a
campaign size of 62 and 51. Both the campaigns imperson-
ated the Chinese Consulate. The ﬁrst campaign threatened
the callers that there was an important document which had
expired, and it needed immediate attention of the caller to
press a speciﬁc digit. The second campaign mentioned that
the caller had an urgent message which was time sensitive.
6 Discussion
The future of robocall mitigation: Current robocall mitiga-
tion techniques use caller ID and other heuristics to identify
suspected robocalls. Using call traceback [30, 31] to investi-
gate even a fraction of such suspicious calls is time consuming
and does not scale well for the provider. Instead, providers
can operate their own honeypots and use the campaign identi-
ﬁcation technique demonstrated in our paper. Providers can
systematically identify fraudulent and abusive robocalling
campaigns and surgically target the source of such operations.
By prioritizing the takedown of speciﬁc campaigns, providers
can better protect their subscribers.
Will new initiatives and regulations reduce unsolicited
calls?: To improve enforcement against unsolicited calls, the
United Stated passed the TRACED Act [32] into law on De-
cember 31st, 2019. Among other things, this act mandates the
deployment of STIR/SHAKEN within a certain period and
increases penalties for illegal calls. Unfortunately, by the time
the regulatory agencies impose penalties on robocalling oper-
ations [33], the perpetrators have already generated billions
of robocalls. We do not yet know if STIR/SHAKEN will be
effective in addressing the problem of unsolicited phone calls,
especially because calls that transit any TDM network will be
unauthenticated. During our study, no providers were passing
STIR/SHAKEN authentications to our provider. Therefore,
Figure 6: Many of our case study scam campaigns operate
over long periods
based on their line rotation habits.
Finding 21: We ﬁnd that 2.86% (77) campaigns used neigh-
bor spooﬁng by matching the NPA-NXX of the calling number
to the called number. Of all the campaigns that did employ
NPA-NXX based neighbor spooﬁng, we found that on an av-
erage 48.5 % of calls made by these campaigns used neighbor
spooﬁng. There were 14 (0.52%) campaigns with 100% neigh-
bor spooﬁng rate, indicating that they matched the NPA-NXX
for every call. These results indicate that operators regularly
evolve spooﬁng strategies within a single campaign. This ﬁnd-
ing describes the neighbor spooﬁng behavior observed among
recorded phone calls which belong to a speciﬁc campaign,
whereas Finding 10 describes an aggregate view of neighbor
spooﬁng among all calls made to our honeypot.
5.5 Case Studies
To get an overview about the contents of a cluster, we ran-
domly selected 3 calls from the top 40 clusters and listened to
them. This allowed us to label the top clusters as seen in Fig-
ure 5 and also helped us to selectively delve into campaigns
with unique characteristics. We discovered that of the differ-
ent telemarketing campaigns, many of them use potentially
misleading tactics to encourage victims to engage.
Finding 22: We uncovered two fraudulent robocalling cam-
paigns which impersonated the Social Security Administration
(SSA) ofﬁce, a United States agency. Our honeypot discov-
ered two separate large scale fraudulent campaigns which
clearly violates multiple federal and state laws. Both these
campaigns used different audio recordings. The ﬁrst SSA
Campaign (SSA Campaign #1) was the 10th largest campaign
in our honeypot with a campaign size of 396. This campaign
extensively used 224 unique toll-free numbers as the caller
ID to generate unsolicited calls. We observed that this ﬁrst
SSA Campaign operated throughout the duration of our study
– April 2019 to February 2020. The second SSA Campaign
(SSA Campaign #2) had a campaign size of 75 and operated
from August 2019 to November 2019.
We observe that, IRS impersonation (anecdotally one of
the most common scams) has given way to different tactics
focused on immigration and social security. We suspect that

our data does not yet indicate if this mechanism will be effec-
tive or not.
Recommendation to the public: As explained in Section 4.3,
we found no statistically signiﬁcant effect of answering phone
calls on the average number of unsolicited phone calls re-
ceived. Despite this ﬁnding, we suggest the general public
should still use caution in answering unsolicited calls.
Limitations: Like all measurement studies, our work does
have some limitations. First, because we do not do any seeding
of our numbers, our results may be biased towards campaigns
that dial at random. However, the low spread values of our top
campaigns indicate that some of our campaigns indeed specif-
ically targeted our lines. Second, our estimates of voicemail
spam, wangiri, and neighbor spooﬁng are based on heuristics,
and may be subject to false positives. In particular, our neigh-
bor spooﬁng estimates assume that callers are not purchasing
lines to match the caller, and, given the difﬁculty of such an
operation, we believe this is unlikely. Moreover, in general
our methods cannot distinguish between “legitimate” line ro-
tation and spooﬁng. Finally, because we do not analyze the
content of our campaigns, we do not estimate how many of
our unsolicited calls fall into the “good” category (e.g., public
service announcements) and leave them for future work.
7 Related Work
Adversaries continue to thrive [34] in the era of modern tele-
phone networks. Even though researchers [35] have been
trying to make telephone networks more secure, end users are
constantly bombarded with spam calls [3, 36] and robocalls.
Some of the previously proposed techniques to combat spam
and fraud [37] in telephone networks employ graph analysis
[38–40], use decoys [41], apply machine learning [22,42–45]
and clustering techniques [46,47]. Other researchers associate
a custom metric for the calling number, like a trust value [48]
or a reputation score [49] to detect malicious callers.
The absence of end-to-end mutual authentication in phone
networks makes caller ID spooﬁng trivial. Tu et al. [50]
demonstrated that spoofed caller ID is a key factor in trick-
ing victims into revealing their private information, like their
Social Security Number. Caller ID spooﬁng also allows the
adversaries to operate without the fear of being tracked. To
address this issue, researchers have proposed in-band authenti-
cation techniques [51], pre-call authentication [52], improving
core SS7 protocol standards [53–55], developed mobile appli-
cations [56,57],initiating a call [58] to the calling party during
the ringing state, using a trusted third party [59] and coupling
SMS with call timing [60] to detect caller ID spooﬁng. The
IETF’s STIR working group [12] has recently proposed the
SHAKEN [61] framework which uses PASSporTs [62] and
certiﬁcates [63] to authenticate caller ID [64] in SIP networks.
But, these standards do not address the challenges in large
segments of non-SIP, TDM and analog circuits which are
still operational. By building on top of the Public Key Infras-
tructure (PKI) ideology, SHAKEN/STIR [65, 66] standards
inherit the risks of PKI [67] system designs.
Due to the inherent closed architecture of telephone net-
works, it is extremely challenging to collect real-world data
about how adversaries operate in the wild. Lack of data fur-
ther prevents us from applying spam detection and mitigation
techniques popular in email [68] and SMS [69–75] ecosys-
tems to telephone networks. To collect data and gain insights
about how adversaries operate, researchers have scraped web-
sites for audio transcripts [76, 77], used online text-to-speech
services to mimic robocallers [78] and generated calls in
a lab-controlled environment [42, 79]. We believe that such
strategies are inadequate in representing a constantly evolv-
ing real-world adversary. Also, user reported details could
be biased, inaccurate and under-represented. Numerous re-
searchers [3, 36, 68] have emphasized the need for collecting
and analyzing data from actual phone networks, which can in-
turn help in the development of robust mitigation techniques.
Techniques presented by Balasubramaniyan et al. [80] can be
useful to study the network path of a phone call as part of our
future work. Actively engaging with the caller [13,50,77] has
been an effective approach to gain deeper insights about the
adversary’s operational characteristics.
Honeypots [81] have served as a mechanism to collect
data about adversaries. Honeypots have been used to study
worms [82], email spam campaigns [83], SMS spam [71], so-
cial media campaigns [14, 84, 85], telephone networks [6, 86]
and much more. Previously developed telephony honeypots
have certain limitations and inherent assumptions. Gupta
et al. [6] and Li et al. [43] do not collect and process call
audio, while Balduzzi et al. [16] restrict themselves to spe-
ciﬁc geographic regions or languages, and Sahin and Fran-
cillon [17] use a small number of clean numbers. Previous
work [6, 16, 22, 23, 43] either used transcripts to identify clus-
ters of calls or did not account for caller ID spooﬁng, which
is prevalent in an adversarial telephone network settings. Our
data collection and campaign identiﬁcation techniques extend
far beyond each of them. The techniques proposed and used
in this paper are agnostic to caller ID spooﬁng and language
of the robocall. None of the prior work collect and analyze the
call meta-data, call audio content and signaling information
as a whole.
8 Conclusion
Robocalls and other forms of unsolicited phone calls have
plagued the telephone network. Such calls are a long-standing
problem to all people who use a phone. Despite anecdotal
evidence of the prevalence of such calls, accurate information
on the frequency of these calls is largely unknown. Through a
data-driven study, we provide details about the scale at which
unsolicited calling campaigns operate in the North American
phone network. By experimentation and statistical validation,
we ﬁnd no evidence that answering unsolicited calls increases

the number of such calls received. We develop mechanisms
to characterize voicemail spam, wangiri scam and different
forms of caller ID spooﬁng techniques. We develop, evaluate
and apply a robust campaign identiﬁcation technique using
call audio, and uncover 2,687 unique robocalling campaign
in the wild. Based on our observation, we discuss the state
of existing detection and mitigation techniques and call for
more data driven studies of the phone network.
