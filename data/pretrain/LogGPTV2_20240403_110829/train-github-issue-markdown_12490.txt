I just missed being able to drag and drop my selection. When one attempts to
drag a selection, Atom just makes a new selection, beginning at the point of
the drag and ending at the point of the drop. It should be possible to drag
and drop the selection around in the current buffer and between buffers. For
the latter, hovering above a buffer's tab should change the active buffer to
there. This would make reorganizing content more intuitive by giving the user
visual aid of what is being moved and where to.
