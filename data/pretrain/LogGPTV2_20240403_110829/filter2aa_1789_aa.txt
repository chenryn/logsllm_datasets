Music:   The Cools Kids – Gold and a Pager
The idea is the let the music play while folks enter the room then move on to
the next slide.
(Point out the obvious) Pager interception was once well documented and
“wildly” done within certain groups.  Therefore I’m no trailblazer or am I? Old
tech is not bad tech, its dated,
Its documented, but still useable and interesting. The idea is to re-
introduced the activity with some ideas that may of not been available in the
early to mid 90’s.
I want to stress again that OLD TECH IS NOT BAD TECH…if anything its
tried and tested.
*note* I probably should of removed or just covered up the text in that screen
capture… What do you see when you read it.

Quote (1) :  Pager interception has been done, therefore the path has been
made so how does this relate?  Things evolve over time this is no exception
so I encourage all to find the
                 new path.  The challenge to reinvent, rethink, and retool is open to
all… amateur SIGINT (radio monitoring) is a blast (expensive) join the ranks
and help the hobby.
Quote (2) : Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box.  Try your concepts
sometime things just work.

Okay off the bat lets agree that with the exception of niche markets pager
technology has been replaced. Cost used to be the factor that favored the
pager, that is no longer the case.  An advantage the pager will have as long
as its network is active, is signal penetration and strength.  The signal is
offset so that gaps or “shadows” are filled.  Once you get the setup
configured and going you’ll have hours of entertainment (For me this is the
case).
There is traffic and it can be juicy; e.g. several companies hold telephone
conference calls (which means they page the conf number and pass code,
which COULD lead to a non invited party to lurk on the line), SANDIA sends
msg similar to “Call Ralph at XYZ corp and here is his number”, DHS could
be sending out SA updates, DOT….., BOP offers the happenings of
correctional institutes (lock down or hey we found dope in a glassine bag
buried in inmate JOHN DOE’s anal cavity), Sporting events (numbers and
lines), the hospital data is disturbing due to the amount of info given out
(patients name and complaints, not to mention lab results), The phone
conferences are just asking to be recorded…
The thing to note is that this mode of communications is still in use and still
very much visible.  Keep in mind that at face value some data may not seem
useful and it may not be to some, BUT the fact is this sort of information is
what can be useable in SE operations.

Q: How do pagers work?
A: RF,  A intends to send a msg to B, A’s msg enters the network…. sat,
transmitters on cell phone towers
Common protocols are pocsag and flex in the US…
  These are the two I hear the most, therefore this is what I’ll cover.
Q: CapCodes?
A: unique ID’s, unit will only activate when it hears its ID/CAPCODE over the
air
Q:Data Slicers?
A: Converts analog and digital (FSK)
Q: Discriminator tap?
A: Base band audio
Q: illegal?
A: Not always
Note I’ve added golay/ermes BECAUSE when listening to online scanners

techniques are used.)
SIGnals INTelligence
    Disciplines:
       Targeting: Pager networks need for multiple.
       Coordinated rcvrs: ( This ideology is explored in the concepts segment
of this talk).  By deploying  “deployable” units or “linking” up with other
operations.  Not all subscribers
      have nationwide service, therefore having multi rcvrs would broaden
collections.
      Signal detection: Know the freq range then use the SA/Band Scope to
search for poss. Signal
      Traffic Analysis: Again knowing capcodes is important, by doing this you
begin to “map” the network, which enhances the
      entertainment value.
Q: The responsibility of knowledge?
A: You may see things that could be damaging but then again to share
would be illegal… BE SMART with what you find.
Q: What is good, what is crap, what may be useful down the line?
A: Research, I think this is the what makes the whole hobby worth wild for
me…

This will be extremely general assuming that most of this is common
knowledge. If the audience shows interest ( I will ask), I’ll mention the cost
verse function factor.  The main point is to stress that old tech doesn’t mean
it’s bad tech.

VHF and UHF signals that have high signal strength, with that said the stock
antenna should work fine.
Pre amp, if one where to be used it needs to be located outside at the
antenna.  For pager signals it is not needed, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea if
you’re trying to go after other signal types.
The antennas shown should be higher but due to the community I live in
putting them higher is not an option.

Cost: How much you plan to spend is up to you , but why go overboard when
you can buy a mobile within the
Needed freq range for so much cheaper (pro-84) or a desktop  (bd 855 xlt)
Mobility: This may be a concern for me it is not.
Ease of use: The Plug and Play (PNP) concept doesn’t always work. In radio
there are all sorts of models and
not every operator is as skilled as the as next.
