User: I'm running Windows and the shell/OS automatically runs Python based on the registry settings when you run a program on the command line. Will this break if I install a 2.x and 3.x version of Python on the same machine?
I want to play with Python 3 while still being able to run 2.x scripts on the same machine.
Assistant: I would assume so, I have Python 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 installed side-by-side on the same computer.
