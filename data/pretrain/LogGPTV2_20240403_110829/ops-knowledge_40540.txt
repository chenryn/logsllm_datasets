Question: In an effort to improve software security, a company is auditing their application to find design flaws that could contribute to vulnerabilities. They have identified a vulnerability related to the improper isolation of system-dependent functions. Which of the following approaches, if found during the audit, would NOT be a proper fix for the identified vulnerability?
"A": "Refactoring the code to define clear interfaces for system-dependent functionalities, separating them from the core logic of the application.",
"B": "Merging various system-dependent functionalities into a common utility class that is used throughout the application.",
"C": "Implementing a plugin architecture to allow system-dependent functionalities to be loaded and updated independently of the application core.",
"D": "Designing an abstraction layer that mediates between system-dependent functionalities and the application core, ensuring loose coupling."
Answer: B
