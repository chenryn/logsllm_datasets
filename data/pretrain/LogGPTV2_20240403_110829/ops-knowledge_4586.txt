Certainly! Below is an optimized and more professional version of the KQL (Kusto Query Language) query for identifying vulnerabilities related to the FireEye Red Team tool, specifically focusing on the Nobelium campaign. The query is designed to be clear, concise, and well-structured.

```kql
// Define the list of CVEs associated with the FireEye Red Team tool (Nobelium)
let FireEyeCVEs = dynamic([
    "CVE-2019-11510", // Pre-auth arbitrary file reading from Pulse Secure SSL VPNs - CVSS 10.0
    "CVE-2020-1472", // Microsoft Active Directory escalation of privileges - CVSS 10.0
    "CVE-2018-13379", // Pre-auth arbitrary file reading from Fortinet Fortigate SSL VPN - CVSS 9.8
    "CVE-2018-15961", // RCE via Adobe ColdFusion (arbitrary file upload that can be used to upload a JSP web shell) - CVSS 9.8
    "CVE-2019-0604", // RCE for Microsoft Sharepoint - CVSS 9.8
    "CVE-2019-0708", // RCE of Windows Remote Desktop Services (RDS) - CVSS 9.8
    "CVE-2019-11580", // Atlassian Crowd Remote Code Execution - CVSS 9.8
    "CVE-2019-19781", // RCE of Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Citrix Gateway - CVSS 9.8
    "CVE-2020-10189", // RCE for ZoHo ManageEngine Desktop Central - CVSS 9.8
    "CVE-2014-1812", // Windows Local Privilege Escalation - CVSS 9.0
    "CVE-2019-3398", // Confluence Authenticated Remote Code Execution - CVSS 8.8
    "CVE-2020-0688", // Remote Command Execution in Microsoft Exchange - CVSS 8.8
    "CVE-2016-0167", // Local privilege escalation on older versions of Microsoft Windows - CVSS 7.8
    "CVE-2017-11774", // RCE in Microsoft Outlook via crafted document execution (phishing) - CVSS 7.8
    "CVE-2018-8581", // Microsoft Exchange Server escalation of privileges - CVSS 7.4
    "CVE-2019-8394" // Arbitrary pre-auth file upload to ZoHo ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus - CVSS 6.5
]);

// Query to find devices with vulnerabilities matching the defined CVEs
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB
| where CveId in (FireEyeCVEs)
| join kind=inner DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities on CveId
| project-away CveId1, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel1, AffectedSoftware
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Definition**: 
   - The `FireEyeCVEs` variable is defined as a dynamic array containing the relevant CVEs. Each CVE is accompanied by a brief description and its CVSS score for context.

2. **Query Structure**:
   - The query filters the `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB` table to include only those records where the `CveId` is in the `FireEyeCVEs` list.
   - It then performs an inner join with the `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` table on the `CveId` field.
   - Finally, it projects away unnecessary columns (`CveId1`, `VulnerabilitySeverityLevel1`, and `AffectedSoftware`) to clean up the output.

This query should provide a clear and efficient way to identify and analyze the specified vulnerabilities in your environment.
