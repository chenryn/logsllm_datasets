User: I am able to find the name if the input file in a mapper class using FileSplit when writing the program in Java.
Is there a corresponding way to do this when I write a program in Python (using streaming?)
I found the following in the hadoop streaming document on apache:

See Configured Parameters. During the execution of a streaming job,
  the names of the "mapred" parameters are transformed. The dots ( . )
  become underscores ( _ ). For example, mapred.job.id becomes
  mapred_job_id and mapred.jar becomes mapred_jar. In your code, use the
  parameter names with the underscores.

But I still cant understand how to make use of this inside my mapper.
Any help is highly appreciated.
Thanks
Assistant: By parsing the mapreduce_map_input_file(new) or map_input_file(deprecated) environment variable, you will get the map input file name.  
Notice:
The two environment variables are case-sensitive, all letters are lower-case.
