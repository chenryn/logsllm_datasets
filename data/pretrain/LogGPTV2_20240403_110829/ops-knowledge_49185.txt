User: I am using a LocalExecutor and my dag has 3 tasks where task(C) is dependant on task(A). Task(B) and task(A) can run in parallel something like below
A-->C
B
So task(A) has failed and but task(B) ran fine. Task(C) is yet to run as task(A) has failed.
My question is how do i re run Task(A) alone so Task(C) runs once Task(A) completes and Airflow UI marks them as success.
Assistant: In the UI:

Go to the dag, and dag run of the run you want to change
Click on GraphView 
Click on task A
Click "Clear"

This will let task A run again, and if it succeeds, task C should run.
This works because when you clear a task's status, the scheduler will treat it as if it hadn't run before for this dag run.
