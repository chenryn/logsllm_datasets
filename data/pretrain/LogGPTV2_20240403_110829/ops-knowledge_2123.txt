User: Is it possible to collect the output of a python script using the "OS Process Sampler"?
My python script does a database query and returns "r1=123 r2=456 r3=789"
Is there a way to collect the r1, r2, r3 values and graph them?
Assistant: Hi you just have to print the data you need to pass to jmeter, and then use one  (or more) regular expression to extract values.
