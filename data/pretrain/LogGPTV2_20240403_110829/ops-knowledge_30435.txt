Assistant: Examples of automation solutions: Use the automation tool Jenkins to implement daily operation and maintenance tasks such as compilation, testing, deployment, and monitoring. 1. Compilation: Jenkins can support various programming languages and compilation tools through plug-ins, and can optimize the construction speed, such as parallel compilation. 2. Testing: Various testing frameworks can be integrated through Jenkins to automatically execute test cases, and it can also support test coverage analysis. 3. Deployment: Jenkins can configure automated deployment tasks, such as deploying applications to specified servers, and can also implement functions such as gray release and rollback. 4. Monitoring: It can integrate various monitoring tools, such as Zabbix, Nagios, etc., to monitor server performance, application status, etc., and can issue early warning notifications or automate specific operations. Using Jenkins can automatically solve the current IT daily operation and maintenance tasks, greatly improving efficiency and quality.
