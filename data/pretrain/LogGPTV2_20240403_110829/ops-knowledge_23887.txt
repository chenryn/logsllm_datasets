User: I have been asked to choose a project for my Operating System course at my university. I was bubbled with the idea of making an Operating System from scratch in Python. 
I have a few limitations: 

I have only 3 months. 
I want to do it in Python. 
I can put in say 20-30 hours every week into it. 

I want to know, how feasible is the idea? Like how far can I go in building the same. I would be very happy, if I can get a basic version running (something with a handful of very basic apps running.) Is it possible with the given limitations?
Is there a book that can help me like a guideline? (need not be for python, I just need a guide to tell me how I should go about making the OS)
If the idea is not feasible, can anyone tell me how much do I need to scale down my idea? 
Any help is much appreciated!
Assistant: You could probably code a small embedded-system OS in the timeframe you indicate, using concepts that are over a decade old.  Many newer operating systems require many more complicated scheduling and memory-management heuristics than would be typical in a small embedded OS; designing an entire modern OS would not be a practical single-person project, but one might be able to do something interesting with some subsystem of it.  I personally think there's some room for improvement in flash file systems, but I don't know what your prof would think.  What is your prof really looking for?
