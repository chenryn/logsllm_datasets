Later, [16] extended the Birnbaum Importance Measure (BIM) to measure the joint importance of \( k \) components. The extension is given by:
\[ S = \text{BIM}(S_0) \]

### Algorithm for Uncertainty Analysis

#### General Approach
1. `samplesList` // stores samples and their evaluated parameters
2. \( R_0 = \text{evaluate}(S_0) \)
3. \( \text{IM}_s = \text{BIM}(S_0) \)
4. For \( i = 1 \) to \( N_s \):
   5. \( S = \text{sample}() \)
   6. \( R = \text{TEvaluate}(S, S_0, R_0, \text{IM}_s) \)
   7. `samplesList.add(S, R)`
8. `statisticalAnalysis(samplesList)`

#### IM-Driven Sampling Approach
1. `samplesList` // stores samples and their evaluated parameters
2. \( R_0 = \text{evaluate}(S_0) \)
3. \( \text{IM}_s = \text{BIM}(S_0) \)
4. For \( i = 1 \) to \( N_s \):
   5. \( S = \text{IMSample}(\text{IM}_s) \)
   6. \( R = \text{TEvaluate}(S, S_0, R_0, \text{IM}_s) \)
   7. `samplesList.add(S, R)`
8. `statisticalAnalysis(samplesList)`

### Comparison of Algorithms for Uncertainty Analysis of Reliability at System Level

- **(a)**: Represents a general approach.
- **(b)**: Uses BIM for uncertainty analysis of system reliability according to Equation (4).
- **(c)**: Combines (b) with a new IM-driven sampling approach.

### Uncertainty Analysis of System Reliability Over Time

Figure 4 illustrates the uncertainty analysis of system reliability \( R(S) \) over time, given the uncertainty distributions of the components.

### Proposed Approximate Technique

Our proposed approximate technique extends the Taylor expansion introduced in Equation (4). We use this expansion to model uncertainties as changes in the system state, specifically as changes in the reliability function of components caused by uncertainties. The uncertainty of a component is denoted as \( \Delta R_i \), and its influence on the system's reliability is measured using Equation (4).

#### Process Steps
1. Set the initial state \( S_0 = (R_{01}, \ldots, R_{0N}) \) and evaluate the corresponding system reliability \( R(S_0) \) (referred to as \( R_0 \)).
2. Analyze the BIMs of the components for the initial state using the function `BIM(S_0)` and store them as \( \text{IM}_s \).
3. Calculate the reliability of state \( S = (R_1, \ldots, R_N) \) using the function `TEvaluate(S, S_0, R_0, \text{IM}_s)`, which implements Equation (4) where \( \forall 1 \leq i \leq N: \Delta R_i = R_i - R_{0i} \).

Using this approach, the BIMs are evaluated once, and the reliability of samples is calculated using low-overhead sum operations in the Taylor expansion. This avoids the costly re-evaluation of the system reliability model with respect to the component’s uncertainty. Thus, the proposed technique enables an extensible and affordable consideration of uncertainties with controllable execution time overhead. Moreover, the higher the reliability BIM of a component, the more its uncertainty contributes to the overall system uncertainty.

### Implementation Challenges

- **Small Changes in Component Reliability**: For small changes in the component’s reliability, such as \( |\Delta R_i| < 10^{-4} \), it holds that \( \Delta R_i \approx I_i(S_0) \cdot \Delta R_i \), where \( \Delta R_i \) is the change in the system reliability caused by the change only in component \( x_i \). This observation allows us to approximate the system reliability by taking only the initial terms of the Taylor expansion, called a Taylor polynomial.
- **Truncation of Negligible Terms**: The product of the joint BIM and \( \Delta R_i \) in Equation (4) tends to almost zero. We exploit this to enhance the efficiency of our reliability analysis by truncating the terms with negligible values.

### Design Considerations

- **Initial State Selection**: When the reliability of the components changes slightly, the initial state \( S_0 \) can be selected as either \( (R_{LB1}, \ldots, R_{LBN}) \) or \( (R_{UB1}, \ldots, R_{UBN}) \), where \( R_{LBi} \) and \( R_{UBi} \) are the lower and upper bounds of the reliability of component \( x_i \) when \( \lambda_i \) is at its lower and upper bounds, respectively. If this assumption does not hold, another state \( S_0 \) should be selected to ensure the changes remain relatively small.
