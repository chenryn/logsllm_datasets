are given.
to compute the reliability of a system in the presence of
uncertainty.
Our proposed approximate technique revolves around the
extension of the Taylor expansion introduced in Equation (4).
We employ the expansion to model uncertainties as changes
in the system state, in particular, as changes in the reliability
function of components caused by uncertainties. Based on
this, we consider the uncertainty of a component as ΔRi
and measure its inﬂuence on the reliability of the system
using Equation (4). This process is illustrated in Figure 3
(b). In Equation (4), we require to ﬁrst set the initial state
S 0 = (R0
N ) and evaluate the corresponding system
reliability R(S 0) (referred to as R0 in line 2 of this ﬁgure).
Next, we analyze the IMs of the components for the initial
state using function BIM (S 0) and store them as IM s. The
reliability of state S = (R1, . . . ,RN ) is calculated using func-
tion T Evaluate(S,S 0, R0, IM s). This function implements
1, . . . ,R0
Equation (4), where ∀1≤i≤N : ΔRi = Ri − R0
i .
Using this approach, the IMs are evaluated once for the
problem at hand and the reliability of samples (R(S)) is
calculated then using only low-overhead sum operations in
the Taylor expansion. This avoids the costly re-evaluation
of the system reliability model with respect to the compo-
nent’s uncertainty. Thus, the proposed technique enables an
extensible and affordable consideration of uncertainties with
controllable execution time overhead. Moreover, according to
this expansion, the higher the reliability IM of a component,
the more its uncertainty contributes to the overall system
uncertainty3.
For the implementation of Figure 3 (b), we faced some
challenges that we discuss here: The results in [10] show
that for small changes in the component’s reliability like
|ΔRi| < 10−4, it holds that ΔRi = Ii(S 0)· ΔRi where ΔRi
is the change in the system reliability caused by the change
only in component xi. We generalize this observation so that
when the reliability of the components changes slightly, we
can approximate the system reliability by taking only the initial
terms of the Taylor expansion, called a Taylor polynomial. This
corresponds to the fact that IM is a probability and the absolute
value of the joint IMs in Equation (2) diminishes when k
increases. Consequently,
the product of the joint IM and
ΔRi in Equation (4) tends to almost zero. We exploit
this observation to enhance the efﬁciency of our reliability
analysis by truncating the terms with negligible values.
