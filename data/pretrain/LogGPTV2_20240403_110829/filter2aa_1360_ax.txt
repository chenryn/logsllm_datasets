biggest hurdle with emulation. Consequently, there is finally an official fix, and an alternative option for advanced 
users. First, let's try the easy way by using the Genymotion built-in Google features.
• 
While inside our virtual Android device, click the "Open GzXPPS" icon in the upper right corner. Accept 
the agreement and allow Google Apps to install. Select the option to restart die devices.

Your browser should open to https://opengapps.org/?source=genymotion. Select "ARM64", the

Drag-and-Drop the downloaded zip file into your running Android device. zXccept any warnings. You 
may receive errors. When complete, close and restart the device.
z\ndroid Emulation 123
You should now have the Google Play Store in your applications menu. Launching it should prompt you to 
connect to an existing or new Google account. Consider using an anonymous account that is not used for 
anything else. 1 do not recommend creating a new account from within this virtual machine because Google will 
likely demand a cellular telephone number for verification. 1 prefer to create Google accounts from a traditional 
computer before connecting to the virtual zXndroid device. zXfter syncing with an active Google account on your 
new device, you should now be able to enter the Google Play Store. You should also now see all core Google 
services in your applications menu.

You can now install any apps within the Play Store. If any apps refuse to install because of an incompatible 
device, you could replicate the F-Droid and Aurora Store technique explained in the previous tutorial. The 
addition of Google Play will allow you to natively install Android applications as if you were holding a real 
telephone or tablet. Launch Google Play and you will be able to search, install, and execute most apps to your 
new virtual device. After you install a new program, click on the applications menu. Click and hold the new app 
and you will be able to drag it to your home screen. Figure 7.04 (left) displays the screen of my default 
investigation emulator. Next, you should understand the features embedded into the Genymotion software.

When you launch an z\ndroid virtual machine, you will see a column on the right side of the window and a row 
of icons horizontally on the bottom. The bottom icons are part of the emulated Android system. Clicking the 
first icon will navigate you backward one screen from your current location. If you are within an app, this would 
take you back one step each time that you press it. The second icon represents the "Home" option and will 
always return you to the home screen. The third button is the "Recent Apps" option and it will load a view of 
recently opened applications. The icons on the right of the emulator are features of Genymotion and allow you 
to control aspects of die Android machine from outside of the emulator. The following page displays this 
column of options, which should help explain each of these features. Note that many features are not available 
in the free version, but 1 have never found that to be a hindrance to my investigations. Genymotion is quite 
clear that if you plan on making money by designing an app through their product, you should pay for a license. 
Non-commercial usage allows unlimited use of the free personal version.
The GPS option within Genymotion is the most beneficial feature of their toolset. Clicking this icon and clicking 
the Off/On switch will execute the location spoofing service. You can cither supplv the exact coordinates 
directly or click on the Map" button to select a location via an interactive Google map. Figure 7.04 (middle) 
displays the default GPS menu in the disabled state. Figure 7.04 (right) displays coordinates entered. I 
recommend changing the altitude, accuracy, and bearing settings to "0". Close this window and you will see a 
green check mark in the GPS button to confirm that your location settings are enabled.

This collection reveals a folder tided "Tools" consisting of multiple files within it Technically, you have 
everything you need to replicate my once public search tools. However, it is up to you to modify these as needed. 
You will eventually want to remove dead sources, add new features, and modify the structures due to changes 
at third-party websites. 1 will use my Email Tool as a demonstration. Figure 8.01 displays the current view of 
the Email tool. As you can see, there are several individual search options and a "Submit All" feature at the 
bottom. Inserting an email address into any of these fields will query that address through the designated option, 
or the final field executes a search through all of them. Let's pick apart one of these queries from within the 
code. By default, double-clicking on any of the files within the search tool folder opens the selected option 
within your default web browser. This is required for any of them to function. In order to edit the files, we must 
open them within an HTML editing tool or any text processing application. If you are on a Mac, that could be 
TextEdit, Windows users have Notepad, and Linux users have Text Edit. All work fine for our needs. Lately, I 
prefer Atom (atom.io), which is a cross-platform free text editor.
I assumed my search tools would be around as long as I maintained my site. I learned the hard way that nothing 
lasts forever. We can no longer rely on third-party tools, a theme which 1 have overly-emphasized diroughout 
this entire book. Any online search tool outside of your control could disappear any day. That is not the worst 
possible outcome. We never truly know what information various online search tools are storing about our 
searches and activity. Many aggregated search sites possess numerous tracking cookies and practically all "link 
collections" force embedded analytics capturing data about every visitor. Creating and hosting your own tools 
eliminate these issues. We still must query sensitive data to a final repository of information, but let's eliminate 
the middle-man. 7111 of the tools presented in this chapter, and referenced throughout the book, do not need to 
be placed online within a website. You can store them on your computer and launch them without fear of 
questionable connections. Let's get started.
If you open the file titled email.search.html within a text editor (File > Open), you will see the code which makes 
this document function within a web browser. The following explains each section. Complete understanding of 
each term is not required to use and modify your own tools, but these pages may serve as a reference if you ever 
want to make substantial changes.
First, download a copy of all search tool templates used within the entire book. This can be found at 
https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/tools.zip. Enter a username of "osint9" and password of 
"bookl43wt" (without quotes) if required. Unzip this archive to a destination of your choice. If using the 
Linux, Mac, or Windows OS1NT builds which were previously explained, you should already have the necessary 
files on your Desktop. 1 always suggest saving them to the Desktop for easy access. However, anywhere should 
suffice. Be sure to extract all of the files within the zip file.
Custom Search Tools 129
From 2010 through 2019,1 offered a set of public free interactive online investigations tools. In June of 2019,1 
was forced to remove these tools due to abuse and legal demands. However, 1 never agreed to prevent others 
from creating their own sets or offering downloadable copies which can be run locally from any computer. In 
the previous edition of this book, I offered an offline version of these tools which could be self-hosted and 
immune from vague takedown requests. This chapter revisits these tools and offers several enhancements. The 
goal of this chapter is to help you create and maintain your own custom search tools which can automate queries 
for any investigation. First, let's talk about why this is so important.

This tells the page we want it to "do" something, and the task is called SearchOl.

This instructs the page to build a URL, add a piece of data, and open the result in a tab.
