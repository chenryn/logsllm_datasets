**Elasticsearch version** : 5.0.0-beta1
**Plugins installed** : []
**JVM version** : 1.8.0_72
**OS version** : Ubuntu 15
**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :  
As described here
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.0/search-suggesters-
completion.html#querying one can use source filtering while returning
suggestions under _suggest endpoint. However, using the source filtering
returns following error to me.

ba838a879c97.png)
**Steps to reproduce** :
  1. Follow examples mentioned on the above mentioned url for creating index with mapping and indexing document.
  2. Use following query for the suggestion  
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/music/_suggest" -d'  
{  
"_source": "completion.*",  
"song-suggest" : {  
"prefix" : "nir",  
"completion" : {  
"field" : "suggest"  
}  
}  
}'
**Looking at the documentation, i also wonder why to use completion.* as my
source filtered field. Shouldn't it be the name of the field which exist in
the document??**
_Surprisingly there is no exception thrown in Elasticsearch log file._
