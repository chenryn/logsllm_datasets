Additional information on Closed issue #8145 (I don't think I have permission
to re-open)
**TypeScript Version:**
1.8.9
Thanks for investigating.
I noticed you are using **tsc v1.8.10** to try to reproduce.
My globally-installed version is currently **1.8.9**.  
I think this version may have been installed with the recently-released VS
Code 1.0.  
It is with VS Code that I first encountered the issue - but it also occurs at
the command line (with **tsc v 1.8.9** )
As an experiment, I used a local NPM install of **tsc v.1.8.10**.
If i then invoke the compiler thus:
.\node_modules.bin\tsc -p .
the HelloWorld.js file is generated.
So, for information:
  1. Are you able to test this issue with **tsc v1.8.9**?  
and/or
  2. Is there a VS2015 tools installer for **tsc v1.8.10** (which seems to resolve the problem) I can use?
I usually use this link to install the Typescript compiler and VS2015 tooling:
