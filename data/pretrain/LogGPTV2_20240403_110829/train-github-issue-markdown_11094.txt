### Additional Information on Closed Issue #8145

**TypeScript Version: 1.8.9**

Thank you for investigating this issue.

I noticed that you are using **tsc v1.8.10** to try to reproduce the problem. My globally-installed version is currently **1.8.9**. I believe this version may have been installed with the recently-released VS Code 1.0. I first encountered the issue while using VS Code, but it also occurs when running the command line with **tsc v1.8.9**.

As an experiment, I performed a local NPM install of **tsc v1.8.10**. When I invoke the compiler using the following command:

```sh
.\node_modules\.bin\tsc -p .
```

the `HelloWorld.js` file is generated successfully.

For your information, I have two questions:
1. Are you able to test this issue with **tsc v1.8.9**?
2. Is there a Visual Studio 2015 tools installer available for **tsc v1.8.10** (which seems to resolve the problem)? If so, where can I find it?

I usually use the following link to install the TypeScript compiler and Visual Studio 2015 tooling:

Thank you for your assistance.
