Identifying a Photographer. The page URL and the page where a photo
is posted can provide important clues to reveal a photographer’s online iden-
tity. For instance, the URL https://plus.google.com/XYZ/photos suggests that
the photographer should have a Google+ [8] account with the ID of “XYZ”.
Following the URL allows us to retrieve more information about the photog-
rapher, such as her real name, college attended, current employer, and photos
posted on her account page. We have observed a great many such URL strings
in our dataset with photographers’ online social networks (OSNs) account IDs
embedded. The involved OSNs include but not limited to Flickr, Facebook [6],
Twitter [7], Google+, and 500px [9]. A photographer may have her multiple OSN
accounts disclosed in this way. Table 4 lists the information typically contained in
an account proﬁle of the ﬁve social networks mentioned above. It shows that an
account proﬁle typically contains demographics and other sensitive information
including age, gender, education, occupation, living city, other OSN accounts,
and much more. Once one OSN account is identiﬁed, the true identity of the
user in the real world can be readily disclosed.
Figure 10 shows the percentage of serial numbers from which we are able to
identify the corresponding camera owners’ IDs in one or more OSNs by scruti-
nizing the page URLs where the photos were posted. Among the 1,037 unique
serial numbers in our dataset, 51.4 % (533) of the serial numbers have the cam-
era owners’ OSN accounts identiﬁed, and 9.0 % (93) have account IDs in two or
more OSNs identiﬁed. And for one serial number we even identiﬁed the camera
owner’s four account IDs in four OSNs respectively.
As mentioned before, we were able to retrieve about 37 online photos on
average for a given serial number. Those photos tagged with the same serial
number may contain metadata information that could help identify the photog-
rapher. We closely examined the metadata information embedded in the related
photos for each of the remaining 504 serial numbers without any OSN accounts

identiﬁed in the previous step. Among them, we successfully identiﬁed the pho-
tographers for 116 serial numbers. Compared to the photographers with their
OSN accounts identiﬁed, the available information on those 116 photographers
are restricted to the photo metadata embedded, mainly including their names,
the processing softwares, and OSes used. However, more information could be
collected online once a person’s name is identiﬁed. Overall, 62.6 % (649) of serial
numbers have had their photographers identiﬁed.
7 Discussion
One goal of this work is to track the propagation of the sensitive metadata
information embedded in the digital photos at diﬀerent stages. One ideal way is
to monitor the process of creation, modiﬁcation, and elimination of the metadata
information contained in a same set of photos that sequentially experience three
stages—“fresh,” “intact,” and “wild.” However, it is very hard to obtain such
an ideal photo set in large-scale. Instead, we employed diﬀerent data collection
methods and obtained three kinds of photo sets to represent the digital photos
at the corresponding three stages.
We collected 612 valid “fresh” photos through crowdsourcing in a period of
two months. Each photo collected was taken by a unique participant with a
unique device, and participants from 76 countries contributed to this dataset. In
addition, those photos were solicited directly from smartphones and no photos
taken with digital cameras were collected in order to avoid data contamination.
Therefore, although the dataset size of “fresh” photos is not comparable to those
of “intact” and “wild” photos, its representativeness is high enough for this study.
To infer online media sites’ policies on handling metadata information in
the photos they host, we adopt a passive approach, that is, by examining the
metadata information of the photos collected from the sites. Actually, we once
considered to take an active approach to detect media sites’ policies, by sub-
mitting (uploading) diﬀerent types of photos to the sites, then re-downloading
them, and comparing metadata ﬁelds. However, we had to abandon this app-
roach because most of the 611 sites in the seven categories have speciﬁc user
groups and are not open to public registration, not to mention photo uploading.

Although it is known that a camera serial number can uniquely identify a
camera to some extent, we are not aware of any previous research work reveal-
ing potential threats arising from this attribute in an empirical and systematic
manner. We demonstrated the feasibility of re-identiﬁcation attack by exploiting
camera serial number. We were able to identify over 60 % of photo owners based
on their camera serial numbers available in a public online database.
When a user shares a digital photo online, two questions about privacy
issues are readily raised. One is whether sensitive hidden metadata informa-
tion is embedded in the photo. The other concerning question is what the media
site will do with the photo. According to our experiment results, a considerable
proportion of digital photos contain sensitive metadata information, and many
sites resize the photos they host or remove the embedded photo metadata infor-
mation. In our future work, we will develop a browser extension to give users
direct answers to these two questions.
The major functions that the tool should have are illustrated in Table 5.
Speciﬁcally, once the sensitive metadata information in a photo being uploaded
is detected, the browser extension should issue an alarm by popping up a window
on the screen and provide customized alert information, including the sensitive
metadata information embedded, the corresponding privacy risks, and the cur-
rent visiting site’s policy on photo handling. Note that the browser extension
should display the alert information only when the privacy-related metadata
information is detected, and thus it should not often interfere with normal photo
upload workﬂows. Although there are already browser extensions for photo meta-
data visualization, we will focus on informing users of the sensitive metadata
contained and customized privacy risks. Moreover, we will ensure users’ right to
know the actions that the hosting media sites will perform on their photos.
8 Related Work
Several previous works conduct user studies to understand users’ privacy deci-
sions during the photo sharing process and their privacy concerns on others’
photo-sharing activities. Clark et al. [11] revealed the problem of unintended
photo storage without users’ awareness, which is mainly caused by the automatic
features of cloud-based photo backup services. Ahern et al. [12] found that mobile
users’ decisions to post photos privately or publicly were determined more by
identity or impression concerns than security concerns. Besmer et al. [13] made
444

similar ﬁndings. They studied users’ perception of being tagged in undesired
photos uploaded by others. They found that a user’s privacy concerns on that
domain were mainly related to identity and impression management within her
existing social circles. Henne et al. [14] showed in their survey results that among
the information potentially disclosed by the tagged photos, personal references
and location data raised most privacy concerns.
More related to our work, several researchers examined the privacy threat
posed by the textual metadata information contained in online photos. Friedland
and Sommer [15] focused on the privacy threats posed by the geolocation
information available online. They showed that the geolocation data could be
exploited to mount privacy attacks using three scenarios on Craigslist, Twitter,
and YouTube, respectively. Pesce et al. [17] demonstrated that photo tagging on
Facebook could be exploited to enhance prediction of users’ information like gen-
der, city, and country. Another work from Mahmood and Desmedt [16] discussed
possible privacy violations from Google+’s policy that any users who access a
photo can see its metadata online. While the above three works addressed the
privacy issues with photos, we investigated the privacy issues with online photos
on a much larger scale. We assessed the privacy risks arising from leakage of
all possible sensitive metadata information rather than just geolocation data.
Moreover, our study is not restricted to one media site. Instead, we collect our
photo dataset from hundreds of top-ranked websites and through crowdsourcing
platforms. Those photos cover various stages, i.e., “fresh,” “intact,” and “wild.”
In addition, we introduce a new attack vector and show its unexpected power in
conducting a re-identiﬁcation attack. We also performed a large-scale measure-
ment of photo handling policies adopted by various categories of media sites.
Another large body of previous work has attempted to enhance people’s pri-
vacy when sharing photos online. Besmer et al. [22] designed a privacy enhance-
ment tool to improve the photo tagging process on Facebook. The tool allows
tagged users to negotiate online with the photo uploaders about the permission
settings on the photo. Fang and LeFevre [18] built a machine learning model for
OSN users to conﬁgure privacy settings automatically with a limited number of
rules provided. Zerr et al. [23] developed privacy classiﬁcation models for users
to search for private photos about themselves posted by others at an early stage.
Henne et al. [21] proposed a watchdog service that allows users to keep track of
potentially harmful photos uploaded by others at the expense of sharing their
location data with the service. Ra et al. [19] presented a selective encryption
algorithm that enables a photo to hide its “secret” part from the host photo-
sharing site and the unauthorized viewers and only expose its “public” part. Ilia
et al. [20] reﬁned the access control mechanism currently used by OSNs on photo
sharing. The new mechanism allows the depicted users in a photo to decide the
exposure of their own face, and could present photos with the restricted faces
blurred out to a visitor. Complementary to those works attempting to enhance
privacy on the web server side, this study assesses the privacy risks arising from
sensitive photo metadata and provides some guidelines for developing client-side
privacy leakage prevention tools, which should be able to alert online users of

potential privacy risks posed by uploading photos and also inform them of the
photo handling policies adopted by the currently visiting website.
To the best of our knowledge, we have conducted the ﬁrst large-scale empiri-
cal measurement study of the status of contemporary digital photos at the three
diﬀerent stages. In addition to examining the sensitive metadata information
embedded, we inferred the photo handling policies used by hundreds of top-
ranked sites, and proposed to exploit the camera identiﬁcation number as an
attack vector for re-identiﬁcation attack. We are not aware of any previous work
studying these topics.
9 Conclusion
In this paper, we performed a data-driven assessment of privacy risks on con-
temporary digital photos. We ﬁrst collected from the Web nearly 200,000 digital
photos at three diﬀerent stages as our dataset. Then for photos at each stage,
we measured the prevalence of metadata and assessed the privacy risks posed
by metadata leakage. We found that metadata is quite prevalent among digital
photos at each stage. In particular, 15 % of “fresh” photos, about 30 % “intact”
photos, and about 1 % “wild” photos were tagged with GPS coordinates. The
percentage of “wild” photos containing other sensitive metadata information is
also much lower than that of “intact” photos. A possible reason is that online
sites often remove the metadata information of the photos they host. Our spec-
ulation was conﬁrmed by our investigation of photo handling policies based on
nearly 100,000 photos crawled from 679 top sites in seven categories. We fur-
ther found that photo policies used by a site vary with the category that the
site belongs to. Finally, we proposed to use the camera serial number as a new
attack vector towards privacy inference and demonstrated its power in deriving
both online and real-world identities of a photographer with just one photo she
ever took. In our future work, we will build a browser extension prototype to
prevent users’ photo privacy leakage and increase their knowledge of the online
services’ policies on photo handling.

A Ethical Consideration
In our study, we leveraged several methods to collect photos, including: (1) solic-
iting “fresh” photos from crowdsourcing workers, (2) crawling photos from Flickr
using its API, (3) random Google Image Search, and (4) crawling top websites
for limited amounts of photos. Note that our crowdsourcing study has been vet-
ted and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at our institution.
