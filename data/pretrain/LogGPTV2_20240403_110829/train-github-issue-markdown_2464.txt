I think it might be a good add to let the user use buttons as prepend/addons.
There are a lot of uses for it (reseting a field, single-field submit button,
show field options etc) and it wouldn't be that hard to integrate. It just
needs a few CSS tweaks.
It's currently possible but the CSS result is rather messy :
