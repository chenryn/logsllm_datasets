The core issue is that the `flutter test` command on Linux requires the `libGLU.so.1` shared library, which is neither detected by the `flutter doctor` command nor listed as a requirement in the official documentation. According to issue #8493, there should be no dependency on this shared library. This suggests either @Hixie's assumption in the comment of #8493 is incorrect, or the dependency was reintroduced at some point.

To resolve this, you need to install the `libglu1-mesa` package.

Here are the relevant logs:

Checking for the `libGLU.so.1` dependency:

root@dc2bcbfdb26b:/bitrise/src/flutter-app-example# ldd /bitrise/src/flutter/bin/cache/artifacts/engine/linux-x64/flutter_tester | grep libGLU
        libGLU.so.1 => not found
```
