The real problem is that `flutter test` command on linux requires
`libGLU.so.1` but it's lack is neither detected by doctor nor listed as a
requirement in documentation.
According to #8493 there should be no dependency on that shared library. So
either @Hixie's assumption from #8493 (comment) is wrong or it was just
introduced again in the meantime.
Fix consists of installing `libglu1-mesa`.
Here are the logs:
