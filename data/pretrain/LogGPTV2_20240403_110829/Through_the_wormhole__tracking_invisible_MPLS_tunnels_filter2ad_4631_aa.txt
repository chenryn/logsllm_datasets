## Abstract
For years, Internet topology research has relied on active measurements. For example, CAIDA constructs router-level topologies using IP-level traces obtained from traceroute. The resulting graphs often contain nodes with very high degrees, which may exceed the actual number of interfaces on a router. While this property can result from inaccurate alias resolution, we believe that opaque MPLS clouds, consisting of invisible tunnels, are the primary cause. Using Layer-2 technologies like MPLS, routers can be configured to hide internal IP hops from traceroute, making an entry point of an MPLS network appear as the neighbor of all exit points and turning the entire Layer-3 network into a dense mesh of high-degree nodes.

This paper addresses three main issues: revealing hidden IP hops in MPLS tunnels, underestimating MPLS deployment, and overestimating high-degree nodes. We develop new measurement techniques to detect the presence and content of invisible MPLS tunnels. These techniques are evaluated through emulation and cross-validation, and we conduct a large-scale measurement campaign targeting suspicious networks, applying statistical analysis. Finally, we examine the impact of invisible tunnels on basic graph properties based on our dataset.

## 1. Introduction
Since the late 1990s, extensive research has been conducted on Internet topology discovery. Various analyses have been proposed to describe different types of connectivity structures and representations of the Internet architecture. Inferring the router-level topology of IP networks is crucial for studying routing characteristics. These topologies are derived by grouping IP addresses collected via traceroute, a process known as alias resolution. Understanding the architecture of an Autonomous System (AS) is also essential for analyzing the performance of routing protocols. Using random graph models instead of realistic networking topologies can lead to biased or incorrect conclusions. For instance, the performance of fast-rerouting schemes and multipath transport protocols heavily depends on the underlying topology.

Typically, router-level topologies are undirected graphs built from IP-level traces obtained through traceroute. Statistical analysis of these graphs, particularly the node degree distribution, has been a focus of research. However, a significant number of nodes exhibit very high degrees, often exceeding the actual number of interfaces on a router. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors, including the limited number of vantage points in traceroute campaigns and the presence of Layer-2 (L2) clouds, such as Ethernet switches, which interconnect a large number of Layer-3 (L3) routers.

In this paper, we investigate another reason for high-degree nodes (HDNs) in the Internet graph: opaque MPLS clouds that hide their content from traceroute. MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a technology designed to speed up forwarding decisions but is now mainly used for IGP/BGP scalability, virtual private network (VPN) services, and traffic engineering. MPLS is widely deployed by operators, as confirmed by our survey, where 87% of surveyed operators use MPLS. Unfortunately, ISPs may want to hide the structure and configuration of their internal MPLS networks, leading to invisible MPLS tunnels. This results in incomplete data from traceroute measurements and potentially biased Internet maps.

Our goal is to address these issues by proposing new probing mechanisms and analyses. Our contributions are threefold:
1. Development and validation of new active measurement techniques based on traceroute and TTL estimation, which can reveal the presence and content of invisible tunnels.
2. Collection and analysis of a specific dataset to improve the understanding of MPLS deployment and ISP practices.
3. Illustration of how to correct biases in classical Internet topology models in terms of node degree, route length distributions, and graph density.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the necessary background. Section 3 presents and validates our measurement techniques. Section 4 details the deployment of these techniques. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 discusses ISP practices in deploying MPLS tunnels. Section 7 reviews basic Internet modeling features based on revealed invisible MPLS tunnels. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 MPLS
MPLS routers, or Label Switching Routers (LSRs), exchange labeled packets over Label Switched Paths (LSPs). These packets are tagged with one or more label stack entries (LSEs) inserted between the frame header (data-link layer) and the IP packet (network layer). Each LSE consists of four fields: an MPLS label for forwarding, a Traffic Class field for quality of service and priority, a bottom of stack flag bit, and a time-to-live (LSE-TTL) field.

The first MPLS router (Ingress LER) adds the label stack, while the last MPLS router (Egress LER) removes it. In most cases, the penultimate LSR (Last Hop) removes the top LSE, a process called Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP). This reduces the load on the Egress LER. Ultimate Hop Popping (UHP) is less common and is used for sophisticated traffic engineering operations.

Labels are allocated through the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or RSVP-TE. LDP is used for scalability, while RSVP-TE is used for traffic engineering. Most operators use both LDP and RSVP-TE, as confirmed by our survey.

### 2.2 Measuring MPLS Tunnels
LSRs can send ICMP time-exceeded messages when the LSE-TTL expires. If the LSR implements RFC 4950, it includes the MPLS LSE stack in the message. If the Ingress LER copies the IP-TTL value to the LSE-TTL field, LSRs along the LSP will reveal themselves via ICMP messages. Operators can configure this transparency using the `ttl-propagate` option.

Invisible MPLS tunnels are those completely obscured from traceroute. The Ingress LER does not enable `ttl-propagate`, and the Last Hop does not send back an ICMP time-exceeded message. Due to PHP, the Last Hop converts the MPLS packet to a standard IP packet without decrementing the IP-TTL, hiding all IP hops inside the tunnel.

### 2.3 Network Fingerprinting
Router fingerprinting techniques classify networking devices based on their hardware and OS. This method infers initial TTL values used by a router when generating reply packets, building a router signature. Vanaubel et al. [40] presented a technique for this purpose.
