User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Questions on true anonymity I am going to use Tails to connect to Tor through VPN which has AES-256 data encryption, SHA-256 data authentication and RSA-4096 handshake encryption on my Mac on my school's WiFi (as public as I can get).

Is there anything I can do to make it more anonymous and make it so that no one can trace me back? Maybe I could have a program that bounces my IP address across servers, etc. 

Edit: my school does not required log in, it does not have any password either. I have 4 other Facebook account none of which uses my real name.

Assistant: Even if Tails offers  anonymity and coming with default built-in encryption suites for different purposes, your anonymity is already compromised since as in all schools/universities we find the same policy: to use their WiFi they need to be sure you are either a student, a teacher or an authorized person to access their Wifi. 

Also you must remember that  Tor browser as well as the whole Tails operating system privacy-protecting flaws show that no anonymity system is fail-safe: you need to keep yourself Tails/Tor up-to-date to security issues as mentioned in this recent May 2015 report where it is stated that when it comes to anonimity:


  there is no magic or perfect solution to such a complex problem.


Some vulnerabilities listed from that report:


Tor exit nodes can eavesdrop on communications
Tails makes it clear that you are using Tor and probably Tails
Man-in-the-middle attacks
Confirmation attacks
