### 2.3.4 Provider Network Performance/Activities

We analyze SNMP and syslog data collected from the provider network. Table 3 shows the distribution of different types of syslog messages observed on devices in the SHO (Super Head Office) and VHOs (Video Head Offices). Our focus is on performance-related events. We observe that Layer-1 alarms and IP link flaps contribute to over 55% of the events. Additionally, Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP) related issues account for approximately 16% of events. These protocols are used for multimedia communication sessions, and their issues may potentially impact IPTV performance.

**Figure 4: Cumulative Distribution of Inter-Arrival Time of Provider Network Syslog Messages at VHO and SHO**

- **Layer-1 Alarm**
- **IP Link Flaps**
- **SAP State Changes**
- **OSPF Routing Events**

The figure illustrates the cumulative distribution of inter-arrival times for the top four syslog messages listed in Table 3. The high temporal locality observed in the figure indicates that these events tend to occur in clusters.

### 2.3.5 Daily Pattern of Events

**Figure 5: Daily Pattern of STB Crash, STB Resets, STB Turn ON, STB Turn OFF, Customer Trouble Tickets, and Provider Network Syslogs**

- **STB Crash**
- **STB Reset**
- **STB Turn ON**
- **STB Turn OFF**
- **Trouble Ticket**
- **Provider Network Syslog**

The time is represented in GMT. We observe significant activity (STB events and customer trouble tickets) between 00:00 GMT and 04:00 GMT, which corresponds to evening prime time in North America, and between 12:00 GMT and 23:59 GMT, which is daytime in North America. There is a relative "quiet" period between 04:00 GMT and 12:00 GMT, when customers are likely sleeping.

During this time window, the number of syslog messages at SHOs and VHOs in the provider network can be very high. This can be attributed to network provisioning and maintenance activities. Overall, we find that the more customers watch TV, the more performance issues occur and are reported.

### 2.4 A Case for Multi-Resolution Analysis

As discussed earlier, the IPTV network serves about a million residential customers. The network operator needs to identify and troubleshoot performance problems across millions of devices, ranging from those in SHOs and VHOs inside the provider network to residential gateways and STBs on customers' home networks.

One approach to tackle this problem is to identify a few "heavy hitter" devices where performance issues are significant. This is a standard approach in IP network troubleshooting, where the operation team focuses on a few chronic problems that contribute to the majority of performance issues. However, this approach does not hold for the IPTV network. Figure 6 shows the number of events observed in the IPTV network over a three-month period. We find that while there are a few heavy hitters, their contribution is only a small fraction of the total events. Non-heavy hitters contribute to the vast majority of events. Therefore, focusing on a few heavy hitters is insufficient to troubleshoot most performance issues in an IPTV network.

Additionally, we observe that the occurrence of a given event on an individual device is extremely low. For example, as shown in the embedded plots in Figure 6, about half of the residential gateways do not have a single reboot event during the three-month study period. Only about 20% of set-top boxes experienced native or managed crash events, with watchdog reboots and out-of-memory crashes being even rarer.

To address these challenges, we propose using multi-resolution analysis by detecting hierarchical heavy hitters across multiple spatial granularities such as DSLAM, CO, Metro, and Region. Note that the distribution of the number of set-top boxes and residential gateways per spatial aggregation is not uniform (as shown in Figure 7), indicating that standard hierarchical heavy hitter detection algorithms cannot be directly applied.

### 3. The Design of Giza

In this section, we present the design of Giza, a multi-resolution data analysis infrastructure for analyzing and troubleshooting performance problems in IPTV networks. Giza includes a suite of statistical techniques for prioritizing various performance issues, event-correlation detection, dependency-graph reduction, causality discovery, and inference.

One of the key challenges in managing IPTV services is the massive scale, particularly in terms of network edge devices, leading to an overwhelming amount of performance monitoring data such as device usage and error logs, user activity logs, detailed network alarms, and customer care tickets. It is crucial for network operators to quickly focus on prevailing and repeating problems and automate the process of root cause analysis and troubleshooting. Giza is designed to address these needs of IPTV network operators.

**Figure 8: Architecture of Giza**

- **Inputs**: Performance impairment events and specific time frame of interest.
- **Outputs**: Causality graph for troubleshooting.

Giza first performs a multi-resolution analysis to eliminate areas of the network that do not have significant observations of the input symptom events. This is achieved through a hierarchical heavy hitter detection component. The locations may be at any aggregation level in the DSLAM, CO, Metro, and Region hierarchy. Focusing on locations where symptom events are dominant reduces the amount of data processing required for later steps. Next, Giza explores a wide range of other event series extracted from various system logs and performance monitoring data, identifying those that are correlated with the symptoms using a statistical correlation discovery component. This is done at an appropriate spatial granularity where the symptom events and diagnostic events can relate. Furthermore, Giza applies a novel causality discovery approach to deduce the causality graph and identify potential root causes. The output of Giza is a causality graph that is highly valuable for the troubleshooting efforts of network operators.

### 3.2 Hierarchical Heavy Hitter Detection

In this subsection, we present the design of our hierarchical heavy hitter detection component. The goal is to identify spatial locations where a given performance impairment is prevalent and recurring, and prune the remaining locations to reduce complexity for subsequent phases.

Detecting heavy hitters (locations with significant occurrences of the symptom network event) in a single-dimensional data typically involves setting an appropriate threshold. For example, if STB crashes are the symptom event, heavy hitter STBs can be defined as those that crash more than k times in an hour. However, considering the hierarchical structure of an IPTV network, a proper definition of a heavy hitter should include both the event frequency (temporal property) and the density concentration (spatial property). For instance, a DSLAM with 10 STBs experiencing 1000 crashes is more significant than a DSLAM with 1000 STBs having the same number of crashes in the same period. A concentration reported at a lower level in the hierarchy provides more specific information and is more valuable than a heavy hitter reported at a higher level. With these design considerations in mind, we present our significance test for a hierarchical heavy hitter.
