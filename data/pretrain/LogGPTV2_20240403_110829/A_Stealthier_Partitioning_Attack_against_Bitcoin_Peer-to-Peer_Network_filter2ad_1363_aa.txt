## Abstract
Network adversaries, such as malicious transit autonomous systems (ASes), have been shown to be capable of partitioning the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network via routing-level attacks, such as BGP prefix hijacking. However, such hijacking is globally observable, enabling immediate detection and identification of the perpetrator. In this paper, we present a stealthier attack, called the EREBUS attack, which partitions the Bitcoin network without any routing manipulations, making it undetectable to both control-plane and data-plane detectors. The novel aspect of EREBUS is that it makes the adversary AS a natural man-in-the-middle for all the peer connections of one or more targeted Bitcoin nodes by influencing their peering decisions. We show that affecting the peering decision of a Bitcoin node, previously believed to be infeasible after bug patches against the Eclipse attack, is possible for a network adversary with abundant network address resources. The EREBUS attack is readily available for large ASes, such as Tier-1 and large Tier-2 ASes, against the vast majority of 10K public Bitcoin nodes with a modest attack traffic rate and execution period. The EREBUS attack can be mounted by nation-state adversaries who are willing to execute sophisticated attack strategies to compromise cryptocurrencies. Since the attack exploits the topological advantage of being a network adversary rather than specific vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin core, no quick patches seem to be available. We discuss why naive solutions like whitelisting and rate-limiting are ineffective and how third-party proxy solutions may worsen Bitcoin's centralization problem. We provide suggested modifications to the Bitcoin core and show that they effectively make the EREBUS attack significantly harder, but their non-trivial changes to Bitcoin's network operation should be thoroughly examined before wide deployment.

## 1. Introduction
The robust consensus among large numbers of untrusted nodes is a critical technical underpinning of cryptocurrencies, achieved through highly dependable peer-to-peer networks. The Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, in particular, has been a target of various attacks. Notably, the Bitcoin hijacking attack [3] demonstrates that a network adversary (e.g., a Tier-1 or Tier-2 transit AS) can manipulate inter-domain routes to partition the network. This attack exploits the well-known BGP prefix hijacking vulnerability to redirect all peer connections of selected nodes to the adversary AS, controlling their communications.

However, the Bitcoin hijacking attack has a significant drawback: the real identity of the perpetrator (i.e., the malicious AS) is immediately revealed due to the nature of BGP operations. This can be a critical disadvantage for large ASes with reputations.

In this paper, we present a stealthier attack, called the EREBUS attack, which allows a network adversary to control the peer connections of a targeted Bitcoin node without any route manipulation, leaving no control-plane evidence of the attack. Since the attack uses only data-plane messages, it remains undetected by control-plane monitoring systems. The EREBUS attack is feasible for Tier-1 or large Tier-2 ISPs, targeting the vast majority of 10K Bitcoin nodes that accept incoming connections. Nation-state adversaries, who may control large transit ISPs, can mount the EREBUS attack.

Figure 1 illustrates the high-level overview of the EREBUS attack, showing how an adversary AS manages to control all peer connections of a targeted victim Bitcoin node by changing its outgoing peering connections to new connections with carefully chosen Bitcoin nodes whose paths include the adversary AS. This places the adversary AS on the paths of all the peer-to-peer connections of the victim node.

## 2. Background: Partitioning Bitcoin Nodes
### 2.1 Motivations for Partitioning Bitcoin Network
- **Attacking Bitcoin Consensus:** An adversary can waste mining efforts by stalling the transmission of the latest blockchain state to a set of miners. Partitioning a fraction of miners (e.g., 30%) from the rest of the network can enable a 51% attack, even if the adversary does not control the majority of the mining power. Additionally, the adversary can hijack the computation power of partitioned miners for selfish mining attacks or double-spending attacks.
- **Attacking Bitcoin’s Off-Chain Protocols:** Marcus et al. [31] describe an attack on off-chain protocols, such as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, where the adversary prevents the partitioned victim node from settling payment channels and steals funds from off-chain transactions.
- **Taking Down Cryptocurrencies:** A powerful adversary, such as a nation-state attacker, may aim to disrupt a large portion of the underlying peer-to-peer network, arbitrarily censoring transactions from the victim.

### 2.2 Bitcoin Hijacking and Drawbacks
The Bitcoin hijacking attack [3] uses BGP hijacking to control the traffic toward the most-specific IP prefixes of targeted Bitcoin nodes. While this attack can isolate the targeted nodes from the rest of the network, it reveals the attacker's identity immediately, as BGP hijacking messages are propagated globally and observed by route monitoring systems. This is a serious disadvantage for large network adversaries with established reputations.

### 2.3 Eclipse Attacks and Countermeasures
The Eclipse attack [29] directly manipulates the victim Bitcoin node's peer selection decision by filling its internal database with arbitrary IP addresses. The Bitcoin community patched these vulnerabilities, making it much harder for attackers to fill the new table and rendering the Eclipse attack infeasible for adversaries with botnets.

## 3. Overview of the EREBUS Attack
### 3.1 Threat Model
We consider a network adversary with full control of a single AS, which we call an adversary AS. The adversary can insert, modify, remove, or delay any messages traversing her network. The goal is to control all the peer connections of a target node in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. We target around 10K Bitcoin nodes that accept incoming connections, excluding nodes behind NATs or connected via Tor bridges. We assume the targeted nodes have reliable IP addresses during the attack execution period.

### 3.2 Naive EREBUS Attack
The naive EREBUS attack involves a malicious AS (e.g., AS M) targeting a benign Bitcoin node (e.g., a node in AS V). The attack forces the victim node to connect to other benign Bitcoin nodes (e.g., nodes in AS C or D) so that the changed peer connections traverse the adversary AS. The adversary repeats this until it serves all the peer connections of the victim node, becoming a natural man-in-the-middle network.

### 3.3 Full EREBUS Attack
From the high-level intuition of the naive version, we now present the full EREBUS attack. The key challenges include finding a sufficient number of benign Bitcoin nodes whose communication paths to the victim node include the adversary AS and influencing the peer selection of the victim node. We show that these challenges can be overcome by a network adversary with abundant network address resources, making the EREBUS attack feasible and stealthy.

## 4. Conclusion
The EREBUS attack presents a significant threat to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network by allowing a network adversary to control the peer connections of targeted nodes without any detectable route manipulation. We discuss the limitations of current countermeasures and suggest several effective modifications to the Bitcoin core. These modifications, while making the EREBUS attack significantly harder, require thorough examination before wide deployment due to their non-trivial changes to Bitcoin's network operation.
