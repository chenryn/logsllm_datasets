Subject: Issue with Tooltip/Popover Arrow Position When Resizing Window

Hello,

I have noticed an issue with the position of the arrow in a tooltip or popover. When I resize the window, the arrow's position changes from the bottom to the center of the tooltip/popover.

To illustrate the problem, I have created a JSFiddle and included some screenshots below:
