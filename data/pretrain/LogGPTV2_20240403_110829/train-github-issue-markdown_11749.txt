When using the Google search button on scikit-learn.org, the results are displayed in a manner that overlaps with the index page, as shown in the following screenshot:

However, when I perform the same action on the local version of the documentation (generated using `make doc-noplot`), the search functionality works perfectly, as illustrated below:

It appears that the size of the `header-wrapper` is not being updated correctly when the search button is clicked. This issue might be due to the website on GitHub not being up-to-date. Could you please verify if the latest changes have been deployed?
