Fig. 7. Results of experiment 1: Impact of distance to a set of attack steps. (a) Generic
Bayesian network used. (b) Using node 24 as the detector (evidence), the line shows
mean values for rate of change. (c) Comparison between diﬀerent detectors as evidence,
showing the mean rate of change for case.
The results show that a detector can aﬀect nodes inside a radius of up to
three edges from the detector. The change in probability for a node within this
radius, compared to one outside the radius, can be two times greater when the
detector is used as evidence. For all Bayesian networks tested, the results were
consistent to the three edges radius observation.
5.2 Experiment 2: Impact of Imperfect Knowledge
The objective of experiment 2 was to determine the performance of the detection
system in the face of attacks. In the ﬁrst part of the experiment (Exp 2a), the

Bayesian network. The line with square markers is recall and other line is for precision.
eﬀect of the threshold, that is used in converting the conditional probability of
an attack step into a binary determination, is studied. This corresponds to the
practical situation that a system administrator has to make a binary decision
based on the result of a probabilistic framework and there is no oracle at hand
to help. For the second part of the experiment (Exp 2b), the CPT values in
the Bayesian network are perturbed by introducing variances of diﬀerent magni-
tudes. This corresponds to the practical situation that the system administrator
cannot accurately gauge the level of diﬃculty for the adversary to achieve attack
goals. The impact of the imperfect knowledge is studied through a ROC curve.
For Exp 2a, precision and recall were plotted as a function of the threshold
value. This was done for all the attack nodes in the Bayesian network and the
results for a representative sample of six nodes are shown in Figure 8. We used
threshold values from 0.5 to 0.95, since anything below 0.5 would imply the
Bayesian network is useless in its predictive ability.
Expectedly, as the threshold is increased, there are fewer false positives and the
precision of the detection system improves. The opposite is true for the recall of the
system since there are more false negatives. However, an illuminating observation is
that the precision is relatively insensitive to the threshold variation while the recall
has a sharp cutoﬀ. Clearly, the desired threshold is to the left of the cutoﬀ point.
Therefore, this provides a scientiﬁc basis for an administrator to set the threshold
for drawing conclusions from a Bayesian network representing the system.
In experiment 2b we introduced variance to the CPT values of all the at-
tack nodes, mimicking diﬀerent levels of imperfect knowledge an admin may

Fig. 10. Impact of deviation from correct CPT values, for the (a) e-commerce and (b)
generic Bayesian networks
have about the adversary’s attack strategies. When generating the samples corre-
sponding to the attacks, we used three variance values: 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25. Each
value could be associated with a diﬀerent level of knowledge from an adminis-
trator: expert, intermediate, and nave, respectively. For each variance value, ten
batches of 1,000 samples were generated and the detection results were averaged
over all batches.
In Figure 9, we show the ROC curves for nodes 1 and 6 of the e-commerce
system, with all four detectors in place. Expectedly, as the variance increases,
the performance suﬀers. However, the process of Bayesian inference shows an
inherent resilience since the performance does not degrade signiﬁcantly with the
increase in variance. For node 1, several points are placed so close together that
only one marker shows up. On the contrary, for node 6, multiple well spread out
TP-FP value pairs are observed. We hypothesize that since node 1 is directly
connected to the detector node 3, its inﬂuence over node 1 dominates that of all
other detectors. Hence fewer number of sharp transitions are seen compared to
node 6, which is more centrally placed with respect to multiple detectors.
Experiment 2c also looked at the impact of imperfect knowledge when deﬁning
the CPT values in the Bayesian network. Here we progressively changed the CPT
values for several attack steps in order to determine how much we would deviate
from the correct value. We used two values 0.6 and 0.8 for each CPT cell (only
two are independent) giving rise to four possible CPT tables for each node. We
Determining Placement of Intrusion Detectors

plot the minimum and maximum conditional probabilities for a representative
attack node for a given detector ﬂagging. We change the number of CPTs that
we perturb from the ideal values. Expectedly as the number of CPTs changed
increases, the diﬀerence between the minimum and the maximum increases, but
the range is within 0.03. Note that the point at the left end of the curve for zero
CPTs changed gives the correct value.
Both experiments indicate that the BN formalism is relatively robust to im-
perfect assumptions concerning the CPT values. This is an important fact since
it is likely that the values determined by an experienced system administra-
tor would still be somewhat imperfect. Overall, as long as the deviation of the
assumed CPTs from the truth is not overwhelming, the network performance
degrades gracefully.
5.3 Experiment 3: Impact on Choice and Placement of Detectors
The objective of experiment 3 was to determine the impact of selecting the
detectors and their corresponding locations. To achieve this, we ran experiments
on the e-commerce and the VoIP Bayesian networks to determine a pair of
detectors that would be most eﬀective. This pair, called the optimal pair, is
chosen according to the algorithm described in Section 3.2. The performance of
the optimal pair is compared against additional pairs selected at random. We
