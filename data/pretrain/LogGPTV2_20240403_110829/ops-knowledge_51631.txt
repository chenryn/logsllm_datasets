User: Analyze the possible failure causes of the phenomenon, and give a solution. After all the clickhouse clusters are stopped, the ddl statements such as truncate and alter use on cluster when restarting. Occasionally, zookeeper synchronization exceptions occur, and clickhouse fails to start.
Assistant: Create the force_restore_data file in the clickhouse data directory with the user authority owner of clickhouse on all nodes of the cluster. The specific operation steps are as follows: 1. Use the command sudo -u demo to log in to any node of the clickhouse cluster. 2. Enter the clickhouse data directory, such as /data/appData/clickhouse. 3. Use the command touch to create the force_restore_data file. The command is as follows: sudo -u demo touch /data/appData/clickhouse/flags/force_restore_data. 4. Make sure the force_restore_data file exists on all nodes. 5. Restart the clickhouse cluster and the problem should be resolved.
