User: Does anyone know where or how to set the default path/directory on saving python scripts prior to running?  
On a Mac it wants to save them in the top level ~/Documents directory. I would like to specify a real location. Any ideas?
Assistant: On Windows (Vista at least, which is what I'm looking at here), shortcut icons on the desktop have a "Start in" field where you can set the directory used as the current working directory when the program starts.  Changing that works for me.  Anything like that on the Mac?  (Starting in the desired directory from the command line works, too.)
