### Network Configuration and False Accusation Tests

#### Network Configurations
The 38-node configuration was derived by removing 5 random nodes from the 43-node configuration, and similarly, the 33-node configuration was created by discarding 5 more random nodes from the 38-node configuration. For each network density, three runs were conducted using different random seeds (A, B, or C) to determine the initial headings of the nodes. All runs utilized the attacker positioning and mobility scenario described in Section 5.3. However, unlike the wormhole detection test, the false accusation tests involved continuous node mobility.

#### Terminology for False Accusation Test Results
To clarify the results of the false accusation tests, we introduce the following terminology:
- **Corroborated False Accusation (FA):** A false accusation against a victim link, supported by anomalous measurements reported by at least two independent pairs of observers.
- **Unsuccessful FA:** A false accusation reported by a single pair of observers but not corroborated by other independent pairs. The prototype detector is designed to ignore uncorroborated accusations.
- **Successful FA:** A corroborated FA that is not outvoted by an equal or greater number of normal measurement reports from independent pairs of honest nodes, indicating that the attackers prevail.
- **Suppressed FA:** A corroborated FA that is outvoted by an equal or greater number of normal measurement reports from independent pairs of honest nodes, indicating that the honest nodes prevail.

#### Summary of One-Hour Test Runs
Table 1 summarizes the results of the twelve false accusation test runs. The average node degree (number of one-hop neighbors per node) ranged from 4.75 to 7.42. The duration during which links were subjected to corroborated FAs ranged from 583 to 2,202 link-seconds. The number of links subjected to corroborated FAs ranged from 23 to 69. These statistics indicate that the amount of "interesting" FA data generated varied significantly with network density. In total, these runs generated 13,481 link-seconds of FAs against 473 victim links, providing a significant volume of interesting data.

#### Effectiveness of Opportunistic Voting
Figure 8 illustrates the overall effectiveness of opportunistic voting in suppressing FAs across the test runs. Effectiveness is defined as the percentage of link-seconds during which FAs were suppressed by pairs of honest observers. Suppression rates ranged from 57% (run 33B) to 81% (run 43A), with an overall weighted average of 72%. The weights reflect the amount of FA data generated during each run.

#### Analysis of Successful FAs
As shown in Table 1, 473 links were subjected to FAs, with 234 links experiencing successful FAs. Figure 10 provides a per-link lifetime analysis of the 234 successfully accused links, showing that no link was successfully accused for more than 14% of its lifetime. Conversely, for at least 86% of the lifetime of every link, the link was either not subjected to corroborating accusations or the accusations were suppressed by honest outvoting. The vast majority (212) of the 234 links were successfully accused for less than 5% of their lifetimes.

#### Duration of Successful FAs
Figure 11 shows the duration of successful FAs for the same links. No link was successfully accused for more than a total of 114 seconds. Furthermore, only 13% of these links were successfully accused for more than 30 seconds, and only 4% for more than 40 seconds.

#### Relationship Between FA Suppression and Node Degree
Figure 9 depicts the relationship between FA suppression effectiveness and node degree, using averages for each of the four densities. The figure shows that effectiveness was only loosely correlated with average node degree. Not surprisingly, both the average node degree (4.89) and effectiveness (62.67%) were lowest during the 33-node runs. However, despite having the highest average node degree, the 48-node runs exhibited lower effectiveness (72.58%) than the 43-node and 38-node runs (75.85% and 73.50%, respectively). Possible causes for this result are discussed in Section 7. Similarly, as shown in Figure 8, the effectiveness of the best 48-node run (48A) was lower than that of the best 43 (43A) and 38 (38C) node runs.
