nodes  from  the  48-node  configuration.    The  38-node 
configuration  was  created  by  discarding  5  random 
nodes from the 43-node configuration, and so on.  At 
each density, three runs were conducted using different 
random  seeds  (A,  B,  or  C)  to  determine  the  initial 
headings  of  nodes. 
  All  runs  used  the  attacker 
positioning and mobility scenario described in Section 
5.3.  However, unlike the wormhole detection test, the 
false  accusation 
tests  utilized  continuous  node 
mobility. 
We  introduce  the  following  terminology  to  explain 
the false accusation test results.  A corroborated false 
accusation  or  “FA”  is  a  false  accusation  against  a 
victim 
link  comprising  anomalous  measurements 
reported by at least two independent pairs of observers.  
A  false  accusation  reported  by  a  single  pair  of 
observers,  but  not  corroborated  by  other  independent 
pairs,  is  of  little  interest  here  because  the  prototype 
detector  has  been  designed  to  ignore  uncorroborated 
accusations. 
We  further  distinguish  between 
two  kinds  of 
(corroborated) FAs.  A successful FA is an FA that is 
not outvoted by an equal or greater number of normal 
measurement reports from independent pairs of honest 
nodes, i.e., the attackers prevail. A suppressed FA is an 
FA that is outvoted by an equal or greater number of 
normal measurement reports from independent pairs of 
honest nodes, i.e., the honest nodes prevail.

Table  1  provides  a  summary  of  the  twelve  false 
accusation test runs. The average node degree (number 
of  one-hop  neighbors  per  node)  ranged  from  4.75  to 
7.42.  The number of seconds during which links were 
subjected  to  corroborated  false  accusations  ranged 
from 583 to 2,202 link-seconds.  The number of links 
that  were  subjected  to  corroborated  false  accusations 
ranged  from  23  to  69. As  discussed  below,  these  last 
two statistics indicate that the amount of “interesting” 
FA  data  generated  during  these  runs  varied  and  was 
strongly  correlated  with  density.    In  total,  these  runs 
generated  13,481  link-seconds  of  FAs  against  473 
victim links, a significant volume of interesting data. 
Figure  8  shows 
the  overall  effectiveness  of 
opportunistic  voting  in  instantaneously  suppressing 
FAs  across  the  test  runs.    We  define  effectiveness  as 
the  percentage  of  link-seconds  during  which  the  FAs 
were suppressed, i.e., were outvoted by pairs of honest 
observers.  Suppression  rates  ranged  from  57%  (run 
33B) to 81% (run 43A).  The overall weighted average 
across  all  runs  was  72%,  with  weights  reflecting  the 
amount of FA data generated during each run.

Figure 10.  Successful FAs - lifetime percentage 
lifetime  analysis  of 
As shown in Table 1 above, across all test runs, 473 
links were subjected to FAs.  Of these, 234 links were 
subjected to successful FAs. (For the other 239, all FAs 
were  suppressed  by  honest  outvoting.)    Figure  10 
depicts  a  per-link 
the  234 
successfully accused links.  It shows that no link was 
successfully accused for more than 14% of its lifetime.  
Conversely  for  at  least  86%  of  the  lifetime  of  every 
link, the link was either not subjected to corroborating

Figure 11.  Successful FAs – duration 
Figure 11 is a similar graph but shows the duration 
of  successful FAs for  these same  links.   No  link  was 
successfully  accused  for  more  than  a  total  of  114 
seconds.    Furthermore,  only  13%  of  these  links  were 
successfully  accused  for  more  than  30  seconds,  and 
only 4% for more than 40 seconds.

Figure 8.  Successful vs. Suppressed False 
Accusations 
Figure  9  depicts  the  relationship  between  FA 
suppression  effectiveness  and  node  degree,  using 
averages for each of the four densities.  Figure 9 shows 
that  effectiveness  was  only  loosely  correlated  with 
average  node  degree.    Not  surprisingly,  both  average 
node  degree  (4.89)  and  effectiveness  (62.67%)  were 
lowest  during  the  33-node  runs.    However,  despite 
having  the  highest  average  node  degree,  the  48-node 
runs  exhibited  effectiveness  (72.58%)  lower  than  the 
43-node and 38-node runs (75.85% and 73.50%).  We 
discuss  possible  causes  for  this  result  in  Section  7. 
Similarly,  as  shown  in  Figure  8,  the  effectiveness  of 
the best 48-node run (48A), was lower than that of the 
best 43 (43A) and 38 (38C) node runs.
