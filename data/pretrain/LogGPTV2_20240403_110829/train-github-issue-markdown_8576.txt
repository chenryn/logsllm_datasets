Hello. I would like to suggest/request the addition of a way to create
projects using Deno CLI, like we do when using cargo for Rust. For example:
    deno new --bin project-name 
    deno new --lib project-name
As we all know, like this, all projects will be organized with a well known
structure. Perhaps we can use the config file to help us too, allowing to call
external libs. And yes, I know about how deno uses url's to import stuff.  
Anyways, Thanks !
