Subject: Suggestion for Adding Project Creation via Deno CLI

Hello,

I would like to suggest the addition of a feature in the Deno Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows for the creation of new projects, similar to the functionality provided by `cargo` for Rust. This would streamline the process of setting up a new project with a standardized structure.

For instance, it would be helpful to have commands such as:
```sh
deno new --bin project-name
deno new --lib project-name
```

These commands would generate a new project with a well-organized and familiar structure, making it easier for developers to get started quickly. Additionally, it would be beneficial if the configuration file could support the inclusion of external libraries, further enhancing the development experience.

I understand that Deno currently uses URLs for importing dependencies, but having a more structured project setup would complement this approach and provide a more cohesive development environment.

Thank you for considering this suggestion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
