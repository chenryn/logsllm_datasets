This is related to #2461. Essentially if we wrap a render call in a try catch
this works the first time. It seems like when `React.render` is called a
second time (the update case) it does not work. It seems that `React.render`
is async when updating an existing component tree.
I may be missing something but it seems like this leaves no way for developers
to catch errors when rendering children components.
I have a JSBin demoing this issue here:
