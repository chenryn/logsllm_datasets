# Steps to reproduce
Open multiple tabs
# Expected behavior
As the number of tabs increase, I would expect the tab bar to behave like tabs
from a web browser: the size of the tab would shrink in order to make space
for the newly created tab.
If the above doesn't happen, I would expect a setting that would limit how
much text is displayed in a particular tab, so that one long tab doesn't take
the entire tab bar real-estate.
# Actual behavior
Tabs do not shrink nor is the text in one tab limited, causing one tab with a
lot of text to take up the entire tab bar real estate.  
The new tabTitle setting does not fix this issue, since long tab bars are
created by the shell writing to them (such as a Razzle build environment).
