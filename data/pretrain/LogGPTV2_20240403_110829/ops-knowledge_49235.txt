User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Configure CRON to use a particular MTA I have one server on which cron jobs are ran. I don't want to install sendmail or postfix on this server but still want to get mails from cron. 
I have installed Heirloom mailx (http://heirloom.sourceforge.net) and configured it to use the smtp of on an other server I have, with postfix installed and configured to relay my mails.
It works well if I use mail from the command line.

Unfortunately this does not seem enough for cron, in my syslog I can see:


  CRON[30869]: (CRON) info (No MTA installed, discarding output)


How can I "tell" cron to use this set up to send mails ?

If it matters, I am on Ubuntu 12.4

Assistant: cron relies on local sendmail mechanism to send mails.

Use lightweight smtp server: nullmailer, ssmtp as a local sendmail replacement.
