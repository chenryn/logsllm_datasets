Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the Grok analysis formula for the provided log:

### Log Example:
```
19382:C 23 Mar 16:20:54.107 * RDB: 0 MB of memory used by copy-on-write
```

### Grok Pattern:
```grok
%{NUMBER:pid}:%{WORD:role_char}\s%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}\s\*\s%{GREEDYDATA:message}
```

### Explanation:
- **`%{NUMBER:pid}`**: Captures the process ID (e.g., `19382`).
- **`%{WORD:role_char}`**: Captures the role or type character (e.g., `C`).
- **`%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp}`**: Captures the timestamp in ISO8601 format (e.g., `23 Mar 16:20:54.107`).
- **`\s\*\s`**: Matches the space, asterisk, and another space.
- **`%{GREEDYDATA:message}`**: Captures the rest of the log message (e.g., `RDB: 0 MB of memory used by copy-on-write`).

This pattern will help you extract the relevant fields from the log entry in a clear and structured manner.
