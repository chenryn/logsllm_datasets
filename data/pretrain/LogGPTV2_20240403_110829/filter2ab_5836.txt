**ATT&CK ID:** T1021.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote Desktop Protocol

**Description:**
Adversaries may exploit valid user credentials to log into a target system via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Once authenticated, the adversary can perform actions and execute commands on the remote machine as if they were the legitimate user.

**Key Points:**
- **Credential Use:** Valid account credentials are required for this technique.
- **Remote Access:** RDP provides a graphical interface for remote control of the target system.
- **Post-Exploitation Actions:** After gaining access, the adversary can carry out various malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further system exploitation.

This method is often used in targeted attacks where the adversary has already obtained valid credentials through other means, such as phishing, credential dumping, or social engineering.
