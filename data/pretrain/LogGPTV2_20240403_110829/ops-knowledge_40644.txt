User: I know Ruby right now, however I want to learn a new language. I am running Ubuntu 10.04 right now but I am going to get a Mac later this summer. Anyways I want something more for GUI development. I was wondering if I should learn C on Ubuntu right now, and then learn Objective-C when I get an iMac? Will learning C give me an edge? Or should I just learn Python on Ubuntu and then learn Objective-C when I get a new computer?
Assistant: Learning C will definitely be of help, as Objective C inherits its many properties and adds to it.
You could learn Objective C either from 'Learn Objective C on the Mac', this one's really a great book, and then if you plan to learn cocoa, get 'Learn Cocoa on the Mac' or the one by James Davidson, they should give you a fine head start, you can then consider moving to the one by Hillegass, and for a stunner 'Objective C developer handbook' by David Chisnall, this is a keeper, you can read it in a month or two.
For the compiler I would point you to clang  though a gcc and gnustep combination will work. clang is a better choice if you want to work on Obj C 2.0 features and it is under heavy development.
