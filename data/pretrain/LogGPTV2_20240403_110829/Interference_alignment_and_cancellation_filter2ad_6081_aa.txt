ABSTRACT
The throughput of existing MIMO LANs is limited by the number of
antennas on the AP. This paper shows how to overcome this limita-
tion. It presents interference alignment and cancellation (IAC), a new
approach for decoding concurrent sender-receiver pairs in MIMO
networks. IAC synthesizes two signal processing techniques, inter-
ference alignment and interference cancellation, showing that the
combination applies to scenarios where neither interference align-
ment nor cancellation applies alone. We show analytically that IAC
almost doubles the throughput of MIMO LANs. We also implement
IAC in GNU-Radio, and experimentally demonstrate that for 2x2
MIMO LANs, IAC increases the average throughput by 1.5x on the
downlink and 2x on the uplink.

1 Introduction
Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology is emerging as the nat-
ural choice for future wireless LANs. The current design, however,
merely replaces a single-antenna channel between a sender-receiver
pair with a MIMO channel. The throughput of such a design is always
limited by the number of antennas per access point (AP) [5, 29]. Intu-
itively, if each node has two antennas, the client can simultaneously
transmit two packets to the AP. The AP receives a linear combination
of the two transmitted packets, on each antenna, as shown in Fig. 1.
Hence, the AP obtains two linear equations for two unknown packets,
allowing it to decode. Transmitting more concurrent packets than
the number of antennas on the AP simply increases interference and
prevents decoding. Thus, today the throughput of all practical MIMO
LANs is limited by the number of antennas per AP.
This paper introduces Interference Alignment and Cancellation
(IAC), a practical scheme to overcome the antennas-per-AP through-
put limit in MIMO LANs. IAC synthesizes two interference manage-
ment techniques: interference alignment and interference cancella-
tion, showing that the combination improves performance in scenarios
where neither interference alignment nor cancellation applies alone.
To get a feel for how IAC works, consider again a 2-antenna client
that uploads two concurrent packets to a 2-antenna AP. Say we have

Figure 1: Throughput of current MIMO LANs is limited by the number
of antennas per AP. The hi j’s are known channel coefﬁcients, and the
pi’s are concurrent packets. The client transmits two concurrent packets.
The AP receives a different linear combination of the transmitted packets
on each antenna, which it solves to obtain the packets.

Figure 2: IAC Example. AP1 decodes packet p1 and sends the decoded
packet on the Ethernet to AP2 which then performs interference cancel-
lation to subtract p1. As a result AP2 can decode p2 and p3.
a second 2x2 client-AP pair on the same wireless channel and within
interference range. Can the second client-AP pair concurrently upload
a third packet? In existing MIMO LANs, the three concurrent packets
interfere. As a result, each of the two APs gets two linear equations
with three unknown packets, and hence cannot decode.
In contrast, IAC allows these three concurrent packets to be de-
coded. To do so, IAC exploits two properties of MIMO LANs: 1)
MIMO transmitters can control the alignment of their signals at a
receiver, and 2) APs are typically connected to a backend Ethernet,
which they can use for coordination. Thus, in IAC, the two clients
encode their transmissions in a special way to align the second and
the third packets at AP1 but not at AP2, as shown in Fig. 2. As a
result, AP1 can treat the second and third packets as one unknown;
i.e., AP1 has the equivalent of two equations with two unknowns,
allowing it to decode the ﬁrst packet, p1. AP1 then sends the decoded
packet on the Ethernet to AP2, which can now perform interference
cancellation to subtract the effect of the known packet. As a result,
AP2 is left with two linear equations over two unknown packets, p2
and p3, which it can decode. The system delivers three packets per
time unit. Hence, its throughput is not bounded by the number of
antennas per AP.
Note the synergy between interference alignment and interference
cancellation. Interference alignment aligns a subset of the packets at
the ﬁrst AP, allowing it to locally decode one packet and hence boot-
strap the decoding process. Interference cancellation enables other
APs to use the decoded packet to cancel its interference, and hence
decode more packets. Neither interference alignment nor cancellation
would be sufﬁcient on its own to decode the three packets in Fig. 2.
159IAC has the following features:
• IAC brings in more gains than apparent in the above example and
generalizes to any number of antennas. For a MIMO system with
M antennas, we prove analytically that IAC delivers 2M concurrent
packets on the uplink, and max(2M − 2, ⌊ 3
2 M⌋) on the downlink –
i.e., it doubles the throughput of the uplink, and almost doubles the
throughput of the downlink for a large number of antennas.
• IAC delegates all coordination to the APs, which tell the clients how
to encode their packets to produce the desirable alignment. Further,
the channel estimates required for computing this alignment can
be computed from ack packets with negligible overhead.
• IAC works with various modulations and FEC codes. This is be-
cause IAC subtracts interference before passing a signal to the
rest of the PHY, which can use a standard 802.11 MIMO modula-
tor/demodulator and FEC codes.
We have built a prototype of IAC in GNU-Radio and evaluated it
using a testbed of 20 USRP nodes, each equipped with 2-antennas.
Our results reveal the following ﬁndings:
• IAC improves the average throughput of our 20-node 2-antenna
MIMO LAN by 1.52x on the downlink and 2.08x on the uplink.
These experimental gains are slightly higher than the analytical
ones because our analysis does not model IAC’s diversity gains.
• IAC is fair in the sense that every client in our testbed beneﬁts from
using IAC instead of current MIMO.
• IAC provides a gain for any number of clients including a single
active client. In this case, IAC exploits diversity to improve the
throughput by 1.2x.
1.1 Contributions
This paper makes three main contributions:
• It presents interference alignment and cancellation (IAC), a new
interference management technique that synthesizes interference
alignment and interference cancellation, showing that the combina-
tion increases the throughput in scenarios where neither alignment
nor cancellation applies separately.
• It analytically demonstrates that IAC almost doubles the multiplex-
ing gain (i.e., number of concurrent transmissions) of ﬂat-fading
interference-limited MIMO LANs. The capacity of a distributed
network can be written as [6]:
C(SNR) = dlog(SNR) + o(log(SNR)),
where d is the multiplexing gain and the capacity is computed as a
function of the signal to noise ratio (SNR). At relatively high SNRs,
the capacity is dominated by the ﬁrst term and linearly increases
with the multiplexing gain, d. We prove that IAC increases the
multiplexing gain of ﬂat-fading MIMO LANs, and thus provides a
linear increase in the capacity characterization of these networks.
• It presents the ﬁrst implementation of interference alignment
demonstrating its feasibility. Our results show that in ﬂat-fading
channels, alignment can be performed without any synchroniza-
tion even in the presence of different frequency offsets between
concurrent transmitters.
2 Related Work
Related work falls in the following areas.
(a) MIMO Communication Theory. Our work builds on the theory
of interference alignment. Recent work has argued that pre-processing
signals at the senders in a manner that aligns interference at the
receivers increases the total capacity of wireless networks [3, 6, 9, 21].
However, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to present
a system design and an implementation of interference alignment,
showing that such idea works in practice. Further, this paper is the
ﬁrst to combine interference alignment with interference cancellation,
showing that the combination, termed IAC, increases the throughput
in scenarios where neither alignment nor cancellation helps alone.
Our work builds on recent advances in the theory of multiuser
MIMO (MU-MIMO). MU-MIMO advocates having multiple clients
concurrently communicate with a single AP or base station [11, 13,
29, 30]. Thus, the throughput of MU-MIMO is limited by the number
of antennas on a single AP [13]. In contrast, this paper shows that
IAC overcomes the antennas-per-AP throughput limit.
Our work is also related to Virtual MIMO [29, 20]. Virtual MIMO
allows multiple transmitters to transmit concurrently and makes the
receivers collaborate to jointly decode the concurrent transmissions.
Virtual MIMO, however, remains a theoretical concept with no practi-
cal design because of two difﬁculties. First, it requires the transmitters
to be synchronized to the symbol level. Second, it requires the re-
ceivers to communicate the raw received signal samples to be jointly
decode. Communicating signal samples generates excessive overhead
because to capture a signal without loss of information one needs to
sample it at twice its bandwidth at each antenna, with each sample
about 8-bit long. For example, to jointly decode three APs with four
antennas each, one needs to send 6 Gb/s on the Ethernet. In con-
trast, IAC’s receivers communicate decoded packets, and hence the
Ethernet trafﬁc remains comparable to the wireless throughput.
(b) Wireless Networks. Past work on single-antenna systems has
proposed using multiple APs to improve coverage [26, 8], balance
the load [22], or recover corrupted packets [24, 31]. This paper use
multiple APs but focuses on MIMO networks, and introduces IAC, a
new technique that enables MIMO LANs to support a larger number
of concurrent transmissions than possible with existing designs.
Prior work has also advocated allowing concurrent transmissions in
the context of single-antenna nodes. Some of these designs prevent in-
terference by dividing the resources between users. For example, they
might assign the different users different frequency bands [25, 26], or
different codes [7, 17]. Other designs use interference cancellation
to decode in the presence of interfering signals [14, 18]. IAC differs
from this work in focus because it addresses MIMO networks. It also
differs in mechanisms because IAC does not assign users different
frequency bands or different codes and applies to scenarios where
interference cancellation alone does not apply.
Finally, APs with directional antennas divide the space into sectors,
each served by a different antenna. This prevents interference between
nodes in different sectors, allowing multiple clients to communicate
concurrently with the AP. Our approach is orthogonal to directional
antennas since we can enable nodes in the same sector (i.e., nodes
that interfere) to communicate at the same time.1

Interference Alignment and Cancellation
IAC’s design targets MIMO wireless LANs in a university or corpo-
rate campus where APs are connected via a wired infrastructure (e.g.,
Ethernet). Today these networks use one AP to serve any particular
area, and limit interference by assigning adjacent APs to different
1It is a common mistake to think that MIMO beam-forming is equivalent to directional
antennas. Beam-forming allows the signal to constructively combine at the intended
receiver, increasing its throughput. This however still creates interference at nodes that
are not in the direction of the intended receiver. Hence, beam-forming cannot overcome
the antennas-per-node throughput limit of MIMO LANs.

Figure 3: Two Packets on Uplink. The client transmits two packets,
p1 and p2, from its two antennas. The packets arrive along the vectors
H[1 0]T and H[0 1]T , where H is the channel matrix and [.]T refers to
the transpose of a vector. To decode p1 and p2, the AP projects along the
vectors orthogonal to H[0 1]T and H[1 0]T respectively.
802.11 channels. Similar to the current architecture, in IAC, adjacent
areas employ different 802.11 channels, but in contrast to the current
architecture, each of these areas is served by a set of APs on the same
channel, rather than a single AP. IAC allows this set of APs to serve
multiple clients at the same time despite interference. To do so, it
leverages the wired bandwidth to enable the APs to collaborate on
resolving interfering transmissions.
IAC has three components: 1) a physical layer that decodes con-
current packets across APs, 2) a MAC protocol that coordinates the
senders to transmit concurrently on the wireless medium, and 3) an
efﬁcient mechanism to estimate channel parameters.
4 IAC’s Physical Layer
IAC modiﬁes the physical layer to allow multiple client-AP pairs to
communicate concurrently on an 802.11 channel. IAC operates below
existing modulation and coding and is transparent to both.
For clarity, we present our ideas in the context of a 2-antenna per-
node system, and assume nodes know the channel estimates. Later,
