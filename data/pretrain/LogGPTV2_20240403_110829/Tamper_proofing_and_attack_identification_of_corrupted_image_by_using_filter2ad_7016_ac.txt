3 by the or-
logical  operation  in  Eq.(3).  To  measure  the  similarity  between 
original  and  extracted  watermarks,  we  define  five  similarities, 
v1=SIM1,1, v2=SIM1,2, v3=SIM2,2, v4=SIM3,2, v5=SIM3,3, which are 
formulated in Eq.(4). The values v1, v3, and v5 typically represent 
the  similarity  between  original  and  extracted  watermarks.  The 
purpose  of  v2  and  v4  is  to  measure  the  characteristic  of  attack, 
which is either global tampering or regional tampering. 
3.4  Attack Identification for Tri-watermarking 
Algorithm 
Five similarities of tri-watermarking algorithm are applied to the 
attack  classification  and  identification.  A  decision  tree  of  attack 
identification is shown in Figure 5. The reason for adopting these 
attacks  is  that  they  are  easily  and  frequently  applied  to  image 
processing  throughout  the  existing  commercial  software,  e.g. 
Adobe Photoshop, PhotoImpact, Paint Shop Pro, etc. In our study, 
the  image  is  corrupted  by  25  different  attacks  for  11  classes, 
including: (1) JPEG (JP) with QF=100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 
50%, 40%; (2) JPEG 2000 (JK) with 2 bit/pixel compression ratio; 
(3) Gaussian noise (GN) with zero mean and variance (cid:86)2=80; (4) 
3(cid:117)3  median  filtering  (MD);  (5)  3(cid:117)3  lowpass  filtering  (LP);  (6) 
3(cid:117)3 Gaussian blurring (GB); (7) image rotation (RT) with 1(cid:113), 5(cid:113),
10(cid:113) and 20(cid:113); (8) image scaling (SC) with 50%, 75%, 150% and 
200% of image size; (9) frequency mode Laplacian removal [26] 
(FM)  with  (cid:74)=0.03  and  (cid:68)=0.05,  0.5  and  2;  (10)  salt  and  pepper 
noise  addition  (SP)  with  density  of  5%;  and  (11)  region

global attack and initial a(i, j)=(cid:69) for regional attack. The variable 
(cid:68) is 0 or –1, and (cid:69) is 1 in our algorithm. The problem of Eq.(7) is 
solved  by  using  the  pseudoinverse  operation,  which  is  based  on 
minimum  squared-error  (MSE)  method  [28].  The  solution  (cid:58)(cid:99)  is 
formulated as, 
AV†(cid:32)(cid:99)(cid:58)
,                                           (8)

where  Vt  denotes  the  transpose  of  matrix  V.  Recalculate  the 
a(i,j)‘s by substituting (cid:58)(cid:99) in Eq.(7), we estimate a threshold (cid:87) to 
classify the attacks into two groups. 
To  find  an  appropriate  threshold  is  considered  as  two-
category classification program. For example, three attacks (NW, 
SP and JP/JK) will be classified into two categories: one is NW, 
and  the  other  is  the  group  of  SP  and  JP/JK  attacks.  In  the  left 
diagram of Figure 6a, it illustrates the attack state values of three 
attacks.  Assume  that  each  category  is  Gaussian  distribution,  we 
calculate  the  means  (cid:80)  and  variances  (cid:86)  2  of  attacks,  and  the 
distributions are illustrated in right diagram of Figure 6a. In order 
to  simply  the  classifying  procedure,  we  find  two  nearest 
distributions by distance function. The distance function between 
si and sj is defined as, 
(cid:32)
(cid:12)j

function 
(CDF)  of 
where (cid:80)i<(cid:80)j. Hence, we find that two nearest distributions are s1
(NW)  and  s2  (SP)  in  Figure  6a.  Eq.(10)  is  a  simple  L1-norm 
function. The reason of choosing the position of 2(cid:86) from (cid:80) is the 
cumulative  distribution 
the  Gaussian 
distribution at 2(cid:86) is 0.99. It implies the position could represent 
the  corresponding  distribution.  Therefore,  Eq.(10)  is  not  only  to 
calculate  the  distance  between  two  positions,  but  it  is  also  to 
measure the distance between two distributions. The discriminant 
function g(x) [28] is used for finding the proper separating point 
for two distributions, and is formulated as

where  x  is  the  state  value,  p(si)  and  p(x|si)  represent  the 
probability  and  conditional  probability  of  distribution  si.  The 
diagram  of  absolute  discriminant  function  |g(x)|  is  shown  in 
Figure  6b.  Consequently,  the  threshold  is  the  state  value 
corresponds to the minimum |g(x)|, and (cid:87) is 0.719. At each node 
of decision tree, we implement the above-mentioned classification 
method to estimate the weighting values and thresholds.
image  embeds  watermark.  Therefore, 
The  decision  tree  is  valid.  There  are  four  reasons:  firstly, 
when  we  receive  a  suspected  image,  the  primary  question  is 
whether 
the 
discrimination  between  non-watermarked  and  watermarked 
images proceeds in the first stage. Secondary, the similar question 
for  watermarked  image  is  whether  the  image  encounters  the 
attacks.  Due  to  the  similarities  for  non-attacked  image  are 
constant  (e.g.,  v1=1, v2=0.865, v3=1, v4=0.935  and  v5=1),  the 
discrimination  between  non-attacked  and  attacked 
images 
proceeds  in  second  stage.  Thirdly,  in  order  to  increase  the 
accuracy of attack identification, it classifies the attacks into the 
global and the regional attacks. Fourthly, the discrimination in the 
global/regional  attack  is  based  on  the  characteristic  between  the 
attacks. For instance, lowpass filtering, median filtering, Gaussian 
blurring and Laplacian removal are performed with a 3(cid:117)3 mask, 
and the functionality of four attacks is the noise-cleaning process. 
The  characteristic  of  these  attacks  are  different  to  JPEG/JPEG 
2000  compression  and  Gaussian  noise,  therefore,  they  are 
immediately classified at node D after the global/regional attack 
classification. 
4.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
In this section, we will show the experimental results, including: 
multiple-watermark  extraction, 
tamper  proofing  and  attack 
classification/identification.  We  first  use  540  corrupted  images 
(20  training  images  encountered  under  non-watermarked,  non-
attacked  and  25  attacks  to  result  in  540  corrupted  images)  for 
training the parameters. For 1st experiment in the test procedure, 
we use 810 corrupted images (30 tested images encountered under 
non-watermarked,  non-attacked  and  25  attacks  to  result  in  810 
corrupted  images).  Additionally,  there  are  totally  1620  images 
(previous  810  corrupted  image  in  1st  experiment  and  additional 
extra 810 corrupted images) are employed for 2nd experiment in 
the  test  procedure.  The  parameters  of    all  attacks  have  been 
described in Section 3.4.

4.1  Multiple-watermark Extraction 
Dividing  the  watermarked  image  into  128(cid:117)128  blocks  with  size 
4(cid:117)4, which embed one bi-watermark bit in one block. Meanwhile, 
two  128(cid:117)128  meaningful  binary  images  are  considered  as 
watermarks, one is full of R-marks named 1st watermark and the 
other  one  is  full  of  G-marks  named  2nd  watermark.  The 
parameters Q1, Q2, and (cid:72) are set to 70, 1, 1.5, respectively. The bi-
watermarked 
is  PSNR=40.39dB.  The  extracted  bi-
watermarks  of  12  corrupted  mages  are  shown  in  Figure  7.  In 
clearly  indicates  that  our  method  achieves  the  better  attack 
tolerances in JP, JK, GN, RT, FM, SP and RM, and preserves the 
2nd watermark after attacking. It shows the proposed semi-fragile

4.2  Tamper Proofing 
The  experiment  result  of  tamper  proofing  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
and  Figure  8a  illustrates  the  watermarked  image.  The  image  Ikl
marks the unequal watermark bits between W*
k and Wl, and then 
Ikl  permutes  to  a  tampered-mark  image  I(cid:99)kl  by  secret  key.  The

images  (I(cid:99)11  and  I(cid:99)22)  for  single  RM  attack,  which  modifies  the 
center region of watermarked image, are displayed in the Figure 
8b.  Moreover,  we  implement  multiple  attacks,  including:  JPEG 
compression  (QF=80%),  two  region  modifications  (at  the  center 
and  the  upper-left  corner  of  the  image).  The  bi-watermark  and 
two tampered-mask images are shown in Figire 8c. I(cid:99)11 illustrates 
the mixture-tampered areas, however, I(cid:99)22 illustrates distinctly the 
tampered areas of regional attacks at the upper-left corner and the 
center of the image.

In  addition,  we  apply  thirty  512(cid:117)512  gray-scale  images  to 
implement the multiple attacks. First, tested images encounter 10 
region  modification  attacks  with  different  sizes  (range  0.5%  to 
2%  of  the  image  size),  these  attacks  appear  in  the  random 
positions of the watermarked images. The accuracy of tampered

tamper proofing is successful implemented in RM with JK, GN,

RM with GB, LP, MD, SC or JP (QF<40%) attacks.

4.3  Attack Classification/Identification 
For tri-watermarking scheme, we employ 540 corrupted images of 
size 512(cid:117)512 to train the parameters, including: (cid:87), (cid:90)1, (cid:90)2, (cid:90)3, (cid:90)4,
(cid:90)5  and  (cid:90)6  at  each  node  of  decision  tree,  and  the  appropriate 
parameters  are  listed  in  Table  3.  Subsequently,  810  images  are 
tested for the 1st experiment of the attack identification, and the 
accuracies of 9 categories are listed in Table 4. In addition, there 
are  1620  images  are  tested  for  the  2st  experiment  of  the  attack 
identification,  and  the  accuracies  are  listed  in  Table  4  as  well. 
Besides JP/JK, MD, GB/LP and RT/SC/FM, the accuracies of the 
others are 1. 
the  attack  characterization 
In  Table  5,  it  lists  the  function’s  comparisons  among  the 
existing  9  watermarking  schemes  and  our  method.  To  compare 
the  results,  there  are  several  schemes  can  embed  multiple 
watermarks.  Moreover,  most  schemes  can  achieve  the  tampered 
proofing  and  need  secrete  key  to  improve  the  watermarking 
security.  For  the  attack  analysis,  Kundur’s  [17]  and  our  method

respectively. Our method is superior to the others in the function 
of attack identification, and it can classify/identify the attacks to 9 
attack categories, which are never provided in the other methods. 
For  subjective  tests,  we  employ  a  group  of  members,  include 
specialists,  artist,  non-specialists,  to  evaluate  the  difference 
between original and watermarked images. Therefore, the results 
are satisfactory with subjective tests for transparent evaluation.

5.  CONCLUSION 
In 
this  paper,  we  present  a  novel  semi-fragile  multiple-
watermarking  algorithm.  It’s  based  on  the  quantization-base 
watermarking,  and  can  embed  two  and  three  watermarks  by  bi-
watermarking  and  tri-watermarking  algorithms  respectively.  The 
experimental results show that the proposed method successfully 
locates the single and multiple tampered areas for tamper proofing. 
Moreover, the attack classification uses mean square-error method 
to classify the attacks into 9 categories. The experimental results 
also show that the bi-watermarking technique robust against JPEG 
and  JPEG  2000  compression,  Gaussian  noise,  image  rotation, 
frequency  mode  Laplacian  removal,  salt  and  pepper  noise,  and 
region  modification,  but  is  weak  against  median  filtering, 
Gaussian blurring, lowpass filtering, and image scaling.
