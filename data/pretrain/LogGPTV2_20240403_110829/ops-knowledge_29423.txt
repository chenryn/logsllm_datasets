User: List common technical means for server security hardening, such as SSH security, firewall, etc.
Assistant: 1. SSH security: Use the SSH protocol to replace the insecure Telnet protocol, use the SSH key instead of the password to log in, use the SSH connection to protect the web management interface, etc. 2. Firewall: Set up a network firewall to filter and audit programs and data streams, restrict access to server IP addresses and ports, and add trusted host IP addresses to the whitelist to prevent attacks. 3. System update: Regularly upgrade the operating system, install patches and security updates, fix security holes in time, and reduce the risk of being attacked. 4. Access control: Control users through identity verification and rights management, specify the complexity of user passwords, set password expiration policies, and record user access logs. 5. Monitoring and auditing: Use security monitoring tools to monitor the security status of the server in real time, and give timely warnings when abnormal situations are found. At the same time, it records the operation behavior and event logs of all users, which is convenient for tracking problems and discovering attack behaviors. 6. Data encryption: use encryption technology to protect the security of data transmission and storage, ensure the confidentiality of data externally, and use SSL certificates to encrypt web servers to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. 7. Security enhancement: Disable useless services and ports, restrict access to files and directories, use application security tools to check code vulnerabilities, and avoid attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. 8. Backup and recovery: Regularly back up server data and configuration files to avoid data loss or accidental data modification after being attacked. At the same time, backup data needs to be encrypted to avoid being attacked or blackmailed due to data leakage.
