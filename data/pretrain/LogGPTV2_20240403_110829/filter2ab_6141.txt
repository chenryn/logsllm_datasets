### Title: BotConf 2020 - Tracking Unsafe Services Hosted by Bots Using IP Reputation

In this presentation, we introduce a system designed to identify and track unsafe services hosted on bots. The system operates by identifying services whose hosting IP addresses have been flagged as bot-related by an IP reputation threat intelligence system due to their involvement in cyber attacks, such as DDoS, SQL injections, and account takeover campaigns. Additionally, the system ensures that the hosting IP is not shared with other legitimate web services.

The system leverages Akamaiâ€™s IP reputation system, which interacts with over 1.3 billion devices daily. This system identifies bots that launch cyber attacks against websites hosted on the Akamai CDN platform, which serves up to 30% of the world's web content. We focus specifically on machines involved in DDoS attacks, SQL injections, and account takeover campaigns.

Once the IP addresses of these bots are identified, we scan over 2.2 billion daily DNS queries processed through the Akamai platform. This process helps us identify domains that uniquely resolve to the bots' IP addresses, marking these domains as unsafe for use. The system generates a list of thousands of unsafe domains on a weekly basis, which are continuously monitored for analysis and active protection.
