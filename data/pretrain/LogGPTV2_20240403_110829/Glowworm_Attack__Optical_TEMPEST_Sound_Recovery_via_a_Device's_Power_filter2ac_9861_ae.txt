## Experimental Setup

**Figure 12: Experimental Setup**
- **Eavesdropping Equipment**: Placed outside an office (red rectangle).
- **Speakers**: Positioned at various locations (blue stars) at distances of 15, 25, and 35 meters from the eavesdropping equipment.
- **Separation**: Two closed glass doors (yellow bars) between the eavesdropping equipment and the speakers.

| Distance (m) | Intelligibility | LLR | NIST SNR |
|--------------|----------------|-----|----------|
| 15           | 0.607          | 1.704 | 3.24     |
| 25           | 0.552          | 3.359 | 17.3     |
| 35           | 0.476          | 9.3   | 14       |

## Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Analysis

**Figure 13: SNR for various distances at a sound level of 70 dB.**

**Results:**
- The SNR is stable across the measured spectrum but decreases with distance due to light deterioration.
- The SNR values are as follows:
  - 15 meters: 17.3
  - 25 meters: 14
  - 35 meters: 9.3

## Performance Evaluation

**Experimental Setup:**
- **Distances**: 15, 25, and 35 meters from the Winner speakers' power indicator LED.
- **Sound Level**: 70 dB.
- **Electro-Optical Sensor**: Configured for the highest gain level before saturation.

**Results:**
- Speech was recovered using Optical Acoustic Transduction (OAT).
- Recovered audio signals are available online.
- **Intelligibility**:
  - 15 meters: Good
  - 35 meters: Fair

**Conclusions:**
- Glowworm allows eavesdroppers to recover sound from up to 35 meters at a lower sound level (70 dB) compared to previous methods requiring 85-94 dB [43] and +95 dB [24, 70].
- By analyzing optical measurements, eavesdroppers can double the range of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method used to recover sound using EMR analysis [23].

## Potential Improvements

### Telescope
- **Lens Diameter**: Larger lens diameters (ùúãùëü¬≤) capture more light, optimizing the SNR of the recovered audio signal.

### Electro-Optical Sensor
- **Internal Gain**: Increase sensor sensitivity by using a sensor with higher internal gain (e.g., PDA100A2 supports up to 70 dB).
- **Noise Level**: Use a sensor with a lower noise level or profile the self-noise to filter it out.

### Sound Recovery System
- **Advanced Denoising Methods**: Use advanced denoising algorithms that require large datasets for training.
- **Speech Quality Improvement**: Implement artificial bandwidth extension algorithms [37, 38, 45, 55, 56].
- **ADC Sensitivity**: Use a more sensitive Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with a lower sound level threshold.

## Countermeasures

### Manufacturer Side
- **Capacitor Integration**: Add a capacitor in parallel to the power LED indicator to act as a low-pass filter (Fig. 15b).
- **OPAMP Integration**: Use an additional OPAMP between the power line and the power indicator LED (Fig. 15c) or use an existing GPIO port of an integrated microcontroller (Fig. 15d).

### Consumer Side
- **Black Tape**: Place black tape over the device's power indicator LED to prevent optical measurements, though this may decrease user experience (UX).

## Responsible Disclosure

### Steps Taken
1. **Disclosure to Manufacturers**: Details of the attack were disclosed to Google, Logitech, Creative, TP-Link, Raspberry Pi, Winner, and MIRACASE via their bug bounty programs and contact emails.
2. **Confidentiality**: Paper details were not shared to maintain confidentiality.
3. **Manufacturer Engagement**: Encouraged manufacturers to meet to discuss countermeasures.
4. **Conference Submission**: Informed manufacturers about the conference submission and potential public release.
5. **Non-Disclosure**: Refrained from uploading the paper to arXiv, discussing findings with other researchers, and submitting to non-academic conferences.

### Responses
- **Google, TP-Link, and Creative**: Responded, requested more details, and informed us they would update us on their next steps.
- **Logitech, Raspberry Pi, Winner, and MIRACASE**: No response as of writing.

## Discussion, Limitations & Future Work

### Purpose
- Raise awareness about the feasibility of recovering sound through optical measurements from a device's power indicator LED.

### Hypotheses
- The method may already be known in military and espionage circles due to the long-standing integration of power indicator LEDs and their linear response to power consumption.
- Historical examples like the "Great Seal Bug" [21] suggest that new technologies can be exploited for eavesdropping before public discovery.

### Recommendations
- **Manufacturers**: Test devices for vulnerability and redesign electrical circuits to prevent the Glowworm attack.
- **Cost Considerations**: Financial implications may deter manufacturers from implementing countermeasures, leaving many devices vulnerable.

### Future Research
- Continue exploring optical sound eavesdropping methods, such as those using high-frequency video cameras, LiDAR, and electro-optical sensors.
- Address the broader risks associated with optical signals, including power consumption analysis and other potential attacks.
