Figure 12: Experimental setup: The eavesdropping equip-
ment, which was placed outside an office (in a location de-
noted by the red rectangle), was directed at the speakers
which were placed in various locations (denoted with blue
stars) at a distance of 15, 25, and 35 meters from the eaves-
dropping equipment. Two closed glass doors separated the
eavesdropping equipment and the speakers (denoted by yel-
low bars).

Figure 13: The SNR for various distances at a sound level of
70 dB.
Results: Fig. 13 presents the SNR for various distances. As can
be seen from the results, the SNR looks very promising and stable
through the entire spectrum measured. Unsurprisingly, the SNR
decreases as a function of the distance, since light deteriorates with
distance.
Next, we evaluated Glowworm‚Äôs performance in terms of its
ability to recover speech audio from various distances. In order
to do so, we recovered a well-known statement made by Donald
Trump: "We will make America great again!"
Experimental Setup: We placed the eavesdropping equipment at
three distances (15, 25, and 35 meters) from the Winner speakers‚Äô
power indicator LED. We played the audio file via the speakers at
70 dB. The electro-optical sensor was configured for the highest
gain level before saturation.
Results: We recovered speech by applying OAT to the optical
measurements. The recovered audio signals are available online2
where they can be heard. The spectrogram of the recovered speech
is presented in Fig. 14, and the intelligibility, LLR, and NIST-SNR of
the recovered signals are reported in Table 3.
Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the intelligibility of
the recovered signals is considered good up to a distance of 15
meters and fair up to a distance of 35 meters.
Session 6C: Audio Systems and Autonomous Driving CCS ‚Äô21, November 15‚Äì19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1910The results obtained show that Glowworm allows eavesdroppers
to recover sound from a distance of 35 meters at a lower sound level
than eavesdropping methods proposed in previous studies which
require higher sound levels of 85-94 dB [43] and +95 dB [24, 70]. In
addition, the results show that by analyzing optical measurements,
eavesdroppers can double the range of the previous SOTA method
used to recover sound from a device using EMR analysis [23].

7 Potential Improvements
In this section, we suggest methods that eavesdroppers can use to
optimize the quality of the recovered audio or increase the range
(i.e., distance between the eavesdropper and a device‚Äôs power indi-
cator LED), without changing the setup of the target location.
The potential improvements suggested below are presented
based on the component they optimize.
Telescope. The amount of light that is captured by a telescope
with a diameter of 2ùëü is determined by the area of its lens (ùúãùëü2). As
a result, using telescopes with a larger lens diameter enables the
sensor to capture more light and optimizes the SNR of the recovered
audio signal.
Electro-Optical Sensor. The sensitivity of the system can be
enhanced by increasing the sensor‚Äôs internal gain. Eavesdroppers
can use a sensor that supports higher internal gain levels (note
that the electro-optical sensor used in this study, PDA100A2 [9],
outputs voltage in the range of [-10,10] and supports a maximum
internal gain of 70 dB). Alternatively, the sensitivity of the system
can be enhanced by using an electro-optical sensor with a lower
noise level. Another option for maximizing the SNR is to profile
the electro-optical sensor‚Äôs self-noise (when the light is recorded)
in order to filter its self noise.
Sound Recovery System. While many advanced denoising
methods have been presented in the audio processing field, a large
amount of data is often required to train a model that profiles the
noise in order to optimize the output‚Äôs quality. Such algorithms/-
models can be used in place of the simple methods used in this
research. In addition, various advanced dedicated algorithms for
improving speech quality can also be used to extend the effective
band of the recovered signal (e.g., artificial bandwidth extension
algorithms [37, 38, 45, 55, 56]). In addition, more sensitive ADC
(with lower sound level) can be used to sample the electro-optical
sensor.
8 Countermeasures
In this section, we describe several countermeasure methods that
can be used to mitigate or prevent the Glowworm attack.
Manufacturer side. In most devices the power indicator LED
is connected directly to the power line (see Fig. 15a). As a result,
the device‚Äôs power indicator LED is highly affected by the power
consumption fluctuations that occur when speakers produce sound.
To counter this phenomenon, a few approaches should be consid-
ered by hardware manufacturers: (1) Using a capacitor: A capacitor
can be integrated in parallel to the power LED indicator; in this
case, the capacitor behaves as a low-pass filter (see Fig. 15b). This
is a straightforward and inexpensive solution for reducing AC fluc-
tuations. However, in devices with high power consumption, the
integrated capacitor must be large enough to supply a sufficient

amplifier (c), and the existing OPAMP (d).
amount of current to the speakers. (2) Using an OPAMP: This can
be implemented by integrating an additional OPAMP between the
power line and the power indicator LED (see Fig. 15c) or by using
an existing GPIO port of an integrated microcontroller as a power
supply for the power indicator LED (see Fig. 15d). In both cases,
this will eliminate power line AC fluctuations by a factor of the
OPAMP amplifier‚Äôs CMRR (common mode rejection ratio).
Consumer side. The attack can also be prevented by placing
black tape over a device‚Äôs power indicator LED. While this solution
decreases a device‚Äôs UX, it prevents the attackers from obtaining
optical measurements from vulnerable devices.
9 Responsible Disclosure
We performed the following steps:
(1) We disclosed the details of the attack with the manufactur-
ers of the devices that were analyzed in this research via
their bug bounty programs and contact-us email addresses:
Google, Logitech, Creative, TP-Link, Raspberry Pi, Winner,
and MIRACASE. The email sent to each of the manufactur-
ers contained explanations about the research, the Glow-
worm attack, proof that their devices are vulnerable to the
Glowworm attack (electric and optical spectrograms of chirp
functions), and recovered speech signals.
(2) We did not share the paper in order to keep the names of the
other manufacturers confidential. In addition, we decided to
refrain from informing manufacturers of devices that were
not tested in this research about the Glowworm attack. We
made this decision in order to prevent the information from
spreading before giving the affected device manufacturers
time to respond.
(3) We encouraged the manufacturers to meet with us in order
to ensure that they understood the problem and assist them
in developing a countermeasure.
(4) We explained to the manufacturers that we sent our findings
to a conference and our paper may become public around
November.
(5) We refrained from: (1) uploading the paper to arXiv, (2) dis-
cussing our findings with other researchers, and (3) sending
the research to non-academic conferences.
Google, TP-Link, and Creative responded to our disclosure, asked
us for more details, sent the findings of this research to their product
team, and informed us that they would update us regarding their
Session 6C: Audio Systems and Autonomous Driving CCS ‚Äô21, November 15‚Äì19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1911next steps. AS of this writing, Logitech, Raspberry Pi, Winner, and
MIRACASE have not responded to our disclosure.
10 Discussion, Limitations & Future Work
The purpose of this research was to raise awareness regarding the
feasibility of recovering sound by analyzing optical measurements
obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at a device‚Äôs power
indicator LED. While we are the first to demonstrate this method
in the academic realm, we wonder whether our method is already
known within the military and espionage realms. While we can
only hypothesize about the answer to this question, for the fol-
lowing reasons we believe that we are not the first to exploit a
device‚Äôs power indicator LED to recover sound: (1) power indicator
LEDs have been integrated into devices for many years, (2) power
indicator LEDs‚Äô linear response to power consumption has been
known for many years, (3) sound recovery is of interest to various
entities around the world, and (4) virtual meeting platforms have
been used for many years, given the fact that their protocols are
encrypted. In addition, the case of the "Great Seal Bug" [21] proved
that a new technology, the RFID, was used by agencies to eavesdrop
three decades before it was scientifically discovered in 1973 [44].
We recommend that other hardware manufacturers empirically
test whether their devices are vulnerable to the Glowworm attack.
We hope that our findings will encourage hardware manufactur-
ers to take our suggestions to empirically test their devices and
redesign their electrical circuits (according to the suggestions pro-
vided in Section 8), in order to prevent eavesdroppers from applying
the Glowworm attack in the future. However, we are not certain
that they will implement our suggestions due to the financial im-
plications of doing so, as some of the solutions may increase the
manufacturer‚Äôs overall cost, decreasing the revenue or requiring
the manufacturer to increase the price of the product (which could
make the device less attractive to consumers). While the cost of
our countermeasures might seem negligible, given the likelihood
that the devices are mass produced, the addition of a component
to prevent the attack could cost a manufacturer millions of dollars.
Given the cost-driven nature of consumers and the profit-driven
nature of manufacturers, known vulnerabilities are often ignored
as a means of reducing costs. This fact may leave many electrical
circuits vulnerable to Glowworm attack for years to come.
We also note that the area of optical sound eavesdropping has
progressed significantly in the past seven years: a few studies have
presented innovative methods to recover speech using data ac-
quired from a high frequency video camera [24], LiDAR [62], and
an electro-optical sensor [54]. Our attack continues the trend of
recovering sound by exploiting optical side effects, and we believe
that other studies will address this topic in the next few years.
We note that the risk posed by optical signals obtained from a de-
vice‚Äôs power indicator LED is not limited to sound recovery. Various
attacks where the attacker analyzed a device‚Äôs power consumption
have already been demonstrated. The optical signals obtained from
a device‚Äôs power indicator LED serve as a remote approximation
of the power consumed by the device due to the fact that: (1) the
intensity of LED is highly correlated with the power consumption,
and (2) LEDs are highly responsive to their input voltage. While, the

ers: Z200 (left) and Z120 (right). The results show that not all
