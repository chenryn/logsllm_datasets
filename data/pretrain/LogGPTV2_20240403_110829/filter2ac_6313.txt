To enhance security, organizations should restrict permissions for creating snapshots or backups in line with the principle of least privilege. Specifically, this involves:

- Limiting the number of users who have IAM roles with administrative privileges.
- Reducing the number of permanent privileged role assignments.
- Conducting regular entitlement reviews for IAM users, roles, and policies.

By implementing these measures, organizations can minimize the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
