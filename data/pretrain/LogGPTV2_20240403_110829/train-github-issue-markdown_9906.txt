## Summary
Hi! I'm getting some of my POST requests duplicated at my API, and I was
wondering if an axios request could have been automatically retried/sent again
in case of connection failure, reset, or any other reason.
As this is a random behavior and it's happening in production/users machines,
it is being a kinda difficult to collect any evidence. Maybe you guys have
experienced, or have acknowledge of something similar to my scenario.
All users that reported duplication in their actions also experienced a
abnormal wait time.
I have checked the action creator that calls axios.create, and it is being
dispatched just one time by an onClick event.
Thanks in advance!
