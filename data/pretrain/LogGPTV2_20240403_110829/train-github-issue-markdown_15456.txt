## Steps to Reproduce

1. Upgrade Flutter from version 0.2 to 0.3 using the command `flutter upgrade`.
2. Run `flutter doctor` in the project folder.
3. The following output was observed:

   ```

   ```

   Each time I run `flutter doctor`, I get different logs. After several attempts, one of the logs showed:

   ```

   ```

   After multiple retries, the `flutter doctor` command eventually ran successfully, and the output was as follows:

   ```
