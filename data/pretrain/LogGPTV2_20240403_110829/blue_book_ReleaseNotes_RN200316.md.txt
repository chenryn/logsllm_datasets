## 200316 (AzSK v.4.7.0)
### Feature updates
* Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
    * DevOps Kit PIM cmdlets now support PIM operations at management group scope.
    * ```Set-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` (alias ```setpim```) for configuring/changing PIM settings
```setpim -ActivateMyRole –ManagementGroupId $MGID -RoleName Reader -DurationInHours 8 -Justification 'ad hoc test'```
    Similar operations can be performed for other switches like –AssignRole, -AssignEligibleforPermanentAssignments, -RemovePermanentAssignments, -ExtendExpiringAssignments and -RemovePIMAssignment in ```setpim``` command.
    * ```Get-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` (alias ```getpim```) for querying various PIM settings/status 
```getpim -ListPIMAssignments –ManagementGroupId $MGID``` 
    Similar operations can be performed for other switches like –ListPermanentAssignments and –ListSoonToExpireAssignments in ```getpim``` command.
* Az-* PowerShell libraries upgrade:
    * This release of DevOps Kit has been updated to use the new Az-* PowerShell libraries (v.3.4.0). By and large, this should be a seamless transition for DevOps Kit users.
    * We have also updated control recommendation, fix-scripts etc. to reflect the change due to this upgrade.
* (Preview) AzSK module for Azure DevOps (ADO):
    * Packaged the DevOps Kit scanner for ADO as a native ADO extension that can be used for Continuous Assurance for ADO security. This also includes widgets to visualize the scan results for various stakeholders (such as org admin, project owners, build/release owners etc.).
    * Scan reports are now segregated by individual projects in the extension dashboard.
    * Added support to target scans using parameters/switches like baseline controls & severity in the native ADO extension task.
    * Resolved scalability issues to scan organizations with large number of projects/pipelines/service connections/agent pools.
* Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
    * N/A.
* In-cluster security scans for ADB, AKS, HDI Spark:
    * N/A.
* Log Analytics:
    * N/A.
* ARM Template Checker:
    * N/A.
* Org policy/external user updates (for non-CSEO users):
    * N/A.
Note: The next few items mention features from recent releases retained for visibility in case you missed those release announcements:
*	(Preview) AzSK module for Azure DevOps (ADO/VSTS) 
    *	You can try the scan cmdlet using:
    ```Powershell
    #VSTS scan cmdlet is in a separate module called AzSK.AzureDevOps!
    Install-Module AzSK.AzureDevOps -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber    
    Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "MicrosoftIT"`
                                        -ProjectNames "OneITVSO"`
                                        -BuildNames "build_name_here"`
                                        -ReleaseNames "release_name_here"  
    ```
*	Credential Hygiene helper cmdlets  
    * ```New-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to onboard a credential for tracking via DevOps Kit. You can set the reminder period (in days) for the credential.
    * ```Get-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to list the onboarded credential(s).
    * ```Update-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to update the credential settings and reset the last updated timestamp.
    * ```Remove-AzSKTrackedCredential``` to deboard a credential from AzSK tracking.
*	Privileged Identity Management (PIM) helper cmdlets (from last sprint)  
    * ```Set-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` (alias ```setpim```) for configuring/changing PIM settings
    * ```Get-AzSKPIMConfiguration``` (alias ```getpim```) for querying various PIM settings/status
    * Activating your PIM role is now as simple as this:
    ``` setpim -ActivateMyRole -SubscriptionId $sub -RoleName Owner -DurationInHours 8 -Justification 'ad hoc test'  ```
    * See docs [here](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/01-Subscription-Security/Readme.md#azsk-privileged-identity-management-pim-helper-cmdlets-1) for more.
*	(Preview) Security Scan for Azure Active Directory (AAD)
    *	You can scan security controls for your AAD tenant (as either an admin or even as a regular user) using the DevOps Kit AAD Security Scan module.
    *	Use following steps:
        ```Powershell
        # AAD scan cmdlets are packaged as a separate module (AzSK.AAD)
        Install-Module AzSK.AAD -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber
        Import-Module AzSK.AAD
        Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusTenant    # check the tenant (admin)
        Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusUser      # check objects you own (user)
        ``` 
    *	Caveats: 
        * Do not run these in the same PS session as AzSK. Start a new PS console.
        * Az- modules require .Net Framework v4.7.2.
        * By default, the current cmdlets will scan just 3 objects of each type (Apps/SPNs/Groups, etc.). This is until we work out how best to group/batch scans when scanning the entire tenant. If you want to scan more objects you can use the '-MaxObj' switch in the cmdlets.
