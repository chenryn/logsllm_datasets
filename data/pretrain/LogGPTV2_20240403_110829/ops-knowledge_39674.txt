To effectively implement CIS Control 10.5, "Enable Anti-Exploitation Features," an organization should follow these main procedures:

1. **Identify Applicable Assets and Software:** Determine which enterprise assets and software can support anti-exploitation features. This includes operating systems, applications, and other critical infrastructure components.

2. **Enable Built-in Anti-Exploitation Features:**
   - **For Windows Systems:**
     - Enable Microsoft® Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to prevent code execution from non-executable memory regions.
     - Configure Windows® Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) to provide additional protection against a wide range of exploits, including those targeting zero-day vulnerabilities.
   - **For macOS Systems:**
     - Enable Apple® System Integrity Protection (SIP) to protect the integrity of system files and processes.
     - Use Gatekeeper™ to control which sources of software are allowed to run on the system, ensuring that only trusted applications are executed.

3. **Regularly Update and Patch:**
   - Keep all systems and software up to date with the latest security patches and updates to ensure that known vulnerabilities are mitigated.
   - Regularly review and apply updates for anti-exploitation features to stay ahead of emerging threats.

4. **Monitor and Audit:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring to detect any attempts to bypass or disable anti-exploitation features.
   - Conduct regular audits to verify that anti-exploitation features are enabled and functioning correctly.

5. **Train and Educate Staff:**
   - Provide training and awareness programs for IT staff and end-users to understand the importance of anti-exploitation features and how to use them effectively.
   - Ensure that staff are aware of the potential risks and the steps they can take to help maintain the security of the organization's assets.

CIS Control 10.5 is categorized under the asset type "Devices" and falls under the security function "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can significantly enhance their defenses against exploitation and reduce the risk of successful attacks.
