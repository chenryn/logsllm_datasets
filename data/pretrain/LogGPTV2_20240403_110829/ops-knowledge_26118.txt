User: HI actually I was working on a project which i intended to deploy on the google appengine.
However I found that google app engine is supported by python. Can I run openCV  with python scripts on Google app engine?
Assistant: Now it is possible. The app should be deployed using a custom runtime in the GAE flexible environment. OpenCV library can be installed by adding the instruction RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python-opencv in the Dockerfile.
