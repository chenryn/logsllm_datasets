### Current Behavior:
Self signed certificate in chain after upgrading to npm 7 from npm 6 latest.
    npm WARN registry Unexpected warning for https://registry.npmjs.org/: Miscellaneous Warning SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN: request to https://registry.npmjs.org/@babel%2fparser failed, reason: self signed certificate in certificate chain

    cafile = "/Users/joren/certs/foo.ca-bundle"

    ; cwd = /Users/joren/code/lion
    ; HOME = /Users/joren
    ; Run `npm config ls -l` to show all defaults.
Turning strict-ssl to `false` as a workaround also doesn't work, I get the
same error. And I want strict-ssl to be on, of course :).
If I downgrade back to npm 6, it works again.
### Expected Behavior:
npm 7 to handle my `~/.npmrc` cafile config properly.
### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Use a proxy
  2. Use any private NPM registry
  3. Use my config as noted above, but edit the values to sync with your proxy and private NPM registry
  4. Create some certificates and bundle them as one, add the path to this bundle to your npm config cafile
  5. Verify things are working fine with npm 6
  6. Upgrade to npm 7 (`npm i -g npm@7`)
  7. npm install anywhere, see the error.
### Environment:
  * OS: MacOS Catalina 10.15.5
  * Node: 14.13.0
  * npm: 7.0.8
