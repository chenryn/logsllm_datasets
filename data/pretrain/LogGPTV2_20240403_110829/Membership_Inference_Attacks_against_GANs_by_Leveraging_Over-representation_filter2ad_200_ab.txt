#### Our Attack Method
Our attack method consists of three steps, which are also detailed in Algorithm 1.

1. **MC Score Construction**:
   - In the first step, we construct MC scores that represent the degree of over-representation in each region.
   - To estimate these MC scores, we train a substitute model by querying the target model. This process can be viewed as a model extraction attack against the GAN [7], aiming to replicate the target GAN's functionality and implicit data distribution.
   - Data used for training the substitute model is considered as members, while data sampled from the target model but not used for training the substitute model is regarded as nonmembers.
   - We use the discriminator’s outputs, converted to a fixed interval via the sigmoid function, to split regions (Algorithm 1, lines 5-7). Since the discriminator’s output is a single value, we divide the range of outputs into \( k \) parts, or regions. Finally, we calculate the MC score for each part using the substitute model (Algorithm 1, line 8).

2. **MC Score Assignment**:
   - In the second step, we assign an MC score to each suspect sample from the target dataset \( X_{\text{target}} \), based on the distance between each suspect sample and each region (Algorithm 1, lines 10-16).

3. **Membership Prediction**:
   - In the final step, a sample with an MC score higher than a threshold \( \tau \) is predicted as a member (Algorithm 1, lines 17-18).

#### Comparison with Existing Methods
Our method is similar to membership inference attacks against discriminative models [15], where top-1 confidence scores are used as features. However, our attack does not require any assumptions about the training set, unlike attacks on discriminative models, which need a shadow dataset from the same distribution as the training set.

#### Experimental Results
Table 1 summarizes the attack performance, including precision, recall, and AUCROC/accuracy, for different target models. Our method achieves significantly higher mean precision compared to LOGAN, even when the overall accuracy or AUCROC is around 50%.

#### Datasets and Target Models
- **Dataset**: We use the FFHQ dataset [9], which contains 70,000 human face images. The dataset is split into a training set (60,000 images) and a test set. The target set, used for evaluating membership inference attacks, consists of an equal number of member samples (randomly selected from the training set) and nonmember samples (randomly selected from the test set). Images are resized to 64 × 64, and the target set size is 20,000.
- **Target Models**: We choose PGGAN [8] and StyleGAN [9] as our target models due to their excellent performance and widespread adoption. The best Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [6] during training is used to select the target models. Specifically, the FID for StyleGAN and PGGAN are 5.05 and 6.59, respectively.

#### Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision**: We use precision as the key indicator to evaluate attack performance because it better captures the severity of training set leakage. Precision refers to the ratio of true-positive member samples in all positive inferences.
- **Comparison**: We compare our method with LOGAN [5], using the suggested hyperparameters for LOGAN. For our method, the threshold is set to the 99.99th percentile of all MC scores of the target set, and the number of clusters is 100. Experiments are repeated five times to evaluate attack performance.

#### Results
- **Performance**: Table 1 shows that our method achieves much higher mean precision than LOGAN on both target models, even with an accuracy or AUCROC around 50%. The maximum precision achieved by our method in some cases is 100%, indicating that all predicted member samples are true members.
- **Recall**: High precision comes at the expense of recall, as we only consider samples with higher MC scores. This suggests that not all training samples are easily inferred, and there are only some vulnerable samples in the training set, consistent with observations in other machine learning models [1, 2, 11].

### Conclusion
In this poster, we present a novel membership inference attack against GANs, focusing on precision. Our method leverages over-representation regions of a GAN model to make inferences. Initial experimental evaluations show that our method can achieve high-precision membership inference, even though the overall attack accuracy is around 50% for well-trained models.

### Future Work
- **Generalization**: We aim to relax our assumptions and generalize our approach to more challenging attack scenarios.
- **Defenses**: It will be interesting to design possible defense measures against our new attack. Differential privacy has shown promise in defending against privacy attacks, but an effective strategy for training GANs to produce high-quality images remains to be developed.
