Assistant: This log chunk shows the QuorumCnxManager software component attempting to establish connections with other nodes. It is interrupted multiple times due to connection errors, and the SendWorker and RecvWorker threads are interrupted as a result. Three connection requests are received from 10.10.34.12, 10.10.34.11, and 10.10.34.13.
