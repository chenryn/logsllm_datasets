## Abstract
The city of Miami, in collaboration with several commercial partners, plans to implement a "smart grid" citywide electrical infrastructure by 2011. This initiative was announced shortly after reports emerged that foreign agents had infiltrated the existing electrical infrastructure and recent penetration tests uncovered numerous vulnerabilities in the proposed technologies. Concurrently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released a roadmap for developing smart grid standards. In this whitepaper, I will discuss the shortcomings of the current guidelines and draw parallels with the criticisms of similar regulatory mandates, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which rely heavily on self-regulation by organizations.

## Introduction
### What is the Smart Grid?
The smart grid is an advanced electrical infrastructure that uses digital technology to deliver electricity from suppliers to consumers. The proposed technology will enable suppliers to remotely monitor consumer usage and implement variable rates based on peak energy use times. Additionally, consumers will be able to monitor their energy consumption in real time, potentially saving money by conserving energy during peak periods. The primary goals of the smart grid initiative are to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and safety of the country's electrical infrastructure.

## Security Initiatives
Every security-related document regarding the smart grid emphasizes the need to integrate security from the outset. This represents a significant improvement over previous technology initiatives and indicates that organizations and elected officials are beginning to understand the importance of security in project management.

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 tasked the Department of Energy with developing the smart grid program. The Department of Energy then assigned NIST the responsibility of creating a framework for interoperability, including the security of the smart grid. As a result, NIST initiated the Smart Grid Interoperability Project to develop the necessary framework.

## Timeframes
These initiatives, along with upcoming legislation aimed at advancing the smart grid rollout, demonstrate that the smart grid has garnered significant attention from elected officials. However, these efforts may not ensure that security is integrated from the beginning, as utility companies have been implementing smart grid components for several years. Below is a timeline of key security initiatives:

- **Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007**
  - Initial bill passed by the House of Representatives: January 18, 2007
  - Final bill signed into law: December 18, 2007

- **Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) System Security Requirements v1.01**
  - AMI-SEC Task Force formed: August 23, 2007
  - Released: December 17, 2008

- **NIST Smart Grid Interoperability Framework**
  - Initial list of standards for version 1.0 released: May 8, 2009

- **Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act (CEIPA) - (HR 2195)**
  - Introduced: April 30, 2009

However, smart grid design and implementation began several years before these initiatives. For example, Austin Energy started designing and implementing their smart grid in 2002, and the Salt River Project began installing smart meters in 2006. Despite the good intentions of security initiatives and elected officials, they have missed the opportunity to integrate security from the start by several years. Similar to other industries, the next electrical infrastructure will likely feature security as an add-on applied after the smart grid is implemented.

## History Repeating
As of the writing of this white paper, NIST has released a draft framework for review that includes some of the proposed standards. While the framework lists several security standards, NIST appears to be making the same mistakes as previous regulatory bodies. For instance, the PCI DSS standards have been criticized for not requiring sufficient security in environments processing cardholder data. This highlights the difference between being compliant and being secure.

One major criticism of PCI DSS is its reliance on self-policing. Credit card companies (American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc.) are responsible for ensuring that relevant companies comply with the standards. If a company is found non-compliant, the credit card companies issue what they consider appropriate penalties. For merchants processing a certain volume of credit card transactions, PCI requires them to complete a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) rather than undergo an on-site assessment by an approved third party. This approach relies on the "honor system" to ensure compliance, allowing companies to potentially report inaccurate security controls.

Similarly, a recent analysis by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reported that many utilities underreport their critical cyber assets, possibly to avoid compliance requirements. These findings suggest that utilities should not be trusted to ensure proper security implementation.

The new framework to be released by NIST will also rely on self-policing by utility companies. Currently, there are no processes to ensure that utility companies adhere to the proposed NIST standards. Previous incidents, such as the failure of numerous utilities to mitigate the Aurora vulnerability despite advisories from NERC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), indicate that utility companies do not always follow recommendations to address vulnerabilities.

The new standards also lack critical details on how to implement security requirements. Energy and technology companies will need to determine how to implement high-level requirements. For example, while authentication mechanisms are required for controlling access to devices, the specific mechanisms (password-based, PKI-based, or two-factor authentication) and the resources needed for effective implementation remain unclear.

## Counter Arguments
Discussions about tighter regulation and security often raise concerns about stifling innovation. While security and regulation should not hinder innovation, they must be balanced to ensure proper security measures are in place. Without adequate regulation, utility companies may not maintain a robust security posture. Recent penetration tests have shown that proper security mechanisms are not currently built into smart grid components. Vulnerabilities in smart meters could allow an attacker to gain complete control, potentially executing a wide-scale Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the electrical infrastructure. These vulnerabilities, combined with the industry's existing challenges, argue for stringent regulation to ensure security integration in the smart grid.

## Recommendations
Smart grid implementations have been rolled out in various cities across the United States and globally for several years. The opportunity to integrate security from the beginning has passed, but most implementations have been small. Before larger rollouts, such as the one planned in Miami, the security frameworks and initiatives surrounding smart grid technology should be allowed to mature.

While NIST is the appropriate organization to issue security requirements, more detailed and granular requirements are needed. Technology companies should not be left to decide on authentication mechanisms or encryption key sizes; NIST should provide these specifics.

In 2010, FERC is expected to gain the authority to fine utility companies up to $1 million per day for non-compliance with security standards. While this will increase pressure on utility companies to become compliant, a significant portion of the smart grid will already be deployed. As recent studies show, these devices may not be compliant, and utility companies will be forced to add security as an afterthought. Therefore, the current rollouts of smart grid technology should be suspended until all components meet stringent security standards.

Most discussions about smart grid security focus on the risks to utility consumers, but the risk to utility companies is equally severe. Exploiting the previously mentioned vulnerabilities, end-users could adjust the amount of electricity reported back to their utility company, leading to potential theft and significant revenue loss. Thus, utility companies should adhere to security recommendations to prevent such losses.

## Conclusion
Experts attribute the current economic downturn to the deregulation of banks, which allowed them to issue risky loans. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan admitted to trusting free markets to regulate themselves without government oversight. Similarly, utility and technology companies associated with the new electrical infrastructure should not be trusted to self-regulate. Strict oversight is necessary to ensure these companies adhere to proper security standards.
