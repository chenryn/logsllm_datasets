Abstract 
The city of Miami and several commercial partners plan to rollout a “smart 
grid” citywide electrical infrastructure by the year 2011. This rollout was 
announced on the heels of news that foreign agents have infiltrated our 
existing electrical infrastructure and that recent penetration tests have 
uncovered 
numerous 
vulnerabilities 
in 
the 
proposed 
technologies. 
Simultaneously, the National Institute for Standards in Technology (“NIST”) 
has recently released a roadmap for producing smart grid standards. In this 
whitepaper, I will discuss the flaws with the current guidelines and map 
them to the criticisms of similar regulatory mandates, including the Payment 
Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), that rely heavily on 
organizations policing themselves. 
What is the Smart Grid? 
The smart grid provides electricity from suppliers to consumers using digital 
technology. The proposed technology will allow suppliers to remotely 
monitor consumer usage as well as implement variable rates that increase 
and decrease during peak energy use times. Additionally, consumers will be 
able to monitor their energy use in real time, which could allow them to save 
money by conserving energy during peak energy use times. The major goals 
of the smart grid initiative are to increase efficiency, reliability, and safety of 
the country’s electrical infrastructure.  
Security Initiatives 
Every security-related document regarding the smart grid discusses and 
requires security to be integrated into the smart grid from the very 
beginning. This is a significant improvement over previous technology 
initiatives and shows that organizations and elected officials are beginning to 
understand at some level how to manage security in projects.  
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 provided the 
Department of Energy with the responsibility of developing the smart grid 
program. The Department of Energy then assigned NIST the responsibility of 
developing a framework of interoperability, including security of the smart 
grid [1]. As a result, NIST has started the Smart Grid Interoperability Project 
to develop the framework [2] for the smart grid.  
Timeframes 
These initiatives, along with upcoming legislation on advancing the smart 
grid rollout, show the smart grid has received attention from the country’s 
elected officials. However, these initiatives cannot ensure that security is 
integrated from the beginning since utility companies have been rolling out 
smart grid components for the past several years. Below is a list of example 
security initiatives with their associated timeframe: 
• Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 
o Initial bill passed by the House of Representatives on January 
18, 2007 
o Final bill signed into law on December 18, 2007. [3] 
• Advanced 
Metering 
Infrastructure 
(AMI) 
System 
Security 
Requirements v1.01 
o AMI-SEC Task Force formed on August 23, 2007 [4] 
o Released on December 17, 2008. [5] 
• NIST Smart Grid Interoperability Framework 
o Initial list of standards for inclusion in version 1.0 released on 
May 8, 2009. [2] 
• Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act (CEIPA) - (HR 2195) 
o Introduced April 30, 2009 [6]. 
Alternatively, smart grid design and implementations were initiated several 
years prior to these initiatives. For example, Austin Energy began designing 
and implementing their smart grid in 2002 [7] and the Salt River Project 
began installing smart meters in 2006 [8]. Although the security initiatives 
and elected officials have good intentions, they have missed the window of 
opportunity to truly integrate security from the beginning by several years. 
Similar to the credit card industry, banking industry, health care industry, 
and most industries that conduct business online, the next electrical 
infrastructure will have security featured as an add-on that is applied after 
the smart grid is implemented. 
History Repeating 
As of the writing of this white paper, NIST has released a draft framework 
for review that includes some of the proposed standards. While there are 
several security standards listed in the framework, NIST appears to be 
making the same mistakes of previous regulatory mandate governing 
bodies. For example, the PCI DSS standards have been criticized for not 
requiring sufficient security in environments that process cardholder data. 
This argument embodies the difference between compliant and secure. 
Specifically, one of the major criticisms is the “self policing” aspect of these 
standards. The credit card companies (American Express, Discover Financial 
Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc.) are 
responsible for ensuring that relevant companies are compliant with the 
standards. If a company is deemed non-compliant, then the credit card 
companies issue what they consider to be the appropriate punishment. 
For merchants that do a certain amount of credit card transactions, PCI 
requires them to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire (“SAQ”), as 
opposed to an on-site assessment by an approved third party, to determine 
whether the merchant adheres to certain security controls. This approach 
relies on the “honor system” to ensure that companies are compliant with 
the PCI DSS. As a result, a company could potentially report inaccurate 
security controls in their SAQ. Similarly, a recent analysis by the North 
American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) reported, “many utilities 
are underreporting their critical cyber assets, potentially to avoid compliance 
requirements.” [9] These results show that the utilities should not be trusted 
to ensure that proper security is implemented.   
The new framework, to be released by NIST, will rely on “self policing” by 
the utility companies as well. Currently, there are no processes to ensure 
that utility companies adhere to the proposed standards released by NIST. 
As shown by previous incidents, the utility companies do not always follow 
the recommendations to mitigate vulnerabilities. For example, the Homeland 
Security Committee recently released that numerous utilities did not 
mitigate a vulnerability, known as Aurora. Despite advisories from both 
NERC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), the utilities 
had not implemented the recommendations to mitigate the risk associated 
with this vulnerability. [9] 
The new standards also leave out critical details on how to implement the 
security requirements. As a result, energy companies and technology 
companies will need to determine how to implement the high level 
requirements. For example, authentication mechanisms are required for 
controlling access to devices. However, what authentication mechanisms 
should be used? Will the authentication be password based or PKI based? 
Should two-factor authentication be required? Will the utility companies have 
the resources necessary to implement strong authentication effectively? The 
answers to these questions will need to be addressed by the energy and 
technology companies implementing the smart grid. 
Counter Arguments 
When discussing tighter regulation or security, the arguments of innovation 
being stifled will inevitably arise. Security and regulation should not prevent 
innovation; however, the proper levels of security and regulation need to be 
in place. As previously discussed, without proper regulation, the utility 
companies may not maintain a proper security posture. Additionally, recent 
penetration tests have shown that proper security mechanisms are not 
currently built into components of the smart grid. Recently discovered 
vulnerabilities in smart meters have been identified that could allow an 
attacker to obtain complete control of the meters. Specifically, an attacker 
could exploit these vulnerabilities to turn off electricity to hundreds of 
thousands of home. [10] Thus, an attacker could execute a wide-scale 
Denial of Service (“DoS”) attack on the electrical infrastructure. These new 
vulnerabilities combined with the previously discussed issues that the 
industry faces provide the argument that tight regulation needs to be in 
place to ensure security is integrated into the smart grid. 
Recommendations 
Smart grid implementations have been rolled out in various cities across the 
United States as well as rest of the world for several years. The opportunity 
to integrate security into the smart grid from the very beginning has already 
passed; however, most of the implementations have been small. Before 
larger implementations, such as the smart grid rollout in Miami, the security 
frameworks and initiatives surrounding the smart grid technology should be 
allowed to mature.  
While NIST is the proper organization to issue the security requirements, 
more granular requirements need to be addressed. Technology companies 
should not be left to determine which authentication mechanism to 
implement or what encryption key size to use. NIST should be responsible 
for determining these requirements. 
In 2010, FERC is supposed to receive the authority to begin fining utility 
companies up to $1 million dollars a day for non-compliance with security 
standards. [11] While this will increase pressure on the utility companies to 
become compliant, a large portion of the smart grid will have been rolled out 
across the country already. As shown in the recent studies, these devices 
will not be compliant and utility companies will be forced to add security as a 
feature. As such, the current rollouts of smart grid technology should be 
suspended until all components are compliant with stringent security 
standards. 
The majority of discussion surrounding smart grid security has focused on 
what attackers could do to utility consumers. However, the risk to utility 
companies 
is 
just 
as 
severe. 
Utilizing 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
vulnerabilities [10], end-users could attempt to adjust the amount of 
electricity reported back to their utility company. Thus, end-users could be 
allowed to steal utilities, costing utility companies millions of dollars a year. 
As a result, the utility companies should adhere to the security 
recommendations to prevent loss of revenue.  
Conclusion 
Most experts attribute the current economic downturn to the deregulation of 
banks that allowed them to issue risky loans. When questioned by a 
congressional committee, the former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan stated that he made a “mistake” [12] in trusting that free 
markets could regulate themselves without government oversight. Similarly, 
the utility and technology companies associated with the new electrical 
infrastructure should not be trusted to regulate themselves and strict 
oversight should be applied to ensure that these companies adhere to proper 
security standards.
