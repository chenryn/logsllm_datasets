Assistant: Possible problems and suggestions: 1. Gzip compression is not enabled, it is recommended to enable gzip compression by adding the following parameters: gzip on; gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript; 2. The setting of worker_processes to 4 may be too high, and it should be adjusted appropriately according to the server hardware; 3. The IP address specified when proxy_pass is forwarded is 127.0.0.1. If the backend service is not on the same server as Nginx, it may not be possible to connect. It is recommended to use the actual IP address or domain name; 4. If no cache is set, it is recommended to set the reverse proxy cache by adding the following parameters: proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m inactive=60m; proxy_cache_key " $scheme$request_method$host$request_uri"; proxy_cache_valid 200 60m; proxy_cache_valid 404 1m; 5. No SSL certificate is set. If you need to enable the HTTPS protocol, you need to add an SSL certificate and related configurations.
