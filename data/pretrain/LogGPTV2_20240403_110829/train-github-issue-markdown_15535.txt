I see there is help text in the online manual but it doesn't seem to be
accessible from the REPL.
    help?> include
    include_from_node1 (generic function with 1 method)
I presume this is because the `include` symbol gets reassigned at some point.
    julia> methods(include)
    #1 method for generic function "include_from_node1":
    include_from_node1(path::AbstractString) at loading.jl:119
