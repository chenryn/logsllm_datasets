User: This is a really annoying problem. I've prowled the web for solutions, but all I found was tips about changing the PATH variable, which I did, of course. My Python install directory is C:\Python27. It' a 32 bit version. Whenever I type python in the command prompt, it says that it isn't recognised as an internal or external command. Currently, my PATH variable is set to C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python27\Scripts. Anyone has any ideas? I run Windows 7 by the way (64 bit). I'm pretty desperate. Heck, if nothing works I guess I'll try dual-booting Linux and Windows 7...
Assistant: Okay, as you said your Python install directory is C:\Python27, open my computer, then open c: drive, 
if you don't see "Python27" named folder there then try to search it using search option, (in my case i found it in old.window folder, don't know how it moved there) cut and past it in c drive along with folders like, program files, user etc... , now open cmd and type python and hit enter to check if it is working now,
