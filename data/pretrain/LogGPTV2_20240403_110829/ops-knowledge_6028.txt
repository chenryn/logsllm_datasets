Question: "In a security log entry, you encounter a Security ID (SID) that could not be resolved to an account name. What should be your next steps to handle this situation? (Select two)"
 "A": "Consult the security database to find the associated account, as SIDs are unique and never reused for different accounts."
 "B": "Disregard the event, as unresolved SIDs indicate a system error rather than a security issue."
 "C": "Attempt to correlate the SID with other security events that might have the same SID resolved to an account name."
 "D": "Consider the SID as a potential indicator of a compromised system, since unresolved SIDs are commonly used by attackers."
