Section 5  The main point
When you have a small medium or large business, it's always important to have good security.  Most of 
these examples, and my credit card experience, is in the hospitality industry.  For some odd reason, they 
never got the memo that security is a good thing.  Most are focused on "Customer Satisfaction" "Tai Chi / 
Guest experience" and, for smaller hotels, easy money with a simple business plan.  This leaves the hotel 
industry wide open for exploits when the upgrade their credit card authorization to internal networks tying 
into modems and the Internet.  Even with the flood of computer professionals on the market, they look to the
bottom line, and cannot justify "proactive" hiring, only seasonal "reactive".  Further the credit card industry 
is very loose and dynamic right now.  There are many unregulated area's, even for an industry as sensitive 
as it is.  There has been no real push to make it fully secure, so this leaves us with a new target to lean in on. 
What if I did work at a hotel, and I wanted to protect my card assets?  What would be necessarily?  Is it all 
that hard to secure my credit card networks?
Part 3  How this can be avoided
Section 1  Protecting against social engineering
There are many different ways to protect against this method, good and bad.  When a client of mine went 
overboard, and thought he was being attacked by terrorist, calling his manager and demanding the police 
put a trace on his phone-  This for me calling in to do a software patch update - things can obviously get out
of hand.  But it does not have to be that tight.  If someone calls in to do work, call them back, listen for an 
automated service that give out the company name.  Check that the number they provide is the same you 
have on file when you call them.  Call the vendor back, but only with the support number you have.
When people want free money from you, sometimes training the whole staff will not get the message across, 
and it can coast too much, if it will only happen once to you.  Delegate one or two people, maybe an auditor, 
who can handle charge back requests exclusively.  Always, always, always call your bank to verify that 
money was or was not deposited into your account from said client, don't assume your system is right, or 
the client for that matter.  This applies, even if they fax a statement in.
Section 2  Protecting your network
What merchants fail to understand is that they have a large amount of sensitive data going across their 
network, and they have no concept of "Plugging holes".  Even in a half-hearted way.  We are in the middle 
of a bad recession, now more then every merchants are using "If it's not broke..." analogy's to justify why 
they leave back doors open.  They refuse to invest money into protected their most valuable assets, their 
clients.  Even still, just investing in good security practices, and making even a modest investment in 
network security would close 99% of the hacks they are currently exposed to.
Using unique ID's is not just good practice, it is a regulation for anyone entering in, or accessing credit 
cards to a credit card network.  Limiting access and rights also falls under this category.  Make sure when 
someone gets fired, their accounts are deactivated.  Have cooperate traffic separate from client "in room" 
traffic, and Wi-Fi hot spots in the lobby is also essential.  Having a business class firewall is required for all 
merchants who propagate traffic across the Internet, secured or not.  When big credit card vendors (Visa, 
Master Card, etc) really start their audit of merchants, fines can and will be accrual, and acceptance rights 
will be revoked.  This of corse, is pretty obvious to you, but not to the non-existent network administrators 
out there.
My only point with firewalls everyone knows, close all ports, period.  What hard about opening a port for 
credit card traffic with a rule like "allow ip from x to y out established portx" and "deny ip from y to x in 
portx".  Well to that effect anyway.
Section 3  Protecting you against yourself
Although many sites may be locked down, and traffic separated, there still lays a risk of compromise.  A 
smart hack may work part-time for you, helping out to make ends meet during the recession, or just cause it's 
a quick buck during his college years.  As small as computers are getting, he could drop one in on your 
network and still grab packets.  What can be done about these obscure threats?  Encrypt traffic from POS 
systems to Credit Card Terminal systems.  Adding services like internal VPN or Stunnel technology would 
plug up this type of hole.  Even if you could not afford to segregate traffic, simply putting this in place 
would null in void 90% of problems to began with.
Another afterthought on protecting you against you, mission critical, it is a good word to label a credit card 
terminal.  Most cc network terminals are nothing more then software and services installed on windows and 
UNIX based PC's.  It shows fitting that some see this computer as a multimedia device, an Internet terminal, 
or even an extra computer used for LAN games.  During your boring life as a sales associate, playing games 
on your cell phone, or bringing in a Game Boy can help.  But it's this easy to use a device for something 
other then it's purpose, such as a cell phone, that drives people to this madness.  When I questioned my co-
worker on why someone would do this he replied "If a normal credit card terminal at the register could play 
video games, they would install them on it!"  I guess this is human nature.  My reply STOP IT!  Don't waste 
my time because a virus got on your credit card terminal, because the email told you to run it's attached 
program.  And yes this is the hell that is my day to day routine, like said before, people just don't care, and 
these things happen.
Part 4  General Points of interest
Section 1 Visa CISP (Cardholder Information Security Program)
Visa CISP Audit guideline is a great place to start when attempting to protect your business from credit card 
fraud electronically.  CISP stands for "Cardholder Information Security Program".  It has been in existence 
for over 2 years, although it has only been fully implemented and followed in recent months.  Following 
basic guidelines that they have provided will surely give you more piece of mind.  They have created a 
"Digital Dozen(tm)" list.  This list is their twelve basic steps you can use to protect your credit card network. 
They are Install and maintain a working firewall, keep patches up-to-date, protect stored data, encrypt data 
across public networks, use anti-virus software, restrict access, use unique ID's for your users, avoid 
vendor default passwords, track access to data, have a security audit regularly, have an information security 
policy, restrict physical access to data.
Now obviously these are all "Duh" remarks, but, remember some of my cases studies.  Companies have no 
regard for these simple to implement systems.  Further they are in violation of Visa policy when they do not 
comply with the "Digital Dozen(tm)" program.  So, just setup a security audit, take the time to update service 
packs, and create unique user ID's.  For heaven's sake, get rid of that lynksys route / firewall / WEP / cheese 
grader!
Section 2  Unavoidable Threats
Although you can do your part, and protect your information to a "T", sometimes this is not enough.  
F.E.P.'s and ISO's can sometimes be lazy, and not make full checks of your identity.  For this reason, basic 
card terminals are being cloned every day.  Sometimes by people who work for these companies, and have 
full access to merchant information.  While the industry is working to get better security in place, there is 
still no "Great White Hype" as of yet.  This is why I am strongly against these terminals.  With credit card 
networks, their is a higher attention to detail with security, and the software is not fully available to the 
public.  Until a more premeditate solution is in place, all you can do is keep close tabs on your bank 
accounts.
Conclusion
Basically, as long as merchants take their networks from an objective standpoint, and put good procedures 
in place, they should have nothing to worry about.  But, if they do not, watch out, because now they have 
an army of enlightened soldiers coming after them!
