Running tests requires linking to `std`, where the test runner lives. core has
a huge hack in it to allow it to link to std when building with `--test`.
When building core tests (an executable), core links to std, which then links
to _the actual core shared library_. As a result coretest actually includes
two entire copies of core at runtime. The tests are exercising the core code
compiled into the executable, and std is exercising the core library.
This caused a confusing problem with the TLS tests which use function
addresses as keys, because std and coretest were using two different
functions.
Two solutions
  * move std::test to core
  * move core tests to their own crate
