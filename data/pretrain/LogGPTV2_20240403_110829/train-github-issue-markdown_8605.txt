Upon launching Atom for the first time, I noticed a significant increase in disk I/O. To investigate, I used `iotop` and identified four processes that were consuming a large amount of disk I/O:

1. **Process ID: 2288**
   - **User:** be/4
   - **Disk Read:** 717.17 K/s
   - **Disk Write:** 0.00 B/s
   - **I/O Usage:** 0.00%
   - **CPU Usage:** 98.51%
   - **Command:** `atom --eval require('/usr/local/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/coffee-cash/lib/~ee/source-maps')`

2. **Process ID: 2291**
   - **User:** be/4
   - **Disk Read:** 679.23 K/s
   - **Disk Write:** 0.00 B/s
   - **I/O Usage:** 0.00%
   - **CPU Usage:** 97.91%
   - **Command:** `atom --eval require('/usr/local/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/coffee-cash/lib/~ee/source-maps')`

3. **Process ID: 2290**
   - **User:** be/4
   - **Disk Read:** 694.40 K/s
   - **Disk Write:** 0.00 B/s
   - **I/O Usage:** 0.00%
   - **CPU Usage:** 97.41%
   - **Command:** `atom --eval require('/usr/local/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/coffee-cash/lib/~ee/source-maps')`

4. **Process ID: 2289**
   - **User:** be/4
   - **Disk Read:** 599.54 K/s
   - **Disk Write:** 0.00 B/s
   - **I/O Usage:** 0.00%
   - **CPU Usage:** 96.19%
   - **Command:** `atom --eval require('/usr/local/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/coffee-cash/lib/~ee/source-maps')`

These processes ran for approximately one minute, during which they consumed nearly 100% of the disk write usage. After this period, the disk I/O activity returned to normal.

**System Information:**
- **Atom Version:** 0.180.0-ac7057b
- **Hardware:** Dell M4500 Notebook
- **Operating System:** Fedora 21

This high disk I/O activity during the initial launch of Atom is likely due to the initialization and caching of certain resources. If this behavior persists or causes performance issues, you may want to check for updates or consider optimizing your system's storage configuration.
