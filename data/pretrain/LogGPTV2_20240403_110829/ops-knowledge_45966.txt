It appears that you are encountering an issue on a Windows Server 2003 system where, after entering the username and password, the screen displays "Loading personal settings..." but then automatically logs off and returns to the "Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to log in" prompt. This problem is likely due to a corrupted user profile.

To resolve this, follow these steps:

1. **Log in as Administrator:**
   - If possible, log in to the server using an administrator account.
   - Navigate to `C:\Documents and Settings` (or the appropriate drive letter if profiles are stored elsewhere).
   - Locate the folder corresponding to the problematic user account.
   - Rename this folder (e.g., from `Username` to `Username.old`).

2. **Try Logging In Again:**
   - Log out of the administrator account.
   - Attempt to log in with the problematic user account. A new, clean profile should be created automatically.

If you cannot log in as an administrator locally, you can try the following alternatives:

- **Network Access:**
  - Connect to the server over the network using the administrative share (e.g., `\\ServerName\C$`).
  - Follow the same steps to rename the user's profile folder.

- **Safe Mode:**
  - Reboot the server and enter Safe Mode by pressing F8 during startup and selecting "Safe Mode with Networking."
  - Log in as an administrator and rename the user's profile folder.

- **Recovery Disk:**
  - Use a recovery disk, such as ERD Commander, to boot the server.
  - Once booted, navigate to the user's profile folder and rename it.

After performing these steps, the user should be able to log in successfully with a new, uncorrupted profile.
