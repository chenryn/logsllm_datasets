User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unable to start on windows server 2003 After type in user name and password, the screen shows "loading personal settings....." and then immediately log-off automatically and back to the "ctrl-alt-del to login" page. Help!

Assistant: It sounds like the account you are using probably has a corrupt profile. Are you able to log in as the administrator account, rename the profile of the account you are having problems with, and try logging in again.

If you're not able to do that, you may be able to do it over the network using the admin C$ (or whatever drive letter your profiles are stored on) share, or failing that maybe booting into safe mode or from a recovery disk (something like ERD commander) and doing the same thing should work
