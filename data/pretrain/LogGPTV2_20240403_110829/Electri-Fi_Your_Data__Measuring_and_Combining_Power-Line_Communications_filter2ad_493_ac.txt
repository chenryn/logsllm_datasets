### Throughput and Cable Distance

**Figure 7: Throughput vs. Cable Distance and P Berr vs. Throughput**
- **Left Panel:** This figure illustrates the throughput (in Mbps) as a function of the cable distance between the source and destination for all links in the testbed.
- **Right Panel:** The relationship between the bit error rate (P Berr) and the available throughput is shown. As expected, P Berr decreases as throughput increases. However, some average links may have lower P Berr than the best links due to the dynamic updates of tone maps based on this metric.

### Observations
- **Asymmetry:** We observed that asymmetry was introduced in the experiment, consistent with findings in [13].

### Conclusion
- **Spatial Variation:** The spatial variation of the PLC channel depends on:
  1. The structure of the electrical network, including the appliances attached and their positions.
  20. The distance between the stations.
- **Channel Asymmetry:** PLC channels are highly asymmetric, which is a key feature contributing to their spatial variability.
- **Performance Optimization:** To optimize performance in terms of throughput and delay, hybrid networks need to estimate the number of retransmissions a frame suffers due to channel errors. The metric P Berr can be used to predict the expected number of retransmissions.

### Temporal Variation of PLC Channels

#### Introduction
- **Background:** There is limited knowledge about the temporal variation of PLC channels. A study of temporal variation could improve the quality of service in hybrid networks and the accuracy of link metrics estimation.

#### Channel Modeling Components
- **Noise Variation:** We examine the noise generated by attached electrical appliances.
- **Attenuation Variation:** We also investigate the variation of the channel transfer function or attenuation.

#### Timescales of Channel Variation
- **Invariance Scale (Subintervals of Mains Cycle):** 
  - Duration: Subintervals of the mains cycle (e.g., 6 tone-map slots in HPAV).
  - Characteristics: Periodic noise synchronous to the mains cycle (20 ms).
  - Example: BLEs changes periodically with a period of 10 ms.
- **Cycle Scale (Multiples of Mains Cycle):**
  - Duration: Multiples of the mains cycle (ms or s).
  - Characteristics: Noise variability for each tone-map slot.
- **Random Scale (Minutes or Hours):**
  - Duration: Minutes or hours.
  - Characteristics: Electrical load variability, leading to changes in attenuation.

#### Notations and Variables
- **Tone-Map Slots (L):** Total number of subintervals of the mains cycle.
- **BLEs (1 ≤ s ≤ L):** Bit Loading Efficiency for each tone-map slot.
- **µs and σs:** Expected value and standard deviation of BLEs, respectively.
- **νσs:** Continuous random variable with zero mean and variance σ²s.

#### Invariance Scale
- **Impact:** Affected by the noise levels produced by appliances at different subintervals of the mains cycle.
- **Consequences:** Direct impact on estimating link metrics. All tests showed varying noise levels.

#### Cycle Scale
- **Evaluation:** Using the average BLE over all tone-map slots (BLE = ΣBLEs/6).
- **Behavior:**
  - **Bad Links:** Tend to modify tone maps more frequently and have higher standard deviations.
  - **Average Links:** Vary less than bad links but can still have high standard deviations during periods of frequent changes.
  - **Good Links:** Tone maps can be valid for several seconds, with minor increments or decrements.

#### Asymmetry in Temporal Variability
- **Observation:** Asymmetry not only affects average performance but also temporal variation.
- **Channel Estimation Algorithms:** Different algorithms (e.g., HPAV vs. HPAV500) show varying behaviors, especially in handling bursty errors.

#### Random Scale
- **Variation:** During timescales of minutes, PLC channels do not vary much, with a standard deviation that depends on the electrical load and human activity.

### Conclusions
- **Cycle Scales:** Good links should be probed less often than bad links to reduce overhead.
- **Temporal Variation:** Understanding the temporal variation is crucial for optimizing link metrics and improving the quality of service in hybrid networks.
