### Title: Fault-Injection Detection Circuits: Design, Calibration, Validation, and Tuning at Black Hat US 2022

This session delves into the tunable replica circuit (TRC), a fault-injection detection circuit that has been integrated into the Intel® Converged Security and Management Engine (Intel® CSME) in the latest 12th Gen Intel® Core™ Processors. This marks Intel's first foray into active fault-injection attack detection in high-volume products such as CPUs and chipsets.

Fault-injection attacks often aim to induce timing failures, which can be exploited to execute unsigned code on security engines. To address this, Intel has adopted the TRC as a robust solution for detecting timing failures. Unlike traditional analog voltage and clock monitors, the TRC is designed to detect timing issues resulting from various glitch attacks, including voltage, clock, temperature, and electromagnetic radiation.

The session will cover:
- An introduction to TRC technology and its role in enhancing security.
- The integration of TRC into the Intel CSME.
- The calibration process for TRC in high-volume manufacturing (HVM).
- The results of false-positive and fault-injection testing conducted in Intel's physical attack labs.

By providing a comprehensive overview of the TRC, this session aims to highlight the importance of advanced fault-injection detection in modern security architectures.
