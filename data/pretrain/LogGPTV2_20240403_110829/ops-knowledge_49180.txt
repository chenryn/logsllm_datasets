User: How do I debug a Python extension written in C? I found some links that said we need to get the Python debug built, but how do we do that if we don't have root access? I have Python 2.7 installed.
Assistant: You can compile a debug-enabled version python in your home folder without having root access and develop the C extension against that version.
