User: I've got nbviewer installed and working. I see it has a --localfiles option that takes a folder name. It says: "Serving local notebooks in /home/gb/S14/inclass, this can be a security risk"
But I can't figure out the URL format to get it to look for the file there. The code adds a handler for /localfile/(.*) but that doesn't seem to get triggered.
Anyone know how to format name to give to trigger loading a local file?
Assistant: One minute later and it occurs to me that the front page might not support even though the server does. Sure enough, http://localhost:5000/localfile/PythonReference.ipynb?create=1 renders the local notebook.
