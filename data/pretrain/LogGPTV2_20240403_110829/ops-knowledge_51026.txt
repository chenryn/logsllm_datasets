 0 20:10:41 INFO Successfully started service 'sparkExecutorActorSystem' on port 55904.
 1 20:11:09 INFO Running task 28.0 in stage 27.0 (TID 1268)
 2 20:10:54 INFO Running task 2.0 in stage 8.0 (TID 349)

 4 20:11:08 INFO Running task 31.0 in stage 26.0 (TID 1231)
 5 20:10:58 INFO Running task 123.0 in stage 24.0 (TID 1150)
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Successfully started service 'sparkExecutorActorSystem' on port <*>. 和 Running task <*> in stage <*> (TID <*>)
B: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 Changing modify acls to: <*>
C: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT] 和 Changing modify acls to: <*>
D: Changing modify acls to: <*> 和 Slf4jLogger started
