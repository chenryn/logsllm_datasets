**User:**

I am building a Python script using a `setup.py` file. During the build process, it links to the Python framework, but it is linking to the wrong location. How can I set the correct framework path before building the script?

Thank you in advance for taking the time to help with this issue.

**Assistant:**

To ensure that your `setup.py` script links to the correct Python framework, you need to make sure that the environment is correctly configured. Here are the steps to set the framework path before building the script:

1. **Ensure `cx_Freeze` is Installed Correctly:**
   - Make sure that `cx_Freeze` is installed in the same Python environment where you intend to run the application. This will help ensure that the `PYTHONPATH` is set up correctly.

2. **Set the Framework Path:**
   - You can set the framework path by modifying the `setup.py` file. Add the `include_files` option to specify the correct path to the Python framework.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

     setup(
         name="YourAppName",
         version="0.1",
         description="Your app description",
         options={"build_exe": {"include_files": ["/path/to/correct/framework"]}},
         executables=[Executable("your_script.py")]
     )
     ```

3. **Modify `PYTHONPATH` (if necessary):**
   - If your script modifies the `PYTHONPATH`, you need to make the same modifications in the `setup.py` file or in the environment before running the build command.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import sys
     sys.path.append("/path/to/your/custom/library")
     ```

4. **Run the Build Command:**
   - After making these changes, run the build command as usual:
     ```sh
     python setup.py build
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to set the correct framework path and ensure that your script builds successfully.
