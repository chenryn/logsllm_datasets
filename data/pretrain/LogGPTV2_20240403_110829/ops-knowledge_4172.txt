User: I'm working with Codenvy writing a Google Appengine app, and I have found it to be INSANELY difficult to debug. If there's a syntax error I have to find it manually as the web page that loads when testing give me and error:500. Also, I often want to print but Codenvy doesn't support printing for python (that or I don't understand the correct method). Has anyone else experienced this and able to help?  Perhaps developing in the cloud isn't as easy as I was hoping...
Assistant: I discovered that if you go to the Google App Developper Console, there is a menu on the left. Click on App Engine, then click on Logs. There you can see the internal server error (error 500) log, which pretty much tell you what went wrong.
