### Vouching Site and Authentication Overhead

In traditional authentication, the vouching process requires a total time of \( t = RT_{TS} + RT_{TV} \) if performed sequentially. SAuth introduces an overhead of \( RT_{TS} + RT_{TV} \), which can be reduced to \( RT_T \) if the user logs into both services simultaneously. This additional overhead is only incurred in the absence of a persistent authentication token, such as a cookie, which we expect to be a rare occurrence.

### Hash Key Assumption

We assume a hash key of 512 bits.

#### Decoy Passwords
Kamouflage [27] proposes injecting dummy passwords into password managers to protect actual passwords if the master secret that unlocks the database is compromised. Similarly, honeywords [43] are fake passwords stored on the server alongside the authentic password. Honeywords require a trusted third party to ensure that the entered password is authentic and not a decoy during each login attempt.

#### k-Secret Sharing
Shamir et al. [52] proposed splitting a secret into \( k \) pieces and distributing them to distinct parties. The original secret can be reconstructed only if at least \( m < k \) pieces are present. This technique has been applied to distributed user authentication by splitting the stored password into multiple tokens [23, 33]. SAuth can be seen as an application of this technique, where the process of verifying each piece of the original password is called vouching. Instead of generating and splitting a new password, SAuth combines existing user passwords to benefit from the security of a long and distributed secret.

#### Bounded Retrieval
Crescenzo et al. [36] propose making the authentication database too large for an attacker to retrieve. The server maintains a set of very large random files, and each password is mapped to specific locations within these files. The sum of these locations represents the password's digest, requiring the full database to brute-force leaked hashes.

#### Authentication/Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0** [18] enables a third party to request access to a credential-restricted resource from its owner without knowing the owner’s credentials.
- **OpenID 2.0** [49] provides a way for an end user to prove ownership of a claimed identity to a third party without a separate account.
- **Facebook Connect** [46] builds on OAuth and OpenID to produce an authentication and authorization framework combined with social information and graph data.
- **BrowserID** (Mozilla Persona) [2] is a single-sign-on mechanism that uses email addresses to represent user identities.
- **PseudoID** [37] employs blind cryptographic signatures to eliminate privacy concerns.

### Proposed Federated Login System

In this paper, we propose a federated login system that facilitates passwordless logins for a variety of web services, similar to Facebook Connect. However, instead of using a single sign-on service like Facebook, our system allows the use of a federated sign-on service that includes platforms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter. These platforms act as vouching parties during the login process, making it harder for an attacker to exploit the single sign-on system.

### Conclusion

We have presented SAuth, a novel protocol for enhanced authentication in the event of a password database leak. Users wishing to access their account on service \( S \) must also authenticate for their account on service \( V \), which acts as a vouching party. Both services can be regular sites visited daily, such as email providers or social networks. The vouching process occurs implicitly through the user’s browser and remains largely transparent. With SAuth, an attacker who acquires the password for service \( S \) will be unable to log in unless they also compromise the password for \( V \). To mitigate password reuse, we employ decoy passwords to introduce uncertainty about the actual password. SAuth is an extension of existing authentication methods, operating one layer above them and enabling services to use heterogeneous systems.
