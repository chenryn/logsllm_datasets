During writing container attach node e2e test, I found this.
Docker attach has an option called `Logs` (see Docker Remote API).  
With this on, before each container attach docker will print the container log
first (see code)
The `Logs` option is supported in go-dockerclient (see code), while it is not
supported in engine-api yet (see code).
Before switching to engine-api, the `Logs` option is **true** (see old code).
While because engine-api doesn't support it, we don't set it now (see code)
What is the expected behavior here? If needed, we could send a PR to engine-
api to support it.
