While writing the end-to-end (e2e) test for container attachment to a node, I encountered an issue related to the `Logs` option in Docker attach. This option, as specified in the Docker Remote API, allows Docker to print the container log before each attachment (refer to the code here).

The `Logs` option is currently supported in the go-dockerclient library (see the relevant code), but it is not yet supported in the engine-api (refer to the corresponding code). Prior to the switch to engine-api, the `Logs` option was set to `true` (as seen in the old code). However, since engine-api does not support this option, it is no longer being set (see the current code).

Could you please clarify the expected behavior in this scenario? If necessary, we can submit a pull request (PR) to add support for the `Logs` option in the engine-api.
