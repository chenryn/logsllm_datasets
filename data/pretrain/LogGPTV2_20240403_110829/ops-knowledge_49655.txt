User: I want to push data to the browser over HTTP without killing my django/python application.
I decided to use a comet server, to proxy requests between my application and the client (though I still haven't really figured it out properly).
I've looked into the following engines:
orbited
cometd
ejabberd
jetty
Has anyone had any experience working with these servers and deploying them? Any insight and links regarding the topics would be great. Thank you.
Assistant: I would recommend looking into Twisted, their twisted.web server, and the comet work done on top of it at Divmod. They can handle far more concurrent connections than traditional thread or process based servers, which is exactly what you need for something like this. And, yes, I've architected systems using Twisted for COMET stuff, while using other things for the more front-facing web applications beside it. It works out well with each part doing what it does best.
