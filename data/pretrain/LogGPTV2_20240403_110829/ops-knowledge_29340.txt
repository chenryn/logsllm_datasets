User: I have installed Python and written a program in Notepad++. 
Now when I try to type the Python file name in the Run window, all that I see is a black window opening for a second and then closing. 
I cant run the file at all, how can run this file? 
Also I want to tell that I also tried to be in the same directory as a particular Python file but no success.
Assistant: I assume you are running the script with command python file_name.py.
You can prevent closing of the cmd by getting a character from user.
use raw_input() function to get a character (which probably could be an enter).
