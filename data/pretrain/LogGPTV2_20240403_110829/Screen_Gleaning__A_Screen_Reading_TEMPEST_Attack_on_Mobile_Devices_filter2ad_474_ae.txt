classiﬁcation scenario, which we call the generalization sce-
nario, in which the attacker only has some information about
the possible content of the screen. Pornography detection is
an example of a problem that needs to be addressed in the
generalization scenario. We discuss it
in more detail here
because of its societal relevance, cf. the issue of people looking
at porn on their devices on an airplane [21], [22].
For pornography detection, the attack goal is to determine
whether or not a phone display pornography without a direct
line of sight to the phone. Here, we assume, it is not possible
for the attacker to have complete information in advance about
all possible images displayed on the phone. Even if it is possi-
ble to access a complete database of all pornographic images, it
is not possible to know which non-pornographic images will be
displayed. To mount a screen gleaning attack in this case, we
must collect representative training data of the different types
of phones we expect, similarly to the discrimination case, and
different levels of favorability for antenna positioning. We also,
however, must collect representative data of all the different
types of pornographic and non-pornographic images that could
be relevant to the problem. The data collection task is clearly
not trivial. However, this type of scenario is clearly important,
so we recommend that future work on screen gleaning focuses
not only on discrimination scenarios (as with the security
codes) but also on more general classiﬁcation scenarios (as
with pornography detection).
We have based our proposed testbed on a test used for
visual acuity, and not speciﬁcally for reading. We have made
sure that our testbed is not limited to letters and numbers,
since we hope that, moving forward, the testbed will be useful
for testing screen gleaning in classiﬁcation scenarios involving
generalization and reconstruction. However, assessing the true
capacity of our testbed will require validation tests in addition
to those carried out here.
IX. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In this paper, we have introduced screen gleaning, a new
TEMPEST attack that uses an antenna and software-deﬁned
radio (SDR) to capture an electromagnetic side channel, i.e.,
emanations leaking from a mobile phone. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the new attack on three different phones with
an example of the recovery of a security code sent in a text
message by using machine learning techniques, as the message
is not comprehensible to the human eye.
In addition, we propose a testbed that provides a standard
setup in which screen gleaning can be tested further with
different attacker models. Finally, we provide ideas for possible
countermeasures for the screen gleaning threat and discuss
their potential.
Future work will involve testing increasingly sophisticated
attacker models that can be built by extending the ﬁve dimen-
sions of the parameterized model that we propose as part of our
testbed framework. As already mentioned, such an extension
will involve moving to more sophisticated attack hardware,
as hardware continues to develop. We have already identiﬁed
special electromagnetic near-ﬁeld scanners [1], which are
basically arrays of loop antennas that allow the attacker to
identify the ‘hot spot’ of the device. The attacker is then able
to aim the antenna at this particular spot. These near-ﬁeld
scanners also identify all resonating frequencies within a band
of 15 kHz to 80 GHz. These frequencies could then be used for
the design of antennas that extend the setup such that attacks
on greater distance can be performed.
Further, we will consider a wider range of other devices,
including other screens from devices like tablets, laptops and
smart displays (such as Google Nest Hub). For example, the
work of Enev et al. [24] suggests that our conclusion should
remain valid for most of the screens, including TV screens.
Finally, we are interested in moving from discrimination
scenarios to generalization scenarios, and ﬁnally to reconstruc-
tion scenarios. In other words, content that the attack recovers
from the phone will become increasingly unpredictable, and
increasingly challenging. The testbed we presented here has
the potential to be further developed to also cover the full
range of possible scenarios.
