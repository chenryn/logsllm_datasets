### Generalization Scenario in Classification

In the context of classification, we define a scenario called the *generalization scenario*, where the attacker has only partial information about the possible content displayed on a screen. A pertinent example of this scenario is the detection of pornography, which we will discuss in detail due to its societal relevance, such as the issue of individuals viewing pornographic material on their devices in public spaces, like airplanes [21], [22].

#### Pornography Detection

For the task of pornography detection, the primary goal of the attacker is to determine whether a phone is displaying pornographic content without having a direct line of sight to the screen. In this scenario, we assume that the attacker does not have complete information about all possible images that could be displayed on the phone. Even if the attacker has access to a comprehensive database of pornographic images, they cannot predict which non-pornographic images will be shown.

To execute a screen gleaning attack under these conditions, the attacker must collect representative training data for various types of phones and different levels of antenna positioning, similar to the discrimination case. Additionally, the attacker needs to gather a diverse set of both pornographic and non-pornographic images relevant to the problem. The data collection process is non-trivial but essential for the success of the attack. This type of scenario is significant, and we recommend that future research on screen gleaning should focus not only on discrimination scenarios (e.g., security codes) but also on more general classification scenarios (e.g., pornography detection).

### Testbed Design

Our proposed testbed is based on a visual acuity test rather than a reading-specific test. We have ensured that the testbed is not limited to letters and numbers, as we aim for it to be useful for testing screen gleaning in classification scenarios involving generalization and reconstruction. However, a thorough assessment of the testbed's capabilities will require additional validation tests beyond those conducted in this study.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we introduced *screen gleaning*, a new TEMPEST attack that uses an antenna and software-defined radio (SDR) to capture electromagnetic side channels emanating from mobile phones. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this attack on three different phones by recovering a security code sent via text message using machine learning techniques, even though the message was not comprehensible to the human eye.

We also proposed a testbed that provides a standardized setup for further testing of screen gleaning with different attacker models. Additionally, we discussed potential countermeasures for the screen gleaning threat and their feasibility.

Future work will involve testing increasingly sophisticated attacker models by extending the five dimensions of the parameterized model in our testbed framework. This will include the use of advanced hardware, such as special electromagnetic near-field scanners [1], which are arrays of loop antennas that can identify the 'hot spot' of a device. These scanners can also detect resonating frequencies within a range of 15 kHz to 80 GHz, which can be used to design antennas for long-distance attacks.

We will also consider a wider range of devices, including tablets, laptops, and smart displays (e.g., Google Nest Hub). The work of Enev et al. [24] suggests that our conclusions should remain valid for most screens, including TV screens.

Finally, we are interested in moving from discrimination scenarios to generalization and, ultimately, to reconstruction scenarios. This means the content recovered from the phone will become increasingly unpredictable and challenging. The testbed presented here has the potential to be further developed to cover the full range of possible scenarios.
