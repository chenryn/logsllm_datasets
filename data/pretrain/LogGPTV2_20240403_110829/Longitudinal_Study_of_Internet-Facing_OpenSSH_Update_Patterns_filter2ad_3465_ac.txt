that almost all OpenSSH servers are aﬀected by at least one CVE throughout
the time of our measurement, saving a small percentage that quickly updated in
late 2016. Given that not all CVEs received a backported patch in Ubuntu, this
result is perhaps inevitable, but it is alarming nonetheless.
To account for this, we construct additional measures that focus only on the
20 CVEs which have an associated Ubuntu backport. Figure 5b again plots the
percentage of Ubuntu OpenSSH servers that aﬀected by one or more vulnera-
bilities with an available backport patch. The percentages here are a bit better,
falling to around 60% of hosts vulnerable to at least one CVE before new vul-

nerabilities are published, rendering all hosts vulnerable until a backport can be
issued. Note that for two years in 2016 to 2018 new CVEs were consistently pub-
lished before backports to the older CVEs were disseminated. The largest reason
for this is that several CVEs were released in 2016 which did not receive a patch
until 2018, so in the meantime, every LTS version of Ubuntu that was stuck on
the upstream OpenSSH version without a security backport was vulnerable. At
that point, the only way to not be vulnerable to those CVEs would be to install
a ﬁxed upstream version of OpenSSH directly. From the above plots, we can see
that no matter how quickly one applies security backports, there is still a chance
that the server is vulnerable to at least one CVE.
One could argue that the measurements in the previous graphs are “unfair”
to system administrators because their servers will remain vulnerable even if
they follow best practice and apply security patches as soon as the backports
are published. To distinguish between those making a best eﬀort and those sim-
ply not applying available security patches, Fig. 7a instead plots the percentage
of machines which have not applied all available CVE-related backport patches.
This can be interpreted as the fraction of machines responsible to patch a vul-
nerability that have not done so.
Here, the ﬁndings are better, but still quite discouraging. The green dashed
vertical lines here indicate when the backport patch is published. Hence, when
a new patch is published, the percentage who can apply the patch but have
not jumps to 100, before rapidly diminishing. We can see that during periods
when relatively few backports are issued, the population can catch up, with the
unpatched share falling to nearly 20% at one point in early 2018. However, we
can also see that in other cases, when there are multiple backports issued in
a row, the servers cannot keep up with applying all of the patches. Hence, an
increasing frequency of distributing backports can in fact make it harder for
systems to maintain security.

We utilize the previous method for distinguishing cloud providers from the
remainder of the Internet for Figs. 6a, 6b, and 7b. Once again, machines running
on one of the three main cloud providers are generally patched faster than the
remainder of the Internet. While all perform better, a greater percentage of
machines on Google Cloud is consistently patched and not vulnerable to CVEs.
We also note that where the cloud providers do best is in rapidly applying
backports when they become available. They do not appear to upgrade systems
by applying upstream patches, which is shown in the similarly poor performance
in Fig. 6a. Even when hosted in the cloud, most machines are vulnerable to at
least one vulnerability most of the time.

5 Limitations
One limitation of our work is that we narrow our focus to OpenSSH security
backports on Ubuntu in order to obtain a reliable views of update level. This
leaves a large percentage of IP addresses with unknown software update levels
due to either using a diﬀerent operating system or Linux distribution.
An additional limitation is the reliability of using of cloud IP address map-
pings gathered in 2021 on historical data dating to late 2015. As more servers
move to cloud providers, those providers may have needed to acquire more IPv4
addresses over the years, causing the IP mappings to not be constant over time.
We attempt to account for this by comparing the cloud IP mappings to 10
historical snapshots of MaxMind’s GeoIP dataset [4] spanning from July 2015
to January 2020 at roughly six month intervals. For each Censys snapshot date,
the nearest GeoIP mapping is compared to the given cloud provider’s announced
mapping from 2021. For example, with Amazon EC2, we verify that “amazon”
is in the GeoIP mapping. A similar pattern is followed for Google and Microsoft.
IP addresses that conﬂict with the organizations listed in the nearest GeoIP
mapping are not counted in our ﬁgures as either a cloud provider or with the
remaining Internet. For Azure and Google Cloud, no IP addresses are omitted
due to the lack of conﬂicting mappings, but an average of 3.6% (ranging from
1% to 5%) of Amazon EC2 IP addresses are ﬁltered at each snapshot.
6 Related Work
In 2015, Durumeric et al. [12] released Censys, which builds upon their work on
fast Internet scanning with Zmap in [14]. Censys scans the Internet using Zmap
and Zgrab and stores the information in a database. The Internet-wide scan
data can be queried by researchers through either their web frontend or through
Google BigQuery [1]. Historical Censys data can be queried as well from Google
BigQuery. We utilize Censys extensively for this work through researcher access
on Google BigQuery.
The empirical measurement of security patches and vulnerabilities is highly
relevant to our work. Durumeric et al. [13] follow the release and subsequent
patching of the Heartbleed vulnerability. Li and Paxson [15] analyzed thousands
of security patches in the National Vulnerability Database [8]. An interesting
ﬁnding is the diﬀerence in the time from when a CVE ID is publicly disclosed
and when it appears in the NVD database. This disparity helps explain how a
Ubuntu backport can ﬁx a vulnerability that was not “published” until later (see
Fig. 2).
O’Hare [17] utilizes Censys and Shodan to identify vulnerabilities on Internet-
wide scans. The possibility of backporting security patches to ﬁx CVEs is men-
tioned, but it does not seem that steps were taken to account for this. Demir et
al. [11] analyze 5.6M websites and discussed the update behavior of many types
of HTTP(S)-related software (port 80 and 443) and libraries. It also discusses the
implications of CVSS scores to updates. It does not appear to consider security
backports of server software, which is a focus of our study.
Longitudinal Study of Internet-Facing OpenSSH Update Patterns
687
Several researchers have used surveys and interviews to better understand
the update process of system administrators, which is relevant to our work in
that it can provide explanations for why software updates are applied or not.
Li et al. [16] conducted over 100 surveys and 17 qualitative interviews with
system administrators and outline what they found to be the 5 stages of the
system administrator update process. Similarly, Tiefenau et al. [18] conducted 7
qualitative interviews and 67 online surveys. Both Li et al. and Tiefenau et al.
discuss the obstacles that delay or prevent system administrators from apply-
ing updates. They also demonstrate the variance in how system administrators
approach updates. While most agree on the necessity of timely updates for the
sake of security, a minority did not.
7 Concluding Remarks
Despite its importance for cybersecurity, measuring the extent to which software
is up-to-date at Internet scale has not often been attempted. One reason why
is that it is often hard to construct an accurate picture with external measure-
ments. In this paper, we have demonstrated that simple approaches to measur-
ing outdatedness based on version information appearing in publicly observable
banners often fall short. Instead, we have shown that by focusing on the special
cases where we can observe the presence of backports, we can construct a more
accurate global measurement for the case of the 4 million-plus servers running
OpenSSH on Ubuntu Linux.
We ﬁnd that these backports do in fact trigger the application of security
patches for a signiﬁcant fraction of the population, much more than vulnera-
bility announcements or updates directly from the software developer. We also
observe that when backports are not created, these vulnerabilities tend to remain
unﬁxed for most of the population. Moreover, the frequency of introducing new
vulnerabilities has ensured that most servers remain vulnerable most of the time.
While we have also presented evidence that cloud providers do a better job, it
is not enough to keep hosts running on those platforms from being consistently
laden with unpatched vulnerabilities.
