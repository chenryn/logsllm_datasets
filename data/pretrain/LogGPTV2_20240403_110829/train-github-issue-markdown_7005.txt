**Current behavior**
The `canLoad` guard is called with the `Route` as the only argument.
**Expected/desired behavior**
The `RouterStateSnapshot` of the future state is provided so the URL can be
stored. The use case would be redirecting the user to a login page, then
returning to the previously attempted URL after logging in.
**Reproduction of the problem**  
If the current behavior is a bug or you can illustrate your feature request
better with an example, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible
