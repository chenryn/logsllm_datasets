User:  How to prevent SQL injection attacks when using JavaScript in your web application?
Assistant: The main way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use parameterized queries. Parameter query is to temporarily replace variables in the SQL statement with placeholders (such as "?"), and then pass the variable values into the query as parameters, thereby avoiding possible SQL injection attacks. For example, parameterized queries can be implemented using prepared statements in JavaScript. Additionally, user input can be validated and filtered on the backend to prevent malicious input. For example, validating that input conforms to the required format and filtering out input that may contain dangerous characters. ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools can also be used to help prevent SQL injection attacks. ORM can automatically generate SQL statements, thus avoiding the risk of manually writing SQL statements. Finally, updating and maintaining the security of the database is also a necessary measure to prevent SQL injection attacks. Make sure to update all systems and libraries, fix known vulnerabilities, and implement appropriate security measures such as access controls and encryption.
