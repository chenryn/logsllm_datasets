To run a Jupyter Notebook on your Ubuntu VM, which you have set up using Vagrant, and access it from your host machine (Windows), follow these steps:

1. **Start the Jupyter Notebook with the correct IP address:**
   By default, Jupyter Notebook binds to `localhost` (127.0.0.1), which is not accessible from the host machine. To make it accessible, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`, which means it will listen on all available network interfaces.

   ```bash
   $ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8004 --ip 0.0.0.0
   ```

   This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and bind it to all network interfaces, making it accessible from your host machine.

2. **Identify the IP address of your VM:**
   You need to find the IP address of your VM that is visible to the host machine. You can do this by running the following command in the VM:

   ```bash
   $ ifconfig
   ```

   Look for the IP address associated with the network interface that is connected to the host. For example, it might be `192.168.56.101` (this is just an example; your actual IP address may differ).

3. **Access the Jupyter Notebook from the host machine:**
   Once you have the IP address, you can access the Jupyter Notebook from your host machine by opening a web browser and navigating to:

   ```
   http://<VM-IP-Address>:8004
   ```

   For example, if the IP address of your VM is `192.168.56.101`, you would navigate to:

   ```
   http://192.168.56.101:8004
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter a token, which is provided in the terminal output when you start the Jupyter Notebook. The terminal output will look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   [I 18:26:10.152 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/vagrant/path/to/jupyter/notebook/directory
   [I 18:26:10.153 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
   [I 18:26:10.154 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://0.0.0.0:8004/
   [I 18:26:10.154 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
   [I 18:26:10.155 NotebookApp] Or copy and paste this URL:
   [I 18:26:10.155 NotebookApp]     http://0.0.0.0:8004/?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

   Copy the URL and paste it into your browser on the host machine, replacing `0.0.0.0` with the actual IP address of your VM.

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that the Vagrant configuration file (`Vagrantfile`) has the correct network settings to allow communication between the host and the VM. For example, you might use a `private_network` configuration to assign a static IP address to the VM.
- If you are using NAT mode, ensure that port forwarding is configured correctly in the Vagrantfile or in the virtualization software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) settings.

By following these steps, you should be able to run Jupyter Notebook on your Ubuntu VM and access it from your Windows host machine.
