Introduction
NetRipper is a post exploitation tool targeting Windows systems which
uses API hooking in order to intercept network traffic and encryption related
functions from a low privileged user, being able to capture both plain-text
traffic and encrypted traffic before encryption/after decryption.
When it is useful
Internal penetration test

Hi,
The new password is “Defcon23”.
Thanks!

Implementation details
Data extraction
Unencrypted data is saved locally
API Hooking
Specific functions are intercepted
Reflective DLL Injection
The DLL is injected into target processes
Classic DLL Injection
Disadvantages:
DLL must be written on disk
DLL is listed in the process modules
How it works:
1. Open the remote process
2. Write DLL full path location in process memory
3. Call LoadLibrary() to load the DLL
Reflective DLL Injection
Stephen Fewer [Harmony Security]
How it works:
1. DLL contents are copied from memory to target process memory
2. An exported function is called ( ReflectiveLoader() )
3. The function correctly loads the DLL into memory
Advantages:
 DLL does not touch the disk (antivirus bypass)
 DLL is not listed in the process modules (stealth)
Detailed Reflective DLL Injection [1]
Load the DLL contents into remote process:
Detailed Reflective DLL Injection [2.1]
Find the DLL image base (like LoadLibrary):
Detailed Reflective DLL Injection [2.2]
Find useful functions:
LoadLibraryA, GetProcAddress, VirtualAlloc, NtFlushInstructionCache
Detailed Reflective DLL Injection [2.3]
Load DLL headers and sections:
Detailed Reflective DLL Injection [2.4]
Process imports and load additional DLLs:
Detailed Reflective DLL Injection [2.5]
Process image relocations:
Detailed Reflective DLL Injection [2.6]
Call entrypoint (DllMain):
Outlook.exe
user32.dll
ncrypt.dll

API Hooking
1. Find function address
2. Place a “call” instruction
3. Call a generic hook function instead
4. Restore original bytes
5. Call a callback function
6. Call original function
7. Save network traffic data
8. Restore hook
API Hooking
