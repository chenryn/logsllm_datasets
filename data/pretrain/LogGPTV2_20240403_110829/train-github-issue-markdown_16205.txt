**Current behavior**  
When using a parametrized route which targets a component, only this component
can access those parameters.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
It might be necessary to read the parameters in other components.
**Reproduction of the problem**  
If the current behavior is a bug or you can illustrate your feature request
better with an example, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible
a minimal demo of the problem via https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use
this template as a starting point:
http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).  
Consider the following route configuration
    export const routes: RouterConfig = [
     { path: 'confirmation/:hashID', component: ConfirmationComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] },
    ];
Consider the following code as part of the ConfirmationComponent
    this.activatedRoute.params.subscribe(params => {
                var hashID = params['hashID'];
            },
If I use the above code in any other component, hashID won't be available. It
is necessary to read location.path() and extract the hashID value.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Although I understand that the targeted component it the
ConfirmationComponent, sometimes other components might need to have access to
the parameters explicitly written in the URL.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
