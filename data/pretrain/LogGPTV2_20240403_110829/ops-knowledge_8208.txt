User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Find MAC addresses in /proc or somewhere despite bonding device? Is there a way to get the original MAC addresses for eth0 and eth1?

A large array of servers have bonding interfaces managing backup switch connections and one is misbehaving. With bond0 active both MAC addresses are replaced and reported identically by ifconfig.

I want to search the server array for a MAC address I found in a Cisco device.

I would use dmesg(1) or /var/log/messages, but they have been rolled over for  hundreds of days for most of the array.

Assistant: I'm still searching for a more "official" explanation, but according to this blog, the file /proc/net/bonding/${bonding name} will provide the actual mac address for each NIC in the bond (eth0, eth1, etc..), so that might be more useful.

Hope this will help!
