### Law Distribution and Implications for Server Resource Provisioning in Online Games

The law distribution, while interesting, has an unfortunate implication for the provisioning of server resources for online games. Specifically, it necessitates that hosts plan for several orders of magnitude of change in popularity, and consequently, in resource requirements, in either direction. This suggests that on-demand infrastructure can significantly reduce costs by allowing more flexible and responsive resource allocation.

### Weekly Player Load Variations

To illustrate the weekly variations in player load, we present data from a four-week period. The figures below show the number of players over the days of the week for four consecutive weeks. The data reveals significant fluctuations, particularly during weekends, which are often characterized by higher player numbers.

**Figure 1: Players per Day Over Four Weeks**
- **Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4**
- **Days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday**

### Modeling Weekly Load Variations

The distribution fitting of load variations indicates that it is feasible to model week-to-week load changes using standard distributions. We are currently exploring the feasibility of online parameter estimation for this model to aid in resource provisioning.

### Long-Term Fluctuations in Game Workloads

While daily and weekly cycles in server load are clear, our trace allows us to examine longer-term trends. We analyzed the trends of three games of similar popularity and the most popular game, Half-Life, over a period of just over two years. The trend was computed as the moving average of the data with a one-week window size.

**Figure 2: Trends of Respective Games**
- **Games: Half-Life, America’s Army, Battlefield 1942, Neverwinter Nights**
- **Time Period: Just over two years**

The underlying trend does not reveal periodicities on a monthly timescale, and the limits of our trace prevent strong conclusions about annual cycles. There are instances where the games appear synchronized, but the concurrent peaks or valleys are not necessarily predictable. For example, all games experience a drop during the unpredictable weeks of the Sobig virus [27].

### Potential for Multiplexing Gain

With the move toward hosted game services and on-demand computing infrastructure, there is growing interest in reducing the cost of running game servers by dynamically sharing resources across multiple games and applications. We explore two scenarios: hosting multiple games on the same servers and hosting websites along with game servers. Additionally, we study the usage behavior of a content-distribution network for supporting games.

- **Games: America’s Army, Battlefield 1942, Half-Life, Neverwinter Nights**

### Synchronization of Game Workloads

There are two ways to multiplex games:
1. **Static Assignment:** Assign physical servers to particular games based on their popularity.
2. **Dynamic Re-allocation:** Re-allocate servers based on instantaneous demand for a particular game.

To investigate the extent to which different games can be multiplexed, we examined the aggregate player populations of four popular games (FPS games: Half-Life, Battlefield 1942, and America’s Army; MMORPG: Neverwinter Nights) over a one-week period. The data was normalized by the mean population for each game during the week.

**Table 1: Mean Player Populations for Week of May 23, 2004**
- **Games: Half-Life, America’s Army, Battlefield 1942, Neverwinter Nights**
- **Average Number of Players: 80324, 5791, 5402, 4579**

**Figure 4: Normalized Player Loads for Four Games During One Week**
- **Games: Half-Life, America’s Army, Battlefield 1942, Neverwinter Nights**
- **Time Period: Sunday May 23, 2004 to Saturday May 29, 2004**

Player populations fluctuate significantly, with lows close to half of the mean and peaks close to twice the mean. Populations across games have peaks in close proximity, making it difficult to achieve significant statistical multiplexing gain between different games.

### Web Server and Game Workload Synchronization

While it is challenging to obtain statistical multiplexing gain between different games, on-demand computing infrastructure could still be useful for multiplexing between other applications such as web servers. We obtained web server logs for three commercial sites: a North American cereal manufacturer, a North American credit card company, and an international beverage manufacturer.

**Table 2: Web Site Logs for Week of August 13, 2001**
- **Sites: North American Cereal Manufacturer, North American Credit Card Company, International Beverage Manufacturer**
- **Data: Total Requests, Content Transferred, Geographically Resolvable**

**Figure 5: Aggregate Normalized Load Between Half-Life and Commercial Web Sites**
- **Sites: North American Cereal Manufacturer, North American Credit Card Company, International Beverage Manufacturer**
- **Time Period: Week of August 13, 2001**

Workloads for web and online games share similar daily periodic peaks. Half-Life shows less variance than North American websites but similar variance to the international beverage manufacturer website. Applications and web sites with global usage patterns are more consistently busy and have less daily variance.

### Geographic Patterns in Game and Web Server Loads

Globally distributed, on-demand computing infrastructure can shift resources geographically close to where the demand is coming from. We examined a one-week period of cs.mshmro.com and used a commercial geographic IP address mapping tool to resolve the location of each player connecting.

**Table 3: Connection Data for cs.mshmro.com for Week of May 23, 2004**
- **Data: Total Connections, Geographically Resolvable, From North America, From Asia, From Europe, From Other Continents**

**Figure 6: Per-Continent, Normalized Load of the Game and Web Server for North America and Europe**
- **Time Period: Sunday May 23, 2004 to Saturday May 29, 2004**

The per-continent load fluctuations and variance are similar to those found in regional web sites. Usage of both applications is highly synchronized when broken down into geographic regions, limiting the benefits of geographically distributed, on-demand computing infrastructure for interactive applications.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for resource provisioning and multiplexing in online gaming and web server environments.
