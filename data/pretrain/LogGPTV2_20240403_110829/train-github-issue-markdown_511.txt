  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I should be able to use `withData` from the with-apollo example and
`translate` from react-i18next HoCs together.
## Current Behavior
I've been using Apollo as per the with-apollo example quite happily for some
time and I'm now trying to integrate with-i18n. Unfortunately I think there
may be issues with combining the two approaches. I'm receiving the following
error:
    Cannot read property 'options' of undefined
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined
    ...
    at new I18n node_modules/react-i18next/dist/commonjs/I18n.js:56:20
It seems i18n isn't being initialised correctly (hence options of undefined
(the i18n instance)), or is being overridden, perhaps because of the usage of
`getInitialProps` in `withData.js`?
Has anyone managed to get Next.JS, Apollo and i18n working together? Any
working examples?
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Follow the steps to setup with-apollo example and with-i18n
  2. Create a page which is wrapped in `translate` from react-i18next and `withData` from the with-apollo example.
  3. See error.
## Context
I'm trying to integrate react-i18next into my current next/apollo setup.
