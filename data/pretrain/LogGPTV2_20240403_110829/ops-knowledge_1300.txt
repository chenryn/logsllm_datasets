User: For great help from stackoverflow, the development for the Mac version of my program is done. 
Now I need to deploy my program, and I was wondering if there is any way to "hide" my running Python code (it also runs .so library and it seems it makes a dock item to appear).
The program is supposed to be running in the background and it would be great if I can hide any terminal or dock items. In Windows or linux, it was easy, but I am still not that used to Mac and could not figure out how to do this.
Thank you,
Joon
Assistant: have you tried using the nohup? lets say you have a launch script to start your program:
launch.sh:
nohup your_program & 
exit
