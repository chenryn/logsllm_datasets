User: I have edited the contents of my batch file in a python program however when I try to execute the .bat in python it doesn't follow the instructions. It opens the console and then closes but nothing happens. Instead I am looking at an alternative route- automatically running after the code has been saved or changed. 
The reason I need it to run is because it updates an mp3, so if it's not running properly the mp3 doesn't change. I think one of the reasons may be down to not being able to run as administrator in python. I did create a shortcut and set it to run as admin every time but python wouldn't allow the .ink file for subprocess.Popen() and os.system()
Assistant: For running the the batch file again after it has been edited or modified, you can write a script. That script can be executed using daemon services or launchd in mac os x.
