I understand that you're encountering difficulties installing `appscript` on OS X 10.6.3 with Python 2.6.1. When you attempt to install it using the command:

```bash
sudo easy_install appscript
```

you receive an error message stating, "unable to execute gcc-4.2: No such file or directory." Even after setting the `CC` environment variable to point to a valid `gcc-4.2` executable (e.g., `/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2`), `easy_install` still fails.

### Possible Solution:
The issue may be related to the location and availability of the necessary compilers. To resolve this, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Reinstall Xcode with UNIX Development Tools:**
   - Re-run the Xcode installer.
   - During the installation process, ensure that the "UNIX Development" option is checked. This will install the necessary compilers in both `/usr/bin` and `/Developer`.

2. **Verify Compiler Installation:**
   - After reinstallation, verify that the `gcc-4.2` compiler is available by running:
     ```bash
     which gcc-4.2
     ```
   - If the path is not displayed, you may need to add the appropriate directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

3. **Retry Installation:**
   - Once the compilers are correctly installed, try running the `easy_install` command again:
     ```bash
     sudo easy_install appscript
     ```

If you continue to experience issues, please provide any additional error messages for further troubleshooting.

### Additional Tips for New OS X Users:
- **Xcode Command Line Tools:**
  - In more recent versions of macOS, you can also install the Xcode Command Line Tools separately using:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  - This might be a more straightforward approach if you don't need the full Xcode IDE.

- **Homebrew:**
  - Consider using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to simplify the installation of development tools and libraries. You can install Homebrew by following the instructions on their website: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully install `appscript` on your system.
