User: I am having some trouble getting appscript installed on OS/X 10.6.3 / Python 2.6.1. When I issue
sudo easy_install appscript
I get "unable to execute gcc-4.2: No such file or directory".  Even when I do export CC=/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 (a valid gcc-4.2 executable), easy_install barks.
What could be the issue?
Disclaimer: OS/X newbie at the helm...
Assistant: Rerun the Xcode installer and check "UNIX Development" - it will put compilers in /usr/bin in addition to /Developer.
