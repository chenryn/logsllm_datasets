React version: 16
## Steps To Reproduce
Open the codepen demo.
  1. Focus the outside div by clicking the black area
  2. Focus inner yellow div by either pressing arrow keys or clicking or tab
## The current behavior
When using arrow keys to change focus, `render` is called once **only**.  
When using click or tab to change focus, `render` is called **twice**.
## The expected behavior
`render` should be called the same times under 2 scenarios.
