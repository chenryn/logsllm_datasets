# Comparison of 1-Multihoming, k-Overlays, and k-Multihoming

## Benefits of k-Overlays
### Relative RTTs and Throughput

**Figure 5: Benefits of k-Overlays**
- **(a) Relative RTTs**: The Round-Trip Time (RTT) performance of 1-multihoming relative to k-overlays is shown. For \( k = 3 \), k-overlay routing achieves 25–80% better RTT performance than 1-multihoming. For \( k \geq 3 \), the RTT performance from k-overlay routing is about 5–20% better than that from 1-overlay routing.
- **(b) Throughput (Pessimistic Estimate)**: The throughput performance of k-overlays relative to 1-multihoming is shown. For \( k = 3 \), k-overlay routing provides 20–55% better throughput than 1-multihoming and about 10–25% better than 1-overlay routing. The benefits beyond \( k = 3 \) are marginal across most cities for both RTT and throughput.

**Summary:**
- Both k-multihoming and k-overlay routing offer significantly better performance than 1-multihoming in terms of RTT and throughput.
- For \( k \geq 3 \), k-overlay routing achieves 5–20% better RTT and 10–25% better throughput compared to 1-overlay routing.

## k-Multihoming vs. 1-Overlays
### Performance Comparison

**Figure 6: Multihoming vs. 1-Overlays**
- **(a) Relative RTTs**: The RTT performance of k-multihoming relative to 1-overlays is shown. For \( k = 3 \), the relative performance advantage of 1-overlays is less than 5% in nearly all cities. In some cities, such as the Bay Area and Chicago, 3-multihoming is marginally better than overlay routing. As the number of ISPs increases, multihoming provides shorter round-trip times than overlays in many cities, with the exception of Seattle.
- **(b) Throughput (Pessimistic Estimate)**: The throughput performance of 1-overlays relative to k-multihoming is shown. For \( k \geq 3 \), multihoming provides 2–12% better throughput than 1-overlays across all cities.

**Summary:**
- The performance advantages of 1-overlays are vastly reduced or eliminated when the end-point is allowed greater flexibility in the choice of BGP paths via multihoming route control.

## k-Multihoming vs. k-Overlays
### Performance Benefits

**Figure 7: Round-Trip Time Improvement**
- **(a) Relative RTTs**: The improvement in RTT for k-multihoming relative to k-overlays is shown. For \( k = 3 \), overlays provide 5–15% better RTT performance than the best multihoming solution in most cities. In a few cities, such as Seattle and the Bay Area, the benefit is greater. The performance gap between multihoming and overlays is less significant for \( k \geq 4 \).
- **(b) Distribution of Overlay Hops**: The distribution of the number of overlay hops in the paths selected by 3-overlay routing optimized for RTT is shown. The best overlay path coincides with the best 3-multihoming BGP path in 64% of the cases, on average across all cities. This fraction is higher than the 54% observed for 1-overlay routing. With more ISPs to choose from, overlay routing selects a higher fraction of direct BGP paths.

**Summary:**
- The performance advantages of k-overlays over k-multihoming are significant for \( k = 3 \), but the gap narrows as \( k \) increases.
- Overlay routing tends to select more direct BGP paths, leading to better RTT performance in certain scenarios.

This structured and detailed comparison provides a clear and professional overview of the performance benefits and trade-offs between 1-multihoming, k-overlays, and k-multihoming.
