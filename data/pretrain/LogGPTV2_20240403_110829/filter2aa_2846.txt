### Overview
This presentation will cover methods to determine if you are a victim of spying, including:
- Video surveillance
- Tailing
- Audio eavesdropping
- Devices embedded in your computer, tablet, or smartphone

### Why You Should Care
- **Government Intrusions:** The erosion of constitutional rights is well-documented.
- **Local Governments:** Smaller entities may also engage in surveillance.
- **Competitors:** Business rivals might use surveillance for an unfair advantage.
- **Stalkers and Adversaries:** Individuals who have personal vendettas.

## Video Surveillance

### Common Flaw in Night Vision Cameras
All night vision cameras share a common flaw that can be detected with any digital camera.

### Detecting Cameras
- **Using a Phone:** A simple method to find hidden cameras.
- **Other IR Detection Methods:**
  - **Free Method:** Use an Android tablet or smartphone (ad hoc networks).
  - **Inexpensive Method:** Utilize a BeagleBone-based system.
  - **Simple Method:** Employ `Airodump-ng`.
  - **Slightly More Sophisticated Method:** Use Python.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from scapy.all import *
import os, sys, time, operator

interface = "mon0"
clientsIKnow = {}

def sniffClientStrength(p):
    if p.haslayer(RadioTap) and p.haslayer(Dot11):
        try:
            sigStrength = int(-(256 - ord(p.notdecoded[-4:-3])))
            if str(p.addr2) not in clientsIKnow.keys():
                clientsIKnow[str(p.addr2)] = sigStrength
            else:
                if sigStrength > clientsIKnow[str(p.addr2)]:
                    clientsIKnow[str(p.addr2)] = sigStrength
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            sys.exit(1)
        except:
            pass

def main():
    os.system('clear')
    try:
        while True:
            sniff(iface=interface, prn=sniffClientStrength, timeout=2)
            if clientsIKnow:
                sorted_list = sorted(clientsIKnow.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
                for item in sorted_list:
                    print(item[0], item[1])
            time.sleep(1)
            os.system('clear')
            clientsIKnow.clear()
            sorted_list = []
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### More Sophisticated Detection
- **Moderately Expensive Method:** Use a Linear Technologies LTC5582 RMS RF power detector.
  - Measure the output on a voltmeter or BeagleBone.
  - Bandpass filters can be used to analyze individual frequency bands.

## Physical Surveillance

### Tailing
- **Common Vehicles Used:**
  - Non-government spies: Bland-colored Honda or Toyota sedans, SUVs.
  - Government spies: Black SUVs, Crown Victorias, and other issued vehicles.
- **General Techniques:**
  - Follow distance: 2 cars behind to a block.
  - Bumper beepers extend follow distance up to 0.5 â€“ 10.0 miles.
  - Tail is considered blown if the subject has 3 suspicious impressions.

### Single Car Tailing
- Closer than multi-car tails.
- More likely to follow traffic laws.
- May use a bumper beeper to relocate the subject if lost.

### Multi-car Tailing
- Generally, all cars are behind the subject.
- Some cars may be on parallel streets, especially in urban areas.
- Tailing vehicles may change positions and occasionally appear to go a different direction only to rejoin later.

### Combating Tailing
- **Look!**
  - Check around your car for trackers.
  - Watch for vehicles that seem to be following you for long distances.
  - Watch for vehicles that go away and then come back.
- **Detect Electronic Devices:**
  - Use the previously described RF detection system without filters.
  - Scan the AM radio band before driving.
- **Active Techniques:**
  - Drag a few traffic lights.
  - Take unusual routes.
  - Drive through residential neighborhoods.
  - Take a few alleys or deserted side streets.
  - Occasionally park for no reason.

### Stakeout Vehicles
- Same vehicles used in tailing may be used.
- Additional vehicles might include SUVs, commercial vans, and pickup trucks with toppers.

### Combating Stationary Surveillance
- **Look!**
  - People in parked vehicles.
  - Construction/utility workers who are around too long or appear to be doing nothing.
  - Commercial vans parked for extended periods.
  - Anyone with a view of all your exits.
- **Active Techniques:**
  - Use binoculars to spy back.
  - Run outside and jump in your car, then run back inside to see if anyone notices.
  - Drive around the block to see if anyone followed you.

## Audio Bugging

### Detecting Active Bugs
- **Free Method:** Analog AM/FM radio might detect some bugs.
- **Inexpensive Method:** USB TV Tuner Software Defined Radio (SDR) can detect signals in 50 MHz - 2 GHz.
- **Moderately Expensive Method:** Broadband amplifier connected to a TV antenna.
- **Expensive Method:** Purchase a commercial detector for around $500.

### Detecting Bugs with a Radio
- Must be an analog radio.
- Scan through the AM/FM bands to hear the audio you are generating.
- Works with only the simplest bugs.

### Detecting Passive Bugs
- Excite the bug with RF in the correct band.
- If close enough and the signal is strong, it can still work with the wrong frequency.
- Detection is the same as for active bugs.

### Exciting the Bug
- **Free Method:** Blast it with 2.4 GHz from your Alfa.
- **Inexpensive Method:** Noisy broadband transmitter attached to a TV antenna.

## Bugs in Computing Devices

### Installation Methods
- Intercepting shipments.
- "Service" professionals.
- Spies in your local IT staff.
- Disgruntled colleagues.

### Detecting Bugs
- **Free Method:** Visual inspection.
  - Bugging devices can be installed externally.
  - Examples: Dalek desktop defender, TARDIS.
  - Check every device connected to your computer, especially USB and network devices.
- **Inexpensive Method:** Current leaks.
  - Modify a universal laptop power supply to detect current leakage.
  - For laptops or phones, remove the battery and measure current with the device "off."
  - For tablets, fully charge the battery and measure the current flow.
  - Small current might indicate an issue with the charging circuit or battery.
  - If the current peaks when you speak or move in view of the camera, there may be a bug.

### Desktop Computers
- **Physical Inspection:** Best method.
- **Current Leakage Detection:** Use a Kill o Watt or similar device.
  - Many computer power supplies leak current, so this is not conclusive.
  - Desktop bugs might only work when the computer is on.

### Passive Bugs
- Excite as described for passive audio bugs.
- Use the same techniques to detect the excited bug.
- This won't detect all passive bugs, such as expensive NSA bugs.

## Summary
- Choose your level of paranoia.
- Even if you aren't paranoid, you can still detect many spying activities at no cost.
- Truly paranoid individuals can still test without financial ruin.
