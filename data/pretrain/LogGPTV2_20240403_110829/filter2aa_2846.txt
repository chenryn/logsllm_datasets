What this talk is about
● Determining if you are a victim of spying
– Video surveillance
– Tailing
– Audio eavesdropping
– Devices embedded in your computer, 
tablet, or smart phone
Why you should care
● Government assault on Constitution is 
well known
● Local governments
● Competitors
● Stalkers
● People who just don't like you
Video surveillance
Common flaw all night vision 
cameras share
Detecting this flaw with any 
digital camera
Finding a camera with a 
phone 
Other Ways to Detect IR
Detecting wireless cameras
Free way: Android tablet or 
smartphone (ad hoc nets)
Inexpensive way: BeagleBone based system
Simple way using Airodump-ng
Slightly more sophisticated with Python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from scapy.all import * 
import os, sys, time, operator
interface = "mon0"
clientsIKnow = { }
def sniffClientStrength(p):
     if p.haslayer(RadioTap) and p.haslayer(Dot11):
        try:
            sigStrength = int(-(256-ord(p.notdecoded[-4:-3])))
            if str(p.addr2) not in clientsIKnow.keys():
                clientsIKnow[str(p.addr2)] = sigStrength
            else:
                if sigStrength > clientsIKnow[str(p.addr2)]:
                    clientsIKnow[str(p.addr2)] = sigStrength
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            sys.exit(1)            
        except:
            pass
def main():
    os.system('clear')
    try:
        while True:
            sniff(iface=interface, prn=sniffClientStrength, timeout=2)
            if clientsIKnow:
                sorted_list = sorted(clientsIKnow.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
                for item in sorted_list:
                    print item[0], item[1]
            time.sleep(1)
            os.system('clear')
            clientsIKnow.clear()
            sorted_list = []
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
More sophisticated Way
Moderately expensive way: 
Detecting signals in licensed 
bands
● Use an Linear Technologies LTC5582 
RMS RF power detector
● Measure LTC5582 output on volt meter 
or BeagleBone or ??
● Bandpass filters can be used to look at 
individual frequency bands
Moderately Expensive Way
Moderately Expensive Way
Physical surveillance
● Tailing
– Common vehicles used
– Standard techniques
● Stakeout
– Common vehicles used
– Standard techniques
Tailing Vehicles
● Non-government spies choose vehicles to blend in
– Probably not the red Ferrari behind you
– Likely vehicles
● Bland colored Honda or Toyota sedan
● Bland colored SUV
● Whatever is commonly seen in the area
● Government spies drive vehicles issued to them
– Black SUV
– Crown Victoria
– Other vehicles too!
General Tailing Techniques
● Follow distance varies from about 2 
cars behind to a block
● Bumper beeper may be used to extend 
follow distance to 0.5 – 10.0 miles
● Tail is generally considered blown if 
subject has 3 suspicious impressions 
Single Car Tailing
● Generally will be closer than multi-car 
tails
● More likely to follow traffic laws
● May use a bumper beeper to help 
relocate the subject if lost
Multi-car Tailing
● In most cases everyone is behind the 
subject
● Some cars may be on parallel streets
– More likely in urban areas
● Tailing vehicles may change relative 
positions
● Vehicles might occasionally appear to 
go a different direction only to rejoin 
later
Combating Tailing
● Look!
– Check around your car for trackers
– Watch for vehicles who seem to be 
behind you for long distances
– Watch for vehicles that go away and 
then come back
Combating Tailing (contd)
● Detect electronic devices
– Use the previously describe RF 
detection system without any 
filters
– Scan the AM radio band on your 
car radio before you go
● Many homemade or privately available 
trackers operate in this frequency band
● If you hear nothing but a strong tone it is 
probably a tracker on your car!
Combating Tailing (contd)
● Active techniques
– Drag a few traffic lights
– Take unusual routes
– Drive through residential neighborhoods
– Take a few alleys or deserted side 
streets
– Occasionally park for no reason 
Stakeout Vehicles
● Same vehicles used in tailing may be 
used
● Additional vehicles might be used
– SUV
– Commercial vans
– Pickup trucks with toppers
Combating Stationary 
Surveillance
● Look!
– People in parked vehicles
– Construction/utility workers who are 
around too long or appear to be 
doing nothing
– Commercial vans parked for 
extended periods
– Anyone with view of all your exits
Combating Stationary 
Surveillance (contd)
● Active techniques
– Get out your binoculars and spy back
– Run outside and jump in your car
● Run back inside and see if anyone 
seems to notice
● Drive around the block and see if anyone 
followed you
Audio bugging
Detecting active bugs
● Free way: analog AM/FM radio might detect 
some bugs
● Inexpensive way: USB TV Tuner Software 
Defined Radio (SDR)
– Can detect signals in 50 MHz - 2 GHz
– Commercial bugs are usually 10 MHz - 8 
GHz
● Moderately expensive way: Broadband amplifier 
connected to TV antenna
● Expensive way: Drop $500 on a commercial 
detector
Detecting bugs with a radio
● Must be analog
● Scan through the AM/FM 
bands to see if you can hear 
the audio you are generating
● Works with only the simplest 
bugs
Detecting passive bugs
● Must try to excite bug with RF in correct 
band
● If you are close enough and the signal 
is strong can still work with wrong 
frequency
● Detection is same as active bugs
Exciting the bug
● Free way: Blast it with 2.4 GHz from 
your Alfa
● Inexpensive way: Noisy broadband 
transmitter attached to TV antenna
Bugs in your computing 
devices
● Bugs can be installed by
– intercepting shipments
– "service" professionals
– spies in your local IT staff
– pissed off guy in your office
Detecting bugs
● Free way: Look!
– Bugging devices can be installed externally
– I described a small dropbox easily hidden 
behind a computer at DC21
– Same dropbox is easily hidden in other 
items on your desk
● Example: Dalek desktop defender
● Example: TARDIS
● Check every device connected to your 
computer especially USB and network
Hiding Places
Bugs may be internal
● Open the case and look for obvious 
signs
● Pictures of NSA devices have been 
leaked
● Inexpensive way: Current leaks
– Bugs need current to run
– Turned off devices shouldn't draw any 
power
A modified universal laptop 
power supply can be used to 
detect this current leakage
●
Modify the power supply to detect current 
●
For laptop or phone remove the battery and measure 
current with device "off"
– Current flow indicates possible bug
●
For tablet fully charge the battery
– Measure the current flow
– Small current might indicate issue with charging circuit 
or battery
– If the current peaks when you speak or move in view of 
the camera there may be a bug 
Laptop Adapter
Laptop Adapter
For a desktop computer
● Physical inspection is best
– Can attempt to detect leakage current 
with Kill o Watt or similar 
● Many computer power supplies leak 
current so this is not conclusive
● Desktop bug might only work when 
computer is on
Passive bugs
● Excite as described for passive audio 
bugs
● Use same techniques as described 
above to detect excited bug 
● Won't detect all passive bugs (such as 
the expensive NSA bugs)
Summary
● Chose your level of paranoia 
● Even if you aren't paranoid you can still 
detect many spying activities at no cost
● Truly paranoid can still test without 
financial ruin
