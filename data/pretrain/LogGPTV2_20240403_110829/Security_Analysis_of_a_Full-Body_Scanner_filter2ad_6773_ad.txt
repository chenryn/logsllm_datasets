As early as 1991, Sandia National Labs recommended the
use of side scans to ﬁnd some contraband:
A metallic object on the side of a person would
blend in with the background and be unob-
served. However, a side scan would provide
an image of the object. There are other means
of addressing this which IRT is considering
presently [22, page 14].
Yet TSA procedures appear to call for only front and back
scans, and the device manual characterizes side scans as
an unusual practice:
The Secure 1000 can conduct scans in four sub-
ject positions, front, rear, left side and right side.
Most users only conduct front and rear scans
in routine operations and reserve the side scans
for special circumstances [35, page 3-7].
Omitting side scans makes it possible to conceal ﬁrearms,
as we discuss in Section 3.1.
Since side scans are necessary for good security, the
device’s design should encourage their use by default. Yet,
if anything, the scanner user interface nudges operators
away from performing side scans. It allows the display
of only two images at a time, making it poorly suited
to taking four scans of a subject. A better design would
either scan from all sides automatically (the Secure 1000
is already sold in a conﬁguration that scans from two sides
without the subject’s turning around) or encourage/require
a four-angle scan.
Adversarial thinking, as usual, is crucial for security.
The Sandia report concludes that both C-4 and Detasheet
plastic explosives are detected by the Secure 1000. At-
tached to their report is an image from one C-4 test
(Figure 9), wherein a 0.95 cm thick C-4 block is no-
ticeable only by edge effects — it is outlined by its own
shadow, while the intensity within the block almost ex-
actly matches the surrounding ﬂesh. This suggests a fail-
ure to think adversarially: since plastic explosives are, by
design, moldable putty, the attacker can simply gradually
thin and taper the edges of the mass, drastically reducing
edge effects and rendering it much less noticeable under
X-ray backscatter imaging. We describe precisely such
an attack in Section 3.3.
The basic problem appears to be that the system, while
well engineered, appears not to have been designed, doc-
umented, or deployed with adaptive attack in mind. For

to narrow data interfaces. The Secure 1000 gets these
principles right in many respects. For example, the PC
software does not have the ability to command the X-ray
tube to a particular height. Instead, it can only command
the tube to return to its start position or to take a scan.
Our main suggestion for improving the Secure 1000’s
cyberphysical security is to remove the ability for the
control board ﬁrmware to override the safety interlocks
(something currently needed only brieﬂy, at scan initial-
ization). As long as this bypass functionality is in place,
the interlocks can serve as safety mechanisms but not as
a defense against software- or ﬁrmware-based attacks.
Published reports about
Keeping details of the machine’s behavior secret
didn’t help . . .
the Se-
cure 1000 have been heavily redacted, omitting even
basic details about the machine’s operation. This did
not stop members of the public from speculating about
ways to circumvent the machine, using only open-source
information. In an incident widely reported in the press,
Jonathan Corbett suggested that ﬁrearms hanging off the
body might be invisible against the dark background [8],
an attack we conﬁrm and reﬁne in Section 3.1. Two
physicists, Leon Kaufman and Joseph Carlson, reverse en-
gineered the Secure 1000’s characteristics from published
scans and concluded that “[i]t is very likely that a large
(15–20 cm in diameter), irregularly-shaped, [one] cm-
thick pancake [of plastic explosive] with beveled edges,
taped to the abdomen, would be invisible to this technol-
ogy” [21], an attack we conﬁrm and reﬁne in Section 3.3.
Keeping basic information about the device secret made
an informed public debate about its use at airports more
difﬁcult, but did not prevent dangerous attacks from being
devised.
. . . but keeping attackers from testing attacks on the
machine might. To a degree that surprised us, our at-
tacks beneﬁted from testing on the device itself. Our ﬁrst
attempts at implementing a new attack strategy were of-
ten visible to the scanner, and reliable concealment was
made possible only by iteration and reﬁnement. It goes
without saying that software-replacement attacks on the
console are practical only if one has a machine to reverse
engineer. As a result, we conclude that, in the case of
the Secure 1000, keeping the machine out of the hands of
would-be attackers may well be an effective strategy for
preventing reliable exploitation, even if the details of the
machine’s operation were disclosed.
The effectiveness of such a strategy depends critically
on the difﬁculty of obtaining access to the machine. In
addition to the device we purchased, at least one other
Secure 1000 was available for sale on eBay for months
after we obtained ours. We do not know whether it sold, or
to whom. Also, front-line security personnel will always
have some level of access to the device at each deployment
Figure 9: Naïve Evaluation — In an evaluation by Sandia Na-
tional Labs, a Secure 1000 prototype successfully detects blocks
of C-4 plastic explosive and Lucite attached to the subject’s
chest. Observe that the detection is based almost entirely on the
X-ray shadow surrounding each rectangular block, which can be
reduced or eliminated by an adaptive adversary through clever
shaping and positioning of contraband. Reproduced from [22].
instance, attaching contraband to the side of the body as
described in Section 3.1 is a straightforward attack that
is enabled by scanning only straight-on rather than from
all angles. However, the operator’s manual shows only
example images where the contraband is clearly at the
front or the back.
The other attacks we describe in Sections 3 and 4,
which allow us to circumvent or weaken the advertised
efﬁcacy, privacy, and security claims, again show that the
system’s designers failed to think adversarially.
Simplicity and modular design are also crucial for se-
curity. The system control board implements simple,
well-deﬁned functionality and communicates with the op-
erator console by means of a simple protocol. We were
unable to compromise the control board by abusing the
communication protocol. This is in contrast to the scanner
console, whose software runs on a general-purpose COTS
operating system.
Simplicity and modular design prevented worse attacks,
but do other AITs reﬂect these design principles? Modern
embedded systems tend towards greater integration, in-
creased software control, and remote network capabilities,
which are anathema to security.
Components should be designed with separation of con-
cerns in mind: each component should be responsible for
controlling one aspect of the machine’s operation. Com-
munication between components should be constrained

installation (including at non-TSA facilities) as they are
responsible for its continued operation. Given these facts,
imposing stricter purchase controls on backscatter X-ray
machines than those currently enacted may not be enough
to keep determined adversaries from accessing, studying,
and experimenting with them.

Cyberphysical devices must be evaluated not only for
their safety but also for their security in the presence of an
adversary [19]. This consideration is especially important
for AITs, which are deployed to security checkpoints. Un-
fortunately, AIT manufacturers and TSA have not, to date,
allowed an unfettered independent assessment of AITs.
Security evaluators retained by a manufacturer or its cus-
tomers may not have an incentive to ﬁnd problems [30].
In the case of a backscatter X-ray AIT speciﬁcally, an
evaluation team may be skilled in physics but lack the ex-
pertise to identify software vulnerabilities, or vice versa.
Ours is the ﬁrst study to consider computer security
aspects of an AIT’s design and operation, and the ﬁrst
truly independent assessment of an AIT’s security, privacy,
and efﬁcacy implications informed by experimentation
with an AIT device.
Efﬁcacy and procedures.
In 1991, soon after its initial
development, the Secure 1000 was evaluated by Sandia
National Laboratories on behalf of IRT Corp., the com-
pany then working to commercialize the device. The
Sandia report [22] assessed the device’s effectiveness in
screening for ﬁrearms, explosives, nuclear materials, and
drugs. The Sandia evaluators do not appear to have con-
sidered adaptive strategies for positioning and shaping
contraband, nor did they consider attacks on the device’s
software. Nevertheless, they observed that side scans
were sometimes necessary to detect ﬁrearms.
More recently, the Department of Homeland Security’s
Ofﬁce of Inspector General released a report reviewing
TSA’s use of the Secure 1000 [10]. This report proposed
improvements in TSA procedures surrounding the ma-
chines but again did not consider adversarial conditions
or software vulnerabilities.
Working only from published descriptions of the de-
vice, researchers have hypothesized that ﬁrearms can be
concealed hanging off the body [8] and that plastic explo-
sives can be caked on the body [21]. We conﬁrm these
attacks are possible in Section 3 and reﬁne them through
access to the device for testing.
Health concerns. The ionizing radiation used by the
Secure 1000 poses at least potential health risks. Stud-
ies performed on behalf of TSA by the Food and Drug
Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiological
Health [5] and by the Johns Hopkins University Applied
Physics Laboratory [18] attempted to quantify the overall
radiation dose delivered by the device. Both studies saw
public release only in heavily redacted form, going so far
as to redact even the effective current of the X-ray tube.
In 2010, Professors at the University of California, San
Francisco wrote an open letter to John P. Holdren, the
Assistant to the President for Science and Technology,
expressing their concern about potential health effects
from the use of backscatter X-ray scanners at airports [40].
The letter writers drew on their radiological expertise, but
did not have access to a Secure 1000 to study. The FDA
published a response disputing the technical claims in the
UCSF letter [28], as did the inventor of the Secure 1000,
Steven W. Smith [43]. Under dispute was not just the
total radiation dose but its distribution through the skin
and body. In independent work concurrent with ours, a
task group of the American Association of Physicists in
Medicine [2] explicitly considered skin dose. The task
group’s measurements are within an order of magnitude
of our own, presented in Appendix A.
7 Conclusion
We obtained a Rapiscan Secure 1000 and evaluated its
effectiveness for people screening. Ours was the ﬁrst
analysis of an AIT that is independent of the device’s
manufacturer and its customers; the ﬁrst to assume an
adaptive adversary; and the ﬁrst to consider software as
well as hardware. By exploiting properties of the Se-
cure 1000’s backscatter X-ray technology, we were able
to conceal knives, ﬁrearms, plastic explosive simulants,
and detonators. We further demonstrated that malicious
software running on the scanner console can manipulate
rendered images to conceal contraband.
Our ﬁndings suggest that the Secure 1000 is ineffective
as a contraband screening solution against an adaptive
adversary who has access to a device to study and to use
for testing and reﬁning attacks. The ﬂaws we identiﬁed
could be partly remediated through changes to procedures:
performing side scans in addition to front and back scans,
and screening subjects with magnetometers as well as
backscatter scanners; but these procedural changes will
lengthen screening times.
Our ﬁndings concerning the Secure 1000 considered as
a cyberphysical device are more mixed. Given physical
access, we were able to replace the software running on
the scanner console, again allowing attackers to smuggle
contraband past the device. On the other hand, we were
unable to compromise the ﬁrmware on the system control
board, a fact we attribute to the separation of concerns
embodied in, and to the simplicity of, the scanner design.
The root cause of many of the issues we describe
seems to be failure of the system designers to think ad-
versarially. That failure extends also to publicly available
evaluations of the Secure 1000’s effectiveness. Addi-
tionally, the secrecy surrounding AITs has sharply lim-

ited the ability of policymakers, experts, and the gen-
eral public to assess the government’s safety and security
claims.
Despite the ﬂaws we identiﬁed, we are not able to cate-
gorically reject TSA’s claim that AITs represent the best
available tradeoff for airport passenger screening. Hard-
ened cockpit doors may mitigate the hijacking threat from
ﬁrearms and knives; what is clearly needed, with or with-
out AITs, is a robust means for detecting explosives. The
millimeter-wave scanners currently deployed to airports
will likely behave differently from the backscatter scanner
we studied. We recommend that those scanners, as well
as any future AITs — whether of the millimeter-wave or
backscatter [34] variety — be subjected to independent,
adversarial testing, and that this testing speciﬁcally con-
sider software security.
