As early as 1991, Sandia National Laboratories recommended the use of side scans to detect certain types of contraband. A metallic object placed on the side of a person can blend into the background and go undetected in a front or back scan. However, a side scan would provide a clear image of the object. Other methods for addressing this issue are currently being considered by IRT [22, page 14].

Despite this, TSA procedures typically call for only front and back scans. The device manual characterizes side scans as an unusual practice:
"The Secure 1000 can conduct scans from four positions: front, rear, left side, and right side. Most users only perform front and rear scans in routine operations, reserving side scans for special circumstances [35, page 3-7]."

Omitting side scans makes it possible to conceal firearms, as discussed in Section 3.1. Since side scans are essential for effective security, the device's design should encourage their use by default. Instead, the scanner's user interface discourages operators from performing side scans. It allows the display of only two images at a time, making it poorly suited for taking four scans of a subject. A better design would either automatically scan from all sides (the Secure 1000 is already available in a configuration that scans from two sides without the subject turning around) or require a four-angle scan.

Adversarial thinking is crucial for security. The Sandia report concludes that both C-4 and Detasheet plastic explosives are detected by the Secure 1000. An image from one C-4 test (Figure 9) shows a 0.95 cm thick C-4 block noticeable only by edge effects—it is outlined by its own shadow, while the intensity within the block almost exactly matches the surrounding flesh. This suggests a failure to think adversarially: since plastic explosives are moldable, an attacker can gradually thin and taper the edges of the mass, drastically reducing edge effects and making it much less noticeable under X-ray backscatter imaging. We describe such an attack in Section 3.3.

The fundamental problem appears to be that the system, while well-engineered, was not designed, documented, or deployed with adaptive attacks in mind. For example, the PC software does not have the ability to command the X-ray tube to a particular height; it can only command the tube to return to its start position or take a scan. Our main suggestion for improving the Secure 1000’s cyber-physical security is to remove the ability for the control board firmware to override the safety interlocks, which is currently needed only briefly during scan initialization. As long as this bypass functionality is in place, the interlocks can serve as safety mechanisms but not as a defense against software- or firmware-based attacks.

Published reports about the Secure 1000 have been heavily redacted, omitting even basic details about the machine’s operation. This did not stop members of the public from speculating about ways to circumvent the machine using open-source information. In a widely reported incident, Jonathan Corbett suggested that firearms hanging off the body might be invisible against the dark background [8], an attack we confirm and refine in Section 3.1. Two physicists, Leon Kaufman and Joseph Carlson, reverse-engineered the Secure 1000’s characteristics from published scans and concluded that "[i]t is very likely that a large (15–20 cm in diameter), irregularly-shaped, 1 cm-thick pancake of plastic explosive with beveled edges, taped to the abdomen, would be invisible to this technology" [21], an attack we confirm and refine in Section 3.3.

Keeping basic information about the device secret made an informed public debate about its use at airports more difficult, but did not prevent dangerous attacks from being devised. However, keeping attackers from testing attacks on the machine might. To a degree that surprised us, our attacks benefited from testing on the device itself. Our first attempts at implementing a new attack strategy were often visible to the scanner, and reliable concealment was made possible only through iteration and refinement. It goes without saying that software-replacement attacks on the console are practical only if one has a machine to reverse-engineer. Therefore, we conclude that, in the case of the Secure 1000, keeping the machine out of the hands of would-be attackers may be an effective strategy for preventing reliable exploitation, even if the details of the machine’s operation were disclosed.

The effectiveness of such a strategy depends critically on the difficulty of obtaining access to the machine. In addition to the device we purchased, at least one other Secure 1000 was available for sale on eBay for months after we obtained ours. We do not know whether it sold or to whom. Additionally, front-line security personnel will always have some level of access to the device at each deployment instance. Attaching contraband to the side of the body, as described in Section 3.1, is a straightforward attack enabled by scanning only straight-on rather than from all angles. However, the operator’s manual shows only example images where the contraband is clearly at the front or the back.

The other attacks we describe in Sections 3 and 4, which allow us to circumvent or weaken the advertised efficacy, privacy, and security claims, again show that the system’s designers failed to think adversarially. Simplicity and modular design are also crucial for security. The system control board implements simple, well-defined functionality and communicates with the operator console via a simple protocol. We were unable to compromise the control board by abusing the communication protocol. This is in contrast to the scanner console, whose software runs on a general-purpose COTS operating system. Simplicity and modular design prevented worse attacks, but do other AITs reflect these design principles? Modern embedded systems tend towards greater integration, increased software control, and remote network capabilities, which are anathema to security.

Components should be designed with separation of concerns in mind: each component should be responsible for controlling one aspect of the machine’s operation. Communication between components should be constrained. Given these facts, imposing stricter purchase controls on backscatter X-ray machines than those currently enacted may not be enough to keep determined adversaries from accessing, studying, and experimenting with them.
