When it comes to node servers, expressjs has now got tough competition when it
comes to performance.  
Here is a benchmark which shows some alternatives like micro, connect and
fastify are much faster/efficient than expressjs.
Are there any plans of next.js moving to one of these faster alternatives to
expressjs?
