User: Is there a way to avoid GAE server restart when the file within the root of my application changes. I use Go (GAE server is python based) runtime. 
The intention is not to reload the server when some of my files (html, css, js files; which are under /static folder) changes. This is to avoid startup time during development. Any way to exclude them from file watch.
thanks.
Assistant: If you change the files that comprise your application, the application will need to restart in order to serve the new files.
If this is a real sticking point for you, I would suggest hosting the files elsewhere, like a CDN. Your application and the static resources that it employs do not need to be all in the same place.
