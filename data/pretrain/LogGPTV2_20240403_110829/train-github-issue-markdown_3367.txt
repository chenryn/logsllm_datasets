**Current behavior**
In a lazy loaded module, I use a route resolver that uses a service provided
at the module level. The resolve creates a new instance of that service.
Before angular 2.2.x, it wasn't creating a new instance.
**Expected behavior**
Reuse the same service instance provided by the lazy module in the resolve.  
It shouldn't create a new instance of the service just like in angular 2.1.x
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
Both are the same exact plnkr, using different angular versions.  
NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED HERE: See plnkr using angular > 2.1 :

WORKING AS EXPECTED HERE: See plnkr using angular 2.1.0 :

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
If data is stored in the service, it's not accessible within the resolve. OR
if you store data from the resolve, it won't be accessible in components
because it is not the same service instance.
