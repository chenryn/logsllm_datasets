User: I'm currently working on a stub for tests purpose. Using Python I need to create a process with a specific name ("mysoft") and a specific pid ("1234")
My final purpose is to be able to run the command "pgrep mysoft" on a terminal and get the PID I set (1234).
The process doesn't need to do anything, it just need to exists.
I looked at the subprocess module but I think this is not exactly what I need. What do you think ?
Assistant: To run a process with the name mysoft, 

Create a python with the name mysoft without .py extension. 
Inside that file create a endless while loop or something like that, in a way that it runs long time. Or put a line like raw_input("enter something"). It will wait until you give the input.
Make the file executable by chmod 775 [filename]
First line of this file should be #!/usr/bin/python. Change this line according to your python path.
Put this file system path. Or add this file path to system path. (eg. /home/[user]/bin/)
Now, type mysoft. It will start.

You need to kill this manually when you want to terminate this process. Setting pid to a process is not possible to my knowledge.
