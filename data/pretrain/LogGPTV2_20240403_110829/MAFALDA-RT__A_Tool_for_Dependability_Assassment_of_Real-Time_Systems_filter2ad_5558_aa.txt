# Authors: Manuel Rodríguez, Arnaud Albinet, and Jean Arlat

## Abstract
This paper introduces a new prototype tool called MAFALDA-RT (Microkernel Assessment by Fault Injection Analysis and Design Aid for Real-Time Systems), aimed at the dependability assessment of real-time systems. The tool proposes an innovative method to address the problem of temporal intrusiveness caused by the use of Software-Implemented Fault Injection (SWIFI). In addition to typical failure modes (e.g., application crashes, system crashes, exceptions, etc.), MAFALDA-RT's observation capabilities extend to temporal measurements characterizing both the executive and application layers (e.g., task processing, task synchronization, context switching, system calls, etc.). The utility of the tool is demonstrated through a set of results from a significant case study based on a real-time system comprising the Chorus microkernel and a mini-train control application.

## 1. Introduction
Among various fault injection techniques, software-implemented fault injection (SWIFI) has become increasingly popular. By flipping bits in processor registers or memory, SWIFI can emulate the consequences of transient hardware faults and, to some extent, software faults [1]. SWIFI can be applied at different layers of the target system, including the processor, microkernel, operating system, middleware, and applications. Several related techniques and tools have been developed to support SWIFI, such as FERRARI [2], Xception [3], and MAFALDA [4]. Recently, an extension called Scan Chain-implemented Fault Injection (SCIFI) has been proposed, which provides a "reachability" level similar to simulation-based techniques (e.g., VHDL simulation) by leveraging the testing facilities in modern VLSI components [5].

Despite its valuable properties, applying SWIFI to assess dependable systems with stringent real-time requirements raises the issue of temporal disturbances caused by the overheads of most current SWIFI instrumentations. This is known as temporal intrusiveness or probe effect. The main sources of temporal intrusiveness are i) the time required for fault injection and ii) the time required for observing the system behavior.

This paper presents the main features of the MAFALDA-RT tool, a completely new version of the MAFALDA tool [4]. It features two novel assessment capabilities: i) virtual elimination of temporal intrusiveness and ii) enhanced observations in the temporal domain. Another major change is the management of the conduct and exploitation of fault injection campaign results, controlled via a database.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the tool's structure. Sections 3 and 4 focus on the original features of MAFALDA-RT related to the temporal characteristics of fault injection and measurement capabilities. Section 5 provides examples of results and analyses. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. Structure of the Tool
The architecture of MAFALDA-RT (Figure 1) consists of several Target Machines (Intel Pentium-based PC boards) running the real-time system(s) under test, and a Host Machine (a Sun workstation) that controls and analyzes the fault injection campaigns. The Target Machines can run either the same system to speed up campaigns or different systems for comparison purposes.

### 2.1. Components in the Target Machines
In the Target Machines, MAFALDA-RT comprises the following modules:

- **Injector (INJ)**: Consists of a set of exception handlers that inject faults. Faults are based on transient bit flips in RAM memory. Fault injection targets code segments of various components forming the microkernel (e.g., scheduler, synchronization manager, time manager, etc.), known as kernel injection. Application task corruption is targeted at the memory image of the stacks where system call parameters are passed to the microkernel, known as parameter injection.

- **Observer (OBS)**: Consists of a set of data interceptors that observe the target system. The interceptors capture temporal and value data, allowing the determination of both failure modes and system performance. Some intercepted items include scheduler events (e.g., context switches), task results, signals (e.g., exceptions), and the beginning, termination, and return code of system calls. All intercepted items are timestamped.

- **Device Controller (DC)**: Controls system devices to eliminate temporal intrusiveness introduced by the fault injection and observation instrumentation of the SWIFI tool (see Section 3). This is mainly achieved by acting on the hardware clock. External devices, such as sensors and actuators, are also controlled by their corresponding driver software, usually available during the system evaluation phase.

### 2.2. Core of MAFALDA-RT in the Host Machine
The core of MAFALDA-RT in the Host Machine is the Database (a SQL-based database called PostgresSQL [6]), which stores all information necessary for the configuration, development, and analysis of fault injection campaigns. The database contains four main types of information: attributes of the target systems, configuration of campaigns, experiment characterization, and experimental results.

MAFALDA-RT provides a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) connected to the Database. The GUI is composed of the Campaign Manager, Experiment Manager, and Graph Manager.

- **Campaign Manager**: Allows the user to enter the attributes of the target systems and configure the fault injection campaigns. Attributes of the target systems characterize the injection targets, such as the memory addresses of functional components and the list of kernel calls and parameters. Campaign configuration includes parameters defining the fault injection experiments (e.g., fault model, trigger, duration, type) and the real-time applications (e.g., executable files, target machines).

- **Experiment Manager**: Controls the fault injection experiments and stores and filters the raw data gathered from the target machines into the Database. The filtered data include experiment characterization (e.g., actual activation of injected faults, corrupted memory addresses, time of injection, fault model) and experimental results (e.g., failure modes, performance metrics like processor utilization, response times, laxity).

- **Graph Manager**: Allows the user to define analysis scripts for performing different types of analyses on the results stored in the Database, which can then be graphically displayed.

When a Target machine hangs, only a hardware reset can reinitialize it. To automate experiments, a simple relay-based integrated circuit (HW RESET) has been implemented to automatically reboot a Target machine at the end of each experiment.

## 3. Addressing Temporal Intrusiveness of SWIFI
The necessary interactions of SWIFI with the target system can significantly impact the temporal behavior of the system. In many practical situations, such intrusiveness may be acceptable, but it can become unacceptable when dealing with stringent temporal requirements (e.g., task deadlines) in real-time systems. Special care is needed to minimize or at least control the potential temporal alterations introduced by the tool (both for fault injection and observation).

To address this, MAFALDA-RT provides means to properly control system devices, creating an ideal environment where the temporal overhead of the tool is eliminated. Informally, this approach involves freeing the progression of time while the tool executes, making the tool execution appear instantaneous to the system.
