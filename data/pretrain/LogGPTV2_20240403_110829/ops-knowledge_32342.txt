User: I have a program output files. I use celery to output the files with two parallel computers so the output files will distributed in two computers. How can I write a program read files from these two computers?
Assistant: This question lacks details. 
I guess you need distributed file system, with which both of your computers can work. There are plenty of solutions: GridFS in MongoDB, HDFS in Hadoop. You can also try more simple solution like SSHFS. In this case, one of your servers will connect to other's server file system. rsync can clone remote directory if you are not worried about consistency.
