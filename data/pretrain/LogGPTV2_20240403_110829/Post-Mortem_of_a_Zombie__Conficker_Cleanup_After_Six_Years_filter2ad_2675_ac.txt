unique to one list, and that overlap between independent
lists was typically less than one percent [34]. In other
words, Conﬁcker bots should be considered worthwhile
targets for cleanup.
6The calculated overlap in terms of bots might be inﬂated as a re-
sult of both NAT and DHCP churn. Churn can in this case have both an
over-counting and under-counting effect. Under-counting will occur if
one bot appears in the two sinkholes with different IP addresses, as a
result of different connection times to the sinkholes. Doing the IP com-
parisons at a daily level yields a 6% overlap, which is still considerable.

Institutional Factors
Given that anti-botnet initiatives cannot explain the vari-
ation among the country parameters shown in ﬁgure 8,
we turn our attention to several institutional factors that
are often attributed with malware infection rates (e.g., see
[40]). These are broadband access, unlicensed software
use, and ICT development on a national level. In addi-
tion, given the spreading mechanism of Conﬁcker, we
also look at Operating System market shares, as well as
PC upgrade cycles. We correlate these factors with the
relevant parameters.

Correlating Growth Rate
Broadband access is often mentioned as a technolog-
ical enabler of malware; in particular, since Conﬁcker
was a worm that spread initially by scanning for hosts
to infect, one could expect its growth in countries with
higher broadband speeds to be faster. Holding other fac-
tors constant, most epidemiological models would also
predict this faster growth with increased network speeds.
This turns out not to be the case. The Spearman cor-
relation coefﬁcient between average national broadband
speeds, as reported by the International Telecommunica-
tion Union [15], and Conﬁcker growth rate is in fact neg-
ative: -0.30. This is most probably due to other factors
confounding with higher broadband speeds, e.g. national
wealth. In any case, the effects of broadband access and
speeds are negligible compared to other factors, and we
will not pursue this further.
Correlating Height of Peak
As we saw, there is a wide dispersion between countries
in the peak number of Conﬁcker bots. What explains the
large differences in peak infection rates?
Operating system market shares: Since Conﬁcker
only infects machines running Windows 2000, XP, Vista,
or Server 2003/2008, some variation in peak height may
be explained by differences in use of these operating sys-
tems (versus Windows 7 or non-Windows systems). We
use data from StatCounter Global Stats [36], which is
based on page view analytics of some three million web-
sites. Figure 9 shows the peak height against the com-
bined Windows XP and Vista market shares in January
2010 (other vulnerable OS versions were negligible). We
see a strong correlation — with a Pearson correlation co-
efﬁcient of 0.55. This in itself is perhaps not surprising.
Dividing the peak heights by the XP/Vista market
shares gives us estimates of the peak number of infections
per vulnerable user; we shall call this metric(cid:31)hp. This
metric allows for fairer comparisons between countries,
as one would expect countries with higher market shares
of vulnerable OS’s to harbor more infections regardless
of other factors. Interestingly, there is still considerable
variation in this metric – the coefﬁcient of variance is 1.2.
We investigate two institutional factors that may explain
this variation.
ICT development index is an index published by the
ITU based on a number of well-established ICT indica-
tors. It allows for benchmarking and measuring the digi-
tal divide and ICT development among countries (based
on ICT readiness and infrastructure, ICT intensity and
use, ICT skills and literacy [15]). This is obviously a
broad indicator, and can indicate the ability to manage
cybersecurity risks, including botnet cleanups, among

Unlicensed software use or piracy rates are another
oft mentioned factor inﬂuencing malware infection rates.
In addition to the fact that pirated software might include
malware itself, users running pirated OS’s often turn off
automatic updates, for fear of updates disabling their un-
licensed software — even though Microsoft consistently
states that it will also ship security updates to unlicensed
versions of Windows [38]. Disabling automatic updates
leaves a machine open to vulnerabilities, and stops au-
tomated cleanups. We use the unlicensed software rates
calculated by the Business Software Alliance [5]. This

Since ICT development and piracy rates are them-
selves correlated, we use the following simple linear re-
gression to explore thier joint association with peak Con-
