### Unique to One List and Overlap Between Independent Lists

The overlap between independent lists is typically less than one percent [34]. This suggests that Conficker bots should be considered valuable targets for cleanup efforts.

### Calculated Overlap and Churn Effects

The calculated overlap in terms of bots may be inflated due to Network Address Translation (NAT) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) churn. Churn can result in both over-counting and under-counting. Under-counting occurs when a bot appears in two sinkholes with different IP addresses, due to different connection times. When comparing IP addresses at a daily level, the overlap is 6%, which is still significant.

### Institutional Factors

Given that anti-botnet initiatives cannot fully explain the variation among country parameters shown in Figure 8, we turn our attention to several institutional factors often associated with malware infection rates (e.g., see [40]). These factors include broadband access, unlicensed software use, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development on a national level. Additionally, given the spreading mechanism of Conficker, we also examine Operating System (OS) market shares and PC upgrade cycles. We correlate these factors with the relevant parameters.

### Correlating Growth Rate

Broadband access is often cited as a technological enabler of malware. Since Conficker initially spread by scanning for hosts to infect, one might expect its growth to be faster in countries with higher broadband speeds. Most epidemiological models would predict this. However, the Spearman correlation coefficient between average national broadband speeds, as reported by the International Telecommunication Union [15], and Conficker growth rate is negative: -0.30. This is likely due to other confounding factors, such as national wealth. In any case, the effects of broadband access and speeds are negligible compared to other factors, and we will not pursue this further.

### Correlating Height of Peak

There is a wide dispersion in the peak number of Conficker bots across countries. What explains the large differences in peak infection rates?

#### Operating System Market Shares

Since Conficker only infects machines running Windows 2000, XP, Vista, or Server 2003/2008, some variation in peak height may be explained by differences in the use of these operating systems. We use data from StatCounter Global Stats [36], based on page view analytics from approximately three million websites. Figure 9 shows the peak height against the combined Windows XP and Vista market shares in January 2010 (other vulnerable OS versions were negligible). There is a strong correlation, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.55. 

Dividing the peak heights by the XP/Vista market shares gives us an estimate of the peak number of infections per vulnerable user, denoted as \( \hat{h}_p \). This metric allows for fairer comparisons between countries, as one would expect countries with higher market shares of vulnerable OSs to have more infections regardless of other factors. Interestingly, there is still considerable variation in this metric, with a coefficient of variance of 1.2. We investigate two institutional factors that may explain this variation.

### ICT Development Index

The ICT Development Index, published by the ITU, is based on well-established ICT indicators. It benchmarks and measures the digital divide and ICT development among countries, considering ICT readiness and infrastructure, ICT intensity and use, and ICT skills and literacy [15]. This broad indicator can reflect the ability to manage cybersecurity risks, including botnet cleanups. Figure 10 shows the relationship between \( \hat{h}_p \) and the ICT Development Index, revealing a strong correlation.

### Unlicensed Software Use

Unlicensed software use or piracy rates are another frequently mentioned factor influencing malware infection rates. Pirated software may include malware, and users running pirated OSs often disable automatic updates, fearing that updates will disable their unlicensed softwareâ€”despite Microsoft's assurances that security updates are provided to unlicensed versions of Windows [38]. Disabling automatic updates leaves machines vulnerable and hinders automated cleanups. We use the unlicensed software rates calculated by the Business Software Alliance [5], which also show a strong correlation with \( \hat{h}_p \).

### Joint Association with Peak Infection Rates

Since ICT development and piracy rates are themselves correlated, we use the following simple linear regression to explore their joint association with peak Conficker infection rates:

\[ \log(\hat{h}_p) = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{ict-dev} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{piracy} + \epsilon \]

where both regressors were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations. The least squares estimates (standard errors) are \( \hat{\beta}_1 = -0.78(0.27) \), \( p < 0.01 \), and \( \hat{\beta}_2 = 1.7(0.27) \), \( p < 0.001 \). These coefficients can be interpreted as follows: everything else being equal, countries with low (one standard deviation below the mean) ICT development have \( e^{0.78} = 2.2 \) times more Conficker bots per XP/Vista user at the peak than those with high ICT development.
