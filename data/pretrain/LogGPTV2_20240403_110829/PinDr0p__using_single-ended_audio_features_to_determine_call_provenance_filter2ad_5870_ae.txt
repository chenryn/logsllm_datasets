The concept of data provenance in computing was ﬁrst studied in
database systems. These techniques seek to identify the source of a
piece of data and the process by which it arrived at the database [13,
21, 11]. Such information can be proactively added at the source
and transformation points as metadata [18, 15] or reactively ob-
tained through techniques such as query inversion [58, 14]. Such
techniques have been adapted and extended to other platforms in-
cluding web servers with trusted hardware [35]. The presence of
such mechanisms provides a signiﬁcantly improved infrastructure
for performing audits and determining data quality [34].
More recently, a number of researchers have attempted to pro-
vide provenance information for networks. Traceback techniques [41,
?, 23] attempt to determine the true path of packets in the presence
of potentially spoofed source information. Such information can ei-
ther be added directly to the packets as metadata [41, 44, 59, 39], or
by state stored and queried from within the routers themselves [61].
A range of watermarking tools also exist to identify the provenance
of ﬂows in IP networks [56, 28, 24]. The diversity of telephony net-
works (i.e., circuit switched PSTN, cellular and VoIP) makes such
watermarks extremely difﬁcult. Speciﬁcally, metadata introduced
in one network (e.g., watermarks, path information) is generally
lost when the call is transmitted over another network.
We are not aware of previous work that attempts to identify the
provenance of a phone call in a diverse telephony environment.
However, techniques in a purely Internet-based environment have
been considered [46]. Perhaps the closest to our work are caller
identiﬁcation (Caller-ID) services that provide the caller’s number
or name in PSTN and mobile networks. Calls originating from IP
networks traditionally have no unique associated number or name
and therefore cannot be used to identify the caller [43]. Moreover,
a variety of techniques already exist to spoof phone numbers [2].
Artifacts of calls themselves may provide signiﬁcant provenance
information. Speciﬁcally, because call quality relies greatly on a
combination of the codec [31, 5], the range of end devices [12] and
network degradations [16, 40, 29], the detection of these character-
istics using tools designed to measure single-ended call quality [16,
11831, 40] can potentially be used to further improve the provenance
of a call.
8. CONCLUSION
Caller-ID has long been viewed as a reliable means of identify-
ing the source of a call. However, this mechanism is now easily
spoofable through a variety of free and low-cost techniques.
In
this paper, we take a ﬁrst step towards a mechanism capable of de-
termining call provenance — the source and the path taken by a
call. We leverage attributes of the audio delivered to the receiver,
including characteristics of the applied codes, packet loss proﬁles
and bit error rates. We use these measurable elements to identify
the codecs applied to incoming calls passing through as many as
three intermediary types of telephony networks with a 91.6% ac-
curacy. Moreover, ﬁngerprints for speciﬁc sources were identiﬁed
with between 90% and 100% accuracy with one and ﬁve training
sets, respectively. Through additional device-speciﬁc ﬁngerprint-
ing mechanisms and distance estimation techniques, we believe
that our mechanisms can be further improved and made more ro-
bust to attack.
