title:blackhat:us-22 All Your GNN Models and Data Belong to Me
Many real-world data come in the form of graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs), a new family of machine learning (ML) models, have been proposed to fully leverage graph data to build powerful applications. In particular, the inductive GNNs, which can generalize to unseen data, become mainstream in this direction. Those models have facilitated numerous practical solutions to real world problems, such as node classification, community detection link prediction/recommendation, binary similarity detection, malware detection, fraud detection, bot detection, etc.To train a good model, a large amount of proprietary data as well as computational resources are needed, leading to valuable intellectual property. Previous research has shown that ML models are prone to adversarial attacks, which aim to steal the functionality of the target models. However, most of them focus on the models trained with non-structured data (such as images and texts). On the other hand, little attention has been paid to the security of models trained with graph data, i.e., GNNs, and, more interestingly, the privacy of the raw data used to train GNNs. In this talk, we outline three novel attacks against GNNs, namely model stealing attack, link re-identification attack, and property inference attack. We first show that the attackers, disguised as benign customers of your commercially deployed GNN models, can leverage our model stealing attack to steal GNNs with high accuracy and high fidelity. We then demonstrate that the attackers can infer private and sensitive relationships contained in the raw data you used to train the GNNs. We finally reveal a novel graph reconstruction attack that can reconstruct a graph that has similar graph structural statistics to the target graph. Note that certain graph data is often expensive to obtain and proprietary (e.g., biomedical/molecular graph collected from lab study). Such graph reconstruction attacks may pose a direct threat to pharmaceutical companies leveraging GNNs to accelerate drug discovery.
