I have pinned my nine most frequently used applications to the taskbar, which allows me to quickly switch between them using the `Win+1` to `Win+9` shortcuts. Additionally, I utilize different virtual desktops for various purposes, such as separating my home and work environments.

For this setup, it would be highly beneficial to have the ability to organize the pinned taskbar items according to the specific purpose of each virtual desktop.
