I have first 9 taskbar items pinned for apps that I use the most. I really
love the fast switching between apps using `Win+1..9`.
Also, I'm using different virtual desktops for different purposes (home x
work).
For such setup, it would be really useful to have the possibility to organize
pinned taskbar items per purpose of the desktop.
