User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Need help generating a core dump from apache segfault I have a script which intermittently returns a white screen of death in firefox and Error 324 (net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE): Unknown error. chrome.

When I try to access the script using a PHP HTTP client (like Zend_Http_Client), intermittently I get an exception (sorry I don't have the exact message on me at the moment).

I suspect a segfault. This is further buttressed by the lines in my error log that look like this: [Thu Mar 18 16:03:02 2010] [notice] child pid 845 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)

Now, I'm running RedHat, and I know that RedHat doesn't generate core dumps out-of-the-box. I followed the instructions here http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-5353, but I'm not seeing any core dumps. 

How do I generate a core dump?

Assistant: This may be related to issues I found a solution for with generating a core dump on Centos (which is redhat based). The related answer is here, albeit for php-fpm rather than apache.


  The stumbling block for me, and I suspect for you too, is that if a process has changed it's own execution privileges, it is not permitted to produce a core dump file unless /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable is set to allow this. See information about this kernel-level control here.


If apache is initializing as root and running it's worker processes with reduced privileges, this may be affected by the above option, in addition to the other settings required to set (core dump path, core size limit, etc.)
