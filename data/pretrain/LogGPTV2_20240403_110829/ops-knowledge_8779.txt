User: I would like to use Neo4j from Python in Windows 7 operating system. Which library can I install? Py2Neo seems to work for Linux and Mac but not for Windows.
Assistant: py2Neo is a library which you can generate/configure/manipulate Neo4j graph database. It is not an executable application. As far as your Python works on Windows, py2neo should work as well. You can download py2neo via pip install as you can download many libraries as well.
