You must sign up for a free account with LogMeIn to complete the install
process, and you will need an email address. When you register, you have
improved network management, administration, and the ability to create
networks. When you have entered an email and password, you will need to
create a client‐owned network. This will include a unique network ID and
password so you can manage your new VPN. This peer‐to‐peer VPN is using
AES 256‐bit encryption to secure your data. You can share the network ID
with up to five people for free, and they can install the client, use
the network ID you created, and join your network. If you need more than
five members per network, you may want to look at standard or premium
packages.
LogMeIn has been tested with many operating systems, and the most
current version supports the following:
-   [Windows Vista (all versions)]{#c06.xhtml#c06-li-0006}
-   [Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard, Business
    Editions]{#c06.xhtml#c06-li-0007}
-   [Windows 7, 8.1, and 10]{#c06.xhtml#c06-li-0008}
-   [[]{#c06.xhtml#Page_75 .pagebreak title="75"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}Windows Server 2012]{#c06.xhtml#c06-li-0009}

-   [CentOS 7.2 and above]{#c06.xhtml#c06-li-0012}
Depending on the topology you have chosen, keep in mind that you cannot
assign the Gateway Node functionality to a Mac or Small Business Server.

## Tor {#c06.xhtml#head-2-49}
The more you learn about cybersecurity, the more paranoid you may seem
to those who do not understand the interworking of the Internet.
Monitoring of traffic on the Internet is widespread, and there are many
organizations, including governments, corporations, and criminals, that
can monitor your traffic covertly. In 2003, a program called
Total/Terrorism Information Awareness was established by the United
States Information Awareness Office to gather detailed information about
individuals in an attempt to prevent crimes before they happened. They
called this *predictive policing*.
Many civil rights organizations and privacy groups like Reporters
Without Borders and the American Civil Liberties Union have expressed
concern that with ever‐increasing surveillance, we will end up with
limited political or personal freedoms. There are hacktivist
organizations such as Anonymous, Lizard Squad, Morpho, and APT28 that
all have their own modus operandi and moral code.
Edward Snowden, whether you believe what he did was right or wrong,
showed us how the NSA is using tailored access operation (TAO) to
compromise common computer systems and force companies to purposefully
insert vulnerabilities into their own systems for TAO to exploit. An
example of this is []{#c06.xhtml#Page_79 .pagebreak title="79"
role="doc-pagebreak"}WARRIOR PRIDE, which is iPhone and Android software
that can turn on a phone remotely, turn on the microphone, and activate
geolocation. The modules of this kit have cartoon names, including
Dreamy Smurf, which handles power management; Nosey Smurf, which can
turn on the microphone; and Tracker Smurf, which turns on high‐precision
geolocation.
According to `www.statistica.com`, Google had more than 2 billion users
in 2017. There are a little more than 7 billion people on the planet.
One of the first things I do when teaching a Metasploit class or an
open‐source intelligence (OSINT) class is to have my students Google
themselves. When you get to the My Activity page in Google, depending on
your privacy settings, you\'ll see a []{#c06.xhtml#Page_80 .pagebreak
title="80" role="doc-pagebreak"}timeline of activity, websites you\'ve
visited, and images you\'ve viewed. Have you ever had a conversation
with a friend and the very next ad you see on your PC or your phone is
in direct correlation to the conversation you had?
Tor (also called The Onion Router) is the answer to much of this. Tor is
a network that enables you to stay anonymous on the Internet. Tor is
based on "onion routing" developed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
and was launched in 2002. The Tor Project (`www.torproject.org`) is a
nonprofit organization that currently maintains and develops the free
Tor Browser client. The U.S. government funds it with some support by
the Swedish government and some individual contributors.
Is Tor illegal? No. Is engaging in activities that are illegal in your
country on Tor illegal? Yes.
Some cyber professionals believe that using Incognito mode in Chrome is
the same thing as running Tor. Browsing the Internet in Incognito mode
only keeps the browser from saving your history, cookies, or form data.
It does not hide your browsing from your ISP, employer, spouse, or the
NSA. To activate Incognito mode in a Chrome browser, press the
Ctrl+Shift+N. In [Figure
6.12](#c06.xhtml#c06-fig-0012){#c06.xhtml#R_c06-fig-0012}, you see
Chrome in Incognito mode.
![[**[Figure 6.12](#c06.xhtml#R_c06-fig-0012){#c06.xhtml#c06-fig-0012
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Chrome in Incognito
mode](Images/c06f012.jpg){.center width="599" height="359"}
By contrast, Tor reduces the risk of traffic analysis by distributing it
so that no single point can link you to your destination. To create a
private network path, the users of the Tor Browser client will
incrementally build a circuit of encrypted connections through different
relays on the network. In [Figure
6.13](#c06.xhtml#c06-fig-0013){#c06.xhtml#R_c06-fig-0013}, you see the
