Abstract. In this paper, we empirically analyze two examples of a West-
ern (DE) versus Middle-East (SA) Online Social Messaging App. By
focusing on the system interactions over time in comparison, we identify
inherent diﬀerences in user engagement. We take a deep dive and shed
light onto diﬀerences in user attention shifts and showcase their struc-
tural implications to the user experience. Our main ﬁndings show that in
comparison to the German counterparts, the Saudi communities prefer
creating content in longer conversations, while voting more conservative.
1 Introduction
Every social networking platform depends on an active user-base. The recent
pandemic disruption has even accelerated the shift of our everyday’s life into
digital spaces, may it be at work or socially. What constitutes an active user-
base and if cultural diﬀerences exist in this usage behavior, however, is unclear.
Social network analysis is an active ﬁeld of research for more than a decade.
Research provided a general understanding through the empirical and qualita-
tive analyses of a number of diﬀerent networks. Examples include structural
measurements of classic online social networks [11,23,24,29] as well as more
specialized variants such as microblogging [4], picture sharing [6,33], or knowl-
edge sharing [35]. Works in this ﬁeld analyzed the networks’ structure, mostly
using graph-theory approaches. This way, they showed that social networks usu-
ally creates small-world networks [8,20]. The inﬂuence of cultural or geographic
backgrounds on usage largely remain unknown.
Most studies either focus on analyzing social-media usage worldwide or by
focusing on speciﬁc parts of the world, mostly English speaking. These works
have enriched our understanding of social media. Yet it is unclear if or to what
extent the obtained measures diﬀer between diﬀerent geographic regions. Cul-
tural diﬀerences are known to exist that drive human behavior in social networks,
e.g., the degree of connectivity [15] or how marketers use social media to impact
purchase decisions [9]. Yet, little is known on how geographic or cultural back-
grounds may impact the way users interact with a social media platform in terms
of the generated traﬃc; that is, content creation and content voting.

In this work, we take the rare chance to analyze ground truth information pro-
vided by a social network operator to compare interactions with a social media
platform of a Western (Germany) and a Middle-Eastern (Saudi Arabia) coun-
try. We selected both countries since they represent the largest user-bases of the
Jodel platform, while simultaneously representing a largely diﬀerent (cultural)
background. Our data sets capture the entirety of all social media interactions
in both countries since the very ﬁrst post. This way, we can, for the ﬁrst time,
shed light on whether geographic or culture speciﬁc diﬀerences exist between
both countries w.r.t. how the user-bases generate and vote content.
The studied social media platform Jodel is location-based and anonymous.
Most importantly, the feature of Jodel to form independent local communities
enables us to compare in-country and between country eﬀects and thereby to
clearly identify country speciﬁc usage diﬀerences. Further, it does not display
any form of user proﬁles or other user-related information that would introduce
visible social credit; users solely interact framed into their physical proximity
and based on their topic preferences. This results in a pure form of communi-
cation that is reduced to content, since any form of inﬂuence by user proﬁles
such as social status is absent. This makes Jodel an ideal platform to study dif-
ferences in content creation and voting, i.e., the entirety of active interactions
with this social network. We shed light on fundamentally diﬀerent user behav-
ior and engagement patterns within such anonymous spaces having received less
attention as of today, across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Germany; and
showcase structural implications. Our contributions are as follows.
– While not a primary focus of our work, we empirically show the very diﬀerent
adoption processes of a new social media platform in both countries.
– We show that, invariant to time and community size, users in Saudi-Arabia
(Middle-East) behave fundamentally diﬀerent to the German counterparts
(Western country). They prefer creating content, but vote slightly less than
the German users. This highlights, for the ﬁrst time, that country-level diﬀer-
ences in the usage culture in social media exist that create drastic diﬀerences
in user behavior of the very same social media platform.
– We exemplify the implications of shown user engagement to the social media
platform. E.g., we show that the availability of more content in Saudi Arabia
naturally decreases the available votes per post, which can have serious impact
on, e.g., distributed community moderation techniques.
2 The Jodel App
Jodel is a mobile-only messaging application which we show in Fig. 1. It is
location-based and establishes local communities relative to the users’ location
0 . Within these communities, users can anonymously post both images and
(i.e., microblogging) and
textual content of up to 250 characters length
4 . Posted content is referred to as
reply to posts forming discussion threads
3 . Posts are only displayed to other users within
“Jodels”, colored randomly
close (up to ≈20 km) geographic proximity
2 . Further, all communication is

anonymous to other users since no user handles or other user-related information
are displayed. Only within a single discussion thread, users are enumerated to
enable referencing to other users. Threads are displayed to the users in three

diﬀerent feeds
showing the most discussed threads, and iii) loudest showing threads with the
highest voting score.

Jodel employs a community-driven ﬁltering and moderation scheme to avoid
adverse content. For an anonymous messaging app, community moderation is a
key success parameter to prevent harmful or abusive content. In Jodel, content
ﬁltering relies on a distributed voting scheme in which every user can increase
9 (similar
or decrease a post’s vote score by up- (+1)
8 below a nega-
to StackOverﬂow). Posts reaching a cumulative vote score
tive threshold (e.g., –5) are no longer displayed. Depending on the number of
vote-contributions, this scheme ﬁlters out adverse content while also potentially
preferring mainstream content. To increase user engagement w.r.t. posting and
voting, Jodesl uses lightweight gamiﬁcation by awarding Karma points
7 or downvoting (–1)

3 Dataset Description and Ethics
The Jodel network operators provided us with anonymized ground truth data
of their network, cf. Table 1. The obtained data contains post and interaction
metadata created within Germany and the KSA only, and spans over multi-
ple years from the beginning of the network in 2014 up to August 2017. It
is limited to metadata only without textual content and user records stripped
and anonymized. The data enables us to cluster users by their anonymous ID.
Further, it contains no personal information and cannot be used to personally
414

identify users. While users consent to research via the Jodel ToS, we also inform
and synchronize with the Jodel operator about evaluations we perform on their
data. The structure of our available dataset includes 3 categories: interactions,
content, and users.
Table 1. Dataset Statistics. The data ranges from the application start in late
2014 up to the beginning of August 2017. We ﬁnd the ﬁrst observation in the KSA in
December 2014.

Dataset Limitations. Our dataset only includes the users’ active interactions
with the system, where they contribute like registering, creating posts, reply-
ing, or voting. Thus, we cannot infer when or how much a user only passively
participates—lurkers—who only consume content. Further, the vote interactions
are always mapped to the date and community of the respective content creation.
This prevents us from making detailed analyses depending on the voting time or
place. However, due to the vivid usage of the application (multiple posts/replies
per minute), we generally consider votes to be executed on the same day as
their respective content. Especially since posts are only accessible via the three
diﬀerent feeds, where they will only stay for a very limited time, casting votes
long after the content creation is usually not possible.
4 The Birth of the Jodel Networks in DE and the KSA
The growth patterns of social networks are less understood given that data cap-
tures from the very beginning of a social media platform are typically unavail-
able. We take the rare chance to begin showcasing the rate in which the Jodel
platform established itself in both countries. Our ﬁrst peek is relevant to bet-
ter understand network activity and to deﬁne a meaningful aggregate layer for
comparison, e.g., time slices, for studying cultural shifts in social media usage
in the next section. We thus remark that a detailed study of the shown adoption
pattern is beyond the scope of this paper.
4.1 Diﬀerent Adoption Pattern in Germany and the KSA
We show the adoption of the Jodel network in both networks by the number of
interactions over time in Fig. 2. The ﬁgure shows the number of weekly interac-
tions for Germany (solid line) and the KSA (dotted) since the very ﬁrst inter-
action till the end of our data set in August 2017. With interaction, we refer to
any interaction with the Jodel system, i.e., either posting, replying, or voting.

Fig. 2. Jodel activity in Germany (DE) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (SA) over
our observation time. While the DE network enjoys a steady growth over time, the
usage in the KSA has suddenly surged and remains stable.
The adoption of Jodel in Germany is characterized by a slow but rather
steady growth of network activity over time, peaking in 2016/2017. This captures
the birth of the Jodel network that originated in Germany and then constantly
increased in popularity. In contrast to the steady increasing activity in Germany,
the adoption of Jodel in the KSA is characterized by a substantial inﬂux of users
and an increase in activity at a short time in March 2017. To our best knowledge,
the reason for this behavior is that Jodel went viral via social media in Saudi
Arabia—in absence of any marketing campaigns of the operator itself.
While studying the reasons that were driving these adoption processes is
beyond the scope of this paper, their adoption processes diﬀer substantially. That
is, referring to Table 1, in only 4 months, Jodel KSA has roughly gathered 1.2
