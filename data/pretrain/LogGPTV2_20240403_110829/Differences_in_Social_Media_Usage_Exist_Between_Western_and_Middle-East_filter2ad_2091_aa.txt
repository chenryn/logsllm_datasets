**Abstract:**
In this paper, we empirically analyze the differences in social media usage between a Western (Germany) and a Middle Eastern (Saudi Arabia) country, focusing on the Jodel platform. By comparing system interactions over time, we identify inherent differences in user engagement, attention shifts, and their structural implications on user experience. Our findings indicate that Saudi Arabian users prefer creating longer content and vote more conservatively compared to their German counterparts.

**1. Introduction**
Social networking platforms rely on an active user base, and the recent pandemic has accelerated the shift of daily life into digital spaces. However, it is unclear what constitutes an active user base and whether cultural differences influence usage behavior. Social network analysis, which has been an active field of research for over a decade, has provided general insights through empirical and qualitative analyses of various networks. These studies have shown that social networks often form small-world networks, but the influence of cultural or geographic backgrounds on usage remains largely unknown.

Most existing studies focus on global social media usage or specific English-speaking regions. While these studies have enhanced our understanding of social media, it is unclear how usage patterns differ across different geographic regions. Cultural differences are known to impact human behavior in social networks, such as the degree of connectivity and how marketers use social media to influence purchase decisions. However, little is known about how geographic or cultural backgrounds affect the way users interact with social media platforms, particularly in terms of content creation and voting.

In this work, we analyze ground truth data provided by the Jodel platform to compare interactions in Germany and Saudi Arabia. We selected these countries because they represent the largest user bases of Jodel and have significantly different cultural backgrounds. Our dataset captures all social media interactions in both countries since the first post, allowing us to shed light on whether geographic or cultural differences exist in user-generated and voted content.

**2. The Jodel App**
Jodel is a mobile-only, location-based, and anonymous messaging application. It establishes local communities based on users' locations, where users can post images and text (up to 250 characters) anonymously. Posts, referred to as "Jodels," are displayed to other users within close geographic proximity (up to approximately 20 km). Communication is entirely anonymous, with no user handles or profiles displayed. Users can reply to posts, forming discussion threads, and upvote or downvote content. Jodel employs a community-driven moderation scheme to filter out adverse content, using a distributed voting system. Content reaching a negative threshold (e.g., -5 votes) is removed. To increase user engagement, Jodel uses gamification by awarding Karma points for upvoting or downvoting.

**3. Dataset Description and Ethics**
The Jodel network operators provided us with anonymized ground truth data spanning from 2014 to August 2017. The dataset includes metadata on users, content, and interactions, limited to Germany and Saudi Arabia. The data is stripped of personal information and cannot be used to identify individual users. Users consent to research via the Jodel Terms of Service, and we coordinate with the Jodel operator regarding our evaluations. The dataset includes three categories: interactions, content, and users.

**Dataset Limitations:**
Our dataset only captures active user interactions, such as registering, posting, replying, and voting. We cannot infer passive participation (lurkers) or detailed voting times and places. However, due to the high frequency of activity, we assume that most votes are cast on the same day as content creation.

**4. The Birth of the Jodel Networks in Germany and Saudi Arabia**
Understanding the growth patterns of social networks is challenging due to the unavailability of early data. We take the rare opportunity to analyze the adoption of Jodel in Germany and Saudi Arabia. This initial analysis helps us better understand network activity and define meaningful time slices for studying cultural shifts in social media usage.

**4.1 Different Adoption Patterns in Germany and Saudi Arabia**
Figure 2 shows the number of weekly interactions in Germany (solid line) and Saudi Arabia (dotted line) from the first interaction to August 2017. In Germany, Jodel's adoption is characterized by a slow but steady growth, peaking in 2016/2017. In contrast, Jodel's adoption in Saudi Arabia experienced a sudden surge in March 2017, likely due to the platform going viral without any marketing campaigns. This substantial difference in adoption patterns highlights the unique dynamics of user engagement in each country.

**Conclusion:**
Our study provides empirical evidence of significant differences in social media usage between Germany and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabian users prefer creating longer content and vote more conservatively, while German users show different engagement patterns. These findings underscore the importance of considering cultural and geographic factors when analyzing social media usage.
