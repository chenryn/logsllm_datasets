**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
`rpcping` is a utility that confirms the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) connectivity between a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server and supported Microsoft Exchange Client workstations on the network. It can be used to check if the Microsoft Exchange Server services are responding to RPC requests from client workstations via the network.

**Syntax:**
```sh
rpcping [/t <protocol>] [/s <server>] [/e <endpoint> | /f <UUID>[,majorver]] 
        [/O <object_UUID>] [/u <security_package>] [/a <auth_level>] 
        [/N <server_principal>] [/I <user,domain,password>] 
        [/C <hex_flags>] [/T <static|dynamic>] 
        [/M <anonymous|identify|impersonate|delegate>] 
        [/S <expected_SID>] [/P <proxy_identity>] 
        [/F <flags>] [/H <auth_schemes>] 
        [/B <cert_subject>] [/b] [/E] [/q] [/c] 
        [/A <proxy_identity>] [/U <proxy_auth_schemes>] 
        [/r <report_interval>] [/v <verbosity>] 
        [/d] [/p] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/t <protocol>**: Specifies the protocol sequence to use. Valid options include `ncacn_ip_tcp`, `ncacn_np`, or `ncacn_http`. The default is `ncacn_ip_tcp`.
- **/s <server>**: Specifies the server address. If not specified, the local machine will be pinged.
- **/e <endpoint>**: Specifies the endpoint to ping. If not specified, the endpoint mapper on the target machine will be pinged. This option is mutually exclusive with the `/f` option.
- **/f <UUID>[,majorver]**: Specifies the interface to ping. This option is mutually exclusive with the `/e` option. The interface is specified as a UUID. If `majorver` is not specified, version 1 of the interface will be sought. When this option is specified, `rpcping` will query the endpoint mapper on the target machine to retrieve the endpoint for the specified interface.
- **/O <object_UUID>**: Specifies the object UUID if the interface registered one.
- **/i <calls>**: Specifies the number of calls to make. The default is 1. This option is useful for measuring connection latency if multiple iterations are specified.
- **/u <security_package>**: Specifies the security package (security provider) RPC will use to make the call. The security package is identified by a number or name. If this option is specified, you must also specify an authentication level other than `none`. Possible values include:
  - Negotiate / 9 (nego, snego, negotiate)
  - NTLM / 10
  - SChannel / 14
  - Kerberos / 16
  - Kernel / 20
- **/a <auth_level>**: Specifies the authentication level to use. If this option is specified, the security package ID (`/u`) must also be specified. Possible values include:
  - connect
  - call
  - pkt
  - integrity
  - privacy
- **/N <server_principal>**: Specifies a server principal name. This field can only be used when both the authentication level and security package are selected.
- **/I <user,domain,password>**: Allows you to specify an alternative identity to connect to the server. The identity is in the form `user,domain,password`. If the user name, domain, or password contain special characters, enclose the identity in double quotes. You can specify `*` instead of the password, and RPC will prompt you to enter the password without echoing it on the screen. If this field is not specified, the identity of the logged-on user will be used. This field can only be used when both the authentication level and security package are selected.
- **/C <hex_flags>**: Specifies a hexadecimal bitmask of flags. This field can only be used when both the authentication level and security package are selected.
- **/T <static|dynamic>**: Specifies whether the binding is static or dynamic. If not specified, the default is `dynamic`. This field can only be used when both the authentication level and security package are selected.
- **/M <impersonation_level>**: Specifies the impersonation level. Possible values include:
  - anonymous
  - identify
  - impersonate (default)
  - delegate
  This field can only be used when both the authentication level and security package are selected.
- **/S <expected_SID>**: Specifies the expected SID of the server. This field can only be used when both the authentication level and security package are selected.
- **/P <proxy_identity>**: Specifies the identity to authenticate with to the RPC/HTTP proxy. Has the same format as for the `/I` option. You must specify the security package (`/u`), authentication level (`/a`), and authentication schemes (`/H`) to use this option.
- **/F <flags>**: Specifies the flags to pass for RPC/HTTP front-end authentication. The flags may be specified as numbers or names. Recognized flags include:
  - Use SSL / 1 (ssl, use_ssl)
  - Use first auth scheme / 2 (first, use_first)
  You must specify the security package (`/u`) and authentication level (`/a`) to use this option.
- **/H <auth_schemes>**: Specifies the authentication schemes to use for RPC/HTTP front-end authentication. This option is a list of numerical values or names separated by commas. Example: `Basic,NTLM`. Recognized values include:
  - Basic / 1 (Basic)
  - NTLM / 2 (NTLM)
  - Certificate / 65536 (Cert)
  You must specify the security package (`/u`) and authentication level (`/a`) to use this option.
- **/B <cert_subject>**: Specifies the server certificate subject. You must use SSL for this option to work. You must specify the security package (`/u`) and authentication level (`/a`) to use this option.
- **/b**: Retrieves the server certificate subject from the certificate sent by the server and prints it to the screen or a log file. Valid only when the Proxy echo only option (`/E`) and the use SSL options are specified. You must specify the security package (`/u`) and authentication level (`/a`) to use this option.
- **/R <http_proxy>**: Specifies the HTTP proxy. If none, the RPC proxy is used. The value `default` means to use the IE settings in your client machine. Any other value will be treated as the explicit HTTP proxy. If you do not specify this flag, the default value is assumed, that is, the IE settings are checked. This flag is valid only when the `/E` (echo Only) flag is enabled.
- **/E**: Restricts the ping to the RPC/HTTP proxy only. The ping does not reach the server. Useful when trying to establish whether the RPC/HTTP proxy is reachable. To specify an HTTP proxy, use the `/R` flag. If an HTTP proxy is specified in the `/o` flag, this option will be ignored. You must specify the security package (`/u`) and authentication level (`/a`) to use this option.
- **/q**: Specifies quiet mode. Does not issue any prompts except for passwords. Assumes a "Y" response to all queries. Use this option with care.
- **/c**: Uses a smart card certificate. `rpcping` will prompt the user to choose a smart card.
- **/A <proxy_identity>**: Specifies the identity with which to authenticate to the HTTP proxy. Has the same format as for the `/I` option. You must specify the authentication schemes (`/U`), security package (`/u`), and authentication level (`/a`) to use this option.
- **/U <proxy_auth_schemes>**: Specifies the authentication schemes to use for HTTP proxy authentication. This option is a list of numerical values or names separated by commas. Example: `Basic,NTLM`. Recognized values include:
  - Basic / 1 (Basic)
  - NTLM / 2 (NTLM)
  You must specify the security package (`/u`) and authentication level (`/a`) to use this option.
- **/r <report_interval>**: If multiple iterations are specified, this option will make `rpcping` display current execution statistics periodically instead of after the last call. The report interval is given in seconds. The default is 15.
- **/v <verbosity>**: Tells `rpcping` how verbose to make the output. The default value is 1. Values 2 and 3 provide more detailed output.
- **/d**: Launches the RPC network diagnostic UI.
- **/p**: Specifies to prompt for credentials if authentication fails.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

To find out if the Exchange server you connect through RPC/HTTP is accessible, type:
```sh
rpcping /t ncacn_http /s exchange_server /o RpcProxy=front_end_proxy /P username,domain,* /H Basic /u NTLM /a connect /F 3
```

This command will:
- Use the `ncacn_http` protocol.
- Ping the `exchange_server`.
- Use the `RpcProxy` option with the `front_end_proxy` value.
- Authenticate using the `username` and `domain` with a prompted password.
- Use the `Basic` authentication scheme.
- Use the `NTLM` security package.
- Set the authentication level to `connect`.
- Use the `Use SSL` and `Use first auth scheme` flags.
