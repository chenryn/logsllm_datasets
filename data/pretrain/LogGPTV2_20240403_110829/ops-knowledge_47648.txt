User: How to configure IP address in Windows system?
Assistant: To configure the IP address in the Windows system, you can follow the steps below: 1. Open the "Control Panel" and enter the "Network and Sharing Center". 2. Click "Change Adapter Settings" in the left navigation bar. 3. Find the network connection to configure the IP address, right-click it, and select "Properties". 4. Check Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and click the Properties button. 5. If your network requires a fixed IP address, select "Use the following IP address" and enter the IP address, subnet mask and default gateway address you want to use. Note: The IP address must match your network environment. You need to contact your network administrator to determine the correct IP address, subnet mask and default gateway address. 6. If your network is dynamically assigning IP addresses (DHCP), please make sure the options "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically" are selected. 7. Click OK to save your changes.
