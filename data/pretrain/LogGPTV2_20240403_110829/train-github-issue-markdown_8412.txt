I'm in the process of trying to get `jl_init` to work without having to
provide an argument for the general embedding case.
My current patch works on windows because `libjulia.dll` (whose path I'm using
to set julia_home) lives in the bin directory there, but breaks on *nix
because there it lives in a `lib` directory.
Of course, it's easy enough to patch the `lib` path to get the `bin` path, but
it begs the question as to whether `julia_home` should just point to a level
higher.
One fact in favor of redefining `julia_home` to point a level higher: the
majority of references to it begin by appending "..".
