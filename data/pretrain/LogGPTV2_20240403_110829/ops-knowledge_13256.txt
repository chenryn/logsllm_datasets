User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it possible for the administrator to see what I'm doing on my PC and how to prevent it? For example if I'm having a conversation in Skype, can he secretly log in in parallel with me and watch my screen? If yes, how to block him? I believe I have admin rights on my dev PC.

Assistant: Short answers: "Yes", and "you can't".

Bring your own laptop to work if you want privacy.
