### Limitations of the Dataset

One limitation of our dataset is that it only includes TCP traffic, whereas [35] and [10] use a mix of TCP and UDP traffic. However, basic statistics from the VPN dataset indicate that UDP traffic constitutes only 7.8% of the total, which is comparable to the fractions in [10] (ranging from 4% to 15%). We believe that these limitations—finite dataset length and the absence of non-TCP traffic—do not qualitatively affect our comparison with [35] and [10].

### Flow Characteristics Analysis

We analyze four fundamental flow characteristics: size, duration, rate, and burstiness. The size of a flow is defined as the total number of bytes, including headers, while the duration is the time span between the first and last packets of the flow. The flow rate is calculated by dividing the flow size by its duration. Following previous work [35, 10], we focus on longer-lived flows by excluding those with durations less than 100ms when computing the flow rate. The definition of burstiness will be provided later.

We first characterize the distributions of size, duration, and rate for all flows before focusing on "heavy-hitter" flows [31, 7], which are characterized by exceptionally large size, long duration, high speed, and strong burstiness. Understanding the behavior of heavy-hitter flows is crucial for various applications [13, 31, 22, 12], as described in §1. Due to the well-known heavy-tailed distribution of Internet flows, the number of such flows is very small, but they can contribute significantly to the overall traffic volume.

### Comparison with T-RAT Study

Figure 1 shows the complementary cumulative distribution (CCDF) of flow size, duration, and rate across seven datasets (represented by thick lines), compared with the T-RAT study, a recent TCP study similar to ours conducted in 2001 [35], whose eight datasets are shown as thin lines. For flow size and duration, no qualitative differences are observed in the log-log plot. However, we observe much higher flow rates in our dataset. For example, in the T-RAT datasets, only 4% to 10% of flows exceed 100kbps, whereas in our dataset, at least 17% of flows exceed this rate. This increase can be attributed to higher-speed backbone links and the growing popularity of broadband Internet access. Correspondingly, high-speed TCP variations, such as BIT-TCP, have been deployed to accommodate faster link speeds. BIT-TCP, introduced as the default TCP implementation in Linux 2.6.8 in 2004 [16], accelerates the growth of the congestion window, thereby mitigating under-utilization problems for high-speed and long-distance paths.

### Dataset Similarity

Given the significant similarities across our seven datasets, as evidenced by the closely aligned thick lines in Figure 1, we quantify the similarity between two datasets by detecting flows with the same unordered pair (IP1/24, IP2/24), preserving only the 24-bit prefix. The Similarity Index (SI) between datasets X and Y is defined as \( SI_{X,Y} = \frac{|\Omega(X) \cap \Omega(Y)|}{\max\{|\Omega(X)|, |\Omega(Y)|\}} \), where \(\Omega(X)\) denotes the set of unordered (IP1/24, IP2/24) pairs of all flows in X. We find that the similarity index for any pair of datasets is less than 33%, indicating that our datasets are reasonably heterogeneous.

### Heavy-Hitter Flows

Next, we examine heavy-hitter flows and compare our results with a recent study analyzing traces of a regional network and Abilene OC48 backbone link collected in April 2003 and August 2002, respectively [10]. This study finds strong correlations among some combinations of size, rate, and burstiness, explained using transport and application-level protocol mechanisms. Four types of heavy-hitter flows are identified: elephant, tortoise, cheetah, and porcupine, corresponding to flows with size, duration, rate, and burstiness greater than the mean plus three standard deviations of the respective measurement. Specifically, the burstiness of a flow is calculated by multiplying the average burst rate by the average inter-burst time, where a burst consists of a train of packets with inter-arrival times less than 1ms. Only bursts with more than one packet are considered. As shown in Table 2, although the number of heavy-hitter flows is very small (except for porcupine flows), they contribute significantly to the traffic volume.

### Distributions of Heavy-Hitter Flows

Figure 2 illustrates the distributions of size, rate, and burstiness for the four types of heavy-hitter flows in the BU trace (thick curves with labels). We did not present the duration distribution due to the bias introduced by the limited duration of the BU trace (30min vs 2hr). Our observations show qualitatively similar distributions compared to other datasets, with key findings highlighted below.

- **Elephant, Cheetah, and Tortoise Flows**: The sizes of these flows have increased by about an order of magnitude. Since most are HTTP data flows with the source port 80, this increase is likely due to larger file sizes on web servers and the trend of using HTTP to transfer large multimedia data. The growth in file size in both local and network file systems is well-documented by previous measurements [4, 20].
- **Rate of Elephant and Tortoise Flows**: The rate of elephant flows, which contribute to at least half of the traffic volume, and that of tortoise flows, has increased by one order of magnitude compared to Lan's study [10]. This is likely due to the significant growth in link speed within both core and edge networks.
- **Burstiness**: The most striking difference is in burstiness. As shown in Table 2, the very small number of porcupines contributes to less than 1.5% of the traffic volume, providing a sharp contrast to [10]. Additionally, the size and rate of porcupine flows differ significantly from previous studies: there is an increase in rate but a decrease in size. In Figure 2(c), the burstiness of heavy-hitter flows also deviates significantly from Lan's study, warranting further investigation.

### Correlation Analysis

Similar to [35] and [10], we observe correlations between duration, rate, and size. For each dataset, the correlation coefficient between (logS, logR) ranges from 0.54 to 0.57, which is smaller than the values observed in [35] and [10]. The (logR, logD) shows a stronger negative correlation ranging from -0.69 to -0.60. (logS, logD) are slightly positively correlated with a correlation coefficient between 0.21 and 0.40.

### Summary of Findings

In summary, we observe a significant increase in the average flow rate. Specifically, the rate of elephant flows has increased by a factor of 10 compared to six years ago. Additionally, the sizes of elephant, cheetah, and tortoise flows have increased by an order of magnitude. These observations indicate the trend of upgrading Internet infrastructure at the core and edge, the deployment of new TCP variants, and the trend of using TCP to transfer larger content such as video streaming and long-time online gaming.

### New Methods for Flow Analysis

In this section, we present three new algorithms for analyzing unidirectional TCP flows. As discussed earlier, we focus on long-lived flows, which contribute significantly more traffic volume compared to short-lived ones. A key challenge in analyzing unidirectional flows is the lack of information needed to reconstruct TCP states at both the sender and receiver sides. For example, if there is no pronounced flow clock or the flow clock does not originate from the transport layer (RTT), it is challenging to accurately estimate RTT. To overcome this difficulty, in §4.2 and §4.3, we adopt statistical approaches that require observing enough packets to infer certain properties with sufficient accuracy and high confidence. These approaches are fundamentally different from existing deterministic methods.
