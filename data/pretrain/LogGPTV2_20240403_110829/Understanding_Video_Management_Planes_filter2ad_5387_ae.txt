Finally, while [22] does presents some trends with respect to device
usage, other dimensions are not considered. In addition, we go
249
beyond all these reports by considering the implications of these
trends for management complexity, and syndicated content.
Quantifying diversity and complexity. Prior work has captured
diversity of mobile users [60] and apps [74] and the complexity of
web pages [51] and routers [50]. While we draw inspiration from
these works, our focus is on video management planes, a different
domain.
8 CONCLUSION
The Internet video management plane, which is responsible for
packaging video content and for ensuring playback across differ-
ent devices, has received relatively little research attention. Using
data collected by Conviva, a streaming TV measurement and intelli-
gence platform, over a period of two years from over one hundred
video publishers, we find that there exists significant diversity across
the three aspects of video management we study (packaging, CDN
usage, and playback device usage): large publishers support 3-4
protocols, 5 CDNs and 5 different device types. This diversity adds
complexity to several management tasks such as failure triaging, soft-
ware management, and encoding. We find that complexity metrics
for these tasks are sub-linearly related to the number of view-hours.
Finally, the structure of today’s management planes can lead to
variable delivery performance for syndicated content. Integrating
management planes for syndicated content can avoid this as well as
reduce CDN origin server storage requirements, and future work can
explore mechanisms for integrated syndication, as well as analyze
new complexity metrics, and approaches to cope with diversity and
reduce management complexity.
