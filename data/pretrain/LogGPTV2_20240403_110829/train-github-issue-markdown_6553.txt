I am new to Julia and have encountered the following message:

```
INFO: Recompiling stale cache file /Users/.../.julia/lib/v0.5/Atom.ji for module Atom.

I am using macOS 10.10.5 and the atom-juno package. To resolve this issue, I need to delete the contents of the `.julia/lib/` directory, which is quite inconvenient.

Below, I provide a detailed description of the problem and the workaround I have used:
