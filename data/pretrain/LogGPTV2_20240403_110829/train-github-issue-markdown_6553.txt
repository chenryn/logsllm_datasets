New to Julia. I get this message:
    INFO: Recompiling stale cache file /Users/.../.julia/lib/v0.5/Atom.ji for module Atom.
I'm on MacOS 10.10.5. I use atom-juno. I have to delete the `.julia/lib/`
directory content to fix the problem. A tad inconvenient. Below describes
problem and workaround.

This is probably a duplicate, but there are 1,858 open issues and couldn't
find a similar one in finite time.
