Logging and auditing are required for any organization from a compliance and governance
point of view. If your organization operates in one of the highly regulated industries such
as banking, financial services, healthcare, and so on, then it must go through frequent
security audits in order to maintain compliance with industry regulations. These audits can
be internal or external depending on the nature of your business.
We learnt in the previous chapters that security of the IT environment is a shared
responsibility between AWS and its customers. While AWS is responsible for maintaining
security of resources, tools, services, and features available in the AWS cloud, the customer
is responsible for configuring security for all these services and the security of their data.
AWS communicates information related to security with customers periodically by taking
the following steps:
Obtaining industry standard certifications
By third party audits and attestations
Publishing white papers and content about the security infrastructure
Providing audit certifications and other regulatory compliance documents to
customers
Logging refers to recording activities for your resources. A log data from your resource is
required to understand the state of your resource at a given point in time and also for
communications and data transfer to and from your resource. Logging also enables you to
diagnose and mitigate any issue either reported, discovered, or expected for a resource or
multiple resources in your system. This logged data is generally stored in a separate storage
device and is used for auditing, forensics, and compliance purposes as well. Logged data is
often used long after the resource that generated the log data is terminated. Logging is a
reactive security measure.
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 184 ]
Each AWS service provides log data in the form of log files, this data is used to get
information about the performance of this service. Moreover, many AWS services provide
security log data that has information about access, billing, configuration changes, and so
on. These log files are used for auditing, governance, compliance, risk management, and so
on.
AWS provides you with a fully managed service AWS CloudTrail to log and audit all
activities in your account. This includes operational auditing and risk auditing as well.
Furthermore, you can use AWS-managed services such as Amazon S3, Amazon
CloudWatch, Amazon ElasticSearch, and so on to create a centralized logging solution to
get a comprehensive view of your IT environment, including all resources, applications,
and users.
AWS has one the most effective and longest running customer compliance program
available today in the cloud market. AWS enables its customers and partners to manage
security controls in the cloud with the help of compliance tooling's largest and most diverse
compliance footprint. All these features together allow; AWS customers and partners to
work with their auditors by providing all the evidence required for effective control of IT
operations and security and data protection in the cloud.
A secured cloud environment is a compliant cloud environment. AWS offers you a cloud-
based governance for your environment with a number of advantages, such as a lower cost
of entry, configurable and secure operations, agility, a holistic view of your entire IT
environment, security controls, governance enabled features, and central automation. While
using AWS, you inherit all the security controls operated by AWS, thereby reducing your
overhead on deploying and maintaining these security controls yourselves.
In this chapter, we will learn about logging, auditing, risks, and governance in the AWS
cloud and how they are integrated with each other. We will begin with understanding
logging in AWS, how logging works for various AWS services in AWS and what tools and
services are available to work with log data of different shapes and sizes generated from a
myriad of resources in your IT environment. While going through logging, we'll learn about
the following:

Next, we will learn about AWS CloudTrail, a fully managed audit service that logs all API
activities in your AWS account. This service is at the heart of governance, logging, and
auditing in AWS along with AWS CloudWatch Logs. It also helps with compliance and risk
monitoring activities. We will learn about CloudTrail concepts before moving on to deep
dive in to features and use cases of AWS CloudTrail. Moreover, we will learn how to have
security at scale through logging in AWS and best practices for AWS CloudTrail.
Moving on, we will walk through auditing in AWS. We will walk through the following
resources provided by AWS:
AWS Compliance Center
AWS Auditor Learning Path
AWS has many resources to audit usage of AWS services. We will walk through a fully
managed service AWS Artifact to obtain all security and compliance related documents.
Furthermore, we will learn how we can use the following AWS services for risk,
compliance, and governance in the AWS cloud in a variety of ways:
AWS Config
AWS Service Catalog
AWS Trusted Advisor
We will wrap up the auditing section by going through the following auditing checklist and
learning about other available resources for auditing AWS resources:

Logging in AWS
AWS has a complete suite of services to cater to all your logging needs for adhering to your
security and operational best practices, as well as meeting your compliance and regulatory
requirements. So, you have all the logs that you need to capture, with storage, monitoring,
and analyzing facilities available in AWS, keeping the dynamic nature of cloud computing.
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 186 ]
To begin, let us look at various logs available in AWS. All the logs in AWS can be classified
into three categories, as shown in the following table: 
AWS infrastructure logs AWS service logs
Host-based logs
AWS CloudTrail
Amazon S3
Messages
AWS VPC flow logs
AWS ELB
IIS/Apache
Amazon CloudFront Windows Event logs
AWS Lambda
Custom logs
 Table 1 - AWS logs classiÔ¨Åcation
AWS infrastructure logs, such as CloudTrail Logs, contain information related to all API
activity in your AWS account, while VPC flow logs contain information regarding your IP
traffic flowing in and out of your VPC.
AWS service logs include logs from miscellaneous AWS services that contain information
such as security log data, service access information, changes related to configuration and
state, billing events, and so on.
Host-based logs are generated by the operating system of EC2 instances, such as Apache,
IIS, and so on. Applications running on AWS services or custom logs are generated by web
servers.
All of these logs generated by various sources will have a different format, size, frequency,
and information. AWS provides you with services and solutions to effectively manage,
store, access, analyze, and monitor these logs.
AWS native security logging capabilities
Let us look at the best practices for working with log files and native AWS Security logging
capabilities for some of the foundation and most common AWS services.

Best practices
Let us look at best practices for logging:
You should always log access and audit information for all your resources
Ensure that all your log data is secured with access control and stored in a
durable storage solution such as S3, as shown in the following figure
Use lifecycle policies to automate storage, archiving, and deletion of your log
data
Follow standard naming conventions for your log data
Use centralized log monitoring solutions to consolidate all your log data from all
sources, analyze it, and create actionable alerts out of this log data
Figure 1 - AWS access logging S3
AWS CloudTrail
AWS CloudTrail is an audit service that records all API calls made to your AWS account.
You can use this log data to track user activity and API usage in your AWS account. This
service should be enabled for your AWS account to collect data for all regions irrespective
of the location of your resources. This service stores historical data for the last seven days,
you need to store this data in an S3 bucket in order to store it for a longer duration. This
service integrates seamlessly with AWS CloudWatch Logs and AWS Lambda to create a log
monitoring and processing solution. We will deep dive into AWS CloudTrail later in this
chapter.
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 188 ]
AWS Config
AWS Config service records the configurations of all AWS resources in your AWS account.
It is used to audit changes to the resource configuration as it provides a timeline of such
changes for specific AWS services. It uses S3 to store snapshots of all such changes so that
your data is stored securely in a durable, access controlled storage. AWS Config integrates
with Simple Notification Service (SNS) to configure the notification to users when changes
are made to a resource. This service enables you to demonstrate compliance at a given point
in time or during a period. We will look at AWS Config in detail later in this chapter.
AWS detailed billing reports
You have the option, to break down your billing report by month, day, or by an hour; by a
product, such as EC2, or by a resource, such as a specific EC2 instance or specific S3 bucket;
or by tags assigned to your resources. These detailed billing reports are used to analyze
usage and audit consumption of AWS resources in your account. These detailed billing
reports are provided multiple times in a day to the S3 bucket of your choice. Always
allocate meaningful tags for your resources to allocate the cost to these AWS resources
based on their cost centers, departments, projects, and so on. Detailed billing reports help
you improve cost analysis, resource optimization, and billing reconciliation processes.
Amazon S3 Access Logs
S3 logs all the requests made to individual S3 buckets when you have enabled the logging
option for an S3 bucket. This access log stores all information about access requests, such as
requester, bucket name, request time, error log, and so on. You can use this information for
your security audits including failed access attempts for your S3 buckets. It will also help
you understand the usage of objects in and across your S3 buckets and traffic patterns along
with mapping your AWS S3 charges with S3 usage. We will look at server access logging
for S3 buckets later in this section.
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 189 ]
ELB Logs
ELB provides access logs with detailed information for all requests and connections sent to
your load balancers. ELB publishes a log file in five minute intervals for every load balancer
node once you enable this feature. This log file contains information such as client IP
address, latency, server response, and so on. This information can be used for security and
access analysis to ensure you are not getting traffic from unauthorized sources. You can also
use latency and request time information to detect degradation in performance and take
actions required to improve the user experience. Alternatively, these logs provide an
external view of your application's performance. You can configure an S3 bucket to store
these logs. The following figure shows the logging process for Amazon ELB:
Figure 2 - Amazon ELB logging
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 190 ]
Amazon CloudFront Access Logs
Amazon CloudFront can be configured to generate access logs. These logs are delivered
multiple times an hour to an S3 bucket that you specify for saving this log data. These logs
provide information about every user request made to CloudFront distributions just like S3
access logs and ELB access logs. Similarly, this log data can be used for security and access
audits for all your users accessing content throughout your content delivery network. You
can use this data to verify if your content delivery network is performing as per your
expectation. You can check latency of content delivered along with delivery errors and take
required actions based on log data. The following figure shows how logging works for
Amazon CloudFront:
Figure 3 - Amazon CloudFront logging
Amazon RDS Logs
These logs store information such as performance, access, and errors for your RDS
databases. You can view, download, and watch these logs from the AWS Management
Console, CLI, or through Amazon RDS APIs. You can also query these log files through
database tables specific to your database engine. You can use these log files for security,
performance, access, and operational analysis of your managed database in RDS. You
should have an automated process to transfer your log files to a centralized access log
repository such as S3 or Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

[ 191 ]
Amazon VPC Flow Logs
VPC flow logs capture all information about all IP traffic flowing in and out of your VPC
network interfaces. You can enable flow logs for a VPC, a subnet, or even at a single Elastic
Network Interface (ENI). This log data is stored and viewed in the CloudWatch Logs. It can
also be exported for advanced analytics. This log data can be used for auditing, debugging,
or when you are required to capture and analyze network flow data for security or
regulatory purposes. You can troubleshoot all scenarios when your traffic is not reaching its
expected destination with the help of VPC flow logs. The following figure shows VPC flow
logs being published to the Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store log data in multiple log
streams under one log group:
Figure 4 - Amazon VPC Ô¨Çow logs

[ 192 ]
AWS CloudWatch Logs
AWS CloudWatch Logs is a monitoring, logging, and log storage feature available as part of
the AWS CloudWatch service. You can consume logs from resources in any AWS region;
however, you can view logs in the CloudWatch for regions where CloudWatch Logs are
supported. Your log data can be encrypted using KMS at the log group level. CloudWatch
Logs are primarily used for performing the following tasks:
Monitoring all your logs in near real-time by routing them to the AWS
CloudWatch Logs; these could be your operating system logs, application logs,
AWS service logs, or AWS infrastructure logs such as VPC flow logs and AWS
CloudTrail Logs
Storing all your logs in a durable storage with configurable retention period
Generating logs for your EC2 instances by installing the CloudWatch Logs agent
on your EC2 instances
Integrated with AWS services such as AWS CloudWatch for creating metrics and
alerts, AWS IAM for secure access to logs and AWS CloudTrail for recording all
API activities for AWS CloudWatch Logs in your AWS account
CloudWatch Logs concepts
Let us now look at the following core concepts of AWS CloudWatch Logs to understand it
better:
Log events: Records of any activity captured by the application or resource that is
being logged. A log event contains the timestamp and event message in UTF-8
format.
Log streams: A sequence of log events from the same source being logged such as
an application or an EC2 instance.
Log group: A group of multiple log streams that share the same properties such
as retention period, policies, access control, and so on. Each log stream is part of a
log group. These log groups can be tagged as well.
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 193 ]
Metric filters: A metric filter is used to extract metrics out of the log data that is
ingested by the CloudWatch Logs. A metric filter is assigned to a log group, and
this filter is assigned to all log streams of that log group. You can have more than
one metric filter for a log group.
Retention policies: You define retention policies for storing your log data in
CloudWatch Logs. These policies are assigned to log groups and log streams
belonging to that log group. Log data is automatically deleted once it is expired.
By default, log data is stored indefinitely. You can set up a retention period of 1
day to 10 years.
Log agent: You need to install a CloudWatch log agent in your EC2 instances to
send log data to CloudWatch Logs automatically. An agent contains the 
following components:
A plug-in to CLI to push log data to CloudWatch Logs
A script to start pushing data to CloudWatch Logs
A cron job to check that script is running as per schedule
The following figure shows four log groups available under CloudWatch Logs in the AWS
CloudWatch console. It also shows Metric Filters available for one of the log groups
containing 2 filters. Moreover, it shows that retention policies are not set up for any log
group, hence log events are set to Never Expire:
Figure 5 - AWS CloudWatch Logs
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 194 ]
The following figure shows log streams for a log group in the AWS CloudWatch console.
You can filter log streams based on text data. You can also create a custom log stream and
you also have an option to delete log streams:
Figure 6 - AWS CloudWatch Log streams
The following figure shows event logs for a log stream in a log group. You can filter events
based on text or phrases such as error or access denied. Note that events contain such
information along with a timestamp, as shown in the following figure. You can view
information for the past 30 seconds up to the time when the event was first logged, as
shown in the following figure:
Figure 7 - AWS CloudWatch events log
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 195 ]
CloudWatch Logs limits
Let us look at limits of CloudWatch Logs:
A batch can have a maximum size of 1 MB
5 GB of data archiving is free
An event can have a maximum size of 256 KB
You can get 10 requests for log events per second, per account, per region
5 GB of incoming data is free
You can have up to 5,000 log groups per account, per region. This is a soft limit
and can be increased by contacting AWS support
You can have up to 100 metric filters for every log group
You can have one subscription filter per log group
Lifecycle of CloudWatch Logs
A typical CloudWatch Logs lifecycle begins by installing a log agent on an EC2 instance.
This agent will publish data to the CloudWatch Logs, where it will be part of a log stream in
a log group. This log stream will process events data using filters and metrics will be
created for this log data. Additionally, this log group can have subscriptions to process this
log data in real time.
Logging and Auditing in AWS
[ 196 ]
The following figure shows the lifecycle where logs are published by the CloudWatch Log
agent to the CloudWatch Logs from various EC2 instances inside a VPC. Log agent is
installed in all these EC2 instances. CloudWatch Logs will process these multiple logs and
create CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and notifications for these logs:
Figure 8 - AWS CloudWatch Log agent lifecycle
Alternatively, CloudWatch Logs will have one or multiple logs published by various other
sources apart from the CloudWatch Log agent, such as AWS Lambda, Elastic Load
Balancer, S3 buckets and so on. It will monitor, process, and store all such logs in a similar
fashion as previously described. 
Following figure shows logs from the ELB stored in the S3 bucket. Whenever a log arrives
from the ELB in the S3 bucket, this buckets sends an event notification that invokes an AWS
Lambda function. This AWS Lambda function reads this log data and publishes it to the
CloudWatch Logs for further processing:
Figure 9 - AWS CloudWatch Logs lifecycle

[ 197 ]
AWS CloudTrail
AWS CloudTrail is a fully managed audit service that captures all API activities in the form
of event history in your AWS account for all resources. Simply put, all actions performed by
a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events by this service. This includes API calls
made from the AWS Management Console, CLI tools, SDKs, APIs, and other AWS services.
It stores this information in log files. These logs files can be delivered to S3 for durable
storage. AWS CloudTrail enables compliance, governance, risk auditing, and operational
auditing of your AWS account. This event history is used for security analysis, tracking
changes for your resources, analyzing user activity, demonstrating compliance, and various
other scenarios that require visibility in your account activities.
AWS CloudTrail is enabled by default for all AWS accounts. It shows seven days of event
history by default for the current region that you are viewing. In order to view the event
history for more than seven days for all the AWS regions, you need to enable and set up a
CloudTrail. You can view, search, and download this event data for further analysis. These
log files are encrypted by default. These log files are delivered within 15 minutes of any
activity occurring in your AWS account. They are published by AWS CloudTrail
approximately every five minutes.
The following flow diagram shows typical lifecycle for CloudTrail events in five steps:
Account activity occurs.
