User: Is there a standard way to make sure a python script will be interpreted by python2 and not python3? On my distro, I can use #!/usr/bin/env python2 as the shebang, but it seems not all distros ship "python2". I could explicitly call a specific version (eg. 2.6) of python, but that would rule out people who don't have that version.
It seems to me that this is going to be increasingly a problem when distros will start putting python3 as the default python interpreter.
Assistant: Depends on how you're distributing it, I guess.
If you're using a normal setup.py file to manage your distribution, have it bomb out if the user is trying to install it in Python 3. 
Once it's installed, the shebang of the console script created by (say) setuptools will likely be linked to the specific interpreter used to install it.
If you're doing something weird for your installation, you can in whatever installation script you're using look for python interpreters and store a choice. You might first check whether whatever is called "python" is a 2.x. If not, check for "python2.7", "python2.6", etc to see what's available.
