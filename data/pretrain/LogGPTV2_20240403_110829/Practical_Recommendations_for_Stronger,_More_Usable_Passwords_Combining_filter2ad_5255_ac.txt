results lead us to conclude that while a ciss blocklist matching algo-
rithm can provide strong security against guessing attacks, it also
may severely harm password-creation usability if used alongside a
wordlist as large as or larger than the Xato wordlist.
Besides Xato-based blocklists, we tested a blocklist configuration
that used fs matching with the much larger Pwned wordlist. We
found that 1c8+Pwned-fs and 1c8+Xato-strip-cifs led to passwords
of similar strength, both in terms of overall password strength and
in terms of resistance to online and offline guessing attacks. Par-
ticipants also reported similar usability during password creation.
Although 1c8+Xato-strip-cifs participants were much more likely to
report noticing a password they wanted to create being rejected by
the blocklist requirement than 1c8+Pwned-fs participants (FET: 50%
vs. 23% noticed), they did not take substantially longer to create
their password nor report more difficulty or annoyance. Thus, we
conclude that blocklists that perform fs checking against the Pwned
wordlist can provide comparable protections against guessing at-
tacks and similar usability compared to blocklists that perform
strip-cifs checking against the Xato wordlist.
4.3 RQ3: Composition requirements for
min-strength policies
We examined whether certain combinations of minimum-strength
and composition requirements would lead to stronger or easier-to-
create passwords. As we had hypothesized that a NN6 requirement
