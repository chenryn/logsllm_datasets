2 · 150) m. Note that in the case of this method the
least (200 +
accuracy is independent from the value of c. It only depends on the
difference between rad R and rad I, which in turns depends on the
2·s/2,
length s of the side of the region: if the difference is at least
then the condition is satisﬁed (for every possible x) with probability
1. Otherwise, there will be some x for which the condition is not
satisﬁed (i.e., it is satisﬁed with probability 0).


In the case of our method, on the other hand, the accuracy con-
dition depends on c and on . More precisely, as we have seen in
(c) ≤
previous section, the condition is satisﬁed if and only if C−1
rad R − rad I. Therefore, for ﬁxed c, the maximum  only depends
on the difference between rad R and rad I and is determined by the
(c) = rad R − rad I. For the above values of rad I,
equation C−1
rad R, and c, it turns out that  = 0.016.
We can now compare the LP of the two mechanisms with respect
to the three priors above. Figure 13 illustrates the results. As we
can see, our mechanism outperforms the cloaking mechanism in all
the three cases.
√
For different values of rad I the situation does not change: as
explained above, the cloaking method always forces rad R to be
2 · 150 m, and  only depends
larger than rad I by (at least)
on this value. For smaller values of c, on the contrary, the situa-
tion changes, and becomes more favorable for our method. In fact,
as argued above, the situation remains the same for the cloacking
method (since its accuracy does not depend on c), while  decreases
(and consequently LP increases) as c decreases. In fact, for a ﬁxed
r = rad R − rad I, we have  = C−1
r (c). This follows from
r = C−1
(c) and from the fact that r and , in the expression that
deﬁnes C(r), are interchangeable.

7. RELATED WORK
Much of the related work has been already discussed in Sec-
tion 2, here we only mention the works that were not reported there.
There are excellent works and surveys [37, 26, 34] that summarize
the different threats, methods, and guarantees in the context of lo-
cation privacy.
LISA [9] provides location privacy by preventing an attacker
from relating any particular point of interest (POI) to the user’s lo-

that one for all the mechanisms. We ﬁnd that in order to obtain
such SQL for our mechanism we need to set  = 0.0162 (the dif-
ference with (cid:48) in this case is negligible). The mechanism of [36]
is generated by using the tool explained in the same paper.
Figure 11 illustrates the priors that we consider here:
in each
case, the probability distribution is accumulated in the regions in
the purple area, and distributed uniformly over them. Note that it is
not interesting to consider the uniform distribution over the whole
map, since, as explained before, on that prior all the mechanisms
under consideration give the same result.
Figure 12 illustrates the results we obtain in terms of LP, where
(a), (b) and (c) correspond to the priors in Figure 11. The optimal
mechanism is considered in two instances: the one designed ex-
actly for the prior for which it is used (“optimal-rp”, where “rp”
stands for real prior), and the one designed for the uniform dis-
tribution on all the map (“optimal-unif”, which is not necessarily
optimal for the priors considered here). As we can see, the Pla-
nar Laplace mechanism offers the best LP among the mechanisms
which do not depend on the prior, or, as in the case of optimal-unif,
are designed with a ﬁxed prior. When the prior has a more circular
symmetry the performance approaches the one of optimal-rp (the
optimal mechanism).
Comparing the LP for a given accuracy.
The SQL metric deﬁned above is a reasonable metric, but it does
not cover all natural notions of quality of service. In particular, in
the case of LBSs, an important criterion to take into account is the
additional bandwidth usage. Therefore, we make now a compari-
son using the notion of accuracy, which, as explained in previous
section, provides a good criterion to evaluate the performance in
terms of bandwidth. Unfortunately we cannot compare our mech-
anism to the one of [36] under this criterion, because the construc-
tion of the latter is tied to the SQL. Hence, we only compare our
mechanism with the cloaking one.
We recall that an LBS application (K, rad R) is (c, rad I )-accurate
if for every location x the probability that the area of interest (AOI)
is fully contained in the area of retrieval (AOR) is at least c. We
need to ﬁx rad I (the radius of the AOI), rad R (the radius of the

cation. That way, the attacker cannot infer which POI the user will
visit next. The privacy metric used in this work is m-unobservability.
The method achieves m-unobservability if, with high probability,
the attacker cannot relate the estimated location to at least m dif-
ferent POIs in the proximity.
SpaceTwist [39] reports a fake location (called the “anchor”) and
queries the geolocation system server incrementally for the nearest
neighbors of this fake location until the k-nearest neighbors of the
real location are obtained.
In a recent paper [29] it has been shown that, due to ﬁnite preci-
sion and rounding effects of ﬂoating-point operations, the standard
implementations of the Laplacian mechanism result in an irregu-
lar distribution which causes the loss of the property of differential
privacy. In [18] the study has been extended to the planar Lapla-
cian, and to any kind of ﬁnite-precision semantics. The same paper
proposes a solutions for the truncated version of the planar lapla-
cian, based on a snapping meccanism, which maintains the level of
privacy at the cost of introducing an additional amount of noise.
8. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we have presented a framework for achieving pri-
vacy in location-based applications, taking into account the desired
level of protection as well as the side-information that the attacker
might have. The core of our proposal is a new notion of privacy,
that we call geo-indistinguishability, and a method, based on a bi-
variate version of the Laplace function, to perturbate the actual
location. We have put a strong emphasis in the formal treatment
of the privacy guarantees, both in giving a rigorous deﬁnition of
geo-indistinguishability, and in providing a mathematical proof that
our method satisﬁes such property. We also have shown how geo-
indistinguishability relates to the popular notion of differential pri-
vacy. Finally, we have illustrated the applicability of our method on
a POI-retrieval service, and we have compared it with other mecha-
nisms in the literature, showing that it outperforms those which do
not depend on the prior.
In the future we aim at extending our method to cope with more
complex applications, possibly involving the sanitization of several
(potentially related) locations. One important aspect to consider
when generating noise on several data is the fact that their corre-
lation may degrade the level of protection. We aim at devising
techniques to control the possible loss of privacy and to allow the
composability of our method.
