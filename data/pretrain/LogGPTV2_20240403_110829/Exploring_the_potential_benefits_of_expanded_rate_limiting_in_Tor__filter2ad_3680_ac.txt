### Bandwidth Improvements in Tortoise

#### Figure 5: Bandwidth Improvements
**Description:**
- **Tortoise, not running relays:** Clients that do not run relays.
- **Tortoise, running relays:** Clients that choose to run routers.
- **Y-axis:** Bandwidth (KBps)
- **X-axis:** Number of clients who choose to run routers.

**Observations:**
- The experiments in the two graphs differ only in the number of clients who choose to run routers.
- Clients that run relays experience significant bandwidth improvements.

**Graphs:**
- **0 KBps, 50 KBps, 100 KBps, 150 KBps, 200 KBps, 250 KBps**

#### Figure 6: Average Bandwidth with Additional Relays
**Description:**
- **Average bandwidth (KBps):** Bandwidth seen by all clients in an unmodified network and unmodified networks with additional client relays.
- **Y-axis:** Average bandwidth (KBps)
- **X-axis:** Different scenarios (15 relays, 15 relays + 20 client relays, 15 relays + 40 client relays, no rate limit, no extra relays)

**Observations:**
- Adding more client relays increases the average bandwidth for all clients.

**Graphs:**
- **20 KBps, 40 KBps, 60 KBps, 80 KBps, 100 KBps, 120 KBps**

### Supporting Bridges in Tortoise

**Challenges:**
- Bridges are not listed in Tor directories, making them subject to universal rate limits.
- We propose two methods to better support bridges:
  1. **Circuit Extension Method:**
     - A relay uses a separate bridge to attempt to create a Tor circuit through the node in question.
     - If the circuit is successfully extended, the node is a bridge; otherwise, it is a client.
     - This method requires slight modifications to allow bridges to extend circuits to other bridges.
   2. **Trusted Relay Method:**
     - Bridges use independently-chosen trusted relays that are aware of their status and exempt them from rate limits.
     - Clients must select a second hop (trusted relay) that is not subject to rate limiting.

### Ensuring Accurate Directories

**Challenges:**
- Only relays marked as STABLE and FAST in the Tor directory are exempt from Tortoise’s universal rate limit.
- Dishonest clients may report false high bandwidths to gain the FAST rating.
- Recent techniques to avoid reliance on self-reported capacities include:
  - **Opportunistic Measurement System:** Relays report observed bandwidth of peers, and directory servers advertise the median [28].
  - **Empirical Measurements:** Measurement authorities perform empirical measurements of relays’ bandwidths [24].

**Proposed Refinement:**
- Apply a rate limit on relays based on the amount of bandwidth they provide to the network.
- Improvement in client bandwidth will be proportional to the amount of bandwidth the client’s OR serves the network.

### Sybil-Style Attacks

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Clients can achieve high bandwidth by multiplexing connections over many Tor circuits.
- Existing countermeasures include requiring clients to complete periodic cryptopuzzles to continuously forward their traffic.
- This approach aims to shift incentives to better motivate compliance with Tortoise’s envisioned model.

### Related Work

**Prioritizing Techniques:**
- **Tang and Goldberg's Proposal:** Replace Tor’s round-robin circuit scheduler with one that considers a circuit’s recent usage using the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) [29].
- This technique favors bursty circuits, potentially improving overall performance.

This structured and coherent presentation should help in clearly conveying the information and observations from the figures and the proposed methods.
