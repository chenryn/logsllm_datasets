spun articles appear mechanically spun, as the sentences read
awkwardly or have semantic deﬁciencies. Other articles appear
to have beneﬁted from human intervention, as the sentences
read smoothly and are meaningful. We consider the problem
of classifying spun content into machine and human categories
to be an interesting challenge for future work.
C. Cluster Sizes
SEO folklore holds that the more backlinks a promoted
page has, the more effective the SEO campaign. Next we
measure the scale at which spammers post spun content, pre-
sumably reﬂecting the scale at which they perceive backlinks
are necessary for effective SEO. In particular, we look at the
distribution of cluster sizes for both the wiki data set and the
GoArticles data set, shown in Figures 7 and 8. Each cluster
represents the set of spun pages generated from a given source
page. We ﬁnd a total of 12, 783 clusters from the wiki data set
compared with 27, 141 clusters from the GoArticles data set.
Even though the wiki data set has more spun pages, it has
fewer clusters. This results from more spun pages per cluster.
From Figure 7, a majority of spun pages resides in clusters
of size 600 pages or less for the wiki data set. But most clusters
are small: over 80% of the clusters have nine postings or
fewer. And as a single site, cluster sizes are even smaller on

three pages or less.
D. Content
If spinning campaigns manipulate a promoted page’s rank
via backlinks from spun pages with seemingly viable, non-
duplicated content, understanding the content of such spun
pages can indicate the afﬁliations of spun pages. To this end,
we calculate word frequencies on spun content found in the
GoArticles and wiki data sets. We extract frequent words, and
then remove any words that are not a noun, a verb, or an object.
Table III shows the top ten topical words, where a topical word
suggests the topic of an article.
Overall, most of the popular words appear to relate to sales
and services, some to particular markets (automobile, weight
loss). This is no surprise since a major incentive to increasing
a page’s search rank would be to encourage more trafﬁc to a
Web site and increase sales opportunities.
E. Domains
Next we characterize the relationship between spun articles
and domains. If spammers post spun articles on pages within a
single domain, then the total set size considered for duplicate
detection algorithms would be greatly reduced. However, if
spammers post spun pages across many domains, then detec-
tion techniques would have to account for this behavior. We
evaluate this relationship for the wiki data set as all pages from
the GoArticles data set exist in the same domain.

F. Timing
This section examines spammer behaviour in terms of the
rate and duration at which spammers post spun articles during
a spinning campaign. It is possible that spammers may want
to post spun content over a longer duration of days, so as to
avoid raising suspicion about a rapid deluge of spun content.
However, a long-term spamming campaign may not be as
effective for SEO as a short-term one. We ﬁrst describe how
we scrape the timing information for each spinning campaign
in the two data sets, and then discuss the results.
1) Wiki: Most wiki pages contain a last modiﬁed tag, and
we use this tag to extract the time of post. However, the
tag text itself does not have a uniform template, and many
are in languages other than English. We scrape this ﬁeld
and use regular expressions to parse the date for common
templates in most languages. Some pages contain either no
timing information or a language not supported by the parser.
After we cluster pages of spun content, we parse 145, 885
pages out of 225, 070 that contain timing information. We ﬁnd
the minimum and maximum date in each cluster to compute
the duration in days for each spam campaign.
Figure 12 shows a CDF of the duration in days of the
spinning-based spam campaigns in the wiki data set. Nearly

Fig. 10. Number of pages per cluster versus number of domains per cluster
for the wiki data set.
1) Spun Content Across Domains: We map each page to
its domain, and compute the number of distinct domains that
appear within each cluster. Figure 9 displays a CDF of the
number of domains per cluster. The CDF shows that although
some clusters contain only one domain, the average cluster
spans across 12 ± 27 domains, with some clusters spanning
across as many as 228 domains. This result provides evidence
that spammers target multiple domains when posting spun
content, instead of a single site.
Further, Figure 10 shows the relationship between the
number of domains in a cluster and the number of pages in the
cluster. It indicates a strong, positive correlation between larger
scale spinning campaigns and a larger number of targeted
domains. For instance, the largest spinning campaign that spans
only a single domain has 44 pages, while the largest spinning
campaign that spans 228 domains contains 716 pages.
2) Spun Content per Domain: Spammers may target some
domains more heavily than others, for numerous reasons. In
Figure 11 we calculate the percentage of spun content per
domain, for all domains that contain spun content. For each
domain, we normalize the quantity of spun content to the total
number of pages from that domain. The bulk of the distribution
are when domains have 15%–65% spun content, showing that,
when a wiki is targeted for spamming, it is targeted heavily.

75% of these campaigns last for less than a day. These results
conﬁrm intuition. When spammers use automated tools to
post spun content, it is a short-term interactive process. Given
these results, the timing behavior of these campaigns might
be a useful additional feature in clustering spun pages into a
campaign, although we have yet to explore it.
2) GoArticles: Since all the pages in the GoArticles data
set are from a single site, extracting their post
times is
straightforward. Figure 13 shows a CDF of the duration in
days of the spinning-based spam clusters in the set. The time
scales are substantially longer than the wiki data set. More than
40% of the clusters have durations of at least a week, and 20%
were a month.
One explanation for these long durations is that the clusters
we are identifying are not actually from the same spam
campaign. For the most part, the pages in a cluster are related
by spinning, but either one of the pages was used as a seed, or
the GoArticles site was spammed at different times by different
campaigns (perhaps sharing a seed page from another site).
G. Backlinks
A spinning campaign may contain backlinks to promote a
site through black hat SEO. There are two general strategies
to backlinking used by campaigns. In one strategy, spammers
can place the same backlink on every spun page. Here it
is straightforward to conﬁrm that pages belong to the same
campaign by verifying that they promote the same site. How-
ever, there is another strategy, where spammers create spinning
campaigns with backlinks pointing to a variety of sites to
hinder spamming detection and prevent penalization of the
search engine ranking of a single monetization site.
To examine this scenario, we scrape the backlinks from
every page within a cluster and create a map of pages to a set of
backlinks. Figures 14 and 15 show the number of links, unique
links, and unique domains versus the number of pages per each
cluster for the wiki and GoArticles data sets, respectively.
1) Wiki: First, we observe that the number of links per
cluster closely tracks the number of pages per cluster (see Fig-
ure 14). Links occur on 99.97% ± 1.41% of pages per cluster
13

size of each spun cluster in the wiki data set.
on average. This data corroborates that spinning campaigns
contain backlinks.
Second,
the number of unique links per cluster trends
below the number of links. On average, unique links occur
on 59.48% ± 34.27% of the pages per cluster. Only two
clusters that contain more than 100 pages contain all unique
links. However, many clusters that are smaller than 100 pages
have all unique links. Taken together, the unique links data
suggests that most spinning campaigns promote fewer sites
than the number of spun pages, but some spinners craft unique
backlinks for each spun page.
Third, we consider the number of unique domains pointed
to by backlinks versus the cluster size of the article. The
intention here is to capture incidents where a clever spammer
uses unique backlinks to avoid detection, but still needs to
point to a common domain. For clusters less than 100 pages,
most unique backlinks also point to unique domains (unique
domains occur on 55.53% ± 33.49% of such cluster pages
on average). However, as the cluster size reaches at least 100
pages,
the number of unique domains trends smaller than
the number of unique backlinks (unique domains occur on
15.51%±19.90% of such cluster pages on average). This result
indicates that the larger spinning campaigns tend to target
a much smaller set of domains compared to the number of
pages in the campaign, such that unique domains occur on
53.82% ± 34.00% of cluster pages on average.
2) GoArticles: The GoArticles data set shares many of the
same trends as the wiki data set, but at smaller scale (see
Figure 15). Clusters containing less than 10 pages have an
equivalent number of links, unique links, and unique domains
in 33.70% of cases. However, clusters with at least 10 pages
tend to have several duplicate links and domains (only 7.10%
of clusters with at least 10 pages have an equivalent number
of links, unique links, and unique domains). This behavior
suggests different strategies, with larger spinning campaigns
generally targeting a smaller set of unique backlinks and
domains than the number of pages in the campaign, although
a few larger clusters contain all unique links and domains.
H. GoArticles as Seed Pages
Finally, we examine the relationship between spammed
wiki pages and the article directory. We look at the possibility
