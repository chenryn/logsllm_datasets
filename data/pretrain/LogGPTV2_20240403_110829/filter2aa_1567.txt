### Ethereum is Not Bitcoin
"The key component is this idea of a Turing-complete blockchain."  
—Vitalik Buterin

### Smart Contracts
- **Business Logic Programs**: Semi-autonomous programs that can move value and enforce agreements.
- **Limitless Creativity**: The potential applications are only limited by creativity.

### A Billion Reasons to Use Ethereum
- **No Zero-Day Exploits**
- **No Customer Code Required**
- **A Methodology for Development**
- **Realistic Expectations**: While smart contracts are powerful, they may not reach the level of "smartness" some envision.

### Solidity: The Language of Choice
- **High-Level Language**: Compiles to bytecode.
- **Similarities to JavaScript and C**: Easy to learn for developers familiar with these languages.
- **Key Features**:
  - Libraries
  - Inheritance
  - User-Defined Types
  - Inline Assembly

### Developer Tools
- **.sol Files to Bytecode to Blockchain**: The development process.
- **Auditing .sol Files**: Easier with syntax highlighting.
- **Favorite IDEs and Plugins**:
  - **Atom**: With plugins like `language-ethereum` and `etheratom`.
  - **Remix**: Browser-based IDE for Ethereum smart contract development.
  - **Solgraph**: Visualizes the control flow of your smart contracts.
  - **Oyente**: Symbolic execution tool that works with EVM bytecode or .sol files, detecting up to four types of vulnerabilities with a low false positive rate.

### Basic Methodology for Auditing Smart Contracts
1. **Interview Developers**: Understand the context and intent behind the code.
2. **Load .sol File**: Preferably with syntax highlighting.
3. **Try Compiling**: Ensure the code compiles without errors.
4. **Dissect Code Flow**: Optionally use Solgraph for visualization.
5. **Run Oyente**: Perform symbolic execution to detect vulnerabilities.
6. **Manually Verify Vulnerabilities**: Check for the following common issues:
   - **Reentrancy**: Prevent recursive calls.
   - **Unchecked Send in King of the Ether**: Ensure proper handling of ether transfers.
   - **Gas Limits**: Avoid out-of-gas errors.
   - **Withdraw Don’t Send**: Properly handle withdrawals.
   - **Encryption**: Secure sensitive data.
   - **Transaction-Ordering Dependence**: Prevent race conditions.
   - **Call-Stack Depth Limit**: Manage recursion and function calls.
   - **Variable or Function Ambiguity**: Ensure clear and unambiguous code.

### Additional Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Use `require(condition)` to validate inputs.
- **Timestamp Dependence**: Avoid relying on block timestamps for critical logic.
- **Business Logic Flaws**: Thoroughly review the business logic for any potential flaws.
- **Separating Public and Private Data**: Clearly define and separate public and private data.
