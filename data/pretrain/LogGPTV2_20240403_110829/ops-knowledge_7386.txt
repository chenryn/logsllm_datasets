User: How to implement a Token-based authentication mechanism to prevent intermediate theft and cracking of user passwords?
Assistant: The Token-based authentication mechanism can be implemented through the following steps: 1. When the user logs in, enter the user name and password, and send them to the server for verification. 2. After verifying the correctness of the user name and password, the server generates a Token and returns the Token to the client. 3. After receiving the Token, the client sends the Token in the request header to the server each time it requests. 4. When the server receives the request, it verifies the validity of the Token. If the Token is valid, it considers that the user has passed the authentication, otherwise it rejects the request. In this way, the user's password will not be transmitted to the server, nor will it be stolen and cracked during transmission. At the same time, the validity period of the Token can be set relatively short, so that even if the Token is stolen, it can only be used for a period of time, and it will become invalid after the validity period. In addition, the server can further enhance the security of identity verification through other means, such as IP restrictions and verification codes.
