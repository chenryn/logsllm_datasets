User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why are Windows computers open to network file access by default? I'm on a work network, and I had some files I wanted to give to a colleague. I set up a shared folder and directed him to my computer name to open the shared folder. Then I remembered from a long time ago seeing C$, and tried I entering this:

\\COMPUTER-NAME\C$


Now, he got access to my computer. He could do everything on my file system, including adding files to the startup folder.

Why is this open for everybody by default? Why isn't this a feature one can enable on demand? It seems a good feature for the IT department, but after doing some research I found that the permission was in LOCAL-COMPUTER-NAME\Administrators (not in a separate group for the IT department). Does Microsoft just suppose most people doesn't know about this and leave it open by default? Or is it probably our IT department who set this up by mistake?

Assistant: The C$ shares (and related $ADMIN,$IPC) are only available to members of the Administrators group.

These usually aren't a problem unless


The wrong people are made "Domain Administrators" in Active Directory
Two people are logged into their machine as "Administrator" with the same password.


According to the comments, you both log in as administrator, and because he was able to access your machine, the passwords must be the same... this is by design.

If you don't like this behaviour, then change your administrator password on both machines, and don't tell each other what that password is.  Additionally, you should create a separate account (non administrator) with a different username/password for all future work.

It is possible to disable the C$ share, but I wouldn't recommend it in a managed environment (with a decent network admin) since many administrative tools require this share to be present.  You can disable this in GPO or the registry.
