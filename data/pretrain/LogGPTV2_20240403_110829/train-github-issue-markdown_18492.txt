One issue I frequently encounter when using `var_dump`—and now, with the enhanced VarDumper component's `dump()` function—is the need to remove all debugging calls once development is complete. Finding and removing these calls can be quite challenging, often requiring me to use `grep var_dump`, which is not particularly efficient, especially on a Windows PC and in projects with numerous vendor files.

It would be extremely helpful if the location of the `dump` call could be displayed in a small, unobtrusive area, such as the top right corner of the dump output. I am not sure if this is technically feasible, but it is a feature I would greatly appreciate.
