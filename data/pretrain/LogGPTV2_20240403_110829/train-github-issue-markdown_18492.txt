One thing that always bugs me when using `var_dump` (and now, with the great
VarDumper component `dump()`) is removing all calls after debugging. I always
have a hard time to find these and end up doing `grep var_dump`, which isn't
very quick on a windows PC and in a project with many vendor files.
It would be very awesome if we can show the location of the dump call,
somewhere small in the top right corner of the dump box. I don't know if this
is possible, it's just something I would like to see.
