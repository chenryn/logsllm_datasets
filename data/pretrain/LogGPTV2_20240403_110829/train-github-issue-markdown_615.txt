Hi.  
I like this project very much. Please note that I have troubles to change the
program's settings (see below), so that, it is possible that some of my
comments/ideas may already be available.
  1. I use Visual Studio and every time I select settings option, a window with Visual Studio code opens. What about having a nice Window to edit the program settings being open by default?
  2. What about Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste selected text?
  3. What about an option to copy selected text automatically immediately after selection?
  4. What about an option to open by default a different terminal (e.g. UBUNTU) that PowerShell?
