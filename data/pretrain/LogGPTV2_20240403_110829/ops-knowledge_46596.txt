User: Please provide an overview of the concepts, principles and strategies of network security, as well as several common methods of network attack.
Assistant: 1. Concepts, principles and strategies of network security: Network security refers to the ability to protect computer networks from threats such as illegal access, illegal interference, virus attacks, and phishing. The main principles of network security include confidentiality (Confidentiality), integrity (Integrity) and availability (Availability). Network security strategies include risk assessment, security design, multiple defenses, security management, and disaster recovery. 2. Several common network attack methods: 1. E-mail spoofing: deceiving the owner of the mailbox to obtain its password or other sensitive information. 2. External attack: Use brute force password cracking, phishing, malware and other means to obtain sensitive information such as the administrator's login name and password, thereby attacking the server. 3. Internal attack: illegal access to internal employees' computer information or disclosure of confidentiality. 4. Phishing: Simulate legitimate requests or information and send them to the victim's terminal or public network, and attack through vulnerabilities in the victim's browser. 5. Malicious software: Attacks are carried out by spreading malicious programs installed on computers to other computers, infecting them with computer viruses, Trojan horses, advertising plug-ins and other malicious software.
