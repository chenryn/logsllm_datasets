User: Whilst running python scripts from my linux terminal, I find myself typing in python myfile.py way too much. Is there a way on linux (or windows) to execute a python script by just entering in the name of the script, as is possible with bash/sh? like ./script.py?
Assistant: you will need to chmod 0755 script.py and as a first line in script have something like
#!/usr/bin/python
