1. Introduction
Advances in computing and networking have added new capabilities to physical systems that could
not be feasibly added before. This has led to the emergence of engineered systems called cyber-
physical systems: systems where the physical world is measured and controlled thanks to modern
advances in computation and control. Complex machines such as aircrafts or robots, building
automation systems, smart cities and smart grids, railways and agricultural systems, medical devices
and industrial infrastructures in general are examples of cyber-physical systems. Perceived and real
security threats affecting cyber-physical systems have been attracting considerable attention in the
media, among decision makers, regulators, and in the research community.
Cyber-physical systems span cyberspace and the physical world. The fact that they can cause
tangible effects in the physical world and that, thereby, attacks in cyber space can have physical
consequences has been a major reason for the current interest in this branch of security. The concern
for physical consequences puts cyber-physical systems security apart from information security.
On one hand, this is an issue that had to be dealt with already before physical systems were
connected to cyberspace. Well-designed systems would have been deployed with appropriate safety
measures in place. Conceivably, those measures can restrain cyber-physical attacks once they have
transited from cyberspace into the physical domain. On the other hand, those countermeasures
were designed under certain assumptions, e.g. physical security protecting access to premises or
independence of component failures. Conceivably, those assumptions get invalidated once modern
IT systems get integrated with existing physical plants.
Integrating modern IT systems with existing physical systems exposes those installations to new
security threats. Some of these threats are well-known in IT security and countermeasures have been
studied at length. Those threats are new only because of a new application area. Other threats may
indeed be speciﬁc to cyber-physical systems. Our work aims at making a distinction between “old”
security issues in new settings, and new security aspects intrinsic to cyber-physical systems that
would establish cyber-physical security as an object of study in its own rights.
While compromising or disrupting devices or communication channels used to sense or control
a physical system is a necessary requirement to attacks aimed at disrupting the physical process,
the damage from the attack will be limited if the attacker is unable of manipulating the control

system in a way to achieve her desired outcome in the physical world. After all, breaking into a
system is not the same as breaking a system. In order to achieve a desired impact on a control
system (like Stuxnet [32]), the attacker needs to assess how her attack will perform at the regulatory
control level. Launching such an attack requires a different body of knowledge from the one used in
IT security. In particular, attackers need to know how the physical process is controlled, and that
includes knowledge of failure conditions of the equipment [33], control principles [53], knowledge
of process behavior [40], and signal processing, etc.
Your wish is my command?
It is often claimed that “once communications security is compromised the attacker can do
whatever she wants”. These are presumptuous claims. The attacker may well be able to
inject any input she wants but this does not necessarily amount to being able to inﬂuence
processes in the physical world at will. The processes and their actuators have to be properly
understood. Process physics and built-in safety measures might get in the way of the attacker.
In our work we consider the physical part of attacks and examine the hurdles an attacker might
face when trying to manipulate physical processes, using realistic simulation model of a vinyl acetate
plant as a case study. In our work we demonstrate a complete attack, from start to end, directed at
persistent economic damage to a production site while avoiding attribution of production loss to a
cyber-event. Such an attack scenario could be useful to a manufacturer aiming at putting competitors
out of business or as a strong argument in an extortion attack.
Process simulators play an important role in process control studies. Rigorous non-linear process
models are useful tools for accurately understanding process dynamics, and thus can be used in both
control structure development and validation. At this point in time, very few models of industrial
processes are available for analysis by security researchers. To draw general lessons for cyber-
physical systems security, be it on the true power of an attacker or on the efﬁcacy of the defenses
deployed, many more documented case studies will be necessary.
1.1
Process Control Systems
In the process industry process refers to the methods of changing or reﬁning raw materials to
create an end product. Process industries include (petro)chemical, food, water treatment, power
and other industries. Control refers to the methods that are used to control process variables
when manufacturing a product. This is done for three major reasons: (1) reducing variability; (2)
increasing efﬁciency; (3) ensuring safety. The ﬁrst two points are important for plant economy.
Reduced variability lowers operational costs and ensures consistent quality of the end product.
Efﬁciency refers to the accurate maintenance of optimal production conditions to decrease the
production bill. Precise control is important for preventing runaway processes and ensuring safe
operations.
The starting point in process engineering is deciding on a setpoint (SP) – the desired value of
a certain process parameter, e.g. a tank level L. Level L is called measured variable and must be
kept as close as possible to the setpoint by the means of control methods. Level L might be in fact
determined indirectly via measuring two process variables (PV), in- and out-ﬂows. If a level is
measured directly, measured and process variable are the same. Process variables are processed
by a controller containing a control algorithm based on a complex set of equations. The controller
calculates the offset between SP and PV and outputs an actionable manipulated value (MV) to the

actuator to bring the process closer to the SP. Such interactions form a basic feedback control loop
as shown in Fig. 1.1a. In practice, control loops can be complex. More common are multivariable
or advanced control loops in which each MV depends on two or more of the measured variables
(Fig. 1.1b). The strategies for holding a process at setpoint are not trivial, and the interactions
of numerous setpoints in the overall process control plan can be subtle and complex. Process
interactions may cause loop interactions via hidden feedback control loops. This makes controller
tuning difﬁcult and yields unstable loops.

(b) Multi-variable control loop
Figure 1.1: Types of control loops
Industrial Process Control Systems are used to provide autonomous control over a production
process through control loops. They monitor the production process via sensors deployed around the
product line and interact with the process through actuators. The complexity of modern production
processes is usually simpliﬁed by dividing the control load into subsystems containing separate
control loops. Heavy control loop couplings among subsystems are avoided.
In order to enhance the security of an process control systems from a system perspective, secure
control theory which studies how cyber attacks affect the physical dynamics of the system has been
explored in recent years.
2. Classes of Cyber-Physical Attacks
Modern industrial plants face multiple challenges – to deliver products at consistent quality and
possibly low cost, to manage plant dynamics altered by material recycle and energy integration, to
satisfy environmental and safety regulations, and to have a certain degree of ﬂexibility to handle
ﬂuctuations such as production rate changes (in response to changing market demand) and feed
quality. All of these are the responsibilities of a reliable and efﬁcient control system. Modern plants
are now becoming more complex than just the union of a set of unit operations.
In information security, the attacker’s goal may be to exﬁltrate information or to disrupt the
normal operations of software. In the cyber-physical domain, the attacker’s goal is to disrupt the
normal operations of control systems. When weaponizing a buffer overﬂow, shellcode is constructed
that instructs a system to perform speciﬁc actions desired by the attacker. Similarly, in cyber-physical
exploits the attacker’s payload will contain a set of instructions that manipulate the process, and the
choice of instructions depends on the speciﬁc impact the attacker wants to have on the process.
So what can actually be done to a process? The effects of cyber-physical attacks can be classiﬁed
into three groups. Admittedly, the classes outlined are interrelated as damage of one kind may lead to
another kind of damage. For example, production can be disrupted through breakage of equipment.
Runaway reactions can cause serious safety accidents and equipment breakage. However, a clear
understanding of the attack goal is necessary for maximizing attack impact and minimizing the cost
of attack implementations avoiding “over-engineering”.

2.1
Equipment damage
This class of attacks aims for physical damage of equipment or infrastructure (e.g. pipes, valves).
Larsen [33] discusses classes of physical damage. Equipment damage can be achieved in two ways.
Overstress of equipment. Every equipment wears out or breaks at the end of its expected life
cycle. Prolonged overstress of equipment can accelerate this process. An example are wear-off
attacks on valves due to unstable process control. This type of attack was implemented in the second
version of the Stuxnet worm [32].
Violation of safety limits. The second option is to violate safety limits, ideally in some smart
way. In this way researchers at Idaho National Labs remotely destroyed a power generator [57]. This
type of attack was also realized in the ﬁrst version of Stuxnet [32]. Those targeting at continuous
processes can consult [35] for safety limits of piping infrastructures and related equipment.
2.2
Production damage
Instead of breaking equipment an attacker can go after the production process to spoil the product or
make production more expensive. Attacks on production can be divided into three groups.
Product quality and production rate. Attacks may be directed at the product itself – its quality
or production rate. Every product has its speciﬁcation and market prices for a speciﬁc quality.
The attacker may turn the product unusable or reduce its value. The price of a product may rise
exponentially with product purity. Table 2.1 presents relative prices for paracetamol. As can be seen,
not achieving the desired product quality can be very expensive.

Operating costs. After the process is tuned, the operator’s primary task is to keep the process as
close as possible to the economically optimal operating conditions. Every plant has an objective cost
function consisting of several components which impact the operating costs. It may be loss of raw
materials in the purge, premature deactivation of the catalyst, or increased energy usage.
Maintenance efforts. The attacker can impact a production process by increasing the main-
tenance workload. Maintenance refers to troubleshooting process disturbances and equipment
malfunction. For example, rapid operation of a ﬂow valve causes a damaging cavitation process -
the formation of vapor cavities in a liquid. Cavitation eventually wears the valve and leads to leaks
(requiring valve replacement); also bubbling of a liquid substantially complicates process control.
2.3
Compliance violation
Industrial sectors tend to be strongly regulated to ensure safety and to protect the environment.
Non-compliance can attract ﬁnes and bad publicity, unlike attacks whose effect can be kept internal
to a company.

Chapter 2. Classes of Cyber-Physical Attacks
Safety. Most damaging would be attacks on occupational and environmental safety as they may
result in lethal accidents and serious environmental damage. This type of attack in most cases will
yield collateral damage.
Environmental pollution Less dramatic would be attacks causing regulatory pollution limits
to be exceeded. This can relate to the concentration and volume of gaseous emissions, water or
soil contamination and similar. For example, if efﬂuent from an industrial facility fails to meet
local regulatory standards, the plant can be ﬁned, and recurrent offenses can lead to plant shutdown.
Negative impact on reputation may be a further consequence.
Contractual agreements. Typically this refers to production schedules. Take vaccine production
