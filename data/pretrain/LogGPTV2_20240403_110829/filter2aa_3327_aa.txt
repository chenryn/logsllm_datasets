## 1. Introduction

Advances in computing and networking have added new capabilities to physical systems that were previously unfeasible. This has led to the emergence of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where the physical world is measured and controlled through modern computational and control technologies. Examples of CPS include complex machines like aircraft and robots, building automation systems, smart cities and grids, railways, agricultural systems, medical devices, and industrial infrastructures.

Security threats to CPS have garnered significant attention from the media, decision-makers, regulators, and the research community. These systems span both cyberspace and the physical world, and their ability to cause tangible physical effects means that cyber attacks can have real-world consequences. This differentiates CPS security from traditional information security.

While well-designed systems may have safety measures in place, integrating modern IT with existing physical systems introduces new security threats. Some of these threats are well-known in IT security, but others are specific to CPS. Our work aims to distinguish between "old" security issues in new settings and new security aspects intrinsic to CPS, establishing it as a distinct field of study.

Compromising or disrupting devices or communication channels used to sense or control a physical system is a necessary step for attacks aimed at disrupting the physical process. However, the damage will be limited if the attacker cannot manipulate the control system to achieve the desired outcome. For example, the Stuxnet attack required detailed knowledge of the physical process, including equipment failure conditions, control principles, and process behavior.

### 1.1 Process Control Systems

In the process industry, "process" refers to methods for changing or refining raw materials to create an end product. This includes industries such as (petro)chemical, food, water treatment, power, and others. Control methods are used to manage process variables during manufacturing for three main reasons: reducing variability, increasing efficiency, and ensuring safety. Reduced variability lowers operational costs and ensures consistent quality, while efficiency reduces production costs. Precise control is crucial for preventing runaway processes and ensuring safe operations.

The starting point in process engineering is setting a setpoint (SP), the desired value of a process parameter, such as a tank level \( L \). The level \( L \) is a measured variable that must be kept close to the SP using control methods. The controller calculates the offset between the SP and the process variable (PV) and outputs a manipulated value (MV) to the actuator to bring the process closer to the SP. This forms a basic feedback control loop (Figure 1.1a). In practice, control loops can be more complex, involving multiple variables (Figure 1.1b).

(a) Single Feedback Control Loop
(b) Multi-Variable Control Loop
**Figure 1.1: Types of Control Loops**

Industrial Process Control Systems (PCS) provide autonomous control over a production process through control loops, monitoring the process via sensors and interacting with it through actuators. Modern production processes are often divided into subsystems with separate control loops to simplify complexity and avoid heavy coupling.

Recent years have seen the exploration of secure control theory, which studies how cyber attacks affect the physical dynamics of the system, enhancing the security of PCS from a system perspective.

## 2. Classes of Cyber-Physical Attacks

Modern industrial plants face multiple challenges, including delivering products at consistent quality and low cost, managing plant dynamics, satisfying environmental and safety regulations, and handling fluctuations in production rates and feed quality. These responsibilities fall on a reliable and efficient control system.

In information security, attackers aim to exfiltrate information or disrupt software operations. In the cyber-physical domain, the goal is to disrupt the normal operations of control systems. When weaponizing a buffer overflow, shellcode instructs the system to perform specific actions. Similarly, in cyber-physical exploits, the attacker's payload contains instructions to manipulate the process, depending on the desired impact.

Cyber-physical attacks can be classified into three groups:

### 2.1 Equipment Damage

This class of attacks aims to physically damage equipment or infrastructure, such as pipes and valves. Equipment damage can be achieved in two ways:
- **Overstress of Equipment:** Prolonged overstress can accelerate wear and tear, as seen in the second version of the Stuxnet worm.
- **Violation of Safety Limits:** Violating safety limits can lead to equipment failure, as demonstrated by researchers at Idaho National Labs who remotely destroyed a power generator.

### 2.2 Production Damage

Instead of damaging equipment, attackers can target the production process to spoil the product or increase production costs. Attacks on production can be divided into three groups:
- **Product Quality and Production Rate:** Attacks can reduce product quality or production rate, making the product unusable or less valuable. For example, the price of paracetamol rises exponentially with purity (Table 2.1).
- **Operating Costs:** After tuning the process, the operator's task is to maintain economically optimal operating conditions. Attacks can increase operating costs through loss of raw materials, premature catalyst deactivation, or increased energy usage.
- **Maintenance Efforts:** Increasing maintenance workload, such as causing cavitation in flow valves, can complicate process control and require frequent valve replacements.

| Purity | Price, Euro/kg |
|--------|-----------------|
| 98%    | 1.0             |
| 99%    | 5.0             |
| 100%   | 8205.0          |

### 2.3 Compliance Violation

Industrial sectors are heavily regulated to ensure safety and protect the environment. Non-compliance can result in fines and bad publicity. Compliance violations can be categorized as follows:
- **Safety:** Attacks on occupational and environmental safety can lead to lethal accidents and serious environmental damage.
- **Environmental Pollution:** Exceeding regulatory pollution limits, such as gaseous emissions or water contamination, can result in fines and plant shutdowns.
- **Contractual Agreements:** Violations of production schedules, such as those in vaccine production, can lead to legal and financial penalties.

## 3. Stages of Cyber-Physical Attacks

Cyber-physical attacks typically follow several stages:
- **Access:** Gaining entry to the system.
- **Discovery:** Identifying the system's architecture and vulnerabilities.
- **Control:** Manipulating the system to achieve the desired effect.
- **Damage:** Causing the intended harm.
- **Cleanup:** Removing traces of the attack to avoid detection.
