# Best Practices for the Kusto Data Library

This article provides best practices for working with the [Kusto Data library](about-kusto-data.md).

## Use a Single Client Instance

The Kusto client providers are designed to be thread-safe and support concurrent use by multiple threads. They also cache information retrieved during the initial connection to your cluster. To optimize performance, it is recommended to reuse a single client instance rather than creating a new one for each request.

## Specify the Database Parameter

The default database property in the Kusto client provider is not thread-safe. It is advisable to set this property when the client is created and avoid changing it afterward. If a single client is used to send requests to multiple databases, use methods that accept a database parameter to specify the target database.

## Dispose of the Client and Request Results

Although the Kusto client object is designed to handle multiple requests, it should be disposed of once it is no longer needed to send further requests. Similarly, request result objects should be disposed of after they have served their purpose. Proper disposal of these objects is crucial for maintaining scalability, as they hold essential network resources until explicitly disposed of or garbage collected.
