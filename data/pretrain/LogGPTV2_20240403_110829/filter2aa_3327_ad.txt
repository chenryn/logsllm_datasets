values needed to monitor attack performance. Also process information may spread across
disparate subsystems forcing the attacker to invade a greater number of devices. Generally
speaking, there are two types of measurements: “technician answer” is a qualitative measure,
e.g. whether process measurement will decrease or decrease while “engineering answer”
gives a quantitative answer by how much. When exploiting a process, anything requiring
an engineering answer is hard as it often relies on data unique to the plant and its current
operating mode.
In order to determine monetary loss one needs to measure how much of vinyl acetate is produced
in the reactor. As determined in the discovery stage, there is no analyzer installed in the reactor exit
feed. Therefore the attacker does not have an engineering answer. However, the rate of the reaction
can be qualitatively determined from the reactor exit temperature. A decrease in temperature signals
that less reaction is happening in the reactor, so less product is being produced (Fig. 6.3a). This
measure can be sufﬁcient to determine whether a speciﬁc attack has an effect on the reaction rate, but
does not allow to quantify the effect of an attack and select the most effective one. Looking at the
process ﬂowsheet, the only location where the attacker would be able to determine the exact amount
of VAC produced is the decanter exit. However, this number would be available to the attacker only
after hours, at the end of the reﬁnement phase. This may not be a satisfactory option. Moreover, this
would require the attacker to exploit additional devices. In our analysis we have not found a way to
meet this challenge.

In the real world such a challenge would force the attacker to look into controller code or search
for process models in the test plant. In our case, we decided to look into the model code. In particular
we were interested in the state variables in the reactor unit, used in the internal computations of the
process model. We were able to locate “concentration” variables of seven chemical components
6.4 Damage
27
in ten sections of the reactor. Through extensive analysis of the obtained data and familiarizing
ourselves with the principle of operation of the plug ﬂow reactor employed in the VAC plant we
could determine that the concentration of chemicals in the tenth section would be the same or about
the same as in the reactor outﬂow. We still did not have the unit measure of those numbers, which
did not sum up to one/hundred or to the total ﬂow. After further investigations we could conclude
that molar concentrations of chemical components can be computed according to the formula:
MOLcomp(t) =
CONCcomp(t)
∑compCONCcomp(t),
where CONCcomp(t) are concentrations of the individual chemical components.
We have veriﬁed the obtained numbers with those provided in Table 5 in [39]. Since the total
reactor exit ﬂow is directly measured in the plant, we could compute the amount of vinyl acetate
produced:
Out flowcomp(t) = MOLcomp(t)[%mol]×Freac[Kmol/min],
where Freac is measured reactor outﬂow, XMEAS(6).
The production of vinyl acetate is shown in Fig. 6.3b. The rate of VAC production indeed
coincides with the reactor outﬂow temperature proﬁle. Knowing the molar production of VAC we
could ﬁnally quantify production loss in dollar equivalents as:
Cost = VACout[Kmol]×86.09[g/mol]×0.971[$/kg],
where 86.09[g/mol] is VAC molar weight and 0.971[$/kg] is VAC price as given in [39]. To verify
the numbers obtained we compared the amount of VAC produced in reactor over a period of time
(Fig. 6.4a) with the amount of VAC leaving the factory as ﬁnal organic product (Fig. 6.4b); the
numbers matched.

With a suitable metric for evaluating the impact of the attack we could ﬁnally start searching
for effective attacks. We have established the reference value of the steady-state production to
determine loss (or gain) as a result of the attack. The categorization of the control loops based on

their economic damage potential is given in Tbl. 6.3. Certain attacks have caused an increase of
vinyl acetate produced. This does not necessarily mean that the overall ﬁnancial gain of the plant
as such increased as production may have come at the cost of increased operating costs. However,
we did not pursue this investigation. Therefore we did not consider attacks causing product gain as
“successful”.

Table 6.3: Categorization of control loops based on damage potential
Note that attacks on XMV(1), oxygen feed, only have little attack potential, but also that this
control loop easily becomes unstable. In addition, this control loop must be manipulated with great
care is it quickly reaches its safety limit. Among all XMVs we mark this XMV as of least use.
Outcome of the damage stage
We conclude the damage phase with a portfolio of attacks which can be deployed at any opportune
time. By scheduling attack value, attack duration and process recovery time we can control the
amount of economic damage we would like to bring about.
Important considerations
Note that our analysis has only determined how much money will be lost. Ideally damage
numbers should be multiplied by the chance of success so that a risky high-damage scenario
can be compared with a low-risk low-damage scenarios. Precise risk metrics may never be
available, but in general attacks that require manipulating more components are considered a
higher risk. Attacks that require an engineering answer are riskier than attacks only requiring
a technician answer. Finally attacks that must hit a particular measure value or fail are riskier
than attacks that simply get more effective the closer they are to the optimal value.
6.5
Cleanup
In our attack scenario we were aiming at attacks that do not move the process towards unsafe
conditions. Since we are not causing alarms, the operator may not notice immediately that the
process has drifted from the economically optimal operating state. However, process operators may
get concerned after noticing a persistent decrease in VAC production and may try to ﬁx the problem.
There can be numerous reasons for a process upset and operators are used to them. In this section
we discuss how to inﬂuence the operator’s believe about what is happening with the process.
Having a human operator in the control loop (Fig. 6.5) turns process control system from
pure cyber-physical system into socio-technical system (STS). To take advantage of the operator’s
“vulnerabilities” the attacker needs to understand the speciﬁcs of the operator’s job and act according
6.5 Cleanup
29
to identiﬁed weaknesses in operator’s attention, judgment process or standard procedures he has to
follow.
Figure 6.5: Socio-technical system
When a plant starts loosing money, investigations into that loss of revenue are likely. It may
further be impossible to simply erase real-world effects. In this case the attacker needs to convince
the investigators that the loss of revenue is due to some cause other than a hacker in the system.
This can be done in a number of ways. For instance, the investigator may be persuaded that the
disturbance arose due to operator error. If losses are timed so that they fall in a particular employee’s
shift every time, one might end up investigating the employee rather than the process.
The investigator may be persuaded that the change is environmental in nature. The attack pattern
can be made to increase on rainy days or hot days. Another option is to persuade the investigator that
the loss is to do equipment failure. Most chemical plants are harsh environments and components
fail regularly. If an attacker either kills a controller through cyber means or waits for a component to
fail naturally before starting an attack cycle, the investigator may believe that the problems are the
fault of a suboptimal tuning of the new components instead of a cyber attack.
Overall, events that can be used as a decoy for an attack can be grouped as:
• Change in operating conditions: change of set point, change of raw material supplier, new
equipment, etc.
• Maintenance work: scheduled or unscheduled.
• Speciﬁc events: change in weather conditions, particular operator on duty, etc.
If multiple attacks are chained together they can be rotated when the attacker observes a change
in the system. An industrial process, just like software, has to be debugged when it malfunctions. If
the attacker changes her attacks based on the debugging efforts of the chemical engineers, future
attacks may be attributed to the efforts of the engineer rather than a cyber attacker. Fig. 6.6 illustrates
four different attacks which show themselves as symmetric ﬂuctuations of different amplitudes in
reactor exit temperature.
It is not possible to see directly into the reactor. Investigators will apply speciﬁc metrics allowing
them to evaluate the chemical processes in the reactor and hopefully determine potential reasons
for the deterioration of reactor efﬁciency. They will then schedule maintenance work related to the
causes identiﬁed. For this reason the attacker may keep “playing” different attacks having the same
effect on speciﬁc chemical processes in the reactor making engineers believe that their maintenance
efforts are not bringing the expected results. Typical examples of such metrics would be selectivity
and conversion rate. Selectivity is a metric to control catalyst activity. Catalyst selectivity determines

the fraction of the ethylene consumed that makes the desired VAC product or in other words how
much (in percent) of the primary reaction has been induced by the catalyst:
SEL(t) =
VACout(t)
VACout(t)+0.5×CO2out(t) ×100,
where VACout(t) and CO2out(t) are molar ﬂows of the respective chemical components in the reactor
outﬂow.
Conversion determines the fraction of the chemicals consumed (converted into product and
byproducts) during the reaction. This metric is informative in several ways. For instance there are
certain safety limits and best-practice conversion rates, which should not be exceeded. Thus, reduced
conversion rate of acetic acid and increased conversion of ethylene suggest an increase of the amount
of the undesired secondary reaction. Conversion is computed as
CONVcomp(t) = COMPin(t)−COMPout(t)
COMPin(t)
×100,
where COMPin(t) and COMPout(t) are molar masses of the chemical components in the reactor in-
and outﬂows.
In addition we introduced a metric to measure reactor efﬁciency. It computes how much molar
mass of acetic acid has reacted, and compares this value to the amount of reacted ethylene. Since
the reaction ratio of ethylene and acetic acid in the primary reaction is 1:1, the amount of reacted
acetic acid is equal to the amount of correctly reacted ethylene. Relating this value to the amount
of total reacted ethylene indicates the percentage of the primary reaction. Efﬁciency allows similar
conclusions as selectivity, however, it is calculated based on the converted reagents rather than on
the produced products:
EFF(t) = HACin(t)−HACout(t)
C2H4in(t)−C2H4out(t) ×100,
Fig. 6.7 illustrates processes in the reactor during the attack on XMV(2). We have decreased
ethylene feed at time t = 120 minutes. One can see how the attack affects the ratio between
primary and secondary (ethylene combustion) reaction: the percentage of the primary reaction drops
