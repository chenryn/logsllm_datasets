User: I want to able to open a command prompt at the folder which contains a python script and just type in the script name without the .py and watch it run.
Following the various tips on google to do this, I do:

Add the python.exe to my path
Add .py to PATHEXT
Try to open the .py file in windows explored.  When prompted with: What program do you want to open this? I navigate to my python.exe

What should happen is the python.exe should be added to the 'Open With' pop up, but it is not? I re try with the python.exe off my path.  Same problem.
Note every time I set a path it is in the control panel. Version of python is 2.7.  And to make things stranger, I can associate .py programs with pythonw - but this is no use, as I want the console.
Any help appreciated.
Assistant: Create a file named 'personalisedCommand.cmd' in a path folder with this inside:
@echo off
python absolute/path/to/pythonScript
