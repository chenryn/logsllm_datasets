then D(cid:48)(cid:48) = (1, 1,−1, 0, 0), or if D(cid:48) = (1, 10, 0, 5, 4, 2) then
D(cid:48)(cid:48) = (1,−1, 1,−1,−1). Finally we merge repeat values in D(cid:48)(cid:48),
so for example, (0, 1, 1, 0,−1,−1) becomes (0, 1, 0,−1). The re-
sulting merged tendency vector is the size-change pattern. Again
the top ﬁve such patterns observed are given in Table 11.
As previously noted, about half the clusters in EC2 and Azure,
respectively, follow pattern 0 (no change in cluster size). Clusters
in pattern 0 can be further split into two groups:
(1) Ephemeral clusters: the median number of IPs they used is
zero, because they just appeared in the cloud for a very short pe-
riod of time. In EC2, 11.4% of all clusters are ephemeral while in
Azure 13.1% are ephemeral. Of ephemeral clusters, 92.8% only
use 1 IP, 99.1% use less than 3 IPs, and 24 clusters use more than
10 IPs. We arbitrarily chose 10 of these last 24 clusters for manual
investigation, which revealed a few explanations that may general-
ize more broadly: (a) a website was under maintenance so it tem-
porarily changed the top-level webpage; (b) a website just moved
into the cloud and was under construction, and we caught the in-
development webpage; or (c) the webpage was developed by ten-
ants who may temporarily use the cloud for testing and left the
cloud soon.
(2) Relatively stable clusters: The other 38.5% of clusters in
EC2 (40.8% in Azure) instead use nearly the same number of IPs
in each round over the entire measurement period. In this group,
38,466 (15.8%) clusters in EC2 and 7,789 (24.5%) in Azure haven’t
changed the number of IPs they used during measurement periods
and are available in each scan round. Most of these clusters (92.7%)
use the exact same IP addresses all the time.
Pattern 0,-1,1,0 represents clusters that have a drop in the in-
stance usage, immediately followed by an increase. A short-term
unavailability can cause such a drop. We deﬁne the lifetime of a
cluster as the time period between the ﬁrst time a cluster is avail-
able and the last time it was available. The cluster uptime is the
fraction of time the cluster is available relative to its lifetime. For
example, if a cluster was ﬁrst observed on one day, and last ob-
served 10 days later, and no IP associated with it responded on one
of the days in between, then the lifetime is 10 days and the uptime is
90%. In EC2 54.3%’s of the singleton clusters have 100% uptime,
89.1% have ≥ 90% uptime, and 92.7% have ≥ 80%. Of clusters of

or larger.
size 2, 86.4% have a 100% uptime. The cluster uptime of all the
clusters with size greater than or equal to 18 is 100%. Clusters in
Azure show a similar pattern — in general, the more IPs a cluster
uses, the higher cluster uptime it has. The cluster IP time of only
a small fraction of clusters are less than 90% (9.4% of clusters in
EC2 and 10.6% in Azure).
Churn within clusters. We turn now to measuring the amount
of turnover in IPs used by a given cluster. Website deployments
may be designed to have relatively high turnover, taking advantage
of cloud elasticity to scale with demand. For example, EC2 in-
cludes an auto-scaling feature, and several third party companies
advertise similar services. Alternatively, churn may be indicative
of instability in deployments such as VM instance restarts caused
by crashes or other failures. Our measurements cannot distinguish
between such causes of churn, but can give an overall estimate of
the amount of churn.
We deﬁne the uptime of an IP for a given cluster as the fraction of
days the IP is available and associated to the cluster divided by the
total amount of time the cluster is available. The average IP uptime
of a cluster is the average of IP uptimes for all IPs associated to the
cluster. Average IP uptime therefore provides a measure of how
much a cluster experiences churn within the IPs that it uses. If a
cluster uses the same IP addresses all the time, then the average
IP uptime of this cluster will be 100%. Low average IP uptime
indicates the cluster frequently changes IPs.
A total of 183,119 (75.3%) clusters in EC2 and 25,037 (78.9%)
in Azure have a 100% average IP uptime. The bulk of these are
singleton clusters, meaning clusters of size one. In EC2, 71.4% of
all clusters are singletons, and in Azure 76.2% are singletons. For
non-singleton clusters, we ﬁnd more evidence of churn. Figure 12
gives a CDF of the average IP uptimes across all clusters of size
two or larger. We see that about half of the clusters have average
IP uptime greater than 90%, in either cloud. A large fraction in fact
(27.2% and 30.1% of clusters in EC2 and Azure, respectively) have
average IP uptime between 95% and 99%, indicative of low churn.
For the other half of clusters having below 90% average IP uptime,
we see quite a spread of uptimes.
When the cluster size increases, the average IP uptime becomes
smaller. For clusters with cluster size 50 or greater, the average IP
uptime is 62%. For the top 10 websites by cluster size, about 90%
of the IPs being used in one measurement round, are still used in
the next round, but less than 50% of the IPs have been used for the
entire 3 months.
Region and VPC usage. Prior work [2] showed that the vast ma-
jority of websites use a single region. Our measurements are inline
with this: 97.0% of all clusters use a single region. Even among

associated to. These clusters show a diversity of usage dynamics.
In the table, the total number of unique IPs associated to the
cluster across the entire measurement period is “Total #IP”, while
“Mean/Median/Min/Max #IP” indicate the basic statistics of num-
ber of IPs used by a cluster across all rounds. The average IP up-
time of these clusters varies greatly, and is generally lower than the
uptime of smaller clusters. As noted previously, most IPs are stable
for short periods of time, meaning if they are used by the clus-
ter in one round of measurement they are likely to be used in the
next. The column “Max IP departure” gives the maximum, across
all rounds, of IPs leaving a cluster as a fraction of the number of
IPs used by the cluster in that round. An IP leaves a cluster in a
given round if it was not associated with the cluster in that round,
but was in the previous round. The column “Stable IP” gives the
ratio of the number of IPs that were used throughout the entire mea-
surement period by the cluster over the total number of unique IPs
used by the cluster. As can be seen, long-run stability is low except
for cluster 9. Finally, we give the number of regions used and the
average number of VPC IPs per round for each cluster.
8.2 Finding and Analyzing Malicious Activity
We turn to using WhoWas to investigate malicious activity on
IaaS clouds. We use two sources for ﬂagging malicious behavior,
Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal. We will show that WhoWas
can help investigate, as well as discover new, malicious activity.
We will also quantify the time between a website appearing and
it being marked as malicious and the time an IP address remains
malicious after being dropped from a blacklist.
Google Safe Browsing. The Google Safe Browsing API allows
one to submit a URL and obtain a status report indicating a status
of either “phishing”, “malware” (hosting malicious software), or
“ok”. To make use of the API, we extracted all the URLs con-
tained in top-level webpages gathered by WhoWas and queried
each against the safe browsing API after each round of scanning. In
each round, there were about 3.2 M distinct URLs across the entire
set of pages fetched, only a small fraction of which end up marked
as malicious by Safe Browsing.
For EC2, we found 196 unique IPs (149 in classic and 47 in VPC)
that contain at least one link labeled as phishing or malware, for a
total of 1,393 distinct malicious URLs. Many of the webpages con-
tain multiple malicious URLs: nine had a total of 63 URLs marked
as phishing and 187 of them had a total of 1,330 URLs marked as
malware. These 196 IPs are associated to 51 distinct clusters. A
total of 19 IPs hosting malicious links were associated to different
clusters (over time), but upon manual inspection of the webpages it
was clear that the different clusters were in fact just revisions of the
same, signiﬁcant enough to push them into a distinct cluster. All but
18 of the IPs that the malicious URLs resolved to are outside EC2.
Interestingly, one IP address removed the malicious URL around 3
days after being detected, changed the webpage to include a differ-
ent malicious URL, and then changed it later to again include the
ﬁrst malicious URL. The webpage on this IP in fact appears to be
legitimate (upon manual inspection), so it could be that the hosting
server is compromised.
For Azure, we found 14 malicious URLs hosted on 13 distinct
IPs that are associated to 11 clusters. All of these URLs are mal-
ware URLs. The malicious URLs were resolved to 19 IPs, and 7
of these IPs are in Azure. We did not ﬁnd any malicious URLs that
were linked to by webpages in both clouds.
Below we say that an IP is malicious if it hosts a webpage includ-
ing a malicious URL. We deﬁne the lifetime of a malicious IP as the
number of days that an IP address has a malicious URL within its

clusters in EC2 VPC and classic instances. X-axis is the round of

the top 5% of all clusters (in terms of cluster size), only 21.5% use
more than a single region. While most of the clusters use the same
region(s) over time, a small number of them have a change in re-
gion usage. 98.37% of clusters use the same region(s), 0.7% use 1
extra region, 0.07% use 2 extra regions, 0.76% decrease by 1, and
0.07% decrease by 2 in EC2. In Azure, 97.33% use the same re-
gion(s), 1.28% use 1 extra region, 1.13% decreased by 1 and 0.09%
decreased by 2.
For EC2, we can use the cartographic mechanisms described in
§5 to examine the usage of VPC versus classic networking. This
is particularly interesting as it shows the uptake of a newer feature,
and one that is required for new accounts. Figure 13 shows a time-
line of the number of responsive and available IPs as broken down
by VPC/classic. We found in total 177,246 (72.9% of all clusters)
use only classic IPs; 59,547 (24.5%) use only VPC IPs; and 6,371
(2.6%) use both classic and VPC IPs. As shown in Figure 14, the
number of classic-only clusters is decreasing rapidly while VPC-
only and mixed clusters are increasing. We also observed a total
of 1,024 mixed clusters that transitioned from classic to VPC while
483 went in the other direction.
Large clusters. We found a number of very large clusters within
the collected data. Table 15 gives details regarding the top ten clus-
ters in EC2, by average cluster size (the clusters in Azure have rel-
atively smaller sizes compared with those in EC2, so we did not
examine them in detail). We manually investigated these ten clus-
