This strange behavior came up in pandas-dev/pandas#19813:
    In [23]: np.array([], dtype=object).sum()
    Out[23]: False
    In [26]: np.array([], dtype=object).prod()
    Out[26]: True
It's almost as if NumPy picks a dtype at random (e.g., bool in this case) to
use for computing the result. A more obviously and likely more consistent
choice would be to use the identities for the appropriate ufuncs (i.e.,
`np.add.identity` and `np.mul.identity`), which are the integers `0` and `1`,
respectively.
