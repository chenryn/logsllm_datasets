I am currently developing a remote backup solution using Python. The server component will operate on Unix/Linux, as it will utilize hard links to facilitate efficient incremental backups. However, the client component must also run on Windows, where file locking can present challenges.

From my research, it appears that the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is a suitable solution for this issue. VSS functions similarly to LVM snapshots and is not affected by file locks. Unfortunately, the VSS API does not seem to be supported in pywin32.

My current plan is to use a wrapper that will create a temporary VSS snapshot, execute the client, and then delete the snapshot afterward. I am curious if anyone has experience with this approach or any suggestions.

One potential solution you might consider is using IronPython for the Windows client. This would provide access to COM+ DLLs and other WinAPI objects, while still allowing you to write Python code. Although I cannot confirm with 100% certainty, IronPython should support VSS.
