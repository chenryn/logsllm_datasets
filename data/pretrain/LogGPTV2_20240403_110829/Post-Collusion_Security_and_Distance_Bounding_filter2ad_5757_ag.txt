distance bounding protocols: A critical mission supported by decision theory.
Figure 15: A distance hijacking attack on MAD protocol [19]
with one-way authentication. P learns b and s ⊕ b (and s by
extension) from passive observation of the legitimate fast
phase. Therefore, P produces their own authentication mes-
sage ⟨s′, MACk(V , P, b, s)⟩.
B.3 Attempts to Implement Distance Hijacking
The checkDB7 tool created by Chothia et al. [20] is used to compile
ProVerif files for distance bounding protocols. We attempted to find
distance hijacking attacks by using the checkDB tool as follows. A
class of attacks is defined in Chothia et al.’s model by a configu-
ration of agents. For example, the configuration [V(id)]|[DP(id)]
corresponds to a verifier V authenticating a distant dishonest prover
DP - this represents a distance fraud attack. In the syntax of the
checkDB tool, this is written as:
[!Verifier] |
[!(new id;
let idP = id in !DishonestProver)
]
Security is then modelled by the reachability of the query:
query ev:Verified(id)
Intuitively, the query is satisfied whenever it is possible for a
verifier to reach the end of their role specification (the value id is a
free term and not tied to a specific identifier). Note that in the case
of distance fraud, this means the query is satisfied only if there is
an attack.
The checkDB tool is also used to verify terrorist fraud, mafia
fraud, and a property referred to as uncompromised distance bound-
ing. Note that in each of these cases, the configuration also ensures
that a verifier can only reach the end of their specification if an
attack exists.
We attempted to implement distance hijacking by testing the
process:
[ !Verifier |
(new id2;
let idP=id2 in !Prover)
