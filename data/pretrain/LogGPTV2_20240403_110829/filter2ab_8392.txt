**ATT&CK ID:** T1069  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Permission Groups Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to discover group and permission settings to identify available user accounts, group memberships, and elevated permissions.

Understanding these details can enable adversaries to plan and execute more targeted attacks.
