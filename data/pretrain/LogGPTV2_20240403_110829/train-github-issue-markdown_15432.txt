In the 1.9 branch (including whats in the centos 6 repo) in the Runner class,
it appears ansible is trying to duplicate the fileno for a new stdin, however,
this introduces a file descriptor leak since the dup is never closed.
Additionally, self._new_stdin is not used anywhere else in this class.
     self._new_stdin = new_stdin
                if not new_stdin and fileno is not None:
                    try:
                        self._new_stdin = os.fdopen(os.dup(fileno))
                    except OSError, e:
                        # couldn't dupe stdin, most likely because it's
                        # not a valid file descriptor, so we just rely on
                        # using the one that was passed in
                        pass

This file descriptor leaks one fd for each.
It appears in the master branch as well, only its is being used by the
TaskExecutor. However, since its not being closed, it will be a file
descriptor leak there as well.
