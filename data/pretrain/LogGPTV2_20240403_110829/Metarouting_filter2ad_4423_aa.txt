## Abstract
The current landscape of routing protocols often fails to meet the specific needs of network engineers, leading to the use of BGP as an IGP despite its lack of convergence guarantees. The development, standardization, and deployment of new or even slightly modified routing protocols are challenging. We introduce Metarouting, an approach that defines routing protocols using a high-level, declarative language. By implementing an interpreter for this metarouting language on routers, network operators can define and use any protocol expressible in the language. This method separates protocol mechanisms (e.g., link-state, path-vector, adjacency maintenance) from routing policy (how routes are described and compared). The theoretical foundation is based on the Routing Algebra framework by Sobrinho [25], which allows for the construction of a large family of routing algebras. The key property of our Routing Algebra Meta-Language (RAML) is that it can automatically derive correctness conditions—guarantees of convergence with respect to the chosen mechanisms—for each expression defining a new routing algebra.

### 1. Good Routing Protocols Are Hard to Find
Modern routers come with a limited set of routing protocols, forcing network operators and engineers to solve their connectivity problems with these tools. For IP unicast routing, this typically means using static routing along with standardized dynamic protocols like RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP, or the proprietary EIGRP. Although BGP was designed as an inter-domain routing protocol, it is now frequently used as an intra-domain protocol by many large enterprises. This practice, while not ideal, is driven by the need for hierarchical structure, well-defined administrative boundaries, and expressive policy control, which traditional IGPs lack.

BGP's use as an IGP is problematic due to its lack of convergence guarantees and the potential for multiple stable solutions, some of which may be unintended. Developing and deploying new routing protocols, or even minor modifications, is extremely difficult, involving a rigorous standardization process and the challenge of creating well-behaved protocols with sophisticated policy control.

### 2. What Is a Routing Protocol?
A routing protocol can be decomposed into two main components: mechanism and policy. Mechanism refers to how routing messages are exchanged, adjacencies are maintained, and best routes are selected. Policy, on the other hand, describes the characteristics of a route, the method of comparing route preferences, and the application of local policies to routes.

#### 2.1 Routing Algebras
Routing algebras, as developed by Sobrinho [25], generalize shortest-path routing. A routing algebra \( A \) is defined as:
\[ A = \langle \Sigma, \preceq, L, \oplus, O \rangle \]
where:
- \( \Sigma \) is a set of signatures for describing paths.
- \( \preceq \) is a preference relation over signatures.
- \( L \) is a set of labels.
- \( \oplus \) is a label application function.
- \( O \) is an origination set.

The preference relation \( \preceq \) must satisfy completeness and transitivity. If \( x \preceq y \) but not \( y \preceq x \), then \( x \prec y \). If \( x \preceq y \) and \( y \preceq x \), then \( x \sim y \).

A special signature \( \phi \in \Sigma \) represents prohibited paths. For all \( \sigma \neq \phi \), \( \sigma \prec \phi \).

#### 2.2 Convergence Guarantees
Correctness in routing protocols ensures that, once all network changes cease, the protocol should determine stable, loop-free forwarding tables. In the algebraic approach, this is achieved by identifying certain algebraic properties and developing generic algorithms that are correct for any algebra with those properties.

For vectoring algorithms, strict monotonicity (SM) is a crucial property:
\[ \text{SM: For all } \sigma \in \Sigma - \{\phi\}, \text{ and for all } \lambda \in L, \sigma \prec \lambda \oplus \sigma. \]

A vectoring algorithm using an SM algebra will always be correct and free of forwarding loops.

### 3. The Routing Algebra Meta-Language (RAML)
RAML is a language for defining new and complex routing algebras from simpler ones. It includes base algebras and operators that take algebras as arguments and return new algebras. RAML is designed so that correctness conditions can be automatically derived for each expression defining a new algebra.

### 4. Examples and Applications
We provide examples of using metarouting to develop and implement a new IGP, showing how it can significantly reduce the effort required to create new routing protocols. We also present a metarouting model of BGP and discuss how this approach can aid in improving the protocol.

### 5. Future Directions
Future research will focus on further refining the metarouting approach and exploring its potential in various networking scenarios. Metarouting can contribute to the ongoing efforts to standardize and modularize routing software and hardware, providing a high-level, generic solution for the complex policy component of routing protocols.

This paper aims to bridge the gap between the IETF and the network operator community by enabling a natural division of labor, where metarouting itself could be standardized within the IETF, and metarouting specifications of routing protocols could be developed and standardized within the operator community.
