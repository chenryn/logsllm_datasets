To address your query regarding the cipher suites and protocols in use, and to safely remove support for TLS 1.1 from your endpoints, you can follow these steps:

### Determine Current Usage
1. **AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs):**
   - Enable access logging for your ELBs. This will allow you to store logs in an S3 bucket, where each log entry includes the TLS version and cipher suite used for each connection.
   - Refer to the official AWS documentation for detailed instructions on enabling and configuring access logs: [AWS ELB Access Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html).

2. **F5 Load Balancers:**
   - F5 also provides logging capabilities that can help you track the TLS versions and cipher suites used by clients.
   - You can configure F5 to log SSL/TLS handshake information, which will include the protocol and cipher suite details.
   - Consult the F5 documentation for specific configuration steps: [F5 SSL Logging](https://techdocs.f5.com/en-us/bigip-14-1-0/big-ip-tmos-administration-14-1-0.html#GUID-7C6A1E0D-8F9A-4F96-9C73-6E4B6D4E2A88).

### Analyze the Logs
- Once you have enabled logging, analyze the logs to determine if any clients are still using TLS 1.1.
- Look for entries where the `ssl_protocol` field indicates TLS 1.1.

### Work with Affected Users
- If you find that some clients are still using TLS 1.1, reach out to those users to inform them of the upcoming change and provide guidance on updating their systems to support TLS 1.2 or higher.
- Provide a clear timeline for the deprecation of TLS 1.1 to give users sufficient time to make the necessary updates.

### Remove Support for TLS 1.1
- After ensuring that no clients are using TLS 1.1, you can safely remove support for it from your endpoints.
- Update the configuration of your F5 and AWS ELBs to disable TLS 1.1 and only allow more secure protocols like TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.

### Additional Considerations
- In my experience, TLS 1.1 is rarely used, and TLS 1.0 is often used by bots that masquerade as real browsers. However, it is essential to verify this with your specific user base.
- Regularly review and update your security policies to ensure you are using the most secure protocols and cipher suites available.

By following these steps, you can confidently remove support for TLS 1.1 while minimizing disruption to your users.
