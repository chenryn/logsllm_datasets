c enc t o this sendee is that it displays a partial view of passwords associated with email addresses within 
a react possesses a decent data set of 8 billion credentials. This consists of a "Combo List", which will be

Passwords
Note that Leak Peek allows query by email address, username, password, keyword, and domain. We will use this 
resource again within upcoming chapters.
This sendee only provides a "true" or "false" identifying the presence of the email within a breach. The following 
URL submits a text-only query. This could verify an email address exists.
When searching an email address, Leaked Source displays the company which was breached and the approximate 
date when searching an email address. Below is a typical example.
This is a clone of the original We Leak Info site which was shut down by federal law enforcement agencies. A 
free account is required in order to access redacted details. The benefit here is that you also receive details about 
the breach source. Consider the following results.
WarFrame.com has: 1 result(s) found. This data was hacked on approximately 2016-04-09 
NeoPets.com has: 4 result(s) found. This data was hacked on approximately 2013-10-08
Cybcmews (qbemews.com/personal-data-leak-check)
The previous options only display the services which are associated with a target email account due to that data 
being stolen and publicly released. Passwords are not visible unless you pay a premium to Dehashed or Spycloud. 
Other sites present more robust options for displaying redacted and unredacted passwords for billions of 
accounts without any fees. I believe this is OSINT data, but your employer's policies may disagree. Let's 
approach cautiously with some demonstrations.

The first result is https://psbdmp.ws/WjwCkNL4. Clicking that link presents a dead page. However, modifying 
the URL as follows presents the original content.
I don't find PSBDMP as valuable as I did in previous years. However, I have had one investigation where Google 
had indexed a PSBDMP Pastebin hit when searching the Pastebin site through Google did not reveal the data. 
Next, we have their premium API. If you sign into the sendee with any Google account, you are presented an 
API key with ten free search credits. The following displays my typical usage.
I believe PSBDMP provides value for a very small niche of online investigators. I have only used it a few times, 
and still have a few free trial credits remaining.

Up to this point, all of these services display content received directly from known data breaches. PSBDMP 
takes a different approach. It monitors Pastebin for any posts including email addresses and/or passwords. 
There is no search field and a paid API key is required to see any results. However, we can sort through their 
archives with the following Google query.
I investigated a link to a client doxing at https://pastebin.com/qbkWTxCW. Pastebin had already removed the 
data and it was no longer accessible. I collected my trial API key and used it with my API key to create a custom 
URL of https://psbdmp.ws/api/v3/dump/qbkWTxCW?key=99a4911994688471f44443dfldf8ae6e. The 
result was the full text file archived from Pastebin by PSBDMP.
I now know the full password without creating any account or downloading any breach data. These services are 
only an introduction into breach data. We have a lot more to discuss later in the book.
The left column displays the typical redacted passwords and the right column displays SHA-1 hash values of the 
full passwords. I will explain much more detail about hash values later in the book. For now, this is a 
representation of the entire password, but we must decrypt the has to reveal the true password. There are severe 
online options, and I will explain my recommended approach with the data breaches chapter. For demonstration, 
I will use MD5 Decrypt (md5decrypt.net/en/Shal). I entered dc3245ecdcf2e40bl40el21a014cc37f70239f41 
into this website and received the following response.
You can search IntelligenccX for free and receive partial results, or create a free trial to see everything. In my 
experience, you are only limited to the number of burner "trial" email addresses with which you have access. 
While I have used this site for the free tier and an occasional free trial, I do not recommend any of the paid
The results here seem very similar to We Leak Info, but redundancy is always valuable. However, full passwords 
are available if you are willing to do some work. Consider the following results for test@email.com.

services. We will replicate the same results for free throughout the book and within our own tools. In fact, many 
of the tools on their site were copied verbatim without attribution from the tools which are included free here.
Avast offers a free search engine which identifies email addresses which appear within known data breaches and 
leaks. However, it should be avoided. If you enter any email address within this page, the account immediately 
receives an email from Avast about the search. Furthermore, Avast enrolls the email address into their invasive 
email newsletter database. Instead consider die "Friends Check" option at the following URL.
This website queries the same database maintained by Avast, but does not add the email address to their 
marketing campaigns or notify the account owner. This service will not identify any specific breach, but could 
be used as another email address verification option. If you receive a positive result, you know the email address 
has been used in the past and appears within a breach.
1 over 23,000 data breaches leaked from 
the previous CitOday website. This data contained hundreds of millions of exposed email addresses and 
passwords. Sites like Have I Been Pwned indexed the content, but none of the services identified which 
databases included specific email addresses. This site should present results unique from any other.
At the time of this writing, Scylla states that the service is currently offline but will return soon. I am skeptical, 
but I will keep this tutorial here in the event it returns. The previous options only display the services which are 
associated with a target email account due to that data being stolen and publicly’ released. Passwords are not 
visible unless you pay a premium to Dehashed or Spycloud. Scylla presents our most robust option for displaying 
unredacted passwords for billions of accounts without any fees. I believe this is OSINT data, but your era] 
policies may disagree. Let's approach cautiously with some demonstrations. The Scylla website is 
helpful. If you formulate a query’ incorrecdy, you are thrown to an error page and round of shaming. Placing 
search terms within the search field generates no results. You must submit any’ data as 
password, and keyword queries.
I search all email addresses connected to any’ investigation through every’ breach and leak resource listed here. 
You never know when one service may present a unique response. The results can be very’ telling. I have much 
more confidence that an email address is "real" when it appears within a breach. When I search an account 
which has never been seen within any breach, I assume it is either a brand new account or a "burner" address 
created for a single purpose. Note that any password details obtained could be accurate or completely wrong. 
Never attempt to log in to someone's account, as that would be considered computer intrusion. We should use 
these techniques only’ for passive intelligence gathering and never as credentials for access.

Self-identified as "The global archive of research material for investigative reporting", this sendee possesses an 
amazing amount of data. We wall dig into this resource within a later chapter, but we should acknowledge the 
email options here. A query’ of any email address immediately displays documents associated with the account. 
Additionally, any keyword search which provides results can be filtered by email address. Let's conduct an 
example. When I search for "inteltechniques", I receive two results, both of which appear to be PDF files from 
a journalism conference in 2017.1 could download and read the documents, or click the filters to the left. When 
I click on the "Email" option, I am notified that the following email addresses are included within these 
documents. This is great way to find additional email addresses which may be associated with your target
The results follow. Results from your query could represent additional email accounts owned by your target. 
This tells me that the person who owns the account of "PI:EMAIL", and has a password of "d4x96brjcnrx" 
in use on a Bitcoin forum, also likely uses "PI:EMAIL". This is called password recycling, and we will 
explore it much more later in the book.
As an example, I submitted "email:PI:EMAIL" within the search option, and was 
partial results in XML format.

We will revisit Scylla later and conduct multiple additional queries for other types of breach data. When scylla.sh 
is offline, try https://scylla.so/api or their IP address at http://44.235.17.188/api.
This service advertises the ability to display email addresses associated with a specific domain. However, the 
"Verifier" tool can also be valuable. This URL allows query of an individual email address. It immediately 
provides details similar to the first two services mentioned in this chapter, such as the validity of the address. 
From there, it displays any internet links which contained the email address within the content at some point. 
This appears to be sourced from their own database, as many links are no longer present on the internet, and 
not indexed by Google. 1 once searched my target email address here and confirmed that it was present within 
a forum associated with terrorism. The forum had recently been removed, but this evidence was permanent.

XLEK (xlek.com)
1 often find email addresses of my targets within this sendee, but it does not allow you to query by email address. 
We will need to rely on Google to assist. Assume your target is "PI:EMAIL". The following Google query 
produces over 200 results.
This premium service offers a free individual email lookup utility. It provides links to any social networks 
associated with the target email address. During a test search of a target's personal Gmail account, Many Contacts 
immediately identified the subject's Linkcdln, Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram, and Flickr accounts. 
Hyperlinks connect you direcdy to each profile page. This is one of my first searches when I know 1 possess a 
target's primary email account. I have experienced "no results" when using a common VPN provider, so expect 
some blockage.
This is a "White Pages" style of query and you will potentially see a name, city7, and telephone number associated 
with the account. The paid options are never worth the money.
These results include the actual target email address queried and anything else which also matches, such as 
"PI:EMAIL" and "PI:EMAIL". This overall strategy should apply toward any 
people search websites which display email addresses but do not provide a specific email search field.
Search My Bio (searchmy.bio)
This service was previously explained as an Instagram search tool. It also works well for email addresses. If your 
target included an email address within the biography section of their Instagram profile, it may have been indexed 
by Search My Bio. A search here for "@gmail.com" displays almost 500,000 Instagram profiles which include a 
Gmail address. This can be a quick way to find a person's Instagram page when you know the email used.
This data set is suspected to be generated from various marketing database leaks. Because of this, we usually 
receive much more complete results. Most results include full name, age, current home address, previous 
addresses, telephone numbers, family members, and business associations.
The majority of email addresses and usernames I have searched through this service returne no res . 
However, on occasion 1 received detailed results such as full name, address, phone number, an 'e 1C^ 
information. Although this is rare, I believe That's Them should be on your list of email and username scare 
resources.
Public Email Records (publicemailrecords.com)

address. This site has been scraped by many malicious actors and the data is commonly use to generate sp

This technique requires you to possess a free or paid ProtonMail account. It provides the easiest way to generate, 
new, and document the details. However, we can replicate this entire process without a requirement to log in 
to an account, but the results are not as reliable. Assume your target email is notmyemail@protonmail.com. 
First, we must query it to determine if it is present within the ProtonMail system with the following URL.
The result should display the creation date of the "Public key". This is usually the creation date of the email 
account, but not always. If your target generated new security keys for an account, you will see that date instead. 
Fortunately, this is very rare. Figure 15.02 displays the result when searching the email address of a colleague. I 
now know he has had this account since at least March 10, 2016. If the result displayed a recent date, 1 would 
suspect it was a new "burner" account created for a malicious purpose.

ProtonMail provides arguably the most popular secure and encrypted email service. Because of this, many 
criminals flock to it. In 2020, at least half of my criminal email investigations were associated with a ProtonMail 
account. When this happens, I want to know the date of account creation. The following steps should be 
conducted while logged in to a free ProtonMail account
The last set of digits (1623879788) represents an Epoch Unix Time Stamp, which was explained in Chapter

these URLs if you are connected to a VPN server which is abusing this process or you conduct multiple queries 
within a few seconds. Technically, they should obtain the same data from the same source, but I have had many 
failures. This is why I prefer the manual method explained at the beginning of this section.
If your browser prompts you to download a file titled "pubkey.asc", this indicates that the address exists. If you
