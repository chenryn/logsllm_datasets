The example of the `std::num` module speaks for itself. I can count at least
three grammatical forms among the function descriptions:
  * indicative form (`abs: Computes the absolute value.`);
  * imperative form (`acos: Compute the arccosine of the number.`);
  * noun phrase (`abs_sub: The positive difference of two numbers.` or `cos: Cosine function`).
The various style guides (https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-style-
guide, https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Doc-using-rustdoc and
http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/rustdoc.html) recommend writing
"sentences that begin with capital letters and end in a period" but do not
mention how the sentences should be formed.
I am willing to work on making all this coherent but a convention should be
fixed first.
