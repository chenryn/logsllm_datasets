There seems to be an issue with the versioning of the @types/pino package. The
latest is listed as `5.8.5`, however there was a release of `5.20.0` about 6
months ago which takes precedence versioning wise, so if users are using
`"@types/pino": "*"` they're getting the `5.20.0` version. Anyway that the
latest can just be bumped to something higher. Thanks.
