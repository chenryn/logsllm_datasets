### Certificates and Outbreak Management Systems

Before allowing new recruits to use an outbreak management system, it is essential to ensure that they have the necessary certifications. This is particularly important in the context of public health information and collaboration, as discussed in the Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'06) [0-7695-2716-7/06 $20.00 © 2006].

### Security and Privacy Requirements Analysis

**Figure 4.** Public health must carefully consider the interdependencies among concepts and relationships to protect population health while preserving individual privacy.

Historically, health information has been captured and retained on paper rather than in computers, and primarily exchanged by fax rather than over the Internet. As electronic retention and exchange become more commonplace, and as the interaction between healthcare providers and public health increases, security threats will become more pervasive and virulent.

Biological threat agents, such as microbes, viruses, and toxins, pose significant risks to the neurological, immunological, and endocrine systems of healthy individuals. These threats can affect large segments of the population and create national security risks due to potential social, economic, and political disruptions. To mitigate these risks, governments enact regulations and laws, such as the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of 2002, which mandates security measures for controlling biological agents and toxins, and for protecting the nation’s food and drug supplies and drinking water [37].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a Public Health Information Network (PHIN) certification process to ensure the preparedness of public health partners to respond to biological events with broad regional or national impact. The PHIN functional and technical requirements, based on industry data and systems standards, aim to establish a secure, coordinated, nationwide network of public health IT systems capable of efficiently acquiring, managing, analyzing, and disseminating public health information.

**PHIN Certification Requirements:**

1. **Automated Data Exchange:** Between public health partners.
2. **Use of Electronic Clinical Data:** For event detection and information.
3. **Manual Data Entry:** For event detection and management.
4. **Specimen Management and Exchange:** Including lab result information.
5. **Management of Possible Cases, Contacts, and Threat Data.**
6. **Analysis and Visualization.**
7. **Directories of Public Health and Clinical Personnel.**
8. **Public Health Information Dissemination and Alerting.**
9. **IT Protection and Critical Infrastructure Security.**

The objective for "IT security and critical infrastructure protection" is to provide assurances that sensitive or critical information and information systems are not lost, destroyed, misappropriated, or corrupted by internal or external malefactors, or by systems failure or catastrophic events. Additionally, information must be protected in ways that meet or exceed HIPAA standards [39].

### Security Safeguards

In general, all administrative and physical safeguards specified in the HIPAA Security Rule apply to public health. However, there are two notable exceptions:

1. **Facility and Equipment Protections:** May be outside the control of public health authorities in some contexts, such as outbreak investigations and response.
2. **Business Associate (BA) Contracts:** Public health authorities do not require BA contracts with covered entities who release Protected Health Information (PHI) to them. However, public health entities that are “covered entities” under HIPAA must establish BA contracts as required. Contract personnel who install software in covered entities for the purposes of extracting clinical data for public health surveillance may also require BA contracts.

**Table 1** identifies security requirements extracted from the nine PHIN certification areas and maps them to the technical safeguards required by the HIPAA Security Rule. Several PHIN requirements address availability and continuity of operations, which are not well represented in the HIPAA technical safeguards but are included in the administrative safeguards (e.g., protection from malicious software, data back-up).

The public health community has decided that, despite the inherent security weaknesses of the Internet, it is the best option for providing network connectivity among all public health partners. This decision is a good example of a risk decision: while the Internet increases risks to privacy, data integrity, and service continuity, its ubiquitous availability offers an immediate solution for enabling the necessary connectivity for disease surveillance, preparedness, health alerting, outbreak response, and collaboration.

To protect system-to-system, bi-directional data exchanges over the Internet, secure ebXML messaging is required. The two systems involved in the exchange are mutually authenticated using X.509 digital certificates, and the payload is encrypted using the receiver’s public key. Collaboration Protocol Agreements (CPAs) between messaging partners specify the transport protocol to use and the security constraints agreed upon by both parties. The CDC offers the PHIN Messaging System (PHINMS) as a reference implementation of secure ebXML messaging [40].

### Privacy Protection

Covered entities under HIPAA may release PHI to public health authorities without the explicit consent of the individual to whom the information applies. However, the information released must be the “minimum necessary” for the intended purposes, and the covered entity must keep a record of all such releases. The Privacy Rule identifies 18 data elements that must be removed for PHI to be considered “de-identified.” However, it does not require that information released to public health authorities be “de-identified.”

In practice, identifiable health information is routinely released only to local and state public health authorities. The PHIN certification requirements mandate that information provided to appropriate federal agencies be “linked but de-identified.” States must remove data elements that identify the individual before sending the information to federal agencies, and they must retain the ability to link the information back to the individual if necessary.

However, the PHIN certification requirements do not define “de-identified” or specify which data elements may be included or excluded for any given data exchange. Selecting which potentially identifiable data elements to include in any data-collection scenario or data exchange is a risk-management decision. This involves weighing the safety risk that excluding the data element poses for the population against the risk that including the element poses to individuals whose personal information may be disclosed. Both immediate and long-term impacts to the individual must be considered.

**Table 2** lists the 18 data elements identified in the Privacy Rule and indicates whether and how these data elements are included in data exchanges for the following three contexts:

1. **Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR):** Lab results to the states.
2. **NEDSS Reporting:** Case data from the states to the CDC.
3. **BioSense Capture and Reporting:** Clinical data from hospitals to the CDC.

Several observations can be made:
- **Individual Names:** Kept local; not sent to the CDC nor captured by BioSense.
- **Geographic Information:** More detailed than allowed by the Privacy Rule. Full 5-digit ZIP codes are included in case reports sent to the CDC and in the clinical information captured by BioSense. Lab reporting includes the full 9-digit ZIP code.
- **Case Identifiers, Specimen Identifiers, Order Numbers, and Result Tracking Numbers:** Included in reports that NEDSS systems send to the CDC. These data elements are important for linking back to individuals if necessary and maintaining the integrity of case reports.

### Summary and Conclusions

Amidst threats of pandemic avian influenza and bioterrorist attacks, public health surveillance and preparedness have never been more important. The capability to detect biological events, including emerging disease outbreaks and bioterrorist attacks, as near to the time of initial exposure as possible, can significantly reduce the health risk to the public. The ability for laboratories to electronically report test results suggesting potential health risks, for public health departments to efficiently exchange case reports across jurisdictional lines, and for public health authorities to disseminate guidance and alerts are all necessary to effectively manage health risks.

Against this backdrop, there is recognition of the very private nature of health information and the significant harm that could result from its unauthorized disclosure. This recognition motivated the rigorous requirements contained in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Yet, in an effort to effectively balance personal privacy against population safety, the Privacy Rule allows for certain exemptions, such as the release of PHI to public health authorities without explicit consent, provided it is the minimum necessary for the intended purpose.
