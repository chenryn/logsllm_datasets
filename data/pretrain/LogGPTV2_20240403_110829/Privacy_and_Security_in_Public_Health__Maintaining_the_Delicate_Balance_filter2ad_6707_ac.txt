electronic 
commonplace, 
between 
healthcare  providers  and  public  health  increases, 
security  threats  will  become  more  pervasive  and 
virulent.   
  Biological  threat  agents  such as  microbes,  viruses, 
and  toxins  threaten  the  neurological,  immunological, 
and  endocrine  systems  of  healthy  people,  posing 
health risks to  large  segments  of  the  population, and 
creating  national  security  risks  because  of  potential 
social, economic, and political disruptions.  To reduce 
these  risks,  governments  enact  regulations  and  laws, 
such  as  the  Public  Health  Security  and  Bioterrorism 
Preparedness  Response  Act  of  2002,  which  requires 
security measures for controlling biological agents and 
toxins, and for protecting the nation’s food and drug 
supplies and drinking water [37]. 
The  CDC  has  developed  a  PHIN  certification 
process to establish the preparedness of public health 
partners  to  respond  to  a  biological  event  that  could 
have  broad  regional  or  national  impact.    The  PHIN 
functional  and 
technical  requirements,  based  on 
industry  data  and  systems  standards,  are  intended  to 
enable  a  secure,  coordinated,  nationwide  network  of 
public  health  IT  systems  capable  of  efficiently 
acquiring,  managing,  analyzing,  and  disseminating

organizations  are  not  considered  “covered  entities” 
under  HIPAA  and  therefore  are  not  subject  to 
compliance.    However,  as  reflected  in  the  PHIN 
functional objective for IT security and infrastructure 
protection,  the  public  health  community  does  regard 
the  HIPAA  Security  and  Privacy  Rules  as 
its 
benchmark  for  security  and  privacy  protection  of 
public  health  information  and  services.    Thus  the 
HIPAA  Security  and  Privacy  Rules  can  provide  a 
useful  framework  for  examining 
the  protections 
needed and in place for public health.  In this Section, 
we examine public health security safeguards and de-
identification  policy  as  they  relate  to  the  HIPAA 
Security and Privacy Rules.

6.1  Security Safeguards 
In  general,  all  of  the  administrative  and  physical 
safeguards  specified  in  the  HIPAA  Security  Rule 
apply to public health.   Two notable exceptions are:   
(cid:131)  Facility and equipment protections may be outside 
the  control  of  public  health  authorities  in  some 
contexts,  such  as  outbreak  investigations  and 
response.   
(cid:131)  Public health authorities do not require Business 
Associate  (BA)  contracts  with  covered  entities 
who release PHI to them.  However, public health 
entities that are “covered entities” under HIPAA 
must  establish  BA  contracts  as  required.    Also, 
contract personnel who install software in covered 
entities for the purposes of extracting clinical data 
for  public  health  surveillance  may  require  BA 
contracts.     
Table  1  identifies  security  requirements  extracted 
from the nine PHIN certification areas and maps them 
to  the  technical  safeguards  required  by  the  HIPAA 
Security  Rule.    A  number  of  PHIN  requirements 
address  availability  and  continuity  of  operations  – 
security objectives that are not well represented in the 
HIPAA  technical  safeguards,  though  to  some  extent 
included 
the  administrative  safeguards  (e.g., 
protection  from  malicious  software,  data  back-up).  
Table  1  includes  an  additional  column  for  these 
availability-protection measures.

The  public  health  community  has  decided  that 
despite the Internet’s inherent security weaknesses, it 
is the best  option for providing network connectivity 
among  all  public health  partners.   This  decision  is  a 
good  example  of  a  risk  decision  represented  by  the 
model  introduced  earlier:    while  use  of  the  Internet 
does  increase  risks  to  privacy,  data  integrity,  and 
service continuity, its ubiquitous availability offers an 
immediate  solution  for  enabling  the  connectivity

  To  protect  system-to-system,  bi-directional  data 
exchanges over the Internet, secure ebXML messaging 
is required.  The two systems involved in the exchange 
are  mutually  authenticated  using  X.509  digital 
certificates,  and  the  payload  is  encrypted  using  the 
receiver’s  public  key. 
  Collaboration  Protocol 
Agreements  (CPAs)  between  messaging  partners 
specify the transport protocol to use and the security 
constraints  agreed  upon  by  both  parties.    The  CDC 
offers  the  PHIN  Messaging  System  (PHINMS)  as  a 
reference implementation of secure ebXML messaging 
[40]. 
To  assure  that  safety-critical  clinical  information 
and laboratory test results can be processed and acted 
upon  as  quickly  as  possible,  every  state  and  local 
health  department  must  be  able  to  electronically 
receive  and 
immediately  process  clinical  and 
laboratory information.  Further, to assure that clinical 
and laboratory information with national implications 
is  expeditiously  reported  to  federal  authorities,  states 
must be able to immediately de-identify and forward 
the information to appropriate federal agencies, while 
retaining the ability to link the information back to an 
individual should that become necessary.   
Lightweight  Data  Access  Protocol 
(LDAP) 
directories are required to support authentication and 
authorization  both  within  and  across  jurisdictions.  
Within  the  public  health  community,  the  distinction 
between  authentication  (i.e.,  proof  of  identity)  and 
authorization  (i.e.,  permission)  is  much  less  well 
understood  than  in  the  security  community,  and  the 
terms  are  often  misused.    This  misunderstanding  is 
manifested in the PHIN requirement for “X.509 digital

confusion  can  undermine  the  PHIN  objective  of 
facilitating  information  exchange.

Requirements  for  assurance  measures,  such  as 
architectural assurances, periodic risk assessment, and 
certification  and  accreditation,  are  generally  absent.      
Also, note that the PHIN requirement for “role-based, 
mandatory access control protocols” does not refer to 
the  label-based  controls  commonly  known  to  the 
security  community  as  “mandatory  access  control,” 
but  rather  role-based  control  that  is  “mandatorily” 
enforced.  
6.2  Privacy Protection 
the  explicit  consent  of 
As  discussed  in  Section  4  above,  covered  entities 
under  HIPAA  may  release  PHI  to  public  health 
authorities  without 
the 
individual to whom the information applies.  However, 
the  information  released  must  be  the  “minimum 
necessary” for the intended purposes, and the covered 
entity  must  keep  a  record  of  all  such  releases.    The 
Privacy Rule identifies 18 data elements that must be 
removed  for  PHI  to  be  considered  “de-identified.”  
However, it does not require that information released 
to public health authorities be “de-identified.”

that 
information  provided  to  appropriate  federal  agencies 
be “linked but de-identified.” That is, the states must 
remove  data  elements  that  identify  the  individual 
before sending the information to appropriate federal 
agencies, and they must be able to link the information 
back to the individual should they need to do so.   
requires 
However,  the  PHIN  certification  requirements  do 
not  define  “de-identified”  or  specify  which  data 
elements may be included, or which must be excluded, 
for  any  given  data  exchange. 
  Selecting  which 
potentially identifiable data elements to include in any 
data-collection  scenario  or  data  exchange  is  a  risk-
management  decision.    That  is,  deciding  which  data 
elements  must  be  removed  for  any  given  data 
collection  or  exchange  involves  weighing  the  safety 
risk  that  excluding  the  data  element  poses  for  the 
population, against the risk that including the element 
poses to individuals whose personal information may 
be  disclosed.    Not  only  immediate,  but  long-term 
impact  to  the  individual  must  be  considered.    For 
example, attributing a diagnosis of sinusitis, which can 
be  cured  within  14  days,  is  quite  different  from 
disclosing DNA data that are permanently attributable 
to an individual.    
Table 2 lists the 18 data elements identified in the 
Privacy  Rule  and  identifies  whether  and  how  these 
data elements are included in data exchanges for the 
following three contexts:   
1)  Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) of lab 
2)  NEDSS reporting of case data from the states 
results to the states 
to the CDC 
3)  BioSense  capture  and  reporting  of  clinical 
data from hospitals to the CDC 
Several observations can be made.  First, individual 
names are kept local; they are not sent to the CDC nor 
are  they  captured  by  BioSense. 
  Second,  more 
geographic  information  is  captured  than  the  Privacy 
Rule  allows  for  de-identification. 
  Whereas  the 
Privacy  Rule  allows  no  geographic  subdivisions 
smaller than a state and only the initial three digits of 
the  ZIP  code,  full  5-digit  ZIP  codes  are  included  in 
case  reports  sent  to  the  CDC  and  in  the  clinical 
information  captured  by  BioSense.    Lab  reporting 
includes  the  full  9-digit  ZIP  code.    The  inclusion  of

rely  heavily  on 
geographic  information  systems  (GIS)  to  help  them 
analyze diseases within the context of their geographic 
areas,  social  and  health  services  that  might  be 
available  within  a  particular  area,  and  the  natural 
environment  itself.  Analyzing  epidemiological  data 
within  a  geographic  context  can  reveal  trends  and 
interrelationships  that  would  be  more  difficult  to 
discover outside this context.

A  third  observation  is  the  inclusion  of  case

result

systems send to the CDC.  All of these data elements 
are important in linking back to individuals should that 
be necessary, and in maintaining the integrity of case 
reports.

results  suggesting  potential  health  risks,  for  public 
health departments to efficiently exchange case reports

authorities  to  disseminate  guidance  and alerts  are  all 
necessary to effectively manage health risks.
