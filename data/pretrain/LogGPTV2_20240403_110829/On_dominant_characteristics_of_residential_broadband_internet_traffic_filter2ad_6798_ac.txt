### 4.3 Does Port-Based Classification Work?
In many networking studies, it is often more practical or feasible to rely on TCP/IP transport information rather than deep packet inspection (DPI) systems. A critical question in such studies is the extent to which one can accurately infer application protocols based solely on the TCP/UDP port numbers used by connections. In adversarial settings, port-based classification has limited effectiveness due to the ease with which end systems can vary the ports they use. However, in non-adversarial situations, applications tend to use their assigned ports, making port-based classification more reliable.

Our DPD-based analysis, which is highly accurate for applications with full protocol parsers and still reasonably accurate with partial parsers, provides a solid ground truth for assessing the accuracy of port-based classification.

Previous studies have suggested that the rise of P2P traffic has made port-based approaches less effective. For example, Cho et al. [10] found that 79% of traffic on Japanese Internet backbone links uses unknown ports, and only 14% of bytes are transmitted over TCP port 80. Karagiannis et al. [26] in 2004 observed that P2P traffic increasingly uses dynamically negotiated ports. Kim et al. [23] found that the quality of port-based detection decreases as the fraction of P2P traffic increases.

However, our findings indicate that for current residential traffic, a port-based approach works quite well. Table 3 shows the performance of a port-based approach for dominant application layer protocols. For each protocol \( P \), the column \( VPD/VD \) represents the fraction of traffic volume on \( P \)'s default port(s) that DPD identifies as \( P \). The column \( VPD/VP \) shows the proportion of traffic on \( P \)'s port that would be correctly identified by inspecting only the port number.

**Interpretation of Table 3:**
- **HTTP:** 97.5% of HTTP traffic appears on port 80, and 98.1% of the traffic on port 80 is indeed HTTP. The largest non-HTTP application on port 80 is SHOUTcast, a streaming protocol similar to HTTP.
- **NNTP:** About two-thirds of NNTP traffic uses its default port (119), and nearly all (95.3%) of the traffic on this port is NNTP. The remaining NNTP traffic uses the well-known HTTP proxy port, 3128.
- **SSL-based protocols (HTTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SSMTP, NNTPS):** Approximately 75% of the traffic uses well-known ports.
- **RTSP:** More than 90% of RTSP traffic appears on its default port (554).

For P2P protocols, the situation is different. Many institutions block P2P traffic using port-based filters, leading these protocols to use non-standard, dynamically negotiated ports. However, one-third of detected eDonkey traffic uses its well-known ports, and finding traffic on these or BitTorrent ports generally indicates the presence of these protocols. Interestingly, 3% of BitTorrent traffic appears on eDonkey ports.

### 4.4 Traffic Symmetry
A common assumption in residential traffic is that downstream traffic (traffic coming into the local network) dominates upstream traffic (traffic going out from the local network). This assumption has influenced the design of ADSL and cable broadband services, which typically allocate more bandwidth to downstream traffic. Additionally, the prevalence of incoming connections affects the feasibility of carrier-grade network address translation (NAT).

In our datasets, we observe that most bytes appear in locally originated connections, with only 10% of traffic due to remotely originated connections. The largest fraction of incoming traffic is unclassified (33% of bytes), significantly higher than for outgoing connections. P2P traffic, particularly BitTorrent (28%) and eDonkey (17%), is the most significant contributor to incoming traffic. Voice-over-IP and streaming protocols also contribute significantly (10%). Incoming FTP data connections for active FTP sessions account for just over 1% of incoming traffic. We find that very few lines offer traditional Internet services like SMTP or HTTP, nor do they show significant involvement in DDoS or scanning activity (according to Bro’s scan detector).

When examining the symmetry of traffic, we find that 85% of all bytes come downstream, confirming the asymmetry assumption. This proportion is much higher than the 55% seen in Japanese backbone studies [19, 9], where P2P traffic contributed to greater symmetry. For our traffic, P2P applications show a 59% downstream share, resulting in an upload/download ratio of 41/59 ≈ 0.7, which is still less symmetric than the Japanese studies.

### 5. HTTP Usage
Given that HTTP dominates the traffic in our datasets, we now examine it more closely to characterize its usage. The resurgence of HTTP compared to P2P traffic can be attributed to two possible reasons: (i) HTTP offers popular high-volume content, and (ii) HTTP serves as a transport protocol for other application layer protocols, including P2P. Our analysis reveals that 25% of all HTTP bytes carry Flash Video, and RAR archives contribute another 14%. Thus, HTTP's predominance is largely due to its use in providing popular, high-volume content. We also find that HTTP is not significantly used for tunneling or P2P downloads.

#### 5.1 Content Type Distribution
We use Bro’s HTTP analyzer to parse anonymized HTTP headers and compute the size of each request/response pair. To identify content types, we examine the HTTP Content-Type header and analyze the initial part of the HTTP body using libmagic. We find over 1,000 different content types in HTTP headers, with 43% of all HTTP bytes (28% of requests) showing a mismatch between the Content-Type header and libmagic. Some discrepancies are minor and easy to resolve, such as the use of generic MIME types like `application/octet-stream`. In other cases, the sub-type differs, e.g., the Content-Type header may specify `image/gif`, while libmagic identifies it as `image/jpeg`.

When there is a disagreement, we use heuristics to determine the most likely true content type, giving priority to libmagic for well-known formats. Unresolved mismatches are reported as `x/x`, and generic or unidentified content types as `n/n`.

**Content Type Distribution (SEP Trace):**
- **Flash Video (video/flv):** 25%
- **RAR (application/rar):** 14.7%
- **Image types (GIF, PNG, JPEG):** 11.5%
- **Video types (other than Flash):** 7.6%
- **HTML (text/html):** 7.2%
- **Unknown or unidentifiable (n/n, x/x):** 18%

During the night, we observe a higher fraction of RAR objects and unknown objects, with a decrease in the relative popularity of HTML and image types, indicating bulk transfers rather than interactive browsing.

The general content type distribution is consistent across the APR trace, with some variations. For instance, the fraction of non-Flash video content increases to 9%, while audio content decreases. The fraction of unknown content types from the automated software site falls to 7.5% in the APR trace.

When separating lines with and without P2P protocol usage, we find that the content type distribution for non-P2P lines closely matches the overall distribution. Lines that use P2P have a smaller fraction of Flash Video (20%) and RAR archives (11%), and a larger fraction of unidentifiable content types (25%).

#### 5.2 Distribution Across Domains
We examine the distribution of HTTP traffic across domains, presenting the results for the SEP trace in Table 4. The byte distribution per domain closely follows a Zipf distribution, with the top 15 domains accounting for 43% of all HTTP bytes. Given that Flash Video is the most voluminous content type, it is not surprising to find video portals among the top domains. A Direct Download (DDL) provider also accounts for a significant fraction of HTTP traffic, with one provider dominating 93% of DDL traffic volume. Nighttime traffic shows a strong shift towards DDL sites, accounting for 24% of HTTP bytes during the 4 AM hour. DDL providers also originate almost 90% of all RAR bytes.

**Top Domains (Anonymized) for SEP Trace:**
- **Rank 1:** Direct Download Provider (15.3%)
- **Rank 2:** Video portal (6.1%)
- **Rank 3:** Video portal (3.3%)
- **Rank 4:** Video portal (3.2%)
- **Rank 5:** Video portal (3.0%)
- **Rank 6:** CDN (2.1%)
- **Rank 7:** CDN (1.8%)
- **Rank 8:** CDN (1.7%)
- **Rank 9:** Web portal (1.3%)
- **Rank 10:** Video Portal (1.2%)

#### 5.3 User-Agent Popularity
To assess the popularity of different web clients, we extract the User-Agent headers from HTTP requests, group them into broader categories, and rank these categories by transferred volume. Table 5 shows the results. Traditional web browsers account for more than 82% of HTTP traffic, with Firefox and Internet Explorer each having approximately 35% share, while Safari and Opera contribute 6% and 3%, respectively.

**Top User-Agents by Volume:**
- **Firefox 3:** 24.6%
- **MSIE 7:** 20.4%
- **MSIE 6:** 13.6%
- **Firefox 2:** 11.9%
- **Unclassified:** 5.5%
- **Network libraries:** 4.3%
- **Opera:** 2.8%
- **Download managers:** 2.5%
- **Streaming clients:** 1.6%
- **Safari:** 1.6%

We cross-checked these results with recent data from a major US broadband provider, Erman et al. [15], who report similar content type distributions, with video content corresponding to 32% of HTTP traffic and compressed file downloads (e.g., RAR) accounting for 16% of traffic.
