Question: Consider a scenario where an online shopping platform's server code contains a while-loop that creates a new user session for each iteration based on incoming requests without an upper limit. If an attacker sends a high volume of requests to trigger this loop, which of the following outcomes are likely?
"A": "The server may run out of memory, leading to a denial of service.",
"B": "The loop may improve system performance by efficiently handling multiple requests.",
"C": "Too many user sessions may lead to file descriptor exhaustion, causing service disruption.",
"D": "The attacker's IP address will be automatically blacklisted, preventing the attack."
Answer: AC
