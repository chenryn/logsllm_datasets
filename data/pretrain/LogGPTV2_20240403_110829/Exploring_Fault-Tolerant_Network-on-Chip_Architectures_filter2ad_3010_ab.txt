# Transmission and Retransmission Control in On-Chip Networks

## 1. Introduction
This document discusses the transmission and retransmission control mechanisms for on-chip network multiplexers (MUXES), focusing on error checking, retransmission control logic, and buffer architecture. The proposed architecture aims to handle both inter-router and intra-router errors, with a particular emphasis on link errors caused by channel disturbances such as crosstalk, coupling noise, and transient faults.

## 2. Proposed Architecture
### 2.1. Buffer Architecture
The proposed transmission/retransmission buffer architecture is illustrated in Figure 3. This architecture includes:

- **Transmission Control Signals** and **Error Check Unit** for MUXES.
- **Retransmission Control Logic** to manage retransmissions.
- **Transmission and Retransmission Buffers** (FIFO and Barrel Shifter) to store flits temporarily.

### 2.2. Flit Flow Example
Figure 4 provides an example of the flit flow during a retransmission event. If a header flit (H1) is corrupted during link traversal, the receiving router drops the subsequent two flits (D2 and D3). A clean copy of H1 is stored in the retransmission buffer, and upon detection of the error, a NACK signal is sent to the transmitting node. The corrected flit (H1) arrives within three clock cycles, minimizing the latency penalty.

## 3. Error Handling Techniques
### 3.1. Link Errors
Link errors are primarily caused by channel disturbances and have been extensively studied. Two main approaches to handling link errors are:

- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: Uses Error Correcting Codes (ECC) to correct single-bit errors and detect double-bit errors.
- **Retransmission Schemes**: Can be either End-to-End (E2E) or Hop-by-Hop (HBH).

#### 3.1.1. Hybrid Techniques
Hybrid techniques combine both error correction and retransmission, providing more robust protection. For example, Single Error Correction and Double Error Detection (SEC/DED) codes can correct one error and detect double-bit errors, invoking retransmission if necessary.

### 3.2. Header Flit Errors
Both FEC and E2E retransmission schemes suffer from header flit errors. If the destination address is corrupted, the packet may be routed incorrectly, leading to additional network traffic. HBH retransmission, which checks data at each router along the path, is more effective in handling such errors.

## 4. Flit-based HBH Retransmission Scheme
### 4.1. Scheme Overview
Our proposed minimal-overhead HBH retransmission scheme requires a 3-flit-deep retransmission buffer per virtual channel. This buffer accounts for the link traversal delay, error checking delay, and NACK propagation delay. The retransmission buffer is implemented as a barrel-shift register, simplifying the control logic.

### 4.2. Comparison with Existing Schemes
- **[23, 24]**: Use a single transmission buffer with pointers, complicating the logic and incurring wiring overhead. They use both ACK and NACK signals.
- **[25]**: Uses the Unique Token Protocol (UTP) but requires at least two copies of a packet, increasing buffer occupancy and flow control complexity.

### 4.3. Performance Evaluation
Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the latency and energy overhead of different error handling techniques. The proposed HBH retransmission scheme maintains almost constant average latency even up to a 10% error rate. The retransmission occurs only between two adjacent hops, minimizing the impact on overall network traffic.

## 5. Deadlock Recovery
Deadlock recovery is another critical aspect of the proposed architecture. The retransmission buffer is also used as an essential component of the deadlock recovery scheme, further subsidizing the area and power overhead.

## 6. Conclusion
The proposed flit-based HBH retransmission scheme, combined with FEC, provides an efficient and robust solution for handling link errors in on-chip networks. The minimal overhead and low latency penalties make it a suitable choice for practical implementations.
