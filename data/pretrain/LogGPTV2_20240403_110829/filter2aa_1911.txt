CYBER-CRIMES ARE CONVENIENT BECAUSE:
• Lack of IT laws
• Lack of L.E. international cooperation
• ISPs are non-transparent
CYBER-PROTESTS ARE CONVENIENT BECAUSE:
• General lack of security
• No need to protest on streets
• No direct confrontation with L.E.
Zone-H.org 
CYBER-CRIMES WILL NEVER STOP BECAUSE:
• Inherent slowness of the Institutions
• The Internet is getting more complicated
• Software producers are facing a market challenge

UMTS vs Wi-Fi (P.A.P.) why not?
• 80.000.000.000 USD paid for UMTS 
licenses and tight development plans will 
force Telecoms to spread the UMTS service 
as fast as possible offering connectivity at a 
very convenient price.

The UMTS 3G platform
• Videoconference
• Full multi-media platform
• Data bank
• Office files
• Mobile computing
• Web browsing

How crackers will exploit UMTS
• Using OS security flaws
• Through open ports
• Virus (mail, downloaded prgs)
• Trojan (mail, downloaded prgs)
• Using components flaws (media player
browser, active sync etc.)
• Webserver flaws
• Exploiting application

DIRECT DAMAGES
• Loss of precious information 
• Denial of service (received)
• Denial of service (attack), $$$ loss
• Espionage (loss of documents)
• Eavesdropping (audio and video)
• Unauthorized online shopping
• Bank account unauthorized access

windows beta 
webserver for pocket 
pc: full remote access
The default installation of 
windows beta webserver allows 
an attacker to gain full remote 
access without authentication 
simply logging to 
http://attacked_host/admin
Privacy threat
• Cyber-stalking (GPS)
• Cyber-stalking (last node ID)
• Direct targeting . The wideband nature of the 
UTRA/FDD facilitates the high resolution in 
position location. The duration of one chip 
(3.84Mcps) correspond to approximately 78 
meters in propagation distance. If the delay 
estimation operates on the accuracy of 
samples/chip then the achievable maximum 
accuracy is approximately 20 meters.

CYBERFIGHTER IN RETALIATION OF THE 
KASHMIR TERRITORY OCCUPATION …
Are we now scared about 
the implementation of 
these new technologies?
What system will be invented to let us 
feel secure and keep our privacy safe?
Is there anyone who can help me to get 
rid of these techno-nightmares?
