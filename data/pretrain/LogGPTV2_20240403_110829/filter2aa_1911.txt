**Speaker: SyS64738, www.zone-h.org**

#### Introduction
Zone-H.org is a well-known platform that tracks and reports on web intrusions, providing a valuable indicator of the internet's vulnerability. This presentation will explore the emerging threats in the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) mobile phone platform and the broader implications for cybersecurity.

#### Zone-H.org: The Internet Thermometer
Zone-H.org serves as a thermometer for the internet, measuring the frequency and severity of digital attacks. The following data illustrates the increasing number of digital attacks since 2002:

- **2002-01:** 1,600
- **2002-02:** 1,811
- **2002-03:** 2,341
- **2002-04:** 3,652
- **2002-05:** 3,907
- **2002-06:** 3,468
- **2002-07:** 4,175
- **2002-08:** 5,279
- **2002-09:** 9,884
- **2002-10:** 14,575
- **2002-11:** 12,739
- **2002-12:** 16,393
- **2003-01:** 16,724
- **2003-02:** 15,638
- **2003-03:** 16,924
- **2003-04:** 17,329
- **2003-05:** 25,273

#### Attack Techniques and Tools
The most commonly exploited vulnerabilities by attackers in 2003 include:
- WebDAV
- Samba
- FrontPage Extensions
- PHP Nuke
- OpenSSL

#### Defacement Reasons
Defacements are often motivated by various factors:
- For fun
- Revenge
- Political reasons
- Challenges
- Wannabe hackers
- Patriotism

#### Defacements by Operating System
The distribution of defacements across different operating systems from 2002 to 2003 shows a significant trend:
- **Windows 98/NT**
- **Windows 2000**
- **Windows XP/.NET/2003**
- **Linux**
- **BSD family**
- **Solaris family**

#### Cyberfights
Cyberfights are often related to geopolitical events and social issues:
- Kashmir-related
- Iraq war-related
- Code Red release-related
- Palestine-Israel conflict
- Anti-globalization movements

#### Why Cyber-Crimes and Cyber-Protests Are Convenient
**Cyber-Crimes:**
- Lack of IT laws
- Lack of international law enforcement cooperation
- Non-transparent ISPs

**Cyber-Protests:**
- General lack of security
- No need to protest on the streets
- No direct confrontation with law enforcement

#### Why Cyber-Crimes Will Never Stop
- Inherent slowness of institutions
- Increasing complexity of the internet
- Market challenges faced by software producers

### The UMTS 3G Platform

#### Features of UMTS
- Videoconferencing
- Full multimedia platform
- Data bank
- Office files
- Mobile computing
- Web browsing

#### Potential of UMTS
UMTS devices will have the capability to perform tasks similar to PCs, powered by operating systems like Windows, Linux, and other commercial OSs.

#### Conceptual Weaknesses in UMTS
- Weakly built operating systems
- Memory-stacked applications and data
- Vulnerabilities in the memory stack

#### How UMTS Works
- **USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module)**
- **Wireless Node**
- **Radio Network Controller**
- **ATM Network**
- **Mobile Switching Center**
- **Visiting Location Register**
- **Encrypted Area**
- **Telephone Network**

#### Exploitation of UMTS
- Using OS security flaws
- Through open ports
- Viruses (email, downloaded programs)
- Trojans (email, downloaded programs)
- Using component flaws (media player, browser, ActiveSync, etc.)
- Web server flaws
- Application-level exploits

#### Direct Damages
- Loss of precious information
- Denial of Service (received and attack)
- Financial losses
- Espionage (loss of documents)
- Eavesdropping (audio and video)
- Unauthorized online shopping
- Unauthorized access to bank accounts

#### Privacy Threats
- Cyber-stalking (GPS, last node ID)
- Direct targeting (high-resolution position location)

#### Home Automation and UMTS
- **Home Automation Systems (EIBA, X10)**
- **Internet Refrigerator** (low-spec PC with modified Windows 98)
- **Internet Oven** (potential for remote control and sabotage)

#### Conclusion
The implementation of new technologies like UMTS brings both opportunities and risks. Ensuring security and privacy in these systems is a critical challenge. For those concerned about these "techno-nightmares," perhaps a simpler, more traditional lifestyle might be appealing.
