User: Please describe the types of databases that are currently popular, and analyze which type of database should be used in which situations.
Assistant: The most popular types of databases today include relational and non-relational databases. 1. Relational database: A relational database is a table-based database that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to process data. This type of database is suitable for applications that require strict assurance of data consistency and integrity, and applications that require real-time interaction. 2. Non-relational database: A non-relational database is a database that uses key-value pairs to store data. This type of database is suitable for applications that need to process large amounts of unstructured data, such as social media, Internet of Things, and machine learning. Which type of database should be selected according to the specific application scenario. For applications that strictly guarantee data consistency and integrity, or applications that require real-time interaction, it is generally more appropriate to use a relational database. For applications that need to process large amounts of unstructured data, it is more appropriate to use a non-relational database. At the same time, factors such as reliability, performance, scalability, security, and cost also need to be considered when selecting a database.
