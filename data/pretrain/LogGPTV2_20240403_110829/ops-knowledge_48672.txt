To effectively implement CIS Control 7.5, which focuses on performing automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Regular Scanning Schedule**: Conduct automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets at least quarterly, or more frequently if the risk profile or operational needs dictate.

2. **Comprehensive Scanning**:
   - **Authenticated Scans**: Perform authenticated scans to gain a deeper and more accurate assessment of vulnerabilities by leveraging system credentials.
   - **Unauthenticated Scans**: Conduct unauthenticated scans to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited without user credentials.

3. **Use SCAP-Compliant Tools**: Utilize a Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)-compliant vulnerability scanning tool to ensure that the scans are consistent with industry standards and best practices.

4. **Asset Type and Security Function**:
   - **Asset Type**: This control specifically targets applications within the organization.
   - **Security Function**: The primary security function is to identify potential vulnerabilities, thereby enabling the organization to take proactive measures to mitigate risks.

By following these procedures, an organization can enhance its ability to detect and address vulnerabilities in its internal enterprise assets, ultimately improving its overall security posture.
