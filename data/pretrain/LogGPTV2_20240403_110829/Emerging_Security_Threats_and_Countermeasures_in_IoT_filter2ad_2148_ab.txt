resources,  computing  power  and  communication 
capability.  With  the  nature  of  lightweight  and  portability,  the 
communication capability of wearable devices is mostly in a short 
distance.  Short-range  wireless  communication  (i.e.  domestic 
communication),  such  as  Bluetooth  and  Zigbee  [8],  relies  on 
pairing  objects  prior  to  data  exchange.  For  wearable  devices  to 
extend  the  communication range  (i.e.  foreign  communication), a 
delegator  is  required  to  relay  the  data  traffic.  Delegator  is 
normally  referred  to  as  the  gateway  of  communication  [9].  For 
wearable devices made for mobility, the handheld device such as 
mobile  phone  is  a  suitable  gateway  to  relay  data.  On  the  other 
hand,  for  home/office  appliances,  a  hotspot  such as  wireless  AP 
(Access  Point)  is  a  suitable  candidate  to  relay  data.  Figure  1 
illustrates  the  typical  topology  configuration  for  both  long 
distance and short distance communication. 
For  domestic  communication  authentication,  e.g.  Bluetooth  and 
Zigbee, basic security is provided in the link layer during object 
pairing  where  password  is  required.  Once  the  object  is  paired, 
encryption  is  applied  when  data  has  been  exchanged  wirelessly 
[8].  On  the  other  hand,  foreign  communication  authentication, 
section  4  will  enumerate  a  number  of  applicable  authentication 
models. 
Since  IoT  comes  at  a  massive  scale  of  objects,  naming  of  the 
objects becomes  more  complex.  Due to  the heterogeneity  of  the 
objects  and  the  network,  conventional  Internet  naming  and 
identification  will  not  be  applicable  [3].  Uniquely  naming  the 
objects is one of the main challenges in IoT to be resolved before 
addressing  object  authentication.  GS1  [10]  suggested  that  the 
DNS  naming scheme  can  be the naming  basis  of  IoT  given that 
2IoT  is  to  be  deployed  on  the  Internet.  Object  Naming  Service 
(ONS) [10] is part of GS1 EPCglobal [11] architecture framework 
that leverages  DNS to locate authoritative metadata and services 
with given Electronic Product Code (EPC).  The EPC is designed 
for the purpose of providing universal unique identity. ONS can 
also be integrated into DNS as a sub-domain of DNS. Therefore, 
the Internet becomes the communication medium for the device-
naming domains.

to  exchange  data. 
As  an  illustrator  of  the  future  Internet  architecture,  US  NSF 
launched Future Internet Architecture Project (FIA Project) [12]. 
As  a  core  sub-project  of  FIA  Project,  L.  Zhang  et  al.  proposed 
novel  "Named  Data  Networking  (NDN)"  [13]  which  moves  the 
network architecture from host-centric to data-centric. According 
to NDN, the identification and network routing are based on the 
name  of  the  object  instead  of  using  conventional  IP  address. 
Naming in NDN is in a hierarchical structure, and is applicable to 
hierarchical  nature  of  the  current  computer  network  structures. 
NDN has great impact, but is still in its infancy.  There are still 
many new challenges, such as efficiency, name validation, signing 
key management, object authentication, and other security issues. 
These challenges remain unsolved and raise concerns. 
3.  IOT COMMUNICATION SCENARIOS 
In this section, we will discuss various  communication scenarios 
for  IoT  applications 
  To  model  IoT 
communication  scenarios,  the  administration  domains  of  objects 
can  be divided  into domestic  and  foreign  domains,  based  on  the 
ownership  of  objects.  An  object  of  the  domestic  domain  is 
administrated and owned by the home members while the object 
of  a  foreign  domain  is  administrated  and  owned  by  outsiders. 
Each object is represented as a peer.  A domestic peer represents 
an object that is registered to the domestic domain, while a foreign 
peer  represents  an  object  that  is  registered  to  a  foreign  domain. 
The  communication  of  “things”  can  be  formalized  into  three 
scenarios,  namely,  basic  scenario,  extended  scenario,  and  cloud 
scenario.  Details are given below. 
3.1  Basic Communication Scenario 
This  basic  communication  scenario  is  regarded  as  domestic 
communication  where  wearable  devices,  smart  furniture,  and 
smart  appliance  exchange  data  within  a  closed  network 
environment, such as home or organization (shown in Figure 2). 
For  wearable  devices  that  are  incapable  of  making  direct 
connection to an access point beyond the communication range, a 
delegator such as handheld device can play the role to relay data 
traffic to the access point so that the data can be transmitted to the 
destination. This communication scenario takes place in a closed 
network often referred as local area network (LAN), and the main 
challenges to data retrieval are as follows: 
Figure 2, IoT communication in home/organization domain. 
3.2  Extended Communication Scenario 
Mobility is one of the features of wearable devices. Data must be 
exchangeable  whilst  a  wearable  device  is  on  the  move.  Thus, 
public  network (i.e. the  Internet) is used  to relay  the  exchanged 
data. Depending on the methods that data is exchanged and stored, 
network  configurations  can  be  divided  into  two  types.  Figure  3 
depicts  a  simple  network  configuration  for  external  resource 
access where resource and data distribution are decentralized. In 
this type of configuration, two gateways are employed to support 
communicate  between 
smart 
furniture/appliances.  A  gateway  supports the local area  network, 
while the mobile handheld device supports data relay for mobile 
wearable devices.   As data  exchanged,  the  two  gateways  handle 
data forwarding. 
the  wearable  devices  and 
Figure 3, IoT communication over public network. 
Figure 4 illustrates the network configuration where resource and 
data are centralized. Although the two network configurations are 
alike,  the  actual  communication  takes  place  using  different 
approaches.  In  this  approach, the  data  resource  is  centralized  so 
that the objects do not communicate directly. All exchanged data 
is  pushed  and  pulled  from  a  central  storage  (i.e.  the  data  pod). 
Regardless of centralized or decentralized network configurations, 
challenges to data retrieval are listed below:

3.3  Cloud Communication Scenario 
Cloud computing has been a hot topic in the recent years.  Cloud 
computing  will  continue  to  thrive  as  IoT  grows.  The  scenario 
involves vendors providing data storage service where data can be 
accessed from anywhere (shown in Figure 5). At the same time, 
data  is  replicated  to  prevent  single  point  failure  and  ensure 
efficiency.  The  pushed  data  in  the  cloud  service  can  also  be 
computed  for  analytical  purpose  or  for  personal  service 
recommendations.  Unlike  the  aforementioned  scenarios,  the 
gateways  of  wearable  devices,  smart  furniture,  and  smart 
appliances are only used to  collect data for the cloud storage. In 
this context, data authentication is still needed to avoid pollution 
while  transmitting  collected  data  over  the  Internet  to  the  cloud. 
The challenges to data collection is as follows:

  Eavesdrop resistance over wireless networks

through the Internet. 
4.1  Authentication by Gateway 
In 
the  authentication 
the  authentication-by-gateway  model, 
process relies on the gateway between the communication parties. 
To communicate with a domestic peer, a foreign peer first needs 
to be authenticated by the domestic gateway. Being authenticated, 
the subsequent exchanged data from the foreign peer is directed to 
the destination until the session is terminated. This authentication 
process is repeated for each communication session whenever the 
communication  parties  exchange  data  via  the  Internet.  The 
authentication method can be as simple as ID-password scheme or 
any  other  scheme as  long  as it  provides the  proof  of  authorized 
identity. Similar to authentication-by-gateway model, research [14] 
has  discussed  a  practical  IoT  communication  example  based  on 
CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) [15] that the resource-
constrained  objects  cooperate  with 
in  UCN 
(Unconstrained Network) to achieve data authentication. The pros 
and cons of authentication-by-gateway scheme are listed below: 
  Pros 
the  gateway 
o  The authentication method for foreign peers is independent 
of the authentication method for domestic peers. 
o  Peer  protection  is  centralized  in  the  gateway.  Since  the 
gateway  should  be  relatively  powerful 
terms  of 
computation,  the  protection  can  be  designed  to  be  more 
complex  to  strengthen  the  security  functionalities.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  protection  for  the  domestic  peers  can  be 
designed to be lightweight. In this way, it is more applicable 
to the domestic peers that may have less computation power 
and requires less security functionalities. 
in 
o  Single point failure, such as compromised gateway, exposes 
all the peers to threats. 
  Cons 
o  The  gateway  can  be  a  bottleneck  since  it  is  in  charge  of 
authenticating  network  traffic  from  communicating  peers. 
At the same time, the gateway is also the only  ingress and 
egress point of public network traffic. Thus, network traffic 
congestion problem is inevitable.

4.  AUTHENTICATION MODEL 
In this section, authentication models are introduced to cope with 
the challenges incurred in various communication scenarios. Each 
authentication  model  is  designed  in  an  attempt  to  address  the 
challenges  in  a  communication  scenario.    These  challenges  are 
further elaborated as follows. For domestic communication, O2O 
(Object-to-Object) communication is applied to wearable devices 
and  handheld  devices.    Due  to  resource  constraints,  wearable 
devices  rely  on  more  powerful  computational  objects,  such  as 
handheld  device, 
relay  data.  To  authenticate,  pairing 
mechanism is adopted when two objects are making connection. 
At  the  pairing  stage,  a  simple  password  or  pre-shared  key  is 
supplied  before  initializing  the  communication.  When  the  data 
exchange  begins,  symmetric  cryptosystems  are  suitable  for 
preventing eavesdropping over wireless communication. For LAN 
communication,  the  conventional  Wi-Fi  protecting  schemes  are 
sufficient where a passphrase is used to authenticate the object to 
the  network  and  prevent  eavesdropping  over  wireless 
communication.  These  authentication  schemes  cover  domestic 
communication while the following authentication schemes cover 
to 
Applying  this  authentication  model  to  the  IoT  communication 
model over public network, the gateway (i.e. the access points and 
the  handheld devices)  must  be  capable  of  authenticating  foreign 
peers. An example of  IoT applications is the IoT data collection 
and integration for e-health. In a health caring scenario, an elder 
may  wear  a  smart  bracelet  continuously  collecting  his  heartbeat 
and  GPS  location  information.  As  the  mobile  gateway,  a  smart 
phone  may  be  needed  to  collect raw  data  from  the bracelet  and 
upload  them  to  a  health  care  cloud.  In  this  scenario,  the  smart 
phone  may  communicate  with  the  bracelet  through  secure 
Bluetooth  pairing  and  authenticate  each  other  with  the  cloud 
through  a  DTLS  [16]  connection.  This  authentication  model 
reduces  data  authentication  workload  on  the  communicating 
objects.    Therefore,  it  is  more  suitable  for  resource-constrained 
objects such as the aforementioned bracelet.  It is also applicable 
to centralized communication over public network. However, the 
downside of this authentication model is that the gateway is busy 
with processing authenticated sessions while forwarding network 
traffic to the public network. For standard home gateway such as 
home  routers  and  access  points,  the  high  computing  workload 
may  be  minor.  However,  it  can  be  problematic  to  a  gateway 
powered by battery. 
44.2  Authentication by Security Token 
In  this  authentication  model,  the  gateway  is  responsible  for 
initiating the authentication session when a foreign peer begins to 
exchange  data  with  a  domestic  peer.  At  initiation,  the  gateway
