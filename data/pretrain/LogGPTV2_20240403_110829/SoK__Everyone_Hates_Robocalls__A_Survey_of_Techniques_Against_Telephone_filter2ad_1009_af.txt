Table II: Summary of various anti-spam solutions using a combination of standalone techniques.
Baumann et al. [109] presented a survey of potential
solutions to SPIT. The paper provided an overview and
classiﬁcation of SPIT prevention methods based on detec-
tion using Signaling versus Voice and order-based Before
Call versus After/While Call. The paper also proposed a
Biometric Framework for SPIT Prevention as a way to bind
identities to each caller.
Phithakkitnukoon et al. [110] presented a survey focused
on ﬁve primary types of VoIP attacks, SPIT being one of
them. The authorized provided an introduction to the basic
knowledge of VoIP systems and its available security tools,
and summarized a list of proposed solutions for SPIT from
previous literature.
Quinten et al. [111] presented a survey evaluating the
techniques to prevent and reduce SPIT. The authors eval-
uated the effectiveness of techniques by dividing them into
four categories: unsuitable techniques, techniques with po-
tential, suitable techniques, and combinations of techniques.
Dantu et al. [112] presented a survey discussing the
attacks and solutions in VoIP, with VoIP Spam and Phishing
being one of the attacks. The authors reviewed previous
work addressing all types of VoIP attacks and proposed a
high-level security architecture to make the VoIP infrastruc-
ture more secure and robust.
Dritsas et al. [113] presented a survey reviewing a list
of SPIT identiﬁcation criteria that can be used by anti-SPIT
mechanisms and identiﬁed the different detection stages. The
authors propose two generic categories of SPIT identiﬁcation
criteria: SIP Message criteria and SIP User Agent criteria.
They also proposed a two-fold evaluation framework for
discovering possible SPIT messages.
Marias et al. [114] presented a survey assessing the
threats and vulnerabilities that the SIP protocol introduces.
The authors also reviewed existing anti-SPIT mechanisms
and classiﬁed them into three classes: Prevent, Detect, and
Handle. The paper also proposes a list of qualitative and
quantitative criteria to assess the effectiveness of the anti-
SPIT countermeasures.
Khan et al. [115] presented a survey reviewing various
existing methods for preventing spam in IP telephony. The
paper also presented a discussion on the implementation
costs of different types of techniques, and commented that
no single technique is sufﬁcient and therefore a framework
of multiple techniques is recommended.
Rosenberg et al. [116] presented an open memo reviewing
various solutions that might be possible to deal with SIP
spam. The author also presented some borrowed techniques
that have been employed to deal with email spam. In
conclusion, the author recommends using identity related
techniques, while also commented that identity techniques
may be vulnerable when a SIP request without an authenti-
cated identity cannot know whether the request lacked such
an identity because the originating domain didn’t support it,
or because a man-in-the-middle removed it.
In general, most existing survey papers focus on tech-
niques against SPIT or more speciﬁcally spam in the SIP

protocol. This paper is focused on techniques to address
spamming in the PSTN telephony network. Some techniques
for SPIT are not applicable to PSTN due to protocol dif-
ferences. As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst survey
paper speciﬁcally addressing spam calls directed to the
PSTN telephony network. In terms of evaluation differences,
we are the ﬁrst
to propose a taxonomy to classify the
existing standalone techniques into three categories, the ﬁrst
to evaluate the standalone techniques based on three sets of
assessment criteria, and the ﬁrst to outline the three strategies
of combining standalone techniques.
VIII. CONCLUSION
From analyzing and evaluating the existing solutions that
attempt to address telephone spam, we reach the conclusion
that there is no universally acceptable solution to telephone
spam. Every approach thus far has different tradeoffs, specif-
ically between usability, deployability, and robustness.
From our analysis of the telephone spam ecosystem and
defensive techniques, we believe that usability is the most
important criteria for evaluating a defense. Unlike email,
which can be delayed or possibly lost due to a false positive,
telephony solutions have a high bar for user acceptance,
and we believe that users will not adopt techniques that
impose excessive burden on both the caller and recipient.
Therefore, future research into this area must consider the
usability of the defense from both the caller and the recipient
perspective.
We believe that one promising avenue of research is
using a combination of techniques, which should improve
on the robustness of standalone techniques, and potentially
each technique could address the weaknesses of the others.
However, as the telephony system has real-time immediacy
constraints, care must be taken so that the combination of
techniques will not degrade the user experience due to higher
complexity. Our intuition leads us to recommend combining
no more than two standalone techniques, as we observed that
a good balance of usability, deployability, and robustness
could be achieved by using two standalone techniques.
One glaring issue that continually reoccurs when analyz-
ing the telephone spam ecosystem is caller ID spooﬁng. We
believe that the key to combating telephone spam is to make
the caller ID trusted and veriﬁable, while making minimal
changes to existing infrastructure. For instance, from our
evaluation of Call Request Header Analysis techniques,
they provide the best overall usability and deployability,
however they suffer from robustness due to the spammer’s
ability to spoof the caller ID. If caller ID spooﬁng can
be effectively prevented, then we believe that Call Request
Header Analysis would satisfy all of our evaluation criteria.
Telephone spam is poised to increase signiﬁcantly,
defrauding consumers of billions of dollars. Therefore, an
effective telephone spam defense is critical. However, the
techniques and approaches that were effective in combating
email spam are inappropriate when applied to telephone
spam. We attribute this to differences not only in the
technology used, but more fundamentally to the type of
communication. This is why a survey of the telephone
spam area is necessary: to highlight these differences and
to deﬁne the ideal criteria for telephone spam defenses. We
hope that this paper provides a framework to help guide
and shape future telephone spam defenses.
