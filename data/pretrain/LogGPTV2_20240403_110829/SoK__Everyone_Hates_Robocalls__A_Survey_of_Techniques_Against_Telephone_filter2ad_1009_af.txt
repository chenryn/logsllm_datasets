### Table II: Summary of Various Anti-Spam Solutions Using a Combination of Standalone Techniques

**Baumann et al. [109]**
- **Overview**: Surveyed potential solutions to SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony).
- **Classification**: Based on detection methods using Signaling vs. Voice and order-based Before Call vs. After/While Call.
- **Proposal**: Introduced a Biometric Framework for SPIT Prevention to bind identities to each caller.

**Phithakkitnukoon et al. [110]**
- **Focus**: Surveyed five primary types of VoIP attacks, including SPIT.
- **Content**: Provided an introduction to VoIP systems, available security tools, and summarized proposed solutions for SPIT from previous literature.

**Quinten et al. [111]**
- **Evaluation**: Assessed techniques to prevent and reduce SPIT.
- **Categories**: Divided techniques into four categories: unsuitable, with potential, suitable, and combinations.
- **Effectiveness**: Evaluated the effectiveness of each category.

**Dantu et al. [112]**
- **Scope**: Discussed attacks and solutions in VoIP, including VoIP Spam and Phishing.
- **Review**: Reviewed previous work addressing all types of VoIP attacks.
- **Proposal**: Suggested a high-level security architecture to enhance the security and robustness of VoIP infrastructure.

**Dritsas et al. [113]**
- **Criteria**: Reviewed SPIT identification criteria for anti-SPIT mechanisms.
- **Detection Stages**: Identified different stages of SPIT detection.
- **Proposed Categories**: SIP Message criteria and SIP User Agent criteria.
- **Framework**: Proposed a two-fold evaluation framework for identifying SPIT messages.

**Marias et al. [114]**
- **Assessment**: Evaluated threats and vulnerabilities introduced by the SIP protocol.
- **Mechanisms**: Reviewed existing anti-SPIT mechanisms and classified them into three classes: Prevent, Detect, and Handle.
- **Criteria**: Proposed qualitative and quantitative criteria to assess the effectiveness of anti-SPIT countermeasures.

**Khan et al. [115]**
- **Methods**: Reviewed various existing methods for preventing spam in IP telephony.
- **Cost Analysis**: Discussed implementation costs of different techniques.
- **Recommendation**: Recommended a framework of multiple techniques, as no single technique is sufficient.

**Rosenberg et al. [116]**
- **Memo**: Open memo reviewing possible solutions for SIP spam.
- **Techniques**: Borrowed techniques from email spam prevention.
- **Identity Techniques**: Recommended identity-related techniques but noted their vulnerabilities.

### General Observations
- **Focus**: Most survey papers focus on techniques against SPIT or spam in the SIP protocol.
- **PSTN Focus**: This paper focuses on techniques for PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) telephony, where some SPIT techniques are not applicable due to protocol differences.
- **First of Its Kind**: This is the first survey specifically addressing spam calls directed to the PSTN telephony network.
- **Taxonomy**: Proposes a taxonomy to classify standalone techniques into three categories.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates standalone techniques based on three sets of assessment criteria.
- **Combination Strategies**: Outlines three strategies for combining standalone techniques.

### Conclusion
- **No Universal Solution**: No universally acceptable solution to telephone spam exists; each approach has trade-offs between usability, deployability, and robustness.
- **Usability Importance**: Usability is the most important criterion for evaluating a defense, as telephony solutions must meet high user acceptance standards.
- **Future Research**: Recommends combining techniques to improve robustness while maintaining usability.
- **Caller ID Spoofing**: Identifies caller ID spoofing as a critical issue. Making caller ID trusted and verifiable is key to combating telephone spam.
- **Call Request Header Analysis**: This technique provides the best overall usability and deployability but suffers from robustness issues due to spoofing.
- **Increasing Threat**: Telephone spam is expected to increase, defrauding consumers of billions of dollars. Effective defenses are critical.
- **Different Approaches**: Techniques effective against email spam are inappropriate for telephone spam due to technological and communication differences.
