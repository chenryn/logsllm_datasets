ABSTRACT
Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has seen a signiﬁcant resur-
gence in recent years.
ICN promises beneﬁts to users and ser-
vice providers along several dimensions (e.g., performance, secu-
rity, and mobility). These beneﬁts, however, come at a non-trivial
cost as many ICN proposals envision adding signiﬁcant complex-
ity to the network by having routers serve as content caches and
support nearest-replica routing. This paper is driven by the simple
question of whether this additional complexity is justiﬁed and if
we can achieve these beneﬁts in an incrementally deployable fash-
ion. To this end, we use trace-driven simulations to analyze the
quantitative beneﬁts attributed to ICN (e.g., lower latency and con-
gestion). Somewhat surprisingly, we ﬁnd that pervasive caching
and nearest-replica routing are not fundamentally necessary—most
of the performance beneﬁts can be achieved with simpler caching
architectures. We also discuss how the qualitative beneﬁts of ICN
(e.g., security, mobility) can be achieved without any changes to the
network. Building on these insights, we present a proof-of-concept
design of an incrementally deployable ICN architecture.

INTRODUCTION
While the idea of information- or data-centric networking has
been around for over a decade [5,21,41,46], there has been renewed
interest in the last ﬁve years, inspired in large part by the CCN
project [23]. This interest is evident on many fronts: recent papers
on this topic, several workshops and conferences, and interest from
telcos and equipment vendors (e.g., [9, 29]). Furthermore, there
are several future Internet architecture proposals that incorporate or
support ICN as a core building block (e.g., DONA [28], NDN [24],
XIA [22], 4WARD [2], SAIL [37], and COMET [13]).
This departure, both in the earlier and more recent work, from
the host-centric paradigm is motivated by the evolution of Internet
trafﬁc workloads. While the speciﬁc drivers have changed—e.g.,
Baccala’s work was motivated by web trafﬁc [5] while more re-

cent work points to the growth of video trafﬁc—the core tenet of
various ICN proposals has not changed. The insight here is that
a user’s intent is to fetch some data object rather than connect
to a speciﬁc host. By decoupling the data a user wants to access
from how the data is delivered, ICN promises several natural bene-
ﬁts. These include: lower response time via pervasive caching and
nearest-replica routing; intrinsic content integrity without external
network-level indicators (e.g., HTTPS); simpliﬁed trafﬁc engineer-
ing; and better support for mobility (e.g., [1, 18, 27, 49]).
Unfortunately, these beneﬁts come at a non-trivial cost. Many
ICN proposals envision signiﬁcant upgrades to the entire network
infrastructure requiring all end hosts and network routers to support
ICN as a ﬁrst-order primitive. This entails adding content stores to
routers and supporting routing on content names as opposed to IP
addresses. Given that some of the ICN proposals mandate whole-
sale changes to the network infrastructure, it is natural to ask if this
complexity is worthwhile. Speciﬁcally, we ask:
• Does ICN provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts?
• If so, can we achieve the same beneﬁts in a more incremen-
tally deployable fashion within the scope of today’s available
mechanisms?
In order to address these questions, we begin by breaking down
the potential beneﬁts of ICN into two categories. The ﬁrst class
of quantitative beneﬁts—lower response time and simpliﬁed traf-
ﬁc engineering—arise from a combination of a pervasive caching
infrastructure coupled with intelligent nearest-replica routing. The
second class of qualitative beneﬁts stem from the ability to name
content and verify content integrity through the naming scheme
(e.g., self-certiﬁed names or digital signatures).
Having thus bisected the potential beneﬁts, we ﬁrst focus on the
quantitative beneﬁts. Rather than commit to any speciﬁc realiza-
tion, we analyze a broad spectrum of ICN architectures along two
key dimensions: cache placement (e.g., edge caches vs. pervasive
caching) and routing (e.g., shortest path to origin servers vs. nearest
replica routing). Using trace-driven simulations, we ﬁnd that:
• On realistic request traces, the maximum performance gap be-
tween a simple edge-based caching architecture and a full-
ﬂedged ICN architecture (i.e., with pervasive caches and
nearest-replica routing) is at most 9% with respect to response
time, network congestion, and origin server load.
• Nearest-replica routing adds marginal (2%) value over simple
• Using sensitivity analysis on a range of conﬁguration parame-
ters, we ﬁnd that the optimistic best-case improvement that ICN
can provide is 17% over the simple edge-caching architecture
(on all metrics).
shortest-path routing in ICN (on all metrics).
147• Simple extensions to edge caching (e.g., doubling the cache
size or enabling local cooperation) reduces even the optimistic
best-case performance gap to less than 6% (on all metrics).
Note that we are not arguing that caching is not useful for typical
workloads. Rather, our observation is that exploiting the beneﬁts of
cacheable workloads is far easier than we imagined. The quantita-
tive beneﬁts of caching largely arise from the fact that some cache
exists; pervasive caching and nearest-replica routing add little value
for the types of heavy-tailed workloads we expect in practice. In
some sense, our work reconﬁrms (and extends) past results from
the web caching literature to the ICN context (e.g., [7]).
Motivated by these ﬁndings, we analyze whether the remaining
qualitative beneﬁts can be achieved in an incrementally deployable
fashion without router-level support. Somewhat surprisingly, we
show that many of these beneﬁts can be achieved using techniques
that are already well known in the content distribution community.
Building on these insights, we provide a reference design of an
incrementally deployable ICN architecture or idICN. idICN is an
application-layer ICN architecture that delivers most of the per-
ceived beneﬁts of ICN in a backwards-compatible fashion, without
requiring any network layer support.
In some sense, this paper is an attempt to analyze the ICN lit-
erature from an end-to-end perspective—signiﬁcant changes to the
network can be justiﬁed only if they offer substantial performance
improvements [38]. We ﬁnd that most of the beneﬁts, even those
that seem to require changes to the core network infrastructure, can
be achieved in an end-to-end fashion (i.e., implemented at the edge
of the network).
2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
In this section, we begin with a brief overview of the common
themes underlying different ICN proposals [2, 23, 24, 37]. Then,
we use real request logs to motivate the need to revisit some of the
assumptions about pervasive caching and nearest-replica routing.
2.1 ICN Principles and Beneﬁts
While ICN proposals vary in terminology, implementation, and
APIs to clients and network operators, we identify four main
themes underlying all proposals:
1. Decoupling names from locations: Network applications and
protocols are rearchitected so that communication is based on
content lookup and transfer in contrast to today’s host-centric
abstractions.
2. Pervasive caching: In the limit, every network router also acts
as a content cache. This means that in addition to traditional
forwarding responsibilities, routers also serve requests for con-
tent in their caches.
3. Nearest replica routing: Routing is based on content names
rather than hosts so that requests are routed to the nearest copy
of the content. (In the worst case, this is the origin server host-
ing the content.)
4. Binding names to intent: The content name is intrinsically
bound to the intent of the content publisher and the consumer.
This binding helps users (and routers) to check the integrity and
the provenance of the data without external indicators.
The proposals differ in speciﬁc mechanisms they use to achieve
these properties and the speciﬁc API they expose [18]. For in-
stance, some proposals prefer opaque identiﬁers [28] while others
use human-readable hierarchical naming [23]. Our goal in this pa-
per is not to focus on the speciﬁc ICN architectures; rather, we want
to analyze the beneﬁts arising from the principles underlying ICN.

Table 1: Feature-Beneﬁt Matrix for ICN: the (cid:88)shows the key fea-
tures of ICN that contribute to each perceived beneﬁt.
Beneﬁts: For completeness, we enumerate the perceived beneﬁts
of ICN that have been argued in prior work (e.g., [1, 18]):
• Lower response latency: A pervasive caching infrastructure
means that the requests do not necessarily need to traverse the
entire network toward the origin server.
• Simpliﬁed trafﬁc engineering: Caching also helps network op-
erators by automatically eliminating content hotspots, which
simpliﬁes the trafﬁc engineering logic necessary to balance net-
work load.
• Security: By elevating content as a ﬁrst-class citizen, ICN in-
trinsically binds the user’s intent to the eventual data being de-
livered without having to rely on external conﬁrmation of the
provenance or authenticity of the data.
• Mobility: Shifting from host- to content-centric routing also
makes it easier to support mobile clients, as traditional prob-
lems with handoffs, retransmissions, etc., simply go away.
• Ad hoc mode: Another beneﬁt of ICN is the ability of nodes to
communicate and share content without any infrastructure sup-
port. Imagine a user wanting to share a photo between a mobile
phone and a laptop; today we have unwieldy workarounds via
cloud-based services [47]. Further imagine that they are in an
airplane without a wireless network; in this case, they cannot
share the content because they do not have IP working.
• Others: There are other perceived beneﬁts such as DDoS re-
silience [16] and disruption tolerance that are less well ex-
plored. These appear to be speciﬁc instances or combina-
tions of the above beneﬁts. For instance, disruption tolerance
seems to be a combination of support for mobility and ad hoc
mode. Similarly, DDoS resilience stems from avoiding content
hotspots and universal caching.
Table 1 summarizes the beneﬁts and the ICN principles con-
tributing to each perceived beneﬁt. We can see that the quanti-
tative performance beneﬁts—low latency and trafﬁc engineering—
essentially arise as a result of the pervasive caching and nearest-
replica routing infrastructure envisioned by ICN solutions. Un-
surprisingly, we ﬁnd that this is also the topic that has received
the greatest attention in the ICN community.1 The second class
of qualitative beneﬁts such as mobility, security, and support for
ad hoc mode are rooted in the naming-related aspects of ICN (and
to a lesser degree from nearest-replica routing).
2.2 Motivation: Heavy-Tailed Workloads
Many measurement studies have observed heavy-tailed or Zipf
distributions (i.e., the ith popular object has a request probability
iα for some α > 0) in request popularities (e.g., [7,
proportional to 1
20]). In this section, we use request logs collected from three CDN
