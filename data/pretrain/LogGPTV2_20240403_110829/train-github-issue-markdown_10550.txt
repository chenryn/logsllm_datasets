The `THREE.SVGLoader()` is unable to correctly process the attached SVG file. The file appears to be valid, as it renders properly in Chrome and other SVG editors, suggesting that it conforms to the SVG standard. However, when loaded into three.js, the file does not cause any crashes but is rendered incorrectly, resulting in a garbled or nonsensical output.

Is this issue likely due to a bug in the `SVGLoader`?
