The THREE.SVGLoader() is unable to process the attached SVG file. Since the
file looks fine in Chrome Browser and other SVG editors, I assume the file
conforms to the SVG standard. When the file is loaded to three.js, it does not
crash anything, but it is rendered into gibberish.
Is the problem caused by a bug in the SVGLoader?
