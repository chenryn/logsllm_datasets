Testcase:
    #![feature(slice_patterns)]
    fn main() { let x: &[String] = &[]; match x { [[b..]..] => { println!("Fun{}", b.len()); } } }
Running this gives `playpen: application terminated abnormally with signal 4
(Illegal instruction)`. A quick look at the IR shows that b somehow ends up
uninitialized.
