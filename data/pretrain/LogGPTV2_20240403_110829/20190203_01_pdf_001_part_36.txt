 Table List. This is the list of currently selected tables displayed in the calling
dialog box. Each selected table has a check mark in its check box.
 Local List. This is a temporary, internal copy of the table list managed by the
wildcard selector. The wildcard selector allows you to add tables to the local list
and to remove tables from the local list. When you click the Done button of the
Wildcard Selector dialog box, the local list becomes the table list. In other words,
the local list tables appear as the selected tables of the calling dialog box.
 Unselected Tables. These are the tables eligible for, but have not been selected
for the operation with which you are using the wildcard selector. When you click
the Filter List button, the unselected tables that match the filter pattern are listed
in the Available Tables field of the Wildcard Selector dialog box. To list all
unselected tables, use the percent sign (%) for the filter pattern.
 Selected Tables. These are the tables you have selected for the operation with
which you are using the wildcard selector. That is, these are the tables comprising
the local list. To display selected tables that match a filter pattern, add the asterisk
character (*) immediately after the filter pattern. Each selected table has a check
mark in its check box.
The following describes the steps for using the wildcard selector.
Step 1: Prior to opening the Wildcard Selector dialog box, you may start selecting tables
from the list of available tables of the calling dialog box by adding a check mark to the
check box of each such table.
From the calling dialog box, click the Use Wildcard Selection button to open the
Wildcard Selector dialog box.
The tables that you have preselected are included in the local list used by the wildcard
selector to manage the addition or removal of tables.
For example, the following is the Create Publication dialog box from which the wildcard
selector can be used:

Figure 7-2 – Invoking the wildcard selector from a calling dialog box
Step 2: The Available Tables field displays the filtered list matching the pattern used in
the Filter Pattern text field.
When the Wildcard Selector dialog box is initially opened, the default filter pattern is the
percent sign (%), which returns all eligible, unselected tables.

Step 4: Select tables from the Available Tables list that you want to add to the local list
by placing a check mark in each such table’s check box. You can also click the Select All
check box to select all tables and then individually deselect certain tables by removing its
check mark.

Step 5: Click the Apply Selections to Local List button to add the selected tables to the
local list.
The following example shows that the selected tables have been removed from the
Available Tables list after the Apply Selections to Local List button was clicked since
they are no longer unselected.

Note: You can click the Cancel button at any time to terminate the wildcard selector
without applying the local list changes to the table list of the calling dialog box.
Step 6: As many times as desired, repeat steps 3 through 5 using the filter patterns
needed to add all of your desired tables to the local list.
The following example shows a second filter pattern and the returned filter list.

The deselected tables still appear in the Available Tables list since they still match the
pattern, but as unselected tables (that is, with no check mark in each such table’s check
box).
Step 7: When the local list contains all of your desired, selected tables, click the Done
button. The Wildcard Selector dialog box closes, and the local list becomes the list of
selected tables displayed by the calling dialog box.

Alternatively, if you decide that you do not wish to apply the local list, click the Cancel
button. The local list changes are discarded and the table list of the calling dialog box
remains unchanged.
Step 8: You can invoke the wildcard selector again and repeat the process to add tables
to, or remove tables from the table list by beginning with Step 1.
The following example verifies that if you were to invoke the wildcard selector a second
time, the local list includes the table list created from the prior closure of the wildcard
selector.

7.2 Creating a Schedule
A schedule establishes recurring points in time when replication is to occur.
Note (For MMR only): Be sure an initial snapshot replication has been performed from
the master definition node to every other master node in the multi-master replication
system. If a newly added master node did not undergo an initial snapshot, any subsequent
synchronization replication initiated by a schedule may fail to apply the transactions to
that master node. The initial snapshot could be taken when the master node is first added
(see Section 6.3) or by performing an on demand snapshot (see Section 6.5.1).
In a single-master replication system, once a schedule is created the subscription server
initiates replications according to the schedule until either the schedule is changed or
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 402
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
removed. In a multi-master replication system, the publication server handles this
process.
See Section 7.3 for changing or removing a schedule.
When a scheduled replication is to take place, all components of the replication system
must be running:
 Publication database server
 Subscription database server (applies only to single-master replication systems)
 Publication server
 Subscription server (applies only to single-master replication systems)
If any of the preceding components are not running at the time of a scheduled replication,
then replication does not occur at that point in time. The replication occurs at the next
scheduled replication time when all applicable replication system components are
running.
For synchronization replications with the trigger-based method, changes that have
occurred on the source tables that were not replicated due to a skipped, scheduled
replication are maintained as pending transactions in the shadow tables of the source
database.
For synchronization replications with the log-based method, changes that have been
extracted from the WAL files to in-memory structures, but have not been applied are
persisted using Java object serialization to files on the host running the publication server.
All changes since the last successful replication are applied whenever the next scheduled
replication occurs. Thus, accumulated changes are never lost due to a missed replication.
For snapshot replications, skipped, scheduled replications present no problem since a
snapshot replication replaces all of the data in the target tables with the current source
data.
Step 1 (For SMR only): Select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you
wish to create a schedule.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 403
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Figure 7-18 - Selecting a subscription on which to set a schedule
Step 1 (For MMR only): Select the Publication Database node designated as the
controller database. (The Controller database field in the Property window is set to Yes
for the controller database.)

Step 3: In the Scheduled Task Wizard dialog box, select the radio button for either
synchronization replication or snapshot replication.
Note: If the publication associated with this subscription is a snapshot-only publication,
then only Snapshot may be chosen.
Note: In a multi-master replication system, only Synchronize may be chosen.

Step 4: Select the radio button for the scheduled replication frequency, or select Cron
Expression to write your own cron expression. The frequency choices have the following
meanings:
 Continuously. Schedules replication to run continuously at an interval in seconds
that you specify. Select this option if the source tables change frequently during
the day and the target tables must be kept up-to-date throughout the course of the
day.
 Daily. Schedules replication to run once a day at the time you choose. Select this
option if the target tables need to be refreshed daily.
 Weekly. Schedules replication to run once a day at the time you choose, but only
on the specific days of the week you choose. Select this option if you need more
flexibility than a daily schedule, and the target tables do not have to be refreshed
every day.
 Monthly. Schedules replication to run one day per month on the day of the month
and time you choose, but only on the specific months you choose. Select this
option if updates to the source tables are not very frequent, and the target tables
can be out-of-date by a month or more. The Monthly option allows you to
schedule replication for as frequently as once a month or infrequently as once a
year.
 Cron Expression. Provides additional flexibility for specifying a schedule
beyond the four preceding radio button choices. See appendix Section 10.4.3 for
directions on writing a cron expression.

7.3 Managing a Schedule
Once a schedule has been created, xDB Replication Server performs replications
according to the schedule until the schedule is updated or removed.
The updating or removal of a schedule has no effect on a replication that has already been
started. If a replication is in progress when the schedule is updated or removed, the in
progress replication continues until completion.
7.3.1 Updating a Schedule
The following steps illustrate how to change an existing schedule.
Step 1 (For SMR only): Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of
the subscription you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB
Replication Console you are using. See Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting and
registering a subscription server.
Step 1 (For MMR only): Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of
the controller database you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB
Replication Console you are using. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and
registering a publication server.
Step 2 (For SMR only): Select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you
wish to update the schedule.

7.3.2 Removing a Schedule
If you no longer wish replication to take place automatically, you must remove the
schedule. You can always re-add a schedule or perform on demand replication.
Step 1 (For SMR only): Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of
the subscription you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB
Replication Console you are using. See Section 5.3.1 for directions on starting and
registering a subscription server.
Step 1 (For MMR only): Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of
the controller database you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB
Replication Console you are using. See Section 5.2.1 for directions on starting and
