Relaxation of the wavelength assignment ILP. The above
wavelength assignment problem has been proven to be NP-hard [11,
12]. To solve this problem in practical network scale for polynomial
time, we relax the 0-1 binary variable 𝜉𝑒,𝑘
𝜙,𝑤 to be a floating-point
value between 0 and 1 and transform the wavelength assignment
problem into a LP. Hence, the restored capacity 𝜆𝑒 for link 𝑒 also
becomes a floating-point number.
Handling non-fractional 𝜆𝑒. In some cases, the relaxed wave-
length assignment LP will return integer numbers for 𝜆𝑒 ∈ Z+. They
do not need rounding processing (desired case in normal rounding
problems). However, in our problem setting, where we are gener-
ating a set of different restoration candidates, this non-fractional
output will result in 0 probability to apply either rounding up or
down. Note that in standard randomized rounding techniques, the
non-fractional results mean no rounding operation is needed. But
in our problem setting, this limits the exploration space of candi-
date restoration options. To address the non-fractional condition,
in our evaluations, when we encounter this situation, we set the
probability of rounding up and down as 0.3, and the probability of
not rounding as 0.4.
A.3 Proof of Theorem 3.1
Following the discussion in §3.3, we aim to provide a probabilistic
guarantee of LotteryTickets’ optimality with randomized round-
ing. Our proof is based on an the assumption that if the optimal
LotteryTicket appears in the set of LotteryTickets as input to Ar-
row (𝑧𝑜𝑝𝑡 ∈ 𝑍), Arrow’s TE will find the optimal allocation. This
assumption is true for Arrow’s binary TE formulation (shown in
Table 9).
To prove Theorem 3.1, we consider the case where there exists a
restoration candidate 𝑧𝑜𝑝𝑡 that maximizes Arrow’s TE objective.
Arrow’s randomized rounding technique (Algorithm 1) returns
a set 𝑍 of candidate restoration options (LotteryTickets). There-
fore, the probability of 𝑧𝑜𝑝𝑡 ∈ 𝑍 equals the probability of Arrow
finding the optimal allocation. We denote this probability as 𝜌𝑞
in Equation (12). We denote 𝜅 as the probability of finding 𝑧𝑜𝑝𝑡
with randomized rounding. Hence, for each LotteryTicket, 1 − 𝜅
denotes the probability that this LotteryTicket is not optimal and
(1 − 𝜅)|𝑍 𝑞 | denotes the probability that all |𝑍𝑞| LotteryTickets are
not optimal. Therefore, the probability of finding 𝑧𝑜𝑝𝑡 (at least one
optimal LotteryTicket) is 1 − (1 − 𝜅)|𝑍 𝑞 |.
To find 𝜅, we need to derive the probability of finding the best
LotteryTicket using our randomized rounding algorithm (Algo-
rithm 1). We apply probabilistic randomized rounding in two steps:
1) rounding stride decision (line 6); 2) rounding up/down decision
(line 7). With 𝛿 as the maximum rounding stride, the probability that
our chosen stride will be optimal is 1/𝛿. Therefore, for one failed
IP link, the probability of obtaining the best LotteryTicket from
the initial LP floating point solution is 1/𝛿 × Pr{𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑢𝑝/𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛}.
Since each failure scenario 𝑞 may affect multiple IP links, every
LotteryTicket may contain the restoration value of several IP links.
Therefore, the probability 𝜅 of finding the optimal LotteryTicket
is determined by multiplying the probabilities of all failed IP links.
Hence, we derive Equation (13).
A.4 Optimal IP/Optical Formulation for
Restoration-Aware TE
We present the difference between conventional TE and restoration-
aware TE in Fig. 18. As we discussed in §3, the LotteryTicket design
enables Arrow to balance computation complexity and solution
optimality: 1) TE without optical restoration information (conven-
tional TE that only operate on the IP layer, e.g., FFC, TeaVaR, etc,
shown in Fig. 18(a)), and 2) TE with full optical restoration infor-
mation (Table 7, shown in Fig. 18(b) and Fig. 18(c)). We present
the optimal IP/optical version of Arrow formulation in Table 7. In
Fig. 18(d), we depict the design of Arrow’s approach to avoid the
excessive complexity of the joint IP/optical formulation based on
abstracting optical layer with LotteryTickets.

IP/optical TE is optimal.
Ideally, an IP/optical cross-layer TE
takes a set of failure scenarios as well as full optical-layer informa-
tion for optical restoration into account while optimizing traffic al-
locations on tunnels to maximize overall network throughput. This
IP/optical cross-layer TE is optimal in terms of network throughput,
because IP-layer flow allocation is jointly optimized with optical-
layer wavelength restoration.
Optimal IP/optical TE is computationally intractable. As we
shown in Fig. 18(b), the cross-layer TE problem takes a set of failure
scenarios as input, and for each failure scenario it also contains
constraints on the routing (A1) and wavelength assignment (B1)
problems on the optical layer following all the optical-layer con-
straints (e.g., wavelength continuity). This is a RWA problem, which
has been proven to be NP-Complete [88]. Moreover, as shown in
Fig. 18(c), another way to formulate the cross-layer TE is to convert
flow conservation constraints of the wavelength routing problem
into a set of pre-calculated surrogate restoration fiber paths (A2)
and feed them into the optimization for wavelength assignment
(B1). This operation reduces the problem size, but the selection of
which surrogate restoration fiber path to use and which wavelength
to restore is still an integer problem.
Dynamic restorable tunnels. Unlike the Arrow formulation in
Table 2 and Table 3, the state that whether a tunnel is restorable
or not is not an input to the optimization, but being dynamically
decided internally during the optimization. This is because which
IP link can be restored on the optical layer is jointly decided with
TE flow allocation, not as input (e.g., LotteryTickets). Therefore,
in the joint IP/optical formulation, we do not have a restorable
as input. Instead, we take all failed tunnels 𝑇𝑓 − 𝑇 𝑞
tunnels set 𝑌 𝑧,𝑞
𝑓
of flow 𝑓 as candidates to be potentially restored and jointly make
the decision with the optical-layer RWA.
Size of the optimal formulation. The optimal formulation is
computational intractable, and cannot yield solutions within rea-
sonable amount of time. Therefore, we list the size of the optimiza-
tion formulation in Table 8. As we can find in Table 8, for an ILP
with such problem size, it is not feasible to obtain an optimal solu-
tion even in several days with state-of-the-art optimization solvers,
e.g., Gurobi [66]. Hence, the cross-layer optimal formulation is
computationally intractable for TE.
𝑓
Constraints. Constraints (18-20) are identical as Constraints (1-3)
in Table 2 and Constraints (7-9) in Table 3. Constraint (21) considers
all failed tunnels as potential dynamic restorable tunnels and ensure
that the total allocated bandwidth for flow 𝑓 should be no larger
than sum bandwidth of its residual tunnels and dynamic restorable
tunnels. Constraint (22) ensures the total bandwidth capacity of
restorable tunnels does not exceed the restorable bandwidth of the
failed link 𝑒 under failure scenario 𝑞. Constraints (23-26) are similar
as Constraints (14-17) and ensure RWA constraints for restoring
wavelengths of each failed IP link under failure scenario 𝑞. Con-
straint (27) connects the total number of restorable wavelength
𝑒 of restorable IP
links 𝑒 under failure scenario 𝑞 by multiplying each wavelength
with its modulation format.
A.5 Binary ILP Formulation for Arrow’s TE
𝑒,𝑞 of link 𝑒 with the bandwidth capacity 𝑟𝑞
𝑘 𝜆𝑘
with LotteryTickets
Arrow’s ticket selection process can be formulated as a binary-
integer linear problem due to ticket selection (represented by a
binary variable 𝑥𝑧,𝑞), as shown in Table 9. The advantage of this
binary formulation is that it can confirm the assumption in Proof 3.1
(if the optimal LotteryTicket appears in the set of LotteryTickets as
input to Arrow (𝑧∗ ∈ 𝑍), Arrow’s TE finds the optimal allocation),
however, at the cost of computational complexity.
Constraints. Constraints (28-30) are identical to Constraints (1-3)
in Table 2, Constraints (7-9) in Table 3 and Constraints (18-20) in
Table 7. Constraint (31-32) are augmented from Constraints (4-5)
with the binary selection of LotteryTicket. Constraint (33) ensures
only one LotteryTicket can be selected for each failure scenario 𝑞.
A.6 ROADM Reconfigurations
Parallel ROADM configurations. In practice, the surrogate restora-
tion fiber path includes multiple ROADMs, and all of them need
to be configured for data/noise replacement. In Arrow, we avoid
serially configuring each of these ROADMs. Instead, we group
all ROADMs into two categories: add/drop ROADMs representing
source/destination sites and intermediate ROADMs representing
ROADMs that act as optical switches to steer light to a designated
direction. Arrow reconfigures all ROADMs in each group in par-
allel: it first reconfigures all add/drop ROADMs as well as their
