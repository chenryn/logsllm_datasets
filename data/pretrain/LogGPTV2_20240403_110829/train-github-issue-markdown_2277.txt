I found this #1655 but it was closed without a real answer and it links to a
spec doc that people ask about it in the comments but I do not see anyone
answering why it's omitted in the spec.
    const first = Symbol();
    const second = Symbol();
    class Foo {
      // This works
      [first]() {}
      // This does not
      [second] = {};
    }
    repl: Unexpected token (6:11)
      4 | class Foo {
      5 |   [first]() {}
    > 6 |   [second] = {};
        |            ^
      7 | }
