User: I have a Cherokee installation that I'm using to serve a few web applications - one blog/calendar/etc. and two CPU-intensive web applications (1 stable version and 1 development version). All of them are Django or Pylons webservices served with CherryPy.  I'm using the reverse-proxy handler in Cherokee to handle the mappings.
Occasionally I have to take the development version down to make changes.  Is there a way to set up Cherokee so that it will automatically serve (or redirect to) another page (e.g. indicating an under-construction status) when the reverse-proxy target is unfindable or unresponsive?
I'd prefer an automated solution in Cherokee but if someone knows a simple point-and-click method I'll take that too.
Assistant: You could set a custom 504 error page.
