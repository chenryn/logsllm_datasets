synthesized netlist as well. Major FPGA vendors like Synplify and
Vivado support this feature. Also, this technique never recovers the
highi-level RTL code which is of main interest for IP piracy.
There have been numerous attacks on various protocols and
standards that use CBC mode for encryption. In [35], Vaudenay
showed that padding errors in CBC mode can be used as an oracle
to get the decrypted text without knowing the key. Canvel et al.
extended this idea in [11] by exploiting timing difference between
errors due to bad MAC and those due to improper padding, to
intercept the password of an email client that connects to an IMAP
server over SSL/TLS.
While Vaudenay exploited the RC5-CBC-PAD algorithm [7],
Paterson and Yau demonstrated efficient attacks on the ISO CBC
Mode Encryption standard to recover plaintext [29]. These attacks
required IVs to be public. The same group of researchers came
up with new padding-oracle attacks against the revamped ISO
CBC Mode Encryption standard that recommended private and
random IVs instead of public IVs [37]. Joux et al. in [15] gave attacks
on CBC mode of encryption by adversaries that can adaptively
choose chunks (one or more blocks) of plaintext bytes to find the
original message. They termed these adversaries as block-wise-
adaptive adversaries. In [9], Black et al. studied Vaudenay’s attack
with different padding schemes - XY-pad, OZ-pad, AByte-pad, to
name a few. They found that padding methods that have no invalid
paddings are immune against padding-oracle attacks, which was
corroborated by Paterson and Watson in their provable security
analysis of CBC mode against padding-oracle attacks [28]. One
such padding scheme is AByte-pad. In [19], Klíma et al. used ASN.1
encoding errors in PKCS#7 with AByte padding as an oracle to
invert the ciphertext. Most of these attacks can be thwarted by
enforcing integrity checks on the ciphertext.
Prior to Vaudenay’s attack on CBC mode, Bleichenbacher pre-
sented an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack that exploits padding
errors in PKCS#1 v1.5 [10]. This attack was extended by Klíma et
al. in [18]. They used errors due to the version number check in
PKCS#1 as a side-channel. A plaintext-aware encryption scheme,
RSAES-OAEP was proposed to make it immune against such cho-
sen ciphertext attacks. But, Manger in [20] exploited side channels
in implementations of RSAES-OAEP as specified in PKCS#1 v2.0, to
recover the plaintext message. This attack is based on the fact that

do not apply the ABAO optimization, then the average accuracy
increases to 98%, while execution time increases by 16x. For ex-
ample, the accuracy for FF, SQRT, FFT, AES, and RS increases to
100%, 95.9%, 99.5%, 98%, and 97.2%, respectively without the ABAO
optimization.
Comparison between the padding-oracle attack and the syntax-
oracle attack. From Figure 9, it is evident that with the ABAO
optimization, the POA is around 13 times (mean 12.6 with a stan-
dard deviation of 1.3) slower than the SOA. This is because in the
former attack, for j < 16, the jth plaintext character can be guessed
only when the (j + 1)th character has already been found. There is
no such restriction on the latter attack. We find all instances of the
guessed character in the entire ciphertext in a single guess.
Though the SOA is fast, it loses out (some) on accuracy with
the ABAO optimization. Its accuracy has an average of 85.3% with
standard deviation of 4.4%, whereas the POA is always 100% ac-
curate. But, without the ABAO optimization, the accuracy of the
syntax-oracle attack shoots to nearly 98%. We reiterate that the POA
works only with AES-CBC and padding schemes which distinguish
between a valid and invalid padding. On the other hand, the SOA
has no such restrictions.
7 RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, Myrian and Chow [23] provide the
only work that presents any attack on the IEEE P1735 standard.
Session G3:  Crypto StandardsCCS’17, October 30-November 3, 2017, Dallas, TX, USA1544the adversary can distinguish between errors during decoding and
those due to incorrect integer to octet conversion; this is possible
as the standard is vague on error conditions, such as unsupported
MGF, handling of timing difference between the two errors, etc.
Apart from the above attacks, there has been a plethora of side
channel attacks in the last 15 years - padding error attacks on
RSA [14, 17, 22], timing attacks on AES-CBC implementations (MAC-
encode-encrypt) in SSL/TLS [4], timing attacks on SSH [5, 6], and
other side-channel attacks [9, 21, 24, 33, 39].
8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The P1735 IP encryption standard is widely used in the EDA com-
munity to protect confidentiality of high-value IPs. It also enforces
fine-grained access control via rights management and licensing
mechanisms. We have presented confidentiality and integrity at-
tacks on the P1735 standard as implemented by the widely used
Synplify Premier tool, a Synopsys EDA tool that provides an ad-
vanced FPGA design and debug environment. While the confiden-
tiality attacks can reveal the entire plaintext IP, the integrity attack
enables an attacker to insert hardware Trojans into the encrypted
IP. This not only destroys any protection that the standard was
supposed to provide, but also increases the risk premium of the IP.
We also proposed various optimizations of the basic confidentiality
attacks that reduce the complexity from O (N 2) to O (N ).
The design flaws in P1735 are troubling considering the fact
that it is susceptible to the classical POA that was reported in 2002,
and it is disappointing that an international organization like the
IEEE would mandate a brittle encryption mode (CBC) without
any authentication, when there has been more than a decade of
published research on AEAD schemes.
The standard also recommends PKCS#1 v1.5 as a padding scheme
for RSA. As discussed in the related work section, there are many
side-channel attacks on this padding scheme. In future work, we
plan to attack the Key Block of the encrypted IP, which holds the
encryption of the symmetric key used to create the Data Block,
using RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption scheme. We will also extend
our cryptanalysis to other EDA tools (e.g. Xilinx), and evaluate
license-proxy implementations complying with the P1735 standard
as they become available.

• The standard is vague in its specification of the license response
protocol. There are different security sensitive parameters like
the length field, the command byte, the license id, etc, that are
exchanged between the proxy server and the tool in each of
their messages. Hence, it is crucial to clearly state how each of
these parameters is checked/handled by the tool. However, the
standard (again) leaves these security sensitive decisions at the
discretion of the tool vendors.

A CRITIQUE OF THE P1735 STANDARD
The P1735 standard recommends a lot of troubling cryptographic
design choices that make the encrypted IP vulnerable to many
attacks. Some of these attacks are described in this paper, but there
could be more. The standard is also vague and erroneous in some
of its security sensitive specifications and claims. In this section,
we enlist these shortcomings of the standard.
• The standard states, “the protected IP has 100% fidelity to the
original IP representation”. This is not true as one could drop/add
random ciphertext blocks owing to missing authentication checks
on the Data Block.
• It makes no recommendations for AES-CBC padding, and leaves
this important security decision to the tool vendors.
• In absence of a padding scheme, and any authentication whatso-
ever, AES decryption never fails. However, the resulting plaintext
may get corrupt. The standard, on the contrary, has some mech-
anism due to which decryption could fail. This security sensitive
design decision is again left at the discretion of the tool vendors.
• The standard mentions encrypting each IP with a one-time ses-
sion key [13, Section 1], but it does not define a session explicitly.
• It recommends PKCS#1 V1.5 padding scheme for RSA. This
scheme has been exploited as a side-channel to recover the under-
lying plaintext which is the session key in the digital envelope.
• In the licensing mechanism, the length of the encrypted messages
is sent in clear text in both public-key and secret-key encryption.
