ABSTRACT
Accurate reporting and analysis of network failures has historically
required instrumentation (e.g., dedicated tracing of routing proto-
col state) that is rarely available in practice. In previous work, our
group has proposed that a combination of common data sources
could be substituted instead.
In particular, by opportunistically
stitching together data from router conﬁguration logs and syslog
messages, we demonstrated that a granular picture of network fail-
ures could be resolved and veriﬁed with human trouble tickets. In
this paper, we more fully evaluate the ﬁdelity of this approach,
by comparing with high-quality “ground truth” data derived from
an analysis of contemporaneous IS-IS routing protocol messages.
We identify areas of agreement and disparity between these data
sources, as well as potential ways to correct disparities when pos-
sible.

INTRODUCTION
Reliability and availability are among the most important quali-
ties of a network and must be ensured both through careful design
(e.g., deploying physically redundant devices and logically toler-
ant protocols to mask failures) and diligent operational practices
(e.g., responding to failures that cannot be masked). To inform
such efforts, there is broad interest in tracking network failures,
their durations and their causes. Unfortunately, the Internet archi-
tecture does not include comprehensive failure measurement as a
ﬁrst-class capability and thus failure analysis inevitably involves
pressing a range of other tools into this service: syslog, routing
protocol monitoring, SNMP, human trouble tickets, active probes
and so on. However, it is not well understood how these different

techniques differ in their ability to capture and characterize avail-
ability failures.
In previous work we developed a methodology to analyze net-
work failures based upon readily available router log messages (i.e.,
syslog) and used it to analyze over ﬁve years of failure events in
the CENIC regional network [17]. Our original study used oper-
ator e-mails and active probing as sources of ground truth to val-
idate the results of our method. However, both data sources pro-
vide only sparse coverage of the failures identiﬁed in our study
and their own ﬁdelity is known to be imperfect as well (e.g., op-
erators do not record short-lived failures in trouble tickets). The
“gold standard” for identifying downtime is via high-ﬁdelity logs
of link-state router messages. Conﬁguring and deploying an IGP
listener to record such logs is neither technologically difﬁcult nor
novel [9]. However, an active listener carries the risk of disrupting
network operations in the event of a catastrophic malfunction or
compromise. As a result such datasets are rarely available in oper-
ational networks and were not available when we ﬁrst analyzed the
CENIC network. Thus, in many cases, including our own previous
work, network analysis is conducted using syslog data [4, 10, 14,
15, 21]. Worryingly, it remains unknown what sacriﬁces a syslog-
based approach makes in terms of accuracy when compared to the
ground truth revealed via routing protocol messages.
In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst analysis of this trade-off by
comparing the results of analyzing contemporaneous network-wide
router syslog data and real-time ISIS routing protocol updates over
a 13-month period in the CENIC network. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant dis-
parities between the failure traces computed from the syslog and
IS-IS data sources: the former does not capture 20% of the failures
identiﬁed by the latter. Nevertheless, the statistical distribution of
the failure traces is consistent for some metrics (e.g., failures per
link and link downtime) but clearly distinct for others (e.g., failure
duration). At a qualitative level, the importance of these differences
depends greatly upon the use of the data: if an operator is merely
attempting to identify aggregate link availability, syslog-based ap-
proaches seem adequate. If, on the other hand, the analysis is being
conducted in order to determine more involved metrics, like iden-
tifying periods of complete isolation for portions of the network,
higher ﬁdelity data sources may be required.
In general, we ﬁnd that syslog-based analyses provide reasonable
approximations of those based upon routing protocol data, but with
three important caveats:
1. Syslog frequently fails to accurately reﬂect link state during
periods of ﬂapping (i.e., rapid state transitions).
2. Long-lasting failures (e.g., over 24 hours) should be manu-
ally veriﬁed as they are frequently false positives due to lost
syslog messages.
3. Attempting to model link state over time through syslog oc-
casionally results in nonsensical state changes (e.g., syslog
reports that a currently operational link just came up). We
ﬁnd the best approach is to assume that the offending state
change message is a spurious retransmission and leave the
link state unmodiﬁed.
2. RELATED WORK
A large number of efforts have attempted to quantify the amount,
types, and causes of failure in wide-area networks. The vast major-
ity of these studies follow a tomographic approach, where measure-
ments collected at the edges of networks are used to infer the causes
of disruptions in end-to-end trafﬁc ﬂow [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11, 18, 22].
It is well known, however, that such approaches are not as accurate
as measurement from within the network itself [5].
Direct measurements are much more complicated and costly
to obtain, resulting in a dearth of such studies. One general ap-
proach taps into the interior gateway protocol (IGP) messages em-
ployed by the network under consideration to monitor how the rout-
ing protocol behaves, as route updates typically indicate connec-
tivity changes. Two previous studies monitored OSPF networks:
Shaikh et al. [16] studied OSPF behavior in a large enterprise net-
work, and Watson, Jahanian and Labovitz [19] studied a network of
ﬁfty routers, including internal and customer links, over the course
of one year. Markopoulou et al. [12], on the other hand, studied six
months of IS-IS routing protocol messages collected from hundreds
of nodes in the Sprint backbone. All of these studies, while valu-
able in providing insight into the behavior of real networks, use
methodologies and hardware that is often not practical for many
network operators.
In contrast, in our own previous work, we considered whether
lower-quality data sources, namely syslog and operator emails,
could be used instead [17]. Others have used similar approaches:
Gill et al. used syslog to analyze failures in a data center net-
work [4]; Labovitz et al. combine SNMP queries with opera-
tional logs to analyze failures in the backbone of a regional ser-
vice provider [7], and Xu et al. parse syslog records to identify
anomalies in data center operations [20]. While each of these ef-
forts provided some form of validation against various forms of
“ground truth,” none directly compare their results to a contempo-
raneous study based upon IGP data. To the best of our knowledge,
our study represents the ﬁrst head-to-head comparison of the re-
sults of high-ﬁdelity IS-IS monitoring to “lower quality” methods
that employ only syslog or data sources.
3. BACKGROUND
Network failures can be categorized by many attributes including
duration, cause, impact, and frequency. While no attribute is most
important, some attributes are more relevant for particular purposes
than others: a network engineer trying to improve reliability is
likely to be concerned with cause and impact while a researcher
developing a new routing protocol is likely to more interested in
frequency and duration.
On the other hand, different actors have different resources avail-
able to them, and some may not be able to obtain the same quality
of information with which to conduct their analyses. Ideally, anal-
yses conducted with the most easily available data would be sufﬁ-
ciently accurate to be suitable for all purposes. Clearly such data
sources are unlikely to provide exact failure-for-failure account-
ing; we seek to understand which—if any—statistical properties
are similar, and to what degree.

Before delving into the details of our ﬁndings, this section pro-
vides basic information about CENIC, the network that forms the
basis of our study, as well as the various data sources and methods
used in our analysis.
3.1 CENIC
CENIC is a regional ISP in California that provides network
connectivity to over 120 non-proﬁt educational institutions. The
CENIC network consists of 60 backbone routers connected by 10
GBit/s links as well as 175 routers on customer premises. We re-
fer to the former as Core routers and the latter as CPE (customer
premises equipment) routers. The network uses the IS-IS routing
protocol on the Core and CPE devices, organized as a single IS-IS
network, described next. (A more detailed description of CENIC’s
topology and structure is available elsewhere [17].)
3.2
IS-IS
The routing state of a network is commonly regarded as ground
truth because if the routing protocol (IS-IS in the case of CENIC)
declares a link is down, then for all practical intents and purposes it
is down since no trafﬁc will be directed to it. Similarly, if IS-IS de-
clares a link to be up, then the link is at least capable of hearing and
answering IS-IS “hello” packets, which is in most cases evidence
enough that a link is functioning.
Each LSP advertisement
We capture CENIC routing state using a server running a lightly-
modiﬁed version of Richard Mortier’s Python Routing Toolkit [13]
to act as a router participating in the IS-IS network. Since IS-IS
is a link-state routing protocol each router periodically ﬂoods its
current adjacencies to the rest of the network in a link state packet
(LSP). Adjacencies correspond to physical links between routers; it
is possible for neighboring routers to have more than one adjacency.
series of
type/length/value (TLV) ﬁelds.
Table 1 lists the TLV ﬁelds
we use. The ﬁrst ﬁeld, LSP ID, is the unique OSI identiﬁer for
each router. The second ﬁeld, Host Name, is a human readable
hostname. The Extended IS Reachability ﬁeld contains
a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the OSI identiﬁer for a device
directly connected to the router as well as the link weight (routing
metric); larger weights are less preferred paths. These weights are
conﬁgured by operators.
encoded as
In addition to router adjacencies, LSPs also contain information
about which IP networks are directly reachable from the router.
IP Reachability is derived from interfaces that are conﬁg-
ured with IP addresses and from statically conﬁgured information.
The set of IP ranges known to IS-IS does not include customer ad-

dresses, which are handled by BGP. Therefore, almost all of the
subnets advertised are those of the point-to-point links that make
up the CENIC backbone and links to CPE devices.
For every LSP we receive we ﬁrst extract the sender’s OSI ID.
If this is the ﬁrst LSP from the sender we record its host name in
our mapping of OSI IDs to hostnames and record its IS-IS neigh-
bors and IP reachability. Subsequently, for each new LSP received
from the node, we compare the advertised IS-IS adjacencies and
IP reachability to adjacencies and IP reachability advertised previ-
ously. If any new adjacencies or IP space has been formed or lost
we attempt to determine, with the help of the mined conﬁguration
ﬁles, to which link(s) this adjacency or IP space corresponds.
3.3 Syslog
Network operators often use syslog [8] to obtain diagnostic in-
formation. Its popularity is likely do to its ability to expose a wealth
of diagnostic in human-readable text strings and ease of conﬁgura-
tion. Syslog messages are nothing more than plain text strings that
are transmitted via UDP to a central logging server. The convention
followed by the Cisco routers in our study ensures that each syslog
message has a similar format: timestamp, name of router and pro-
cess generating the message, and speciﬁc diagnostic message.
Every router in the CENIC network is conﬁgured to send syslog
messages to a central logging facility. We were provided access to
the subset of these messages that pertain to the link, link protocol,
and IS-IS routing protocol of the router.
(Table 1 lists statistics
about the syslog data.) Because syslog messages are transmitted
via UDP and the syslog process runs with low priority, message
generation and delivery is far from certain.
3.4 Matching
Our goal is to determine the relative accuracy of historical rout-
ing state, i.e., periods of link up and downtime, extracted from sys-
log messages. In particular, we seek to compare the failures ex-
tracted from syslog messages to those extracted from IS-IS LSPs.
Making such a comparison requires the ability to extract failures
from both data sources, ﬁnd a common naming convention, and
have a precise deﬁnition of when two failures are a match.
Determining a link’s state via syslog is straightforward. A link
transitions states whenever a syslog packet says such a transition
has occurred. However, we do observe cases where we receive two
down state transitions without an intervening up transition and vice
versa. We consider the state of the link between two down/up state
transitions to be ambiguous. (In contrast, in our previous work we
removed such events from the data set [17].)
Determining a link’s state according to IS-IS is similar. A link
is in the “up” state as long as the adjacency or IP space is listed in
the appropriate LSP packets, e.g. “down” transitions occur when a
previously listed adjacency or IP space is no longer advertised and
“up” transition occurs when it is re-advertised.
