Piping a numpy array as binary data to another process works in Python2, but
in Python3 the following snippet results in "OSError: first argument must be a
string or open file". I tested with Python 3.4.0.
    import subprocess, numpy
    wc = subprocess.Popen(["wc"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
    numpy.eye(5).tofile(wc.stdin)
