Question: "As a security tester, you are trying to determine if a web application is revealing information about user existence. You send these two separate requests to the server:

1. A valid username with the wrong password.
2. An invalid username with the wrong password.

For the first request, the server responds with 'The password is not correct,' while for the second request, it responds with 'User not recognized.' How does this server behavior aid in user enumeration?"
 "A": "It indicates that the server is properly configured to prevent user enumeration by providing generic error messages."
 "B": "It demonstrates that the server is vulnerable to user enumeration as it confirms the existence of a user when a valid username is provided."
 "C": "It suggests that the server is vulnerable because it gives a more detailed error message for invalid usernames."
 "D": "It reveals that the server only has a single error message for any type of authentication failure, thus preventing user enumeration."
Answer: B
