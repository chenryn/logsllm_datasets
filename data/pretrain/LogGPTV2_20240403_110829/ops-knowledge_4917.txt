User: Hello I'm trying to run twisted along with python but python cannot find twisted. 
I did run $pip install twisted successfully but it is still not available.
ImportError: No module named twisted.internet.protocol
It seems that most people have $which python  at /usr/local/bin/python 
but I get /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python 
May this be the issue? If so, how can I change the PATH env?
Assistant: I too was getting a ImportError: No module named xxxeven though I did a pip install xxx and pip2 install xxx.
pip2.7 install xxx worked for me. This installed it in the python 2.7 directory.
