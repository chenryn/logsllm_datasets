ABSTRACT
We measure the usage of cipher suites in protected Wi-Fi networks,
and do this for several distinct geographic areas. Surprisingly, we
found that 44.81% of protected networks still support the old WPA-
TKIP cipher. Motivated by this, we systematically analyze the secu-
rity of several implementations of WPA-TKIP, and present novel
side-channel attacks against them. The presented attacks bypass
existing countermeasures and recover the Michael message authen-
tication key in 1 to 4 minutes. Using this key, an adversary can then
decrypt and inject network traffic. In contrast, previous attacks
needed 7 to 8 minutes. These results stress the urgent need to stop
using WPA-TKIP.

1 INTRODUCTION
Wireless networks have significantly evolved over the recent years
due to increased demands and requirements of new applications,
and so too have their security protocols. For instance, recently the
Wi-Fi Alliance released Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) [38], and
created a certification for Opportunistic Wireless Encryption [14].
WPA3 is expected to replace the current WPA2 security protocol
with better security guarantees (e.g., longer keys), and offers an
optional updated protocol to easily configure Wi-Fi on the new
generation of smart things and systems without traditional input
devices. Previous iterations of wireless security protocols, such as
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and version one of WPA, have
shown to be vulnerable to numerous attacks. For example, the first
attack on WEP was demonstrated in 2001 [11], causing WEP to

be officially deprecated by the IEEE in 2004 [3]. Several attacks on
the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), an interim solution
introduced following the WEP attacks, have also been demonstrated,
with the first vulnerability already being discovered in 2009 [29].
Given these well-known vulnerabilities, and the potential im-
plications of an attack, one would assume that support for such
legacy protocols are limited, and in majority of the cases no longer
deployed in modern Wi-Fi networks. However, our wardriving
efforts in several geographic areas revealed that, although WEP
deployments have significantly reduced over the years, nearly half
of all encrypted Wi-Fi networks still support and use WPA-TKIP.
Specifically, our experiments across three different countries show
that TKIP is still supported by 44.81 percent of encrypted networks.
It is important to note that TKIP was even partly deprecated by the
Wi-Fi Alliance in 2015 [37]. Supporting insecure legacy protocols
increases the attack surface, and it is our belief that through this
paper we will help accelerate the process of completely deprecating
support for WPA-TKIP. Since its introduction, several flaws have
been identified in WPA-TKIP [29, 32]. In 2009, Tews and Beck pub-
lished the first practical attacks against WPA-TKIP [29]. Several
improvements have been made to the original attack making it
more efficient and practical [22, 30, 32]. Numerous countermea-
sures were introduced to limit the effect of potential attacks. For
example, Tews and Beck propose using a short rekeying interval,
and disabling the transmission of Michael MIC failure reports [29].
In this paper, we introduce novel side-channel attacks that abuse
power management features, fragmentation of data frames, and the
hardware decryption features of a wireless network card. Unlike
previously known attacks, the presented attacks do not rely on
specific features such as the Michael MIC failure reports and are
therefore unaffected by existing countermeasures. Furthermore,
our attacks enable an adversary to attack the Access Point (AP),
instead of only the client, and are significantly faster to execute.
As a result, an adversary can now also decrypt data sent by the
AP, and can inject frames towards any client. Given that TKIP is
still supported by a large number of wireless networks, where even
modern clients must use it to decrypt group-addressed frames, our
research has a significant impact of the users of these networks.
We make the following contributions in this paper. First, we show
through wardriving experiments that WPA-TKIP is still widely de-
ployed in a large percentage of today’s protected wireless networks.
We then thoroughly investigate the security of devices that deploy
TKIP, by inspecting all the components of their Wi-Fi stack for
novel attacks. Prior works focused largely on specific features of
the TKIP protocol that generated MIC failures. In contrast, in this
paper we investigate implementations while considering the Wi-Fi
stack in its entirety, and thereby discover new side-channel vul-
nerabilities. Particularly, we expose vulnerabilities in the power
management and fragmentation mechanism, leverage hardware
decryption modules, and present two fatal vulnerabilities due to

findings on major operating systems such as Linux and OpenBSD.
Furthermore, we investigated specific implementations of Medi-
atek and Broadcom devices and found them to be vulnerable to our
side-channel attacks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 3,
we motivate our research and provide recent numbers on encryp-
tion protocols used in today’s Wi-Fi networks. In Section 4 and 5,
we present and empirically evaluate our novel side-channel attacks.
In Section 6, we discuss the impact of, and countermeasures against,
the newly discovered attacks. Finally, we discuss related work in
Section 7, and provide concluding remarks in Section 8.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section we describe relevant parts of the IEEE 802.11i stan-
dard [3], focus on the specification of TKIP, and explain the original
Beck and Tews attack against TKIP [29].
2.1 History
The 802.11 standard focuses on Wireless LANs (WLANs), and is a
collection of specifications defining aspects of wireless communica-
tion on the physical and data-link layer, and security protocols. The
original version of the IEEE 802.11 standard met the privacy and
security requirements with a basic security algorithm named Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) that intends to provide confidentiality
comparable to that of a traditional network. WEP is considered to
be completely broken due to many design flaws [9, 29, 32], causing
significant deficiencies in both the encryption and the authentica-
tion mechanisms [15]. WEP can therefore not be used anymore for
secure data communication.
The IEEE 802.11 Task Group I addressed the security flaws in the
base standard, and published a draft of the IEEE 802.11i amendment
in 2003 [4]. It defined security enhancements that can be imple-
mented with existing hardware and was named Wi-Fi Protected Ac-
cess (WPA) by the Wi-Fi Alliance. WPA is an intermediate solution
that replaces WEP with the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP).
It is an intermediate solution because TKIP compromises on strong
security, to assure it can still be used on (old) existing hardware.
Research has shown that TKIP fails in providing sufficient security
[29, 32], and a more secure alternative is required.
In July 2004, the IEEE 802.11 Task Group I finalized the IEEE
802.11i amendment [3]. The standard was given the name Wi-Fi
Protected Access II (WPA2) by the Wi-Fi Alliance, and required
mandatory support for a more robust encryption algorithm named
the CTR mode with CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP). CCMP is based
upon the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCM) of the Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. It provides strong
confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection [15, 20]. CCMP uses
the AES block cipher, whereas WEP and TKIP use the RC4 stream
cipher. The IEEE 802.11 standards now defines three data encryption
algorithms: WEP, TKIP, and CCMP. As mentioned before, both WEP
and TKIP have inherent weaknesses, and therefore CCMP should
be used when securing wireless networks. This means that 802.11i
requires a WEP user to upgrade its hardware in order to use CCMP,
which is the strongest available security mechanism. The usage of
TKIP is being discouraged by the Wi-Fi Alliance [7], however, WPA2
certified devices are still allowed to support both TKIP and CCMP.
Several vulnerabilities have been found in WPA2 implementations
[28, 35], and more recently we have seen key reinstallation attacks
(KRACKs) against the WPA2 standard itself [33, 34].
In order to solve the issues within the WPA2 standard, the
Wi-Fi Alliance announced a new security standard in 2018 named
Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) [38]. The Wi-Fi Alliance started
certifying devices at the end of 2018, meaning devices supporting
WPA3 are slowly becoming available.
2.2 Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) was designed to fix the
weaknesses of WEP, while still being able to run efficiently on old
hardware. In order to provide confidentiality, TKIP uses the Rivest
Cipher 4 (RC4) stream cipher, which is no longer secure [11]. TKIP
fixes the weaknesses of the WEP IV, and added replay protection,
by using a TKIP Sequence Counter (TSC) [1]. The TSC is 6-byte
long, and is increased monotonically for each Media Access Control
Protocol Data Unit (MPDU). If a received frame has a lower than
expected sequence number, it has to be dropped in order to prevent
replay attacks. The TSC is transmitted in the IV and Extended IV
fields, where the extended IV bit is always set when TKIP is used.
Note that the TSC is different from the sequence number field at the
beginning of the frame. More precisely, the sequence number field
is used to detect retransmissions, and is present even in plaintext
frames. TKIP also added a new integrity check named Michael Mes-
sage Integrity Code (MIC) [10], providing better security against the
alterations of data packets, due to weaknesses in the ICV. Figure 1
shows the simplified construction of a TKIP MPDU.
When constructing TKIP frames, large MAC Service Data Unit
(MSDU) can be fragmented in at most 16 MAC Protocol Data Units
(MPDU) fragments. To encrypt a frame, TKIP first generates a per-
packet key using a two-phase key mixing process [1]. The first
phase uses the transmitter MAC address, Temporal Key (TK), and
the 32 most significant bits of the TSC, to generate a so called
TKIP-mixed Transmit Address and Key (TTAK). The second phase
uses the TTAK, TK and remaining 16 least significant bits of the
TSC to generate the WEP seed. Generating the WEP seed in two
phases is computationally more efficient as the first phase has to be
computed only once every 65536 (216) packets. It is even possible to
calculate the seeds in advance for the reason that the TSC increases
monotonically per MPDU. Next, the Michael algorithm generates
an 8-byte keyed MIC that is calculated over the entire MSDU, as it
takes as input the Michael key, source address, destination address,
priority and plaintext MSDU data. Since the Michael MIC can only
be verified when the entire MSDU has been received by the recipient,
it will be carried in the last MPDU fragment. The resulting MPDUs
are encapsulated through WEP, using the newly generated IV and
RC4 key. WEP encapsulation adds a 4-byte ICV, which is therefore
calculated for each individual MPDU fragment. Finally, a Frame
Check Sequence (FCS) is calculated as a 32-bit CRC over the entire
frame, including the MAC header, and appended to the MPDU.
2.3 TKIP Countermeasures
The Michael MIC provides stronger security guarantees than a
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), but still offers weak defenses

against message forgeries [17]. However, it is the best that could
be achieved on existing hardware. In 2004, it was shown that the
Michael algorithm is invertible [39]. Given that the Michael algo-
rithm provides inadequate security, several countermeasures were
added in order to mitigate attacks [1]. The defined countermeasures
are such that, when a client receives an invalid MIC, it will send a
Michael MIC Failure Report. If an access point receives two such
reports within one minute, all clients using TKIP are temporarily
blocked for one minute. After the one-minute interval the clients
can reassociate and negotiate fresh cryptographic keys. An adver-
sary can easily exploit these countermeasures to perform a Denial
of Service (DoS) against all users [32].
2.4 Quality of Service
The IEEE 802.11e amendment defines Quality of Service (QoS) en-
hancements for wireless LAN networks [2]. The Wi-Fi Alliance
provides an interoperability certification named Wi-Fi Multimedia
(WMM), also known as Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME),
which is a subset of the IEEE 802.11e amendment. The specifica-
tion provides eight different communication channels, representing
different QoS needs. The QoS enhancements have an important
impact on wireless networks supporting TKIP, as the Michael MIC
covers the channel number (i.e., the priority of the frame). Addi-
tionally, under the QoS enhancements each channel has its own
TKIP Sequence Counter (TSC) to verify received frames. As a result,
an adversary can replay a packet on a QoS channel with a lower
TSC, as this approach will bypass the TSC verification [21].
2.5 Beck and Tews Attack
In 2009, Tews and Beck presented the first practical attack against
wireless networks that use TKIP [29]. It is based on the ChopChop
attack against WEP, which enables an adversary to decrypt packets
without knowing the encryption key. The ChopChop attack was
first described by KoreK on the NetStumbler forum in September
2004 [18], and Guennoun et al. have theoretically proven the at-
tack [13]. The attack is possible by exploiting the lack of replay
protection and usage of a weak ICV in the WEP protocol.
The ChopChop attack works by repeatedly chopping off the last
byte of an encrypted message, recovering its value, and repeating
this process for the next byte until the full plaintext is recovered.
Chopping off a byte will result in a corrupted message since the
