User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to check web server logs for SQL injection? If I have a PHP site hosted on Apache and someone hacks it using SQL injection, is there a way I can find out exactly which script caused this by looking at my web server logs?
Or using some other way?

Assistant: I've been using this Linux command string to identify possible SQL injections:

egrep -i '\bUNION\b|\bSELECT\b|\bCHAR\b' $access_log


You could add in other key terms as well, but those were the ones I was finding in my logs. 

To generate a list of offending IP addresses, get a little fancier:

egrep -i '\bUNION\b|\bSELECT\b|\bCHAR\b' $access_log | sed -n 's/\([0-9\.]\+\).*/\1/p' | sort | uniq -c


Which tallies up the offending IPs by the number of instances: 

    335 160.153.153.31
   1197 175.138.67.67
    508 76.72.165.79
    208 92.60.66.184
    111 95.143.64.185
