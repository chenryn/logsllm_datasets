User: Task 12: Explain what load balancing is and what it does
Assistant: Load balancing is a technique to improve the performance, reliability and fault tolerance of a system by distributing the workload among multiple computer resources. The role is mainly in the following three aspects: 1. Improve performance: load balancing can distribute workload to multiple computing resources to avoid overwork of any one of them. This improves overall system performance and responsiveness. 2. Improve reliability: load balancing can distribute the workload to multiple computing resources, even if one of the resources fails, it can continue to run through other resources. This increases the reliability and fault tolerance of the overall system. 3. Improve scalability: load balancing can easily add or remove computing resources to meet changes in demand for the system. This improves the scalability and flexibility of the overall system.
