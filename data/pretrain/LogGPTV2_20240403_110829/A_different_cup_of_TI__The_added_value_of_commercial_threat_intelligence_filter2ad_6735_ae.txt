### Threat Intelligence in Organizations

Threat intelligence (TI) is increasingly being utilized in operational processes, but its application remains limited. Metrics can help optimize the selection of TI sources for event detection and assess the potential for false negatives by evaluating coverage and overlap. These metrics are particularly useful in a more focused context.

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the coverage provided by paid threat intelligence (PTI) vendors due to the secrecy surrounding their methods. While this secrecy is understandable for maintaining operational security against advanced attackers, it complicates the evaluation process for customers. This paper aims to address this issue by comparing indicators from leading PTI providers to analyze overlap and timeliness. Our findings indicate that even when examining the same actor groups, two leading PTI providers have significantly divergent information with minimal overlap.

The opacity of their methods also benefits vendors economically. As long as their techniques remain undisclosed, myths persist about the unique capabilities of TI providers, possibly through exclusive skill sets, 'hacking back,' or access to restricted information. Shires [36] notes that vendors often use "cyber noir" symbols to portray their work as deploying unconventional tactics in mythical battles between good and evil, often aligned with national security. Such narratives contribute to an unverifiable perception of the detection and attribution capabilities of PTI vendors.

### Market Implications

The low transparency in the PTI market leads to asymmetric information, where vendors know what they are selling, but customers are uncertain about what they are buying. This makes it difficult for consumers to compare services [20, 14]. Metcalf [25] highlighted in 2015 that secrecy does not benefit operational analysts who must decide which lists to apply. Even five years later, our respondents describe it as "mostly guesswork" to understand the visibility and methods of paid TI providers, and thus the value of their services.

In such conditions of information asymmetry, buyers rely on signals, such as whether a firm is seen as a market leader, often indicated by high service prices. The phrase 'nobody ever got fired for buying IBM' holds true for threat intelligence, as customers are incentivized to choose leading providers under uncertainty. However, structural information asymmetry risks eroding customer trust in the value of PTI services over time, potentially decreasing willingness to pay. This effect is known as a 'market for lemons' [2]. Grigg [38] further argues that even vendors may lack reliable information on the quality of their products. Providers may know what data they collect and how, but they cannot accurately gauge the effectiveness of their product in improving client security. Our analysis suggests that, given the lack of ground truth and low indicator overlap, vendors themselves may be uncertain about their ability to track specific threat actors. When both seller and buyer lack reliable information on product quality, this creates a market for 'silver bullets,' where herding behavior and arbitrary best practices dominate rational purchasing decisions.

### Political and Economic Significance

Through their forensic work, TI vendors significantly influence public and political understanding of security incidents. Reporting on these incidents involves not just technical analysis but also interpretation and 'sense-making.' Public understanding is shaped by the political and economic perspectives of the experts conducting the analysis [13, 42]. Therefore, information asymmetry in the PTI market has both economic and political implications.

### Related Work

There is extensive research on open threat intelligence (OTI), including abuse feeds and blocklists, which consistently highlight issues with coverage, timeliness, and accuracy [39, 25, 19]. Recent proposals aim to formalize and measure TI quality, focusing on features such as coverage, accuracy, timeliness, relevance, overlap, latency, and volume [21, 33, 15, 29, 30, 27]. Li et al. [21] and Griffioen et al. [15] have applied these approaches to OTI, but applications to PTI are limited.

### Operational Issues

Organizations face challenges in interpreting threat intelligence, triaging large volumes of threat information, and dealing with false positives [31]. While contextual, high-level TI has the potential to address these issues [6], a 2019 SANS survey found that low-level indicators of compromise (IOCs) were valued higher than information about high-level tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) [7]. This is attributed to the fact that many respondents were security operations analysts who primarily view TI as a means to enrich alerts with technical details.

### Empirical Study

Our study provides a detailed analysis of how TI is used within organizations and how its value is perceived. We go beyond existing research in two key ways: first, we present the first empirical study of PTI from market leaders. Second, we contextualize these quantitative approaches by conducting a user study to identify perceptions of value. This reveals that users evaluate TI differently from the metrics proposed by researchers. In reality, users rarely calculate these metrics, and their perception of value is influenced by various use cases where quantification is either missing or conflicting.

### Limitations

Our mixed-methods approach has several limitations. First, we analyzed only two PTI vendors, assuming that our findings are representative of the high-end market. Second, our analysis was based on data from a single customer, which may not fully represent all subsets. Third, we faced a lack of ground truth and relied on comparative analysis and expert mapping. Fourth, the comparison with OTI was limited to a single month of four feeds. Fifth, our user study had a small sample size (n=14) and potential selection bias, limiting generalizability.

### Conclusions

This study explored the market of commercial threat intelligence, analyzing indicators from two paid TI vendors. We found minimal overlap in their indicators, raising questions about the actual coverage provided by these services. Paid TI reports, while more comprehensive, do not differ significantly in substance from open-source blog posts and tweets. In terms of timeliness, PTI did not show faster response times compared to OTI. The main use case for TI is network detection, followed by situational awareness and resource prioritization in the SOC. Respondents value actionability, relevance, and confidence, but only half consider coverage important. Evaluation of TI sources is largely informal, with professionals relying on implicit criteria and tacit understanding of value.

The promise of leading PTI vendors to overcome the problem of sharing threat information among defenders is not fully realized. Even when vendors claim to track the same threat actors, they see only a small fraction of the associated indicators. This pattern, similar to OTI, suggests that aggregating data across clients and networks does not significantly improve detection capability. Sharing indicators across vendors would be a step toward better coverage and detection, but the current state of the PTI market resembles the anti-phishing and malware detection markets, where data sharing eventually became essential.
