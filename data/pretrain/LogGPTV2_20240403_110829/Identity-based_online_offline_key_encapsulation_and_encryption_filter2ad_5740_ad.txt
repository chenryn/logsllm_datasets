### Notation and Definitions
- **SM**: Scalar multiplication in group \( G \).
- **EXP**: Exponentiation in group \( G_T \).
- **M SM**: Multi-scalar multiplication in group \( G \).
- **M EXP**: Multi-exponentiation in group \( G_T \) (approximately 1.3 times more costly than a single scalar multiplication or exponentiation, respectively).
- **P A**: Point addition in groups \( G \) or \( G_T \).
- **M U L**: Modular computation in \( \mathbb{Z}_q \).
- **SE**: CCA-secure symmetric key encryption.

### GMC BB Online/Offline Signature for Encryption
For a fair comparison, we use an efficient instantiation from [4]. The costs involved are as follows:
- **Offline storage and signature length**: 320 bits.
- **Key generation and offline signing**: 1 SM operation each.
- **Signature verification**: 1 pairing operation.
- **Decryption algorithm**: Requires the verification of one signature, which explains the (+1) in the decryption cost.

### Comparison of Computation Cost and Size

### Key Improvements
1. **Online Computation**:
   - Our schemes (both CPA and CCA) require only 1 modular computation (M U L) in the online stage.
   - No point addition (P A) or symmetric encryption is required in the online encryption stage.
   - Modular computation (M U L) is significantly faster than point addition (P A), making our online encryption stage the fastest among all other schemes.

2. **Offline Storage**:
   - For the CPA version, the offline storage is the smallest at 800 bits.
   - For the CCA version, it is 30% smaller than GMC BB and about 3 times smaller than GMC G.
   - This is particularly important for embedded devices with limited storage.

3. **Ciphertext Size**:
   - Both CPA and CCA versions of our schemes have the smallest ciphertexts.
   - The CPA scheme is 50% smaller than LZ, and the CCA scheme is 30% smaller than CLZBD.
   - Compared to GMC BB and GMC G, the improvements are even more significant: almost 3 times smaller than GMC BB and 8 times smaller than GMC G.
   - This is crucial in environments with limited communication bandwidth, such as those with computationally-limited devices.

4. **Decryption Stage**:
   - Both our schemes require only 1 pairing operation in the decryption stage, which is the minimum requirement for efficient identity-based encryption (IBE) schemes.
   - This is about 4 times less than CLZBD.
   - Although decryption is typically done on the server side with more computational power, this improvement is significant when decrypting a large number of ciphertexts, as pairing operations are the most time and power-consuming algorithms.

### Security Proof
Our security proof is given in the random oracle model. While a reductionist proof in the random oracle model may be considered heuristic, it still achieves an acceptable level of security. Schemes with security analysis assuming random oracles are generally more efficient than those with similar features but with proofs in the standard model. For applications where efficiency is the most important factor, schemes with security analysis in the random oracle model may be a better choice.

### Optimized CPA Version
We provide an optimized CPA version for scenarios where CPA security is sufficient and CCA security is unnecessary. This version has a ciphertext size of just 640 bits and offline storage of 800 bits, making it ideal for very low-power devices.

### Conclusion and Future Work
We have proposed a new and efficient identity-based online/offline encryption scheme with two versions: a highly efficient CPA version and a CCA version that achieves the highest security level. Compared to previous constructions, our scheme offers significant improvements in efficiency, making it suitable for practical scenarios such as smart cards and wireless sensor networks. The security of our schemes is analyzed in the random oracle model.

Our study of the notion of identity-based online/offline key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and the online/offline preserving CCA-transformation may be of independent interest. Future research can focus on devising a very efficient KEM that is only one-way secure. Additionally, we plan to explore online/offline ID-based signcryption and attribute-based encryption schemes, as well as online/offline schemes for special IBE, such as IBE for complex hierarchies, which may find application in weak devices like publish/subscribe systems over wireless sensor networks.
