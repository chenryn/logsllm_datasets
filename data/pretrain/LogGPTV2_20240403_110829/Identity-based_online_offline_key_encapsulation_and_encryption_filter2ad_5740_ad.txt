We denote by SM the scalar multiplication in G, EXP the
exponentiation in GT , M SM the multi-scalar multiplication
in G, M EXP the multi-exponentiation in GT (which cost
about 1.3 times more than a single scalar multiplication or
a single exponentiation respectively), P A the point addition
in G or GT , M U L the modular computation in Zq and SE
the CCA secure symmetric key encryption.
GMC BB requires an online/o(cid:15)ine signature for encryption.
For a fair comparison, we take a very e(cid:14)cient instantiation
in [4]. The costs involved are as follow { 320 bits for o(cid:15)ine
storage and for signature length, and 1 SM operation for the
key generation and for the o(cid:15)ine signing, which have been
added to the table. Each signature veri(cid:12)cation requires one
pairing operation and their decryption algorithm requires
the veri(cid:12)cation of one signature, which explains the (+1) in
the decryption cost listed in the table.
Table 1 shows that our scheme achieves the least compu-
tation and the smallest size in both o(cid:15)ine and online stage.
There are a number of signi(cid:12)cant improvements:
1. Online computation is the main focus of online/o(cid:15)ine
encryption. Our schemes (both CPA and CCA) on-
ly require 1 modular computation in the online stage.
Our schemes do not require any point addition (P A
operation) or symmetric encryption in the online en-
cryption stage. Modular computation (M U L opera-
tion) is much faster than P A operation. Thus our
online encryption stage is the fastest among all other
schemes.
2. The o(cid:15)ine storage is very small. For the CPA version,
it is the smallest among all other schemes. It just re-
quires 800 bits. For the CCA version, it is also smaller
than GMC BB by 30% and about 3 times smaller than
GMC G . This result is important for embedded devices
with very limited storage.
3. The ciphertexts of our schemes (both CPA and CCA)
are the smallest among all other schemes. For the C-
PA scheme, it is about 50% smaller than LZ, while for
the CCA scheme, it is also 30% smaller than CLZBD.
When compared to GMC BB and GMC G , the improve-
ments are even greater. It is almost 3 times smaller
than GMC BB and 8 times smaller than GMC G . This im-
provement is very signi(cid:12)cant when the communication
bandwidth is very limited, which is typical in the en-
vironment where computationally-limited devices are
deployed.
4. Both our schemes only require 1 pairing operation in
the decryption stage, which is the minimum require-
ment for any e(cid:14)cient identity-based encryption scheme
in the state-of-the-art4. It is about 4 times less than
CLZBD. Although decryption is usually done in the
4Up to now, all e(cid:14)cient IBE schemes require pairing in
the decryption stage. IBE schemes that do not require any
pairing are still relatively ine(cid:14)cient.

Table 1: Comparison of computation cost and size
server side with more computation power, for decryp-
tion of a huge number of ciphertexts, this improvement
will be signi(cid:12)cant as pairing is the most time and pow-
er consuming algorithm.
We remark that our security proof is given in the random
oracle model. While a reductionist proof in the random or-
acle model may be considered as a heuristic argument since
no real-world hash function can be used to instantiate the
random oracle, arguably it still achieves an acceptable level
of security. On the other hand, in general, a scheme with
security analysis assuming the random oracles is more e(cid:14)-
cient than a scheme with similar features but with a proof in
the standard model. There are many applications that put
e(cid:14)ciency as the most important factor. In these scenarios,
schemes that are e(cid:14)cient but with security analysis only in
the random oracle model maybe a better choice.
In addition, we provide an optimized CPA version, for
scenarios where CPA security is enough and CCA security
maybe an overkill. The size of the ciphertext is just 640
bits and the o(cid:15)ine storage is just 800 bits. It provides an
excellent environment for those very low power devices to
carry out \secure enough" encryption.
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have proposed a new and e(cid:14)cient identity-based on-
line/o(cid:15)ine encryption scheme. We provided two versions: a
very e(cid:14)cient CPA version and a CCA version that achieves
the highest security level. When compared to previous con-
structions, our scheme (both versions) enjoys a number of
signi(cid:12)cant improvements in e(cid:14)ciency. These improvements
allow our scheme to be used in many practical scenarios such
as smart card and wireless sensor networks. The security of
our schemes are analyzed in the random oracle model.
Our study of the notion of identity-based online/o(cid:15)ine
key encapsulation mechanism, and the online/o(cid:15)ine pre-
serving CCA-transformation may be of independent inter-
ests. Research e(cid:11)ort can now be made in devising a very
e(cid:14)cient KEM that is only one-way secure.
Since our scheme is based on the widely used Sakai and
Kasahara IBE [26, 8] or more generally, the exponent-inversion
framework [6], applications are numerous. We leave the
details of an online/o(cid:15)ine ID-based signcryption scheme
based on [1], and an online/o(cid:15)ine attribute-based encryp-
tion scheme based on [6] as our future work. Another inter-
esting direction is to devise online/o(cid:15)ine scheme for \spe-
cial" IBE such as IBE for complex hierarchy [32], which may
(cid:12)nd application when encryption is done in weak devices
such as publish/subscribe system over wireless sensor net-
works [15].
