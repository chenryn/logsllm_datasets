User: How do I learn where the source file for a given Python module is installed? Is the method different on Windows than on Linux?
I'm trying to look for the source of the datetime module in particular, but I'm interested in a more general answer as well.
Assistant: For those who prefer a GUI solution: if you're using a gui such as Spyder (part of the Anaconda installation) you can just right-click the module name (such as "csv" in "import csv") and select "go to definition" - this will open the file, but also on the top you can see the exact file location ("C:....csv.py")
