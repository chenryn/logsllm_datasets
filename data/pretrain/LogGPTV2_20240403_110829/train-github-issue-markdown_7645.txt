With #222 merged any ideas how to add a loader for TypeScript in
next.config.js?
I've tried adding a TypeScript specific loader like this
    const path = require('path');
    const nextPagesDir = path.join(__dirname, 'pages');
    const typescriptLoader = {
      test: /\.ts(x?)$/,
      loader: ['ts-loader'],
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      include: [
        nextPagesDir
      ]
    };
    module.exports = {
      webpack: (config) => {
        config.module.rules.push(typescriptLoader);
        return config;
      }
    }
but assume additional changes need to be made as well as additional entries
for hot loading etc.
Another question is should the TypeScript loader be used in with babel e.g.
`loaders: ['babel-loader', 'ts-loader']`
If so I'd need to apply the same babel options as in webpack.js.
