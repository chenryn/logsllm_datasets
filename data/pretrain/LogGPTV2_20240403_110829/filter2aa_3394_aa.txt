**FOREWORD**

Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks are essential for public safety communications. In support of the Public Safety Wireless Network (PSWN) Program Management Office (PMO), Booz•Allen & Hamilton conducted an analysis of conventional, trunked, and hybrid system architectures to provide background information to public safety system planners on the different architectural alternatives.

This report, "Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Radio Systems," focuses on typical system architectures but does not analyze specific vendor systems, implementations, or technical requirements. The report does not reflect a government position or endorse any particular type of LMR network architecture.

**1.0 INTRODUCTION**

The increasing demand for frequency spectrum, a finite resource, necessitates the development of more spectrum-efficient systems. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems are evolving significantly, with the introduction of narrowband digital LMR systems, the deployment of 800 MHz systems, the incorporation of advanced user services and features, and the development of alternative network architectures. System planners must conduct a wide range of comparative analyses to determine the most suitable system for their environment and requirements. Public safety agencies, in particular, must consider the special requirements imposed by their mission and operations.

A critical decision for LMR system planners is selecting the appropriate system architecture to meet technical, operational, and environmental requirements. Generally, LMR systems are designed using one of three architectures: conventional, trunked, or a hybrid of the two. The selection is based on factors such as spectrum, technical features, operational requirements, and cost considerations.

"Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Radio Systems" aims to provide background information for system planners, especially those in public safety agencies, to assist in evaluating architecture options. Specifically, the report:
- Informs system planners about the technical components and operational characteristics of LMR system architectures.
- Identifies essential technical and operational characteristics and considerations related to LMR performance and public safety communication requirements.
- Analyzes each architecture to highlight performance characteristics and the essential differences among the alternatives.
- Provides system planners with descriptive information, analysis results, and operational considerations to facilitate decision-making.

This document compares conventional, trunked, and hybrid LMR systems, providing high-level definitions of the architecture alternatives and analysis considerations. It then discusses each consideration as it applies to each architecture alternative.

**2.0 LMR TECHNOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURES**

### 2.1 Brief History of LMR

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines a land mobile radio system as a regularly interacting group of base, mobile, and associated control and fixed relay stations intended to provide land mobile radio communications service over a single area of operation. The term "mobile" refers to the movement of the radio, not necessarily its association with a vehicle, thus including handheld and portable radios.

The possibility of radio communications was established in 1864 by James Clerk Maxwell, who showed theoretically that an electrical disturbance, propagating at the speed of light, could produce an effect at a distance. This theory was first put into practice by Hertz, who demonstrated spark-gap communications over distances of several feet in the 1880s. Marconi extended this distance, transmitting Morse code across the Atlantic Ocean by 1901. The vacuum tube made speech transmissions practical, and by 1915, the American Telephone & Telegraph company had sent speech transmissions from Washington, D.C., to Paris and Honolulu.

The first practical land mobile communications occurred in 1928 when the Detroit Police Department solved the instability and low sensitivity problems that had plagued their mobile receiver designs for seven years. By 1933, a mobile transmitter had been developed, allowing the first two-way police system to operate in Bayonne, New Jersey. The success of a state-wide Connecticut highway patrol system using frequency modulation (FM) in 1939 led to a nationwide phase-out of amplitude modulated equipment.

By 1933, the need for radio regulation was apparent, and the first operating rules were mandated by the Federal Radio Commission. The Federal Communications Commission was established one year later. Twenty-nine very high frequency (VHF) channels between 30 and 40 MHz (known today as low band) were allocated for police use. In 1946, the initial rules for the Domestic Public Land Mobile Radio Service were established, and high band frequencies between 152 and 162 MHz were allocated. Small businesses could now purchase airtime from common carriers, avoiding the large startup costs of a private system. Previously, only certain industries had access to mobile radio frequencies, such as public safety, public utilities, transportation, and the media.

Since then, the rapid growth of the land mobile radio industry has been accompanied by substantial additional spectrum allocations in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band (406 to 512 MHz) and the 800- and 900-MHz bands. However, practical mobile spectrum is unlikely to increase significantly because there is little left to allocate, leading to a strong push toward more efficient use of the existing spectrum.

Increased efficiency can be achieved through technological advancements in frequency control, which have allowed the 900-MHz band to be channelized at 12.5 kHz. Major improvements have also been made in speech coding and modulation efficiency. Trunking of groups of radio channels allows operation at much higher loading levels than single channels can handle with acceptable access delay. Finally, the cellular radio telephone service introduced in 1981 has boosted spectrum efficiency through geographic reuse of channels in the same metropolitan coverage area.

These advances in technology have a profound effect on public safety communications infrastructure and operations, as described later in this study.

Typically, LMR systems are designed using one of three architectures: conventional, trunked, or hybrid, which is a combination of the two. This section briefly describes these architectures and their principal differences.

### 2.2 Conventional Systems

#### 2.2.1 Simplex Operation

In simplex operation, one terminal of the system transmits while the other terminal receives. Simultaneous transmission and reception at a terminal are not possible. The simplex dispatching system consists of a base station and mobile units, all operating on a single frequency. Simplex operation is sometimes referred to as single-frequency simplex.

#### 2.2.2 Half-Duplex Operation

In half-duplex dispatching systems, the base station and the mobile transmit on two different frequencies. The base station transmits on the mobile's receive frequency and vice versa. However, half-duplex terminal equipment does not allow simultaneous transmission and reception. Half-duplex operation is sometimes referred to as two-frequency simplex.

Half-duplex configuration was designed to allow a repeater-type operation, where a base station "repeats" and amplifies a mobile’s signal on a different frequency (see Exhibit 1). Half-duplex operation is commonly used in public safety LMR systems.

#### 2.2.3 Full-Duplex Operation

In full-duplex operations, radios can transmit and receive simultaneously. As in half-duplex, this operation uses two frequencies, but the transmitter and receiver can be both powered and active full-time. Repeater base stations typically operate in full-duplex mode, receiving on one frequency and re-transmitting the signal on another frequency, using separate transmit and receive antennas. For full-duplex single-antenna configurations, additional equipment such as a duplexer is required, enabling the receiver and transmitter to use the same antenna simultaneously. LMR systems rarely use this type of operation, as full-duplex subscriber units are typically more expensive and, if battery-powered, consume more battery power.

### 2.3 Techniques for Improving and Extending Area Coverage

#### 2.3.1 Single-Site Systems

Initially, LMR systems were built as single-site systems designed to provide coverage for small geographical areas such as factories, small towns, or manufacturing facilities. Single-site systems, which initially consisted of one simplex base station, evolved into base station repeaters operating in a half-duplex fashion with a paired set of frequencies (see Exhibit 1). Mobile radio users communicate with a dispatch or other radio users by accessing the base station repeater, which retransmits the signal on the mobile receive frequency to all user radios. It also facilitates communication with the dispatch console operator through the base station without using the repeater function. In all cases, the user radio must be within the range of coverage of the repeater, base station, or other radio asset.

**Exhibit 1: Single-Site Conventional System Configuration Operating in Half or Full Duplex**

#### 2.3.2 Receiver Voting Systems

The base transmitter in an LMR system typically has much more power than mobiles or portable radios. The base antenna is usually at a much higher elevation than mobile or portable radio antennas, limiting mobiles and portables' talkback capability.

One way to improve talkback capability is to use a receiver voting system (see Exhibit 2). A number of radio receivers located in strategic areas receive the RF signal from a mobile or portable unit. Receive-only sites act as "listening-only" base stations that receive the lower power signals of mobiles and portables and relay them back to a base station or repeater, usually via dedicated telephone or microwave links. By using one or more receive-only sites in conjunction with a high-power base station or repeater transceiver, the overall system talkback coverage can be expanded. A receiver voter or comparator selects the best receive signal, which is then heard by the dispatcher.

To provide reliable talkback coverage when hand-held radios are used, the number of voting receivers must be increased, due to the lower transmitter power and antenna efficiency.

**Exhibit 2: Receiver Voting System**

#### 2.3.3 Multi-Site Systems

Multi-site systems extend coverage by using multiple base stations or repeaters, each covering a different area. These systems can be configured in various ways, such as simulcast or multicast, to provide seamless coverage over a larger area.
