FOREWORD
Land mobile radio (LMR) networks are critical for public safety communications.  In
support of the Public Safety Wireless Network (PSWN) Program Management Office (PMO),
Booz•Allen & Hamilton analyzed conventional, trunked, and hybrid system architectures to
provide background information to public safety system planners on the different architecture
alternatives.
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Radio Systems considers typical systems
architectures.  However, it does not analyze specific vendor systems, implementations, or
technical requirements.
This report does not reflect a government position or endorse a particular type of LMR
network architecture.

INTRODUCTION
Increasing demands on frequency spectrum, a finite resource, force users create
conditions force users to look for more spectrum-efficient systems, which the market is
manufacturing along with increased features.  Land mobile radio (LMR) systems are changing
significantly.  These changes include the introduction of narrowband digital LMR systems, the
deployment of 800 megahertz (MHz) systems, the incorporation of advanced user services and
features, and the development of alternative network architectures.  Therefore, system planners
may need to conduct a wide range of comparative analyses to determine the type of system that is
most appropriate for their environment and requirements.  Planners in public safety agencies
need to consider, in addition, the special requirements imposed by their mission and operations.
An essential decision for LMR system planners is determining which system architecture
should be implemented to meet technical, operational, and environmental requirements.  In
general, LMR systems are designed using one of three architectures: conventional, trunked, or a
hybrid of the two.  The selection of one architecture over the others is based on a range of factors,
including spectrum, technical features, operational requirements, and cost considerations.
Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Radio Systems is intended to provide
background information for system planners, especially those in public safety agencies, to assist
them in their evaluation of architecture options.  Specifically the report—
• Informs system planners about the technical components and operational
characteristics of LMR system architectures.
• Identifies essential technical and operational characteristics and considerations that
relate to LMR performance and public safety communication requirements.
• Analyzes each architecture to highlight performance characteristics of, and the
essential differences among, the alternatives.
• Provides system planners with descriptive information, analysis results, and
operational considerations to foster decision making.
This document analyzes and compares conventional, trunked, and hybrid LMR systems.
It provides high-level definitions of the architecture alternatives and analysis considerations.  It
then discusses each consideration as it applies to each of the architecture alternatives.

LMR TECHNOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURES
2.1
Brief History of LMR
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) rules define a land mobile radio system as a
regularly interacting group of base, mobile, and associated control and fixed relay stations
intended to provide land mobile radio communications service over a single area of operation.
The term mobile refers to movement of the radio, rather than association with a vehicle; hence
mobile radio encompasses handheld and portable radios.
The possibility of radio communications was established in 1864 by James Clerk
Maxwell, then a professor of physics at Cambridge University.  Maxwell showed theoretically
that an electrical disturbance, propagating at the speed of light, could produce an effect at a
distance.  Theory was first put into practice by Hertz, who demonstrated spark-gap
communications over distances of several feet in the 1880s.  The distance was rapidly extended
by Marconi, who by 1901 succeeded in transmitting Morse code across the Atlantic ocean. The
vacuum tube made speech transmissions practical and by 1915 the American Telephone &
Telegraph company had sent speech transmissions from Washington, D.C., to Paris and
Honolulu.
The first practical land mobile communications occurred in 1928 when the Detroit Police
Department finally succeeded in solving the instability and low sensitivity problems that had
plagued their mobile receiver designs for 7 years.  By 1933, a mobile transmitter had been
developed, allowing the first two-way police system to operate in Bayonne, New Jersey.  The
1939 success of a state-wide Connecticut highway patrol system using frequency modulation
(FM) led to a nationwide phase-out of amplitude modulated equipment.
By 1933 the need for radio regulation was also apparent and the first operating rules were
mandated by the Federal Radio Commission.  The Federal Communications Commission was
established one year later.  Twenty-nine very high frequency (VHF) channels between 30 and 40
MHz (known today as low band) were allocated for police use.  In 1946 the initial rules for the
Domestic Public Land Mobile Radio Service were established and high band frequencies
between 152 and 162 MHz were allocated.  Small businesses could now purchase airtime from
common carriers, thus avoiding the large startup costs of a private system.  Previously only
certain industries had access to mobile radio frequencies; for example, public safety, public
utilities, transportation, and the media.
Since then, the rapid growth of the land mobile radio industry has been accompanied by
substantial additional spectrum allocations in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band (406 to
512 MHz), and the 800- and 900-MHz bands.  Nonetheless, it appears that practical mobile
spectrum is unlikely to significantly increase because there is nothing left to allocate; hence,
today’s strong push toward more efficient use of the spectrum already allocated.

Increased efficiency can be achieved in a variety of ways.  Technological advancements
in frequency control have allowed the 900-MHz band to be channelized at 12.5 kHz.  Major
improvements have been occurring in speech coding and modulation efficiency.  Trunking of
groups of radio channels allows operation at much higher loading levels than single channels can
handle with acceptable access delay.  Finally, the cellular radio telephone service introduced in
1981 has boosted spectrum efficiency through geographic reuse of channels in the same
metropolitan coverage area. [1]
These advances in technology have a profound effect on public safety communications
infrastructure and operations described later in this study.
Typically, LMR systems are designed using one of three architectures: conventional,
trunked, or hybrid, which is a combination of the two.  This section briefly describes the
architectures and principal differences between them.
2.2
Conventional Systems
2.2.1 Simplex
In simplex operation one terminal of the system transmits while the other terminal
receives.  Simultaneous transmission and reception at a terminal is not possible with simplex
operation.  The simplex dispatching system consists of a base station and mobile units, all
operating on a single frequency.
Simplex operation is sometimes referred to as single-frequency simplex. [2]
2.2.2 Half Duplex
In half-duplex dispatching systems, the base station and the mobile transmit on two
different frequencies.  The base station transmits on the mobile’s receive frequency and vice
versa.  However, the half-duplex terminal equipment does not allow simultaneous transmission
and reception.  Half-duplex operation is sometimes referred to as two-frequency simplex. [2]
Half-duplex configuration was designed to allow a repeater-type of operation, when a
base station "repeats" and amplifies a mobile’s signal on a different frequency (see Exhibit 1).
Half-duplex operation is used most commonly in public safety LMR systems.
2.2.3 Full Duplex
In full-duplex operations, radios can transmit and receive simultaneously.  As in half
duplex, this operation uses two frequencies, the difference is that transmitter and receiver can be
both powered and active full time. Repeater base stations typically operated in full-duplex mode,
receiving on one frequency and re-transmitting the signal on another frequency, using separate

transmit and receive antennas.  For full-duplex single-antenna configuration, additional
equipment is required such as duplexer, which enables the receiver and transmitter to use the
same antenna simultaneously.  LMR systems rarely use this type of operation, since full-duplex
subscriber units are typically much more expensive and, if battery-powered, consume more
battery power.
2.3
Techniques for Improving and Extending Area Coverage
2.3.1
Single-Site Systems
In the beginning, LMR systems were built as single-site systems.  A single-site system
was designed to provide coverage for a small geographical area such as a factory, small town, or
manufacturing facility.  Single-site systems, which initially consisted of one simplex base station,
evolved into the base station repeater which operated in a half-duplex fashion with a paired set of
frequencies as shown in Exhibit 1. Mobile radio users communicate with a dispatch or other
radio users by accessing the base station repeater, which retransmits the signal on the mobile
receive frequency to all user radios.  It also facilitates communicating with the dispatch console
operator through the base station without using the repeater function.  In all cases, the user radio
must be within the range of coverage of the repeater, base station, or other radio asset.

2.3.2
Receiver Voting Systems
The base transmitter in a LMR system typically has much more power than mobiles or
portable radios. The base antenna is typically at a much higher elevation than mobile or portable
radio antennas.  For these reasons, mobiles and portables communications are limited by their
talkback capability.

Receiver Voting System
One way to improve the talkback capability is to use a receiver voting system, as shown
in Exhibit 2.  A number of radio receivers located in strategic areas receive the RF signal from a
mobile or portable unit.  Receive-only sites act as “listening-only” base stations that receive the
lower power signals of mobiles and portables and relay them back to a base station or repeater,
usually via dedicated telephone or microwave links. By using one or more receive-only sites in
conjunction with a high-power base station or repeater transceiver, the overall system talk back
coverage can be expanded.  A receiver voter or comparator is used to select the best receive
signal.  The comparator is usually located in a dispatching center.  The "best" signal is voted in
the comparator and the dispatcher hears that voted audio.
To provide a reliable talkback coverage when hand-held radios are used, the number of
voting receivers must be increased considerably, compared to mobile-only talkback coverage,
because of the lower transmitter power and antenna efficiency. [2]
