ABSTRACT
While it is important to design anonymity systems to be
robust against attacks, it is also important to provide good
performance to users. We explore ways to improve the se-
curity and performance of anonymity systems by building
both security and performance properties into the network
topology. In particular, we study an expander graph based
network topology and apply link-based performance metrics
in order to build the topology graph. Such a network can be
constructed to have enhanced performance and similar se-
curity properties to restricted route topologies with random
links. Results show that a sparse, D-regular expander graph
topology provides nearly the same security, as measured by
the likelihood of an incoming stream exiting through any
node in the network, as with a fully-connected graph. Fur-
ther, when the expander graph is constructed with a bias
towards faster links, there is a considerable gain in perfor-
mance without much loss of security.

INTRODUCTION
Mix-based anonymity systems consist of a network of mixes
that are used to relay user traﬃc. If a user Alice, wants to
communicate with another user Bob via the mix network,
she ﬁrst chooses a sequence of mixes over which to route her
messages. Alice is free to pick whichever mixes she wants to
include in her path, starting with herself and ending in the
ﬁnal mix, such that for the duration of the connection her
messages are routed over this path.
In multi-hop anonymity systems, selection of routes through
the mixes has signiﬁcant impact on traﬃc analysis resistance

and network performance. For low-latency anonymity sys-
tems this is a more important consideration since delay in
routing can expose the anonymity of the users more easily
[7]. Systems like Tor [9], MixMinion [6], MixMaster [3] and
Anonymizer [1] adopted various network topologies but it
has been a matter of debate which one is superior.
In [11] the authors describe a link-based path selection
strategy that chooses in favor of higher performing links.
Berthold et al. suggest that users pick from a set of pre-
determined paths called a cascades of mixes [4].
In this
paper, we consider network latency along with padding and
anonymity metrics to build a restricted topology. Earlier
work [5] establishes that a restricted network topology such
as an expander graph improves security against intersection
attacks in anonymity networks. We ﬁrst reconﬁrm their
work by showing that when the network topology is based
on an expander graph, the number of intermediate mixes or
hops needed for Alice to achieve comparable security as in
a fully connected topology, does not increase signiﬁcantly.
The number of hops is an important metric because fewer
the hops that Alice’s messages need to get to the destina-
tion better is the performance experienced by her connec-
tions. We further show that when the anonymous network
topology is created with a bias towards lower latency edges,
there is a signiﬁcant improvement in performance compared
to an unbiased expander topology. Shaping the topology
to include more low latency edges could mean the resulting
topology might not oﬀer the same security guarantees as an
unbiased topology. Our results however show that shaping
the topology to improve performance does not severely im-
pact the security properties of the graph.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 discusses the properties of expander and shaped ex-
pander graph topologies. Section 3 describes the simulation
setup and results for expander and shaped expander graph
topologies. Finally, section 4 summarizes our contributions
and discusses possible future work.
2. EXPANDER GRAPH TOPOLOGIES
In this section, we describe expander graphs, how they can
be constructed, and how we can construct shaped expander
graphs that take into account link-based performance met-
rics. Expander graphs are sparse graphs that show high
connectivity. These graphs are common in the natural world
and can be used to model social networks, relationships be-
tween species, and organizations. A graph G = (V, E) in
which every vertex has exactly D neighbors is called D-
regular graph. A D-regular graph is an (A, K)-expander if

for every subset S ⊆ V of vertices in G, such that | S |≤ K,
then | N (S) |> A| S |. Here | S | is the number of ver-
tices in S and | N (S) | is the number of vertices in S
that
share an edge with any vertex in S. This means that though
expander graphs contain a relatively small number of edges
per vertex D compared to a complete graph with the same
number of vertices, they have excellent connectivity proper-
ties enabling them to be extremely fast mixing. Fast mixing
networks have the characteristic that a random walk on such
graphs will converge to the stationary distribution in rela-
tively few hops. The property of having fewer number of
edges per vertex combined with the fast-mixing property of
expander graphs can be leveraged to provide better security
and performance in mix-based anonymous networks.
2.1 Random Expander Construction
Expander graphs can be generated using distributed algo-
rithms or by using the popular zig-zag[10] method. For our
simulations, we chose the distributed method of expander
construction described in [8]. This method begins with an
initial set of three nodes and grows as each new node arrives
and joins the network. If the neighbors for a new node are
selected randomly from the set of existing nodes, the result-
ing topology is called a Random Expander (RE) topology.
2.2 Shaped Expanders
In order to achieve the security beneﬁts of an expander
and at the same time obtain improved performance, we
propose a latency-based expander topology in which neigh-
bors of a node are chosen with a bias towards low-latency
edges. We call the resulting topology a Shaped Expander
(SE) topology. The resulting expander will have a number of
high performance links as compared to a random expander.
This means a path chosen through a shaped expander net-
work has a higher probability of experiencing better perfor-
mance than a path chosen through a random expander or a
fully connected topology.
The trade-oﬀ for having a better performance is that the
topology generated by biased edge selection is not theoret-
ically an expander and may lack the expansion properties
of a random expander. One implication is that a shaped
expander topology may not mix fully in O(logN ) hops. To
study the trade-oﬀ between performance and security we
simulated and compared the security and performance of
fully connected versus random and shaped expander graph
topologies.
2.3 Shaping and Routing Bias
Snader and Borisov [12] propose a way to choose mix
nodes to bias selection towards nodes that provide higher
