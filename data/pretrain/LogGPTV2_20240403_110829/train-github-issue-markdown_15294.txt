I initially raised this issue in the Julia Users group with the following example:

```julia
julia> list = ["a", "b", "c"]
       for i in enumerate(list)
         println(i)
       end
(1, "a")
(2, "b")
(3, "c")
```

However, when I attempted to run the loop in parallel, I encountered an error:

```julia
julia> addprocs(2)
       @parallel for i in enumerate(list)
         println(i)
       end
ERROR: `getindex` has no method matching getindex(::Enumerate{Array{ASCIIString,1}}, ::UnitRange{Int64})
```

As @Ismael-VC pointed out in the user group, the issue can be resolved by converting the `enumerate` object to a collection before using it in a parallel loop:

```julia
julia> @parallel for i in collect(enumerate(list))
                      println(i)
           end
```

While this solution works, it is somewhat confusing that the behavior of `enumerate()` changes depending on whether the loop is executed in parallel or not.
