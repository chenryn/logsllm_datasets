I first brought this up in the julia users group here:
    julia> list = ["a", "b", "c"]
           for i in enumerate(list)
             println(i)
           end
    (1,"a")
    (2,"b")
    (3,"c")
But:
    julia> addprocs(2)
           @parallel for i in enumerate(list)
             println(i)
           end
    ERROR: `getindex` has no method matching getindex(::Enumerate{Array{ASCIIString,1}}, ::UnitRange{Int64})
As @Ismael-VC pointed out in the user group, it works in parallel with
    julia> @parallel for i in collect(enumerate(list))
                      println(i)
           end
But it seems a bit confusing to me that the behaviour of `enumerate()` changes
depending on whether the loop is run in parallel or not.
