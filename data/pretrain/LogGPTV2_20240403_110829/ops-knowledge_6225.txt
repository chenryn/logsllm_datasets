To effectively implement CIS Control 16.13, which focuses on conducting application penetration testing, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Identify Critical Applications**: Begin by identifying the applications that are most critical to your business operations and those that handle sensitive data. These applications should be prioritized for penetration testing.

2. **Plan the Penetration Test**: Develop a detailed plan for the penetration test, including the scope, objectives, and methodologies to be used. Ensure that the plan includes both authenticated and unauthenticated testing scenarios to cover a wide range of potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Authenticated Penetration Testing**: For critical applications, conduct authenticated penetration testing. This approach is more effective in identifying business logic vulnerabilities compared to code scanning and automated security testing. Authenticated testing allows the tester to simulate the actions of a legitimate user with various levels of access, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the application's security.

4. **Engage Skilled Testers**: Utilize skilled and experienced penetration testers who can manually manipulate the application to uncover vulnerabilities. The skill of the tester is crucial in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated tools.

5. **Document Findings and Recommendations**: Thoroughly document all findings from the penetration test, including identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended remediation steps. This documentation should be shared with relevant stakeholders, such as the development and security teams, to facilitate the remediation process.

6. **Implement Remediation Measures**: Based on the findings, implement the necessary remediation measures to address the identified vulnerabilities. This may involve code changes, configuration updates, or other security enhancements.

7. **Re-test and Validate**: After implementing the remediation measures, re-test the application to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed. This step is crucial to validate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts and to ensure that the application is secure.

8. **Regular Testing and Continuous Improvement**: Conduct regular penetration tests to ensure that the application remains secure over time. Continuously improve the testing process based on new threats and evolving best practices.

CIS Control 16.13 specifically targets the asset type "Applications" and falls under the security function "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can enhance the security of their critical applications and reduce the risk of security breaches.
