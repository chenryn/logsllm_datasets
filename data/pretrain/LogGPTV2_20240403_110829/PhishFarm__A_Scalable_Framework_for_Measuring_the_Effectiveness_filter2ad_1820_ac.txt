loads. During our experiments, we used three types of nodes:
Mac OS X 10.12 VMs with Chrome, Safari, Opera, and
Firefox; Windows 10 VMs with Edge and Internet Explorer
(IE) 11; and Windows 8.1 VMs with IE 11. In total, the
full experiments required 31 desktop nodes across four host
machines (collectively with 18 Intel Core i7 CPU cores and
96 Gb of RAM) to deliver the required level of monitoring
performance and redundancy. Each node informs the API of
the browsers it supports; it then awaits a command consisting
of a set of URLs for a target browser, and in real time, reports
the monitoring results back to the API. We freshly installed
the latest stable version of each browser at the time of each
test and kept default security settings (or, in the case of IE
and Edge, recommended settings when prompted).
We were unable to obtain such a large number of mobile
devices, and ofﬁcial emulators at the time would force-disable
blacklist warnings. Thus, we only tested mobile browsers
hourly and relied on our observation that their behavior was
tied to the behavior their desktop counterparts. We used a
physical Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel phone to
test mobile Chrome, Firefox, and Opera; and an iPhone 7
(preliminary) or 8 (full) to test mobile Safari. A future version
of the framework could be improved to leverage Android VMs,
in lieu of physical or emulated devices, to perform monitoring
similar to that of desktop browsers.

Lastly, we wanted to ensure that the large number of re-
quests from our monitoring system did not affect the blacklist
status of our phishing sites (i.e. by triggering heuristics or
network-level analysis [6]). Therefore, rather than displaying
the phishing content in the monitoring system’s browsers, we
simply displayed a blank page with a 200 status code. While
we had the option of querying the GSB API directly as a
supplement to empirically monitoring the browsers it protects,
we chose not
to do so for the same reason. Finally, our
monitors used an anonymous VPN service (NordVPN) in an
effort to bypass any institution- and ISP-level snifﬁng.
D. Ethical and Security Concerns
Over the course of our experiments, we were careful in
ensuring that no actual users would visit (let alone submit
credentials to) our phishing sites: we only ever shared the site
URLs directly with anti-phishing entities, and we sterilized
the login forms such that passwords would not be transmitted
in the event of form submission. In the hands of malicious
actors with access to the necessary hosting and message
distribution infrastructure, and with malicious modiﬁcations,
our framework could potentially be used to carry out real and
evasive phishing attacks on a large scale. We will thus not
release the framework as open source software; however, we
will share it privately with vetted security researchers.
Another potential concern is that testing such as ours could
degrade the response time of live anti-phishing systems or
negatively impact data samples used by their classiﬁers. Given
the volume of live phishing attacks today [2], we do not
believe that our experiments carried any adverse side-effects;
the entities to which we disclosed did not raise any concerns
regarding this. With respect to classiﬁers based on machine
learning, effective methodology has already been proposed to
ensure that high-frequency phishing sites do not skew training
samples [20]. Nevertheless, it would be prudent for any party
engaged in long-term or high-volume testing of this nature to
ﬁrst consult with any targeted entities.
V. EVALUATION
PhishFarm proved to deliver reliable performance over the
course of our tests and executed our experimental methodology
as designed. Following the completion of all tests, we had
collected timestamps of when blacklisting occurred, relative
to the time we reported the site, for each of our phishing
sites in each of the desktop and mobile browsers tested. This
totaled over 20,000 data points across the preliminary and
full tests, and had added dimensionality due to the various
entities and cloaking techniques tested. Table V shows the
breakdown of crawler and blacklisting activity on our phishing
sites. Overall, we found that sites with cloaking were both
slower and less likely to be blacklisted than sites without
cloaking: in the full tests, just 23.0% of our sites with cloaking
(which were crawled) ended up being blacklisted in at least
one browser— far fewer than the 49.4% sites without cloaking
which were blacklisted. Cloaking also slowed the average time
to blacklisting from 126 minutes (for sites without cloaking)
to 238 minutes.
However, closer scrutiny is required to make insightful
conclusions about
the conditions under which cloaking is
effective, as we found that each anti-phishing entity exhib-
ited distinctive blacklisting of different cloaking techniques
alongside varying overall speed. For example, the mobile-only
Filter B showed 100% effectiveness against blacklisting across
all entities. On the other hand, the JavaScript-based Filter F
was 100% effective for some entities, delayed blacklisting
for others, but was in fact more likely to be blacklisted
than Filter A by others still. In many cases, there was also
a lack of blacklisting of Filter A sites (i.e. those without
cloaking). Entities— in particular,
the clearinghouses— at
times failed to ultimately blacklist a reported site despite
extensive crawling activity. Although it is possible that our
direct reporting methodology led to some sites being ignored
altogether, the exceptional performance of GSB with respect
to Filter A shows that a very high standard is realistic. We
detail each entity’s behavior in Section V-F.
To provide meaningful measurements of entity performance
with respect to different browsers and cloaking ﬁlters, we
propose a scoring system in Section V-B which seeks to
capture both the response time and number of sites blacklisted
by each anti-phishing entity for each browser and/or ﬁlter. In
addition, we summarize our ﬁndings visually in Figures 2 and
3 by plotting the cumulative percentage of sites blacklisted
over time, segmented by each browser or by each cloaking
technique, respectively. Lastly, we analyze web trafﬁc logs to
make observations about the distinctive behavior of each anti-
phishing entity. Although much of our analysis focuses on the
results of the large-scale full tests, we also make comparisons
to the preliminary test data when appropriate.
A. Crawling Behavior
Of all sites that we launched during the preliminary and full
tests, most (81.9%) saw requests from a web crawler, and a
majority of sites therein (66.0%) was successfully retrieved at
least once (i.e. bypassing cloaking if in use). In a handful of
cases, our reports were ignored by the entities and thus resulted
in no crawling activity, possibly due to volume or similarity
