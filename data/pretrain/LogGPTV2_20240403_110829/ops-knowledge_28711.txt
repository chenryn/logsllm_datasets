### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 2008-11-10 19:35:51 to 2008-11-10 21:01:27, contains 20 lines of system logs. Each line includes a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and log content. The logs can be categorized into two main activities:

1. **DataNode Block Serving:**
   - **Successful Block Serving (INFO):**
     - At 19:35:51, DataNode with PID 14191 served block `blk_6552418180158772377` to IP `10.251.39.242`.
     - At 19:45:44, DataNode with PID 14270 served block `blk_-1442905060580014339` to IP `10.251.202.209`.
     - At 19:55:00, DataNode with PID 14389 served block `blk_798664047382151445` to IP `10.251.39.179`.
     - At 20:03:11, DataNode with PID 14622 served block `blk_8591104451552720112` to IP `10.250.11.194`.

   - **Failed Block Serving (WARN):**
     - At 19:41:59, DataNode with PID 14349 encountered an exception while serving block `blk_-3572295706132449090` to IP `10.251.111.130`.
     - At 19:47:35, DataNode with PID 14044 encountered an exception while serving block `blk_7760079751081658559` to IP `10.251.215.70`.

2. **FSNamesystem Block Deletion:**
   - From 21:01:12 to 21:01:27, the FSNamesystem with PID 28 added several blocks to the `invalidSet` for various IP addresses. The blocks added to the `invalidSet` are:
     - `blk_-531469051872229488` for IP `10.251.71.146`.
     - `blk_-4657423175636611807` for IP `10.251.193.175`.
     - `blk_-6117917602803602155` for IP `10.251.67.211`.
     - `blk_-7584542530081657301` for IP `10.250.10.223`.
     - `blk_4640277741339926850` for IP `10.251.26.131`.
     - `blk_-7285565997486715015` for IP `10.250.6.191`.
     - `blk_3652427357251545055` for IP `10.250.10.223`.
     - `blk_5163387277374142808` for IP `10.251.71.193`.
     - `blk_-1342669964196815853` for IP `10.250.17.225`.
     - `blk_-424018194735922479` for IP `10.251.42.84`.
     - `blk_-3754029959138975487` for IP `10.251.214.112`.
     - `blk_-4149539113118855204` for IP `10.251.71.16`.
     - `blk_5868517220927475394` for IP `10.251.67.113`.
     - `blk_6093858391888371854` for IP `10.251.42.207`.

### Key Observations
- The DataNode successfully served blocks to multiple IP addresses but also encountered exceptions in some cases.
- The FSNamesystem marked a significant number of blocks as invalid and added them to the `invalidSet` for specific IP addresses.

This summary provides a clear and structured overview of the log activities, highlighting both successful and failed operations, and the actions taken by the FSNamesystem.
