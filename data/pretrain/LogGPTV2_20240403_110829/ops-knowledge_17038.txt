 "B": "Conditional access policies allow for more granular control, preventing lockouts from legitimate users while still deterring attackers."
 "C": "Strict account lockout policies are more user-friendly as they simplify the login process for users by removing additional security checks."
 "D": "Implementing strict account lockout policies is less resource-intensive compared to the continuous monitoring required by conditional access policies."
