deployment of WiMax clients and base stations. These 
traces  were  collected  while  driving  around  at  various 
speeds  within  the  coverage  areas.  In  each  trace, 
measurements of downlink CINR were recorded  every 
one  second.  (Due  to  early  implementation  limitation, 
the  measurements  could  not  be  taken  at  a  higher 
frequency.)  We  extracted  5  traces  that  altogether  span 
for  4  hours  and  27  minutes,  and  applied  our  trigger 
prediction  algorithm  to  these  traces.  Figure  12  shows 
two  of  the  traces.  In  WiMax  networks,  connection 
failures  are  likely  to  occur  when  CINR  values  are 
below 0, and 9 was used to trigger a handoff process in 
these experiments. Hence, for the WiMax traces, we set 
LGD_TH to 9, and LD_TH to 0.

On  the  other  hand,  the  results  show  one  canceled 
PreTrigger  and  6  missed  predictions.  We  conjecture 
that the higher percentage of missed prediction in these 
WiMax  traces  than  those  in  WiFi  traces  is  due  to  the 
various  driving  speeds  in  collecting  WiMax  traces.  In 
the  current  design  of  our  algorithms,  we  used  fixed 
sizes of history windows. One enhancement is to apply 
adaptive  window  sizes  to  adapt  to  different  moving 
speed,  which  would  be  part  of  our  future  work.  Also, 
higher frequency of CINR measurements might help. 
5.  Prototype 
Intel  and  BT  have  collaborated  to  prototype  a 
WiFi/WiMax  multi-radio  system  in  the  BT  21CN 
environment  [3].  Figure  14  shows  the  high  level 
architecture  of  the  prototype  at  the  client  side,  which 
we refer as the MxN architecture. Applications can use 
the  services  provided  by  the  MxN  system  through  the 
MxN  interface.  These  services  include  802.21  MIH 
services, connection management and network  adaptor 
management. Applications such as VPN and SIP-based 
applications  that  are  not  capable  of  switching  across 
4 For WiMax results, we do not report the length of the proactive 
window  as  in  seconds.  The  reason  is  that  CINR  values  were 
collected  every  1  second.  This  frequency  will  not  reflect  future 
implementations,  where  CINR  measurements  will  be  collect  more 
frequently.  With  more  frequent  samples,  we  conjecture  that  the 
absolute  time  span  of  a  proactive  window  may  be  smaller,  but  the 
length in terms of average number of steps might be similar.  
For  the  function  blocks  inside  the  MxN  system,  the 
Smart  Triggers  block  addresses  the  “when  and  why” 
step  in  a  handover,  and  provides  the  mechanism  to 
monitor changes to MAC and PHY state, including link 
triggers.  The  Information  Exchange  block  interfaces 
with  Information  Server  (in  the  networks),  retrieve 
network  information,  and  provide  it  to  the  Network 
Selection engine, which then chooses the best network 
to operate on. Together these two address the “where” 
step.  Finally,  the  Network  Switching  module  work 
closely with SIP to address the “how” step.

We have integrated our smart triggering scheme into 
the  Smart  Triggers  block 
the  prototype.  For 
evaluation  purpose,  we  had  a  heterogeneous  wireless 
environment  setup  in  our  lab,  which  includes  a  WiFi 
Access  Point  and  a  WiMax  Base  Station.  The 
WiFi/WiMax  prototype  system  is  equipped  with  a 
WiFi  card  and  a  WiMax  card.  We  conducted  a  set  of 
experiments  similar  to  those  described  in  Figure  1  to 
study  the  benefits  of  smart  triggering.  Fading  of  WiFi 
signal  strength  was  emulated  by  tuning  an  attenuator 
attached to the WiFi AP. Moreover, in our experiments, 
we set LGD_TH to be -60 and LD_TH to be -65.5

a vertical handover with smart triggering integrated. In

5 The  purpose  that  we  chose  -60  as  LGD_TH  is  to  maintain  the 
MOS score, a score indicating VoIP quality, to stay above 3.0 during 
handovers in our lab setup. In real deployment, this threshold could 
be  lower.  We  are  currently  investigating  appropriate  values  for  the 
thresholds for VoIP applications in real deployment.

The  Connection  Manager  runs  the  network  selection 
logic,  selects  WiMax  as 
the  new  network  and 
establishes  connection  to  it.  Note  that  during  this 
process  the  system  is  still  connected  to  the  WiFi 
network  and  the  SIP  application  continued  streaming 
audio.  Once  the  connection  to  the  WiMax  network  is 
complete and the audio session has been transferred to 
the  WiMax  interface,  the  connection  to  the  WLAN 
network  is  then  torn  down.  Of  the  11  experiments  we 
did, our triggering scheme predicted the LGD events in 
10 of the experiments, and on average predictions were 
made  1.02  seconds  ahead  of  time.  On  the  other  hand, 
our measurements show that  the  total  time  for  WiMax 
connection 
IP  address 
acquisition, binding update and media redirection, was 
3.6 seconds. Altogether, with the smart trigger scheme, 
the  audio  session  handover  delay  was  reduced  to 
305ms (in contrast to more than 9 seconds in Figure 1). 
The  delay  of  305ms  is  mainly  due  to  implementation 
limitations 
in  media 
redirection.  We  expect  that  with  improvements  in  the 
implementation,  the  handover  delay  could  be  reduced 
to less than 150ms.

6. Conclusion 
For  multi-radio  devices  that  expect  ubiquitous 
connectivity across networks, vertical handovers could 
be lengthy (multiple seconds) since it typically involves 
a  combination  of  link  layer,  IP  layer,  and  application 
layer  executions.  Hence  the  ability  to  detect  and  react 
rapidly  to  link  changes  affects  the  performance  of 
network  applications 
in  selecting  an  appropriate 
network  and  providing  seamless  connectivity.  In  this 
paper, we proposed a novel smart triggering scheme to 
predict  when  a  device  needs  to  take  proactive  actions 
and  prepare  for  handovers.  With  our  smart  triggering, 
events  such  as  LGD  could  be  predicted  more  than  1 
second  ahead  of  time.  Our  scheme  not  only  enables  a 
Connection Manger to detect LGD before connection is 
lost 
for 
confirmation), but also provides it extra time to turn on 
another radio, obtain IP address, and redirect a session. 
(instead  of  waiting 
for  OS  messages 
Finally, by integrating the smart triggering scheme into 
our  WiFi/WiMax  multi-radio  prototype  and  running 
experiments  in  heterogeneous  wireless  networks,  we 
show that handover delays at the application level were 
significantly 
to 
milliseconds.
