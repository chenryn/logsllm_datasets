In this revision, I have:

1. Added a clear and consistent format for the ATT&CK ID and Technique Name.
2. Replaced "has shown" with "has revealed" for a more formal tone.
3. Changed "regularly undergoes" to "frequently undergoes" to emphasize the ongoing nature of the improvements.
4. Replaced "technical improvements" with "technical enhancements" for a more precise and professional term.
