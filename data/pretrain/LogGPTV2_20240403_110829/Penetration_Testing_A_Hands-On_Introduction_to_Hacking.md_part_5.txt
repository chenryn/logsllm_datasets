### Chapter 1: Setting Up Your Virtual Lab

#### 6. Initial Screen
You will be presented with a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 1-5.
**Figure 1-5: The Kali Linux GUI**

#### Configuring the Network for Your Virtual Machine
Since we will be using Kali Linux to attack target systems over a network, all our virtual machines must be on the same virtual network. VMware offers three options for virtual network connections: Bridged, NAT, and Host-Only. It is recommended to use the Bridged option. Here’s a brief overview of each:

- **Bridged Network**: This option connects the virtual machine directly to the local network using the same connection as the host system. On the local network, the virtual machine appears as another node with its own IP address.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: This sets up a private network on the host machine. Outgoing traffic from the virtual machine is translated to the local network, and incoming traffic appears to come from the host machine’s IP address.
- **Host-Only Network**: This limits the virtual machine to a local private network on the host. The virtual machine can communicate with other virtual machines and the host but not with the local network or the Internet.

**Note**: Since our target virtual machines will have multiple known security vulnerabilities, exercise caution when connecting them to your local network. Other users on the network could also attack these machines. Therefore, it is not recommended to work through this book on a public network where you do not trust the other users.

By default, the Kali Linux virtual machine network adapter is set to NAT. Here’s how to change that to Bridged on both Windows and Mac OS.

#### VMware Player on Microsoft Windows
1. Start VMware Player and select your Kali Linux virtual machine.
2. Choose "Edit virtual machine settings," as shown in Figure 1-6. (If Kali Linux is running, choose "Player > Manage > Virtual machine settings.")
   **Figure 1-6: Changing the VMware network adapter**
3. In the next screen, select "Network Adapter" in the Hardware tab and choose the "Bridged" option in the Network connection section, as shown in Figure 1-7.
   **Figure 1-7: Changing the network adapter settings**
4. Click the "Configure Adapters" button and select the network adapter used by your host operating system. For example, I selected the Realtek wireless adapter. Press OK once done.
   **Figure 1-8: Selecting a network adapter**

#### VMware Fusion on Mac OS
1. Go to "Virtual Machine > Network Adapter" and change the setting from NAT to Bridged, as shown in Figure 1-9.
   **Figure 1-9: Changing the network adapter**

#### Connecting the Virtual Machine to the Network
Kali Linux should automatically obtain an IP address from the Bridged network once the switch is made. To verify your IP address, open a Linux terminal by clicking the terminal icon (a black rectangle with the symbols `>_` at the top left of the Kali screen) or by choosing "Applications > Accessories > Terminal." Then run the command `ifconfig` to see your network information, as shown in Listing 1-1.

```bash
root@kali:~# ifconfig
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:0c:29:df:7e:4d
inet addr:192.168.20.9 Bcast:192.168.20.255 Mask:255.255.255.0
inet6 addr: fe80::20c:29ff:fedf:7e4d/64 Scope:Link
--snip--
```
**Listing 1-1: Networking information**

The IPv4 address for this virtual machine is 192.168.20.9, as highlighted in bold in Listing 1-1. (Your IP address may differ.)

#### Testing Your Internet Access
To ensure Kali Linux can connect to the Internet, use the `ping` network utility to check connectivity to Google. Ensure your computer is connected to the Internet, open a Linux terminal, and enter the following command:

```bash
root@kali:~# ping www.google.com
```

If you receive a response like the following, you are online:

```bash
PING www.google.com (50.0.2.221) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from cache.google.com (50.0.2.221): icmp_req=1 ttl=60 time=28.7 ms
64 bytes from cache.google.com (50.0.2.221): icmp_req=2 ttl=60 time=28.1 ms
64 bytes from cache.google.com (50.0.2.221): icmp_req=3 ttl=60 time=27.4 ms
64 bytes from cache.google.com (50.0.2.221): icmp_req=4 ttl=60 time=29.4 ms
64 bytes from cache.google.com (50.0.2.221): icmp_req=5 ttl=60 time=28.7 ms
64 bytes from cache.google.com (50.0.2.221): icmp_req=6 ttl=60 time=28.0 ms
--snip--
```

If you do not receive a response, ensure that:
- The network adapter is set to Bridged.
- Kali Linux has an IP address.
- Your host system has Internet access.

#### Installing Nessus
Although Kali Linux includes many tools, we need to install a few additional programs. First, we’ll install Tenable Security’s Nessus Home vulnerability scanner, which is free for home use only.

**Note**: Nessus is actively developed, so the current version and its GUI may have changed since this book was published.

Follow these steps to install Nessus Home:

1. Open "Applications > Internet > Iceweasel Web Browser" and enter `http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home/` in the address bar. Complete the registration for an activation code and click Register (use a real email address).
2. On the Downloads page, choose the latest version of Nessus for the Linux Debian 32-bit platform (e.g., Nessus-5.2.5-debian6_i386.deb) and download it to your root directory.
3. Open a Linux terminal and enter `ls` to list the files in your root directory. You should see the Nessus file you downloaded.
4. Enter `dpkg -i` followed by the name of the downloaded file (use tab completion for ease) and press Enter to begin the installation process. Installation may take some time as Nessus processes various plugins.

```bash
Selecting previously unselected package nessus.
(Reading database ... 355024 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking nessus (from Nessus-5.2.5-debian6_amd64.deb) ...
Setting up nessus (5.2.5) ...
nessusd (Nessus) 5.2.5 [build N25109] for Linux
Copyright (C) 1998 - 2014 Tenable Network Security, Inc
Processing the Nessus plugins...
[########### ]
```

5. Once returned to the root prompt with no errors, Nessus should be installed, and you should see a message indicating that all plugins are loaded.
6. Start Nessus with the following command:

```bash
root@kali:~# /etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

7. Open the URL `https://kali:8834/` in the Iceweasel web browser. You should see an SSL certificate warning, as shown in Figure 1-10.
   **Figure 1-10: Invalid SSL certificate warning**
8. Expand "I Understand the Risks" and click "Add Exception." Then click "Confirm Security Exception," as shown in Figure 1-11.
   **Figure 1-11: Confirming the security exception**
9. Click "Get Started" at the bottom left of the opening Nessus page and enter a username and password. For example, I chose `georgia:password`. Remember this for later use.
10. On the next page, enter the activation code you received via email from Tenable Security.
11. Choose to download plugins (this may take some time). Once Nessus processes the plugins, it will initialize.
12. When Nessus finishes downloading and configuring, you should see the Nessus login screen, as shown in Figure 1-12. Use the credentials created during setup to log in.
   **Figure 1-12: Login screen of the Nessus web interface**

To close Nessus, simply close its tab in the browser. We will return to Nessus in Chapter 6.

#### Installing Additional Software
We still need to install a few more tools to complete your Kali Linux setup.

##### The Ming C Compiler
Install the Ming compiler to compile C code for Microsoft Windows systems. The Ming compiler is included in the Kali Linux repositories but is not installed by default. Install it with the following command:

```bash
root@kali:~# apt-get install mingw32
```

##### Hyperion
Hyperion is an encryption program used to bypass antivirus software. It is not included in the Kali repositories. Download, unzip, and compile it with the Ming cross compiler, as shown in Listing 1-2.

```bash
root@kali:~# wget http://nullsecurity.net/tools/binary/Hyperion-1.0.zip
root@kali:~# unzip Hyperion-1.0.zip
Archive: Hyperion-1.0.zip
creating: Hyperion-1.0/

root@kali:~# i586-mingw32msvc-c++ Hyperion-1.0/Src/Crypter/*.cpp -o hyperion.exe
--snip--
```
**Listing 1-2: Installing Hyperion**

##### Veil-Evasion
Veil-Evasion generates payload executables to bypass common antivirus solutions. Install it with the following commands, as shown in Listing 1-3.

```bash
root@kali:~# wget https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/Veil/archive/master.zip

##### Ettercap
Ettercap is a tool for performing man-in-the-middle attacks. Before running it for the first time, make the following changes to its configuration file at `/etc/ettercap/etter.conf`:

1. Open the configuration file in the nano editor:

```bash
root@kali:~# nano /etc/ettercap/etter.conf
```

2. Change the `userid` and `groupid` values to 0 to allow Ettercap to run with root privileges. Scroll down to the following lines and replace the values with 0:

```plaintext
[privs]
ec_uid = 0 # nobody is the default
ec_gid = 0 # nobody is the default
```

3. Uncomment the two lines in the Linux section to set Iptables firewall rules to redirect traffic:

```plaintext
#---------------
# Linux
#---------------
# if you use ipchains:
#redir_command_on = "ipchains -A input -i %iface -p tcp -s 0/0 -d 0/0 %port -j REDIRECT %rport"
#redir_command_off = "ipchains -D input -i %iface -p tcp -s 0/0 -d 0/0 %port -j REDIRECT %rport"
# if you use iptables:
uredir_command_on = "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"
vredir_command_off = "iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i %iface -p tcp --dport %port -j REDIRECT --to-port %rport"
```

4. Save and exit the file by pressing `Ctrl-X`, then `Y` to save the changes.

#### Setting Up Android Emulators
We will now set up three Android emulators on Kali for mobile testing in Chapter 20. First, download the Android SDK.

1. Open the Iceweasel web browser from within Kali and visit `https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html`.
2. Download the current version of the ADT bundle for 32-bit Linux and save it to your root directory.
3. Open a terminal, list the files there (`ls`), and extract the compressed archive with `unzip`:

```bash
root@kali:~# unzip adt-bundle-Linux-x86-xxxxxxxxxxx.zip
```

4. Navigate to the new directory and start the Android SDK Manager:

```bash
cd adt-bundle-linux-x86-xxxxxxxxxxx/sdk/tools
./android
```

5. The Android SDK Manager should open, as shown in Figure 1-13.
   **Figure 1-13: The Android SDK Manager**
6. Download any updates to the Android SDK tools and Android SDK platform tools (checked by default), as well as Android 4.3, Android 2.2, and Android 2.1. Select the boxes to the left of each Android version. Then click "Install packages," as shown in Figure 1-14. Accept the license agreement, and the Android SDK will download and install the chosen packages. Installation may take several minutes.
   **Figure 1-14: Installing Android software**

Now, set up the Android virtual devices. Open the Android SDK Manager and choose "Tools > Manage AVDs." You should see the window shown in Figure 1-15.
