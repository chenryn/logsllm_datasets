First of all, let me say sorry for the fact that this issue will most probably
not comply with the issue reporting guidelines. This is due to the fact that I
am not a developer using electron but just a user using electron apps, in
particular Franz (http://meetfranz.com) and Skype (the new electron version of
it). Since the issue I want to report appeared in both apps, I assume that it
is an issue of electron itself, but if I am wrong here, let me know.
The issue is of rather cosmetic nature: The text color in the menu bar seems
to be hard coded to white when not hovered and black when hovered. This leads
to the problem that in dark themes the text becomes hard to read when hovered
and on light themes when not hovered. Here are some screenshots demonstrating
the issue in Skype:

  * Electron version: Unknown, I'm using binary packages of Franz and Skype.
  * Operating system: Manjaro Linux
### Expected behavior
The text color in the menu bar should follow the theme settings like in native
(GTK) applications
### Actual behavior
The text color is hard to read if hovered on dark themes or not hovered on
light themes
### How to reproduce
Use Skype or Franz on Linux with light or dark GTK themes.
