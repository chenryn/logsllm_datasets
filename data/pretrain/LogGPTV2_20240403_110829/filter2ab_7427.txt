### Title: Physical Attacks on Smartphones: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Modern Android Devices

#### Abstract:
Despite continuous improvements in security, modern Android devices remain vulnerable to physical attacks. This presentation aims to highlight and demonstrate exploitable vulnerabilities in contemporary Android smartphones, even with the latest mitigations in place.

#### Phase 1: Analysis and Exploitation of Vendor-Customized Recovery Modes
In this phase, we will delve into the analysis and exploitation of vendor-customized versions of Android's Recovery mode. Specifically, we will identify and demonstrate weaknesses that allow for privilege escalation to root access. Additionally, we will show how an attacker can traverse from the Recovery mode to the Android operating system without needing access to the Bootloader.

#### Phase 2: Weaknesses in the Secondary Bootloader
In the second phase, we will examine vulnerabilities in the Secondary Bootloader of devices produced by a popular smartphone manufacturer. We will present a detailed case study where a flaw in the core USB stack is exploited to achieve code execution. Furthermore, we will demonstrate how a modified Android image can be booted, all while maintaining the device's functionality.

By the end of this talk, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the current state of physical security in Android devices and the potential risks associated with these vulnerabilities.
