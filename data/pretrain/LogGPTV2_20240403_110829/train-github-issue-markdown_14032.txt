I'm getting the following error:
`Uncaught SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "http://localhost:8080"
from accessing a frame with origin "https://w.soundcloud.com". The frame
requesting access has a protocol of "http", the frame being accessed has a
protocol of "https". Protocols must match.`
I have a simple app that can display a list of sound cloud players.
Steps to reproduce:
Clone my repo `https://github.com/samu/vue-playground`, then `npm install &&
npm run dev`
In the browser you'll see a bunch of buttons labeled with `x`: Click the very
last one and the exception will be thrown.
