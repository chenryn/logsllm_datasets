User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to deal with resistant malware Everytime I visit Gmail, Facebook, YouTube, or Yahoo mail, I get a popup "Please update Internet Explorer" (while I'm using Chrome!). I don't have screenshots but this website describes the problem.

I followed all steps but it had no impact. I also ran a few virus scans using Kaspersky, then uninstalled Chrome and Firefox and re-installed them, but the virus persisted. 

I took a backup of all my data and formatted the entire hard drive - including non-system partitions - and re-installed Windows 7 with all the required drivers. I used Internet Explorer but the problem persisted. I have a Kaspersky firewall and antivirus, and MalwareBytes, but neither can detect any malware.

I reformatted and re-installed again, to no avail: the problem is still there. I have no idea what to do. My computer technician basically tried the same things, but he couldn't fix it either.

I'm really stuck and don't know how to proceed.

Assistant: ok so with the actions you've taken on your local PC it sounds like you've eliminated that as the problem (malware usually can't survive a full reformat/reinstall of windows).  So the next candidate would be your home router.

From this link you can see an example of malware which operates by changing the DNS settings on your router which would then essentially allow an attacker to inject content into your browsing sessions.

So what I'd recommend as a next step would be log into your router and look at the DNS server settings.  You'll want to set them either to ones that your ISP provides or alternatively something like Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or OpenDNS (208.67.222.222).

Can't guarantee that that'll solve the problem but it's likely not a bad next step!
