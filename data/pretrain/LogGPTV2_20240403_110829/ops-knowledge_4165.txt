User: How to create a custom Docker image?
Assistant: To create a custom Docker image, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Write a Dockerfile to specify the base image, software package, configuration file, run command, and so on. Two packages can be used with multiple RUN instructions and, if desired, local files can be copied into the container using COPY or ADD instructions. 2. Run the docker build command in the directory where the Dockerfile is located to generate the image. For example: ``` docker build -t myimage:v1 . ``` Among them, the -t parameter is used to specify the image name and version number, and . indicates the directory where the Dockerfile is located. 3. The build process will automatically build the image according to the instructions in the Dockerfile, which usually takes a few minutes. After the build is complete, use docker images to view all images and confirm that the custom image has been successfully built.
