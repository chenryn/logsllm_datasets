### ATT&CK Technique: User Account Control (ID: M1052)

#### Configuration for Standard Users

To configure User Account Control (UAC) settings for standard users, you can modify the following registry keys:

1. **Automatically Deny Elevation Requests**:
   - Navigate to the registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`.
   - Add or modify the DWORD value `ConsentPromptBehaviorUser` and set it to `0x00000000`. This setting will automatically deny elevation requests for standard users.

2. **Enable Installer Detection**:
   - To enable installer detection for all users, add or modify the DWORD value `EnableInstallerDetection` and set it to `0x00000001`. This will prompt for a password during the installation process and log the attempt.
   - To disable installer detection, set the `EnableInstallerDetection` value to `0x00000000`. Disabling this feature may prevent potential privilege escalation through exploitation during the UAC detection of installers, but it will allow the installation process to continue without logging.

By configuring these settings, you can control how UAC handles elevation requests and installer detection, thereby enhancing the security of your system.
