    import pandas as pd

    frame = pd.read_csv("table.csv", engine="python", parse_dates=['since'])
    print frame
    d = pd.pivot_table(frame, index=pd.TimeGrouper(key='since', freq='1d'), values=["value"], columns=['id'], aggfunc=np.sum, fill_value=0)

    frame = pd.read_csv("table2.csv", engine="python", parse_dates=['since'])  # add some values to a day
    print frame
    d = pd.pivot_table(frame, index=pd.TimeGrouper(key='since', freq='1d'), values=["value"], columns=['id'], aggfunc=np.sum, fill_value=0)
    print d
The following data is the contents of `table.csv`
    "id","since","value"
    "81","2015-01-31 07:00:00+00:00","2200.0000"
    "81","2015-02-01 07:00:00+00:00","2200.0000"
This is `table2.csv`:
    "id","since","value"
    "81","2015-01-31 07:00:00+00:00","2200.0000"
    "81","2015-01-31 08:00:00+00:00","2200.0000"
    "81","2015-01-31 09:00:00+00:00","2200.0000"
    "81","2015-02-01 07:00:00+00:00","2200.0000"
The output of print after pivoting `table.csv`
                                                                    id  value
      81   2200
    id                                                              81   2200
I would expect something like this:
                value
    id             81
    since            
    2015-01-31   2200
    2015-02-01   2200
I can trace the problem to here:
https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/62529cca28e9c8652ddf7cca3aa6d41d4e30bc0e/pandas/tools/pivot.py#L114
the index created by groupby already has the object there.
I can't figure anything else. What is the problem, any fixes?
Thanks.
