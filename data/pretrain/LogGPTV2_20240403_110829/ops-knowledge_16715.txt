User: I installed python using MacPort and I am satisfied with the result, but found that there are other versions of Python installed in other directories, and can not remember how they were instaldas, it's been five years that use this notebook and perhaps installed by other means a few years.
I tried to remove all references to extra Python, beyond that were installed with MacPorts, but do not think like, I tried to remove the directories with the command rm -rfmas even using sudo rm -rf have success.
The old instalation are in directories:

/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/
/Library/Python/

How to discover the origin of such facilities and remove permanently?
Assistant: Don't remove the system Pythons. They may be used by other programs. (I don't know if anything on OS X actually uses them, but it's best to keep them.)
Instead, just make sure that your MacPorts bin directory (at /opt/local/bin) is first on your $PATH.
