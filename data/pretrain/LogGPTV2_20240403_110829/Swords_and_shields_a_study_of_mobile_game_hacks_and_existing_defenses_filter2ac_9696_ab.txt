development platforms such as Unity3D (C#) [33], Android
SDK (Java) [18] and NDK (C++) [17], Adobe Air (Action-
Script) [1], and cocos2d-x (C++) [10]. Android SDK/NDK,
Unity3D, and cocos2d-x are three leading development plat-
forms. The other platforms have fewer than 10 applications
in our game set. This set of games also cover most game gen-
res such as action, strategy, and sports [2]. The game devel-
opers range from big companies (e.g., King Digital, Zygna,
and Tencent to individual developers.
In addition, these
games exhibit diversiﬁed network access patterns.
4.2 Summary of Results
Most mobile games expose two types of resources to hack-
ers:
local resources (e.g., memory and local ﬁles) and net-
work traﬃc. Accordingly, developers try to protect these
resources using various mechanisms. To protect against
malicious modiﬁcations of local resources, developers adopt
memory protections and ﬁle protections. To protect network
traﬃc against modiﬁcation and injection, techniques such as
encoding, encryption and signing are applied to the commu-
nication between the mobile device and the game server.
We also observed developers adopting diﬀerent approaches
to protect the logic of their games, such as applying code
obfuscation and compiling critical components into native
code. These mechanisms try to discourage hackers from un-
derstanding how the games behave internally. In addition,
some developers implement mechanisms for synchronizing
client-side state with servers. Such client-server synchro-
nization ensures that malicious modiﬁcation of the client-
side state cannot persist, instead reverting back to the server-
side value during subsequent synchronization.
In the following sections, we explain the aforementioned
mechanisms:
local resource protection, network protection,
code obfuscation, native code implementation, and client-
server sync.
