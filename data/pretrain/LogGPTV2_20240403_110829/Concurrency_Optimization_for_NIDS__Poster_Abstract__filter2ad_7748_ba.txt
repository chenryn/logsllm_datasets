### Homeostasis and B0AT1 (SLC6A19) in Amino Acid Absorption

B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is the primary neutral amino acid transporter in the intestinal lumen, responsible for the majority of dietary amino acid absorption. Additionally, it reabsorbs neutral amino acids in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Mice lacking B0AT1 exhibit signs of protein restriction, such as elevated levels of FGF21 and reduced mTORC1 activity. These mice also show improved glucose homeostasis and are protected from diet-induced obesity, making B0AT1 a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases like phenylketonuria and type 2 diabetes.

To investigate the postprandial levels of amino acids and other metabolites, we conducted a study using SLC6A19 knockout (SLC6A19ko), wild-type (WT), and heterozygous (hz) mice fed low, standard, and high protein diets. In WT mice, all essential amino acids showed a significant positive correlation with the protein content of the diet. The neutral amino acids that require SLC6A19 for absorption were significantly reduced in the blood of SLC6A19ko mice, while other amino acids showed no significant difference compared to WT mice. This reduction was more pronounced under conditions of a high-protein diet. We also identified several bacterial metabolites of amino acid fermentation in the blood of SLC6A19ko mice, which correlated with the protein content of the diet.

This study highlights the potential of targeting B0AT1 to induce protein restriction, thereby offering a new approach for treating metabolic disorders.

### P-190: A Reliable Mass Spectrometry Methodology for Podocyturia Evaluation in Genetic and Non-Genetic Kidney Diseases

**Presenting Author:** Christiane Auray-Blais, Université de Sherbrooke, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Tristan Martineau, Michel Boutin, Anne-Marie-Côté, Bruno Maranda, Daniel Bichet

Increased podocyte levels in urine (podocyturia) are an early sign of kidney abnormalities. Current methods for evaluating kidney damage, such as proteinuria measurements and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), may not always be efficient for early detection. Moreover, existing analytical techniques for podocyturia evaluation are often tedious, time-consuming, and can lead to significant variability in results.

The primary objective of this research project was to develop and validate a multiplex, quantitative ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method to evaluate two proteins related to podocyturia, podocalyxin and podocin, in urine samples. The secondary aim was to analyze these biomarkers in samples from women with preeclampsia, Fabry disease patients, and gender-matched controls.

One milliliter of a random urine sample was centrifuged, and cleavable peptide standards were added to the supernatant. Trypsin digestion was performed (2 hours at 37°C), and the peptides were purified by solid-phase extraction and evaporated. A 10-minute UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated, and normal values were established.

Our results show that women with preeclampsia had abnormal urine levels of both proteins, with higher sensitivity for podocalyxin. Fabry male patients presented a slight elevation of podocin, while untreated Fabry females had increased concentrations of both podocalyxin and podocin. Correlations were established between these biomarkers and some clinical parameters.

This reliable methodology could be an efficient tool for the early diagnosis of preeclampsia and Fabry disease and is applicable to other genetic and non-genetic kidney diseases.

**Presenting Author:** Mihai Victor Curtasu, Aarhus University, Denmark  
**Co-Authors:** Valeria Tafintseva, Zachary Bendiks, Maria L. Marco, Achim Kohler, Yetong Xu, Helle Nygaard Lærke, Knud Erik Bach Knudsen, Mette Skou Hedemann

This study aimed to explore the effects of ad libitum feeding of two high-fat diets, supplemented with either high amylose maize starch (HIMA) or fructose, on the fecal metabolome and microbiota composition in obese Göttingen minipigs, a model for human metabolic disorders. Thirty minipigs were fed experimental diets for five months, and fecal samples were collected three times during the intervention.

Non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to explore metabolite differences, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified by gas chromatography, and bacterial diversity was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Sequencing data were analyzed using QIIME 2, and a sparse multi-block partial least squares regression model was calculated.

Higher proportions of Bacteroidetes and higher quantities of total organic acids and SCFAs were found in the fecal contents of animals fed HIMA compared to those fed fructose. Concentrations of acetate and the sum of acetate, propionate, and butyrate were positively associated with the Ruminococcus genus and increased levels of several dicarboxylic acids and pantothenic acid. Minipigs fed fructose had higher butyrate levels, which were closely associated with enrichments in Roseburia, Clostridiaceae, Turicibacter, and Ruminococcus (Lachnospiraceae family). Bacteria from the Coprococcus, Blautia, and Coprococcus genera were associated with higher enterolactone levels.

Overall, different carbohydrate sources induced contrasting microbial taxa, leading to divergent fecal metabolome profiles.

### P-192: Analysis of Bile Acid Profiles in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Depending on NAFLD Severity

**Presenting Author:** Youngae Jung, KBSI, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Won Kim, Geum-Sook Hwang

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease characterized by hepatic triglyceride accumulation. NAFLD progresses from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Bile acids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

In this study, we analyzed bile acid profiles in 234 Asian subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD and metabolically healthy controls using LC-MS. Bile acid profiles included 13 bile acids: cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), taurodeoxycholic acid (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA), and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA).

Most bile acids showed significant increases in NASH compared to NAFL, while there were no significant changes in NAFL compared to No-NAFLD. Primary bile acids were mainly increased in NASH. Our results indicate that bile acid profiles in NAFLD patients change depending on the severity of the disease and the type of bile acid.

### P-193: Plasma Metabolomics Identifies Potential Biomarkers in Different Stages of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

**Presenting Author:** Xiangping Lin, Laboratoire CSPBAT - Paris 13 University - UFR SMBH, France  
**Co-Authors:** Xinyu Liu, Mohamed Triba, Zhicheng Liu, Laurence Le Moyec, Marianne Ziol, Nada Helmy, Corinne Vons, Nadia Bouchemal, Guowang Xu, Carina Prip-buus, Philippe Savarin

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by abnormal triglyceride (TG) accumulation in the liver and is becoming the most common chronic liver disease in adults. Previous studies have shown that plasma metabolome is a better predictor for steatosis (80%) than non-invasive basal clinical data (58%).

In this study, we investigated whether high-resolution mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics could identify potential biomarkers in different stages of NAFLD and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in its progression. Plasma samples were collected from obese subjects with normal liver (n=19), steatosis (n=39), and NASH (n=24). To cover polar and non-polar metabolites, samples were analyzed using two separate ultra-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) platforms.

Compared to subjects with normal liver, those with steatosis or NASH had abnormal liver function, high plasma TG concentrations, and insulin resistance. Binary logistic regression analysis identified panels of potential biomarkers for steatosis, NASH, and the distinction between steatosis and NASH. The regression models were evaluated by internal validation, with an area under the ROC curve of around 0.7 (mean for validation).

Although the small sample size is a limitation, our results suggest that high-resolution mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics is a promising approach to identify plasma biomarkers of NAFLD. External validation is in progress, and once validated in independent studies, these biomarkers could help diagnose steatosis from NASH, monitor NAFLD development, and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease progression.

### P-195: The Impact of Ulcers on the Metabolomic Profile of Serum in Diabetic Patients

**Presenting Author:** Arsenty Melnikov, International Tomography Center SB RAS / Novosibirsk State University, Russian Federation  
**Co-Authors:** Yuriy Tsentalovich, Vadim Yanshole

Diabetic ulcers are a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and are poorly studied. This study aimed to conduct a comparative metabolomic analysis of serum from patients with type 2 DM with and without ulcers. Two high-performance liquid chromatography methods (HILIC and RPLC) in conjunction with high-resolution ESI-q-TOF mass-spectrometric detection were used to obtain serum metabolomic profiles.

This approach allowed the registration of over 1700 features, yielding more than 250 metabolites and lipids. For most metabolites, their levels in the serum of diabetic patients with and without ulcers were similar, with a few exceptions. Notably, 1,5-anhydroglucitol (fold change = 3.2, AUC = 0.96 ± 0.02), bilirubin (fold change = -3.1, AUC = 0.89 ± 0.03), and a group of phospholipids (mean fold change = -1.48 ± 0.02) showed significant differences (p < 0.05).

This study indicates that the development of diabetic ulcers is accompanied by a decrease in the concentrations of phospholipids and some lipid-related metabolites.

### P-196: Fast Detection of Drugs and Metabolites in Urine by Flow Injection Analysis Coupled to Magnetic Resonance Mass Spectrometry

**Presenting Author:** Christopher Thompson, Bruker Daltonics Inc., United States  
**Co-Authors:** Matthias Witt, Aiko Barsch, Markus Godejohann

A fast method for detecting drugs and their metabolites in urine using flow injection analysis (FIA) and magnetic resonance mass spectrometry (MRMS) is presented. Approximately 250 samples can be measured in 24 hours using this technique. Pooled urine samples were purified by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using Merck LiChrolutEN SPE cartridges. Samples were extracted with methanol from SPE cartridges and diluted in methanol for FIA. Each sample was analyzed in 5 minutes by FIA-MRMS in ESI in positive and negative ion modes. Spectra were acquired in a mass range of m/z 107 – 3000 in quadrupolar detection mode with a resolving power of 1,350,000 at m/z 200. For the final mass spectrum, 28 single scans were averaged.

Data analysis was performed with MetaboScape 4.0, combining ESI(+) and ESI(-) data for feature analysis. More than 2100 features were found for the pooled urine samples, with over 90% of detected features assigned a molecular formula. 300 drug candidates were annotated in the urine samples by matching a target list of expected compounds derived from HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/) with a mass error tolerance of only 0.5 ppm. The detected drugs were compared with the medication of the patients, and several drugs were found only in specific pooled urine samples. By comparing the relative abundances of features across all samples, possible metabolites of drugs were identified.

### P-197: Improved Identification of Human CSF Metabolites Using Workflow-Based Approaches Allowing Integration of Multiple Search Engines

**Presenting Author:** Kim Kultima, Uppsala University, Sweden  
**Co-Authors:** Payam Emami Khoonsari, Christoph Ruttkies, Stephanie Herman, Kristian Peters, Ralf Weber, Thomas Lawson, Joachim Burman, Ola Spjuth, Steffen Neumann, and members of the ELIXIR Implementation Study on Metabolite Identification

Untargeted metabolomics, a high-throughput molecular phenotyping technique, is growing across all life sciences domains. Data processing and analysis are often performed using various tools with little standardization and automation, hindering interoperability and reproducibility. We have previously developed a comprehensive and interoperable workflow that integrates all necessary components for mass spectrometry-based identification and quantification of metabolites and downstream analysis.

To improve metabolite identification, we developed a workflow approach that integrates MS1 and MS2 information, enhancing statistical scoring and reducing computation time. The workflow includes multiple search engines such as CSI:FingerID and MetFrag. It can directly connect to the MetaboLights data repository and performs identification, quantification, alignment, and matching using a large collection of available tools. This approach achieved complete integration of several major metabolomics software suites, resulting in a turn-key workflow for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. This workflow vastly improved the identification of metabolites expressed in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is available on Galaxy, Nextflow, and Pachyderm on PhenoMeNal.

This study is part of the European collaborative ELIXIR Implementation Study on Metabolite Identification.

### P-198: DecoMetDIA: Deconvolution of Multiplexed MS/MS Spectra for Metabolite Identification in SWATH-MS Based Untargeted Metabolomics

**Presenting Author:** Yandong Yin, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China  
**Co-Author:** Zheng-jiang Zhu

Recent advances in mass spectrometry have increased interest in data-independent acquisition (DIA) techniques for metabolomics. DIA allows the sequential selection and isolation of all metabolite ions using a wide window to generate multiplexed MS/MS spectra, enabling continuous and unbiased acquisition of all metabolites. However, DIA presents a challenge to data analysis due to the loss of the direct link between precursor and fragment ions.

Currently, few DIA data processing methods are available for metabolomics, including MS-DIAL and MetDIA. There is a lack of software tools to support SWATH-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Here, we present a new software tool, DecoMetDIA, to support metabolite identification in SWATH-MS-based untargeted metabolomics with spectra deconvolution and extracted MS2 EICs. Large-scale metabolite annotation of the MS2 spectra deconvoluted by DecoMetDIA using MetDNA and Sirius/CSI:FingerID showed that about 70-80% of features were annotated, indicating high accuracy and readiness for large-scale metabolite identification.

**Co-Authors:** Khalid I. W. Kane, Siham Hachi, Moriz Walter, Javier Jarazo, Miguel A. P. Oliveira, Thomas Hankemeier, Paul Vulto, Jens C. Schwamborn, Martin Thoma, Ronan M. T. Fleming

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the dysfunction and death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Developing human in vitro cellular models of PD is a significant challenge. We constructed an automated cell culture platform optimized for long-term maintenance and monitoring of cells in three-dimensional microfluidic devices. The system is flexible, adaptable to various experimental protocols, and features time-lapse imaging microscopy for quality control and electrophysiology monitoring to assess cellular activity.

Using this system, we continuously monitored the differentiation of Parkinson’s disease patient-derived human neuroepithelial stem cells into midbrain-specific dopaminergic neurons. Calcium imaging confirmed the electrophysiological activity of differentiated neurons, and immunostaining confirmed the efficiency of the differentiation protocol. This system is the first example of an automated Organ-on-a-Chip culture and has the potential to enable versatile in vitro experiments for patient-specific disease modeling.

### P-200: Comprehensive Analysis of Metabolites Using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS - An Application to the Research of the Intestinal Environment

**Presenting Author:** Akihiro Kunisawa, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Akihiro Kunisawa, Takanari Hattori, Shuichi Kawana, Shin-ichi Kawano, Yoshihiro Hayakawa, Junko Iida, Eiichiro Fukusaki, Mitsuharu Matsumoto

Intestinal microbiota produce metabolites that are absorbed from the intestinal lumen and carried to systemic circulation, playing a direct role in health and disease. Recent attention has focused on the relationship between intestinal microbiota, their metabolites, and health. However, most studies target specific metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, rather than the global metabolome.

In this study, we analyzed metabolites in mouse feces using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS for comprehensive analysis. GC-MS/MS analysis detected 100 metabolites, primarily short-chain fatty acids, organic acids, and sugars. Ion-pairing LC-MS/MS detected 17 metabolites, mainly amino acids. Non-ion-pairing LC-MS/MS detected 75 metabolites, including amino acids, nucleotides, nucleosides, and organic acids. These results indicate that comprehensive analysis using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS is effective for studying the intestinal environment. We also report on the interpretation of metabolome data using the Shimadzu Multi-omics Data Analysis Pack, which facilitates the examination of results.

**Co-Authors:** Allison Guinta, Nicolas Del Bene, Neethu Abraham, Lauren Junker, Wendy Chan, Hunter Cameron, Anita Samuga, Nengyi Zhang, George Kritikos, Vimal Rawat, Girish Srinivas, Sabrina Letoy-Okombi, Valérie André

Understanding the changes in human skin during aging is crucial for developing novel cosmetic ingredients. Aging of the facial skin is accompanied by profound changes in the skin microbiota and biophysical skin quality parameters. To gain a better understanding of the interactions between the skin and its microbiota, we conducted a simultaneous analysis of the skin microbiome and metabolome in the crow’s feet/undereye area in cohorts of approximately 50 young (age 18–35 years, wrinkle grade 0–1) and 50 aged (age > 55 years, wrinkle grade 5–6) healthy Caucasian women. This poster presentation focuses on the metabolomic characteristics of these two cohorts.

### P-202: Simultaneous Quantification of Tryptophan Pathway Metabolites in Serum, Plasma, and Faeces Using UHPLC-MS/MS Method

**Presenting Author:** Dai Long Vu, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** Andras Balogh, Hendrik Bartolomaeus, Jennifer Kirwan

Tryptophan and its metabolites play key roles in heart and brain health. The fate of tryptophan involves an interplay between the host and gut microbiome. Quantifying tryptophan pathway metabolites provides important information about its eventual fate in the body, which is relevant for studying certain diseases. While current methods exist for quantifying a subset of these metabolites, methods for simultaneous quantification of most of these compounds are still missing.

We demonstrate a robust, accurate, and reproducible method for the quantification of 30 tryptophan pathway-related compounds using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The method was fully validated for serum, plasma, and faeces, following European Medicines Agency guidelines. We report on the analytical linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, matrix effect, recovery, accuracy, and precision of the method. Stability of standards and samples was also investigated. Except for tryptophan, which degraded after 24 hours at 4°C, all other tested compounds were stable up to 48 hours, exceeding the run length of a typical batch. Our method also offers high throughput, as the separation in a reversed phase system can separate analytes in a 10-minute gradient, facilitating the analysis of batches with a high number of samples.

### P-203: Effect of Nutrition on Host-Gut Microbiota Metabolic Interactions in Preterm Infants Fed Own Mother's Milk and Donated Mother's Milk

**Presenting Author:** José David Piñeiro, Neonatal Research Group, Spain  
**Co-Authors:** Anna Parra-Llorca, María Gormaz, María Cernada, Guillermo Quintás, María Carmen Collado, Máximo Vento, Julia Kuligowski

Breastfeeding is the gold standard for term and preterm infant nutrition. For preterm infants whose mothers cannot provide own mother’s milk (OMM), pasteurized donor human milk (DHM) is the preferred alternative. This study aimed to understand the metabolic signature of preterm infants to unravel the effect of nutrition on their metabolism.

Urine samples from 40 preterm infants, 20 fed OMM and 20 fed DHM, aged between 2 and 4 weeks, were collected and analyzed using Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS). A peak table was extracted with XCMS, and 2241 m/z features were retained after data pre-processing and filtering. Pathway analysis (MetaboAnalyst) revealed significant alterations in three pathways related to hormone biosynthesis. Significant differences were found between urinary fingerprints of preterm infants receiving OMM and DHM (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, p-value = 0.009). 73 features were annotated, corresponding to 25 metabolites. Seven putatively annotated metabolites were related to gut microbiome activity.

This is the first study of the urinary metabolome of preterm infants fed DHM vs. OMM. Observed changes could be attributed to diet-dependent changes in the colonization pattern of preterm infants, affecting hormone production, changes in hormone levels in human milk, and/or the effect of pasteurization on DHM hormone levels. Future studies are encouraged to assess the impact of maternal nutrition, treatment, and storage on human milk composition.
