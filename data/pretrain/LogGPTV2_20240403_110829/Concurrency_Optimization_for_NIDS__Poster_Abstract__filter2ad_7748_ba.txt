homeostasis by increasing the induction of FGF21 from liver B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is the major neutral amino acid transporter in the lumen of the 
intestine that carries out the bulk of amino acid absorption from the diet It also reabsorbs neutral amino acids in proximal tubule of the kidney 
Mice lacking B0AT1 show signs of protein restriction such as elevated levels of FGF21 and reduced mTORC1 activity Moreover they have improved 
glucose homeostasis and are protected from diet induced obesity, making it a potential target to treat metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria 
and type 2 diabetes We determined the postprandial levels of amino acids and other metabolites under low, standard and high protein diet of 
SLC6A19ko, wt and hz mice All essential amino acids showed a significant positive correlation with the protein content of the diet in WT mice 
The neutral AAs that requires SLC6A19 for its absorption were reduced in the blood of SLC6A19ko mice whereas other amino acids showed no 
significant difference as compared to WT mice The reduced levels of neutral AA were more prominent under conditions of high protein diet We 
also found a few bacterial metabolites of AA fermentation that were correlating with the protein content of the diet in the blood of SLC6A19ko mice 
This study highlights the potential of this transporter as a target to induce protein restriction for the treatment of metabolic disorders

A Reliable Mass Spectrometry Methodology for Podocyturia Evaluation in Genetic and Non-Genetic Kidney Diseases
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Christiane Auray-Blais, Université de Sherbrooke, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Tristan Martineau, Michel Boutin, Anne-Marie-Côté, Bruno Maranda, Daniel Bichet
Increased podocyte levels in urine (podocyturia) is an early sign of kidney abnormalities in patients Currently, kidney damages are evaluated by 
using proteinuria measurements and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which, in some cases, might not always be efficient for early 
detection of patients Moreover, most analytical techniques for the evaluation of podocyturia are tedious, time-consuming, and may lead to marked 
results variability The primary objective of this research project was to develop and validate a multiplex, quantitative ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) approach to evaluate two proteins related to podocyturia, podocalyxin and podocin in 
urine samples The secondary aim targeted the analysis of these biomarkers in samples from women with preeclampsia, Fabry disease patients, and 
related gender-matched controls One mL of a random urine sample was centrifuged, followed by the addition of cleavable peptide standards to 
the supernatant Trypsin digestion was performed (2h at 37oC) and the peptides were purified by solid-phase extraction and evaporated A 10-min 
UPLC-MS/MS was developed and validated Normal values were established Our results show that women with preeclampsia had abnormal urine 
levels of both proteins with a higher sensitivity for podocalyxin Fabry male patients presented a slight elevation of podocin whereas untreated 
Fabry females had increased concentrations of both podocalyxin and podocin Correlations were established with these biomarkers and some 
clinical parameters This reliable methodology might be an efficient tool for early diagnosis of women with preeclampsia and Fabry disease patients 
It is also applicable to other genetic and non-genetic kidney diseases

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mihai Victor Curtasu, Aarhus University, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Valeria Tafintseva, Zachary Bendiks, Maria L. Marco, Achim Kohler, Yetong Xu, Helle Nygaard Lærke, Knud Erik Bach Knudsen, 
Mette Skou Hedemann.
The objective of this study was to explore the effects of ad libitum feeding of two high-fat diets supplemented with either high amylose maize starch 
(HIMA) or fructose on the fecal metabolome and microbiota composition These effects were examined in obese Göttingen Minipigs as a model for 
human metabolic disorders Thirty Göttingen Minipigs were fed with two experimental diets for five months, and fecal material was sampled three 
times during the dietary intervention Non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to explore metabolite differences, short-
chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified by gas chromatography, and bacterial diversity was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing Sequencing 
data were analyzed using QIIME 2, and together with metabolomics and SCFAs data a sparse multi-block partial least squares regression model 
was calculated Higher proportions of Bacteroidetes were found in the fecal contents of animals fed HIMA compared to that fed fructose together 
with higher quantities of total organic acids and total SCFAs Furthermore, concentrations of acetate and acetate+propionate+butyrate were 
positively associated with the Ruminococcus genus and increased levels of several dicarboxylic acids (2,4-dimethyladipic acid, 3,3-methylglutaric 
acid) and pantothenic acid Minipigs fed fructose contained higher butyrate levels, which were closely associated with enrichments in Roseburia, 
Clostridiaceae, Turicibacter, and Ruminococcus (Lachnospiraceae family) Bacteria from the Coprococcus, Blautia or Coprococcus genera were 
associated with a higher intensity of enterolactone (m/z 2971135; [M+Cl] m/z 3330902) Overall, we observed that different carbohydrate sources 
induced a contrasting stimulation of the microbial taxa which further reflected in a divergent fecal metabolome profile

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Youngae Jung, KBSI, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Won Kim, Geum-Sook Hwang
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of common causes of chronic liver disease that involve hepatic accumulation of triglycerides NAFLD 
is progressed from a nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Bile acids has been considered to be related with 
pathogenesis of NAFLD In this study, we analyzed the profile of bile acids in NAFLD patients using LC-MS system Sera acquired from 234 Asian 
subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD and metabolically healthy controls were used for analysis of bile acids Bile acid profiles included total 13 bile 
acids such as cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), 
glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), taurodeoxycholic acid (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholic 
aicd (TCDCA), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA), tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) Most of bile acids showed 
the significant increases in NASH compared to NAFL, whiles didn’t show the significant changes in NAFL compared to No-NAFLD And primary bile 
acids were mainly increased in NASH Our results showed that the bile acid profiles in NAFLD patients were changed depending on NAFLD severity 
and also presented to differently be changed according to types of bile acids

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by abnormal accumulation of triglycerides (TGs) in the liver, which is becoming the 
most common chronic liver diseases in the global adult population A previous study found that plasma metabolome was a better predictor for 
steatosis (80%) than noninvasive basal clinical data (58%) In this study, we investigate whether High-resolution mass spectrometry-based Plasma 
metabolomics could identify potentials biomarkers in different stages of the disease, and explore the further molecular mechanism involved in 
the progression of NAFLD Plasma were collected from obese subjects with Normal liver (n=19), Steatosis (n=39) and NASH (n=24) To cover polar 
and non-polar metabolites, samples analysis were performed using two separated ultra-performance liquid chromatography High-resolution 
mass spectrometry-based Metabolomic and lipidomic platform, respectively Compared with Normal liver obese, Steatosis or NASH subjects had 
abnormal liver function, high plasma TGs concentrations and were insulino-resistance Binary Logistic Regression analysis found each a panel of 
potentials biomarkers for Steatosis, NASH and Steatosis from NASH, the regression models were evaluated by internal validation with Area under 
the ROC Curve around 07 (mean for validation) The small sample size may be a limit of this study, still, our results suggested that High-resolution 
mass spectrometry-based Plasma metabolomics may be a promising way to identify plasma biomarkers of NAFLD, the external validation is in 
progress, after validated in other independent studies, these biomarkers might help to diagnosis Steatosis from NASH, monitor development of 
NAFLD and shed light further on molecular mechanism involved in disease progression

The impact of ulcers on the metabolomic profile of serum of diabetic patients
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Arsenty Melnikov, International Tomography Center SB RAS / Novosibirsk State University, Russian Federation
CO-AUTHORS: Yuriy Tsentalovich, Vadim Yanshole
It is believed that the alternations in lipid and protein catabolism in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to various complications, such as 
diabetic ulcer Despite the fact that diabetic ulcer is one of the most common complication of DM, it is still poorly studied Current study is devoted 
to the comparative metabolomic analysis of serum obtained from patients with type 2 DM with and without ulcers To obtain the serum metabolomic 
profiles, two high-performance liquid chromatography methods (HILIC and RPLC) in conjunction with high-resolution ESI-q-TOF mass-spectrometric 
detection were used This approach made possible to register more than 1700 features (in both HILIC and RPLC data), yielding more than 250 
metabolites and lipids For the majority of metabolites, their levels in the serum of diabetic patients with and without ulcers are similar, with few 
exceptions including 1,5–anhydroglucitol (fold change = 32, AUC = 096 ± 002), bilirubin (fold change = -31, AUC = 089 ± 003) and a group of 
phospholipids with the mean fold change equals to -148 ± 002 For all listed differences the p-value is lower than 005 This study shows that 
the development of diabetic ulcer is accompanied by the decrease in the concentrations of phospholipids and some lipid-related metabolites

Mass Spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Christopher Thompson, Bruker Daltonics Inc., United States
CO-AUTHORS: Matthias Witt, Aiko Barsch, Markus Godejohann
A fast method for detection of drugs and their metabolites in urine using flow injection analysis (FIA) and magnetic resonance mass spectrometry 
(MRMS) is presented Roughly 250 samples can be measured in 24h using this technique Pooled urine samples were purified by SPE using 
Merck LiChrolutEN SPE cartridges Samples were extracted with methanol from SPE cartridges and diluted in Methanol for FIA Each sample was 
analyzed in 5 minutes by FIA-MRMS in ESI in positive and negative ion mode Spectra were acquired in a mass range m/z 107 – 3000 in quadrupolar 
detection mode with a resolving power of 1,350,000 at m/z 200 For the final mass spectrum 28 single scans were averaged Analysis of data was 
performed with MetaboScape 40 The data of the ESI(+) and ESI(-) were combined for feature analysis More than 2100 features were found for the 
pooled urine samples More than 90% of the detected features could be assigned with a molecular formula 300 drug candidates were annotated in 
the urine samples by matching a target list of expected compounds derived from HMDB (http://wwwhmdbca/) with a mass error tolerance of only 
05 ppm The detected drugs were compared with the medication of the patients Several drugs were found only in specific pooled urine samples 
By comparing the relative abundances of features of all samples, possible metabolites of drugs could be identified

CO-AUTHORS: Payam Emami Khoonsari, Christoph Ruttkies, Stephanie Herman, Kristian Peters, Ralf Weber, Thomas Lawson, Joachim 
Burman, Ola Spjuth, Steffen Neumann and Kim Kultima and members of the ELIXIR Implementation Study on Metabolite Identification
Untargeted metabolomics as a high-throughput molecular phenotyping technique is growing across all domains in the life sciences The data 
processing and analysis is often performed using different tools with little standardization and automation for interoperable and reproducible 
research We have previously developed a comprehensive and interoperable workflow that integrates all necessary components for doing mass 
spectrometry-based identification and quantification of metabolites as well as the downstream analysis1–3 To improve metabolite identification 
we have now developed a workflow approach that allows integration of MS1 and MS2 information, resulting in improvement in statistical scoring 
of the identified compounds as well as a substantial decrease in computation time The workflow includes multiple search engines such as 
CSI:FingerID and MetFrag The workflow presented can directly connect to the MetaboLights data repository, and performs identification as well 
as quantification, alignment, and matching using a large collection of available tools Together, we achieved a complete integration of several 
major metabolomics software suites resulting in a turn-key workflow for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics This approach vastly improved 
identification of metabolites expressed in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) The workflow is available on Galaxy, Nextflow and Pachyderm on 
PhenoMeNal This study is part of the European collaborative ELIXIR Implementation Study on Metabolite Identification

DecoMetDIA: Deconvolution of Multiplexed MS/MS Spectra for Metabolite Identification in SWATH-MS based  
Untargeted Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yandong Yin, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China
CO-AUTHORS: Zheng-jiang Zhu
With recent advances in mass spectrometry, there is an increased interest in data-independent acquisition (DIA) techniques for metabolomics 
With DIA technique, all metabolite ions are sequentially selected and isolated using a wide window to generate multiplexed MS/MS spectra DIA 
strategy enables a continuous and unbiased acquisition of all metabolites and increases the data dimensionality, but presents a challenge to data 
analysis due to the loss of the direct link between precursor ion and fragment ions Currently, only few DIA data processing methods are developed 
for metabolomics application, including MS-DIAL and MetDIA Nevertheless, there is still a lack of software tools to support the SWATH-MS based 
untargeted metabolomics Here we presented a new software tool, namely, DecoMetDIA, to support metabolite identification in SWATH-MS 
based untargeted metabolomics with spectra deconvolution with extracted MS2 EICs to satisfy the need of data processing tools for SWATH-MS 
technique in metabolomics With the large-scale metabolite annotation of the MS2 spectra deconvoluted by DecoMetDIA using MetDNA and Sirius/
CSI:FingerID, we found that about 70~80% features were annotated, which proved that the MS2 spectra deconvoluted by DecoMetDIA were of high 
accuracy and ready to be used for large scale metabolite identification

Parkinson’s disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterised by dysfunction and death of selectively vulnerable midbrain 
dopaminergic neurons and the development of human in vitro cellular models of the disease is a major challenge in Parkinson’s disease research 
We constructed an automated cell culture platform optimised for long-term maintenance and monitoring of different cells in three dimensional 
microfluidic cell culture devices The system can be flexibly adapted to various experimental protocols and features time-lapse imaging microscopy 
for quality control and electrophysiology monitoring to assess cellular activity Using this system, we continuously monitored the differentiation of 
Parkinson’s disease patient derived human neuroepithelial stem cells into midbrain specific dopaminergic neurons Calcium imaging confirmed the 
electrophysiological activity of differentiated neurons and immunostaining confirmed the efficiency of the differentiation protocol This system is the 
first example of an automated Organ-on-a-Chip culture and has the potential to enable a versatile array of in vitro experiments for patient-specific 
disease modelling

A part of the metabolites produced by intestinal microbiota are absorbed constantly from the intestinal lumen and carried to systemic circulation; 
and play a direct role in health and disease Recently, increasing attention has been devoted to the relationship among intestinal microbiota, 
the metabolites, and health and disease There are limited reports concerning the function of metabolites produced by intestinal microbiome 
Furthermore, these studies are targeting specific metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids but not global metabolites (metabolome) In this 
study, we analyzed metabolites in mice feces using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS for comprehensive analysis As results of GC-MS/MS analysis for 
the extracts of the mice feces, 100 metabolites were detected Main compounds of 100 metabolites were short-chain fatty acids, organic acids and 
sugars Seventeen sugars that are difficult to analyze using LC-MS/MS were detected As results of ion-pairing LC-MS/MS analysis, 17 metabolites 
which were mainly amino acids were detected As results of non- ion-pairing LC-MS/MS analysis, 75 metabolites were detected Main compounds of 
75 metabolites were amino acids, nucleotides, nucleosides and organic acids These results indicated that comprehensive analysis of metabolites 
using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS is effective for the research of the intestinal environment In addition, we also report on the interpretation of the 
metabolome data using the Shimadzu Multi-omics Data Analysis Pack, which will facilitate the examination of the results

An in-depth understanding of the changes which are occurring on multiple levels in the human skin during aging is of major interest for the 
development of novel cosmetic ingredients Aging of the facial skin is known to be accompanied by profound changes in the skin microbiota and 
in biophysical skin quality parameters (eg Jugé et al 2018, J Appl Microbiol 125, 907; Zouboulis et al 2018, Mech Ageing Dev 170, 98) To gain 
a better understanding of the interactions between the skin and its microbiota, we have conducted a simultaneous analysis of the skin microbiome 
and metabolome in the crow’s feet/undereye area in cohorts of ≈ 50 young (age 18–35 years, wrinkle grade 0–1) and ≈ 50 aged (age > 55 years, 
wrinkle grade 5–6) healthy Caucasian women This poster presentation will focus of the metabolomic characteristics of these two cohorts

Simultaneous quantification of tryptophan pathway metabolites in serum, plasma and faeces using UHPLC-MS/MS method
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dai Long Vu, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicines, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Andras Balogh, Hendrik Bartolomaeus, Jennifer Kirwan
Tryptophan and its metabolites play key roles in heart and brain health The eventual fate of tryptophan involves an interplay between host and gut 
microbiome Quantification of the tryptophan pathway metabolites provides important information about the eventual fate of tryptophan in the body 
which may be important for the study of certain diseases Although current methods exist for the quantification of a subset of these metabolites, 
methods for simultaneous quantification of most of these compounds are still missing We demonstrate a robust, accurate, reproducible method 
for the quantification of 30 compounds related to the tryptophan pathway using an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) technique The analytical method was fully validated for serum, plasma and faeces, following European Medicines 
Agency guidelines We report on the analytical linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, matrix effect, recovery, accuracy and precision 
of the method In addition, stability of standards and samples were also investigated Except for tryptophan which was degraded after 24 hours at 
4 oC, all other tested compounds were stable up to 48 hours, exceeding the run length of a typical batch Our study also offers a high throughput 
analytical method as the separation in a reversed phase system can separate the analytes in a 10 minute gradient, fostering the analysis of batches 
with high number of samples

Breastfeeding is the gold standard for nutrition of the term and preterm infant For preterm infants whose mothers are unable to provide of own 
mother’s milk (OMM), pasteurized donor human milk (DHM) is the preferred alternative Here, the metabolic signature of preterm infants has been 
studied to unscramble the effect of nutrition on their metabolism Urine samples of 40 preterm infants fed with OMM (N=20) and DHM (N=20) aged 
between 2 and 4 weeks of life were collected and analysed employing Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry A peak table 
was extracted with XCMS and a total of 2241 m/z features were retained after data pre-processing and filtering Pathway analysis (MetaboAnalyst) 
revealed a significant alteration of three pathways related to the biosynthesis of hormones Significant differences were found between urinary 
fingerprints of preterm infants receiving OMM and DHM (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, p-value=0009) 73 features were annotated 
corresponding to a total of 25 metabolites Seven putatively annotated metabolites were related to the activity of the gut microbiome This is the first 
study of the urinary metabolome of preterm infants fed with DHM vs OMM Observed changes could be potentially attributed to i) diet-dependent 
changes in the colonization pattern of preterm infants that might affect hormone production, ii) changes in the hormone levels in human milk and/or 
iii) the effect of pasteurization on DHM hormone levels Based on the results, future studies for assessing the impact of maternal nutrition as well as 
treatment and storage on human milk composition are encouraged
