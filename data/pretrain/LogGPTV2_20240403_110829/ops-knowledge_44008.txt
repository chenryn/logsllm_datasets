User: I have a python script that output/prints a large array (50MB in size) to the screen. This script is running on machineA. Is it at all possible to 'pipe' this output to machineB, where it will be processed?
I know I can save the output in a file on machineA and then send the file to machineB. I was just wondering if it is possible to do so without having to save the data first to a file (on machineA).
Any solutions (python, bash shell, other ideas) will be appreciated.
Assistant: You can do it on different levels - here are a few options

use ssh to pipe 
      myprog | ssh remotemachine myotherprog
use nfs (if going to a file
use netcat (nc)
use something like thrift

It depends on how solid & permanent the solution needs to be
