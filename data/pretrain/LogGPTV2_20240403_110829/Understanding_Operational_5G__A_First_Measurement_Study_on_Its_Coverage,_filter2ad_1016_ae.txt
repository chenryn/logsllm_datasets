expose an interface for 4G-5G switching. For comparison, we also
implement the current power management approaches (with DRX
configuration of 4G LTE and 5G NSA NR in Tab. 7 and an Oracle
model (i.e., with perfect sleep and awake transition) approach un-
der 5G. We collect 3 types of real-wold traffic using Wireshark (i.e.,
short web page browsing, frame-by-frame UHD video telephony
and saturated file transfer, 10 flows for each type), and replay them
in simulated state machines. Note that here each model finishes the
whole data transfer of all flows, so that the completion time under
4G and 5G are diverse, which is different from that in Fig. 21 where
all experiments last the same time.
Tab. 4 summarizes the results. We observe that: (i) Dynamic
mode switching saves a remarkable amount of energy (24.8%) over
the NR NSA for unsaturated web browsing flows. It is noteworthy
that dynamic 4G-5G switching may also be a use case for MPTCP
[53], which is an interesting topic particularly considering the long-
term 4G/5G coexistence. We leave this for future exploration. (ii)
The NR Oracle does not show a significant advantage over NR
NSA, with an average gain of 13.2%, implying optimizing the 5G
power management protocol alone provides marginal benefits, as
the bottleneck may lie in the hardware itself.
7 RELATED WORK
5G measurements. In general, empirical studies of commercial
5G networks are quite limited as they were deployed only a few
months ago. Qualcomm, as a major 5G radio manufacturer, released
a white paper to profile 5G performance [69], but mainly focusing
on signal quality and coverage. Narayanan et al. conducted a pre-
liminary measurement of the 5G mmWave network [61], which
differs drastically from the sub-6 GHz 5G NR due to the use of
much higher frequencies and directional beams. In addition, the
study mainly focused on upper layer performance due to lack of
access to physical/MAC layer diagnostic information. In contrast,
our measurement campaign represents the first to measure and an-
alyze commercial sub 6 GHz 5G NR. Using a set of cross-layer tools,
we were able to identify critical protocol level and computational
bottlenecks for 5G (e.g., the TCP anomaly and high energy cost
under NSA), which has not been discussed before.
5G modeling and simulation. Prior to the deployment and
commercialization of 5G NR, extensive theoretical modeling or
simulation study have been performed, from various perspectives
such as flatten radio access architecture [79], software-defined core
network [26], ultra-dense picocell [40] to multi-radio (cloud) access
[67], massive MIMO [57], interference management [62], spectrum
sharing with cognitive radio [81],etc. More references can be found
in survey studies [14, 35]. Our measurement study complements
such works through a comprehensive profiling of commercial 5G
networks in a realistic environment.
Measurement studies on legacy 4G. Substantial research ef-
fort has been devoted to 4G cellular networks since their commer-
cial deployment. We categorize representative topics as follows: (i)
The 4G cellular infrastructure, deployment and hand-off have been
extensively studied in literatures, such as [54, 74] and references
therein, which discover and propose optimization methods for the
specific challenges as cells going smaller, including coverage holes
and instability of mobility management, etc. (ii) In term of transport
performance, many papers re-visited the classical congestion con-
trol algorithms under 4G LTE, and identified new problems such as
bufferbloat[33, 38], cross-layer gap [43, 78, 89], and network bottle-
neck [19]. Besides the traditional urban or rural measurement fields,
recent works also examined how 4G performs under emerging sce-
narios such as high-speed rails [53, 80]. (iii) Many popular mobile
applications are known to suffer from low quality of experience in
cellular networks. Approaches to improve application performance
have been proposed for panoramic VR [37, 75, 88], web browsing
[47, 93], etc. (iv) As for energy consumption, early work for 4G
[84, 97] enhances smartphone’s energy managements with adap-
tive DTX or DRX algorithms and optimized RRC state machine,
while [41, 42] propose an empirical traffic-driven power model. We
note that 5G exhibits substantially different behaviors compared
against 4G, and poses new challenges and opportunities in multiple
dimensions, such as infrastructure development, transport protocol
design, and application QoE optimization. Our work represents the
first to reveal such perspectives, which can be further explored by
follow on research.
Our study relies on a set of custom-built and commercial tools to
enable cross-layer cellular network analytics. Although such tools
with similar capabilities have been developed for 4G LTE [51, 55, 63],
they are heavily tailored for the 4G physical/MAC layer, and do not
support 5G yet.
8 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
5G spectrum. According to the 3GPP standards, 5G’s spectrum in-
cludes the sub-6 band (also called C-band, from 0.45 GHz to 6 GHz)
and millimeter-wave (mmWave) band (from 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz).
In practice, an operator’s choice of 5G band depends on its spec-
trum license and technical/business considerations. For example,
China Mobile builds its 5G network over 2.5 GHz - 2.6 GHz and 4.8
GHz - 4.9 GHz band, China Unicom uses 3.4 GHz - 3.5 GHz, while
Verizon started their 5G deployment using the mmWave bands in
Minneapolis and Chicago [60, 61]. Our measurement is conducted
on the 3.5 GHz band, which is the most prevalent 5G deployment
during our study. We believe our findings still hold true for other
sub-6 bands. The mmWave bands may behave differently, especially
due to the distinct channel characteristics at higher frequencies.
For more details, one may refer to a recent measurement study of
the 28 GHz 5G networks [61], and many experimental works on
mmWave networks [82, 83, 95, 98].
In this work, we measure the 5G NR performance with a direct
comparison with 4G/LTE. As a licensed wireless access technology,
489
5G has fundamental differences from the unlicensed WiFi, even
though both use the sub-6 GHz band. For instance, the wireless
resource allocation in 5G is performed in a central way, while WiFi
client users contend resources in a distributed manner. More impor-
tantly, the 5G performance also depends on the cellular network
core, which is not a problem with WiFi.
performed on a university campus (0.5km× 0.92km), which is one
Measurement scale. The measurement of our work is mainly
of the first regions with 5G coverage worldwide (as of April 2019).
A few findings (particularly the network coverage) may change if
under another measurement area with different gNB density, but
other findings, like end-to-end TCP performance, video streaming
QoE and smartphone energy consumption, are unaffected by mea-
surement scale. Even with respect to network coverage, since the
ISP’s deployment goals are consistent across areas, we do not ex-
pect fundamental differences between the sample area and a larger
area.
A larger-scale study may be important for high mobility sce-
narios involving frequent hand-off, e.g., on moving cars or even
high-speed trains traversing between cities [53, 80]. However, 5G
coverage is far from continuous at intra-/inter-city scale for now,
and cannot support such high mobility. We thus leave this investi-
gation for future work.
Persistence of the measurement findings vs. network evo-
lution. Most observations in this measurement study are intrinsic
to 5G, although some issues could be resolved as the 5G RAN be-
comes mature and the core network evolves accordingly. In partic-
ular, the coverage holes can be eliminated as gNB density increases,
and the packet loss ratio will decrease if the ISPs can enhance their
Internet routers with larger buffer sizes, and the UEs’ energy con-
sumption may decrease as 5G-specific SoCs emerge. However, such
an infrastructure update involves high monetary cost and may take
a long time. The merit of this work lies in that it performs a rigorous
investigation of the existing 5G from multiple dimensions, and the
findings hint on directions for the coming 5G evolution.
Exploiting the coexistence of 4G and 5G. Our measurement
shows that the NSA architecture has caused several issues, including
large hand-off latency and low energy efficiency, which compro-
mises the effectiveness of 5G. It is expected that 5G NSA will persist
during the whole NSA→SA transition phase, lasting for 4∼5 years
[45]. A current pragmatic solution is to leverage on 4G/5G mode
adaptation to facilitate mobility and energy efficiency. Though the
idea has been primarily validated in this work, a systematic and
rigorous treatment is left for future study.
Looking into far future, the 5G control plane in SA will also have
a set of different challenges. For instance, there will be denser 5G
gNBs due to smaller coverage, which shall entail higher coordina-
tion complexity. In addition, the control plane in SA is expected to
be more efficient compared with the existing NSA architecture. To
meet the objective, the incorporation of new technologies including
MEC and SDN/NFV is needed [1, 21].
Can 5G replace DSL? A long-lasting debate is whether 5G can
replace the existing digital subscriber line (DSL), particularly for
home access networks. We examine such feasibility using trace-
driven simulation. In particular, we measure the throughput from
a gNB to a HUAWEI 5G CPE Pro [64] (i.e., a 5G-WiFi gateway)
placed in a residential building. The average throughput reaches
650 Mbps when the CPE stays at favorable locations (e.g., near
windows). Then, for a typical residential area (say 50 houses cov-
ered by a 5G gNB with 3 cells and 200m radius), each house can
get around 39 Mbps throughput, which exceeds the average DSL
bitrate of 24 Mbps in the US [23]. The result indicates that 5G can
potentially replace DSL in such settings. In addition, 3GPPP is cur-
rently developing the ATSSS service [2], which supplements the
WiFi/5G coexistence model as a trend for future indoor-outdoor
cooperatively deeper network coverage.
The potential impact of mobile edge computing. In Sec. 4.1
and 4.2, we attribute the abnormal TCP behaviors of many con-
gestion control algorithms to the dramatic packet loss occurred
along the end-to-end Internet paths (i.e., buffer overflow on the
routers). One possible solution is mobile edge computing (MEC), i.e.,
deploying edge caches and servers closer to users (e.g., just behind
base stations), and thus alleviating the problem of insufficient band-
width along the end-to-end paths. For instance, bandwidth-hungry
edge applications like UHD video playback or the more interac-
tive AR/VR can use a MEC platform to offload massive data traffic,
thereby reducing core network pressure and application-level la-
tency. However, there are also end-to-end applications (e.g., remote
robotic surgery [92], video telephony [96]), for which edge comput-
ing is not very helpful, and their performance relies on sufficient
bandwidth along the entire end-to-end Internet path. Therefore, to
fully unleash the 5G potential, other components of the 5G ecosys-
tem (e.g., wireline paths, upper-layer protocols) need to co-evolve
with the edge side of 5G, i.e., radio access architecture and also
MEC.
9 CONCLUSION
We perform a full-fledged, end-to-end measurement study span-
ning multiple interacting networking layers, on one of the first
commercial 5G networks, focusing on network coverage, end-to-
end throughput and delay, applications performance as well as en-
ergy consumption. Our measurement reveals imperative issues that
hamper the performance of 5G. Some of these problems (e.g., sur-
prisingly low bandwidth utilization) can be solved through proper
network resource provisioning or more intelligent protocol adap-
tation, but others (e.g., long latency and high power consumption)
entail long-term co-evolution of 5G with the legacy Internet infras-
tructure and radio/computing hardware. Our measurement insights
point to feasible directions to optimize 5G as an ecosystem to meet
the demanding application requirements.
