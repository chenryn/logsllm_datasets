below, is the following: If the observer, given an essential

candidate i or j, the best strategy for the observer is to opt
for i, if ρ ∈ MS

Fig. 3. Level of privacy (the smaller δ the higher privacy) for the considered
variants of ThreeBallot with two candidates, p0 = 0.3, p1 = 0.35, p2 = 0.35.
While the representation of δ S
Priv is the same for every
instantiation (except that the deﬁnitions of essential views
differ), the proofs of Theorem 4 for the various instantiations
differ signiﬁcantly. In each case, we ﬁrst show that the view
of the observer can indeed be reduced to the corresponding
essential view, and then, by combinatorial arguments, we show
that δ S
Priv is optimal. Due to space limitations, we do not
present this proof here.
For every S ∈ S , we have developed concrete formulas for
ASρ,i, which, in some cases, involved non-trivial combinatorial
reasoning. These formulas allowed us to compute concrete
values for δ S
Priv, as depicted in Figure 3 for the case of two
candidates. Note that election results are often published per
polling station, with just a few hundred voters each.
As can be seen from Figure 3, the variants of the protocols
where the observer does not get to see receipts of voters
provide the ideal level of privacy. The privacy enhanced variant
of VAV with receipts being revealed is ideal too: Intuitively, the
reason for this is that the receipts taken by the honest voters are
picked independently of the chosen candidates. Furthermore,
the bulletin board does not leak any information about how
a given voter voted, except for the bare result—the ballots of
type A and V which cancel out are chosen independently of
the voters’ choices. The variant of ThreeBallot by Marneffe
et al. is close to ideal. However, the level of privacy of the
original variant of ThreeBallot and the simple variant of VAV
is unacceptable. This is due to the receipts which, for these
variants of the protocols, leak a lot of information about a
vote. In case of VAV, for example, it is easy to see that with
probability 1
3, a voter takes the simple ballot as a receipt which
exactly shows her choice, hence, δ can never drop below 1
3.
D. Coercion-Resistance of ThreeBallot and VAV
In this section, we analyze the level of coercion-resistance
provided by all variants of ThreeBallot and VAV described
in Sections III and IV. We note that the level of coercion-
resistance of the variant by Marneffe et al. [8] has already
been established in [18]. However, the results for VAV and
the one for the original variant of ThreeBallot are new.

As in the case of privacy, the presentation of the results
follows the same structure for all protocol variants, which
is why we again introduce the necessary terminology and
present the results “in parallel” for all these variants. For
coercion-resistance, we also use the notion of an essential view
(although deﬁned differently). In addition, we have to deﬁne
the goal of the coerced voter and the counter-strategy.
Modeling and security assumptions. We make the same
modeling and security assumptions as in the case of privacy
and consider the same set S of concrete instantiations.
The goal of the coerced voter. Our analysis is w.r.t. the
goal γi, for i ∈ {1, . . . ,k}, which is met if the coerced voter
votes for candidate i, in case she is instructed by the coercer
to vote for some candidate. Note that if the coerced voter is
not instructed to vote, she cannot vote, as this fact would be
observed by the coercer, who sees if the voter enters the voting
booth (forced-abstention attack). Recall that for ThreeBallot,
we assume k = 2.
Counter-strategy. We deﬁne the counter-strategy of the co-
erced voter for an instance S ∈ S as follows: The counter-
strategy coincides with the dummy strategy dum with one
exception: If the coerced voter is requested to ﬁll out her ballot
and cast it according to a certain pattern Z, then the coerced
voter will, instead, ﬁll out the ballot according to CS(Z,i), as
deﬁned next. (Recall that the goal of the coerced voter is to
vote for i.) We deﬁne CS(Z,i) to be Z, if the pattern Z forms a
valid vote for i. Otherwise, the deﬁnition of CS(Z,i) depends
on the protocol under consideration:
– ThreeBallot: We deﬁne CS(Z,i) in such a way that it yields
the same receipt as Z does. Moreover, it adjusts the two re-
maining ballots in such a way that the resulting multi-ballot
is a valid vote for candidate i. By this requirement, CS(Z,i)
is uniquely determined, except for two cases: CS((x
x),1)
and CS((o
x, x
o, x
o),2). In the former case, for instance, one can
take (x
x) or (x
o, o
o, x
o), or randomly pick one of the two,
possibly based on some further information. For these cases,
we deﬁne CS(Z,i) to choose one of the possible patterns
uniformly at random.
– VAV: Similarly as in the case for ThreeBallot, CS(Z,i) is
deﬁned in such a way that it yields the same receipt as Z
does. It adjusts the two remaining ballots in such a way
that the resulting multi-ballot is a valid vote for candidate i.
By this requirement, CS(Z,i) is uniquely determined, except
for the case where the coercer demands a V -receipt for
candidate i. In this case, one can mark an arbitrary candidate
on the remaining two ballots. We demand that CS(Z,i) then
marks candidate i also on the remaining ballots.

x, o
x, o
o, x
We use these strategies in the proof of Theorem 5. From the
proof of this theorem it follows that these counter-strategies
achieve the maximal level of coercion-resistance and, in this
sense, are optimal for the coerced voter.
Essential views. The essential view of the coercer is deﬁned
as follows:
– ThreeBallot: If the coercer can see the receipts of honest
voters, the essential view is deﬁned just like the essential
view of the observer in case of privacy (see Section VI-C),
except that it does not contain the receipt of the coerced
voter (as the coerced voter returns always the receipt
demanded by the coercer). If the coercer cannot see the
x, nx
o,
receipts, the essential view consists of the integers nx
and no
x , representing the numbers of the respective simple
ballots on the bulletin board.
– Privacy enhanced variant of VAV: Regardless of whether
the coercer can see the receipts or not, an essential view
of the coercer consists of two integers nA
j for each
candidate j, indicating the number of A- and V-ballots on
the bulletin board, respectively, with candidate j marked.
j and nV
– Simple variant of VAV: The essential view of the coercer
j and nV
consists of integers nA
j , for each candidate j, as
if the coercer can see the receipts,
deﬁned above and,
additionally, two integers rA
j , for each candidate
j, indicating the number of A- and V-ballots, respectively,
taken by the honest voters as receipts with candidate j
marked.
j and rV
By EV S we denote the set of all essential views of the coercer
for the instantiation S ∈ S .
Level of coercion-resistance. Let S ∈ S and ρ ∈ EV S. We
deﬁne ASρ,Z to be the probability that, in a run of S, the choices
made by the honest voters and the coerced voter result in
the essential view ρ, given that the coerced voter chooses the
pattern Z. The deﬁnition of the level of coercion-resistance,
δ , now follows the same idea as in the case of privacy. We

which involved non-trivial combinatorial arguments, but al-
lowed us to compute concrete values for δ S
CR, as depicted
in Figure 4 for the case of two candidates. To put these
values in context, we present also the corresponding values
for the variant of ThreeBallot and the ideal protocol studied
in [18]. As we can see in Figure 4, for each protocol, with the
exception of Pp+
VAV, the level of coercion-resistance is
VAV and Pp−
lower if the coercer can see the receipts. For Pp+
VAV
the level of coercion-resistance is the same. Intuitively, the
reason for this is that, in Pp+
VAV, the information printed on a
receipt is independent of the chosen candidate, which is also
VAV and Pp−
TB, but unlike Pp+
the case for Pp+
TB, no further information can
be derived from the receipt in conjunction with the bulletin
board. Altogether, under the same assumptions, VAV provides
a better level of coercion-resistance than ThreeBallot, but both
are still worse than the ideal protocol.
Some selected values for the multi-candidate case, namely
10 candidates, are depicted in Figure 5. To put these values
in context, we present also the corresponding values for the
ideal protocol and the variant of ThreeBallot by Marneffe et
al. as studied in [18]. We can see that the (privacy enhanced)
variant of VAV handles the case of multiple candidates much
better than ThreeBallot, which for 10 candidate basically does
not provide any coercion-resistance. (Recall that δ close to 1
means that the coercer can tell almost for sure whether the
