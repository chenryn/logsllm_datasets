### Bulletin Board and Ballot Counting

- **Bulletin Board and Ballot Counting**: The number of ballots and receipts can be easily computed.
- **Privacy-Enhanced Variant of VAV**: The essential view is simply the final result.
- **Simple Variant of VAV**: The essential view for an observer includes:
  1. Integers \( nA_j \) and \( nV_j \) for each candidate \( j \), indicating the number of A- and V-ballots on the bulletin board where candidate \( j \) is marked.
  2 . The receipt \( r \) of the voter under observation.
  3. Integers \( rA_j \) and \( rV_j \) indicating the number of A- and V-ballots, respectively, taken by honest voters as receipts where candidate \( j \) is marked.

We denote the set of all essential views of the observer for the instantiation \( S \in S \) as \( EV_S \).

### Level of Privacy

For an essential view \( \rho \in EV_S \) and a candidate \( i \), let \( AS_{\rho,i} \) denote the probability that, in a run of \( S \), the essential view of the observer is \( \rho \), given that the observed voter votes for \( i \). For \( i, j \in \{1, \ldots, k\} \), define \( MS = \{\rho \in EV_S : AS_{\rho,j} \leq AS_{\rho,i}\} \).

The intuition behind the definition of \( \delta \) is that if the observer, given an essential view \( \rho \), wants to decide whether the observed voter voted for candidate \( i \) or \( j \), the best strategy is to opt for \( i \) if \( \rho \in MS_{j,i} \), meaning the view is more likely if the voter voted for candidate \( i \).

The function representing the level of privacy in the instantiation \( S \in S \) is:

\[
\delta_S^{Priv}(n, k, p) = \max_{i, j=1, \ldots, k} \sum_{\rho \in MS_{j,i}} (AS_{\rho,i} - AS_{\rho,j})
\]

**Theorem 4**: Let \( S \in S \). The instantiation \( S \) achieves \( \delta_S^{Priv} \) privacy. Moreover, \( S \) does not achieve \( \delta < \delta_S^{Priv} \) privacy for any \( \delta < \delta_S^{Priv} \).

\[
\delta_S^{Priv} = \delta
\]

Figure 3: Level of privacy (the smaller \( \delta \) the higher privacy) for the considered variants of ThreeBallot with two candidates, \( p_0 = 0.3 \), \( p_1 = 0.35 \), \( p_2 = 0.35 \).

While the representation of \( \delta_S^{Priv} \) is the same for every instantiation (except that the definitions of essential views differ), the proofs of Theorem 4 for the various instantiations differ significantly. In each case, we first show that the view of the observer can indeed be reduced to the corresponding essential view, and then, by combinatorial arguments, we show that \( \delta_S^{Priv} \) is optimal. Due to space limitations, we do not present this proof here.

For every \( S \in S \), we have developed concrete formulas for \( AS_{\rho,i} \), which, in some cases, involved non-trivial combinatorial reasoning. These formulas allowed us to compute concrete values for \( \delta_S^{Priv} \), as depicted in Figure 3 for the case of two candidates. Note that election results are often published per polling station, with just a few hundred voters each.

As can be seen from Figure 3, the variants of the protocols where the observer does not get to see receipts of voters provide the ideal level of privacy. The privacy-enhanced variant of VAV with receipts being revealed is also ideal: intuitively, the reason for this is that the receipts taken by the honest voters are picked independently of the chosen candidates. Furthermore, the bulletin board does not leak any information about how a given voter voted, except for the bare result—the ballots of type A and V which cancel out are chosen independently of the voters’ choices. The variant of ThreeBallot by Marneffe et al. is close to ideal. However, the level of privacy of the original variant of ThreeBallot and the simple variant of VAV is unacceptable. This is due to the receipts which, for these variants of the protocols, leak a lot of information about a vote. In the case of VAV, for example, it is easy to see that with probability \( \frac{1}{3} \), a voter takes the simple ballot as a receipt which exactly shows her choice, hence, \( \delta \) can never drop below \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Coercion-Resistance of ThreeBallot and VAV

In this section, we analyze the level of coercion-resistance provided by all variants of ThreeBallot and VAV described in Sections III and IV. We note that the level of coercion-resistance of the variant by Marneffe et al. [8] has already been established in [18]. However, the results for VAV and the one for the original variant of ThreeBallot are new.

As in the case of privacy, the presentation of the results follows the same structure for all protocol variants, which is why we again introduce the necessary terminology and present the results "in parallel" for all these variants. For coercion-resistance, we also use the notion of an essential view (although defined differently). In addition, we have to define the goal of the coerced voter and the counter-strategy.

#### Modeling and Security Assumptions

We make the same modeling and security assumptions as in the case of privacy and consider the same set \( S \) of concrete instantiations.

#### Goal of the Coerced Voter

Our analysis is with respect to the goal \( \gamma_i \), for \( i \in \{1, \ldots, k\} \), which is met if the coerced voter votes for candidate \( i \), in case she is instructed by the coercer to vote for some candidate. Note that if the coerced voter is not instructed to vote, she cannot vote, as this fact would be observed by the coercer, who sees if the voter enters the voting booth (forced-abstention attack). Recall that for ThreeBallot, we assume \( k = 2 \).

#### Counter-Strategy

We define the counter-strategy of the coerced voter for an instance \( S \in S \) as follows: The counter-strategy coincides with the dummy strategy \( dum \) with one exception: If the coerced voter is requested to fill out her ballot and cast it according to a certain pattern \( Z \), then the coerced voter will, instead, fill out the ballot according to \( CS(Z, i) \), as defined next. (Recall that the goal of the coerced voter is to vote for \( i \).)

- **ThreeBallot**: We define \( CS(Z, i) \) in such a way that it yields the same receipt as \( Z \) does. Moreover, it adjusts the two remaining ballots in such a way that the resulting multi-ballot is a valid vote for candidate \( i \). By this requirement, \( CS(Z, i) \) is uniquely determined, except for two cases: \( CS((x, x), 1) \) and \( CS((o, x, o, x, o), 2) \). In the former case, for instance, one can take \( (x, x) \) or \( (x, o, o, o, x) \), or randomly pick one of the two, possibly based on some further information. For these cases, we define \( CS(Z, i) \) to choose one of the possible patterns uniformly at random.
- **VAV**: Similarly as in the case for ThreeBallot, \( CS(Z, i) \) is defined in such a way that it yields the same receipt as \( Z \) does. It adjusts the two remaining ballots in such a way that the resulting multi-ballot is a valid vote for candidate \( i \). By this requirement, \( CS(Z, i) \) is uniquely determined, except for the case where the coercer demands a V-receipt for candidate \( i \). In this case, one can mark an arbitrary candidate on the remaining two ballots. We demand that \( CS(Z, i) \) then marks candidate \( i \) also on the remaining ballots.

We use these strategies in the proof of Theorem 5. From the proof of this theorem, it follows that these counter-strategies achieve the maximal level of coercion-resistance and, in this sense, are optimal for the coerced voter.

#### Essential Views

- **ThreeBallot**: If the coercer can see the receipts of honest voters, the essential view is defined just like the essential view of the observer in the case of privacy (see Section VI-C), except that it does not contain the receipt of the coerced voter (as the coerced voter always returns the receipt demanded by the coercer). If the coercer cannot see the receipts, the essential view consists of the integers \( n_x \), \( n_o \), and \( n_{nx} \), representing the numbers of the respective simple ballots on the bulletin board.
- **Privacy-Enhanced Variant of VAV**: Regardless of whether the coercer can see the receipts or not, an essential view of the coercer consists of two integers \( nA_j \) and \( nV_j \) for each candidate \( j \), indicating the number of A- and V-ballots on the bulletin board, respectively, with candidate \( j \) marked.
- **Simple Variant of VAV**: The essential view of the coercer consists of integers \( nA_j \) and \( nV_j \) for each candidate \( j \), as defined above and, additionally, two integers \( rA_j \) and \( rV_j \) for each candidate \( j \), indicating the number of A- and V-ballots, respectively, taken by the honest voters as receipts with candidate \( j \) marked.

We denote the set of all essential views of the coercer for the instantiation \( S \in S \) as \( EV_S \).

#### Level of Coercion-Resistance

Let \( S \in S \) and \( \rho \in EV_S \). We define \( AS_{\rho, Z} \) to be the probability that, in a run of \( S \), the choices made by the honest voters and the coerced voter result in the essential view \( \rho \), given that the coerced voter chooses the pattern \( Z \). The definition of the level of coercion-resistance, \( \delta \), now follows the same idea as in the case of privacy. We define \( MS_Z \) to be the set of those essential views for which the coercer should accept the run and we define:

\[
\delta_S^{CR}(n, k, p) = \max_Z \sum_{\rho \in MS_Z} (AS_{\rho, Z} - AS_{\rho, C(Z, i)})
\]

**Theorem 5**: Let \( S \in S \). Then \( S \) is \( \delta_S^{CR} \)-coercion-resistant. Moreover, \( S \) is not \( \delta' \)-coercion-resistant for any \( \delta' < \delta_S^{CR} \).

Similar to the case of privacy, the details of the proofs for the different variants \( S \) of the protocols differ significantly. Due to lack of space, we omit the proofs in this extended abstract.

We developed concrete formulas for \( AS_{\rho, i} \) and \( AS_{\rho, C(Z, i)} \), which involved non-trivial combinatorial arguments but allowed us to compute concrete values for \( \delta_S^{CR} \), as depicted in Figure 4 for the case of two candidates. To put these values in context, we present also the corresponding values for the variant of ThreeBallot and the ideal protocol studied in [18].

As we can see in Figure 4, for each protocol, with the exception of \( Pp+_{VAV} \), the level of coercion-resistance is lower if the coercer can see the receipts. For \( Pp+_{VAV} \) and \( Pp-_{VAV} \), the level of coercion-resistance is the same. Intuitively, the reason for this is that, in \( Pp+_{VAV} \), the information printed on a receipt is independent of the chosen candidate, which is also the case for \( Pp+_{TB} \), but unlike \( Pp+_{TB} \), no further information can be derived from the receipt in conjunction with the bulletin board. Altogether, under the same assumptions, VAV provides a better level of coercion-resistance than ThreeBallot, but both are still worse than the ideal protocol.

Some selected values for the multi-candidate case, namely 10 candidates, are depicted in Figure 5. To put these values in context, we present also the corresponding values for the ideal protocol and the variant of ThreeBallot by Marneffe et al. as studied in [18]. We can see that the (privacy-enhanced) variant of VAV handles the case of multiple candidates much better than ThreeBallot, which for 10 candidates basically does not provide any coercion-resistance. (Recall that \( \delta \) close to 1 means that the coercer can tell almost for sure whether the voter followed the instructions.)
