Question: "Your organization is considering upgrading its security devices and is comparing Type II and Type III devices as defined by the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The finance department argues that Type III devices, being the most secure option should be chosen, regardless of cost. Which of the following statements provides the best counterargument to the finance department's claim?"
 "A": "Type III devices are tamper-resistant, making them the only suitable option for high-security requirements."
 "B": "Type II devices are designed to be tamper-evident, which allows for detection of security breaches and is a cost-effective solution for a broader array of applications."
 "C": "Implementing Type II devices would be irresponsible as they do not provide any form of security against tampering."
 "D": "The organization should focus solely on preventive measures and not invest in detection or response capabilities."
