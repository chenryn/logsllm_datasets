## Prerequisites
Before starting the investigation, make sure you have completed the setup for logs and alerts and other system requirements.
For Microsoft Entra monitoring, follow our recommendations and guidance in our [Microsoft Entra SecOps Guide](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/security-operations-introduction).
### Set up [AD FS logging](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/troubleshooting/ad-fs-tshoot-logging)
#### Event logging on ADFS 2016
By default, the Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) in Windows Server 2016 has a basic level of auditing enabled. With basic auditing, administrators can see five or less events for a single request. Set logging to the highest level and send the AD FS (& security) logs to a SIEM to correlate with AD authentication and Microsoft Entra ID.
To view the current auditing level, use this PowerShell command:
```powershell
Get-AdfsProperties
```
![Example of the Get-AdfsProperties PowerShell command](./media/incident-response-playbook-password-spray/adfsproperties.png)
This table lists the auditing levels that are available.
|Audit level|PowerShell syntax|Description|
|---|---|---|
|None|`Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel None`|Auditing is disabled and no events will be logged|
|Basic (Default)|`Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel Basic`|No more than five events will be logged for a single request|
|Verbose|`Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel Verbose`|All events will be logged. This level will log a significant amount of information per request.|
To raise or lower the auditing level, use this PowerShell command:
```powershell
Set-AdfsProperties -AuditLevel 
```
### Set up ADFS 2012 R2/2016/2019 security logging
1. Click **Start**, navigate to **Programs &gt; Administrative Tools**, and then click **Local Security Policy**.
2. Navigate to the **Security Settings\\Local Policies\\User Rights Management** folder, and then double-click **Generate security audits**.
3. On the **Local Security Setting** tab, verify that the ADFS service account is listed. If it isn't present, click **Add User** or **Group** and add it to the list, and then click **OK**.
4. To enable auditing, open a command prompt with elevated privileges and run the following command:
    ```DOS
    auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:"Application Generated" /failure:enable /success:enable
    ```
5. Close **Local Security Policy**.
6. Next, open the ADFS Management snap-in, click **Start**, navigate to **Programs > Administrative Tools**, and then click **ADFS Management**.
7. In the **Actions** pane, click **Edit Federation Service Properties**.
8. In the **Federation Service Properties** dialog box, click the **Events** tab.
9. Select the **Success audits** and **Failure audits** check boxes.
10. Click **OK** to finish and save the configuration.
### Install Microsoft Entra Connect Health for ADFS
The Microsoft Entra Connect Health for ADFS agent allows you to have greater visibility into your federation environment. It provides you with several preconfigured dashboards like usage, performance monitoring and risky IP reports.
To install ADFS Connect Health, go through the [requirements for using Microsoft Entra Connect Health](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-agent-install#requirements), and then install the [Azure ADFS Connect Health Agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=518973).
### Set up risky IP alerts using the [ADFS Risky IP Report Workbook](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-adfs-risky-ip-workbook#:~:text=The%20risky%20IP%20workbook%20analyzes%20data%20from%20ADFSSignInLogs,on%20designated%20error%20thresholds%20and%20detection%20window%20length.)
After Microsoft Entra Connect Health for ADFS is configured, you should monitor and set up alerting using the ADFS Risky IP report workbook and Azure Monitor. The benefits of using this report are:
- Detection of IP addresses that exceed a threshold of failed password-based logins.
- Supports failed logins due to bad password or due to extranet lockout state.
- Supports enabling alerts through Azure Alerts.
- Customizable threshold settings that match with the security policy of an organization.
- Customizable queries and expanded visualizations for further analysis.
- Expanded functionality from the previous Risky IP report, which is deprecated as of January 24, 2022.
### Set up SIEM tool alerts on Microsoft Sentinel
To set up SIEM tool alerts, go through the tutorial on [out of the box alerting](/azure/sentinel/tutorial-detect-threats-built-in).
### SIEM integration into Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
Connect the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, which currently supports Micro Focus ArcSight and generic common event format (CEF).
For more information, see [Generic SIEM Integration](/cloud-app-security/siem).
### SIEM integration with Graph API
You can connect SIEM with the Microsoft Graph Security API by using any of the following options:
- **Directly using the supported integration options** – Refer to the list of supported integration options like writing code to directly connect your application to derive rich insights. Use samples to get started.
- **Use native integrations and connectors built by Microsoft partners** – Refer to the Microsoft Graph Security API partner solutions to use these integrations.
- **Use connectors built by Microsoft** – Refer to the list of connectors that you can use to connect with the API through various solutions for Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM), Security Response and Orchestration (SOAR), Incident Tracking and Service Management (ITSM), reporting, and so on.
For more information, see [Security solution integrations using the Microsoft Graph Security API](/graph/security-integration#list-of-connectors-from-microsoft).
### Using Splunk
You can also use the Splunk platform to set up alerts.
- Watch this video tutorial on how to create [Splunk alerts](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/videos/splunk-tutorial-creating-alerts-in-splunk-enterprise-6.html).
- For more information, see [Splunk alerting manual](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.4/Alert/AlertWorkflowOverview).

## Checklist
### Investigation triggers
- Received a trigger from SIEM, firewall logs, or Microsoft Entra ID
- Microsoft Entra ID Protection Password Spray feature or Risky IP
- Large number of failed sign-ins (Event ID 411)
- Spike in Microsoft Entra Connect Health for ADFS
- Another security incident (for example, phishing)
- Unexplained activity, such as a sign-in from unfamiliar location or a user getting unexpected MFA prompts
### Investigation
- What is being alerted?
- Can you confirm this attack is a password spray?
- Determine timeline for attack.
- Determine the IP address(es) of the attack.
- Filter on successful sign-ins for this time period and IP address, including successful password but failed MFA
- Check [MFA reporting](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-reporting)
- Is there anything out of the ordinary on the account, such as new device, new OS, new IP address used? Use Defender for Cloud Apps or Azure Information Protection to detect suspicious activity.
- Inform local authorities/third parties for assistance.
- If you suspect a compromise, check for data exfiltration.
- Check associated account for suspicious behavior and look to correlate to other possible accounts and services as well as other malicious IP addresses.
- Check accounts of anyone working in the same office/delegated access - password hygiene (make sure they aren't using the same password as the compromised account)
- Run ADFS help
#### Mitigations
Check the [References](#references) section for guidance on how to enable the following features:
- [Block IP address of attacker](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication) (keep an eye out for changes to another IP address)

## Investigation steps
### Password spray incident response
Let's understand a few password spray attack techniques before proceeding with the investigation.
**Password compromise:** An attacker guessed the user's password but hasn't been able to access the account due to other controls such as multifactor authentication (MFA).
**Account compromise:** An attacker guessed the user's password and gained access to the account.
### Environment discovery
#### Identify authentication type
As the first step, you need to check what authentication type is used for a tenant/verified domain that you're investigating.
To obtain the authentication status for a specific domain name, use the [Get-MgDomain](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.directorymanagement/get-mgdomain) PowerShell command. Here's an example:
