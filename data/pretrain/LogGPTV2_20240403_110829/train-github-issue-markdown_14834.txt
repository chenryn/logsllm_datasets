##### Detailed description
I found that cv2.VideoCapture() costs different CPU utilization in Windows and
in Ubuntu.  
I ran the following code in Windows and in Ubuntu respectively, it costs 25%
CPU utilization in Windows and more than 80% CPU utilization costed in Ubuntu.
Why it makes such big difference? Both OSs are run in a same machine, the only
difference is the OS. So I guess is there some dependency libs I missed in the
Ubuntu OS?
       cam = cv2.VideoCapture('rtmp://192.168.1.29:9935/live/0')
       while True:
               ret, frame = cam.read()
               frame = cv2.resize(frame, (960,540))
