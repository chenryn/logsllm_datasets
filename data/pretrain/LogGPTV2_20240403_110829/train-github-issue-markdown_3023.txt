#### Describe the bug
When using an imputer, after training on a data frame with at least one of the
columns completely missing, the imputer will drop this feature after a
transform.
I would expect at least a warning or an option to fall back to a constant
value fill.
#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
    df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1,2,3],'b':[None,None,None]})
    print(SimpleImputer().fit_transform(df).shape)
#### Expected Results
(3, 2)
#### Actual Results
(3, 1)
