User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the storage.BlockManager finding blocks rdd_2_1, rdd_2_2, and rdd_2_3 locally. The python.PythonRunner then records the total, boot, init, and finish times for each block. The executor.Executor then finishes tasks 0.0-4.0 in stage 10.0 and sends the results to the driver. Finally, the executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend assigns tasks 450, 464, 475, and 478 to the executor.Executor, which runs them in stage 11.0.
