Question: "A cybersecurity analyst is reviewing network traffic logs and notices multiple instances of data packets being transferred at regular intervals, all of the same size below the usual threshold that usually triggers alerts. The analyst suspects this could be a data exfiltration technique employed by an adversary. Which of the following best describes the adversary's likely strategy and a potential method to detect this activity?"
 "A": "The adversary is exfiltrating data in fixed size chunks to avoid triggering alerts, and the analyst should monitor for newly constructed network connections that send fixed size data packets at regular intervals."
 "B": "The adversary is using a standard file transfer method without alteration to evade detection, and the analyst should focus on the file metadata for anomalies."
 "C": "The adversary is likely encrypting the data to bypass size-based detection, and the analyst should examine SSL/TLS handshake inconsistencies to detect the exfiltration."
 "D": "The adversary is employing a fast flux DNS technique to rapidly change IP addresses associated with data transfers, and the analyst should look for anomalies in DNS traffic patterns."
Answer: A
