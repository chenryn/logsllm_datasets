CanActivate hooks are currently executed in order of child -> parent. This
causes problems when the child route's CanActivate depends on data that is set
by the parent's CanActivate. An example might be the checking of current user
permissions in the child CanActivate when the current user will not be
bootstrapped until the parent's CanActivate is called.
Is this by design? It would seem more logical to have this perform the way
OnActivate does (from parent -> child).
