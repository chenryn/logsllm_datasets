User:  company needs to implement a Redis cluster with high availability and scalability. Please design a reasonable architecture solution, including data synchronization, master-slave switching and monitoring mechanism.
Assistant: The architecture scheme is as follows: 1. Redis cluster data synchronization: use Redis's own replication mechanism, configure slave nodes on the master node, and automatically perform data synchronization. At the same time, RDB (snapshot) or AOF (log) persistence can be configured to ensure data reliability. 2. Master-slave switch: adopt the sentinel mode to monitor the status of the Redis master node, and quickly perform master-slave switch when the master node fails to ensure data availability. Sentinel mode requires at least three nodes, one of which is the master node and the other two are sentinel nodes. 3. Monitoring mechanism: Use monitoring tools such as Zabbix to monitor Redis clusters in real time, monitor performance indicators such as Redis nodes, CPU, memory, and network, and alarm and deal with abnormal situations. 4. Scalability. By expanding the cluster horizontally in a balanced manner, a Redis cluster with multiple nodes is formed to improve the Redis service load capacity. The cluster can be expanded by adding nodes. The above is a reasonable Redis cluster solution, which needs to be adjusted and optimized according to actual business needs and specific application scenarios.
