### Create Microsoft Reserved (MSR) Partition

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
This command creates a Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition on a GUID Partition Table (GPT) disk. An MSR partition is required on every GPT disk. The size of the MSR partition depends on the total size of the GPT disk, and the disk must be at least 32 MB in size to create an MSR partition.

**Important:**
Exercise extreme caution when using this command. Because GPT disks require a specific partition layout, creating an MSR partition can render the disk unreadable if not done correctly.

**Prerequisites:**
- A basic GPT disk must be selected for this operation to succeed.
- Use the `select disk` command to select a basic GPT disk and shift the focus to it.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
create partition msr [size=<size>] [offset=<offset>] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **size=**  
  Specifies the size of the partition in megabytes (MB). The partition will be at least as large as the specified size. If no size is given, the partition will continue until there is no more free space in the current region.

- **offset=**  
  Specifies the offset in kilobytes (KB) at which the partition is created. The offset is rounded up to completely fill whatever sector size is used. If no offset is given, the partition is placed in the first disk extent that is large enough to hold it.

- **noerr**  
  For scripting purposes only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Remarks:**
- On GPT disks used to boot the Windows operating system, the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) system partition is the first partition on the disk, followed by the MSR partition.
- GPT disks used only for data storage do not have an EFI system partition; in such cases, the MSR partition is the first partition.
- Windows does not mount MSR partitions, and you cannot store data on them or delete them.

**Examples:**
To create an MSR partition of 1000 megabytes in size, type:
```plaintext
create partition msr size=1000
```

This command will create an MSR partition of 1000 MB on the currently selected GPT disk.
