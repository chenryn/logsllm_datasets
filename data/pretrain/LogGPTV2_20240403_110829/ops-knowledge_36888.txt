User: Recently I installed wxPython to do some works under Windows. Most of the time I work in Linux so I have a little experience here. 
with python.exe interpreter, I just do 2 line of codeimport wxtmp=wx.App(False)
Then the interpreter crashed with Windows error reporting.
I tried both python 2.7.1 and 2.6.6  with wxPython 2.8.11, all come from their main website, still no luck.
Is there something I must do after install Python in Windows ? I can see that python install just fine and can do some basic job, wxPython library can be load, but can't call wx.App
Assistant: I searched for a while and found that this is the problem with wxPython and Python >2.5. Tried many fix with manyfest file but no luck, so I think switch to PyQt is the only solution now.
