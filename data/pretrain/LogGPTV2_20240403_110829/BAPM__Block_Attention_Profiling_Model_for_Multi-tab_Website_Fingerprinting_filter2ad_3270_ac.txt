### 6.1 Analysis of Multi-Tab WF Attack Results

Previous studies on multi-tab website fingerprinting (WF) attacks have shown that the second page is generally more challenging to distinguish than the first page. According to [6], this difficulty arises because the initial part of a packet trace is crucial for classification. However, for all pages after the first, the beginning segments are overlapped with the previous page, complicating the classification process. This overlap is particularly problematic for PSP-WF, which removes the overlapping area, leading to a decline in performance, especially for the second page. The accuracy of predicting the second splitting point drops by approximately 30%, making it more likely for the second page to be incorrectly split and affecting subsequent classification results.

### 6.2 Ablation Analysis

To address the challenges in multi-tab packet traces, BAPM (Block Attention Profiling Model) incorporates two key components: block division and attention-based profiling. We conducted ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of these components. The comparison models include full BAPM, BAPM without block division, and BAPM without multi-head attention. Figures 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c) display three evaluation metrics, with solid lines representing the first page and dotted lines representing the second page.

**Comparison with Block Division:**
The results show that block division significantly improves the classification performance, particularly for the second page, with an improvement of about 10%. This is because block division effectively utilizes the overlapping area, which is crucial for the second page's classification. Figure 5(d) illustrates the accuracy improvements, where the first page shows minimal improvement under 10% overlap but a 3% increase under 50% overlap, indicating that block division's benefits are more pronounced with larger overlapping areas.

**Comparison with Multi-Head Attention:**
The attention mechanism in BAPM doubles the performance metrics for the first page and shows even more significant improvements for the second page. Without the attention mechanism, BAPM would degrade into a simple multi-label classifier like Multi-DF, and the block division would lose its effectiveness. The attention distribution, visualized in Figure 6, confirms that the first head focuses on the initial part of the first page, while the second head focuses on the latter part of the second page, highlighting the importance of the overlapping area.

### 6.3 Sensitivity Analysis

Given the black-box nature of deep learning methods, we performed sensitivity analysis by tuning critical parameters and observing the results. In BAPM, the tab-aware feature representation is divided into blocks to preserve local directional patterns. The number of blocks \( N \) determines the granularity of the attention mechanism. We conducted experiments with block numbers ranging from 1 to 512, setting the overlapping proportion to 50%.

**Results:**
- **Block Number Impact:** All three evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, and recall) improve initially and then deteriorate as the block number increases, indicating that both too small and too large block numbers are detrimental. An effective block number range is between 4 and 128, with 16 being the optimal value.
- **Model Size:** The model size follows a similar trend, decreasing and then increasing with the block number. The optimal block number (16) also corresponds to the most cost-effective model, balancing strong classification ability with low computational complexity.

### 6.4 Results on Three-Tab Packet Traces

Table 4 presents the classification results for three-tab packet traces with a uniform 10% overlapping proportion. BAPM outperforms other models across all three tabs, demonstrating better robustness as the number of tabs increases. The first tab has the best results due to the undisturbed beginning part, while the middle tab, which is mixed with two other tabs, is the most challenging to classify.

### 6.5 Results on Open World Packet Traces

We evaluated BAPM's performance in an open-world setting, where non-monitored websites are included in both training and testing sets. We selected 2000, 4000, and 6000 non-monitored websites randomly, with class number ratios of 40:1, 80:1, and 120:1, respectively. For each trace, we first predict whether it belongs to a monitored website and then classify it if it does. The results under different scales of non-monitored websites are discussed in detail in the following sections.
