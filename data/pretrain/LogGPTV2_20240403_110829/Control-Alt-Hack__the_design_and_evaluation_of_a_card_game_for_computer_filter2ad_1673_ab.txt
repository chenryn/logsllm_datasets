### Skills and Missions in Control-Alt-Hack

In the game, players can use their technical skills to disrupt a region's power grid or apply hardware hacking and software wizardry to transform a robotic vacuum cleaner into an interactive pet toy. No two jobs are the same, so pick up the dice and start hacking!

### Balancing Enjoyment and Educational Content

To ensure the game remains enjoyable, not all cards focus solely on computer security topics. Figures 1, 2, and 3 showcase the game box, contents, and some of the card designs. Each turn, players attempt a single Mission, allowing them to experience a variety of scenarios throughout the game. By incorporating a wide range of technologies and security threats into the Mission narratives, we communicate a broad spectrum of security concepts.

### Juggling Design Constraints

Our game creation process was guided by several goals and constraints, sometimes in direct conflict. Finding optimal solutions or pleasing compromises required significant effort and iteration.

#### 3.4.1 Textual Content

In creating the cards' textual content, we balanced multiple objectives:
1. **Including Technical Content:** We began by listing the content needed to address our Awareness Goals and convey the breadth and depth of computer security issues. This included brainstorming lists of technologies, attacks, defenses, attacker types, and human assets affected by system breaches. Table 7 in the Appendix (Section A.1) provides sample card titles and topics, along with examples of specific research that inspired their inclusion. We aimed for topics relevant and interesting to players through personal, educational, professional, or media experiences.
   
   - **Feedback Process:** During this phase, we solicited feedback on the selection and technical accuracy of the content (Section 3.2).

   - **Content Balance:** Of the 56 Mission cards, 44 deal directly with security topics, 6 with technological activities (as in Figure 3a), and the remaining 6 cover related topics like puzzles, the role of computer security in history, or the value of professional networking.

2. **Mapping Game Mechanics:** The characters, their skills, and the Missions in Control-Alt-Hack are isomorphic to those in Ninja Burger to maintain game balance. Significant iteration and exploration were necessary to create realistic and fun story justifications for the skill combinations required for all 56 Missions. For example, the Mission "Shock Value" in Figure 3(c) required inventing an attack needing Social Engineering and Network Ninja skills, along with a mapping from the original Ninja Burger card. Similar efforts were made for the game’s 72 Entropy cards and 16 Hacker cards.

3. **Offering Comprehensibility:** Given our target audience (Section 2.3), our goal of generating enthusiasm for computer security and computer science (Perception Goals), and our desire to reach a broad audience (Exposure Goal), we needed to make the text understandable to those without extensive security experience, without sacrificing technical integrity. We aimed to make the meaning of terms implicitly clear, explicitly clear, or irrelevant to understanding the overall gist of the card. For instance, "Shock Value" in Figure 3(c) defines an IP address as an Internet address, and "Dumpster Diving" in Figure 3(b) defines dumpster diving within the card text. This card also illustrates that defensive measures (guards, in this case) are not always effective and that attackers can be surprisingly creative (e.g., renting a garbage truck).

4. **Incorporating Humor:** To enhance enjoyment, we incorporated humor primarily through puns, popular culture references, and tasteful, respectful sexual innuendo. We evaluated the cards with stakeholder groups before finalizing them (Section 3.2). For example, "Shock Value" in Figure 4(c) includes puns, and "eTextiles" in Figure 3(a) has a popular culture reference in its Hardware Hacking task.

### Visual Design

We directed illustration and graphic design as part of the game’s content creation process, allocating significant resources to visuals for two reasons:
1. **Character Identification:** To help players identify with and project themselves onto Hacker characters (Perception Goals).
2. **Visual Appeal:** To make the game visually appealing, attracting more players (Exposure Goal) and showing that a focus on technology does not preclude aesthetics (Perception Goals).

In creating Hacker portraits, we balanced the characters’ genders and ethnicities and showed them engaging in various hobbies. Figure 2 displays the character art from the portrait side of 12 of the 16 Hacker cards.

### Distribution, Exposure, and Preliminary Impact

To reach a diverse audience (Exposure Goal), we made Control-Alt-Hack available via two avenues:
1. **Free for Educators:** Available for free to educators who submit a request via http://www.controlalthack.com. As of July 2013, the supply allocated to educators was nearly depleted.
2. **For Sale on Amazon:** Available for sale on Amazon.com via RGB Hats, LLC, founded by two co-authors and licensed from the University of Washington. This method allows for self-sustaining production.

From November through March, we shipped approximately 800 copies of the game to 150 different educators who requested copies. About 50 copies were distributed at the SIGCSE 2013 poster session. These educators served as the recruitment pool for our summative evaluation of the game (Section 6).

### Positive Functions and Critiques

- **Social/Engagement:** The game fosters social interaction and engagement.
- **Awareness:** It raises awareness about various security threats and concepts.
- **Critiques:** Some users noted that it takes a long time to learn.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the game is both educational and entertaining, making it a valuable tool for teaching computer security and computer science.
