enjoyability, we intentionally did not want all of the cards to focus 
on computer security topics. 
Figure 1 shows the game box and contents. Figures 2 and 3 show 
some of the game art and card contents.  
Each turn each player attempts a single Mission, so players get to 
see a number of Missions throughout the course of the game. By 
incorporating a large number of technologies and security threats 
into the Mission narratives, we communicate a variety of security 
ideas throughout the course of the game. 
3.4  Juggling Design Constraints  
Our  game  creation  process  was  driven  by  goals  and  constraints, 
some occasionally in direct conflict; seeking optimal solutions (or 
pleasing compromises) took significant effort and iteration. 
3.4.1  Text 
In  creating  the  cards’  textual  content,  we  balanced  a  number  of 
goals  and  restrictions:  (1)  Including  Technical  Content;  (2) 
Mapping  Game  Mechanics;  (3)  Offering  Comprehensibility;  (4) 
Maintaining Brevity; and (5) Incorporating Humor. 
Including Technical Content. We began by creating a list of the 
content  we  wanted  to  cover  in  order  to  address  our  Awareness 
Goals  and  convey  the  range  and  depth  of  computer  security 
issues:  we  brainstormed  lists  of  technologies,  attacks,  defenses, 
attacker types, and the range of human assets that can be impacted 
by system breaches. Table 7 in the Appendix (Section A.1) gives 
some  sample  card  titles  and  topics,  along  with  examples  of 
specific  research  that  inspired  their  inclusion.  We  sought  topics 
that would be relevant and interesting to players through personal 
(e.g.,  social  networks),  educational  (e.g.,  browser  cookies),  or 
professional  experience  (e.g.,  patching)  or  through  the  news  and 
media  (e.g.,  credit  card  theft).  During  the  Feedback  Process 
(Section 3.2), we solicited feedback on the selection and technical 
accuracy of the content which we portrayed. 
Most of the game relates to computer security: of the 56 Mission 
cards,  44  deal  directly  with  security  topics,  6  with  technological 
activities (as in Figure 3a), and the remaining 6 deal with related 
topics like puzzles, the role of computer security in history, or the 
value  of  professional  networking.  For  content  balance  and 
Mapping Game Mechanics. The  characters, their skills, and  the 
Missions—which require the use of various combinations of those 
skills—in  Control-Alt-Hack  are  isomorphic  to  those  in  Ninja 
Burger  in  order  to  preserve  game  balance.  Significant  iteration 
and exploration was required to create reasonably realistic and fun 
story  justifications  for  the  combinations  of  skills  required  for  all 
56 Missions. See the Mission “Shock Value” in Figure 3(c) for an 
example  where  it  was  necessary  to  invent  an  attack  requiring 
Social  Engineering  and  Network  Ninja  skills,  along  with  a 
mapping  from  the  original  Ninja  Burger  card.  Similar  effort  was 
required to create content for the game’s 72 Entropy cards and 16 
Hacker cards. 
Offering Comprehensibility. Given our target audience (Section 
2.3),  our  goal  of  creating  enthusiasm  for  computer  security  and 
computer  science  (Perception  Goals),  and  our  desire  to  reach  a 
broad  audience  (Exposure  Goal),  we  needed  to  make  our  text 
understandable  to  those  without  extensive  security  experience—
without  sacrificing  technical  integrity.  We  attempted  to  always 
make  the  meaning  of  terms  implicitly  clear,  explicitly  clear,  or 
irrelevant  to  understanding  the  overall  gist  of  the  card.  For 
example, “Shock Value” in Figure 3(c) parenthetically defines an 
IP  address  as  an  Internet  address,  and  “Dumpster  Diving”  in 
Figure 3(b) defines dumpster diving within the text of the card.   
Observe how this latter card also incorporates additional learning 
content: the card helps illustrate that defensive measures (guards, 
in  this  case)  are  not  always  effective,  and  that  the  creativity  of 
attackers can be surprising (such as renting a garbage truck, which 
many people may not have thought possible). 
Incorporating Humor. We incorporated humor into the game in 
order  to  make  it  more  enjoyable.  The  humor  primarily  (but  not 
exclusively)  took  the  form  of:  (1)  puns;  (2)  popular  culture 
references; or (3) sexual innuendo, although we attempted to keep 
the  innuendo  tasteful  and  respectful,  and  we  evaluated  the  cards 
with stakeholder groups prior to finalizing them (Section 3.2). For 
example, “Shock Value” in Figure 4(c) has puns, and “eTextiles” 
in  Figure  3(a)  has  a  popular  culture  reference  in  its  Hardware 
Hacking task.

3.4.2  Visuals 
We directed illustration and graphic design as part of the game’s 
content  creation  process.  We  purposefully  allocated  a  non-trivial 
portion  of  our  resources  to  these  visuals  for  two  reasons:  (a)  to 
make it easier for players to identify with and project themselves 
onto  Hacker  characters  (Perception  Goals);  and  (b)  to  make  the 
game  visually  appealing,  hopefully  attracting  players  (Exposure

Goal) and implicitly showing that a focus on technology does not 
preclude placing importance on aesthetics (Perception Goals). 
In  creating  Hacker  portraits,  we  addressed  the  Perception  and 
Exposure  Goals  by  balancing  the  characters’  genders  and 
ethnicities and by showing them engaging in a variety of hobbies.

4.  DISTRIBUTION, EXPOSURE, AND 
PRELIMINARY IMPACT  
In order to  reach a  diverse set  of audiences (Exposure Goal), we 
chose  to  make  Control-Alt-Hack  available  via  two  different 
avenues: 
(1)  Available  for  free  to  educators  who  submit  a  request  via 
http://www.controlalthack.com.  As  of  July  2013,  the  supply 
of games allocated to educators has been nearly depleted. 
(2)  Available  for  sale  on  Amazon.com  via  RGB  Hats,  LLC, 
which  was  founded  by  two  of  the  co-authors  and  which 
licensed  the  game  from  the  University  of  Washington.  This 
distribution method also allows production of the game to be 
self-sustaining. 
From  when  the  game  was  made  available  in  November  through 
March, we shipped approximately 800 copies of the game to 150 
different  educators  who  requested  copies.  Approximately  50 
copies were also handed out  at the SIGCSE  2013 poster  session. 
Together,  these  educators  served  as  the  recruitment  pool  for  our 
summative evaluation of the game (Section 6). Additionally, over
