User: I have a python gui that access files on windows as C:\data and C:\MyDIR all outside my doc's.
On, a linux sys i created /data and /MyDIR.
My gui cant access. I foresee always using C:\data and C:\MyDIR on both systems.  
How do I fix code or Linux permissions to have access to both dir and sub directories.
Assistant: Where did you create those directories in your Linux? Under $HOME? You can determine your path separator using the string 'sep' from the os module, that is, os.sep, then acct according to its return value. Comes to my mind sth like:
import os
dirs = [os.sep + "data", os.sep + "MyDIR"]
But all depends on what you want to do. If you can, please explain further your needs.
