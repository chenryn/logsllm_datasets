Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-clockwise-
notation-to-specify-the-margin-of-an-element has an issue. Please describe how
to reproduce it, and include links to screenshots if possible.
Last paragraph of instructions reads: "Use Clockwise Notation to give _an
element_ a margin of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its
bottom and right side."
But only changing the margin of the green box validates. So the sentence
should be changed to: "Use Clockwise Notation to give _the green box_ a margin
of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side."
