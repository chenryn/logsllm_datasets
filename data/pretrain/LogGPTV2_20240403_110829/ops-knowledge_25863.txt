It appears that the issue you're encountering with `pip` is due to spaces in the Python installation path. To resolve this without having to reinstall Python in a path without spaces, you can follow these steps:

In my case, the problem arose when I updated the environment path to point to Python 2.7, which was previously set to Python 3.6. After this change, to execute `pip` or `virtualenv` commands, I had to use the `-m` flag with Python, as in `python -m pip install <package_name>`, as suggested in other answers.

To permanently fix this, I re-ran the Python 2.7 installer, selected the "Change" option, and ensured that the "Add Python to PATH" option was checked. Once the installation process completed, everything worked as expected.
