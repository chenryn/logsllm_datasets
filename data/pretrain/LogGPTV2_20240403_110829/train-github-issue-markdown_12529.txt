# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
A monitor edge management screen to virtually link monitor edges to allow the
mouse to flow from one to another. Currently available program called
littlebigmouse isn't the most reliable and is no longer active. When it works
it is extremely smooth. I have 4 monitors setup and from left to right I want
to be able to go from one monitor to either middle monitor back to one
monitor. The default windows setup is extremely annoying because when moving
from the middle top to the far left monitor you always get stuck on an edge.
This combined with fancy zones is a very smooth experience.

The UI for littlebigmouse conceptually makes a lot of sense. It unfortunately
is very difficult to get setup due to a busy screen and hard to control
interface.
