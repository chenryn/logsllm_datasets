Running Glide 3.3.1 on a pre-11 device will throw
    E/dalvikvmï¹• Could not find class 'android.app.FragmentManager', referenced from method
    com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.handleMessage
As README.md states: Glide requires a minimum sdk version of 10, I think Glide
should handle this gracefully.
Thanks
