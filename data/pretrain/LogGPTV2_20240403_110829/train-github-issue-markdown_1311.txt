When running Glide 3.3.1 on a device with an Android version lower than 11, the following error is thrown:

```
E/dalvikvm: Could not find class 'android.app.FragmentManager', referenced from method com.bumptech.glide.manager.RequestManagerRetriever.handleMessage
```

According to the `README.md` file, Glide requires a minimum SDK version of 10. However, it would be more graceful if Glide could handle this incompatibility issue more effectively.

Thank you.
