The issue is related to using the 'navbar' in smalll devices (320x480).
The 'navbar-fixed-top' cannot be scrolled down to the bottom of 'navbar-
collapse' div.
This can easily be reproduced in the jumbotron sample page:
http://getbootstrap.com/examples/jumbotron/.
After fitting the page to a small device (320x480), when you press on the
'navbar-toggle' button, then the scroll bar cannot reach the "email" &
"password" elements.
Thanks!
