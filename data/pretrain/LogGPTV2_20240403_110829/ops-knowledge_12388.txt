Certainly! Here's a more professional and clear version of the text:

**Original:**
```
Confirm the mode of this log. Connecting to ResourceManager at msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030
Assistant: Connecting to ResourceManager at <*>/<*>:<*>
```

**Optimized:**
```
Please confirm the log mode. Establishing connection to the ResourceManager at msra-sa-41 (IP: 10.190.173.170) on port 8030.

Response: 
Connecting to the ResourceManager at <hostname>/<IP>:<port>.
```

In this optimized version, the instructions are clearer, and the placeholders for sensitive information are more explicitly defined.
