### Global Distribution and Network Configuration

**Network Structure:**
- **Worldwide Distribution:** The distribution of nodes is based on the data from 21.co (refer to Figure 12a). This distribution is used to define the geographical location of the simulated nodes.
- **Bandwidth and Latency:** Bandwidth and network latency are adapted according to the geographical location, using data from Verizon [2, 36] and testmy.net [34].
- **Miner Distribution:** The mining pool distribution is retrieved from blockchain.info, and the public nodes of these mining pools are distributed to their respective regions (refer to Figure 12b).

**Network Protocols:**
- **Default Protocol:** Standard block request management.
- **Miner-Only Block Push:** Miners push blocks without waiting for requests.
- **Relay Network:** Matt Coralloâ€™s relay network [7], which operates independently of the default Bitcoin P2P overlay network. In our simulations, all miners participate in the relay network when this option is enabled.

### Evaluation Results

#### Simulator Validation
To validate our simulation, we compared the performance of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin with their simulated counterparts. The parameters in Table 5 were adjusted to match the current configurations of the real-world blockchains. For example, we measured Bitcoin's block size distribution and other relevant parameters.

**Case Studies:**
- **Case 1:** Standard block request management.
- **Case 2:** Standard mechanism plus unsolicited block push.
- **Case 3:** Case 2 plus the relay network.
- **Case 4:** Send headers mechanism with unsolicited block push and the relay network.

**Observations:**
- For a block interval of 10 minutes and standard request management, the stale block rate is 1.85%, comparable to the 1.69% reported by Wattenhofer et al. [10]. Note that at the time of Wattenhofer's study, unsolicited block push and the relay network were not available.
- The introduction of unsolicited block push significantly reduces the stale block rate. This is because miners are interconnected and benefit most from the unsolicited block push. The first node's propagation method is crucial for rapid network reach.
- The addition of the relay network does not significantly affect the stale block rate under Bitcoin's transaction load but marginally reduces propagation time. For larger block sizes (e.g., > 2MB), the relay network provides an advantage over unsolicited block push (refer to Table 8).
- The send headers mechanism, while having limited impact compared to a fully deployed relay network and unsolicited block push, mitigates partial eclipse attacks [18].

**Security Impact:**
- To assess the impact of the block interval on the security of PoW blockchains, we fed the resulting stale block rates into our MDP models (refer to Table 7).
- For an adversary with 30% of the total mining power, a lower consensus time increases the relative revenue from selfish mining and decreases the double-spending value.
- The block propagation mechanism significantly impacts blockchain security, as it directly affects the stale block rate. The standard block propagation mechanism offers less resilience against double-spending and selfish mining compared to the other evaluated mechanisms.

**Impact of Block Size:**
- We simulated block sizes ranging from 0.1 MB to 8 MB, given a block interval of 10 minutes.
- Our results suggest that block propagation time increases linearly with block size up to 4 MB, after which it increases exponentially.
- A better block propagation mechanism significantly reduces propagation times and the stale block rate. This aligns with our MDP models, indicating that larger block sizes increase the relative revenue from selfish mining and decrease the double-spending value (refer to Table 8).
- An efficient block propagation mechanism allows the network to maintain nearly the same security provisions against selfish mining and double-spending, as seen in Cases 3 and 4.

**Median Block Propagation Time and Stale Block Rate:**
- We measured the median block propagation time (tM BP) and stale block rate (rs) in real networks and simulations (refer to Table 6).
- For Bitcoin, the stale rate falls between the case where all miners use the relay network and unsolicited block push, and the extreme case where these mechanisms are not used. Litecoin and Dogecoin do not have any relay network.

**Impact of Block Interval:**
- We studied the impact of the block interval on the median block propagation time and the stale block rate in PoW-based blockchains.
- Simulations were run for different block intervals ranging from 25 minutes to 0.5 seconds (refer to Table 7).
- Each simulation was run independently for 10,000 consecutive blocks, and for each of the four different block request management system combinations (Cases 1-4).

**Table 7: Impact of the Block Interval on tM BP and rs**
- **Block Interval (minutes):** 25, 10, 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.33, 0.16, 0.083, 0.033, 0.016, 0.0083
- **tM BP (seconds) and rs (%) for each Case:**
  - **Case 1:** Standard block request management.
  - **Case 2:** Standard mechanism plus unsolicited block push.
  - **Case 3:** Case 2 plus the relay network.
  - **Case 4:** Send headers with unsolicited block push and relay network.

**Table 8: Impact of Block Size on tM BP and rs**
- **Block Size (MB):** 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8
- **tM BP (seconds) and rs (%) for Case 1:**
  - **0.1 MB:** 3.18 s, 0.32%
  - **0.25 MB:** 7.03 s, 0.88%
  - **0.5 MB:** 13.62 s, 1.63%
  - **1 MB:** 27.67 s, 3.17%
  - **2 MB:** 57.79 s, 6.24%
  - **4 MB:** 133.30 s, 11.85%
  - **8 MB:** 571.50 s, 23.70%
