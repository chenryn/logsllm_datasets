## Abstract
This presentation introduces TABOR, a graphical model-based approach for anomaly detection in industrial control systems. The method addresses the challenges of interpretability, localization, and feasibility by using a combination of timed automata and Bayesian networks.

## 1. Introduction to SWAT
- **P1**: Raw water supply and storage.
- **P2**: Pretreatment via chemical dosing.
- **P3**: Ultrafiltration (UF) and backwash.
- **P4**: De-Chlorination system.
- **P5**: Reverse osmosis (RO).
- **P6**: RO permeate transfer, UF backwash, and cleaning.

### Example of Sensor Attack
- **Attack Scenario**: An attacker manipulates the flow indicator from 2 m³/h to 0.7 m³/h, then to 0 m³/h.
- **Consequence**: Actuators UV and Pump 501 are turned off because the PLC believes there is no water transmitted from the RO feed tank.

## 2. Related Work
- **Knowledge-Based Methods**:
  - Signature: Uses an up-to-date dictionary of known attacks.
  - Intruder Profiling: Identifies specific patterns of misbehavior.
- **Behavior-Specification-Based Methods**:
  - Rules of legitimate behavior based on design specifications.
  - Physical properties that dictate how the system should behave.
- **Behavior-Based Methods**:
  - Statistical approaches.
  - Non-parametric methods, clustering, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection
- **Challenges**:
  1. **Interpretation**: Can we explain the outcome of attack detection?
  2. **Localization**: Can we localize the anomaly in high-dimensional data?
  3. **Feasibility**: Can we verify the model by human experts?

## 3. Methodology
### Data Description
- **Time Range**: December 22, 2015, 4:00 PM - January 2, 2016, 2:59:59 PM
- **Sampling Time**: 1 second
- **Data Size**: 946,719 rows * 53 columns
- **Features**: 51 sensors & actuators, 1 label ('Normal'/'Attack'), 1 timestamp
- **Training Data**: Normal data from December 22, 2015, 4:00 PM to December 28, 2015, 10:00 AM
- **Testing Data**: From December 28, 2015, 10:00 PM to January 2, 2016, 2:59:59 PM
- **Attacks**: 36 scenarios (duration: 101 seconds to 10 hours)

### Decomposition of High-Dimensional Data
- **Automata Learning**: Regular sensor data, e.g., water levels fluctuation.
- **Dependency Learning**: Sensors and actuators in each stage, e.g., pump open -> water level increase.
- **Statistical Checking**: Large noise and subtle trends, e.g., chemical sensor µ ± c*σ.

### Symbolic and Timed Representation
- **Benefits**:
  - High-level behavior overview.
  - Robust to noise.
  - Understandable natural language.
- **Steps**:
  - Extract mean trend value in each chunk.
  - Cluster the mean values.
  - Interpret in natural language: SLOW UP (SU), QUICK UP (QU), STAY CONSTANT (SC), QUICK DOWN (QD).
  - Timed string representation: (SU, 1900), (QU, 600), (SC, 550), (QD, 700).

### Learning Deterministic Timed Automaton
- **Timed Prefix Tree Construction**:
  - Input: Timed strings.
  - Knowledge recall (rote learning).
  - Refinement: Getting distinct timed behavior.
  - Abstraction: Generalization of similar behavior.

### Time Bound
- **Example**: Symbolic representation of LIT sensor is SU, QU, SC, QU, SU. The third letter (SC) is not accepted by the learned state machine, as QD is expected after SC.

### Sensor & Actuator Dependency Learning
- **Concurrent Event Alignment**:
  - Symbolic events in actuator: OPEN or OFF.

### Learning Bayesian Network
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**:
  - Nodes: Random variables.
  - Arcs: Probabilistic dependencies between nodes (lack of link signifies conditional independence).
- **Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD)**:
  - Conditional probabilities at each node, stored as a table (CPT).

### Finding the BN Structure
- **NP-Hard Problem**: Finding the BN structure with the highest score among those with at most k parents for k > 1.
- **Heuristic Methods**:
  - Greedy algorithms, e.g., K2.
  - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

### BN Detection Example
- **Scenario**: Attacker opens MV101 (water pump in), breaking the dependence between sensor and actuator (MV101 should be closed), leading to overflow in the tank.

### Types of Anomalies
- **Timed Automaton**:
  - Event error: Invalid event at a given state.
  - Timing error: Event duration outside valid timing guard.
- **Bayesian Network**:
  - Zero probability entry in the CPD.
- **Out of Alphabet (OOA)**:
  - Sensor value exceeds the threshold.
  - Actuator value did not occur in the training data.
- **Conservative Fusion Strategies**:
  - OOA or (TA and BN).
  - High cost of false positives (FP).
  - TA is sensitive.
  - OOA has the highest priority.

## 4. Results
### Evaluation: Window-Based
- **Time Series Discord**:
  - More meaningful than isolated points.
  - Interval-based evaluation.

### TABOR Detection Results
- **Model Comparison**:
  - **DNN**: 13 scenarios detected.
  - **SVM**: 20 scenarios detected.
  - **TABOR**: 24 scenarios detected.

### Statistical Checking Example
- **Chemical Sensor** and **Pressure Sensor**.

### Point-Based Evaluation
- **Total Size**: 450,000 (125h)
- **True Positives (TP)**: 42,448 (11.79h)
- **False Positives (FP)**: 6,812 (1.89h)
- **True Negatives (TN)**: 389,322 (108.15h)
- **False Negatives (FN)**: 11,418 (3.17h)

### Example of Detection Results
- **PIT501**: False alarm caused by stabilization procedure after an attack.

## 5. Conclusion
- **Interpretation and Localization**: Solution for interpreting and localizing anomalies.
- **Accuracy**: More attack scenarios detected compared to DNN and SVM with low false positives.
- **Efficiency**: Learning in polynomial time and testing in O(1).
