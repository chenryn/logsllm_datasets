I am using the Drawer component in the nav bar with the MenuIcon. In earlier
releases, this worked as expected. When the MenuIcon was clicked, the Drawer
would open, and clicking on any of the Drawer items, or outside the Drawer
would close the Drawer. However, with the latest release, I notice that once
the Drawer opens, if I click anywhere to close the drawer, the MenuIcon
component gets highlighted. I have to click once again on the page to get it
back to normal.
