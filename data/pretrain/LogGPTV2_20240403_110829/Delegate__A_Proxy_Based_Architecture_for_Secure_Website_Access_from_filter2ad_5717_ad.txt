### 5. Security Analysis

Using a completely untrusted machine presents numerous attack vectors. Browsing and accessing web services from such a device will never be as secure as using a trusted one. Delegate significantly reduces the attack surface to achieve an acceptable level of risk.

- **Keystroke Logging and Shoulder Surfing:** An attacker cannot acquire user secrets via keystroke logging or shoulder surfing because these secrets are never entered into the untrusted machine. Additionally, an attacker cannot intercept passwords or other secrets on the local network since they do not traverse the network used by the untrusted machine. However, any information entered directly into the untrusted machine can be compromised.
  
- **Cell Phone as an Attack Target:** The cell phone is a critical target for attackers because it receives one-time PINs from the proxy. If the cell phone is lost or stolen, previously received PINs are worthless. However, until the proxy is informed of the compromise, an attacker could successfully receive new one-time PINs.

- **Proxy Security:** The proxy stores user secrets and must be secured to mitigate potential compromises. It should:
  1. Run in its own user space.
  2. Maintain an audit log.
  3. Refuse connections/requests from any machine that has not supplied a valid one-time PIN.
  4. Allow only one active connection at a time.

- **Web Server Security:** Web servers also store user secrets, which may be accessible to the untrusted machine through two methods:
  1. The web server may disclose this information on a web page, either visibly or hidden (e.g., in a form value).
  2. If an attacker requests a password reminder, the password or a link to change it will be exposed when the user accesses their email account. Filtering at the proxy can counter both these attacks, provided the attack relies entirely on the proxy for information.

- **Communication Links:**
  - **Untrusted Machine to Proxy:** No security guarantees are made for communication between the untrusted machine and the proxy, as the untrusted device controls this link. A TLS connection should be used to avoid passive eavesdropping, but no assumptions about message integrity or confidentiality should be made.
  - **Proxy to Cell Phone:** This link should provide integrity, confidentiality, and authentication. However, this is not always feasible, especially for low-end cell phones. The short-lived nature of one-time PINs mitigates some risks.
  - **Web Server to Proxy:** This link is controlled by the proxy and has the same assurances as any link between a trusted machine and a known web server.

- **Direct Communication:**
  - The untrusted machine can communicate directly with the web server, but withholding necessary authentication credentials prevents it from impersonating the user.
  - Direct communication attempts between the untrusted device and the cell phone cannot be prevented, but the user should be alerted if they occur.

- **User Experience and Security Trade-offs:**
  - Accessing websites directly through the cell phone offers better protection for personal data but sacrifices the benefits of a large screen, full-sized keyboard, bandwidth, and processing power of the untrusted device.

### 6. Experimental Results

This section describes experiments conducted with the Delegate prototype to measure the overhead introduced by the system and the benefits of using a policy-based approach to control session hijacking. The Java-based proxy was run on a Pentium 4 machine with 512 MB RAM and Windows XP. The cell phone used was a Sony Ericsson w800i capable of running J2ME applications.

- **Experiment 1: Response Time Delay**
  - **HTTP Request Interception:** The proxy intercepted HTTP requests and filled in the relevant secrets in less than 1 ms. This includes parsing the HTTP request, retrieving secrets, and reconstructing the request.
  - **Message Transfer:** Transferring a 200-byte message to the cell phone took an average of 420 ms using specialized software. SMS text messaging took an average of 4 seconds.
  - **User Validation:** The largest delay occurs when the user validates messages. The user must carefully read and understand the messages before validating them.

- **Experiment 2: Policy-Based Approach Benefits**
  - **Policy Identification:** Requests known to be dangerous are identified in a policy. Without a policy, the proxy considers all SCR and PIR requests as dangerous.
  - **Key Findings:**
    1. A policy-based approach significantly reduces validation requirements compared to automatic approaches.
    2. The average number of validation messages per session for a typical user is 3.7, compared to 23.1 without a policy.
    3. A trained proxy with site-specific policies can significantly reduce the validation burden on the user, making the system more user-friendly.

### 7. Related Work

- **Ross et al. [8]:** Created a composable framework for multi-modal access to content using both trusted and untrusted devices. Their system uses a proxy-based approach for inserting secrets, scrubbing sensitive data, and validating dangerous requests through a trusted device. The framework is broad, general-purpose, and extensible, but lacks detailed rule language and implementation.
  
- **Wu et al. [9, 10]:** Presented a high-level overview of a proxy-based architecture similar to Delegate. They provided insights into user interactions with such systems but did not address session hijacking.

- **Oprea et al. [5]:** Created a system using VNC to connect an untrusted machine to a trusted one. The untrusted machine receives short-lived, read-only access to the trusted machine, making it immune to session hijacking. However, the constraints of the mobile device may make it difficult to use as the sole input method.

- **SpyBlock [3] and Vault [4]:** Use virtual machines to provide a sandbox for untrustworthy software. These projects cover many of the same topics as Delegate, including prompting users to validate potentially harmful requests and providing APIs for servers to identify dangerous actions.

### 8. Conclusions

This paper introduces Delegate, a proxy-based architecture that allows users to access web services from an untrusted machine without revealing sensitive information. The proxy acts as a middleman, filtering traffic between the untrusted machine and the web service provider to insert secrets on the user's behalf. Delegate does not require changes to the web serverâ€™s authentication protocol and allows users to define rules for classifying dangerous requests. The proxy can contact the user via a cell phone to gain approval for risky requests.

The ideas in Delegate can be incorporated into websites directly, making them suitable for users on both trusted and untrusted machines. Our design targets cell phone users with text messaging capabilities, ensuring a wide user base.

The primary contribution of the paper is the specification of a policy language for establishing rules to classify dangerous web requests and the appropriate action. This methodology is similar to firewall rules that dictate internet traffic. The Delegate proxy acts as a remote personal firewall, inspecting traffic and determining whether it is permitted to flow to or from a website, providing a layer of defense between the untrusted machine and the website.
