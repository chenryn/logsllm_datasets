User: I'm a .NET developer who knows very little about Python, but want to give it a test drive for a small project I'm working on.
What tools and packages should I install on my machine? I'm looking for a common, somewhat comprehensive, development environment.
I'll likely run Ubuntu 9.10, but I'm flexible.  If Windows is a better option, that's fine too.
Edit: To clarify, I'm not looking for the bare minimum to get a Python program to run.  I wouldn't expect a newbie .NET dev to use notepad and a compiler. I'd recommend Visual Studio, NUnit, SQL Server, etc.
Assistant: Python (duh), setuptools or pip, virtualenv, and an editor. I suggest geany, but that's just me. And of course, any other Python modules you'll need.
