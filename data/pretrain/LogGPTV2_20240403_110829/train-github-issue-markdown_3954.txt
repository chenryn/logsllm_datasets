At some situations, plain object isn't the best choise. I tried to render a
`Map` object by `v-for`, but seems `Vue` does not support it currently.
(Here's a post I created in the Help thread on the forum.)
Hope `Vue` can provide the `for ... of` syntax in `v-for` to iterate over data
types like `Map` and `Set`.
For example:
    const map = new Map();
    map.set('key1', 'val1');
    map.set('key2', 'val2');
and we can render `map` in this way:
        {{key}} - {{val}}
