There are a few other related issues regarding to this problem. But I think
none of them explained why this is really needed.
asset() by default, will only output a path that is absolute under the current
domain. If assets_base_urls is set then it will output an absolute url with
domain. This is generally fine in most cases. However if twig is used to
generate an email template, we will always want an absolute url with domain
name regardless of the assets_base_urls setting.
Given that it is not easily possible to detect whether assets_base_urls is
set, a better alternative is to accept a second parameter for asset(). If
assets_base_urls is not set, then it will use the current domain and scheme.
If otherwise then it will simply follow the original behaviour.
