compared with the power behavior of the original workloads,
the power consumption of the PDU drops immediately after
the success of the power attack. In our simulation, we have
performed four similar power attack attempts to four different
PDUs sequentially at the scale of a data center. The results are
shown in Figure 16, in which each attack is represented as an
arrow and the ﬁrst arrow is the attack shown in Figure 15.
All attacks successfully trip the targeted PDU-level CBs.
However, the power curve of the entire data center recovers
shortly after the ﬁrst three attacks. This is because when one
PDU fails, the workload manager in DC restarts and evenly
redistributes those workloads from the servers lost power to
other servers with stable power supply. Thus, the impact of
PDU-level power attacks is reduced at a certain degree at the
cost of power load increase in other PDUs. However, after
the fourth attack in 49-50 hour, the computing capacity of
whole data center (i.e., the number of available servers) is
greatly diminished due to the power outages. The remainder
of available servers cannot support the signiﬁcant increase of
original workload density starting at 58th hour, regardless of
the workload management. Thus, the load balancer of the data
center starts to reject service requests and the rejection ends
till 69th hour. During this period of time (i.e., from 58th to
69th hours), only about 53% of service requests are processed
and the rest are rejected. As a result, the DC-level power
consumption is just half of the original amount, which is
clearly shown in the area of the oscillating power curve in
Figure 16. The entire data center ﬁnally resumes to normal
between 69th and 70th hours with the signiﬁcant decrease of
workload supply.
it
is possible that
Next, we target at tripping the DC-level CB. As afore-
mentioned,
the DC-level CB is tripped
without the trip of any PDU-level CBs. Here we illustrate
three power attacks that target at the DC-level CB in three
workload regions, respectively, in Figure 17. When DC is
processing workloads in the peak region, it is defenseless to
the 30% power increase, as shown in Figure 17(a). Although
the impact of the power attack is mitigated by the load balancer
at some degree, the margin to the power threshold of the DC-
level CB is very small. As a result, the whole data center
quickly fails under the power attack. For the power attack in
the medium region, in Figure 17(b), we observe the similar
results. Especially, when the original workload increases uphill
and still in the medium region, the power attack successfully
shuts down the entire data center. However, unlike the power
attack in the peak region, there exist possibilities that power
attacks could fail in this region as the total power consumption
(i.e., Original+Attack) is smaller than the capacity of the DC-
level CB. Attackers could either increase the size of attack
workloads (at a risk of being discovered by the data center
administrators) or ﬁnd the right time to launch such an attack
again. For the power attack in the valley region, due to the
same reason as the failed attack attempts in the medium region,
we have not succeeded in triggering a power outage in the DC
with the same malicious workloads. Although not all power
attempts lead to power outages of the target, our simulation
shows two observations: (1) there is a noticeable possibility of
a power attack success at the data center level, especially at
peak times, which leads to disastrous consequences. (2) The
damage of power attacks could be weakened by pre-deﬁned
DC management policies to some extent. Next, we discuss
those results in details.
C. Damage assessment and discussion
Our simulation results further demonstrate the potential
threat of power attacks. For example, the PDU-level simulation
shows that a power attack can trip the CB at the PDU level. The
data center-level simulation demonstrates that a power attack
could potentially shut down the entire data center. Table III lists
some statistics of all the simulated power attacks. The attack
against the entire data center succeeds when the workload is
in the peak and medium regions, but fails in the valley region.
Moreover, the power attack in the medium region takes several
attempts and lasts longer than that in the peak region, due to the
workload management policies commonly employed in a data
center, such as load balancing. It is important to note that such
management policies are not originally designed to defend
against power attacks, though they could slightly weaken the
impacts of a power attack only to a limited degree. On the
other hand, from an attacker’s perspective, our results suggest
that a power attack is more effective when the data center
workload is in the peak region. Since the workload traces of
many data centers are accessible to the public and usually
follow a well-known diurnal pattern, it is not difﬁcult for the
attacker to ﬁgure out when it is the best time to launch an
effective power attack.
Comparing the number of accessible servers and the attack
duration (Table III) at both the DC and PDU levels, it is
obvious that a power attack requires less resources at a lower
(i.e., the PDU) level. To attack a rack or all racks in a PDU, the
attacker only needs to access a moderate number of servers.
However, the attacker would need to have the knowledge that

those servers are located within the target rack/PDU. On the
contrary, to launch a power attack against the entire data center,
the attacker does not need to know such location information.
In our simulation at the DC level, we assume that all the servers
are accessible to the attacker. However, in the real world, such
an assumption may not be true. For example, some servers in
a data center may be disconnected from the Internet or have
some strong security protection, so the attacker cannot gain the
access to them. However, as discussed in previous sections, a
30% power increase is not the greatest amount of increase a
power attack can generate. Therefore, even if a power attacker
can only access just a portion of servers within a PDU or a data
center, it is still possible that the overall power consumption
would be increased by about 30%, leading to the disastrous
server shutdowns.
VIII.
IMPACT OF NEW POWER MANAGEMENT
SOLUTIONS
In this section, we discuss the impacts of some new
power management strategies on power attack. Although these
strategies have not yet been widely deployed, it is highly likely
that they could be employed in future data centers. Some of
the strategies may mitigate the threat of power attack while
the others may increase the risk.
A. Power capping
Power capping is a solution that can limit the maximum
power consumption of a target unit within a user-speciﬁed
power cap in a data center. For example, server-level power
capping [18] leverages feedback control theory to limit the
power consumption of a server. Similarly, the power con-
sumption of multiple servers in a rack or PDU can also be
capped [27], [28], [35]. For an entire data center, a hierarchical
power control solution called SHIP [36] has been proposed to
provide power capping hierarchically at three different levels:
rack, PDU, and the whole data center. For all those power
capping strategies, the power consumption of the target is
monitored periodically in real time and dynamically controlled

to ensure that it stays below the speciﬁed power cap. For
instance, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is
commonly used to lower the CPU frequencies (and voltage) of
selected servers when the current power consumption is higher
than the cap. In the meantime, within the cap, power capping
tries to run the servers at their highest possible frequencies
for optimizing system performance. Power capping can also
allow a data center operator to host more servers (i.e., power
oversubscription), without upgrading the power infrastructure,
by having a power cap that is just slightly lower than the rated
capacity of the corresponding CB.
Power capping can deﬁnitely help to defend against power
attack, because power attack is to generate power spikes while
power capping is to shave power spikes. However, in practice,
there are three major challenges that prevent power capping
from becoming an effective defense solution: reactive manner,
the selection of control period, and long settling time. First,
power capping works in a reactive manner because its periodic
power sampling determines that it can only respond to any
power budget violation. Any power spikes occur between
two consecutive power sampling points (i.e., within a control
period) cannot be detected by power capping. Since the control
period can be as long as several minutes at the data center
level [36], a power attacker can easily launch an attack success-
fully before power capping can even detect it. Second, in power
capping, the selection of control period is a trade-off between
system responsiveness and computation/communication over-
heads. A power capping controller needs to periodically collect
the power and performance information from all the controlled
servers through the data center network, make centralized
and computational-intensive capping decisions, and then send
the decisions back to the servers to change their hardware
DVFS levels for power capping. A control period has to
be long enough for all those steps to ﬁnish. Therefore, the
control period can be longer than 2 minutes for the SHIP
hierarchical controller [36]. However, 2 minutes is already
long enough for a CB to trip even when it has only a 25%
power overload [13]. As shown in our hardware experiments,
a 30% or higher power rise can be easily generated by an
attacker through various ways such as parasite attack. Finally,
a power capping controller normally cannot immediately drag
the power consumption lower than the CB capacity within
one control period, even if it detects a power attack. Most
controllers need a settling time of at least six or more control
periods [36], which means a total time interval of 12 minutes
