# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

1. **Automatic and Proper Tiling of Windows**: The new feature will enable automatic and proper tiling of windows in the window manager (WM).
2. **Key Binding for Mode Selection**: Users will be able to bind keys to select different tiling modes, such as priority, other, or grid.
3. **Custom Template Management**: Users can create and group custom presets into a custom template. These templates can be switched using the key bindings described above. Additionally, when opening a custom template, users will have the option to specify which template to use for any missing descriptors.

**Note**: I was unsure whether to create three separate feature requests or combine them into one.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

1. **Automatic Tiling**:
   - The system will automatically read the number of applications running on the desktop, excluding floating windows.
   - Users will be able to set windows as floating with a keyboard shortcut.

2. **Sorting and Arrangement**:
   - Implement a list of sorting methods for the tiling process. Examples include:
     - Priority-based tiling
     - Grid-based tiling
     - Other user-defined tiling patterns

   - A visual representation of the proposed sorting methods is provided below:

By implementing these features, the window manager will provide a more flexible and efficient tiling experience for users.
