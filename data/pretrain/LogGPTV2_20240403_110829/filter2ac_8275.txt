**Description:**
Adversaries may exploit AppleScript for execution. AppleScript is a scripting language native to macOS, designed to automate and control applications and various components of the operating system through inter-application messages known as AppleEvents. These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted using AppleScript. 

AppleScript's capabilities include locating open windows, sending keystrokes, and interacting with almost any locally or remotely running application. This versatility makes it a potential vector for malicious actors to execute commands, manipulate system processes, and perform other unauthorized actions.
