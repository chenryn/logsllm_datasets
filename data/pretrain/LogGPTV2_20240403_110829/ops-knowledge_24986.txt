User: I'm trying to use Z3 from its python interface, but I would prefer not to do a system-wide install (i.e. sudo make install). I tried doing a local install with a --prefix, but the Makefile is hard-coded to install into the system's python directory. 
Best case, I would like run z3 directly from the build directly, in the same way I use the z3 binary (build/z3). Does anyone know how to, or have script, to run the z3py directly from the build directory, without doing an install?
Assistant: Yes, you can do it by including the build directory in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables.
