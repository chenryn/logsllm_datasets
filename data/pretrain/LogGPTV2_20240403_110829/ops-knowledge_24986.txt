I am trying to use Z3 through its Python interface, but I prefer not to perform a system-wide installation (i.e., using `sudo make install`). I attempted a local installation by specifying a `--prefix`, but the Makefile is hardcoded to install into the system's Python directory.

Ideally, I would like to run Z3 directly from the build directory, similar to how I use the Z3 binary (located at `build/z3`). Does anyone know how to run `z3py` directly from the build directory without performing an installation?

**Solution:**
You can achieve this by including the build directory in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables. This will allow you to run `z3py` directly from the build directory without needing to install it system-wide.
