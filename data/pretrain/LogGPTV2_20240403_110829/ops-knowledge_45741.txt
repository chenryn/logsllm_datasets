User: Task is:
I have task queue stored in db. It grows. I need to solve tasks by python script when I have resources for it. I see two ways:

python script working all the time. But i don't like it (reason posible memory leak).
python script called by cron and do a little part of task. But i need to solve the problem of one working active script in memory (To prevent active scripts count grow). What is the best solution to implement it in python?

Any ideas to solve this problem at all?
Assistant: This is a bit of a vague question. One thing you should remember is that it is very difficult to leak memory in Python, because of the automatic garbage collection. croning a Python script to handle the queue isn't very nice, although it would work fine.
I would use method 1; if you need more power you could make a small Python process that monitors the DB queue and starts new processes to handle the tasks.
