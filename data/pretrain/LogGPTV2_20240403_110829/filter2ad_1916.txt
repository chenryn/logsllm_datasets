ABSTRACT 
In  this  paper,  a  new  digital  watermarking  scheme  that  uses 
human visual system and the quadtree decomposition technique is 
proposed.    The watermark image is split into the insignificant and 
significant  parts  respectively  according  to  their  importance  in  the 
image, then the split watermarks are embedded perceptually into the 
spatial and frequency domains. The embedding energy relies on the 
minimally-noticeable-distortion  (MND)  energy  of  the  embedded 
position  either  in  the  spatial  or  frequency  domain.    Experimental 
results show that the proposed scheme can resist the attacks such as 
image cropping , etc. 
Keywords:  human  visual  system,  combinational  watermarking, 
quadtree decomposition, MND. 
1. Introduction 
In  recent  years,  an  overwhelmingly  large  amount  of  research 
work has been done in watermarking digital  images  for copyright 
protection.    Therefore,  there  are  many  aspects  to  be  noticed  in 
watermarking  design,  for  example,  transparency,  capacity  and 
robustness.  Shih  and  Wu 
[2]  proposed  a  combinational 
watermarking  scheme,  two  split  watermarks  were  embedded  into 
the  host  image  in  their  scheme.  Nevertheless  the  insertion  of   
embedded positions of two split watermarks are overlaid.    A new 
technique  based  on  the  human  visual  system  and  the  quadtree 
decomposition technique was proposed and the watermarks conflict 
problem  can  be  avoided  by  using  the  quadtree  decomposition 
structure of the host image.     
2. Proposed scheme 
First,  the  watermark  image  is  split  into  two  parts,  one  is  the 
spatial watermark Ws with insignificant part and the other one is the 
frequency watermark Wf with significant part, then the embedding 
operation is processed in the spatial domain and frequency domain 
respectively.   
Let  Qn  be  the  set  of  quadregions  with  size  n  x  n,  Qs  is  the 
quadregions  with  smaller  block  size,  and  Qf   is  the  quadregions 
with  larger  block  size.    Fig.1  shows  the  quadtree  decomposition 
for  the  host  image  ‘Lena’  while  a  threshold  Ts  is  given  for  the 
criterion  (cid:305) (cid:148)  Ts,  where  (cid:305)  is  the  standard  deviations  for  the

quadregion block.     
The MND(x,y) energy [1] could be adopted as the strength factor 
for the watermark embedding in each detail pixel(x,y).    The spatial 
watermark Ws is adequate to be embedded in the quadregions Qs for 
the  following  reasons:  (1)  the  size  of  the  spatial  watermark  is 
usually larger than the frequency watermark Wf. (2) the content of 
the watermark Ws  is less important then the  frequency  watermark 
Wf.  (3)  the  necessity  of  capacity  for  the  spatial  watermark  Ws  is 
more necessary than the frequency watermark Wf.    On the contrary, 
the frequency watermark Wf  is suitable to be embedded in  the Qf
with larger size.

3. Conclusions 
The  proposed  perceptual  scheme  possesses 
the  following 
advantages: (1) The capacity of embedded information is increased 
for  more  watermarks  embedding.    (2)  The  splitting  of  the 
watermark  makes  the  degree  of  security  more  robust.  (3)  The 
watermarks conflict problem can be avoided. (4) It is not necessary 
to  share  the  same  global  security  parameter  for  watermarking 
embedding.    It is believed to have both advantages of spatial and 
frequency domains.
