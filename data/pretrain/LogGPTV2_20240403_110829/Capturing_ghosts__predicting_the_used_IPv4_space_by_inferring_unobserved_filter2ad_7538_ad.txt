To perform cross-validation with our k = 9 data sources we con-
sider a particular source i as the “universe” of possible IPv4 ad-
dresses. We apply CR to the addresses/subnets in i that are also in
the other k−1 sources, to estimate the number of individuals unique
to source i. Since we know the true number of individuals unique
to i, we can evaluate the eﬀectiveness of CR. We do this for each
source, to obtain the mean error and mean-square error. We then
assume that the CR estimator based on the full k sets is equally ac-
curate at estimating the true number of ghosts, although we do not
have conﬁdence intervals for this.
5.1 Model selection
We ﬁrst investigated how to best select models, as our model se-
lection approach in Section 3.3.2 leaves us with the choice of two
ICs and the choice of how to dimension the count pre-processing
heuristic. In initial experiments we varied the IC used (AIC, BIC)
and we varied d for the count pre-processing heuristic. The vari-
able d was either adaptive (starting with d = 1000 in each step we
halved d, selecting the ﬁrst d smaller than mins zs) or ﬁxed to values
of 1, 10, 100, or 1000.
For each parameter setting we performed cross-validation for
each time window, except the ﬁrst window for which we have the
least data, for both used IPv4 addresses and used /24 subnets. Ta-
ble 3 shows the diﬀerent parameter settings we investigated and the
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
averaged over all sources and time windows.
With a ﬁxed divisor using the actual counters (ﬁxed1) results in
the highest errors for IPs but provides low errors for /24 subnets.
We think this is because (1) there is much more noise in the ob-
served IPs than in the observed /24 subnets and (2) the number of
observed /24 subnets is much lower than the number of IPs, and
hence even for a small divisor of 10 we already start losing in-
formation for /24 subnets, which leads to much reduced accuracy.
Choosing a divisor around 100 results in the smallest error for IPs
but the largest error for /24 subnets. Eﬀectively, the choice depends
on the type of data and it is unclear what choice would be the best
for estimating the IP addresses and /24 subnets unseen overall.
In contrast, our adaptive approach (with a maximum divisor of
1000) works quite well for both IPs and /24 subnets, with errors not
much larger than the minimum errors. With the adaptive approach,
using the BIC instead of the AIC lowers the error for IPs and in-
creases the error for /24 subnets, but the increase for /24 subnets is
small and even for /24 subnets the estimates obtained with the BIC
are smoother.7 Hence, in the rest of the paper the estimates pre-

many sources, which have a much lower number of samples than
interactions between fewer sources and hence are noisier.

of 1000 and we use the BIC.
5.2 Comparison with ground truth
We compared our observed and estimated IP addresses with the
ground truth for several networks. Our ground truth is estimates
of the number of actively used IPv4 addresses at peak times (eﬀec-
tively high watermarks). Since our time windows are very long (12
months), it is appropriate to compare our estimates with high wa-
termarks. We compare the ground truth with the observed and es-
timated numbers for the time windows where the high watermarks
occurred roughly in the middle of the windows.
For privacy reasons we cannot reveal the identity of the net-
works. We also cannot reveal their sizes, as this would leak in-
formation, which allows narrowing down the possible identities (to
a very small set in the case of one particular network). The largest
network covered is two /16 subnets and the smallest network is
roughly one /20 combined from multiple allocations.
For each network Table 4 shows the number of addresses that re-
sponded to ping, the number of addresses observed, the number of
addresses estimated (for both Poisson and right-truncated Poisson),
and the actual number of used addresses as percentages of the sizes
of the routed networks. Note that network F blocked our pinger, so
we do not have IPING or TPING data for this network.
The results show that the percentage of pingable and observed
addresses is much smaller than the ground truth for networks A, C,
D, E and F, whereas for the more “open” network B the percentage
of observed addresses is relatively close to the truth. However, the
CR estimates are always much closer to the truth. Using right-
truncated Poisson distributions gives better estimates than using
Poisson distributions. The right-truncated Poisson estimates tend
to be higher than the truth (except for network F where we do not
have IPING and TPING), but the cause may be dynamic addresses
(e.g. DHCP) leading to higher estimates due to our long 12-month
observation windows in contrast to the short-term peak numbers we
use as truth.
5.3 Cross-validation results illustrated
Figure 3 illustrates the results of the cross-validation for ad-
dresses and subnets for time window 9 (results for other time win-
dows are largely consistent). The ﬁgure shows the number of IPs in
each source also observed by IPING (Obs ping), the total number
of addresses of a source also observed by any other sources (Obs.
all), and the ranges of the CR estimates (conﬁdence interval based
on proﬁle likelihood with α = 10−7 to get wide intervals). Since
the sources are of diﬀerent sizes we normalised the number of ad-
dresses on the total number of addresses observed by each source

RV [14]. For each time window we downloaded and ag-
gregated weekly snapshots (excluding unallocated but adver-
tised preﬁxes). Gregori et al. [26] suggests that while RV
data is incomplete for AS-level graph analysis, it does cap-
ture the whole routed space.
• Observed IPv4 addresses and /24 subnets:
the ad-
dresses/networks present in one or several of the data sources
described in Section 4.1.
• Estimated IPv4 addresses and /24 subnets: the total number
of addresses/networks estimated with CR, which means the
observed addresses/networks plus the unseen estimated ad-
dresses/networks. For clarity in the ﬁgures we plot the point
estimates instead of the estimated ranges.
Figure 3: IP addresses observed with ping, observed by any source,
and estimated ranges for LLM normalised on the true number of
unseen IPs for each data source
In the ﬁgures with normalised data, we always normalise each se-
ries on the ﬁrst value – the ﬁrst time window (31 December 2011).
6.2 Used IPv4 space totals
(the ground truth). A CR estimate is good, if the normalised range
includes 1 and the range is not too large.
Figure 3 shows that for IPv4 addresses all sources other than
IPING and GAME have relatively high overlap, but between 10%
and 15% of addresses appear only in one source. Only 50–60%
of addresses of each source (except TPING) is in IPING, showing
that ICMP pinging undercounts signiﬁcantly. The CR estimates for
WIKI, WEB, IPING, MLAB, SPAM, and SWIN are quite good.
The estimated ranges for TPING and CALT are slightly too low,
and the estimated range for GAME is slightly too high. Neverthe-
less, the LLM CR estimates are a substantial improvement over just
using the number of observed IPs.
For brevity we do not show the ﬁgure for /24 subnets. For /24
subnets there is a very high overlap between all data sources. How-
ever, for most sources only 90% or less of the /24 subnets appear in
IPING, so just using ICMP pinging signiﬁcantly undercounts even
the used /24 subnets. While the diﬀerence between CR estimates
and observed addresses is much smaller for /24 subnets (in most
cases the diﬀerence is only 1–2%, except for IPING), our CR esti-
mates are still an improvement.
Table 5 shows the estimated used IPv4 addresses and /24 subnets
depending on diﬀerent stratiﬁcations (RIR, country, preﬁx size, in-
dustry, allocation age) as introduced in Section 3.4, as well as the
pingable, observed and estimated unseen addresses and /24 subnets
at the end of June 2014. For each type of stratiﬁcation we separated
each source into the diﬀerent strata, then used CR to estimate the
size of each strata, and ﬁnally we summed up the estimates over all
strata to get the total estimate.
Only 430 million IPs and 4.9 million /24s responded to ICMP
ping, but we observed 740 million IPs and 5.9 million /24s from
all sources combined. The estimated used IPs are fairly consistent
across stratiﬁcations: roughly 1.1–1.2 billion used IPv4 addresses
and 6.2–6.3 million used /24 subnets. Based on RV this means we
observed only 27% of the routed IPv4 addresses and 55% of the
routed /24 subnets, but we estimate that roughly 45% of the routed
IPv4 addresses and 60% of the routed /24 subnets were used.
For all stratiﬁcations our estimates are always plausible (below
the number of routed addresses). The quotient of estimated used
addresses divided by the addresses detected only with ICMP echo
pinging is 2.6–2.7, larger than the correction factor of 1.86 in [3].
