### Ensuring Attractiveness of Blocker Tags for Consumer Privacy

To ensure the attractiveness of blocker tags as a widespread tool for protecting consumer privacy, they must cause minimal or no disruption to normal RFID-based commercial processes such as inventory control. A universal blocker tag, which indiscriminately disrupts all RFID tag readings in its vicinity, would be counterproductive. It would provide privacy protection but at the cost of significant operational disruptions.

### Selective Blocker Tags and Privacy Zones

For practical privacy enhancement, selective blocker tags are required. These tags operate by designating specific zones for privacy protection. A "privacy zone" is a restricted range of tag serial numbers targeted for protection (i.e., simulation) by a selective blocker tag. When a reader enters a region identified by the blocker tag as a privacy zone, the blocker tag disrupts the execution of the tree-walking algorithm. Outside this zone, the blocker tag remains inactive.

By using privacy zones and dynamically altering tag serial numbers, it is possible to implement a range of privacy policies that can simultaneously satisfy the needs of both consumers and businesses. For example, serial numbers can be transferred inside or outside privacy zones based on the context in which they are used.

### Engineering Selective Blocker Tags

The simplest way to engineer a selective blocker tag is to define the corresponding privacy zone as a subtree of a single node. This corresponds to a set of serial numbers with a common binary prefix. For instance, a privacy zone might consist of the right half of the serial number tree, including all serial numbers with a leading '1' bit.

### Example: Retail Setting

**Example 1: Privateway Supermarkets**

Privateway Supermarkets use blocker tags whose privacy zone consists of all serial numbers with a leading '1' bit. Each package in the supermarket bears an RFID tag with a unique serial number for inventory control. Initially, and while an item is inside the supermarket or its warehouses, the serial number in its RFID tag carries a leading '0' bit, ensuring that blocker tags do not disrupt tag reading.

When an RFID-tag reader at a cash register scans an item for purchase, it transmits a tag-specific key to the RFID tag, causing the leading bit in the serial number to flip to a '1'. Privateway Supermarkets provide free blocker tags, available embedded in shopping bags or as stickers to be placed on items.

When Alice returns home from her shopping trip, she unmasks items in the privacy zone by detaching them from shopping bags or removing their privacy-enhancing stickers. When she places items in her "smart" refrigerator, an attached RFID reader tallies the contents, allowing her home computer to print a list of items for her next shopping trip.

### Incorporation into EPC-Code System

A simple scheme like this could be naturally incorporated into the EPC-code system of the AutoID center. An EPC code comprises 96 bits, partitioned as follows:
1. An 8-bit header.
2. A 28-bit "EPC-manager" code, designating the organization that owns the tag.
3. A 24-bit "object-manager" code, designating the class of object.
4. A 36-bit serial number that uniquely identifies the object.

We could implement our privacy scheme by designating one of the bits in the object manager code as a standard "privacy bit." All blocker tags could then be assigned a unique collective EPC-manager code. This scheme would be reader-friendly, as readers could check for the presence of the EPC-manager code for blocker tags by following the corresponding path down the identifier tree.

### Multiple Privacy Zones

In many cases, having multiple, independent privacy zones would be useful. Different types of blocker tags or devices could be used to implement a variety of privacy policies. Here are some examples:

**Example 2: Multiple Privacy Zones**

Suppose the first two bits of tag serial numbers specify a desired privacy zone ranging from zero to three. Alice might carry a "zone-one" blocker tag in her wristwatch to protect her clothing and personal appliances, all marked with the "zone-one" prefix. On the other hand, her grocery items could be marked with the "zone-two" prefix, and privacy stickers for these items carry "zone-two" blocker tags. Thus, when the stickers are removed, Alice can handle them without her wristwatch interfering with the reading process.

**Example 3: Currency Zone**

The European Central Bank has indicated its intention to embed RFID tags in banknotes. Serial numbers for these tags could be relegated to a special privacy zone for currency. Wallets could be equipped with embedded blocker tags or credit-card-like devices bearing blocker tags. In sensitive locations like airports, law-enforcement officials could temporarily sequester wallets in Faraday cages during security checks to detect and remove suspicious "currency-zone" blocker tags.

**Example 4: Recycling and Clustering**

Tags in consumer items might be constructed so that their serial numbers and other highly individual data can be transferred to a privacy zone. To facilitate recycling, tags on plastic items might carry and readily broadcast their polymer-type number. However, a privacy risk is the effect of "clustering," where the polymer numbers for multiple objects together constitute a unique identifier. This risk is mitigated because most common consumer items made of recyclable plastic do not remain with a consumer in large quantities for very long.

### Mitigating Spillover Effects

Another use of multiple zones is to protect against spillover effects from blocker tags. If Alice is carrying a blocker tag and standing near Bob, her blocker tag may extend its disruptive effects to the reading of tags carried by Bob. By using a reasonably large collection of privacy zones, each person could make use of a blocker tag protecting a fixed, random zone, reducing the likelihood of spillover.

### Trade-offs and Considerations

There is a trade-off between individual privacy and the number of possible privacy zones and policies. If each blocker tag were to implement a unique policy, the policy itself would become a unique identifier, undermining privacy. Therefore, the set of possible privacy zones should not be too large in a given RFID-tag system.

One drawback of blocker tags is that they are effectively an "opt-out" mechanism, supporting a system where tags are active by default, and consumers must take steps to acquire blockers to protect their privacy. However, blocker tags could be made widely available from various sources, such as merchants, consumer rights organizations, and checkout counters.

### Malicious Use of Blocker Tags

Blocker tags can be misused to simulate multiple identifiers and circumvent the intended RFID reader protocol. While legitimate privacy applications also simulate multiple identifiers, malicious blocker tags do not respect the boundaries of an allowed privacy zone. RFID readers can be designed to cope with intended blocker behavior within the privacy zone, but their basic functionality requires them to read tags outside this zone. Thus, a malicious blocker tag effectively mounts a denial-of-service attack against the RFID reader protocol.

Detection of such attacks is relatively straightforward. If the number of perceived RFID tags exceeds a reasonable threshold, an attack can be assumed to be in progress. More sophisticated detection mechanisms might rely on prescribed tag ID ranges, connected to a database listing every valid tag in the range of identifiers associated with a particular manufacturer.

### Conclusions

We propose the use of blocker tags as a method for protecting consumer privacy threatened by the pervasive use of RFID tags on consumer products. The use of "selective blocking" by blocker tags enables consumers to "hide" certain RFID tags from scanning when they want to and "reveal" those same tags for scanning when they need to. By allowing ID prefixes to be rewritten, tags can be moved in or out of "privacy zones" protected by various blocker tags.

We believe that blocker tags are a potent and very useful tool for protecting consumer privacy and recommend the standardization of their behavior and utilization along the lines proposed here.
