To ensure its attractiveness as a widespread tool for pro-
tection of consumer privacy, the blocker tag must create
little or no disruption of normal RFID-based commercial
processes like inventory control. In this respect, a universal
blocker tag would be counterproductive:
it would provide
privacy protection, but at the cost of indiscriminately dis-
rupting all RFID-tag reading in its vicinity.
For the purpose of practical privacy enhancement, we
must instead require the use of selective blocker tags. This
involves the special designation of one or more zones for
privacy protection. Thus a “privacy zone” consists of a
restricted range of tag serial numbers targeted for protec-
tion (i.e., simulation) by a selective blocker tag. A selective
blocker tag disrupts reader execution of the tree-walking al-
gorithm whenever it enters a region identiﬁed by the blocker
tag as privacy zone; when reading takes place outside of this
zone, however, the blocker tag remains inactive.
With the use of privacy zones and some dynamic alter-
ation of tag serial numbers, it is possible to implement a
natural range of privacy policies that may simultaneously
satisfy the needs of consumers and businesses. We envis-
age systems in which serial numbers are transferred inside
or outside privacy zones depending upon the situations in
which they are used.
It is simplest to engineer a selective blocker tag in which
the corresponding privacy zone consists of the subtree of a
single node. (Recall that this corresponds to the set of serial
numbers with some common binary preﬁx.) Such a zone, for
instance, might consist simply of the right half of the serial-
number tree, namely all serial numbers whose leading bit
consists of a ‘1’. We provide an example of how a privacy
zone of this kind might be used in a retail setting of the
future.
Example 1. Privateway Supermarkets makes use of
blocker tags whose privacy zone consists of all serial numbers
with a leading ‘1’ bit. Packages in Privateway Supermarkets
each bear an RFID tag with a unique serial number used for
purposes of inventory control. As initially programmed, and
while an item is inside the supermarket or its warehouses,
the serial number in its RFID tag carries a leading ‘0’ bit.
At this point, blocker tags don’t disrupt the reading of tags.
When the RFID-tag reader at a cash register scans an item
for purchase by a customer, it also transmits a tag-speciﬁc
key to the RFID tag on the item.2 This causes the leading
bit in the serial number of the tag to ﬂip to a ‘1’. Privateway
Supermarkets provides its customers with free blocker tags.
These are available embedded in shopping bags at registers
or as stickers to be placed on items.
When Alice returns home from her shopping trip to Pri-
vateway Supermarkets, she unmasks items in the privacy
zone by detaching them from shopping bags or removing their
privacy-enhancing stickers.3 When she places items in her
“smart” refrigerator, an attached RFID reader tallies the
contents. (By keeping track of this inventory, Alice’s home
computer can print out a list of items for purchase on Alice’s
next trip to the supermarket.)
A simple scheme like this could be naturally incorporated
into the EPC-code system of the AutoID center [2]. An
EPC code comprises 96 bits, sequentially partitioned as fol-
lows: (1) An 8-bit header; (2) A 28-bit “EPC-manager”
code, designating the organization that owns the tag; (3) A
24-bit “object-manager” code, designating the class of ob-
ject as determined by the EPC manager; and (4) A 36-bit
serial number that uniquely identiﬁes the object.
Thus we could implement our illustrated privacy scheme
by having one of the bits of the object manager code desig-
nated a standard “privacy bit”. All blocker tags could then
be assigned a unique collective EPC-manager code.
This scheme would be reader-friendly. To determine
whether a blocker tag is present, a reader would initially
check whether the EPC-manager code for blocker tags is
present by following the corresponding path down the iden-
(Note that a blocker tag would simulate all
tiﬁer tree.
EPC-manager codes, but a particular one would serve as
an agreed-upon indicator of blocking.) The privacy bit in
the object-manager code for a tag could be ﬂipped on or oﬀ
according to the policies of the tag EPC manager.
4.1 Multiple privacy zones
In many cases, it would be useful to have multiple, in-
dependent privacy zones. By associating diﬀerent privacy-
enhancing practices with diﬀerent zones, it would be possible
to maintain a collection of overlapping privacy policies. Dif-
ferent types of blocker tags or devices might then be used
to implement a variety of privacy policies. We illustrate the
idea here with several examples.
Example 2. Suppose that the ﬁrst two bits of tag serial
numbers specify a desired privacy zone ranging from zero
2This key should be secret so as to prevent an attacker from
transferring serial numbers arbitrarily into the privacy zone.
3To ensure that stickers no longer perform blocking when re-
moved, they might be constructed to deactivate completely
upon removal by means, e.g., of detachment of their an-
tennae; bags might similarly be equipped with deactivation
mechanisms. Personal blocking devices, of course, may be
equipped with on/oﬀ or policy-setting switches.
to three. Alice might carry a “zone-one” blocker tag in her
wristwatch. So as to protect her clothing and personal appli-
ances from scrutiny, all of these items would then be marked
with the “zone-one” preﬁx.
On the other hand, Alice might like to be able to handle
groceries without blocking their tags. In this case, on check-
out, her grocery items could be marked with the “zone-two”
preﬁx, while privacy stickers for these items carry “zone-
two” blocker tags. Thus, when the stickers are removed, Al-
ice can handle them without her wristwatch interfering with
the reading process. Alice might choose, on the other hand,
for her automobile to implement the strongest level of pro-
tection, blocking RFID-tag reading in all four zones.
Example 3. As explained above, the European Central
Bank has indicated its intention to embed RFID tags in ban-
knotes. Serial numbers for these tags might be relegated to
a special privacy zone for currency.
To protect the privacy of consumers, then, wallets could be
equipped with imbedded blocker tags or with credit-card-like
devices bearing blocker tags.
The presence of a “currency-zone” blocker tag would be
easily detectable, as explained in the next section. Thus,
in sensitive locations like airports, law-enforcement oﬃcials
could take the approach of temporarily sequestering wallets
in Faraday cages during security checks. They could then de-
tect the presence of suspicious “currency-zone” blocker tags.
In the absence of such tags, or following their identiﬁcation
and removal, it would be possible to monitor large and sus-
picious currency ﬂows. (The desirable policies are obviously
a subject for debate; we merely note here that the availabil-
ity of blocker tags allows one to consider a realistic range of
policies that was heretofore unattainable.)
Law-enforcement oﬃcials would also be able to scan ban-
knotes quickly and without impediment when they pass
through ﬁnancial institutions.
Example 4. As illustrated above, tags in consumer items
might be constructed so that their serial numbers and other
highly individual data can be transferred to a privacy zone.
At the same time, to facilitate recycling, tags on plastic items
might carry and readily broadcast their polymer-type number
(a value that ranges between 1 and 7). This could be accom-
plished, for instance, by having a special class of rudimentary
RFID tags used uniquely for recycling.
A privacy risk in this approach is the eﬀect of “cluster-
ing”. In particular, the polymer numbers for a multiplicity
of objects would together constitute a unique identiﬁer. Most
common consumer items made of recyclable plastic, however
– e.g., soda bottles – do not remain with a consumer in large
quantities for very long.
Another possible use of multiple zones is protection
against spillover eﬀects from blocker tags. For example, if
Alice is carrying a blocker tag and standing in physical prox-
imity to Bob, then her blocker tag may extend its disruptive
eﬀects to the reading of tags carried by Bob. While Bob may
be carrying tags whose serial numbers lie in a privacy zone,
he may wish to have full control over the circumstances in
which they are shielded.
Given a reasonably large collection of privacy zones – say,
one hundred – every person might make use of a blocker
tag protecting a ﬁxed, random zone, and have his or her
items marked accordingly. This would reduce the likelihood
of spillover.
It is important to note that there is a tradeoﬀ between
individual privacy and the number of possible privacy zones
and/or policies. At an extreme, if each blocker tag were to
implement a unique policy, then the policy itself would be
unique identiﬁer! Thus, the set of possible privacy zones
(and likewise the richness of privacy policies) should not be
too large in a given RFID-tag system. Otherwise, there is
a risk of undermining the very property of privacy at whose
enforcement our proposed system of blocker tags aims to
begin with.
One of the drawbacks of blocker tags is that they are eﬀec-
tively an “opt-out” mechanism, i.e., they support a system
in which tags are active by default, and consumers must
take the step of acquiring blockers in order to protect their
privacy.
Blocker tags may in our view, however, be available from
many sources. Merchants may include them for free with
purchased goods or embed them in shopping bags, or con-
sumers may be able to buy them at the checkout counter.
Consumer rights organizations may supply them for nomi-
nal cost. As noted earlier, there is no reason why blocker
tags should not be cheaply and widely available.
5. MALICIOUS BLOCKER TAGS
In this section we explore how blocker tags may be used
maliciously, and discuss defenses against such behavior.
A blocker tag may be misused to circumvent the intended
RFID reader protocol by simulating multiple identiﬁers.
While the legitimate privacy application of the blocker tag
also simulates multiple identiﬁers, the malicious blocker tag
does not respect the boundaries of an allowed privacy zone
of ID’s. A universal blocker tag would hence be malicious
by nature.
RFID readers can be designed to cope with the intended
blocker behavior within the privacy zone, but their basic
functionality requires them to be able to read tags outside of
this zone. Thus the malicious blocker tag eﬀectively mounts
a denial-of-service attack against the RFID reader protocol.
Such attacks might be designed simply to disrupt service, or
may be a component of a scam used by petty thieves. We
focus here on denial-of-service, rather than the full range of
RFID interference strategies.
The malicious blocker tag functions similarly to the pri-
vacy tag described above, simulating actual tags. Regardless
of detection, the attack will be successful, provided that ac-
tual tags in the vicinity may not be distinguished by the
reader.
A selective malicious blocker tag might be more sophisti-
cated. It could attempt to simulate a particular distribution
of tags in order to avoid detection. Regardless of this dis-
tribution, the number of spoofed tags must be large enough
to delay signiﬁcantly the singulation protocol.
Detection of denial-of-service blocker attacks is therefore
relatively straightforward. An attack can be assumed to
be in progress if the number of perceived RFID tags ex-
ceeds some reasonable threshold (for example, 1,000 tags
at a checkout line). Such threshold detection is simple and
robust, as it does not rely on the exact behavior of the mali-
cious blocker tag. In other words, this approach would work
for either universal or selective blocker tags of a malicious
kind.
More sophisticated detection mechanisms might rely on
the use of prescribed tag ID ranges. For example, the reader
could be connected to a database listing every valid tag in
the range of identiﬁers associated with a particular manu-
facturer (corresponding, e.g., to the “EPC manager” in an
EPC). A tag whose identiﬁer lies within the range but isn’t
on the list could be identiﬁed as fraudulent. If tag identiﬁers
are at least partially random, it will be hard for an attacker
to guess a valid product identiﬁer. This defense is also not
foolproof; for example, it does not protect against spooﬁng
valid tag identiﬁers that have been recorded previously by
the attacker. In practice, this approach would also rely on
access to manufacturer databases, which may be impractical
in retail settings.
It is conceivable that expensive, special-purpose readers
could ﬁlter out blocker tags. For example, if a few readers
(or reader antennae) working together could estimate the lo-
cation of the tags, they could identify and screen out signals
originating from a blocker. Of course, existing readers are
not capable of this hypothetical technique, and our feeling
is that it would be challenging to construct readers with this
capability. Our major goal in any case is privacy protection
against ordinary readers.
We emphasize that with the implementation of our pri-
vacy zoning ideas, selective blocker tags as manufactured
for consumer use will not permit abuses like those described
here. Attackers can and may come to deploy malicious
blocker tags whether or not benign blocker tags become
widespread. Thus, concerns about malicious use are not a
good reason for avoiding the adoption of benign blocker tags.
While it is quite possible that there may be some malicious
use of blocker tags, say at a checkout counter, this should
be treated as a misdemeanor equivalent to, say, pouring a
bottle of syrup on the ﬂoor and counter —easily detected
and rather straightforward to handle.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We have proposed the use of blocker tags as a method
for protecting consumer privacy threatened by the perva-
sive use of RFID tags on consumer products. The use of
“selective blocking” by blocker tags enables consumers to
“hide” certain RFID tags from scanning when they want
to, and “reveal” those same tags for scanning when they
want to. By allowing ID preﬁxes to be rewritten, tags can
be moved in or out of “privacy zones” protected by various
blocker tags.
We believe that blocker tags are a potent and very useful
tool for protecting consumer privacy, and recommend the
standardization of their behavior and utilization, along the
lines proposed here.
