**ATT&CK ID:** T1558.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Silver Ticket

Adversaries who possess the password hash of a target service account (e.g., SharePoint, MSSQL) can create forged Kerberos Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) tickets, commonly referred to as silver tickets. These TGS tickets, also known as service tickets, enable unauthorized access to services that rely on Kerberos authentication.
