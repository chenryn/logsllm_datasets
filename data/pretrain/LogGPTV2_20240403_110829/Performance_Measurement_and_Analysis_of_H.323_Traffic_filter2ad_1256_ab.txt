in each path under test. Spirent SmartBits [18] technology was used to qualify
whether NISTnet accurately introduced the delay, jitter and loss settings.
The diﬀerence between the LAN and Internet tests in terms of the NISTnet
settings was that in the LAN environment the end-to-end delay, jitter and loss
were completely controlled by the NISTnet settings; whereas, in the Internet the
network paths already had inherent values of delay, jitter and loss. Therefore a
network path characteristics pre-determination step was required for each test
site before conﬁguring additional end-to-end delay, jitter and loss on NISTnet. To
accurately obtain the inherent network path characteristics, we used data from
OARnet H.323 Beacon, NLANR Iperf and appareNet developed by Apparent
Networks. The end-to-end delay, jitter and loss values conﬁgured on the NISTnet
for the Internet tests were the values obtained by deducting the inherent path
characteristics values from the LAN NISTnet settings.

4 Analysis of Performance Bounds
Sites with research network connections traversing Abilene and GEANT back-
bones had more consistent network path characteristics and overall results. This
is in accord with the popular opinion about the superior performance levels of
these backbones owing to the fact that there is limited cross traﬃc and low uti-
lization levels on these networks. In contrast, sites that had commodity Internet
connections, cable modem and DSL modem last mile connections and also aca-
demic sites such as Brazil and Korea had signiﬁcant variations in network path
characteristics and contributed the most to the variance in the overall results.
Fig. 4 - 6 show the subjective and objective MOS rankings obtained during the
testing for delay, jitter and loss values used in diﬀerent scenarios. The variance
observed in the results is contained well within the performance bounds values
of delay, loss and jitter stated in Section 2.3. This clearly demonstrates that
our LAN results are scalable to the Internet. Also the MOS values plotted in
Fig. 4 - 6 include the values obtained for the tasks involving the H.323 Beacon.
This proves the handy utility of the H.323 Beacon in determining user percei-
ved audiovisual quality in H.323 production systems without remote end-user
intervention.
Fig. 4. Subjective and Objective MOS Vs Delay
The correlation between objective and subjective scores was observed to be
in the above average to strong range. The Pearson correlation for delay, jitter
and loss were 0.827, 0.737, and 0.712 respectively. The reason for all the correla-
tions not being strong can be due to the following reasons: we used the Emodel
objective scores that are modeled after only audio traﬃc streams; participants
at the end-points involved in the testing were from very diverse backgrounds
that included demographics of Videoconferencing Coordinators, Network En-
gineers, Graduate Students, Instructors and IT Managers; and various types of

hardware codec/software codec H.323 end-points were used in the testing. The
various audio codecs observed at the endpoints were GSM, G.711 and G.722 and
the various video codecs observed were H.261, H.262 and H.263.
Table 1 summarizes all the Subjective and Objective Quality Grade Asses-
sments for the LAN/Internet tests. A ’*’ next to a paired-grade in the Result
column indicates that an end-user will more often perceive that Grade of quality
rather than the Grade without the ’*’ in that particular scenario. Values in the
Result column that have more than one Grade and no ’*’ imply that there is an
equal chance of an end-user perceiving either of the Grades of quality for that
scenario.
In the pursuit to identify the most dominating factor amongst delay, jitter
and loss that aﬀects end-user perception of audiovisual quality, we normalized
the scales of these factors and plotted them against both the Subjective and
Objective MOS assessments as shown in Fig. 7 and 8. Each unit in the nor-

malized scale corresponds to a delay of 150ms, jitter of 20ms and loss of 0.5%.
We can observe that end-user perception of audiovisual quality is more sensitive
to changes in jitter than to changes in delay and loss. In fact, the changes in
delay have low impact on the end-user’s perception of the audiovisual quality;
although delay values more than 3 units on the normalized scale are deemed to
be unsuitable for interactive communications [14].
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we determined the performance bounds for network metrics such
as delay, jitter and loss. We use these bounds to determine the impact of network
health on end-user perception of audiovisual quality of H.323 applications. By
emulating various network health scenarios both in the LAN and on the Internet
and by using realistic Videoconferencing tasks, we show that end-user perception
of audiovisual quality is more sensitive to the variations in end-to-end jitter than
to variations in delay or loss. In the Internet tests, by considering almost every
146

possible last-mile connection, we demonstrated that the results we obtained in
the LAN tests scaled consistently to the Internet.
With the valuable network traces obtained from our one-on-one testing with
various sites across the world we are currently studying the eﬀects of jitter buﬀer
sizes on packet discards under various network conditions using many popular
audio and video codecs. We are also investigating eﬀects of various packet sizes
on the end-user perception of audiovisual quality of H.323 applications. The
results of our studies could serve as trouble-shooting information during periods
of suspected network trouble aﬀecting H.323 audio and video-conferences. They
can also foster broader understanding of the behavior of audio and video traﬃc
over the Internet which can then lead to better designed networks in the future.
