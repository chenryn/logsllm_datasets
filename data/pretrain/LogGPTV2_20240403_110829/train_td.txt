ioctl_userfaultfd.2
    mike rapoport
        document replacement of enospc with esrch

        update uffdio_api.features description
            there is no requirement that uffdio_api.features must be zero
            for newer kernels. this field actually defines what features
            space would like to enable.
io_submit.2
    sage weil
        acknowledge possibility of short return
            note that the return value may be a value less than 'nr'
            if not all iocbs were queued at once.
ipc.2
    michael kerrisk
        see also: add svipc(7)
keyctl.2
    eugene syromyatnikov

open.2
    neilbrown
        improve o_path documentation
            - fstatfs is now permitted.
            - ioctl isn't, and is worth listing explicitly
            - o_path allows an automount point to be opened with
              triggering the mount.
prctl.2
seccomp.2
    eugene syromyatnikov
        update pointer to in-kernel seccomp documentation

            see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=196345
set_tid_address.2
    elliott hughes
        note that there's no glibc wrapper for set_tid_address()

    michael kerrisk  [yubin ruan]
        socket() uses the lowest available file descriptor
_syscall.2
    michael kerrisk
        remove redundant comment from example
            a discussion of the nroff source of the manual
            page isn't very useful...
sysfs.2
    michael kerrisk

        revise mnt_force description
            mnt_force does not allow a busy filesystem to be unmounted.  only
            mnt_detach allows that.  mnt_force only tries to abort pending
            transactions, in the hope that might help umount not to block,
            also, other filesystems than nfs support mnt_force.
unshare.2
    eugene syromyatnikov
        update pointer to in-kernel unshare documentation

pow10.3
    michael kerrisk
        note that pow10() is now obsolete in favor of exp10()
            also, the pow10() functions are no longer supported by glibc,
            starting with version 2.27.
sincos.3
    michael kerrisk
        note that sincos() is intended to be more efficient than sin() + cos()
cciss.4
hpsa.4
    eugene syromyatnikov  [don brace, meelis roos]
        mention cciss removal in linux 4.14
            during the linux 4.13 development cycle, the cciss driver has been
            removed in favor of the hpsa driver, which has been amended with
            some legacy board support.

bootparam.7
    eugene syromyatnikov
        update pointer to in-kernel initrd documentation
initrd.4
    eugene syromyatnikov

    michael kerrisk
        see also: add mknod(1) and mknod(2)
host.conf.5
    michael kerrisk
        add cross-reference to hosts(5)
locale.5
    marko myllynen
        refer to existing locales for encoding details
            since i don't think it would make sense to try to have different
            explanation for each glibc version on the locale(5) man page, i'm
            proposing that we apply the below patch so that we refer to
            existing locale definition files in general and not spell out the
            exact format or any certain locale as a definitive guideline.
nologin.5
    michael kerrisk
        add a sentence explaining why nologin is useful
proc.5

        document removal of htab-reclaim sysctl file

            according to historic linux repository commit log.
    eugene syromyatnikov
        add description for cpun lines in /proc/stat

    eugene syromyatnikov
        update reference to kernel's crypto api documentation
tzfile.5
    paul eggert
        sync from tzdb upstream
            this makes tzfile.5 a copy of the tzdb version, except that the
            tzdb version's first line is replaced by man-pages boilerplate.
            the new version documents version 3 format, among other things.
            also, it removes the "summary of the timezone information file
            format" section, which should no longer be needed due to
            improvements in the part of the man page.
capabilities.7
    michael kerrisk
        note semantics for a program that is set-uid-root and has capabilities
            note semantics for a program that is both set-user-id-root and has

        note that a set-uid-root program may have an empty file capability set

        see also: systemd-cgls(1)
cpuset.7
    eugene syromyatnikov
        update pointer to in-kernel cpusets documentation
keyrings.7
    eugene syromyatnikov
        document description restriction for logon keys
            "logon" type has additional check that enforces colon-separated
            prefix in key descriptions.
    eugene syromyatnikov
        add pointers to kernel's documentation
            mostly because of asymmetric-keys.txt, which is outside
            security/keys for some reason.
man-pages.7
    michael kerrisk
        expand the guidance on formatting code snippets
netlink.7

        update pointer to in-kernel unicode terminal support documentation

global changes
--------------
various pages
    michael kerrisk
        consistently use "x86-64", not "x86_64"
            when referring to the architecture, consistently use "x86-64",
            not "x86_64". hitherto, there was a mixture of usages, with
            "x86-64" predominant.
various pages
    g. branden robinson
        replace incorrect uses of latin abbreviation "cf.".
            people seem to be using "cf." ("conferre"), which means "compare",
            to mean "see" instead, for which the latin abbreviation would be
            "q.v." ("quod vide" -> "which see").
            in some cases "cf." might actually be the correct term but it's
            still not clear what specific aspects of a function/system call
            one is supposed to be comparing.
