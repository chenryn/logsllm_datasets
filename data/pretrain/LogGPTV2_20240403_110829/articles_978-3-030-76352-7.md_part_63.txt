1 Introduction
Wildfire, or wildland fire, is a regularly spotted critical phenomenon that can
massively damage human lives, infrastructures, agriculture, and forest ecosys-
tems. It has negative implications on air and water quality, and soil integrity.

Knowledge-Driven Automatic Service Composition for Wildfire Prediction 409
burned area is around 420Mha [9]. Several advances have been made in fire
observations based on physics-based simulators and remote-sensing technolo-
gies, such as satellites (e.g. NASA TERRA), and fire detection sensors (e.g.
Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)), that continuously mon-
itor vegetation distribution and changes. Our PREDICAT (PREDIct natural
CATastrophes) project1, collects EO data from several data sources, such as
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which focuses
on climate and oceans, and the Observatory of Sahara and Sahel (OSS), which
reliesonremotesensingtechnologiesandInternetofThings(IoT)devicesforcli-
mate parameters sensing. Exploiting EO data rises multiple challenges, ranging
from data collection through service composition2 to triggering wildfire alerts.
The issue is that triggering wildfire alerts, is generally realized, once the collec-
tion of all the EO data is available. Existing wildfire detection and prediction
systems mainly focus on accurately building feature observations and manually
definingdomain-rules.Indeed,severalWebservicecompositionapproacheshave
been developed to implement data collection and trigger alerts, based on opti-
mization,decision-makingmethods[10,12],andsemantics[2,8].Whileproducing
candidatesolutions,mostservicecompositiontechniquesneglectknowledgefrom
previously called services or from the application domain. Existing approaches
start from a user request and try to find out a set of optimal services, based
on functional and non-functional parameters. However, the service composition
process for wildfire prediction should be data-driven, which means that the ser-
vice calls alternatives are chosen at run-time depending on the data received
from the previously called services.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach to guide the
EO data collection from IoT devices based on a knowledge-driven process, and
dynamically compose services accessing IoT data for wildfire prediction. We
apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques [1], to guide the service composition
process for EO collection and fire prediction by learning from the data itself
and from historical data related to fire observations. Our solution exploits a
service-based combination of ML and knowledge engineering methodologies, to
automaticallyanddynamicallycomposeservicesforwildfireprediction.Ourcon-
tribution can be summarized as follows: we describe our knowledge-driven ser-
vicecompositionapproachthroughasystemarchitectureforwildfireprediction,

2 Related Work
WebservicecompositionforIoTenvironmentshasbeenoftenemployedtoaccess
multiple IoT devices [18,19]. Authors in [21] proposed a distributed social net-
work approach for IoT management and service composition. An agent-based
middleware was proposed in [22], to handle service composition of logistics ser-
vicesinIoT.Asgharietal.[20]proposedasystematicliteraturereviewonservice
composition approaches in IoT. They aimed to analyze and categorize IoT ser-
vice composition methods into two main categories focusing on functional and
non-functionalproperties.OthereffortswereorientedtowardssemanticWebser-
vice composition [2,3,8], and QoS-aware web service composition [10–12]. Many
approachesemployedEvolutionaryComputing(EC)toautomatethegeneration
of composition solutions and the optimization of the QoS web service composi-
tion by handling the large search spaces of services. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
is used in [10], to propose a composition solution. Genetic Programming is
employed in [13] and [11] to find near-optimal solutions using a fitness func-
tion. Although these solutions are a promising direction, efforts are still needed
for enforcing composition constraints and also, for optimizing the quality of
solutions. Another group of approaches for Qos-aware Web service composition
employtheParticleSwarmOptimisation(PSO),whichsearchesfornear-optimal
solutions by avoiding producing invalid solutions [12]. All these QoS-aware ser-
vice composition approaches do not consider the semantic matchmaking qual-
ity of service compositions. Therefore, another group of researches focused on
the semantic Web service composition using ontology-based semantics, such as
OWL-S, WSML, and SAWSDL [14], to semantically represent the knowledge
conveyed in these Web services [5]. To sum-up, although a large number of
approachesforsemanticwebservicecompositionandQoS-awareservicecompo-
sition exist, they all propose solutions based on the expression of a user query
and not on domain knowledge. Furthermore, these approaches do not dynam-
ically adapt the composition schema when new knowledge is learned, to guide
the data collection process in a knowledge-capable manner.
3 System Architecture for Prediction
Figure1 depicts our layered prediction system architecture [4] that includes
five layers: Semantic layer, Knowledge layer, Application layer, Service Com-
position layer, and Service layer. The Semantic layer contains the domain and
sourceontologies.Itaimstosemanticallydescribethedomainservicesandtheir
related data sources. Hence, the domain ontology represents the environmen-
tal domain concepts related to services for EO data collection. Furthermore,
the source ontology represents the quality of the data sources accessed by their
related services3. The Knowledge layer consists of collecting the EO data from

diverse environmental data sources, provided by the OSS. The environmental
data sources include data from several devices (i.e.: sensors, connected objects,
satellites, etc.). In our case, the knowledge-base contains the main features of
interest of the environmental domain related to the fire occurrences.
TheApplicationlayerwhichconstitutesthemainfocusofthispaper,sums-up
our vision of how to predict wildfire occurrences based on knowledge and learn-
ingmethodologies.TheApplicationlayerusestheEOdatafromtheknowledge-
base. This layer encompasses the Prediction Module, which is composed of two
sub-modules: the Learning Module and the Awareness Module. The Prediction
Module produces alert risk patterns. The Learning Module builds the prediction
model by applying a classification ML algorithm. It takes as inputs the set of
features of interest that shapes the fire (i.e.: temperature, wind speed, humid-
ity, wind direction, etc.) and produces as output the class of fire danger (i.e.:
Moderate, Low, High, Very High, Extreme, Catastrophic, etc.). The supervised
ML algorithm in the Learning Module generates the decision tree (DT), which
is the fire prediction model. This model determines the danger classes of fire,
in the leaf-nodes of the DT. The Awareness Module handles the search for the
important features and the traversal branches of the generated DT. It consists
of traversing all the necessary branches of the DT, from the important feature
node till the leaf-node determining the danger class fire. The first step in the
Awareness Module is to determine the most important feature, upon a classifica-
tiontaskofallthefeaturesofinterest.Themostimportantfeatureisdetermined
by computing the highest score among all the features of interest based on RF
feature selection method. More details about this method are given in Sect.5.1.
In the Service layer, the most important feature is mapped to an abstract ser-
vice, which is a class interface representing its functionality and designed inde-
pendently from particular implementations of services. The abstract service of
the most important feature is then mapped to its service instance. This service
is invoked, executed, and returns a value. The returned service value is then,
compared to the node threshold of the most important feature. Upon this com-
parison,thesetofthetraversedbranches,fromthemostimportantfeaturenode
to the leaf-node, is determined, as a second step in the Awareness Module. The
set of the traversed branches determines whether to traverse the left sub-tree
or the right sub-tree of the most important feature node. Thus, the traversed
path is guided by the most important feature. If the most important feature is
present in multiple nodes in the prediction model, then, we have multiple paths
traversing each of these nodes. Hence, we have multiple services composition
schemas in the Service Composition layer, each of which is built according to
