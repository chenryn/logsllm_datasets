### Interfaces and Source Routing

Interfaces and a source route can override standard routing arrangements. However, the question arises: why should stakeholders be enthusiastic about this? Given that source routes are not effective in today's networks, researchers propose more indirect methods to circumvent provider-selected routing, such as using hosts as intermediate forwarding agents. This kind of overlay network is indeed a tool in the ongoing tussle. A simpler approach might be to compensate the provider for carrying the packets. However, this idea is often met with resistance from both designers and customers, who fear it could lead to an onerous "pay by the byte" scenario, which lacks market appeal.

- **Design Considerations for Provider-Level Source Routing:**
  - The design must acknowledge the need for payment.
  - Payment schemes must be flexible enough to allow the market to determine a fair outcome.
  - Overlay architectures should be evaluated for their ability to isolate tussles and provide choice. A comparison between overlay architectures and integrated global schemes is necessary to understand how each balances the control between providers and consumers, and whether economic distortion is greater in one or the other.

### Trust in the Internet

One of the most profound and irreversible changes in the Internet is the erosion of trust among users. Today, many users do not trust each other, and there are parties with adverse interests, including genuine "bad guys." This implies that mechanisms regulating interaction based on mutual trust should be a fundamental part of the future Internet.

- **User Protection:**
  - Most users prefer to be protected from system penetration attacks, DoS attacks, and other malicious activities. This desire for protection leads to the use of firewalls, which change the Internet from a transparent packet carriage system to a "that which is not permitted is forbidden" network.
  - Firewalls, while inhibiting innovation and new applications, have become a necessity due to poor host security.
  - The principle of "design for choice" suggests that users should be able to choose with whom they interact and the level of transparency they offer. The principle of "tussle isolation" implies that these mechanisms should be separated from other functions.

- **Control and Trust Mechanisms:**
  - There is a technical question about whether end-nodes can implement sufficient trust-related controls or if this control should be delegated to a remote point within the network, such as a "trust-aware firewall."
  - To prevent DoS attacks, protocols could be modified so that end-nodes do not establish state until they verify the identity of the initiating party.
  - The issue of who sets the policy in a firewall (end user or network administrator) remains a tussle, and the solution lies in designing a space for this tussle rather than dictating the outcome.

- **Third-Party Mediation:**
  - Many users do not trust the parties they interact with, such as web sites. Third parties, like credit card companies and public key certificate authorities, mediate and enhance trust.
  - An important engineering principle for future applications is the explicit ability to select third parties to mediate interactions and improve trust.

- **Trust in Software:**
  - Users increasingly distrust the software they run, suspecting it of gathering and sharing information without their knowledge.
  - This problem may be addressed through non-technical means such as regulation and public opinion, but technical solutions, such as mandatory security controls, are also being considered.

### The Role of Identity

- **Identity and Trust:**
  - For communication to be mediated based on trust, parties must know to whom they are talking. A global namespace of Internet users with attached trust assessments is not a viable solution.
  - A framework is needed to translate diverse ways of identifying oneself into lower-level network actions that control access.

- **Anonymity and Accountability:**
  - The Internet's current precept of allowing anonymity is challenged by the need for accountability. While anonymous action may still be possible, many people may choose not to communicate with anonymous users or limit their actions.

### The Tussles of Openness

- **Openness and Innovation:**
  - The Internet's openness to innovation has been a critical success factor, but it is not always in the best interest of service providers, who may prefer closed or proprietary interfaces and vertical integration to avoid competition and maintain high margins.
  - Vertical integration, while constraining certain forms of openness, does not necessarily block innovation. It is important to separate the tussle of vertical integration from the desire to sustain innovation.

- **Transparent Packet Carriage:**
  - Transparent packet carriage, which allows the deployment of new protocols without modifying the network, has fostered innovation. However, transparency is not the same as openness, though they are related.

### Revisiting Old Principles

- **End-to-End Arguments:**
  - One of the most respected Internet design principles is the end-to-end arguments, which state that mechanisms should be placed at the end nodes rather than in the network core. This principle supports innovation and reliability.
  - The erosion of trust, the desire for ISP control, the need for data capture, and the improvement of applications have led to a reduction in transparency, challenging the end-to-end principle.

By addressing these tussles and principles, we can better design the future of the Internet, ensuring it remains open, innovative, and trustworthy.
