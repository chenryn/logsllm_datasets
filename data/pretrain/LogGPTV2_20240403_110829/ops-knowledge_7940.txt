User: I need to install on one of my Windows PC's some software that will periodically send a short HTTP POST request to my remote development server. The request is always the same and should get sent every minute.
What would you recommend as the best approach for that?
The things I considered are:
1. Creating a Windows service
2. Using a script in python (I have cygwin installed)
3. Scheduled task using a batch file (although I don't want the black cmd window to pop up in my face every minute) 
Thanks for any additional ideas or hints on how to best implement it.
Assistant: If you have cygwin, you probably have cron - run a python script from your crontab.
