User: I am just starting to learn Python and I am using Windows 10. I downloaded and installed Python 3.4.3. But everytime I open Python from my Desktop or from C:\Python\python.exe it just opens a black command prompt without any Menu options like File menu, Edit Menu, Format Menu etc. I can't see any colors of the code, it's just black screen with white text. I searched about it on internet and came to know that what I am opening is the Editor winodws and I need to open Shell Window in order to have access to all of those options and features. I can't figure out where is the .exe of Shell Window and with what name is it? Please help me.
P.S. I also tried to open pythonw.exe that was present in the Python folder where it was installed, but nothing opened.
Assistant: If your using Windows 10 just type in idle where it says: "Type here for search"
