**ATT&CK ID:** T1218.007  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Msiexec

Adversaries may abuse `msiexec.exe` to execute malicious payloads. `Msiexec.exe` is a command-line utility for the Windows Installer, typically used to execute installation packages (`.msi` files). This binary is often digitally signed by Microsoft, which can make it appear more legitimate and evade detection.

By leveraging `msiexec.exe`, attackers can proxy the execution of their malicious code, potentially bypassing security measures that might otherwise block or detect the direct execution of suspicious files.
