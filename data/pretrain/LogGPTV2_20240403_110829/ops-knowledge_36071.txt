User: I want to change the default environment (the folder where my Canopy files are stored), which I previously set to 'Documents' folder. But now I want to change the folder. If I just delete the folders, Canopy creates them again automatically, indicating that somewhere inside its logs it has saved the default location address, and I want to change this default location address.
Assistant: You can change the root path for the file browser by modifying the variable "root_paths" in the file ./canopy/preferences.ini under the section [file_browser]
