To change the default storage location for your Canopy files, you need to update the configuration settings. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you modify the default folder:

1. **Locate the Configuration File:**
   - Open the Canopy preferences file, `preferences.ini`, which is typically found in the Canopy installation directory. The exact path may vary depending on your operating system:
     - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\preferences.ini`
     - **macOS:** `~/Library/Preferences/enthought/canopy/User/preferences.ini`
     - **Linux:** `~/.canopy/User/preferences.ini`

2. **Edit the Configuration File:**
   - Open the `preferences.ini` file with a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, or any other text editor of your choice).
   - Navigate to the `[file_browser]` section.
   - Look for the `root_paths` variable. This variable specifies the default folders used by Canopy.

3. **Update the Default Folder:**
   - Modify the `root_paths` value to the new desired folder path. For example, if you want to change the default folder to `D:\MyCanopyFiles`, you would update the line as follows:
     ```ini
     root_paths = D:/MyCanopyFiles
     ```

4. **Save and Close the File:**
   - Save the changes and close the text editor.

5. **Restart Canopy:**
   - Restart Canopy to apply the changes. The new default folder should now be in effect.

By following these steps, you can successfully change the default storage location for your Canopy files. If you encounter any issues, ensure that the new folder path is correctly specified and that you have the necessary permissions to access it.
