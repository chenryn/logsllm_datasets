Challenge Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.152 Safari/537.36`.
"Run tests" button doesn't work after this manipulation:
  1. Create an anchor("cat photos") as described in the task(current and a previous one)
  2. On the next page(the next task) you will still have that link(part of the task). And if you're curious enough, you try to click that link you made on the right of the screen.
  3. "Oh, nothing happens, developers did well".
  4. Do the task and press "Run tests"
  5. Nothing happens  
It doesn't work either by clicking on the button or pressing 'CTRL+ENTER'  
If you update the page and do not click that link, it passes okay. Just a
minor bug that I felt I should report.  
Thanks for an amazing website.
