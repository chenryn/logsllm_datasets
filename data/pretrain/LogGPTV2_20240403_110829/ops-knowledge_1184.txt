User: How to set the access control permissions of the Git warehouse to ensure the security of the code?
Assistant: To ensure the access control authority of the Git repository, the following measures can be taken: 1. Use the SSH protocol to connect to the Git server, avoiding the transmission of passwords or tokens in plain text. 2. Configure user access permissions on the Git server, and set different permissions for users with different roles, such as read-only, read-write, and so on. 3. Restrict IP address access on the Git server, and only allow users within a specific IP address range to access. 4. Configure the access log of the Git warehouse, check and check the access records of the warehouse in time, and find abnormal situations in time. 5. When creating a Git repository, set a strong password policy to avoid guessing or cracking. 6. Regularly back up the Git repository to ensure data security. (Note: If you are using Git warehouse hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab, then the backup and security issues are the responsibility of the service provider, and you can set the corresponding security policies according to the security guidelines provided by the service provider.)
