Assistant: This log chunk shows a series of events related to network connections. The kernel is detecting Thunderbolt HPD packets, changing channels, and setting BTCoex Config. Symptomsd is hashing a primary key, and QQ is failing to connect. Networkd is performing CrazyIvan46, and the wl0 is roaming or switching channels. UserEventAgent is detecting an inactive connection, and en0 is changing BSSIDs. Locationd is failing to connect, and corecaptured is capturing logs and refreshing subscriptions. Finally, a capture event is received.
