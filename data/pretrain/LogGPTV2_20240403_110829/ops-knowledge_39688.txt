User: Commonly on most unix systems there is a distinction between $PREFIX/bin and $PREFIX/sbin. When installing a piece of software the administrator decides about what $PREFIX is, but the author decides which programs are suitable for regular users and which are not. With Python's distutils a set of scripts can be defined and they are installed to $PREFIX/bin. So how to install a script to the corresponding sbin directory?
Note that in this case solutions targeting only Linux are welcome, because other parts of the software in question depend on iptables.
Assistant: For distutils, we are working on support to install scripts into prefix/sbin.
