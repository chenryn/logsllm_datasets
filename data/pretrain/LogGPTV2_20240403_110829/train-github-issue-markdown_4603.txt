Proposal regarding modification of the NumPy Docstring Standard
Under the heading "Method docstrings" in the section "Documenting classes"
Reword as follows:
Do not include "self" in the list of parameters. Otherwise, follow  
the docstring standard for an ordinary function, _except_ when the  
method duplicates a function in the package namespace. In such  
cases, simply provide the brief summary and the See Also section, whose
content should simply be ..
On those rare occasions when a method does some additional, significant
processing (e.g., parameter manipulation) before (or after) handing off to a
nominally equivalent function, then document only the added functionality in
the method, using only the sections needed to do so, and for the rest refer to
the function. In general, the guiding principle is to document behavior where
it is implemented in the source code, with ufuncs considered to "live" in
their function implementation rather than any method implementation they may
have.
