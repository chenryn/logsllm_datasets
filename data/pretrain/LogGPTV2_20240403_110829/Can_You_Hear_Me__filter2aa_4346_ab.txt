That `ALEM.3` repeats at least 41 times (even more, sometimes identified by `strings` as part of a larger string). In this case too, we can't find it in Google, but it must have some significance.
The second one is the challenge title:
> Can you hear it?
This implies some kind of sound file format.
Now, if we think of `ALEM` in the context of sound files, it sounds very much like [LAME](https://lame.sourceforge.io/), the famous MP3 encoder. But the file signature doesn't match MP3! According to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures), MP3 signatures are:
| Hex Signature | Offset | Filename Extension | Description | 
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ----------- |
| (-) `FF FB`  (-) `FF F3`  (-) `FF F2` | 0 | mp3 |  	MPEG-1 Layer 3 file without an ID3 tag or with an ID3v1 tag (which's appended at the end of the file) |
| (-) `49 44 33` | 0 | mp3 | MP3 file with an ID3v2 container  |
We don't have that, we have `F3 FF`. It is pretty close to `FF F3` though. And we did see `ALEM` earlier, which is close to `LAME`. So what if we do the most trivial thing we can think of, and swap every two bytes?
```python
from pathlib import Path
import os
FILE = "Can_You_Hear_Me"
with open(FILE, "rb") as f, open(f"{Path(FILE).stem}_out.mp3", "wb") as o:
    file_size = os.path.getsize(FILE)
    for _ in range(file_size // 2):
        b1 = f.read(1)
        b2 = f.read(1)
        o.write(b2)
        o.write(b1)
    if (file_size % 2 == 1):
        o.write(f.read(1))
```
Output:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/matrix/Can_You_Hear_Me# python3 solve.py
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/matrix/Can_You_Hear_Me# file Can_You_Hear_Me_out.mp3
Can_You_Hear_Me_out.mp3: MPEG ADTS, layer III, v2,  32 kbps, 24 kHz, Monaural
```
We got a legal MP3 file! It spells out the flag, which is `MCL{I_KNEW_THAT_I_HEARD_SOMETHING}`
