ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we provide a brief summary of the 7th International 
Workshop  on  Managing  Insider  Security  Threats  (MIST  2015). 
MIST  2015  is  held  in  conjunction  with  the  22nd  ACM 
Conference  on  Computer  and  Communications  Security  (ACM 
CCS  2015).  The  workshop  aims  to  showcase  the  most  recent 
challenges  and  advanced  technologies  for  managing  insider 
security threats. 
Categories and Subject Descriptors 
K.6.5 [Security and Protection]: Invasive software (e.g., viruses, 
worms,  Trojan  horses),  Unauthorized  access  (e.g.,  hacking, 
phreaking).  
General Terms 
Insider  threats,  Data  leakage  prevention,  Cyber  security  and 
defense. 
Keywords 
Insider  threats,  Data  leakage  prevention,  Cyber  security  and 
defense 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, insider attacks by authorized users have considerably 
increased  with  great  potential  to  cause  critical  damages  [1].  For 
example,  malicious  insiders  can  harm  their  organizations  by 
stealing intellectual property, sabotaging corporate IT systems, or 
misusing IT systems to execute financial fraud. However, in spite 
of  rigorous  researches,  it  still  remains  one  of  the  most  difficult 
challenges in the areas of security to prevent, detect, and respond 
to insider threats and attacks [2, 3].  
Motivated  by  this,  the  MIST  workshop  has  been  annually  held 
since  2009  with  the  purpose  of  providing  a  forum  for  the  most 
recent  challenges  and  advances  in  defending  against  insider 
security threats and information leakages as follows:

2.  MIST PROGRAM 
MIST 2015 is a one-day workshop, which takes place on October 
16, 2015 in conjunction with the ACM CCS 2015 in The Denver 
Marriot  City  Center,  Denver,  Colorado,  USA.  The  workshop 
provides  six  oral  and  four  poster  presentations.    Moreover,  it  is 
powered by the following invited talk and panel discussion: 
 Invited talk: Dr. William R. Claycomb 
“Detecting Insider Threats: Who Is Winning the Game?” 
 Panel discussion: Prof. Kangbin Yim et al. 
“Cyber Threats to Industrial Control Systems” 
3.  WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS 
Ilsun  You  (general  co-chair)  received  his  M.S.  and  Ph.D. 
degrees  in  Computer  Science  from  Dankook  University,  Seoul, 
Korea  in  1997  and  2002,  respectively.  Also,  he  obtained  his 
second  Ph.D.  degree  from  Kyushu  University,  Japan  in  2012. 
Now, he is working as an associate professor at Soon Chun Hyang 
University, Republic of Korea. Dr. You has published more than 
120  papers  and  30  special  issues  in  his  main  areas  including
