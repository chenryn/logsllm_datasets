DrawNet++: a Flexible Framework for Building Dependability Models

1. DrawNet++ quick overview and context
The DrawNet++ project addresses the compositional
construction of dependability models [3, 4]. Its main goals
are to provide: a) a GUI to any graph-based formalism; b)
a support to the design process of dependability models,
according to concepts inspired by object orientation (OO);
c) a user friendly front-end for different classes of analy-
sis/simulation tools.
Such features enforce the rapid prototyping and the reuse
of sub-models. The formalisms adopted to implement the
(sub)models may differ, by allowing to study both compo-
sitional problems related to the usage of a single speciﬁca-
tion formalism and interoperability issues within a multi-
formalism environment. A prototype post-processor has
been implemented to interface a few analysis/simulation
tools and retrieve/show performance results. By now, Para-
metric Fault Tree (PFT) [1] and Stochastic Well Formed
Nets (SWN)[2], are supported. An XML description of
the user deﬁned models is generated by the tool and XSL
styles are used to translate the XML representation into a
syntax suitable for the speciﬁc analysis tool. We use the
DrawNet++ framework to build compositional SWN mod-
els and models of highly redundant systems by combin-
ing PFT with SWN [1]: since state space analysis tools
are needed to represent dependencies between components,
repair, transient faults etc, we model them by SWN sub-
models and compose such predeﬁned blocks with a SWN
model of the system obtained by automatically translating
a PFT model.
In this context we use the DrawNet++ a)
to deﬁne and draw composed models (e.g. PFT and SWN
blocks); b) to produce the syntax representation of the entire
model and c) to present the results computed by the solvers.
2. DrawNet++ demonstration
The goal of this demonstration is to present (1) the deﬁni-
tion of a graph based formalism, including compositionality

issues; (2) some guidelines for a dependability model con-
struction cycle from PFTs to SWNs; (3) the OO capabilities
that can be exploited in the model design process.
The ﬁrst point addresses the XML speciﬁcation of a
graph based formalism and the automatic creation of a GUI
to edit and manipulate (sub)models (Fig.1). The second
point deals with the usage of XSL style sheets and the post-
processing of the models in order to operate the conversion
from a PFT model into a SWN model; this will be demon-
strated by means of a case study [1]. Finally, the third point
is aimed to show the mechanisms to deﬁne classes and ob-
jects that represent sets of system component models, create
hierarchies, implement information hiding capabilities, and
specify template objects.
