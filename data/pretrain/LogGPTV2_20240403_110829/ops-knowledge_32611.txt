User: How can we call the CLI executables commands using Python
For example i have 3 linux servers which are at the remote location and i want to execute some commands on those servers like finding the version of the operating system or executing any other commands. So how can we do this in Python. I know this is done through some sort of web service (SOAP or REST) or API but i am not sure....... So could you all please guide me.
Assistant: Depends on how you want to design your software.
You could do stand-alone scripts as servers listening for requests on specific ports,
or you could use a webserver which runs python scripts so you just have to access a URL.
REST is one option to implement the latter.
You should then look for frameworks for REST development with python, or if itâ€™s simple logic with not so many possible requests can do it on your own as a web-script.
