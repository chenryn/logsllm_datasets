# Tabnabbing
## Introduction
When you open a link in a new tab ( target="_blank" ), the page that opens in a new tab can access the initial tab and change it's location using the window.opener property.
## How to find
```html
```
## How to Exploit
1. Attacker posts a link to a website under his control that contains the following JS code:
    ```html
    ```
2. He tricks the victim into visiting the link, which is opened in the browser in a new tab.
3. At the same time the JS code is executed and the background tab is redirected to the website evil.com, which is most likely a phishing website.
