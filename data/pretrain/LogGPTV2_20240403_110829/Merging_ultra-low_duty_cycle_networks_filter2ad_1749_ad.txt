### Network Synchronization and Clustering Performance

**Performance in Small Topologies:**
In a small 64-node topology, the system operates acceptably, with all nodes converging to a single cluster within an average of about 1,000 rounds (approximately 8 minutes). However, the performance varies across 32 runs. Figure 4a illustrates the standard deviation of start times as a function of the round number, averaged over these runs. The GMAC configuration shows consistent convergence, typically stabilizing after around 1,000 rounds.

**Challenges in Larger Topologies:**
In larger topologies, such as 256-node and 1,024-node networks, the system faces more significant challenges. In the 256-node network, only six out of thirty-two runs achieved full synchronization within a simulated hour. In the 1,024-node network, the majority of nodes converged, but not all runs synchronized successfully. This issue is discussed in Section IV-B.

**Proposed Solution:**
To address the synchronization problem, we propose using cluster IDs instead of arbitrary identifiers. Figures 5e and 5f demonstrate the performance of a 1,024-node run using this new configuration. The use of cluster IDs significantly improves performance, enabling the network to synchronize in approximately 1,000 rounds, similar to the 64-node network. By utilizing cluster IDs, we can consistently synchronize even in large 1,024-node networks.

**Analysis of Synchronization Issues:**
To understand the causes of the synchronization difficulties, we analyze the results from individual runs. The three graphs on the left side of Figure 5 show the differences in start times between each node and the average start time for each round. The right-side graphs display the percentage of nodes in the largest cluster. For example, Figure 5a shows a 256-node run that properly converges to a single cluster around round 2,500. In contrast, Figure 5b shows a 1,024-node run where nodes fail to converge, indicating the presence of multiple clusters.

**Detection Mechanisms:**
GMAC currently uses an active detection mechanism. We evaluate the performance of a new passive detection mechanism. In Figure 6c, we compare the average behavior of the passive detection mechanism over 32 simulated runs. Although it takes longer to converge, the passive detection mechanism performs better in larger topologies. The consistent ordering of clusters is an essential element that overcomes the limitations of the active detection mechanism in larger networks.

**Merge Protocol and Cyclic Behavior:**
The merge protocol can handle two clusters, but if there are more than two, cyclic behavior may occur, preventing complete synchronization. Figure 5b demonstrates this issue, showing that the network converges to bounds of about ±100 μs but fails to fully synchronize. To mitigate this, we examine the performance of our proposed solutions, including the use of cluster IDs and a new merge protocol.

**Notification Mechanism:**
Finally, we explore the enhancement of the notification mechanism. When one node detects another and decides to join it, notifying its already synchronized neighbors can save energy. Each neighbor alerted by a merge message can then update its cluster information, leading to faster and more efficient synchronization.

**Conclusion:**
Based on these findings, we conclude that the use of cluster IDs and the new merge protocol significantly improve the performance of the system, especially in larger networks. The passive detection mechanism, while slower, provides superior performance in terms of consistency and reliability. Future work will focus on further optimizing these mechanisms to ensure robust and efficient network synchronization.
