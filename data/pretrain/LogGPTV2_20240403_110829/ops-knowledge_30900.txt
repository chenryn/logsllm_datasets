User: How to set network ACL rules to protect database server?
Assistant: To set network ACL rules to protect the database server, follow the steps below: 1. Determine the IP address and port number of the database server to be protected. 2. Create a network ACL rule to prohibit external IP addresses from accessing the port of the database server. The following rules can be used: a. Allow traffic from all local IP addresses. b. Prohibit all external IP addresses from accessing the database server port. 3. If you need to allow specific external IP addresses to access the database server, you can add allowed rules. It is recommended to allow only necessary IP addresses to access the database server. For example, if there is a web application that needs to access the database, only the IP address where the web application is located is allowed to access the database. 4. Consider setting up inbound and outbound rules. Inbound rules restrict external traffic to the database server, and outbound rules restrict external traffic to the database server. This increases network security and reduces the potential attack surface. 5. Regularly review and update network ACL rules. The network environment and business requirements may change, so it is necessary to regularly review and update network ACL rules to ensure network security. NOTE: The above rules are general recommendations and may not apply in all situations. Appropriate adjustments should be made according to the actual situation.
