User: Why using Git is a good code management solution? How to create branches in Git? How to merge changes into master branch?
Assistant: Using Git as a code management solution has the following advantages: 1. Distributed version control to facilitate team collaboration: Git supports multi-author distributed development, each developer can work independently and submit code changes, and can also merge code changes into the master branch, avoiding a single point of failure. 2. Significantly reduce the risk of code loss: Git can record every change, avoiding accidental deletion or overwriting. All versions of the code can be easily restored. 3. Manage code change track: Git records every change to code through version control, which is convenient for team members to coordinate development, check code changes, and ensure security. How to create branches in Git? Creating a branch in Git is very simple, you can follow the steps below: 1. Use the command to enter git branch <branchname> to create a new branch. 2. To switch to the newly created branch, you can use the command git checkout <branchname> or git switch <branchname>. 3. When a modification is made and submitted in a branch, the change is submitted in that branch. How to merge changes into master branch? To merge the changes in the branch into the main branch, you can use the following commands: 1. First switch back to the main branch and use the git checkout main command. 2. Then use the git merge <branchname> command to merge the main branch with the branch. 3. The changes made in the branch will be merged into the main branch, and then the changes for the next version can be submitted.
