Figure 1.6: Using nslookup with ‐querytype=mx
Instead of –querytype=mx, you can use any of the following:
HINFO
Specifies a computer's CPU and type of operating system
UNIFO
Specifies the user information
MB
Specifies a mailbox domain name
MG
Specifies an email group member
MX
Specifies the email server
Tracert
So, now you know that all machines that are on a network need to have an IP address. I live in Denver, Colorado, and one of my best friends, Ryan, lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. When I send him a message, it does not travel from my house through the wires directly to his house. It goes through “hops” (and not the beer kind, unfortunately for him). These hops are the routers between us.
Tracert is a cool diagnostic utility. It will determine the route the message takes from Denver to Albuquerque by using ICMP echo packets sent to the destination. You've seen ICMP in action before—with the ping command.
ICMP is one of the Internet's original protocols used by network devices to send operational information or error messages. ICMP is not usually used to send data between computers, with the exception of ping and traceroute. It is used to report errors in the processing of datagrams.
Each router along the path subtracts the packets TTL value by 1 and forwards the packet, giving you the time and the intermediate routers between you and the destination. Tracert will print the trace of the packet's travels.
Why is this an important part of your toolkit? This is how you find out where a packet gets stopped or blocked on the enterprise network. There may be a router with a configuration issue. Firewalls can be configured to filter packets. Perhaps your website is responding slowly. If packets are being dropped, this will be displayed in the tracert as an asterisk.
This is a good tool when you have many paths that lead to the same destination but several intermediary routers are involved.
One caveat before Lab 1.4: As I mentioned previously, most of my strengths lie in Windows machines. If you are on a Linux or Mac/Unix‐type operating system (OS), then you will want to use the tool traceroute. The commands tracert and traceroute are basically the same thing. The difference lies in which OS you are troubleshooting. If you want to get supremely technical, in Linux the command sends a UDP packet. In Windows, it sends an ICMP echo request.
LAB 1.4: TRACERT
Open a command prompt or a terminal window.
At the command prompt, type tracert 8.8.8.8 and press Enter.
In Figure 1.7, you can see the hops my machine takes to reach that public Google DNS server. How many hops does yours take?
Figure 1.7: Using tracert, counting hops
Now try tracert –d 8.8.4.4.
This is another public Google DNS server, but now tracert will not try to resolve DNS while counting the hops.
For fun, try tracert 127.0.0.1. Why is it only one hop?
NetStat
Mathematical statistics is the collection, organization, and presentation of data to be used in solving problems. When you analyze statistics, you are going to use probability to fix issues. For example, in a room of 23 people, there is a 50 percent probability that two of those people share the same birthday. In cybersecurity, a birthday attack is a type of cryptographic attack that exploits the math behind the birthday statistic. This attack can be used to find collisions in a hash function. In our world of networking, learning your network statistics can be quite valuable.
NetStat is a network utility tool that displays networking connections (incoming and outgoing), routing tables, and some other details such as protocol statistics. It will help you gauge the amount of network traffic and diagnose slow network speeds. Sounds simple, yes? From a cybersecurity standpoint, how quickly can you tell which ports are open for incoming connections? What ports are currently in use? What is the current state of connections that already exist?
The output from the netstat command is used to display the current state of all the connections on the device. This is an important part of configuration and troubleshooting. NetStat also has many parameters to choose from to answer the questions presented in the previous paragraph. One thing to remember about the parameters discussed next is that when you type them into your cmd shell, you can literally squish them together. For example, when I am teaching my Metasploit Pro class, we launch a proxy pivot via a Meterpreter shell and scan another network segment. (That might sound like gibberish now, but just finish the book.) How do you know what is actually transpiring on the compromised system? Using the netstat command and the options –a for all and –n for addresses and ports, you will have a list of all active network conversations this machine is having, as shown in Figure 1.8.
Figure 1.8: NetStat finding active connections
To translate the figure, when running netstat on your host, you may see both 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1 in this list. You already know what a loopback address is. A loopback address is accessible only from the machine you're running netstat on. The 0.0.0.0 is basically a “no particular address” placeholder. What you see after the 0.0.0.0 is called a port.
One of my favorite explanations of ports is that you have 65,536 windows and doors in your network ranging from 0 to 65,535. Computers start counting at 0. Network admins are constantly yelling, “Shut the windows and close the doors—you're letting the data out!” Ports can be TCP or UDP. Simply put, TCP means there is a connection made between the host and the destination. UDP doesn't worry about whether there is a connection made. Both TCP and UDP have 65,535 ports available to them. This was the highest number that could be represented by a 16‐bit, or 2‐byte, number. You may see this represented mathematically as 216 – 1.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains an official assignment of port numbers for specific uses. Sometimes this list becomes antiquated at the same time new technologies are becoming available. Some of the most common ones you might see are the “well‐known” ports, which are 0–1023. Looking at the list in the previous figure, you see this machine is listening on port 135. Port 135 is traditionally used for a service called epmap/loc‐srv. That should tell you, among other things in Figure 1.8, that this is a Windows host. When a Windows host wants to connect to an RPC service on a remote machine, it checks for port 135.
The next port that is listening is 443. Most IT professionals memorize this port early in their career. Port 443 is Hypertext Transfer Protocol over TLS/SSL—better known as HTTPS. HTTPS is the authentication of a website that is being accessed and protecting the confidentiality of the data being exchanged. Ports from 1023 all the way up to 49151 are “registered” ports. Above that, you have dynamic or private ports.
NetStat is an abbreviation for “network statistics.” If a host is not listening on the correct port for a specific service, then no communication can occur. Take another step in your network path, and these ports may be listening, but this does not mean that a firewall is allowing the traffic to get to the device. To test that hypothesis, you can temporarily disable your host‐based firewall causing the networking issue.
Among my favorite netstat commands are the statistics options shown in Figure 1.9. In Lab 1.5, you'll use the netstat command.
Figure 1.9: NetStat statistics
LAB 1.5: NETSTAT
Open a command prompt or a terminal window.
At the command prompt, type netstat –help.
When the prompt is available, use netstat –an –p TCP.
Next try netstat –sp TCP.
INVESTIGATING THE UNEXPECTED
You're sitting in your office, putting the final touches on a presentation that you're giving in an hour on cybersecurity trends that your specific industry is experiencing to the C‐level employees at your company. You're feeling confident with your data. You are hitting the Save button after every major change. You're concentrating on the agenda in your presentation when a balloon in your task pane from your antivirus software pops up and notifies you that an IP address will be blocked for 600 seconds.
As most end users do, you click the X with no hesitation and continue building your presentation. Then you notice you have mail in your inbox from your firewall. It is an alert notification. You start to worry less about your presentation and start thinking a possible breach is being attempted against your host.
You open a command shell and drop a netstat –nao. Not only will this give you the protocol, local/foreign address, and state but also the process identifier (PID) associated with that communication. You can easily get overwhelmed by the data displayed, but check your taskbar. Are there any network‐centric applications running? Close your browsers and try netstat –nao again.
Did anything change? Are there any foreign addresses or odd port numbers that you've never seen before?
Two ports to be wary of are 4444 and 31337. Port 4444 is the default port that Metasploit will use as a default listening port. Port 31337 spells eleet.
Leet speak originated in the 1980s when message boards discouraged the discussion of hacking. The purposeful misspelling of words and substitution of letters for numbers was a way to indicate you were knowledgeable about hackers and circumvent the message board police. When we substitute letters with numbers to enhance our passwords, we are using leet speak for good.
If either of these two ports shows up in your NetStat statistics, it's time for a procedure that has been previously agreed upon to kick in. Either pull the network cable on this machine or alert your incident response (IR) team so they can triage the situation and make the best decision on how to stop the attack. My own personal recommendation is that if you have an IR team, use it. If you pull the plug on an attacker, you lose valuable forensic information.
PuTTY
Up until now, all the tools discussed are embedded in your operating systems. This tool will require a little more effort on your part. PuTTY is a free, open‐source terminal emulation, serial console, and network file transfer program. Originally written for Windows, it has evolved to be used with other operating systems. PuTTY is an amazingly versatile tool that allows you to gain secure remote access to another computer and is most likely the most highly used SSH client for the Microsoft Windows platform.
I believe that many IT professionals who have been in the industry for a while lose track of where we have been. We keep adding knowledge and experience and expertise to our repertoire and think, “Everyone should know that.” As an educator, I am not allowed to do that. It's my job to show you how to use all these new shiny things in your toolbox. I can hear some people saying, “You had me until SSH!”
Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol for creating an encrypted channel over an unencrypted network. The Internet is way unsecured. You don't want your data out there in the World Wide Web dangling freely for all to see! SSH provides a computer administrator with a safe way to reach a system that is remote using strong authentication and secure, encrypted data transmission. There have been times as an administrator when part of my responsibilities were to manage computers I could not reach out and physically touch—execute commands or move files from one computer to another. SSH is the protocol most hosts support. An SSH server, by default, will listen on TCP port 22.
As I mentioned earlier in this chapter, SSH creates an encrypted channel to communicate over. The first version of SSH debuted in 1995. Brad Pitt was the Sexiest Man Alive, Mel Gibson's Braveheart won Best Picture, and Match.com was new and the only online dating site. A lot…and I mean a lot has changed since then. Over the years, several flaws were found in SSH1, and it is no longer used. The current SSH2 was adopted in 2006 and uses a stronger encryption algorithm to improve security. As of yet, there are no known exploitable vulnerabilities in SSH2, although there have been rumors that the National Security Agency (NSA) may be able to decrypt some SSH2 traffic.
In Lab 1.6, you'll use PuTTY.
LAB 1.6: PuTTY
You can download a copy of PuTTY from www.putty.org. There will be a link on the page that takes you to the package file. Make sure you are getting the correct version for the hardware you are running. One size does not fit all.
Double‐click the file you just downloaded. Follow the instructions until you finish the installation and then open PuTTY by double‐clicking the icon that looks like two old computers linked together with a lightning bolt.
When the software starts, a PuTTY Configuration window should open, such as what you see in Figure 1.10. The window pane on the left side lists the categories: Session, Terminal, Window, and Connection. The right side of the window will change depending on what category you have selected on the left.
Figure 1.10: PuTTY Configuration window
In the Session view, enter the domain name or IP address you want to connect to. Port 22 specifies that you will be using SSH. The Connection Type setting lets you choose one of the following options:
Raw: This is usually used by developers for testing.
Telnet: Telnet is no longer secure. Passwords are sent in clear text. This is a bad idea.
Rlogin: This is legacy, which means old (like 1982 old). It uses port 513 and only connects Unix to Unix. Ignore it.
SSH: This is the protocol most hosts support. An SSH server, by default, will listen on TCP port 22.
Serial: This is used for controlling some physical machinery or communication devices.
After you have supplied the IP or domain address, you should get a terminal window, which will ask for your credentials. If you are able to supply them, you will have a command‐line terminal on the machine you just accessed. Some useful commands include the following:pwd
Present working directory
cd
Change directory
cd ~
Go to the home folder
ls
List files
ls –h
List files with the size
cp
Copy a file
cp –r
Copy a folder with all the files inside
mv
Move a file
mkdir
Make a directory
rm
Delete a file
The session will terminate when you press Ctrl+D.
NOTE
The first time you connect another system, you may be prompted to accept the server's SSH key or certificate. It might have some wording like “The server's host key is not cached in the registry.” You see an example in Figure 1.11. This is normal. When you click Yes, you are establishing trust between the two hosts.
Figure 1.11: PuTTY security alert
I truly hope that I have given you a foundation to start to build on and that you have added these tools to your cybersecurity toolkit. Some of these tools may have just been a review for you, and some of them might have been new. These tools will help you not only with troubleshooting networks but with securing them as well.
CHAPTER 2Troubleshooting Microsoft Windows
WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS CHAPTER:
RELI
PSR
PathPing
MTR
Sysinternals
GodMode
In 2012, I left the great state of Louisiana for Colorado to take a position with the Communications‐Electronics Command (CECOM) at Fort Carson for the U.S. Army. My job was to train soldiers for information assurance (IA). The Department of Defense has a requirement that any full‐ or part‐time military service member or contractor with privileged access must have certain computer certifications. This was known as DoDD 8570. My role was to teach these certification classes to help soldiers achieve the correct IA level needed so they could perform their job.
My commandant Ryan Hendricks is a networking guru, and he wanted to stay in his Cisco classes. Someone was needed to teach A+, Network+, Security+, Server+, CASP, and CISSP as well as Microsoft Active Directory, SCCM, and SharePoint. We both held the opinion that it wasn't fair for us to teach the class if we didn't hold the certification. He continued down the Cisco path, and I skipped down the CompTIA/Microsoft certification path.
While studying for these certifications, I had many “aha” moments that are still relative today. In fact, when I am teaching my certification classes for Rapid7, I often take a few moments while everyone is getting settled into his or her seat after lunch to show class members some of these cool troubleshooting tricks for Windows. It's a bit of a bonus for coming back to class on time.
Even seasoned professionals who work with massive networks and have years of experience have uttered a few choice words when they see tools that are meant to make their life easier after they've been doing it the hard way for years and years. If nearly 90 percent of your network is Windows, you need these tools to make your administrative life easier.
RELI
I call this tool RELI because when you type these four letters in the Windows search box on the taskbar, there is usually nothing else to choose from besides this one, the Reliability History/Monitor. RELI traces its roots all the way back to Windows Vista. It allows you to see the stability of a machine in a timeline. When you start typing it in the Start menu, you'll notice the name of the tool displays as Reliability History. Once you open the tool, it renames itself to Reliability Monitor. (Thank you, Microsoft.)
Reliability Monitor will build a graph for you of important events, application and Windows failures, and updates and other information that might be important. Figure 2.1 shows the graph that gets generated from application, Windows, and miscellaneous failures. In Lab 2.1, you'll use RELI.
Figure 2.1: Reliability Monitor graph
LAB 2.1: RELI
To open this tool, open the Start menu and begin typing reli.
When you see the blue flag icon next to Reliability History in your Start menu, press the Enter key. Wait while it builds your graphic timeline.
Above the graphic in the upper left, notice you can shift your timeline view from Days to Weeks.
The first three lines of the graph indicated on the right side are the application, Windows, and miscellaneous failures this system has experienced. These can include when a program stopped working or when Windows did not properly shut down. It is a fantastic indicator of a Blue/Black Screen of Death (BSOD). This will be displayed as a red circle with a white X inside.
Under the failures, the yellow triangles with an exclamation point inside indicate a warning. These triangles are called splats. They could indicate whether the software did not update properly or errored but did not fail completely.
The blue circles across the bottom are informational. They will inform you if software updates were successful or drivers were installed correctly.
In the lower‐left corner of the Reliability Monitor screen, click the Save Reliability History link to save this timeline as an XML file. This file can be exported and analyzed by other reporting applications.
Click the View All Problem Reports link in the lower‐right corner next to the Save Reliability History link. This will open a new page that includes all the problems this device has experienced and can be reported directly to Microsoft. When there is a solution, it will appear in Security And Maintenance.
USING RELI
Let's say you are a system administrator. Most system administrators install, upgrade, and monitor software and hardware for their organizations. You have a server in your datacenter that is periodically misbehaving. You attempt to troubleshoot the issue and cannot duplicate the problem that was reported to you. Instead, you get the infamous BSOD.
You will learn that the first thing you ask customers when they report a problem is, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” If you do unfortunately experience a BSOD, then your only option is to power down and turn the device back on. Check reli to determine what caused that crash.
It has been my experience that a BSOD is caused by bad drivers, overheating, or someone installing new software that is incompatible with either the hardware or the operating system. Using reli is how you figure out what really happened.
No one ever admits to downloading and playing Duke Nukem Forever.
PSR
Are you the one in your organization who is responsible for continuance or documentation? Do you have to train others how to do their job, or have you been asked to train someone to do yours? Do you ever have to troubleshoot an environmental problem on a system or give a presentation at the last minute?
Problem Steps Recorder (PSR) goes back to Windows 7 and Server 2008. PSR is a combination troubleshooting, assistance, screen capture, annotation tool that few IT professionals know about. You can use it to document your steps quickly with annotated screenshots and instructions. You can use it to troubleshoot an issue for a customer who is not as IT‐savvy as you. My favorite way to use it is to build documentation.
One of the best questions you can as your IT manager is, “What keeps you up at night?” When I am teaching, I try to learn as much as I can about my students' needs and goals. One of the biggest responses to the question about their security challenges is lack of documentation and continuance. This tool will help solve that problem.
In my experience, I have managed people new to IT who often ask the same questions over and over again. To empower them to find the answers, I created PSRs for repetitive questions like the following and store them on an easily searchable SharePoint site:
“How do I add a static IP?”
“How do I configure a network printer?”
“How do I add a user in Active Directory?”
In Lab 2.2, you'll use PSR.
LAB 2.2: PSR
To open Problem Steps Recorder, go to your Start menu and type in PSR. Press Enter. You will see a menu like Figure 2.2.
Figure 2.2: Steps Recorder menu
Click Start Record.
Open your Calculator application, and on your keyboard, type 9+9 and press Enter. You should get 18 as the answer. As you clicked the screen or typed on the keyboard, a small red bubble indicates that Problem Steps Recorder is taking a picture of the screen.
Click Stop Record and wait to review your recording.
To review the Problem Steps Recorder file you just created, in the upper‐left corner of the recording, you could click the New Recording button if this did not capture exactly the process you were looking for. If it is a file that you will want to use, click the Save button. When you save this file, it is saved in a .zipfile by default. If customers/employees are having an IT issue, they can easily email you this file with all the contents for you to examine the issue. When you open the .zip file, you'll notice the file type is MHTML. You can right‐click and open this file type with Word and edit it until it reads exactly as you want it to for your continuance or documentation.
