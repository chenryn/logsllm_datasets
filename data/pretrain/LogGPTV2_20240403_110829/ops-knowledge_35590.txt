User: It seems like my Eclipse PyDev does not recognize that Twisted is installed on my system. I can't make auto suggest working. Does anyone know how to solve it?
Assistant: go to preferences->Pydev->Interpreter - Python and hit the apply button. That will rescan your modules directory and add any missing modules.
That should fix any normal import errors. Some modules do some runtime magic that PyDev cant follow.
