### Problem Description
The Chrome developer tools network tab lets you right click an item and select
"open in new tab". When you do (as far as I can tell) nothing happens. Nothing
gets logged to the command line, and the expected `new-window` event is not
called.
### Proposed Solution
I would expect "open in new tab" to trigger the `new-window` event on the
`devToolsWebContents` (or possibly the `webContents` itself) for Electron
developers to handle like any other `new-window` event.
