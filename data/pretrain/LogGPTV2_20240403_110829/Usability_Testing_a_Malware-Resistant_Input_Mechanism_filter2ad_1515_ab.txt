### Methodology for User Study

This section details the methodology employed in our user study, which aimed to evaluate the usability of each Bumpy variant in benign scenarios, the security of each variant in attack scenarios, and the effectiveness of warnings in training users to handle attack scenarios. The following subsections provide a detailed account of our simulation setup (§4.1), participant recruitment (§4.2), experiment phases (§4.3), and the types of attacks used (§4.4).

#### 4.1 Simulation of User Interface Alternatives

Participants in our study were students enrolled in a university course not taught by any of the study's authors. To ensure that the study did not disrupt the course, we designed the simulation to be unobtrusive. This meant that we could not control the computers or browsers students used to access the course web page.

**Key Changes:**
- **Trusted Monitor (TM) Implementation:** Instead of a separate physical device, the TM was integrated into the course web page using the Google Web Toolkit. The TM appeared as a minimized window with only the title bar visible. When updated, it beeped and flashed to attract the user’s attention, similar to a real TM.
- **Data Collection:** The login web page was instrumented to log keystrokes, mouse clicks, and focus events. This data was stored in a MySQL database, enabling us to observe user activities, including mistakes and backspacing, which are crucial for measuring password leakage.

**Example Log Sequence:**
- A user logging in with the "Original" design might generate the following log records:
  - Focus on the password field
  - Keystroke "@"
  - Keystroke "@"
  - Mouse click to expand the TM
  - Blur event (password field loses focus)
  - Focus on the password field
  - Keystrokes "p", "a", "s", ..., "d"
  - Mouse click on the "log in" button
  - Blur event (password field loses focus)

**Logging Benefits:**
- **Detailed Activity Tracking:** Logs include user mistakes, such as typing and backspacing, which are critical for accurate measurements.
- **Timestamps:** Useful for ordering events, computing login durations, and determining when users have abandoned a session.

#### 4.2 Participant Enrollment

**Participant Demographics:**
- **Total Participants:** 85 students from COMP 380: Computers and Society at the University of North Carolina (UNC).
- **Majors Represented:** 28 different majors, with the largest representations in Economics (14%), Business Administration (11%), Psychology (8%), Management and Society (6%), Biology (6%), and Journalism and Mass Communication (6%).
- **Year of Study:** One freshman, one sophomore, 24 juniors, 58 seniors, and one graduate student.

**Recruitment Process:**
- **Presentations:** Conducted during the second week of class, covering the threats posed by malware, an explanation of the experiment, participants' rights, and a brief demonstration of Bumpy variants.
- **Motivation:** Students were incentivized with a cash award up to $150, based on their performance in protecting passwords and frequent logins.
- **Enrollment:** Students opted in or out after the presentation. Those who opted in completed a background questionnaire, and none withdrew after the experiment began.

#### 4.3 Experiment Phases

The experiment was conducted in four phases, each lasting a specific duration and following the same order for all participants.

**Phases:**
1. **Initial (In):** 15 days. No simulated attacks; automated instructions provided to guide users through the login process.
2. **Benign (Be):** 28 days. No simulated attacks; automated instructions disabled.
3. **Attack (At):** 26 days. Simulated attacks activated with a 50% probability. Automated instructions remained disabled.
4. **Attack-and-Warn (AW):** 38 days. Similar to the Attack phase, but with post-login warnings to educate users about their actions.

**Support Materials:**
- **Instructional Video and Help Pages:** Available throughout the experiment to explain how to log in and handle potential attacks.

**Logins per User:**
- Figure 2 shows the number of logins per user in each phase, with box plots indicating the first, second, and third quartiles, and whiskers covering points within 1.5 times the interquartile range.

**Exit Questionnaire:**
- Non-Control group participants were asked to complete an exit questionnaire before the end of the Attack-and-Warn phase to assess the helpfulness of the warning messages.

#### 4.4 Types of Attacks

**Simulated Attacks:**
- **Feigned-Fail (FF):** Malware interferes with Bumpy’s operation, preventing the TM from updating or recognizing the SAS.
- **Wrong-Dest (WD):** Displays the wrong destination on the TM, such as cs.duke.edu, to induce password entry.
- **SAS-Present (SP):** Provides a password entry field with the SAS already present, encouraging users to enter their password without re-entering the SAS.
- **Passive (Pa):** Any login not selected for an Active attack is considered subject to a passive attack, where password characters typed before the TM update are counted as leaked.

**Design Considerations:**
- **Natural and Subtle Attacks:** Designed to mimic typical software discontinuities, avoiding more aggressive or misleading instructions.
- **Destination Selection:** Chose cs.duke.edu for the Wrong-Dest attack to avoid confusion with phishing-style attacks.

### Results of User Study

The experiment phases allowed us to evaluate the usability, security, and training effectiveness of each Bumpy variant. Usability in benign scenarios, security in attack scenarios, and the effectiveness of warnings are discussed in §5.1, §5.2, and §5.3, respectively. The Control group (Co) is compared in §5.1 but not considered in §5.2–5.3, as it does not offer resilience to the tested attacks.
