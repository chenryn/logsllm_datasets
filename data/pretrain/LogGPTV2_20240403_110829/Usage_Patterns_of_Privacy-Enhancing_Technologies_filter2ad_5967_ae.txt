### 5.1 Anonymity and Trust in Online Shopping

To ensure a customer's trust, shops can implement anonymous shopping systems (see Section 5.1). In such cases, customers should review the shop's privacy policy (see Sections 5.17-5.19) to understand how their data is handled.

### 6.7 Geographical Positional Information

In various scenarios, an individual's geographical position or history of positions is considered private information. With the increasing use of information technology, there are multiple ways to track an individual's location. Examples include:

- **Reservations and Tickets:** Linked to credit cards or other ID tokens.
- **Mobile Phones:** Leave clear traces of their position.
- **Wireless LAN Connected Devices:** Traced through the access points they use.

To enhance privacy, users can employ methods such as:
- **SIM Cards:** Not linked to the user’s identity.
- **Altered Computer Addresses:** That can be changed by the user.

However, even with these measures, traffic patterns (e.g., numbers called, emails sent, sites visited) can often reveal the user's identity, even if the content is encrypted. Common encryption solutions, such as GSM mobile phone encryption for transmitted data and WEP for wireless networks, are already widely used to protect private data from unauthorized parties.

### 6.8 Health Care Services

Health-related information is generally classified as private and should only be shared between a patient and relevant health care staff. However, safe treatment relies on access to a complete set of medical records, which must be reliably linked to the individual. Current procedures and systems for handling clinical health information prioritize patient safety over privacy. Most patients waive their right to privacy when their health is at stake.

Sharing medical data with public and private medical institutions, research organizations, and pharmaceutical companies presents significant privacy challenges. The health care insurance sector is a critical area for the implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies, both as part of the enterprise architecture and as stand-alone solutions. Examples include:
- **Remodelling Public Databases:** Using data management tools (Section 5.2).
- **Common Privacy Policy:** For the health sector (Sections 5.17-5.19).
- **Alternative Identification Methods:** For patients (Sections 5.20-5.22).

### 7. Major PET Players

This chapter provides references to selected providers of privacy-enhancing products and services, structured according to the principles outlined in Chapter 4. The list is not exhaustive but includes typical examples.

Interest in privacy technologies peaked in the early years of this century, declined in 2003 and early 2004, and has been picking up again in late 2004 and 2005. Some listed players are no longer in business (marked with an asterisk *), but they are included due to their representative nature.

### 8. Relevant Groups Influencing Public Privacy Perception

In Denmark, like most European countries, public awareness of privacy issues is low. Several organizations work to inform the public about privacy matters and influence public opinion towards demanding e-services that respect citizens' privacy. These include:
- **European Commission:** Directorate General “Internal Market” (EU DG IM)
- **Article 29 Working Party:** At EU DG IM
- **Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**
- **National and Regional Data Protection Agencies**
- **E-Government Authorities:** Digital Task Force, Ministry of Science
- **Human Rights Organizations:** Danish Human Rights Institute
- **Privacy User Groups**
- **Internet-Based Forums on Privacy**
- **Private Institutions:** Researching and developing concepts
- **Research Community:** Universities, public institutions
- **Trade Associations:** Representing industry sectors
- **Commercial Institutions:** Banking, insurance, telecommunications
- **Private Companies:** Selling PETs and consulting services
- **Security Working Groups:** IFIP Tech Committee 11
- **User Groups on Sensitive Data:** Health data

### 9. Challenges and Problems

#### 9.1 Privacy in Legacy Applications

Most current Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are designed to address flaws in the original design of IT systems and information handling procedures. Adding PETs to legacy systems can lead to:
- **Reduced Efficiency:** Multiple criteria searches instead of unique keys.
- **Less Reliable Data:** Flaws in data consistency are less likely to be discovered.
- **Increased Vulnerability:** Limited cross-checking capabilities.

These issues imply that additional changes may be required to maintain the efficiency, reliability, and robustness of the system, which are generally not covered by PET suppliers and require detailed application knowledge.

#### 9.2 User-Controlled Privacy and User Rights

Classical PET tools (anonymizers, pseudonymizers) help users protect their true identity. However, using such tools with services that assume a true identity is presented can violate the service provider's business assumptions. This could result in the service provider being unable or unwilling to fulfill subsequent obligations, such as warranty claims.

#### 9.3 Exploiting Design Flaws

Some PET implementations exploit design flaws in existing applications to add a level of privacy, such as inserting fictive data into fields designed to hold unique identification. This approach can be problematic if the appropriate checks are omitted in the receiving system.
