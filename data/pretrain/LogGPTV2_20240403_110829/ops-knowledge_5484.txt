User: How to process multiple files at the same time in one command line?
Assistant: Wildcards can be used to process multiple files at the same time, for example: 1. Process all files ending with .txt: `command *.txt` 2. Process all files starting with numbers: `command [0-9]*` 3. Process all files in a directory: `command /path/to/directory/*` In addition, you can also use the pipe character to connect multiple commands, for example: `command1 file1 | command2 file2 | command3 file3` so that each The command will process the different files while passing the output to the next command for processing.
