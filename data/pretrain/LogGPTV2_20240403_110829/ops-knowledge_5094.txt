User: I'm trying to use pywn, a python library for using WordNet. I've played about with python a little under Windows, but am completely new at MacOS X stuff. I'm running under MacOS 10.5.8, so my default Python interpreter is 2.5.1
The pywn instructions say: "Put each of the .py files somewhere in your python search path."
Where is the python search path defined under the default python installation in MacOS X?
If I've put the pywn files in /Users/nick/programming/pywn, what is the best way of adding this to the search path?
Is this the best place to put the files?
Assistant: I think by default /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/ is part of your search path. This directory is usually used for third party libraries.
