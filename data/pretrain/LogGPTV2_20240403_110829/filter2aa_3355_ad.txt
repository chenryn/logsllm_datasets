properly run by a skilled operator, will allow 
the IC to be connected directly to any other 
radio channel operating at the scene or to 
anyone via a telephone line anywhere in the 
world without changing the channel on their 
portable (or preferably the aide's portable 
radio).  
A Unified Command Talk Group can be es-
tablished to allow the heads of all of the 
relevant responding agencies to monitor or 
communicate on the command channel.  
Separate Tactical Talk Groups can be des-
ignated for various sectors as indicated 
above, and the IC can reach any of these 
groups quickly.  
All that is necessary is to work out a system 
to alert the dispatcher to connect/disconnect 
the IC as requested, and to establish proto-
cols for creation of tactical groups on scene.  
By allowing direct connection to multiple 
agencies and sectors, the IC can be far 
more productive, and get messages to the 
various agencies as needed.  The system 
can aid in keeping the span of control within 
acceptable limits. 
Other responders can request a patch to the 
IC through the TRP-1000 operator, which is 
terminated upon completion of the ex-
change of information, or can be left perma-
nently connected. 
3.4 Nomenclature Issues 
Any time multiple jurisdictions are operating 
at the scene, the potential of having more 
than one unit using the same designation is 
present.  For example, more than one unit 
designated as Tactical Unit 1, Medic 5, etc., 
can have disastrous consequences.  
Several of the jurisdictions indicate these 
issues are addressed through statewide or 
regional agreements.  However, agencies 
that have not addressed this potential be-
yond their immediate mutual aid system 
must do so.  This issue should be ad-
dressed to assure the potential is minimized 
if only by requiring agency designation prior 
to unit number as a protocol for all mutual 
aid i.e., Jefferson County, Tactical Unit 1, or 
Medic 5. 
3.5 Storage Recommendations 
Consideration should be given to the issue 
of storing the TRP-1000 to minimize the po-
tential of a terrorism incident taking out pri-
mary and backup communications systems 
at one facility.  Jurisdictions with a single 
unit are advised not to locate the system at 
their main communications center, while 
those with multiple units should spread 
them out across the jurisdiction.  Considera-
tion should be given to using one or more 
units as part of a backup communications 
plan, and it is strongly recommended that 
the units be kept in their transportable con-
figuration in order to take full advantage of 
the versatility this provides. 
3.5.1 Disperse Storage to Minimize 
Vulnerability 
Since a jurisdiction's primary communica-
tion center may be a target for terrorist ac-
tivities, it is recommended that the TRP-
1000 not be stored in the same location.  If 
a jurisdiction is fortunate enough to have 
multiple units, it is recommended that they 
be distributed throughout the jurisdiction, or 
perhaps loaned to neighboring jurisdictions.  
An example of well-planned dispersion of 
units would be to place one unit in a mobile 
configuration at a backup communications 
and dispatch facility, another in a location 
on the other side of the jurisdiction, and re-
maining units loaned to neighboring jurisdic-
tions. 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 3-8 
3.5.2 Stored as Pre-Deployed 
Backup Communications 
Some jurisdictions have opted to use the 
TRP-1000 for backup communications in 
the event of a failure with their primary 
communications system.  Others have 
setup their TRP-1000 as a mobile backup 
communications system that can be de-
ployed at various locations within the juris-
diction that have been pre-identified as logi-
cal sites.  This may be especially practical 
when a utility or command vehicle configu-
ration is used for unit transport. 
One of the advantages of using the TRP-
1000 as part of a backup communications 
package is its ability to take old radios from 
a variety of manufacturers, using multiple 
frequencies, and combine them into a single 
system with perhaps two or three common 
channels.  In this way, if a jurisdiction using 
an 800 MHz radio system encounters a sys-
tem-wide failure they could switch to older 
400 MHz systems and still operate with their 
existing infrastructure.  
If the Fire Department still dispatches using 
audible tones or if its stations are still wired 
to receive those tones in addition to having 
been converted to a computer aided dis-
patch system, the TRP-1000 could carry 
those tones by simply connecting an en-
coder to the system. 
3.5.3 Installed in Vehicles, Rack-
Mounted For Optional Usages 
Regardless of how a jurisdiction chooses to 
integrate the TRP-1000 into its response 
plans, it is strongly recommended that the 
unit remain in its transportable configura-
tion.  In addition to the shock-resistant fea-
tures of the mounting configuration, the 
portable rack mounting allows for multiple 
rapid deployment options.  
The system can be removed from the shock 
mounting system for permanent deployment 
in a communications center.  However, 
"TRP" stands for "transportable.‚Äù  The ACU-
1000 is the "non-transportable" version de-
signed for permanent installation.  Most of 
the agencies that have installed their units 
into vehicles for deployment intentionally left 
the units in the portable cases and secured 
the cases to the vehicle.  This allows for 
rapid removal of the system for other de-
ployment options and takes advantage of 
the shock resistance the portable cases of-
fer.  
The TRP-1000 is designed as a mobile 
communications tool that can be moved to 
the location of an incident and setup to es-
tablish interoperable communications for the 
scene.  The unit is designed to use mobile 
radios (typically used in vehicles) with ge-
neric omni-directional antennas positioned 
nearby.  Depending on the size of the juris-
diction, terrain issues, and antenna place-
ment, it could be possible to provide inter-
operability between radio systems over a 
larger area without additional repeaters and 
antennas for each frequency on the system. 
To illustrate the intent behind the design of 
the TRP-1000, consider a hypothetical ju-
risdiction responsible for 50 square miles of 
suburban population.  This jurisdiction uses 
15 frequencies on an 800 MHz trunked ra-
dio system that accommodates their daily 
operations.  The Fire Department from a 
neighboring county is called in for mutual-
aid to a large warehouse fire involving haz-
ardous materials.  Typically, the mutual-aid 
contingent using a low-band system would 
only be able to communicate amongst 
themselves at the fire scene.  The TRP-
1000 would enable them to integrate seam-
lessly into the response by providing access 
to the 800 MHz communications Talk Group 
using their own low-band portables and mo-
bile repeaters.

4 TECHNICAL AND TACTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS 
4.1 800 MHz Misconceptions 
Many jurisdictions are under the impression 
that an 800 MHz radio communication sys-
tem solves interoperability problems, negat-
ing the need for an additional system.  800 
MHz systems can incorporate units from 
neighboring jurisdictions if both systems 
have been programmed for that capability 
and both are operating on the same brand 
of 800 MHz radios.  However, they have no 
capability to incorporate other agencies with 
other brands of 800 MHz radios, or radios 
on other frequency ranges.  
4.1.1 Limitations of 800 MHz Sys-
tems at Large Scenes 
While 800 MHz communication systems 
provide significant flexibility at emergency 
scenes, the system must be able to handle 
continuing dispatch requirements and other 
incidents simultaneously occurring within 
the jurisdiction.  While the portable radios 
have a large number of frequencies avail-
able, the system usually has a limited num-
ber of Talk Groups that can be created be-
fore the system is overloaded.  Many juris-
dictions are already encountering over-
loaded 800 MHz trunked systems on a 
regular basis.  The additional requirements 
of a major incident will likely result in inef-
fective communications within the existing 
system, and the inability of allowing com-
munications with other "non-800 MHz" 
agencies.  
4.1.2 Talk Groups 
The TRP-1000 system has the capability of 
creating additional Talk Groups on scene by 
allowing the 800 MHz portables used in a 
Talk-Around mode to be connected with 
other agencies radios.  The TRP-1000 has 
the capability of creating several simultane-
ous Talk Groups with any of the radios con-
nected to it, or connecting all of the radios 
together simultaneously. 
For example, putting all hazardous materi-
als teams from across the region on one 
talk group (regardless of different radio sys-
tems) provides a tremendous benefit and 
will greatly enhance the potential for a posi-
tive outcome.  A recommended practice is 
to create a Unified Command Talk Group 
with the heads of other responding agen-
cies.  The agency heads can access the 
Unified Command from their own command 
posts, or they can be patched into the 
command channel to monitor the incident 
via telephone. 
4.2 Antenna Configuration Op-
tions 
There are almost as many antenna configu-
ration options as there are jurisdictions.  
Agencies currently using the TRP-1000 in-
dicate antenna placement is not a problem 
and that frequency interference conflicts 
were usually simple to resolve.  
4.2.1 Mobile Mounting, Rooftop, 
Portable Towers 
Jurisdictions mounting the TRP-1000 in a 
mobile configuration have used a variety of 
antenna installations.  Some use the mag-
netic, full-range units; others installed fre-
quency specific antennae on a vehicle's 
rooftop (or on a ground plane attached to 
the rooftop).  
Others mount a portable crank-up tower or 
pneumatic mast to the mobile unit to get 
greater coverage and separation capability 
for the antennas.  One jurisdiction utilized 
the donation of a pneumatic mast from a 
media company that retired one of their mo-
bile satellite trucks. 
4.2.2 Temporary Magnetic Mount 
Antenna 
The TRP-1000 systems have been supplied 
to the jurisdictions with several full-range 
magnetic mount antennas that work rea-
sonably well for limited events.  The mag-
netic mount units provide extreme flexibility 
in that the antenna can be placed almost 
anywhere and the system is operational in 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 4-2 
minutes.  The full-range antennae also re-
duce the potential of connecting the incor-
rect antennae to a radio that could damage 
the transmitter.  Interference between radios 
is resolved by a slight adjustment of the an-
tenna placement. 
4.3 Fixed Facility Options 
Several of the jurisdictions have installed 
fixed antenna units to allow the system to 
be operated as a semi-permanent installa-
tion that can provide greater coverage area, 
directional capability, and usually resolve 
any interference issues.  In some cases, 
such as using the TRP-1000 as a backup 
repeater site, jurisdictions can install the 
needed antennae, provide a power supply, 
and bring the unit to the facility when 
needed.  Some jurisdictions have one unit 
at their communications center to allow in-
terconnection with other agencies (within 
range of the communications center) and to 
allow ease of initial training and refresher 
training for the operators.  
4.3.1 Planning Deployment Options 
Several of the extremely large jurisdictions 
have terrain problems that prevented a sin-
gle TRP-1000 unit from covering their entire 
response area.  By using maps of the juris-
diction, it may be possible to plan for cover-
age of the entire jurisdiction from a couple 
of strategically located sites. 
In other cases, mobile deployment is the 
preferred solution with antennae mounted 
on the roof of the vehicle.  Combinations of 
fixed facility installations, complemented 
with mobile units, are also possible.  Taking 
advantage of existing antenna towers to 
place additional antennae for the TRP-1000 
provides coverage of a large portion of the 
jurisdiction from a limited number of sites.  
New Vipernet technology from JPS Com-
munications, Inc., will also allow remote op-
eration of the TRP-1000 units from a central 
communications center.  
4.3.2 Helicopter Deployment 
A jurisdiction with extremely difficult terrain 
mounted the TRP-1000 in a helicopter for 
deployment over the incident scene to pro-
vide capability that could not be accom-
plished from a ground site.  Other agencies 
have minimal need for helicopter deploy-
ment and would not wish to go through the 
re-balancing and re-certification needed to 
deploy multiple additional antennas and 
equipment on a helicopter.  
4.4 Power Supplies 
The TRP-1000 can run off 110V (volt) or 
220V alternating current (AC) and 12V or 
24V DC.  Power supplies can range from 
vehicle batteries to portable generators or 
units can be plugged into a standard power 
jack in a nearby building. 
4.4.1 Uninterrupted Power Supplies 
When using an AC power supply, especially 
a generator, it is a good idea to consider 
placing one or more uninterrupted power 
supply (UPS) devices (depending on capac-
ity) between the AC source and the TRP-
1000.  This is a relatively low cost means of 
protecting the electronic components of the 
unit, as a UPS will supply a continuous and 
regulated supply of power. UPS units are 
short life batteries that are constantly 
charged by the connected AC power sup-
plies.  
The TRP-1000 would then plug into the 
UPS device and be powered by the batter-
ies.  In this way, the TPR-1000 can remain 
operating for several minutes after the pri-
mary power source fails, allowing for the 
proper notifications and shutdown proce-
dures to occur.  The UPS device also 
serves to filter the peaks coming from a 
generator system. This prevents service 
interruptions if the generator runs out of 
fuel, or if the power cable is accidentally 
disconnected. 
4.4.2 Generator Capacities 
Most of the portable systems use portable 
generators in the 5-kilowatt capacity range, 
or carry (trailored behind the unit) multiple 
5-kilowatt generators for a backup capabil-
ity, as shown in Figure 4-1.  Under most 
circumstances, this capacity is adequate.  
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 4-3 
However, in situations where all of the ra-
dios are "keyed" for simultaneous transmis-
sion, the generator circuit breaker may be 
tripped. 
System loads should be calculated and the 
power supply systems engineered to allow 
adequate capacity.  Adding heating or air 
conditioning units will likely place too high a 
burden on a portable generator system. 
Providing safe transportation and storage of 
backup fuel supplies and refueling of the 
generator units should be addressed where 
applicable. 
4.4.3 DC Power Operation 
While DC power is an option for using the 
TRP-1000 system, it requires bypassing the 
power supplies built into the system, along 
with considerable rewiring of the units, mak-
ing it difficult to quickly reconfigure the unit 
for other deployment.  Jurisdictions wishing 
to convert the system to DC operations 
should check to make sure the DC power 
supply (alternator) is adequate for running 
multiple radio systems simultaneously.
