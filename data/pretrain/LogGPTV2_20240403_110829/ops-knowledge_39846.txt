User:  Please analyze the method of viewing the system memory and CPU usage in the Linux environment, and give specific command operation steps.
Assistant: There are many ways to check the system memory and CPU usage in the Linux environment. Here are two commonly used methods: 1. Use the free command to check the system memory usage The free command can check the system memory usage, including total memory, used Information such as memory, free memory, cache and swap space. The steps are as follows: Open the terminal and enter the following command: ``` free -h ``` -h means to display the memory size in an easy-to-read format, and the unit is MB or GB. After executing the command, the terminal will display the usage of system memory. 2. Use the top command to check the CPU usage of the system. The top command can display the CPU usage of the system in real time, including information such as processes, CPU usage, and memory usage. The steps are as follows: Open the terminal and enter the following command: ``` top ``` Then, the terminal will display the real-time status and CPU usage of the current system process. In the top command interface, you can use the following shortcut keys: - P key: sort by CPU usage; - M key: sort by memory usage; - T key: sort by time; - q key: exit the top command. The above is how to check the system memory and CPU usage in the Linux environment.
