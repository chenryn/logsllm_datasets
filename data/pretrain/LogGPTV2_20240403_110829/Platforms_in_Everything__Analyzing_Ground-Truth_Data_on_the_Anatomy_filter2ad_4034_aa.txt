Abstract
This paper presents the ﬁrst empirical study based on ground-
truth data of a major Bullet-Proof Hosting (BPH) provider,
a company called MaxiDed. BPH allows miscreants to host
criminal activities in support of various cybercrime business
models such as phishing, botnets, DDoS, spam, and coun-
terfeit pharmaceutical websites. MaxiDed was legally taken
down by law enforcement and its backend servers were seized.
We analyze data extracted from its backend databases and
connect it to various external data sources to characterize
MaxiDed’s business model, supply chain, customers and ﬁ-
nances. We reason about what the “inside” view reveals
about potential chokepoints for disrupting BPH providers. We
demonstrate the BPH landscape to have further shifted from
agile resellers towards marketplace platforms with an over-
supply of resources originating from hundreds of legitimate
upstream hosting providers. We ﬁnd the BPH provider to have
few choke points in the supply chain amendable to interven-
tion, though proﬁt margins are very slim, so even a marginal
increase in operating costs might already have repercussions
that render the business unsustainable. The other intervention
option would be to take down the platform itself.
1 Introduction
“Bullet-proof” hosting (BPH) is a part of the hosting market
where its operators knowingly enable miscreants to serve abu-
sive content and actively assist in its persistence. BPH enables
criminals to host some of their most valuable resources, such
as botnet command-and-control (C&C) assets, exploit-kits,
phishing websites, drop sites, or even host child sexual abuse
material [1–5]. The name refers to the fact that BPH provides
“body armor” to protect miscreants against interventions and
takedown efforts by defenders and law enforcement.
Much of the prior work in this area has focused on how to
identify such malicious providers. Initially, BPH providers
served miscreants directly from their own networks, even
though this associated them with high levels of abuse. Famous
examples of such providers include McColo Corp. [6], the
Russian Business Network (RBN) [7], Troyak [3] and
Freedom Hosting [8]. This operational model enabled AS-
reputation based defenses, such as Fire [9], BGP Ranking [10]
and ASwatch [11]. These defenses would identify networks
with unusually high concentrations of abuse as evidence for
the complicity of the network owner, and thus of BPH.
AS-reputation defenses became largely ineffective when
a more “agile” form of BPH emerged. In this new form,
providers would rent and resell infrastructure from various
legitimate upstream providers, rather than operate their own
“monolithic” network. Concentrations of abuse were diluted
beyond detection thresholds by mixing it with the legitimate
trafﬁc from the ASes of the upstream providers.
In response, researchers developed a new detection ap-
proach, which searched for concentrations of abuse in sub-
allocated IP blocks of legitimate providers [4, 5]. This ap-
proach assumes that honest upstream providers update their
WHOIS records when they delegate a network block to re-
sellers. It also assumes that the BPH operator functions as a
reseller of the upstream providers.
A key limitation of this prior work is that it is based on
external measurements. This means that we have little in-
side knowledge of how BPH operations are actually run and
whether assumptions behind the most recent detection ap-
proaches are valid. A second, and related, limitation is the
lack of ground-truth data on the actions of the provider. There
are minor exceptions, but even those studies contain highly
sparse and partial ground-truth data [2, 5].
This paper presents the ﬁrst empirical study of BPH based
on comprehensive internal ground-truth data. The data per-
tains to a provider called MaxiDed, a signiﬁcant player in
the BPH market. It unearths a further, and previously un-
known, evolution in the provisioning of BPH, namely a shift
towards platforms. Rather than MaxiDed renting and reselling
upstream resources on its own, it offered a platform where
external merchants could offer, for a fee, servers of upstream
providers to MaxiDed customers, while explicitly indicating
what kinds of abuse were allowed. By operating as a plat-
form, MaxiDed externalizes to the merchants the cost and risk
of acquiring and abusing infrastructure from legitimate up-
stream providers. The merchants, in turn, externalize the risk
of customer acquisition, contact and payment handling to the
marketplace. This new BPH model is capable of evading the
state-of-the-art detection methods. Our analysis shows that

in most cases, there are no sub-allocations visible in WHOIS
that can be used to detect abuse concentrations, rendering the
most recent detection method [5] much less effective.
Before we can develop better detection and mitigation
strategies, we need an in-depth empirical understanding of
how this type of provider operates and what potential choke-
points it has. To this end, we analyze a unique dataset captured
during the takedown of MaxiDed by Dutch and Thai law en-
forcement agencies in May 2018 [12]. The conﬁscated data
includes over seven years of records (Jan 2011 – May 2018)
on server packages on offer, transactions with customers, pro-
visioned servers, customer tickets, pricing, and payment in-
struments. In addition to the conﬁscated systems, two men
were arrested: allegedly the owner and admin of MaxiDed.
The central question of this paper is: how can we character-
ize the anatomy and economics of an agile BPH provider and
what are its potential chokepoints for disruption? We ﬁrst de-
scribe how the supply chain is set up. Then, we characterize
and quantify the supply, demand, revenue, payment instru-
ments and proﬁts of the BPH services offered by MaxiDed.
All of this will be analyzed longitudinally over seven years.
We also explore what MaxiDed’s customers used servers for.
Our main contributions may be summarized as follows:
• We provide the ﬁrst detailed empirical study of the
anatomy and economics of an agile BPH provider based
on ground-truth data.
• We map the supply of BPH services and ﬁnd a highly
diversiﬁed ecosystem of 394 abused upstream providers.
• Contrary to conventional wisdom, we ﬁnd that the
provider’s BP services are not expensive and priced at a
40-54 % markup to technically similar non-BP offers.
• We quantify demand for BPH services and ﬁnd it result-
ing in a revenue of 3.4M USD over 7 years. We conclude
the market to be constrained by demand, not by supply,
i.e. demand for this type of agile BPH seems limited.
• We estimate proﬁts to amount to signiﬁcantly less than
280K USD over 7 years. This belies the conventional
wisdom of BPH being a very lucrative business.
• We ﬁnd disruptable pressure points to be limited. Pay-
ment instruments were sensitive to disruption, but a re-
cent shift to crypto-currencies limits this option. We
identiﬁed 2 merchants and a set of 15 abused upstream
hosting providers as pressure points though their iden-
tifcation would have been difﬁcult based on external
measurements. The only remaining viable options are
raising operational costs and taking down the provider’s
platform.
We should note that the “bullet-proof” metaphor seems
less suited for this new model of BPH provider that we study.
Commonly, BPH is understood to include two aspects: (i)
intentionally enabling abuse, and (ii) providing resilience
against takedowns. The BP metaphor directs attention to the
resilience. This new business model, however, primarily fo-
cuses on the agile enabling of abuse at low cost. MaxiDed and
its external merchants provide servers for abuse at close to the
market price for legitimate servers. Customers then prepay the
rent for these servers. This means that the risk of takedown, in
terms of a prepaid server being prematurely shut down by the
upstream provider, is borne by the customer. Most customers
manage this risk by opting for short lease times and treating
servers as disposable and cheaply replaceable resources. They
take care of the resilience of their services themselves, using
these disposable resources. Some forms of resilience – e.g.,
reinstalling an OS and moving ﬁles to a new server – are
provided by the BPH provider as a premium service for an
additional fee. The ’bullet-proof’ metaphor is less suitable for
this business model. A more ﬁtting alternative may be “agile
abuse enabler”. That being said, in this paper we retain the
existing term. The market of intentionally provisioning host-
ing services for criminals is still widely referred to as BPH
and we want to maintain the connection with prior work.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First,
we provide a high-level overview of MaxiDed ’s business (S.2).
We then discuss the ethical issues related to our study (S.3).
Next, we describe our datasets (S.4) and the integrity checks
we performed to ensure the validity of our analysis (S.5). We
then outline MaxiDed’s anatomy and business model (S.6).
Next, we turn to the substantive ﬁndings and analyze the
supply and demand around MaxiDed’s platform, with a spe-
ciﬁc focus on identifying choke points (S.7). We also ana-
lyze MaxiDed’s customer population (S.8). We then take a
look at longitudinal patterns in terms of use and abuse of BP
servers by customers (S.9). The ﬁnal part of the analysis is
on MaxiDed’s revenue, costs and proﬁts (S.10). We conclude
by locating our study within the related work(S.11) and by
discussing its implications for the problem of BPH (S.13).

2 Background
MaxiDed Ltd. was a hosting company legally registered in the
Commonwealth of Dominica, an island state in the West In-
dies that is also known for its offshore banking and payments
processing companies. MaxiDed’s operators publicly adver-
tised the fact that customers were allowed to conduct certain
abusive activities upon purchasing its hosting solutions. While
WHOIS information of the MaxiDed domain shows that it has
existed since 2008, web archive data suggest that initially it
was just a small hosting provider with no mention of allow-
ing illicit activities. It underwent a major transformation in
2011 towards becoming an agile BPH service. MaxiDed does
not have its own Autonomous System, nor does it have any
IP address ranges assigned to it by RIRs, according to our
analysis of WHOIS data at the time of its disruption. This im-
plies that IP addresses are provisioned to customer servers by
upstream providers, rather than by MaxiDed. This underlines

Table 1: MaxiDed in comparison with previously studied BPH by
Alrwais et al.[5] that appear to be still operational
MaxiDed’s agile nature, i.e., its reliance on reselling upstream
infrastructure. Table 1 compares MaxiDed with several pre-
viously studied agile BPH providers in terms of the quantity
and types of services they offered. It highlights that its scale
of operations is around two orders of magnitude larger. It
is reasonable to view the provider as a major player in this
market which others have similarly pointed to [13].
3 Ethics
Our data is similar in nature to that used in prior studies
of criminal backends [14–16]. It originates from legal law
enforcement procedures to seize infrastructure. Using such
data raises ethical issues. We operated in compliance with
and under the approval of our institution’s IRB. We discuss
further issues using the principles identiﬁed in the Menlo
Report [17].
(Respect for persons.) The data contains personally iden-
tiﬁable information (PII) on customers, merchants and em-
ployees. Access has been controlled and limited to authorized
personnel within the investigative team, and later granted to
several of the co-authors. Since ‘participation‘ in this study is
not voluntary and cannot be based on informed consent, we
took great care not to analyze PII on customers, because they
form the most vulnerable party involved and not all of them
may have used servers for illicit purposes. We only compiled
aggregate statistics. For merchants, we have masked identi-
ties using pseudonyms to prevent identiﬁability. We did not
analyze the data in terms of MaxiDed employee names.
(Beneﬁcence.) We believe that our analysis does not create
further harm. We did not purchase services from the provider
and thus did not contribute to any criminal revenue. The au-
thors and police investigators believe the beneﬁts of a better
understanding of BPH operations, most notably in terms of
better countermeasures, outweigh the potential cost of making
this kind of knowledge more widely known, as the model of
agile BPH itself is already well-documented in prior work.
(Justice.) The beneﬁts of the work are distributed to the
wider public, in terms of helping to reduce crime. It especially
helps to protect persons who are more vulnerable to being
victimized. We see no impact to persons from being included
in the study itself.
(Respect for law and public interest.) This study has
been conducted with the approval of, and in collaboration
with, the investigative team and public prosecutors. It is im-
portant to note, that while captured information may point to
certain illegal conduct, establishing legal proof of criminal
conduct is not the purpose of this study.
4 Data
From the servers seized during the takedown, the Dutch in-
vestigative team has been able to resurrect MaxiDed’s admin-
istrative backend (CRM and database). They have granted us
access to the data and corresponding source code. We ana-
lyzed the source code to ensure correct interpretation of the
stored data. We observed how various resurrected administra-
tive pages queried speciﬁc records to display information.
The revived single-instance Postgres database contains
longitudinal information on several key aspects of MaxiDed’s
operations. On the supply side, it includes data on what server
packages were on offer, which merchants were offering these
packages, and the internal and externally-advertised prices of
each package. On the demand side, there is customer contact
information, order placements, rented servers, server assigned
