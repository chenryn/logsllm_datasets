### Abstract

This paper presents the first empirical study based on ground-truth data from a major Bullet-Proof Hosting (BPH) provider, MaxiDed. BPH allows miscreants to host criminal activities such as phishing, botnets, DDoS attacks, spam, and counterfeit pharmaceutical websites. MaxiDed was legally taken down by law enforcement, and its backend servers were seized. We analyze data extracted from its backend databases and connect it to various external data sources to characterize MaxiDed’s business model, supply chain, customers, and finances. Our analysis reveals potential chokepoints for disrupting BPH providers. We demonstrate that the BPH landscape has shifted from agile resellers to marketplace platforms with an oversupply of resources from hundreds of legitimate upstream hosting providers. Despite having few choke points in the supply chain, the BPH provider operates with very slim profit margins, making even a marginal increase in operating costs potentially unsustainable. The other intervention option would be to take down the platform itself.

### 1. Introduction

"Bullet-proof" hosting (BPH) is a segment of the hosting market where operators knowingly enable miscreants to serve abusive content and actively assist in its persistence. BPH provides "body armor" to protect miscreants against interventions and takedown efforts by defenders and law enforcement. Prior work in this area has focused on identifying malicious providers. Initially, BPH providers served miscreants directly from their own networks, leading to high levels of abuse. Examples include McColo Corp., the Russian Business Network (RBN), Troyak, and Freedom Hosting. This operational model enabled AS-reputation-based defenses, which identified networks with unusually high concentrations of abuse.

However, these defenses became less effective when a more agile form of BPH emerged, where providers rented and reselled infrastructure from various legitimate upstream providers, diluting concentrations of abuse. Researchers then developed a new detection approach, searching for abuse in sub-allocated IP blocks of legitimate providers. A key limitation of this prior work is that it is based on external measurements, providing little insight into how BPH operations are actually run.

This paper presents the first empirical study of BPH based on comprehensive internal ground-truth data from MaxiDed, a significant player in the BPH market. Our analysis reveals a further evolution in BPH provisioning, shifting towards platforms. Instead of renting and reselling upstream resources, MaxiDed offered a platform where external merchants could offer servers of upstream providers to MaxiDed customers, while explicitly indicating what kinds of abuse were allowed. This new BPH model can evade state-of-the-art detection methods, as there are no visible sub-allocations in WHOIS records that can be used to detect abuse concentrations.

### 2. Background

MaxiDed Ltd. was a hosting company registered in the Commonwealth of Dominica, known for its offshore banking and payments processing. MaxiDed publicly advertised that customers could conduct certain abusive activities upon purchasing its hosting solutions. While the domain existed since 2008, it transformed into an agile BPH service in 2011. MaxiDed does not have its own Autonomous System or IP address ranges assigned by RIRs, implying that IP addresses are provisioned by upstream providers. Table 1 compares MaxiDed with previously studied agile BPH providers, highlighting its larger scale of operations.

### 3. Ethics

Our data originates from legal law enforcement procedures to seize infrastructure, raising ethical issues. We operated in compliance with and under the approval of our institution's IRB. We discuss further issues using the principles identified in the Menlo Report:

- **Respect for Persons:** The data contains personally identifiable information (PII) on customers, merchants, and employees. Access was controlled and limited to authorized personnel. We compiled only aggregate statistics and masked merchant identities using pseudonyms.
- **Beneficence:** Our analysis does not create further harm. We did not purchase services from the provider and believe the benefits of better understanding BPH operations outweigh the potential costs.
- **Justice:** The benefits of the work are distributed to the wider public, helping to reduce crime and protect vulnerable individuals.
- **Respect for Law and Public Interest:** This study was conducted with the approval of, and in collaboration with, the investigative team and public prosecutors.

### 4. Data

From the servers seized during the takedown, the Dutch investigative team resurrected MaxiDed’s administrative backend (CRM and database). We analyzed the source code to ensure correct interpretation of the stored data. The revived single-instance Postgres database contains longitudinal information on several key aspects of MaxiDed’s operations, including server packages, merchants, prices, customer contact information, order placements, and rented servers.
