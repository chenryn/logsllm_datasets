In 0.10.8, if I have a TypeScript Definition for a JavaScript file, there is
validation done on the parameters. This was particularly useful for finding
broken APIs.
Example of definition file and code:

In 0.10.8, a warning is shown for an incorrect type:

Now, in 0.10.10, there is no validation at all. The "100" shows as being
valid:

Losing the validation is a big loss. When switching to Salsa, was this the
intention? Is there any properties that can be set to have the JavaScript
intellisense + validation go back to the old engine (I believe it was using
the TypeScript engine).
Thanks
