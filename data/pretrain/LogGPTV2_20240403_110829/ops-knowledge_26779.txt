User: Is there a way to check to see if a pid corresponds to a valid process? I'm getting a pid from a different source other than from os.getpid() and I need to check to see if a process with that pid doesn't exist on the machine. 
I need it to be available in Unix and Windows. I'm also checking to see if the PID is NOT in use.
Assistant: I'd say use the PID for whatever purpose you're obtaining it and handle the errors gracefully. Otherwise, it's a classic race (the PID may be valid when you check it's valid, but go away an instant later)
