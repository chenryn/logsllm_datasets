Interviewees recognized that the response to a ran-
somware attack is difﬁcult because it includes ethical,
moral, and pragmatic considerations. In the end, how-
ever, interviewees displayed distrusted the attackers and
supported the university’s decision not to pay the ransom.
8 Discussion
8.1 The unaccounted costs of attacks
Estimates of the ﬁnancial and productivity costs to orga-
nizations as a result of ransomware are available in the
literature (e.g., [18, 38]). Beyond these, we identiﬁed
other costs that may not receive as much attention but
that can be equally damaging.
Emotional toll: Users experience stress and anxiety,
and this may extend well beyond the immediate after-
math of an attack since it may take weeks (or longer) for
users to catch up, recreate lost data, or deal with the con-
sequences of the attack (e.g., delays in graduating due to
lost research data, missed publication deadlines impact-
ing promotion/tenure dossiers, increased workload as a
result of lost templates).
Disconnect from social supports: When incidents re-
sult in inaccessible communication channels, users may
feel isolated and disconnected from their social sup-
port network (thus increasing the emotional toll) exactly
when such support might be needed. This was particu-
larly apparent with students who rely on the university
infrastructure as their primary internet access point, but
also among staff unable to reach colleagues.
Indirect ﬁnancial costs: End-users may incur indi-
rect ﬁnancial costs, such as additional mobile data, costs
relating to working off-campus (e.g., overage charges
on home internet accounts), or purchasing additional re-
sources (e.g., a new backup drive). While relatively mi-
nor costs, they may impose hardship on those with ﬁxed
incomes such as students. There may also be ﬁnancial
consequences to missed opportunities (e.g., inability to
apply for a scholarship).
Increased security burden: End-users may be sub-
ject to new, tighter security measures. These measures
may impose additional longer-term productivity losses
beyond those directly associated with the incident if cer-
tain tasks become more complicated.
We highlight that many of these costs are a result of
the (necessary) security response to an attack. And while
some may be inevitable, they should be considered as
part of a comprehensive cyber-response plan, and mini-
mizing them is desirable.
8.2 Suggested User-Centric Strategies
Several lessons emerged from our research suggesting
how organizations should handle such incidents. There
are obviously other factors at play when determining a
cybersecurity response, and not all of these were lack-
ing in this particular incident, but we believe that these
insights could help devise a comprehensive plan.
Share the plan: An explicit cyber-response plan
should be shared with the broader community before
an incident happens. This should, at minimum, explain
what is expected of users during an incident, how infor-
mation will be conveyed and by whom, and a commu-
nication schedule. The communication channel should
not put users at increased risk. For example, users may
connect to the organization’s WI-FI if updates are com-
ing through organizational email accounts. We also sug-
gest having an explicit policy for what will happen in
response to an attack, along with explanations. For ex-
ample, ‘our organization will never pay ransoms because
doing so increases the likelihood that the organization is
targeted for further attacks.’ or ‘we will erase and re-
image infected devices because we cannot guarantee that
they are not otherwise compromised.’ This information
should be conveyed simply and clearly ahead of time so
that everyone understands what to expect.
Communication is key: This was by far the most re-
quested component. Communication during and after an
incident needs to be frequent, straightforward, and up-
front. Our end-users wanted regular updates ﬁve times
daily during an incident, twice per day for the next few
days, and once per week for the following weeks. They
also needed explicit closure to an event; they wanted to
hear from an ofﬁcial source that everything had been re-
solved.
(i.e., similar to how weather forecasts broad-
cast that ‘the weather warning has been lifted’). The
on-going communication should include speciﬁc advice
for end-users and describe any adjustments made as a
result of the incident (e.g., Can they access speciﬁc re-
sources? What should they do with their workstations
or personal computers/devices? Are certain deadlines
extended? How do they contact individuals if regular
communication is disrupted?). The communication may
need to be customized for different user groups. Decades
of literature on warnings and crisis communication for
other types of emergencies, such as natural disasters,
offer comprehensive strategies and assessments of best
practices (e.g., [25]; much of their approaches may be
transferable to cyber-attacks.
Give victims a voice: End-users most affected by the
incident wanted a voice in the recovery process. It will
likely be infeasible to meet every request, but organi-
zations should recognize that individuals were impacted
well beyond the impersonal lost of organizational data.

By-passing their involvement in the recovery process fur-
ther compounds the negative, long-lasting impact. As we
witnessed in our study, many victims simply wanted an
opportunity for a debrief. They wanted to discuss their
experience, be heard, and have their insight and sugges-
tions taken into account.
Practice user-centric security: A common response
to attacks is to tighten the security policy, increasing the
burden on end-users. We argue, however, that security
policies must be realistic and not place an undue bur-
den on users. Security policies that are too restrictive
(e.g., disabling access to commonly used services), cum-
bersome (e.g., making it more difﬁcult to accomplish
tasks), or that make unrealistic demands on users (e.g.,
frequent password changes) will be bypassed by users,
either intentionally so that they can accomplish their pri-
mary tasks [14,44] or accidentally by making errors. Re-
examining policies is reasonable but changes should be
carefully weighted against their human cost.
Offer user-centric training: Cybersecurity training
should be an on-going service. In a large organization,
training will need to be tailored to meet various needs.
Given our interviews, we suggest that one-on-one con-
sultations may even be advisable to address individual
concerns and help end-users set up their system in a way
that is both secure and meets their needs.
In general,
training material needs to explain the threats and how se-
curity strategies address these threats. Users are more
likely to comply if they understand how their actions
contribute to protecting their and the organization’s re-
sources [1]. Here also, the broader risk communication
literature may offer useful insight (e.g., [5, 32]).
Provide user-centric data storage:
Storage and
backup must be straightforward, usable, and offer the
needed functionality (e.g., ﬁle sharing and remote ac-
cess). Many users did not store (or infrequently stored)
data on the organization’s network drives where it could
have been restored relatively easily.
It may be tempt-
ing to dismiss this as ‘the user’s fault’; however, in many
cases users had legitimate reasons for their decisions: the
ofﬁcial storage options did not provide the functionality
they needed, the functionality was awkward/difﬁcult to
use, or users misinterpreted the ‘safest’ options.
8.3 Reﬁned Ransomware Process
Inspired by Ali’s Ransomware Process [3] for individu-
als, we extend description to organizations. Our reﬁned
Organizational Ransomware Process diagram is avail-
able in Figure 6. One important differentiating factor is
the potential loss of autonomy for individual end-users
who must rely on the organization to respond to the at-
tack. From our analysis, this may cause additional emo-
tional and productivity strain, as well as incur additional

‘unaccounted costs’ (see Section 8.1), regardless of the
eventual outcome of the incident.
8.4 Limitations and Future Work
The studies may have a self-selection bias since end-
users who were most impacted may have had the most
interest in participating. For this reason, generalizations
about the entire community should be made with caution.
We also relied on self-reporting; participants may have
misremembered, left out details, or selectively shared
with us. There were sufﬁcient commonalities across re-
ported experiences, however, that we believe that these
are reasonable accounts. While we do not wish that other
organizations fall victim to attack, it would be interesting
to explore whether our ﬁndings hold for other organiza-
tions, in similar or different domains.
9 Conclusion
We had the (un)fortunate opportunity to be present in the
immediate aftermath of a crypto-ransomware attack at a
large academic institution. We collected data from end-
users through surveys and interviews to understand the
impact and their experiences throughout the incident. We
identiﬁed the technological, productivity, and personal
and social impacts on users, including some typically
unaccounted costs that should be considered when de-
veloping cyber-response plans. Most participants recog-
nized that attacks happen, but they expressed an impor-
tant need for clear and timely communication within the
organization about the incident, and a need for a voice in
the recovery process. We additionally propose strategies
to help organizations better prepare for similar attacks.
Given the statistics about ransomware attacks on organi-
zations, it is prudent to assume that an attack is likely and
prepare accordingly. Our work demonstrates that both
advance planning and recovery efforts must address hu-
man factors because the effects may last well beyond the
technical recovery of resources and data.
