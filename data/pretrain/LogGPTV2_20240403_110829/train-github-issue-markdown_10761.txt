## Feature request
**What is the expected behavior?**  
I need some webpack internals to use a `Promise` **ponyfill** instead of the
global `Promise`.
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**  
I'm bundling a web app that runs on 3rd party websites and I **must not**
pollute their global namespace with polyfills.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**  
No idea, but I guess `Promise` is the only thing that needs a polyfill for
IE11.
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**  
yes
