Let’s say that a hacker desires to extract large amounts of 
intellectual property from a network. However, steganography and 
covert channels would take too long. Instead, the hacker desires to 
obtain the information as quickly as possible, without alerting the 
victims that the information was obtained. 
This paper describes a technique to do this, by using the skills 
employed by professional magicians and applying these techniques to 
hacking. 
Magicians have been deceiving people for hundreds1 2, or perhaps 
thousands3 of years. Hackers have, perhaps unknowingly, have applied 
the basic principles of deception. This paper will show how the 
techniques of Magic and Hacking are similar. The basic arsenal of 
psychological techniques used by magicians will be explained. 
Parallels in hacking will be given. 
In addition, these techniques can be combined to make hacking 
more deceptive. To demonstrate the application of this, A scenario 
will be explains where techniques of misdirection are used to succeed 
in extracting information without being detected.  
Several papers have been published on perception4, social 
engineering (scamming)5, and how it can fool people. This paper goes 
further than that, by explains deception that can fool incident 
response and forensics teams. 
There are interesting parallels between the best hackers, and the 
best magicians. Magicians have an economy based on ethical 
guidelines, and secrecy.  Creating new and practical techniques is 
valuable as it can be used to boost direct income (bookings) and

English textbook about conjuring, as it explains how trickery can be done to explain the feats of “witches”.

indirect income (marketing the information to others). Some 
magicians keep their best and most valuable material private. When 
secret techniques begin to become more public, magicians will often 
sell their better material to a select group of professionals. The older 
the material, and the more common, the less it is worth, and the more 
there are who use it. 
The same is true for hackers. If you have unique skills, and can 
hack into sites using your private collection of zero-days, you have a 
higher status in the eyes of your peers. A top-notch exploit, that works 
100% of the time, is worth more, perhaps up to $50,000. 6 
The more a secret is exposed, the less valuable it becomes. 
Companies like TippingPoint, and Google7 are providing financial 
incentives to hackers. And once a secret is exposed, and becomes 
public knowledge, (available to script kiddies), the value for these 
secrets is much less. Magic secrets, like zero days, are priced 
according to their secrecy and value. The more exposed something is, 
the less valuable a secret becomes. 
Also, the more secrets a magician knows, the more elite a magician 
is considered. Prestige is given to magicians who can fool other 
magicians, and to hackers who can penetrate systems others cannot. 
This is all based on secret knowledge.  
There are more similarities, such as a preference for dressing in 
black.  However, that’s not the primary purpose of this paper. 
Magicians have long used a specialized vocabulary to describe the 
workings of illusions. I should at first explain some of these terms, 
and describe the equivalent hacking term. 
First I will define some physical devices, which magicians call their 
“props.8” 
Magicians used physical devices, or props for many reasons. Many 
items are ordinary, and therefore don’t require special mention. 
However, some are not ordinary.

The equivalent to a hacker is a program or machine. Most items in 
a personal every day experience are exactly what they appear to be, 
Some are not. 
A “
” is a device that has a normal function and a secret 
function. It is either a normal item secretly modified, or else it is built 
to have a secret function. 
For instance, if I were to take a pencil and glue a small magnet to it, 
it is now “gaffed.”  
The equivalent hacker technique is to create something, like a web 
site, or a program, that has a hidden function. Any program with a 
hidden back door is gaffed. Typically this is done with using special 
words or commands, URL’s that response to special keywords, 
keystroke combinations, hidden mouse clicks, etc. When spamers 
direct users to web sites for pharmaceuticals, the URL of the default 
page may seem completely innocent, to convince the hosting services 
that the site is legitimate.   Some systems have been hacked so when 
special keystroke combinations, like the Sticky Keys sequence, are 
pressed, a special dialog box opens, allowing special priviledges. 
Web sites with malware installed are gaffed. Any program with a 
back door is gaffed. 
A “
” is a device that appears to be one object, but in reality is 
another object. If I were to take a metal tube and paint it to look like a 
pencil, it would be a fake, and not a gaff.  
In hacking terms, a Trojan horse is a fake.  A web site that appears 
to be another site (Man-in-The-Middle) is a fake. Social engineering and 
spam disguised as legitimate mail encourages people to visit a 
phishing site, which are usually a fake verision of the legitimate site. 
A “
” is a secret device that provides a useful but unseen 
function. Gimmicks are not normally seen.  Rootkits are gimmicks. 
Any hidden file, or file disguised as something else, is a gimmick. 
Magicians also use humans to create deception. 
9 Some older magic books use the term “feke.”

The stooge is a secret accomplice, a confederate, a shill, or in 
hacking terms, an inside threat, depending on how much trust you 
give them, and how well you know the stooge. A shill is someone 
unknown to the victim. At the other end of the trust spectrum is the 
Insider Threat. Usually the more trusted the Stooge is, the more 
effective is the illusion. In some cases, pretending to be the enemy of 
the illusionist can be very effective10. This “Enemy of my Enemy” ploy 
is a very effect way to gain the trust of someone, and the more one 
“hates” a hacker, the more trust they can get from someone else who 
“hates” a hacker or hacker group. 
Magicians can use people as stooges, without their knowledge. 
They help the hacking without realizing this. They may lie to them, or 
tell them something, so they help the magician unknowingly. 
Sometimes magicians call this person an unwitting stooge or 
accomplice 
Social Engineering creates unwitting accomplice. Books like 
Mitnick’s11 and Hagnagy12 cover this in detail.  
The Patsy, or Fall Guy 
The Patsy, or Fall Guy, is someone who people assume is responsible, or who takes the 
blame. 
There are other techniques of magicians, which might be 
considered psychology rather than physical. 
The most important psychology to a magician is the appearance of 
normalcy - that everything is as it appears to be, despite any secret 
preparation or modification.  
Harlan Tarbell emphasizes “Naturalness in Performing.”13 Dai 
Vernon, also known as the “Professor,” stressed that lack of 
naturalness as one of the reason magicians fail to deceive.  
10 Tarbell, Harlan, “Tarbell Course in Magic, Volume 2”, page 35. Louis Tannen, Publisher. Also described 
in Nelms, Henning, :Magic and Showmanship,”1969,  Dover Publishing. Page 3 tells the story, told of 
Frederich Tilden performing The Charlatan.

A perfect illusion would be perfectly natural and logical. However, 
no illusion is perfect. Therefore magicians have to use other 
techniques to hide the flaws in an illusion.  
Anything strange or unusual increases suspicion, and provides a 
clue to how an illusion works. They may not immediately understand 
the exact technique, but they often could figure out when it happened, 
and by understanding the result, they can often retrospectively 
comprehend the secret workings of a magic effect.  
In hacking terms, the perfect hack is one that is completely 
undetected, even when examines in detail by a forensics team. 
Misdirection is the focusing of attention away from something. 
Some consider it to be merely the focusing of eyes away from 
something that can be seen. But this is just one example of attention. 
Focusing the thought process away from the true techniques used to 
create an illusion is just as important. Some of the techniques below 
can be used to misdirect. However, misdirection deserves its own 
section, and will be discussed later.  
A “
” is a secret action or move.  Anything that appears to be 
one action, but has a secret action, is a sleight. A perfect sleight is 
completely undetectable.14 
The hacker equivalent is the exploit, such as a buffer overflow. It 
seems to be a normal library call, but the secret action is to launch a 
new program. Any file that appears to be another file type is a sleight. 
A simple example is a program called picture.jpg.exe. A Windows 
machine will often hide the extension, so the executable appears to be 
a picture. Obviously, some sleights are more detectable than others. 
The “
” is defined15 as “a false show, a pretense, an imitation, a 
simulation. It’s a movement that creates a false impression. For 
instance, one can “feign” to pick up an object and place it in the other 
hand, and in reality the object never moves. Ideally, there should be 
no difference between a feint and the real action.  
14 There is a legendary move called the Fizbin Drop, which is supposedly the Perfect Sleight. I personally 
have never seen it performed properly, and think it is just a myth or a joke.   See Electronic Grymoire #423, 
et al. Also see http://www.dennymagicsite.com/fizbin/index.html . 
15 Brown, E. “The Feints and Temps of Harry Riser”, Kaufman and Greenberg, 1996. This term was first 
introduced by Jean-Paul Robert-Houdin,

In hacking, one example is purposely looking like the computer is 
busy, when nothing is happening.  A more extreme example of a feint 
is to attack a machine for the purposes of misdirection, or to hide the 
true intention of an attacker. A brute force dictionary attack can be 
launched against a compromised server, creating the illusion that the 
attacker does not have access to the server.  
It could also be used to hide another function. For instance, a 
hacker can use a brute force attack to covertly send information using 
steganography, covert channels, etc. 
A “
” is speaking or acting falsely. One definition is “An 
attempt to deceive someone into believing that one can or will do 
something.” This is like a feint, but with extreme attitude. In other 
words, attention is drawn to the action. It is usually verbal or written. 
Magicians often do effects, called “sucker tricks”, that seems to have 
an obvious method. The magician will “bluff” the audience by acting 
as if one method is being used, and encourage the audience to believe 
they guessed the “real method.” The magician pretends to not 
understand this.  At the end, it is revealed that the obvious method is 
100% wrong, with a surprise ending. That is, the effect was 
accomplished by another method.  
Some hackers have taunted their victims. Hackers often bluff when 
bragging about their adventures to other hackers. It is also used to 
Bluffing is the primary deception tool for social engineers and poker 
players. A honeypot is a defensive bluff, as it pretends to be what it is 
not. 
“
” – While this term is widely used, several “moves” have 
been labeled as a subtlety, instead of a sleight16. To be precise, a 
subtlety is a move that performs no secret action, as the action is in 
plain sight. However, it creates a false impression. A subtlety is often 
illogical when considered closely. However, it escapes detection when
