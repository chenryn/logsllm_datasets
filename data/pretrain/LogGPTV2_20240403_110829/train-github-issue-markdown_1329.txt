### System info
  * Playwright Version: v1.33.0
  * Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04
  * Browser: Firefox
  * Other info:
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Link to the GitHub repository with the repro**
https://github.com/ppath/playwright-firefox-buggy-large-req-payload
**Steps**
  * npm install
  * npm run test
**Expected**
For each test, the route/request interception should occur. Therefore, the
message `REQUEST INTERCEPTED: http://localhost:3000/api/foo ` should
be printed three times:
      ✓  1 [firefox] › tests/request_interception.spec.ts:17:5 › should intercept POSTing of 10KB payload (1.7s)
    REQUEST INTERCEPTED: http://localhost:3000/api/foo POST
    [browser]: response payload size: 10260
      ✓  2 [firefox] › tests/request_interception.spec.ts:23:5 › should intercept POSTing of 10MB payload (1.4s)
    REQUEST INTERCEPTED: http://localhost:3000/api/foo POST
    [browser]: response payload size: 10485780
      ✓  3 [firefox] › tests/request_interception.spec.ts:29:5 › should intercept PUTing of 10MB payload (1.3s)
    REQUEST INTERCEPTED: http://localhost:3000/api/foo PUT
    [browser]: response payload size: 10485780
**Actual**
When the request payload becomes equal or larger than 1MB, the request
interception does not occur. Thus, the route handler is executed only once:
      ✓  1 [firefox] › tests/request_interception.spec.ts:17:5 › should intercept POSTing of 10KB payload (1.7s)
    REQUEST INTERCEPTED: http://localhost:3000/api/foo POST
    [browser]: response payload size: 10260
      ✓  2 [firefox] › tests/request_interception.spec.ts:23:5 › should intercept POSTing of 10MB payload (1.4s)
    [browser]: response payload size: 10485780
      ✓  3 [firefox] › tests/request_interception.spec.ts:29:5 › should intercept PUTing of 10MB payload (1.3s)
    [browser]: response payload size: 10485780
So in conclusion, as far as I understand, the problem appears when:
  * The request payload becomes >= 1MB (I've tested it with payload of size 1023KB and it worked fine).
  * Running the tests with Firefox.
