User: Write a Python script to extract all URL links from a text file.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script to extract all URL links from a text file: ```python import re # open a text file with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file: # read a file Content content = file.read() # Use regular expressions to find all URL links urls = re.findall('(http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9] |[$-_@.&+]|[!*\(\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+)', content ) # Print all URL links for url in urls: print(url) ``` In the above code, we use the findall function in Python's re module to find all URL links. We use regular expressions to describe the patterns of URL links, then extract them and print them. You need to replace 'filename.txt' in the code with the actual text filename in order to read the file content correctly.
