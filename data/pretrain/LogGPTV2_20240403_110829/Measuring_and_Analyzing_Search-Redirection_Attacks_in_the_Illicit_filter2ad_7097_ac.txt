For unpopular queries (< 100 global monthly searches),
13 health URIs appear. But for queries with more than
100 000 results, the number of results falls by more than
half to 6. For illicit pharmacies, the trends are opposite.
On less popular terms, the pharmacies appear less of-
ten (24 times on average). For the most popular terms,
by contrast, 54 URIs point directly to illicit pharmacies.
Taken together, these results suggest that the more so-
phisticated miscreants do a good job of targeting their
websites to high-impact results.
4 Empirical analysis of search-redirection
attacks
We now focus our attention on the structure and dynam-
ics of search-redirection attacks themselves. We present
evidence that certain types of websites are disproportion-
ately targeted for compromise, that a few such websites
appear most prominently in the search results, and that
the chains of redirections from source infections to phar-
macies betray a few clusters of concentrated criminality.
4.1 Concentration in search-redirection at-
tack sources
We identiﬁed 7 298 source websites from both data sets
that had been infected to take part in search-redirection
attacks – 4 652 websites in the primary 6-month data set
and 3 686 in the 10-week follow-up study. (1 130 sites
are present in both datasets.) We now deﬁne a measure
of the relative impact of these infected websites in order
to better understand how they are used by attackers.

Table 2: TLD breakdown of source infections.
The goal of the impact measure I is to distill the many
observations of an infected domain into a comparable
scalar value. Essentially, we add up the number of times
a domain appears, while compensating for the relative
ranking of the search results. Intuitively, when a domain
appears as the top result it is much more likely to be uti-
lized than if it appeared on page four of the results. The
heuristic we use normalizes the top result to 1, and dis-
counts the weighting by half as the position drops by 10.
This corresponds to regarding results appearing on page
one as twice as valuable as those on page two, which are
twice as valuable as those on page three, and so on.
Some infected domains appeared in the search results
much more frequently and in more prominent positions
than others. The domain with the greatest impact –
unm.edu – accounted for 2% of the total impact of all
infected domains. Figure 3 plots using a logarithmic x-
axis the ordered distribution of the impact measure I for
source domains. The top 1% of source domains account
for 32% of all impact, while the top 10% account for
81% of impact. This indicates that a small, concentrated
number of infected websites account for most of the most
visible redirections to online pharmacies.
We also examined how the prevalence and impact of
source infections varied according to top-level domain
(TLD). The top row in Table 2 shows the relative preva-
lence of different TLDs on the Internet [46]. The sec-
ond row shows the occurrence of infections by TLD.
The most affected TLD, with 55% of infected results,
is .com, followed by .org (16%), .edu (6%) and
.net(6%). These four TLDs account for 83% of all
infections, with the remaining 17% spread across 159
TLDs. We also observed 25 infected .gov websites and
0.10.55.050.0020406080100% infected source domains% total impact22 governmental websites from other countries.
One striking conclusion from comparing these ﬁgures
is how more ‘reputable’ domains, such as .com (55%
of infections vs. 45% of registrations), .org (16% vs.
4%) and .edu (6% vs. < 3%), are infected than others.
This is in contrast to other research, which has identiﬁed
country-speciﬁc TLDs as sources of greater risk [26].
Furthermore, some TLDs are used more frequently in
search-redirection attacks than others. While .edu do-
mains constitute only 6% of source infections, they ac-
count for 35% of aggregate impact through redirections
to pharmacy websites. Domains in .com, by contrast,
account for more than half of all source domains but 30%
of all impact. We next explore how infection durations
vary across domains, in part with respect to TLD.
4.2 Variation in source infection lifetimes
One natural question when measuring the dynamics of
attack and defense is how long infections persist. We de-
ﬁne the “lifetime” of a source infection as the number of
days between the ﬁrst and last appearance of the domain
in the search results while the domain is actively redi-
recting to pharmacies. Lifetime is a standard metric in
the empirical security literature, even if the precise def-
initions vary by the attacks under study. For example,
Moore and Clayton [27] observed that phishing websites
have a median lifetime of 20 hours, while Nazario and
Holz [32] found that domains used in fast-ﬂux botnets
have a mean lifetime of 18.5 days.
Calculating the lifetime of infected websites is not en-
tirely straightforward, however. First, because we are
tracking only the results of 218 search terms, we count
as “death” whenever an infected website disappears from
the results or stops redirecting, even if it remains in-
fected. This is because we consider the harm to be mini-
mized if the search engine detects manipulation and sup-
presses the infected results algorithmically. However, to
the extent that our search sample is incomplete, we may
be overly conservative in claiming a website is no longer
infected when it has only disappeared from our results.
The second subtlety in measuring lifetimes is that
many websites remain infected at the end our study, mak-
ing it impossible to observe when these infections are
remediated. Fortunately, this is a standard problem in
statistics and can be solved using survival analysis. Web-
sites that remain infected and in the search results at the
end of our study are said to be right-censored. 1 368 of
the 4 652 infected domains (29%) are right-censored.
The survival function S(t) measures the probability
that the infection’s lifetime is greater than time t. The
survival function is similar to a complementary cumu-
lative distribution function, except that the probabilities
must be estimated by taking censored data points into ac-
count. We use the standard Kaplan-Meier estimator [23]
to calculate the survival function for infection lifetimes,
as indicated by the solid black line in the graphs of Fig-
ure 4. The median lifetime of infected websites is 47
days; this can be seen in the graph by observing where
S(t) = 0.5. Also noteworthy is that at the maximum
time t = 192, S(t) = 0.160. Empirical survival estima-
tors such as Kaplan-Meier do not extrapolate the survival
distribution beyond the longest observed lifetime, which
is 192 days in our sample. What we can discern from the
data, nonetheless, is that 16% of infected domains were
in the search results throughout the sample period, from
April to October. Thus, we know that a signiﬁcant mi-
nority of websites have remained infected for at least six
months. Given how hard it is for webmasters to detect
compromise, we expect that many of these long-lived in-
fections have actually persisted far longer.
We next examine the characteristics of infected web-
sites that could lead to longer or shorter lifetimes. One
possible source of variation to consider is the TLD. Fig-
ure 4 (left) also includes survival function estimates for
each of the four major TLDs, plus all others. Survival
functions to the right of the primary black survival graph
(e.g., .edu) have consistently longer lifetimes, while
plots to the left (e.g., other and .net) have consistently
shorter lifetimes. Infections on .com and .org appear
slightly longer than average, but fall within the 95% con-
ﬁdence interval of the overall survival function.
The median infection duration of .edu websites is
113 days, with 33% of .edu domains remaining in-
fected throughout the 192-day sample period. By con-
trast, the less popular TLDs taken together have a median
lifetime of just 28 days.
Another factor beyond TLD is also likely at play: the
relative reputation of domains. Web domains with higher
PageRank are naturally more likely to appear at the top
of search results, and so are more likely to persist in the
results. Indeed, we observe this in Figure 4 (center). In-
fected websites with PageRank 7 or higher have a me-
dian lifetime of 153 days, compared to just 17 days for
infections on websites with PageRank 0.
One might expect that .edu domains would tend to
have higher PageRanks, and so it is natural to wonder
whether these graphs indicate the same effect, or two dis-
tinct effects. To disentangle the effects of different web-
site characteristics on lifetime, we use a Cox proportional
hazard model [10] of the form:
h(t) = exp(α + PageRankx1 + TLDx2)
Note that the dependent variable included in the Cox
model is the hazard function h(t). The hazard function
h(t) expresses the instantaneous risk of death at time t.
Cox proportional hazard models are used on survival data
in preference to standard regression models, but the aim

is the same as for regression: to measure the effect of dif-
ferent independent factors (in our case, TLD and PageR-
ank) on a dependent variable (in our case, infection life-
time). PageRank is included as a numerical variable val-
ued from 0 to 9, while TLD is encoded as a ﬁve-part
categorical variable using deviation coding. (Deviation
coding is used to measure each categories’ deviation in
lifetime from the overall mean value, rather than devia-
tions across categories.) The results are presented in the
table in Figure 4. PageRank is signiﬁcantly correlated
with lifetimes – lower PageRank matches shorter life-
times while higher PageRank is associated with longer
lifetimes. Separately, .edu domains are correlated with
longer lifetimes and other TLDs to shorter lifetimes.
Coefﬁcients in Cox models cannot be interpreted quite
as easily as in standard linear regression; exponents
(column 3 in the table) offer the clearest interpretation.
exp(PageRank) = 0.92 indicates that each one-point in-
crease in the site’s PageRank decreases the hazard rate
by 8%. Decreases in the hazard leads to longer lifetimes.
Meanwhile, exp(.edu) = 0.77 indicates that the pres-
ence of a .edu domain, holding the PageRank constant,
decreases the hazard rate by 23%. In contrast, the pres-
ence of any TLD besides .com, .edu, .net and .org
increases the hazard rate by 40%.
Therefore, we can conclude from the model that both
PageRank and TLD matter. Even lower-ranked univer-
sity websites and high-rank non-university websites are
being effectively targeted by attackers redirected trafﬁc
to pharmacy websites.
4.3 Characterizing the online pharmacy
network
We now extend consideration beyond the websites di-
rectly appearing in search results to the intermediate and
destination websites where trafﬁc is driven in search-
redirection attacks. We use the data to identify connec-
tions between a priori unrelated online pharmacies.
We construct a directed graph G = (V, E) as fol-
lows. We gather all URIs in our database that are
part of a redirection chain (source infection, redirec-
tor, online pharmacy) and assign each second-level do-
main to a node v ∈ V . We then create edges between
nodes whenever domains redirect to each other. Sup-
