service was developed” in response to problems such as the
standards and protocols that “have hindered the uptake of
CBSE”, since they are “complex and difficult to understand”.
Therefore, if components are services, the reuse or integration
of processes will be eased, since we do not need to have
concerns, or constraints, regarding the connection of different
components using different technologies (e.g., .NET and
J2EE).
In light of the above, and since we need a definition of
