Question: A security consultant argues that implementing preventive controls such as application whitelisting and user access controls would effectively mitigate the risk of adversaries collecting data from network shared drives. What is the most accurate counterargument to this claim?
"A": "While useful, preventive controls cannot easily mitigate this risk since adversaries exploit legitimate system features to perform the collection.",
"B": "Application whitelisting and user access controls will prevent any form of data collection, making them the most effective solution.",
"C": "Network shared drives are inherently secure, and therefore, additional preventive controls are not necessary.",
"D": "Adversaries do not target network shared drives, so focusing on preventive controls is an inefficient use of resources."
Answer: A
