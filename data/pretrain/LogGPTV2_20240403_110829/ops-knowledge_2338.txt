User: I have installed libffi on my Linux server as well as correctly set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the correct directory, as pip recognizes that it is installed; however, when trying to install pyOpenSSL, pip states that it cannot find file 'ffi.h'. I know both thatffi.h exists as well as its directory, so how do I go about closing this gap between ffi.h and pip?
Assistant: To add to mhawke's answer, usually the Debian/Ubuntu based systems are "-dev" rather than "-devel" for RPM based systems
So, for Ubuntu it will be apt-get install libffi libffi-dev
RHEL, CentOS, Fedora (up to v22) yum install libffi libffi-devel
Fedora 23+ dnf install libffi libffi-devel
OSX/MacOS (assuming homebrew is installed) brew install libffi
