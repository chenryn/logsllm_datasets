User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Mail not relaying in postfix I am managing a server which mainly deals in relaying mail using virtual alias maps. For some reason unknown to me email that goes through these maps are getting bounced. I've checked to make sure the domains are in my virtual_alias_domains table but they are still bouncing. I've consulted the postfix site but everything seems to be set correctly. How can I diagnose this issue?

Below is information that might be of help:

Assistant: So wait. Get your wording right.

When you have virtual_alias_maps then this is to deliver mails to local mailboxes and not for relaying mails for others.

When you want to relay mails for other domains you need something like transport_maps or relay_domains and relay_recipient_maps.

See http://www.postfix.org/STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README.html for examples.

How do your logs look like when mails bounce?
