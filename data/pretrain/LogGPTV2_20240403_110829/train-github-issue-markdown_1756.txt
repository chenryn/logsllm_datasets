I have a simple application where the following scenerio:
  * LoginController extends SimpleFormController
  * LoginValidator implements Validator
Within LoginController I override the following method:
protected ModelAndView onSubmit(HttpServletRequest request,  
HttpServletResponse response,  
Object command,  
BindException errors)  
throws Exception
* * *
on proper validation with no errors, I would expect the app to call the
"onSubmit" method with the defined signature but it does not. If on the other
hand I override, the following method:
protected ModelAndView onSubmit(Object command)  
throws Exception
* * *
it calls the "onSubmit" method properly but I need to access the request scope
to set a variable in the session.
Why does it not work when I implement the
onSubmit(request,response,command,errors)? I have tried both Spring - 1.1.3
and 1.1.4 JARs.
PS: There is only one onSubmit method in the class. I have verified to make
sure there were nother onSubmit methods...
Thanks
