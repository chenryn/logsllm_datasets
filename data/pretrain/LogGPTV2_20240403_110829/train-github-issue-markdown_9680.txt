`unique()` and `type()` functions are not available in the nodes from
`graph.nodes()` of `jit.trace`. I used to fetch those before some upgrade I
made recently. As @apaszke suggested, It should be present in the internal
data structure but the new upgrade just removed it from python scope
    for val in trace.graph().nodes():
        print(val.unique())  # doesn't have unique
        for input_node in val.inputs():
            print(input_node.unique())  # has unique
