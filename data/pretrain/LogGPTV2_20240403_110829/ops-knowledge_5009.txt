User: I am running python 2.7, I can run a program fine when I open the *.py file.
But when I go to cmd and type "python *.py any other args", it doesn't work, it says that python is not recognised. This is hard because I am trying to do things like sys.argv[], any help is great.
Thanks
Assistant: I hope, your problem really was the problem I think it is, because I (hopefully) had the same. I'm very sure, Levon's answer was right, so this is the n00b solution. 
For the CMD to recognize "python", you need to add something to the environment variable "Path". When you're done with the insturctions you can type "echo %PATH%" into the cmd and it should show you the variable value you just changed.  

Go to Computer > System Properties > Advanced Settings > Environment Variables
Click the variable "Path" and add ;C:\Python27 to the variable value. Don't forget the ";" to separate the values.
Confirm with OK in both windows and you're done.
