**User:**
I am using Python 2.7, and I can run a program without issues when I open the `.py` file directly. However, when I try to run it from the command line by typing `python *.py [any other args]`, I get an error saying that "python" is not recognized. This is problematic because I need to use `sys.argv[]` for my program. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

It sounds like you might be experiencing a common issue related to the environment variable `PATH`. To resolve this, you need to add the path to your Python installation to the `PATH` environment variable. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Open System Properties:**
   - Right-click on "Computer" (or "This PC" in newer versions of Windows) and select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
   - In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.

2. **Edit the PATH Variable:**
   - In the "Environment Variables" window, find the `Path` variable under the "System variables" section and select it.
   - Click the "Edit" button.
   - In the "Edit Environment Variable" window, add `;C:\Python27` to the end of the existing value. Make sure to include the semicolon (`;`) to separate the new entry from the existing ones.

3. **Confirm and Close:**
   - Click "OK" to close all the windows and apply the changes.

4. **Verify the Change:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type `echo %PATH%`.
   - The output should now include `C:\Python27`.

After following these steps, you should be able to run your Python scripts from the command line using the `python` command. If you still encounter issues, please ensure that Python is installed correctly and that the path you added is correct.
