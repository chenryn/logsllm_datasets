User: How to provide elastic scaling support for a cloud computing platform? Please give a practical example.
Assistant: The key to providing elastic scaling support for a cloud computing platform is to be able to dynamically monitor system loads and automatically increase or decrease computing resources to meet different types of loads. A practical case is Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, EC2). EC2 can automatically scale to meet the needs of the application, and provides two different mechanisms of automatic expansion and automatic reduction. The automatic expansion mechanism means that when the load increases, EC2 can automatically start new instances to handle more requests. This mechanism can control when to start a new instance by setting some rules, such as: CPU usage, network traffic and other indicators. EC2's auto-scaling mechanism ensures application availability and only adds additional resources to keep the system running well. The automatic reduction mechanism means that when the load decreases, EC2 can automatically stop some idle instances, so as to avoid consuming unnecessary computing resources. EC2's automatic scaling mechanism can greatly reduce operating costs and provide users with a more elastic computing experience. In general, EC2's elastic scaling support provides users with a highly available computing platform, which can intelligently adjust computing resources according to actual needs, so as to provide users with better services.
