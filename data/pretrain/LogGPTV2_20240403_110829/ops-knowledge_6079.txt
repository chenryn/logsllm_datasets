User: Please list common web attack methods, and how to prevent and detect them?
Assistant: Common web attack methods include: 1. SQL injection attack: By constructing malicious SQL statements, exploiting program vulnerabilities to obtain or tamper with data in the database. Prevention and detection methods: use precompiled statements or parameterized queries, filter input data, limit the commands that database users can execute, and use WAF and other technologies for defense. 2. XSS attack: The attacker exploits the vulnerability of the web application to inject malicious scripts into the web page, so that the page can be executed in the user's browser, thereby obtaining the user's information or performing other malicious operations. Prevention and detection methods: filter and escape the input data, set appropriate content security policies, and use technologies such as WAF for defense. 3. CSRF attack: The attacker uses the user's login status to execute malicious requests as the user, allowing the user to complete some operations without knowing it, such as changing the password and transferring funds. Prevention and detection methods: use two-factor authentication technology, verify the source of the request, and use technologies such as one-time tokens for defense. 4. File upload vulnerability: An attacker can gain control of a web application or directly execute malicious code by uploading a malicious file. Prevention and detection methods: limit and check the type, size, file name, path, etc. of uploaded files, scan uploaded files for viruses, limit the permissions of web application service processes, etc. 5. Command injection attack: Attackers take advantage of vulnerabilities in web applications to send malicious commands to the server, gain control of the server or perform other malicious operations. Prevention and detection methods: filter and escape the input data, limit the authority of command execution, and use WAF and other technologies for defense.
