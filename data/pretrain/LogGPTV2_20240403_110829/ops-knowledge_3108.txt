User: Please design a high-availability distributed system architecture, and consider disaster recovery, load balancing, data backup and recovery, etc.
Assistant: 1. Architecture diagram![image-20210805143001716](https://i.loli.net/2021/08/05/46Du3At7UGT2NPM.png) 2. System architecture description The high-availability distributed system architecture includes four main components : Load balancing layer, application layer, data storage layer and backup and recovery layer. (1) Load balancing layer: responsible for distributing requests from clients to multiple application service nodes, and adjusting the weight of request distribution according to the load of each node to achieve load balancing. (2) Application layer: including multiple application service nodes, each node is a server with an independent IP address, and has the same application code and functions. These nodes jointly provide business function services and share the load through the load balancing layer. (3) Data storage layer: including multiple database nodes, each node is an independent database server for storing and accessing business data. In order to ensure data reliability and high availability, it is recommended to use a distributed database or master-slave replication data architecture. (4) Backup and recovery layer: In order to better ensure system reliability and data integrity, backup and recovery are required. Backup and restore can be done on different servers, and a multi-layer backup strategy can be used to ensure that data is not lost. For example, you can set up scheduled backups and store the backup data on multi-tier storage devices in different locations. 3. System Implementation Description (1) The load balancing layer can use the open source load balancing software Nginx or Apache, which is lightweight, simple and easy to configure, and can meet the needs of most businesses. (2) The application layer uses a cloud server with good scalability, which has high performance and high scalability. (3) The data storage layer can use distributed database MySQL Cluster or MySQL in master-slave replication mode to ensure data reliability and high availability. (4) The backup and recovery layer can use various tools and technologies for backup and recovery, for example: - Database backup tools: such as mysqldump, xtrabackup, etc. - Storage backup: such as object storage OSS provided by Alibaba Cloud, OBS of Huawei Cloud, etc. 4. Key questions (1) How to synchronize data between multiple nodes? Data in the master database can be synchronized to the slave database through master-slave replication. The slave database is generally a read-only node for querying and backing up data. (2) How to deal with faulty nodes? A load balancer can be used for health checks. Once a node failure is found, it will be removed from the load balancer, and requests will be distributed to available nodes at the same time. After the faulty node recovers, it will be added to the load balancer again. (3) How to perform disaster recovery backup? Disaster recovery backup can be realized through multi-computer room deployment, using devices in different locations for backup, and using data synchronization tools to synchronize data to the backup node. In case of failure, it can be quickly switched to the backup node to ensure uninterrupted business.
