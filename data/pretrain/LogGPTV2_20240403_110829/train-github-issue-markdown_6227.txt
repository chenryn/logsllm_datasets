### What problem does this feature solve?
`v-model.lazy` on component is ignored and wasted, while `.number` and `.trim`
are effective.
### What does the proposed API look like?
    options: {
        model: {
            prop?: string,// = 'value'
            event?: string,// = 'input'
            lazyEvent?: string,// = 'change'
        }
    }
