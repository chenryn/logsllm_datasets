### Analysis of Unidentified Traffic

The significant increase in unidentified traffic warrants a more detailed comparison with other traffic classes. Given that P2P protocols often use non-standard port numbers, it is plausible that some of the unidentified traffic could be P20P traffic.

- **Unidentified Traffic:**
  - The distribution of unidentified traffic across different times of the day can provide further insights into its nature and potential sources.

This analysis highlights the need for a deeper investigation into the nature of unidentified traffic and its possible correlation with P2P protocols.
