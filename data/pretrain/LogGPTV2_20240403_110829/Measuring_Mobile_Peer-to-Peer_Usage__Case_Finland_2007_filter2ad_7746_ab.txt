The notable growth of unidentified traffic merits a further comparison with other 
traffic  classes.  Moreover,  as  P2P  protocols  are  among  the  protocols  typically  using 
non-default  port  numbers,  a  first  hypothesis  would  be  that  some  of  the  unidentified 
traffic would in fact be P2P traffic. The diurnal distribution of computer traffic by ap-
plication protocol for the measurement done in 2007 is presented in Fig. 3.
