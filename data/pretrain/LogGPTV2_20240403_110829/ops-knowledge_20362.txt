User: I have been asked to choose a project for my Operating System course at my university. I was bubbled with the idea of making an Operating System from scratch in Python. 
I have a few limitations: 

I have only 3 months. 
I want to do it in Python. 
I can put in say 20-30 hours every week into it. 

I want to know, how feasible is the idea? Like how far can I go in building the same. I would be very happy, if I can get a basic version running (something with a handful of very basic apps running.) Is it possible with the given limitations?
Is there a book that can help me like a guideline? (need not be for python, I just need a guide to tell me how I should go about making the OS)
If the idea is not feasible, can anyone tell me how much do I need to scale down my idea? 
Any help is much appreciated!
Assistant: In our university we have operating systems course where we too are supposed to develop something on linux. Not entire OS. We did our own scheduling policy and file system for linux. But this will be done in C since linux is in C.
