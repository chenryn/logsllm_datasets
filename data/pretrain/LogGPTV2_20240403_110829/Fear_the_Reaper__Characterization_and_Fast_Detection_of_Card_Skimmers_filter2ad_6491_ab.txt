payment card (e.g., an ATM, POS terminal, or gas pump) as a payment
device unless discussing a speciﬁc type of device.

battery. The attacker relies on time sequences to manu-
ally match PIN entry video to card data. We observed
that when law enforcement tries to determine if a pay-
ment device has a skimmer, they ﬁrst look for the cam-
era’s pinhole since it is faster for them to identify than
other mechanisms (e.g., deep-inserts, which we describe
below), further indicating that advice such as pulling the
card acceptor may not be effective. These cameras are
small enough that adversaries can hide them inside ATM
light ﬁxtures. Figure 5 shows such a pinhole camera. Ad-
versaries remove the light ﬁgures from ATMs, drill small
holes, mount the cameras behind the lights, and remount
the lights. Such a small hole is made more difﬁcult to
spot when a bright light shines near it; consumers cannot
reasonably be expected to ﬁnd these. We measured the
camera pinhole on a skimmer (shown later in Figure 13c)
at 1 mm. Accordingly, these devices are nearly impossi-
ble for consumers to visually detect, invalidating Tip 1.
Second, the adversary can deploy a PIN pad overlay
onto a point-of-sale terminal. These devices are placed
on top of the original PIN pad such that when the vic-
tim enters their PIN, each press is received by both the
overlay and the payment terminal. Such a device can be
seen in Figures 6 and 13g. Ultimately, these devices are
also difﬁcult to detect because they are custom ﬁt to the
attacked terminal.
Deep-Inserts are placed inside the magnetic stripe card
slot. These devices were constructed of a metal frame
custom ﬁt to the internals of the target machine. Figure 7
shows a deep insert skimmer recovered by the NYPD. To
install these, adversaries use a tool to push the skimmer
into the card slot and press it down. The skimmer sits in
a small empty space inside the card acceptor, which can
lead to a small amount of resistance between a victim’s
card and the skimmer as the card drags on the skimmer.
Like overlays, they contain an additional read head,
decoding and storage hardware, and a small battery for
performing an independent read of the card. They also
must be removed for recharging and data retrieval.
Wiretaps sit on the communication path (typically an
Ethernet cable) and perform a man-in-the-middle attack
on the transmitted card data. The fact that this attack
is effective implies that basic best practices for handling
sensitive data (e.g., SSL/TLS with working certiﬁcate
validation) are often not properly deployed.
EMV Shimmers are installed inside the EMV card slot
and intercept the communication path between the EMV
chip on the card and the payment terminal. Since the
EMV chip contains a nearly-complete replica of the mag-
netic stripe data, acquiring this data has some value to
the adversary. However, the chip does not contain the
CVV1 present on the stripe; instead, it provides a code
known as the iCVV. This prevents the adversary from
making a perfect counterfeit magnetic stripe card, though

ing internal access (Internal) and external access (Over-
lay, Deep-Insert, EMV Shimmer, and Wiretap).
the original, so the adversary has little room to add addi-
tional features or battery capacity. Figure 3 shows a typ-
ical overlay skimmer. While common advice is to tug on
these devices, our contacts inform us that the tape to hold
it on is often strong enough to resist pulling the device
straight off without a prying tool (such as a knife). This
prevents the skimmer from falling off or being easily re-
moved; these skimmers often cost hundreds or thousands
of dollars each, so the adversary is motivated to keep the
devices. Although Tip 2 may result in some success in
detecting skimmers, this remains unreliable, invalidating
Tip 2.
When the victim’s card is inserted, an independent
read of the card is performed, decoded, and stored. While
we initially expected these devices to have wireless data
retrieval capabilities, only 2 of the 16 devices had this
capability. Our partners informed us that because these
are battery powered and have limited space, the devices
must be retrieved every 2-3 days. Upon retrieval, the ad-
versaries will download any data and recharge the de-
vice before redeploying it. The two devices in the data
set with wireless data capabilities both targeted point-of-
sale terminals, where the device can be made physically
larger. However, the adversaries do not have the capabil-
ity to arbitrarily size their skimmers; the amount of space
available is dependent on the targeted payment device.
For adversaries to successfully skim an ATM card (the
most common attack in this dataset), they must also cap-
ture the victim’s PIN. There are two mechanisms to ac-
complish this:
First, the adversary can deploy a camera to record the
victim’s hand as the PIN is typed. Figure 4 shows a
frame of a real video from a skimming camera released
to us by police. These cameras are most frequently fully-
independent devices, containing their own storage and

the cards may be used where CVV validation is not per-
formed [33].
3.1.2 Internal-Access Skimmers
Internal skimmers are physical taps installed inside a
payment terminal. They intercept the communications
path between the card reader and other components. As
a result, this single device provides access to both card
data and any entered PIN.
This type of skimmer was found only inside gas
pumps. These devices tap power from the host device,
allowing permanent deployment with wireless data re-
trieval capabilities. As a result, all 5 of the recovered
internal skimmers contain Bluetooth hardware for ob-
taining the data. Since there is no outward appearance
of tampering, our contacts informed us that these often

capture cards for months before detection.
3.2 Targets
Banks and ATMs represented the majority of targeted
locations and devices. We initially believed that banks
would have sufﬁcient security measures to deter attack-
ers. However, upon discussion with law enforcement
ofﬁcers, we found that these are targeted because their
ATMs are often in the front where they can be accessed
when the branch is closed. Furthermore, they are likely
to offer attackers some privacy during off-peak times.
Branch ATMs are kept behind locked doors when the
branch is closed, allowing customers to swipe their card
on the door for access to the ATMs. Door skimmers are
functionally identical to other overlay deep-insert skim-
mers. As a result, the door locks are not only ineffective
at restricting access from attackers, they are also a source
of card data. Attackers with both card data and a PIN can
recover large sums of cash in a short time. The ease of
this attack leads ATMs to be the most targeted device
with 74% of recovered skimmers.
Gas stations followed banks, which our contacts in-

formed us is due to poor security measures taken by these
locations. The access to the payment device internals is
protected by a simple lock. No alarm is triggered when
the pump is opened, so adversaries that operate quickly
and discreetly encounter no resistance to installing an in-
ternal skimmer inside the pump. Although it is often dif-
ﬁcult to know the exact date the skimmer was installed,
the NYPD told us that these skimmers can be in place
as long as 6 months without detection. Unlike the ma-
jority of external skimmers, we believe this problem is
caused solely by poor operational standards and could
be resolved with basic physical security practices.
Finally, restaurants, hotels, and other retail establish-
ments constitute the remaining 17 skimmers in the data
set. ATMs remained the primary targeted device, how-
ever in these locations overlay skimmers were preferred
over the deep-inserts seen at banks. The retail standalone
ATMs typically found in these locations are manufac-
tured by different vendors (e.g., Hyosung, Triton) than
those installed at banks (e.g., Diebold, NCR). We sus-
pect that the manufacturer and model may inﬂuence the
type of skimmer used, but our dataset does not contain
complete make and model data.
3.3 Data Retrieval and Bluetooth
Despite the prevalence of smartphone applications which
claim to detect skimmers via Bluetooth, only 7 of 35
(20%) of the skimmers recovered by NYPD had wire-
less data retrieval capability; all were internal. Three
BOLOs did not specify wired or wireless retrieval. No
other skimmer, including the deep-inserts and any ATM
skimmer, had this capability; they require the adversary
to remove and connect the device to download the data.
Accordingly, existing detection technologies that rely on
this feature cannot successfully detect the majority of
skimmers and Tip 3 is unlikely to protect users against
most skimmers.
The majority of skimmers detected (71%) use serial,
SPI, or I2C communication to download the data. During
this time, the adversary can also recharge the device and
choose a new location for deployment. Due to the small
amount of physical space in most overlay and deep-insert
skimmers, batteries must be small and hardware is lim-
ited to essential features. All of the internal skimmers
discovered use wireless data retrieval, which is possible
since these devices can be physically large and tap power
from the host terminal.
3.4 Summary
The data from the NYPD Financial Crimes Task Force
shows that the majority of skimming attacks are against
ATMs and are performed using overlay and deep-insert
skimmers, with are difﬁcult to detect without expertise
and tools. Since these devices must be small enough to
ﬁt on or in the card acceptor’s slot, there is little room to
deploy features such as a Bluetooth module. Adhesives
used to afﬁx overlays are strong enough to resist being
pulled off, and deep-insert skimmers require special tools
to remove. As a result, common advice on how to detect
these devices is unlikely to produce a reliable result.
4 Designing a Skimmer Detector
With an understanding of the types and prevalence of
skimmers, we now focus our attention to the problem of
detecting skimmers. In this section, we state our hypoth-
esis, deﬁne the common properties of skimmers, and im-
plement the Skim Reaper, which uses these properties to
prove the hypothesis.
4.1 Hypothesis
The most prevalent types of skimmers seen in the NYPD
dataset are overlays and deep-inserts. These two types
of devices both add a second read head to the card slot,
such that when a card is legitimately read, an additional

“The most
ing/placing the magnetic read head is
ensuring that the magnetic read head is
always completely ﬂush against the mag-
netic stripe. This includes any curves or
bends in the card. If [the] magnetic read
head is not perfectly against the card at
any point of the swipe, you will have a
poor read.” [3]
Without touching the card, the signal from the mag-
netic read head is unable to be accurately decoded.
2. Surface Material: On every read head we have
observed, both in-person and via the NYPD dataset,
the read head appeared to be metallic in (at least)
those parts that are intended to be aligned with the
card’s data tracks. For the read head to function
at the most fundamental level, the head must be a
conductor. In order for the magnetic stripe card to
induce an eddy current in the read head, the volt-
age induced must be signiﬁcant. Constructing the
track-aligned sections of the read head out of metal
provides a low resistance, thus maximizing the volt-
age induced by the magnetic stripe. Due to this, the
face of the read head must be a conductor.
We veriﬁed on 17 different heads that this material
is both metallic and electrically conductive.
3. Size: We observed a wide variety of sizes and
shapes of read heads. Due to the limited space in
overlay and deep-insert skimmers, adversaries pro-
duce and acquire smaller equipment. In the skim-
mers we observed, the smallest read head we en-
countered still contacted the card over a 1.5 mm
section of the head. We attempted to ﬁnd heads
that contact the card over a smaller distance through
skimmer sales channels, and found many heads that
are thinner (i.e., low proﬁle, 0.5 mm). These low-
proﬁle heads also make 1.5 mm of contact.
As a result, we believe that the smallest available
heads still make over 1 mm of contact, and that re-
ducing the size further is either cost prohibitive or
physically impossible while retaining accurate card
reading.
These three properties constitute fundamental aspects
of card reading; that is, we believe that adversaries seek-
ing to read cards reliably must adhere to designs which
meet these characteristics.
Implementation

We now discuss our prototype implementation of de-
tection mechanisms for the above properties, called the

read occurs by the skimmer. Using properties intrinsic
to magnetic stripe reading, these read heads can be inde-
pendently detected. The number of read heads detected
can then be used to identify skimming attacks.
4.2 Fundamental Properties of
Overlay and Deep-Insert Skimmers
Through examination of the NYPD’s data set and a va-
riety of magnetic stripe devices we acquired (e.g., dip-
and swipe-style readers and card encoders), we identiﬁed
three common characteristics of skimming technology:
1. Touch:
In order for data to be accurately read
from a magnetic stripe card, the magnetic read head
must make physical contact with the card. Mag-
netic read heads are inductors; a voltage is pro-
duced in the presence of a changing magnetic ﬁeld,
which produces a current through the read head (or
eddy current) [49]. This principle is outlined by
Maxwell-Faraday’s Law of Induction. From this
law, a greater change in magnetic ﬁeld intensity is
directly correlated to the voltage and current gener-
ated in the magnetic read head.
