User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx Reverse Proxy HTTP Interceptor Is it possible to mirror the HTTP Traffic to a separate server to perform independent process (no response needed) while at the same time serving the original requests? 

Preferably I would like to do it using built in directives from nginx. 
Something like this.

Assistant: It may be possible in Nginx with post_action (found using Google search). You could also consider using GOR to do this.

Some kind of log file processing could be simpler, either near realtime or batch.
