When tapping on an image (such as a hero image) that is positioned below the app bar, the hero animation immediately brings it to the top. This part of the animation is generally acceptable. However, when pressing the back button, there is a noticeable delay in the app bar reappearing at the top, which makes the overall animation appear janky and less smooth.
