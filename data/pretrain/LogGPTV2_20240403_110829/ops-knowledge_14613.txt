User: I am running into a strange issue, running adb shell sendevent x x x commands from commandline works fine, but when I use any of the following:
subprocess.Popen(['adb', 'shell', 'sendevent', 'x', 'x','x'])
subprocess.Popen('adb shell sendevent x x x', shell=True)
subprocess.call(['adb', 'shell', 'sendevent', 'x', 'x','x'])
They all fail - the simulated touch even that works in a shell script does not work properly when called through python. Furthermore I tried adb push the shell script to the device, and using adb shell /system/sh /sdcard/script.sh I was able to run it successfully, but when I try to run that commandline through python, the script fails.
What's even stranger, is that he script runs, but for example, it does not seem to execute the command sleep 1 half way through the script, echo commands work, sendevent commands don't seem to work.
Doesn't even seem possible, but there it is. How do I run a set of adb shell sendevent x x x commands through python?
Assistant: sendevent takes 4 parameters
args for Popen should be ['adb',
'shell', 'sendevent /dev/input/eventX type code value'] - do not split the remote command
timings are important for sendevent sequences and adb shell call itself is kind of expensive - so using shell script on the device works better
pay attention to the newline characters in your shell scripts - make sure it's unix style (single \n instead of the \r\n)
