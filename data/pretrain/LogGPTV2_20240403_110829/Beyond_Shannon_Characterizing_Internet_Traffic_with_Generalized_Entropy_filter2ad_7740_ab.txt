By a spectrum pattern we denote the consecutive cq’s for a representative set of
values of q. In particular, we compute the pattern for q = [−2,−0.5, 0, 0.5, 2]. For
instance, the pattern --0++ means that Sq is below threshold for q = [−2,−0.5],
above threshold for q = [0.5, 2] and in the normal range for q = 0. The following table

For each attack, incoming and outgoing trafﬁc is considered separately. Selected fea-
tures are src/dst addresses and ports as well as the AS numbers.2
The web servers used as reﬂectors in the reﬂ. DDoS attack appear in the incoming
DstIPs (requests from the real attackers). The number of reﬂectors (30,000) was large
enough to increase the area of the high activity domain, resulting in a positive alert for
q = 2. The relative activity of rare events was further reduced, amplifying their impact
in the low activity domain and resulting in another positive alert for q = −2. The victim,
being a single high activity host, had a contrary inﬂuence on the outgoing DstIPs and
AS. The relative activity of other hosts was reduced by the appearance of the new heavy
hitter and thus the overall area of the high activity domain was decreased. The reduction
in relative activity also occurred to the already rare hosts, again amplifying their impact
in the low activity domain. A similar effect is observed in the incoming DstPorts, where
a concentration on port 80 is induced by the attack. However, the incoming SrcPorts
where randomly distributed and activated virtually all ports. As a consequence, the for-
mer rare ports experienced a lift in activity and did not contribute to the low activity
domain anymore, leading to negative alerts for q < 0. Figure 2(d) nicely illustrates
the observed pattern (--0+0). Note that the patterns are symmetric with respect to the
diagonal. That is, changes in incoming SrcIP/SrcPort columns are reﬂected in outgo-
ing DstIP/DstPort columns and vice versa. This indicates that the reﬂectors actually
managed to reply to all requests (no egress ﬁlter was in place).
The main difference between the reﬂ. DDoS and the ordinary DDoS attacks is that
the former uses real hosts (the reﬂectors), whereas the latter uses massively spoofed
source IP addresses. For both attacks, the incoming SrcIP TES was affected over a
wide range (++++0), including the SrcIP count (q = 0). For the DDoS 2, however, the
alerts in outgoing DstIPs is missing because no response ﬂows were generated.
For both, the Blaster and the Witty worm, destination addresses of spreading attack
trafﬁc were generated randomly, much the same way as sources were spoofed during the
DDoS attacks. And in fact, the pattern exhibited by incoming worm DstIPs is exactly
the same as the pattern for incoming DDoS SrcIPs. The pattern produced by random
feature selection (++++0) is also visible in incoming DstPort for the Witty worm. On
the other hand, the pattern speciﬁc to feature concentration (++0--) is for instance
visible in incoming Witty SrcPort (ﬁxed to UDP 4000), incoming reﬂ. DDoS DstPort
(ﬁxed to TCP 80) or incoming DstIPs for DDoS 1 and 2.
Random feature selection can have a different impact on ports than on IP addresses.
Whereas incoming DstPort for Witty shows the typical pattern, the one for incoming
SrcPorts of the reﬂ. DDoS looks quite different (--0+0). Random selection of IP ad-
dresses leads to many addresses with very low activity because the range of potential
addresses is big. For ports, the range is limited to 65535 values. Thus, if intensive ran-
dom port scanning is performed, all ports are often revisited and become frequent, ba-
sically eliminating the low activity area. This is what happened in the reﬂ. DDoS case,
indeed. We conclude that for ports, the strength (volume) of the attack plays a crucial
role. For low volume attacks, the random port pattern looks like the random IP pattern,
however, increasing attack volume shifts the pattern toward --0+0.
2 Note that our trafﬁc is recorded at a single stub AS. Consequently, source AS are shown for
incoming and destination AS for outgoing trafﬁc, respectively.
Beyond Shannon: Characterizing Internet Trafﬁc
247
Summing up, we see that fundamental distribution changes such as concentration
or dispersion of features are well reﬂected by different TES patterns and can therefore
be used to infer underlying trafﬁc structure. In future work, we will consider the effect
of attack volume as well as additional patterns, e.g., the distribution of ﬂow sizes and
durations. The ﬁnal goal is to develop a comprehensive and diverse set of TES patterns,
suitable to accurately detect and classify network anomalies. For this, we need to do a
more in-depth evaluation to prove that the improved detection sensitivity does not come
along with a high ratio of false positives. Because our preliminary results suggest that
TES is very robust (e.g., 8 days without a false alarm in 2(c)) even when using our
trivial detection approach, we are positive that this will not be the case.
5 Related Work
Shannon entropy analysis has been applied successfully to the detection of fast Internet
worms [6] and anomaly detection in general [7,8]. A different application of entropy is
presented in [19], where the authors introduce an approach to detect anomalies based
on Maximum Entropy estimation and relative entropy. The distribution of benign trafﬁc
is estimated with respect to a set of packet classes and is used as the baseline for de-
tecting anomalies. In [9], Ziviani et al. propose to use Tsallis entropy for the detection
of network anomalies. By injecting DoS attacks into several trafﬁc traces they search
for the optimal q-value for detecting the injected attacks. However, our results suggest
that looking at a single time series for a speciﬁc value of q is not enough for reveal-
ing different types of anomalies. Furthermore, they do not look at negative values of
q for which the entropy is very sensitive to changes in the low-activity region of the
distribution. This might be linked to the fact that their evaluation is based on sampled
or even anonymized traces. Truncation of 11 bits in IP addresses (as applied to the
Abilene traces) might remove the formerly rare elements by aggregating them on the
subnet level. However, aggregation is not necessarily a bad thing. Our results show that
if multiple levels of aggregation such as IP addresses (ﬁne grained) or Autonomous
Systems (coarse grained) are used, aggregation turns out to be a powerful tool to reveal
and classify anomalies.
6 Conclusion
The characterization and visualization of changes in feature distributions involves the
analysis and storage of millions of data points. To overcome this constraint, we pro-
pose a new method called Trafﬁc Entropy Spectrum. Our evaluation shows that the
TES is very sensitive to changes that are small compared to the overall size of the ob-
served network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can capture changes introduced
by different types of anomalies using just a few Tsallis entropy values and ﬁnd that
our method does not require adaptation of its parameters even though the network and
the underlying trafﬁc feature distributions change signiﬁcantly. On the detection side,
we propose to use the information from the TES to derive patterns for different types
of anomalies. We present ideas how we could use them to automatically detect and
classify anomalies. In a next step, we plan to do a detailed analysis of the patterns of
248

different anomalies and cross-validate them with traces from various networks. This
will eventually enable us to develop a TES-based anomaly detection and classiﬁcation
engine.
