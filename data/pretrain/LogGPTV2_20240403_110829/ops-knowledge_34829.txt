User: How can I detect when a flash drive is plugged in? I'm using a bare Debian installation, without any GUI and want to be notified in my Python script when a new flash drive appears... I know that D-BUS distributes such information, but i dont want to use D-BUS. Is there a more bare access to that information? Shouldn't that be available under /proc or /sys? How can I "connect" to that source?

Assistant: When an USB device is plugged in syslog writes messages concerning this to  /var/log/messages. The "dmesg" command shows this log. You can check near the end of the log to see which channel the device was attached to, it is usually /dev/sd(letter)(number) depending on the partitions and number of serial disks plugged into the system.
