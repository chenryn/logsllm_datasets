development practices and are instructed on the use of 
vulnerability tooling so that developed software is 
secure.  
• Ensure that reused system components – whether  
developed internally or open source) are evaluated as 
part of a standard process for known vulnerabilities 
(Ref. SA-15).  
• Maintain a system component inventor to aid in the 
maintenance of the software product throughout its 
life cycle (Ref. CM-8).  
• Continuously monitor system components for 
vulnerabilities that arise, and ensure that appropriate 
processes are in place for expeditious remediation 
once a fix is available. Automate this process where 
possible (Ref. CA-7, RA-5).

APPENDIX D: C-SCRM TEMPLATES42 
1. C-SCRM STRATEGY AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
To address cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, enterprises develop a C-SCRM 
strategy. The C-SCRM strategy, accompanied by an implementation plan, is at the enterprise 
level (Level 1), though different mission and business areas (Level 2) may further tailor the C-
SCRM strategy to address specific mission and business needs, as outlined at the enterprise level. 
The C-SCRM strategy and implementation plan should anchor to the overarching enterprise risk 
management strategy and comply with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, and 
regulations. 
Typical components of the strategy and implementation plan, as outlined in the below template, 
include strategic approaches to reducing an enterprise’s supply chain risk exposure via 
enterprise-wide risk management requirements, ownership, risk tolerance, roles and 
responsibilities, and escalation criteria. Note that the strategy and implementation plan may be 
developed as a single document or split apart into multiple documents. In any case, these C-
SCRM outputs should be closely related in nature.  
1.1. C-SCRM Strategy and Implementation Plan Template 
1.1.1. Purpose 
Outline the enterprise’s high-level purpose for the strategy and implementation document, 
aligning that purpose with the enterprise’s mission, vision, and values. Describe where the 
strategy and implementation document reside relative to other C-SCRM documentation that must 
be maintained at various tiers. Provide clear direction around the enterprise’s C-SCRM 
priorities and its general approach for achieving those priorities. 
Sample Text  
The purpose of this strategy and implementation document is to provide a strategic roadmap for 
implementing effective C-SCRM capabilities, practices, processes, and tools within the 
enterprise in support of its vision, mission, and values.    
The strategic approach is organized around a set of objectives that span the scope of the 
enterprise’s mission and reflect a phased, achievable, strategic approach to ensuring the 
successful implementation and effectiveness of C-SCRM efforts across the enterprise. 
This strategy and implementation document discusses the necessary core functions, roles, 
responsibilities, and the approach that the enterprise will take to implement C-SCRM capabilities 
within the enterprise. As mission and business policies and system plans are developed and 
completed, they will be incorporated as attachments to this document. All three tiers of 
documentation should be periodically reviewed together to ensure cohesion and consistency. 
42 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity.

The focus of this strategy and implementation plan is intentionally targeted at establishing a core 
foundational capability. These baseline functions – such as defining policies, ownership, and 
dedicated resources – will ensure that the enterprise can expand and mature its C-SCRM 
capabilities over time. This plan also acknowledges and emphasizes the need to raise awareness 
among staff and ensure proper training in order to understand C-SCRM and grow the 
competencies necessary to be able to perform C-SCRM functions. 
This initial strategy and implementation plan also recognizes dependencies on industry-wide 
coordination efforts, processes, and decisions. As government and industry-wide direction, 
process guidance, and requirements are clarified and communicated, the enterprise will update 
and refine its strategy and operational implementation plans and actions.

1.1.3. Strategic Objectives 
Strategic objectives establish the foundation for determining enterprise-level C-SCRM controls 
and requirements. Each objective supports achievement of the enterprise’s stated purpose in 
pursuing sound C-SCRM practices and risk-reducing outcomes. Together, the objectives provide 
the enterprise with the essential elements needed to bring C-SCRM capabilities to life, and 
effectively pursue the enterprise’s purpose.

In aggregate, strategic objectives should address essential C-SCRM capabilities and enablers, 
such as: 
• Implementing a risk management hierarchy and risk management approach 
• Establishing an enterprise governance structure that integrates C-SCRM requirements 
and incorporates these requirements into enterprise policies 
• Defining a supplier risk assessment approach 
• Implementing a quality and reliability program that includes quality assurance and 
quality control processes and practices 
• Establishing explicit collaborative roles, structures, and processes for supply chain, 
cybersecurity, product security, and physical security (and other relevant) functions 
• Ensuring that adequate resources are dedicated and allocated to information security and 
C-SCRM to ensure the proper implementation of policy, guidance, and controls 
• Implementing a robust incident management program to successfully identify, respond to, 
and mitigate security incidents 
• Including critical suppliers in contingency planning, incident response, and disaster 
recovery planning and testing 
Sample Text 
Objective 1: Effectively manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain 
This objective addresses the primary intent of the enterprise’s pursuit of C-SCRM. 
Establishing and sustaining an enterprise-wide C-SCRM program will enable the 
enterprise’s risk owners to identify, assess, and mitigate supply chain risk to the 
enterprise’s assets, functions, and associated services. Implementing an initial capability 
that can sustain and grow in scope of focus, breadth, and depth of function will be done 
in phases and will incorporate holistic “people, process, and technology” needs to ensure 
that the enterprise is able to achieve desired C-SCRM goals in areas such as improving 
enterprise awareness, protection, and resilience. 
   Objective 2: Serve as a trusted source of supply for customers 
Addressing customer supply chain risks at scale and across the enterprise’s diverse 
portfolio demands a prioritization approach, structure, improved processes, and ongoing 
governance. C-SCRM practices and controls need to be tailored to address the distinct 
and varied supply chain threats and vulnerabilities that are applicable to the enterprise’s 
customers. This objective can be achieved by: 
• Strengthening vetting processes, C-SCRM requirements, and oversight of external 
providers and 
• Ensuring that customer needs are met in line with their cybersecurity risk appetite, 
tolerance, and environment.

   Objective 3: Position the enterprise as an industry leader in C-SCRM 
The enterprise is well-positioned to enable and drive forward improvements that address 
how cybersecurity risk is managed in supply chains across the industry. Therefore, the 
enterprise must use this position to advocate for communication, incentivization, and the 
education of industry players about the enterprise’s requirements and expectations related 
to addressing supply chain risk. 
1.1.4. Implementation Plan and Progress Tracking 
Outline the methodology and milestones by which the progress of the enterprise’s C-SCRM 
strategic objectives will be tracked. Though enterprise context heavily informs this process, 
enterprises should define prioritized time horizons to encourage the execution of tasks that are 
critical or foundational in nature. A common nomenclature for defining such time horizons is 
“crawl, walk, run” Regardless of the designated time horizon, the implementation of practical, 
prioritized plans is essential to building momentum in the establishment or enhancing C-SCRM 
capabilities. 
Once the implementation plan is baselined, an issue escalation process and feedback mechanism 
are included to drive change to the implementation plan and progress tracking. 
Sample Text 
[The enterprise’s] execution of its C-SCRM strategic objectives and the sustained operational 
effectiveness of underlying activities require a formal approach and commitment to progress 
tracking. [The enterprise] will track and assess implementation of its strategic objectives by 
defining subsidiary milestones and implementation dates in an implementation plan. Monitoring 
and reporting on elements of the implementation plan require shared responsibilities across 
multiple disciplines and a cross-enterprise, team-based approach. 
The following implementation plan will be continuously maintained by mission and business 
owners and reviewed by the senior leadership team as a part of regular oversight activities. Risks 
and issues that impact the implementation plan should be proactively raised to senior leadership 
team by mission and business owners or their team. The implementation plan may then be 
revised in accordance with the senior leadership’s discretion.
