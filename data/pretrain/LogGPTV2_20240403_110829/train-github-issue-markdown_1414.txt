  5. Close app and re-launch it from command prompt with disable-extension argument.

b. Linter is working as it was working before re-launch.  
c. Debugger is working as it was working before re-launch.  
d. Intellisense is working as it was working before re-launch.
Expected: There should not be any error message.
