### Title: Bypassing and Fixing Bluetooth-based Proximity Authentication

**Abstract:**

Bluetooth-enabled devices can indirectly verify the proximity of other connected devices, which can be leveraged as an authentication mechanism. Due to the widespread adoption of Bluetooth, major software vendors like Google and Microsoft have integrated this proximity-based authentication into their operating systems, including Android and Windows 10.

Google's Android supports a feature called Smart Lock, which allows users to register 'trusted' Bluetooth devices. When these trusted devices are within range, the user can bypass passcode entry. Conversely, Microsoft's Windows 10 includes Dynamic Lock, which automatically locks the device if a paired smartphone moves out of range, thereby preventing unauthorized access when the user is not present.

In this presentation, we will explore the security vulnerabilities associated with Bluetooth-based proximity authentication. We conducted a detailed analysis of both Android Smart Lock and Windows Dynamic Lock, and we identified new attacks that can bypass these mechanisms. Specifically, we discovered three novel attacks:

1. **Android Smart Lock Bypass:** Attackers can circumvent a security check designed to prevent MAC address spoofing.
2. **Windows Dynamic Lock Spoofing:** Attackers can alter the MAC address and device class to mimic a paired smartphone, and the system is also vulnerable to proximity spoofing attacks.

Our analysis revealed that these vulnerabilities stem from the acceptance of untrusted data from Bluetooth for authentication purposes. Additionally, both systems exhibit weaknesses in proximity checking: Android does not adequately verify device proximity, while Windows is susceptible to signal amplification attacks.

Finally, we will discuss potential countermeasures and inherent weaknesses in Bluetooth-based proximity checking. We will also provide guidance on how to analyze the security of Bluetooth-based device and proximity authentication methods. Our proposed countermeasures include strategies for accepting only trusted data from Bluetooth for authentication. Furthermore, we will release a detection tool to help identify and mitigate the issues we have uncovered.
