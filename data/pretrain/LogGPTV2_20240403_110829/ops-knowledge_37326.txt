User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Disable connection tracking with UFW for port 80 During load testing my server is dropping packets due to "connection tracking" way before it's running out of resources. I'm using Ubuntu Jaunty with ufw. In my syslog I get:

ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet.

I looked at upping the max connection table size, but I don't know of an advantage for tracking these connections on these ports. I would like to know how to use ufw to tell it not to track requests to port 80 and 443.

Clarifying


No natting needed, it's just a web
server.


Thank you.

Assistant: iptables -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j NOTRACK 
iptables -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j NOTRACK 


will disable connection tracking just for these ports.
