document types in todays real world scenarios. We believe that documents
with similar properties can be found in other scenarios as well.
In this scenario, a project report contains conﬁdential research results,
more precisely, the results from a current project. A project summary is
a summary of current projects. As a consequence, it contains conﬁdential
information, too. A patent application contains research result that are con-
sidered to be of high value. Therefore a patent application is top secret
and accessible for only a very small fraction of the employees. In contrast
to this, information in a press release is public and accessible for anyone.
Finally, an internal newsletter is addressed to all employees. This newslet-
ter contains internal information that is accessible for every employee of the
company. Nevertheless, this information should only be read by employees
of the company.

Table 3.2: Document types used in the scenario
The subjects of our scenario act in ﬁve diﬀerent roles (roles are described
in [SCFY96] and explained in Section 2.1.2), namely employee, researcher,
senior researcher, accountant and senior accountant. These roles are
organized in a hierarchy as depicted in Figure 3.1. In this example, employee
is the generic role for every employee of the company. A researcher is work-
ing in projects and performing research. A senior researcher is the super-
visor of one or more researchers. In similar fashion, a senior accountant is
the supervisor of one or more accountants, who execute administrative work.
Figure 3.1: Role hierarchy of the scenario
In the following, we present diﬀerent situations that illustrate challenges

for a history-based access control model. We believe that similar processes
and requirements can be found in many other scenarios, e.g., in health care,
public administration or academic research. The data transfers described in
situations 1, 2 and 3 are illustrated in Figure 3.2.
Situation 1: Text content of XML elements can be composed from diﬀerent
sources.
Let us assume that in our scenario a project leads to some promising results,
so that a press release is created (Step 1 in Figure 3.2) to announce the
success to the public. The press release carefully avoids to expose any trade
secrets. Shortly afterwards, a project report is written, too, consisting of
several sections including an introduction and a main section. Some parts of
the former press release are reused in the introduction of the project report
and some parts of the introduction are also written from scratch (Step 2). As
a consequence, the XML element carrying the introduction contains parts of
text from diﬀerent sources.
Figure 3.2: Data transfers of Situations 1, 2 and 3
Situation 2: Allow copying depending on source of copied elements.
Later, a company internal newsletter is published to inform all employees
about the new results. For that, some parts of the project report are reused
(Step 3), but only those which were extracted from the press release before,
because the other parts are considered to be conﬁdential and are therefore
not allowed to be copied.
Situation 3: Deny viewing depending on location of copied elements.
Additionally, the same public information, which originally came from the
press release, is also put in a company-wide project summary (Step 4), which
contains an overview of all current projects. Other projects reuse parts of
the project report as well and transfer copies of the conﬁdential parts to the
PreRelProRep 1IntroductionMainINProRep 2IntroMainPANew part1.2.3.4.5.ProSu6.34
CHAPTER 3. SCENARIO AND REQUIREMENTS
corresponding documents (Step 5). After that, parts of the project report
are copied to a patent application (Step 6). As a consequence, the protection
level of these parts must be raised to top secret, until the patent application
is granted. This also aﬀects copies of that part, which reside in other project
reports.
Situation 4: Deny viewing depending on previous content of a document.
Another situation arises when some top secret information is inserted into
an existing report. At the time the information is present in the report,
researchers are not allowed to view the entire report anymore. Later on, the
top secret information is deleted from the report. Even though that the top
secret information is now deleted, researchers are still not allowed to view
the report, because they could learn from the remaining document about the
very conﬁdential information.
Situation 5: Allow copying depending on the previous value of an attribute.
Moreover, some projects are funded by an external company, which is denoted
in the funded-by attribute of the corresponding reports. In our example, a
policy states that results of a project funded by “Company A” are not allowed
to be copied to projects funded by “Company B”. Even when A stops to fund
a certain project and the attribute funded by now reﬂects a diﬀerent funder,
it is still prohibited to copy the corresponding content to a project report
funded by B.
Situation 6: Allow operations depending on the subject that performed a
previous operation.
Additionally, a policy states that certain modiﬁcations of a document made
by a senior researcher cannot be changed by subjects in an inferior role, e.g.,
by a researcher. For example, a researcher can change the title of a section,
e.g., to make a suggestion, until the title is changed by a senior researcher,
who has the authority to declare the title as ﬁnal.
Situation 7: Allow operations depending on previous operations of the sub-
ject.
A diﬀerent situation arises, when the company of our scenario executes
projects for other companies that are competitors to each other.
In this
case, the access control system must ensure, that a researcher only gains
access to data of one of the competing companies. Otherwise a conﬂict of
interest could occur, because a researcher could misuse the knowledge gained
from the data of one companie. This problem is typical for the consulting
business, but in general it aﬀects all industries of the service sector, e.g.,
3.1. SCENARIO
35
the IT service industry. To enable restrictions that deny misuse of insider
knowledge, the access control system must be able to grant or deny access
depending on former accesses of a subject.
Situation 8: Default policies and exceptions from policies.
Another policy states that every employee is allowed to view company inter-
nal newsletter. Some parts of the internal newsletter can contain conﬁdential
information. Although these parts of the newsletter are not considered to be
top secret, they should not be viewed by speciﬁc groups of employees. For
example, some parts should not be visible for accountants, whereas other
parts should not be visible for researchers. Additionally, some of these re-
strictions may not apply for the corresponding senior position, e.g., a senior
accountant is allowed to view certain parts, which are denied for accoun-
tants. Alternatively to writing one newsletter and automatically censoring
some parts of it, the company could also create several versions newsletter
manually, which is clearly less eﬃcient and less comfortable.
There are several ways to deﬁne access control rules for situations like
the one sketched above. The most eﬃcient way to specify the corresponding
access control rules is to deﬁne default policies for the most common cases. In
this example, all employees are allowed to view the entire newsletter. After
this, each exception can be speciﬁed by an additional access control rule. For
example, a rule that denies viewing of some research related information for
accountants. As senior accountants are allowed to view some parts which
are not allowed to be viewed by accountant, another rule can specify this
exception.
The alternative to specifying both positive and negative rules, is to specify
only one kind of rules, e.g., only positive permissions. The drawback of this
approach is that rules get more complex. We illustrate the reasons for the
increased complexity in Figure 3.3.
Figure 3.3: Sets of objects with diﬀerent permissions
allxySets of objectsViewable for accountantsViewable for senior accountantsViewing allowedViewing not allowed36
CHAPTER 3. SCENARIO AND REQUIREMENTS
This ﬁgure illustrates three sets of objects where each set is depicted as
an oval. These sets are depicted for three situations. On the left side, we
show the sets in general. In all cases, the outmost oval represents all reports.
The oval labeled with “x” denotes the set of objects that accountants are
not allowed to view, whereas the oval labeled with “y” represents the set of
objects that senior accountants are allowed to view in addition to that what
accountants are allowed to view. In the middle, we show the viewable objects
of an accountant and on the right we show the viewable objects of a senior
accountant, where the viewable objects are indicated by the shaded area in
the ovals.
If we use positive and negative rules, each rules needs to specify a set of
objects corresponding to one of these ovals. In contrast to this, if we only have
positive or negative rules, the speciﬁcation of rules gets much more complex.
For example, the rule that deﬁnes the viewable objects for accountants must
specify a set of objects that corresponds to the subtraction of “x” from “all”.
The rule for senior accounts is even one step more complex.
3.2 Requirements
The previous situations have illustrated several challenges for an access con-
trol system. In the following, we extract requirements from these challenges
and deﬁne them individually. These situations were illustrated within our
example scenario. Concerning the requirements, we abstract from our ex-
ample scenario and deﬁne requirements that are useful for a wide range of
scenarios that share some properties with our scenario.
Requirement 1: Support of protection units smaller than XML elements.
We have illustrated in Situation 1 that XML elements can contain text frag-
ments, which diﬀer in the way how they were created. This can be very
important for security. For example, one part of an element can be created
from scratch, whereas the other part is copied from a top secret document.
Therefore, the access control system must keep track of these parts individ-
ually. Moreover, text fragments can diﬀer in the subject which has created
them. Consequently, we need a mechanism that keeps tracks of these parts.
Requirement 2: Set of operations to view and edit XML documents with
appropriate level of abstraction.
We need to deﬁne a set of operations that allows to view and edit XML
documents. There are many alternatives to design such a set of operations.
These alternatives diﬀer in the level of abstraction of the proposed oper-
3.2. REQUIREMENTS
37
ations. The simplest set of operations is a set consisting of a read and a
write operation. The level of abstraction of this set is too low to capture the
semantics of the operations in a way that is suﬃcient for our needs. For in-
stance, we cannot distinguish whether elements were newly created or copied
from somewhere else in case of this simple set of operations. We need to be
able to diﬀerentiate whether a document part was created from scratch or
whether it was copied from somewhere else. Moreover, concerning editing,
me must diﬀerentiate between the creation of new data and the deletion of
existing data. A simple update operation, which only deﬁnes that an element
was changed, is not suﬃcient, since the aforementioned details would not be
captured. Consequently, we need a create operation, a delete operation
and a copy operation for elements and their text content. These operations
must be applicable to entire XML elements or to parts of their text. We also
need the create and delete operation for attributes, because we want to
keep track of their creation and deletion as well. Since we regard attributes
as atomic units, we model the changing of an attribute value with the op-
eration change-attribute. Finally, we need a view operation that is used
when the user wants to view a document or parts of it.
Requirement 3: Record the source and destination of copy operations.
We have illustrated in Situation 2 and Situation 3 that it is relevant for access
control to know from where or to where certain parts of a document were
copied. The source of a document part is an important aspect to determine
its required level of protection. When a document is considered to be top
secret, we also consider copies from it as being top secret. Moreover, to
know to where a document part was copied, is important, too, especially if
the destination is a conﬁdential or top secret document. In these cases, it is
desirable to restrict access to the source parts to avoid information leakage.
As a result, we must record the source and destination when documents parts
are copied to another location. In addition to this, we must be able to use
the gathered information for access control to enable the policies mentioned
in this paragraph.
Requirement 4: Access control for the copy operation.
In Requirement 2, we explained that we need an explicit copy operation as
part of our model. To be able to deﬁne access for situations as Situation 2
and Situation 5, our model must also be able to deﬁne permissions for this
operation. We formulate an individual requirement for this, since having a
copy operation as part of a model does not imply that the model is able to
deﬁne access for that operation. For example, the copy operation can be
internally translated to a pair of read and write operations and access could
38
CHAPTER 3. SCENARIO AND REQUIREMENTS
be deﬁned only for those operations.
Requirement 5: Recording of previous attribute values and the previous
elements in a document.
In Situation 5, we illustrated that some situations require to deﬁne access
based on a previous value of an attribute. We think that many similar
situations can be found in other scenarios as well. Generally speaking, the
knowledge of previous attribute values helps to determine the required level of
protection of a document, because they characterize a document in addition
to its current content. Therefore, our model must record previous values of
attributes and allow to deﬁne access based on that information.
The previous content in form of elements is of also interest, since it also
helps to characterize a document. The knowledge that a speciﬁc element
was contained in a document can be used to specify its required level of
protection. For example, the protection level of a document can be raised if
it has previously contained a top secret element.
Since we require to record the previous values of attributes and the pre-
vious elements in a document, we could also record the previous text content
of these XML elements. But, here again, we assume that attributes and the
text of an XML element diﬀer in their semantics and how they are used. As
stated above, we consider attribute values to have clear deﬁned semantics
and the text content to have less clear deﬁned semantics or undeﬁned se-
mantics. We assume that attributes deﬁne certain properties of an element
and its text content carries continuous text. Without clear deﬁned semantics
it is impractical to write access control rules. As a consequence, we do not
record the previous text content of XML elements.
Requirement 6: Record operations performed by each subject.
We have illustrated in Situation 6 and Situation 7 that some policies depend
on the operations performed by a certain subject. To enable this kind of
policies, we must record the operations performed by each subject. Moreover,
our model must be able to express policies based on that information.
Requirement 7: Record the context of previous operations.
In Situation 7 we gave an example, where access is deﬁned depending on
the subject that performed a previous operation. Besides the subject of a
previous operation, other aspects can be relevant, too. We refer to these
aspects as the context of an operation. This context helps to specify an
object more precisely as it can make the essential diﬀerence when something
was created or who has created an object.
It is an open question which
aspects of the context should be regarded. Our model must record the subject
3.2. REQUIREMENTS
39
that performed an operation, the role the subject was active in and the
time of the operation. We believe that these aspects are the most helpful
ones. Nevertheless, further aspects might be of interest to. Therefore we
require that our model is extendable to handle these additional aspects, too.
