The expression 1.+2 produces 3::Int64 since the expression is parsed as (1) .+
(2) instead of (1.)+(2). It is very surprising (at least to me) that in the .+
operator has higher precedence than the floating literal in the lexer. It also
means that 1.+2 gives a different value than 2+1., which is surprising to me.
I am learning Julia, so please disregard if this is an intentional or well-
documented decision.
