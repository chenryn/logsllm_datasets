User: How can I create an alias for a command in a line-oriented command interpreter implemented using the cmd module?
To create a command, I must implement the do_cmd method. But I have commands with long names (like constraint) and I want to provide aliases (in fact, shortcuts) for these commands (like co). How can I do that?
One possibility that came to my mind is to implement the do_alias (like do_co) method and just calling do_cmd (do_constraint) in this method. But this brings me new commands in the help of the CLI.
Is there any other way to achieve this? Or may be is there a way to hide commands from the help output?
Assistant: The docs mention a default method, which you can override to handle any unknown command. Code it to prefix scan a list of commands and invoke them as you suggest for do_alias.
