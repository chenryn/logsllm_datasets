Abstract

This  workshop  summary  gives  a  brief  overview  of 
the  workshop  on  “Architecting  Dependable  Systems” 
held  in  conjunction  with  DSN  2007.  The  main  aim  of 
this workshop is to promote cross-fertilization between 
the 
dependability 
communities. We believe that both of them will benefit 
from  clarifying  approaches  that  have  been  previously 
tested  and  have  succeeded  as  well  as  those  that  have 
been  tried  but  have  not  yet  been  shown  to  be 
successful.

1. Introduction 
This  workshop  will  conti nue  the  initiative,  which 
started  five  years  ago,  of  bringing  together  the 
international  communities  of  dependability  and 
software  architectures.  The 
first  workshop  on 
Architecting  Dependable  Systems  was  organised 
during  the  International  Conference  on  Software 
Engineering  (ICSE)  2002.  Since  then  six  workshops 
were  organised  and  three 
This  series  of  workshops  have  shown  to  be  a  fertile 
ground  for  both  communities  to  clarify  previous 
approaches, thus helping to promote new topical areas 
where  the  most  promising  research  may  lie,  while 
avoiding the reinvention of the wheel. 
books  were  published  [1]. 
The  main  focus  of  this  series  of  workshops  is  to 
address  at  the  architectural
  level  the  structuring, 
modelling,  and  analysis  of  dependable  software 
systems.  During  DSN  2007  WADS  the  underlying 
theme will be Architecting Critical Infrastructures. 
2. Architecting Dependable Systems 
A  major  challenge  lying  ahead  is  how  to  build 
dependable  systems 
from  existing  undependable 
components  and  systems  that  were  not  originally 
designed 
interact  with  each  other.  These 
components  and  systems  mi ght  not  provide  access  to 
their  internal  designs  and  implementations,  and  they 
to 
the 
interfaces  and 
can evolve independently of the overall system. Based 
on  these  limitations,  the  delivery  of  correct  service, 
and the justification of this ability, has to be obtained 
from 
these 
components and systems. Architectural representations 
of  systems  are  effective  in  understanding  broader 
system  concerns  by  abst
details, hence the trend of addressing dependability at

4.2. Architecting Critical Infrastructures 
This  year  we  are  building  on  the  theme  of 
critical 
electrical  power , 
infrastructures.  Nowadays,  public  health,  economy, 
security  and  quality  of  life  heavily  depend  on  the 
resiliency  of  a  number  of  critical  infrastructures, 
including 
transportation and many others. Therefore, addressing 
the current and future problem s in these various critical 
infrastructure  sectors  is  of  paramount  importance. 
With that in mind, a cons
iderable amount of time will 
be  devoted  to  this  topic,  with  discussions  being 
focused around that area.
