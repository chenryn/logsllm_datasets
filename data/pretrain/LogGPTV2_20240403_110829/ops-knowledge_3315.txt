Certainly! Here is the log converted into a more structured and professional format:

```json

  "timestamp": "2017-06-09T20:10:41",
  "date": "2017-06-09",
  "time": "20:10:41",
  "severity": "INFO",
  "component": "util.Utils",
  "message": "Successfully started service 'sparkExecutorActorSystem' on port 55904.",
  "service_name": "sparkExecutorActorSystem",

}
```
