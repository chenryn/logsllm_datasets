ABSTRACT
Biometric authentication is more secure than using regular
passwords, as biometrics cannot be “forgotten” and contain
high entropy. Thus, many constructions rely on biometric
features for authentication, and use them as a source for
“good” cryptographic keys. At the same time, biometric
systems carry with them many privacy concerns.
We describe a proof-of-concept (PoC) which transforms
facial attributes from a single image into keys in a consis-
tent, discriminative, and privacy-aware manner. The out-
come is a user-speciﬁc string that cannot be guessed, and it
reveals no information concerning the users of the system,
even when the system’s secrets are revealed.

INTRODUCTION
Authentication of users is one of the basic problems of
computer security, and forms the basis for almost any se-
curity mechanism. Passwords, the most popular method,
suﬀer from many pitfalls. To this end, it was suggested to
switch to biometric authentication which is simple (no more
long passwords to memorize that need recovery), and secure
(as they contain a suﬃcient amount of entropy to replace
passwords). Biometric authentication, whilst useful, carries
an inherent problem: the user’s privacy, or more precisely
his biometric information’s privacy is at danger.
Unlike passwords which are hashed to protect them in the
case the password ﬁle is exposed, due to the fuzziness in
the sampling of biometric-based values, a diﬀerent solution
is needed. A possible solution is the secure sketch of [8]:
During the acquisition process, when the biometric repre-
sentation x is obtained, a sketch s is also produced.1 The
1The sketch s is error-correction information used whenever
the user is sampled again.

value of s is given to the user, and the system stores the
value of F (x, s). Both F (·) and s are chosen such that if x(cid:48)
is “close” to x, F (x, s) = F (x(cid:48), s), thus overcoming the in-
herent fuzziness.2 The problem with secure sketches is their
reliance on the uniform distribution of x, which many face
recognition algorithms do not deliver (e.g., [3, 9]).
A possible solution to the problem is the use of fuzzy
extractors [5]. However, to truly oﬀer a secure solution,
the fuzzy extractor should start with high min-entropy, as
noted by Ballard et al. [1] (see Sutcu et. al [13] for a detailed
discussion). Otherwise, one can easily overcome the system
by a simple guessing attack on the output of F (·).
1.1 Our Contribution
In this work we present a biometric key derivation sys-
tem3 which is based on face recognition with a new face
representation, oﬀering the following properties:
1. Consistent and Discriminative — for a zero False Ac-
ceptance Rate (FAR), we have obtained a False Rejec-
tion Rate (FRR) of 0.19.
2. High min-entropy — we combine many simple fea-
tures, each with close to optimal min-entropy (follow-
ing [7]) into a high min-entropy string. Thus, our sys-
tem can rely on secure sketch with no need for fuzzy
extractors.
3. Provable security — the generated keys are computa-
tionally indistinguishable from random strings.
4. Fast face recognition — compared with other biometric
extraction techniques, our system uses only projection
operations and hamming-distance computations.
5. Provable privacy — our system protects the biometric
templates when the system’s information is compro-
mised. Given s, F (x, s), and our algorithm’s internal
values, to determine whether a user is enrolled, the
adversary must sample his biometrics x.4
1.2 Previous Work
A large volume of work on protecting biometric templates
appeared in recent years (see [12] for detailed discussion).
While these works usually oﬀer good identiﬁcation, they suf-
fer from several security and/or privacy issues:5 short cryp-
tographic keys; non-uniform distribution of binary strings
used as inputs in fuzzy commitment and other noise tolerant
constructions; dependency between bits of the key (resulting
in low entropy); auxiliary data leaks personal information;
2For security F (x, s) (cid:54)= F (x(cid:48), s) for x far from x(cid:48).
3We note that transforming it into an authentication system
is trivial, e.g., storing F (x, s) pairs and a corresponding UID.
4This property is the strong privacy deﬁnitions of [1].
5All prior work we are aware of suﬀer from at least one of
these shortcomings.

no protection of user’s biometric against adversaries with
access to the cryptographic key.
For example, the scheme of [9] uses Gabor kernels on im-
ages of faces. As shown by [16], there are high-order correla-
tions between diﬀerent channels of the Gabor transform, i.e,
the bits produces by this transform are correlated as well.
The Random Multispace Quantization (RMQ) [14] method
transforms biometric features (Fisherfaces [2]) into the se-
cret using user-speciﬁc orthonormal random projection fol-
lowed by thresholding. The random projections are deﬁned
by a secret seed released to the user for the identiﬁcation
phase and the secret is stored in the system. While the ad-
versary cannot retrieve the original biometric template from
the secret, it can be approximated by the pseudoinverse of
the projection matrix, computed from the secret seed.6
Another privacy issue user-speciﬁc training phase. For
example, [6] uses Fisherfaces, whose dimension is related to
the number of users in the system, which implies that the
system’s training was done on the users of the system. Stor-
ing Fisherfaces in the clear leaks a lot of information about
the faces that were used to construct them (e.g., Fig. 1).
2. OUR CONSTRUCTION
In a nutshell, our construction generates keys by concate-
nating many independent “short” keys (yielding suﬃcient
entropy) following [7], which are obtained by embedding the
biometric samples into a high-dimensional Hamming space.
The embedding W is generated once by the learning algo-
rithm (described below) using a public data, unrelated to
the users of the system (thus W contains no private infor-
mation). W is then used to transform the biometric samples
into binary strings. To overcome the remaining fuzziness in
the binary strings, we use the code-oﬀset construction of [5]
(which is the fuzzy commitment of [8] for F = {0, 1}).
Biometric Sampling: Each image in the system is trans-
formed to a canonical pose by localizing facial landmarks
and aligning the face to a predeﬁned canonical pose (us-
ing the landmarks). This process is followed by biometric
feature extraction, in which we compute LBP and SIFT de-
scriptors for 21 facial regions and HOG on the cropped face
(116× 106 pixels). We concatenate all descriptors ([18]) and
reduce their dimension to 700 using PCA.
Generation of W : We generate a K-bit Hamming embed-
ding, using K binary hash functions.7 For the zero-mean
data, the k-th hash function is deﬁned as 1/2(sgn(wT
k x)+1),
where x ∈ RD is a data point and wk is a projection vec-
6It was observed in [10] that the seed is unique, and thus
the projection matrix can serve as a user identity.
7We alert the reader that the term which we use follow the
face recognition community one, and does not refer to one-
way hash functions.
tor. The learning problem is to ﬁnd set of vectors W =
[w1, . . . , wK ] in RD, with (cid:107)wk(cid:107)2 = 1 that produces the em-
bedding and gives the same bits for samples of the same
person and diﬀerent bits for samples of diﬀerent people.
To optimize the entropy of the key, we maximize the en-
tropy of each bit and make them mutually independent. It
