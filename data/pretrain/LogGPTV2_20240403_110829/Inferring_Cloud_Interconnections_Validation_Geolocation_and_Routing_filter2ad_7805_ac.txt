also indicate Frankfurt. In (b) we use gru in the hostname for b4 to infer that the
interconnection occurs in Sao Paulo. (Color ﬁgure online)
4.3 Geolocating Cloud Interconnections
Next, we use IXP location constraints and geolocation tags in Azure hostnames to
infer the locations of interconnections between the clouds. For IXP constraints, we
identify all addresses that preceded an interconnection address in a traceroute that
also preceded an IXP address, and infer that the interconnection is located at the
IXP location recorded in PeeringDB. Our reasoning follows from the fact that inter-
connected routers operated by two diﬀerent networks are often located in the same
facility or city. In Fig. 9a, bdrmapIT inferred that address 198.200.130.255 inter-
connects Azure and GCP, and the prior address 104.44.232.128 also preceded
an address used for public peering at DE-CIX Frankfurt in a diﬀerent traceroute,
so we conclude that the interconnection using address 198.200.130.255 occurs
in Frankfurt. Remote peering at IXPs, where a network participates at multiple
IXPs through a port at a single IXP, creates the possibility that our method could
identify multiple IXPs. We expect to more often observe local IXP peering than
remote peering, so in the event our technique identiﬁed multiple IXPs, we select
the most frequently appearing IXP city location.
We also used geographic locations embedded in Azure IP hostnames to geolo-
cate interconnections involving Azure, such as the reference to Frankfurt in the
hostname for 198.200.130.255, google.fra-96cbe-1b.ntwk.msn.net. We col-
lected hostnames for three groups of addresses most likely to reside in the same
city as the interconnection: (1) the interconnection address, (2) addresses that pre-
cede the interconnection address, and (3) the other address in the /31 subnet of
addresses subsequent to the interconnection address. For the latter group, while the
subsequent addresses might not reside in the interconnection city, we assume the
other address in the point-to-point subnet likely belongs to the same router as the
interconnection address. In Fig. 9b, we use the hostname for 104.44.24.40 which
we infer belongs to the same router as the interconnection address 99.82.177.85,
despite not appearing in the traceroutes. Using a hand-crafted regular expression,
we extracted the geolocation codes, and mapped each code to a city. This tech-
nique always inferred a single city for each interconnection address. Using both

techniques allowed us to infer geolocations for every Azure link, and the two tech-
niques never inferred conﬂicting cities.
Our two geolocation strategies yielded the city locations in Fig. 10. We found
that the clouds interconnect in all six populated continents and tend to inter-
connect in the same locations. The IXP constraints provided locations for 87.8%
and 80.4% of the Azure-GCP and Azure-AWS interconnections respectively, but
only geolocated 34.4% of the AWS–GCP interconnections, since many of their
interconnection IP addresses did not share a common predecessor with an IXP
address. Interconnections visible from AWS VMs rarely shared a predecessor
with an IXP address, and the GCP traceroutes often lacked internal hops. The
congruity between the two techniques indicates that these techniques can accu-
rately geolocate many of the cloud interconnections visible in traceroute.
5 Limitiations
Our analysis performs inferences on top of inferences, and an error at any step
can lead to false conclusions. Acknowledging the potential for compounding
error, we validated as many of our interconnection and geolocation inferences
as possible. In general, we expect our analysis to reﬂect the reality revealed by
our traceroutes, despite imperfect accuracy.
One limitation of our validation is that we rely on the accuracy of Azure’s
DNS hostnames, but operators might not update them when an IP address
switches from one router interface to another. While this might apply to our
case, the 97.4% congruity between bdrmapIT AS operator inferences and the
hostname tags suggests that Azure maintains its hostnames well. The coverage
of our validation is a more fundamental limitation, as our validation dataset
242
A. Marder et al.
covers a single cloud network and only 30.3% of the total number of bdrmapIT
inferred Azure private interconnection IP addresses. Our reported bdrmapIT AS
operator accuracy might not generalize to the other Azure interconnections that
bdrmapIT inferred, let alone to AWS and GCP interconnections.
When inferring cloud neighbors, our traceroutes might not reveal all of the
interconnections between the cloud networks, and between the clouds and neigh-
boring networks. In GCP, most traceroute paths either start outside of GCP or
the VMs do not receive a reply from the apparent interconnection router hop
(Fig. 8a). Speciﬁc to AWS, its hot-potato routing means that traﬃc to a con-
nected AS might leave the WAN at a diﬀerent neighbor closer to the the VM. For
all three clouds, a traceroute only reveals a single active path, and our probing
might miss alternate active paths. Furthermore, our probing can only reveal net-
works interconnected with cloud public WANs, but some networks interconnect
with clouds in a more private fashion.
Yeganeh et al. [56] described cloud exchanges as multipoint-to-point inter-
connections that use address space provided by the exchange operator, and spec-
ulated that bdrmapIT cannot draw accurate AS operator inferences for routers
at cloud exchanges. We do not expect cloud exchanges to pose problems for
bdrmapIT’s AS operator inferences, since it determines AS ownership by look-
ing forward from a router to addresses seen subsequently in a traceroute. This
allows bdrmapIT to determine ownership for IXP public peering addresses, and
it should perform similarly for the cloud exchanges Yeganeh et al. described. A
potential consequence of cloud exchanges is that our methodology for inferring
next-hop networks might select the cloud exchange provider as the next-hop AS
if the exchange does not use address space belonging to a cloud or list its address
space in PeeringDB or IXPDB.
6 Conclusion
Public clouds play a central role in the modern Internet, but we know little about
how they interconnect to each other or other networks. Understanding cloud
connectivity is critical to studying the modern Internet, including for network
planning and diagnosis, and resiliency assessments. This study lays a founda-
tion for future analyses by validating and improving a technique to infer cloud
interconnection IP addresses. We analyzed next-hop ASes that the clouds use
to reach other networks and proposed techniques to geolocate interconnections
between the clouds. We found that clouds interconnect with each other on all six
populated continents, and that next-hop ASes can be region-dependent, indicat-
ing that properly analyzing cloud networks requires measurements from every
region. We will make FAST and the code for our analysis available at https://
alexmarder.github.io/cloud-pam21/.

A Recent GCP Traceroute Behavior
Inferring Cloud Interconnections
243
Fig. 11. Unlike the traceroute in October, 2020, the traceroute from GCP Los Angeles
to UPenn in February, 2021 revealed an internal GCP IP addresses (a). The ﬁrst
responsive hop in the traceroute from Virginia was an address on a UPenn router, but
the path contained unresponsive hops until that point (b).
We conducted the traceroutes in Sect. 4.1 in October, 2020. Revisiting our
examples in February, 2021, we noticed a diﬀerent behavior. Many paths still
do not contain any internal GCP addresses, but the paths no longer appear to
start in neighboring networks. As seen in the traceroute path from GCP Los
Angeles to UPenn (Fig. 11a), hop #1 is an internal GCP address followed by
the interconnection with Internet2 at hop #2 [10], rather than a UPenn address.
The ﬁrst responsive hop in the path from our GCP Virginia VM (Fig. 11b) is
the same UPenn address that we previously observed as hop #1 in Sect. 4.1, but
hop #1 is now an unresponsive address. This behavior makes interpreting GCP
traceroutes more intuitive, as they follow conventional traceroute semantics, but
observing GCP internal addresses still appears to depend on the combination of
VM region and traceroute destination.
