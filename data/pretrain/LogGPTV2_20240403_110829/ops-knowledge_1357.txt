User: I have a program which provides a command line input like this:
python2.6 prog.py -p a1 b1 c1
Now, we can have any number of input parameters i.e. -p a1 and -p a1 c1 b1 e2 are both possibilities.
I want to create a tuple based on the variable input parameters. Any suggestions on how to do this would be very helpful! A fixed length tuple would be easy, but I am not sure how to implement a variable length one.
thanks.
Assistant: Iterate through sys.argv until you reach another flag.
