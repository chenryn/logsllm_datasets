User: In development, it's a bit of a hassle to run the celeryd as well as the Django development server. Is it possible to, for example, ask celery to run tasks synchronously during development? Or something similar?
Assistant: After 5+ years of writing Celery tasks I have noticed a pattern I have developed that can help with testing and ease of development - I realised it is much better if my Celery tasks are thin wrappers around the regular Python functions that I typically put in myproject.impl package. Celery tasks may contain some strictly Celery related logic, like using distributed locking for an example, explicit retry logic, etc.
