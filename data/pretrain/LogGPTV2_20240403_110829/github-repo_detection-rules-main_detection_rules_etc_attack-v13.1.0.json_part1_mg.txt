Compare recent invocations of CMSTP.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Sysmon events can also be used to identify potential abuses of CMSTP.exe. Detection strategy may depend on the specific adversary procedure, but potential rules include: (Citation: Endurant CMSTP July 2018)\n* To detect loading and execution of local/remote payloads - Event 1 (Process creation) where ParentImage contains CMSTP.exe\n* Also monitor for events, such as the creation of processes (Sysmon Event 1), that involve auto-elevated CMSTP COM interfaces such as CMSTPLUA (3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7) and CMLUAUTIL (3E000D72-A845-4CD9-BD83-80C07C3B881F).\n\n Implementation 1 : CMSTP  \n\n Detection Pseudocode \n processes = filter processes where (\n  (event_id == \"1\" OR event_id == \"4688\") AND \n  exe == \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\CMSTP.exe\" AND\n  src_ip NOT IN [\"10.0.0.0/8\", \"192.168.0.0/16\", \"172.16.0.0/12\"] ) \n\n Detection Notes \n\n- Pseudocode Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). \n- The Detection Pseudocode looks for the creation of a new CMSTP.exe process which initiates a network connection to a non-local IP address.
