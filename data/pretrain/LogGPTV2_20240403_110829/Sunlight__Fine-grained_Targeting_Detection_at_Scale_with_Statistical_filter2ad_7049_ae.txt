### (b) Coverage, Websites
**Figure 7: Coverage.** This figure shows the proportion of ads each algorithm found out of all ads found by at least one algorithm.

#### Details:
- **X-axis:** Log scale of p-values
- **Y-axis:** Number of ads
- **Algorithms:**
  - **Logit:** 1500 ads
  - **Set Intersection:** 1000 ads

### (a) P-value CDF (Gmail)
**Figure 8: Effect of p-value correction on the distribution.** The Set Intersection algorithm generates more hypotheses, resulting in more low p-value hypotheses. After applying Holm's correction, the Logit algorithm has more low p-value hypotheses. The X-axis is on a log scale.

#### Observations:
- **Before Correction:**
  - Set Intersection: 836 hypotheses with p-value < 5%
  - Logit: 486 hypotheses with p-value < 5%
- **After Holm's Correction:**
  - Logit retains 80% more low p-value hypotheses compared to Set Intersection.

### (b) Same as (a) with Holm
**Figure 8: Effect of p-value correction on the distribution.** 
- **Set Intersection:** Outputs the most low p-value hypotheses but has poor predictive power (precision below 50%).
- **Logit Stage 1:** After the strictest correction (Holm), it provides the best coverage with 93% on Gmail and 94% on Websites, outperforming Lm, Bayesian, and Set Intersection.
- **BY Correction:** On the Websites dataset, Logit has a lower coverage (about 80%) but higher precision in ad prediction.

### Explanation
The superior coverage of Set Intersection before correction is due to the large number of hypotheses it generates, including many high p-value ones. After p-value correction, especially with Holm's method, the penalty for multiple testing increases, leading to fewer significant hypotheses. Logit, which generates fewer but higher-quality hypotheses, retains more low p-value hypotheses post-correction.

### 6.5 Q4: Confidence at Scale
**Figure 9: Effect of p-value correction on the distribution at different scales.**
- **(a) P-value Distribution:**
  - Website-large: 75% of hypotheses with p-value < 5%
  - Website: 88% of hypotheses with p-value < 5%
- **(b) P-value Distribution after BY Correction:**
  - Website-large: 46% of hypotheses with p-value < 5%
  - Website: 74% of hypotheses with p-value < 5%
- **(c) P-value Distribution after Holm Correction:**
  - Website: 88% to 61%
  - Website-large: 75% to 21%

#### Observations:
1. **Hypotheses are harder to make on larger datasets.**
2. **Holm correction significantly reduces low p-values, especially in large datasets.**
3. **BY correction is milder, making it a useful trade-off for large datasets.**

### 6.6 Anecdotal Experience with the Data
**Manual Assessment of Hypotheses:**
- **Precision:**
  - 95% for Gmail
  - 96% for Websites
- **False Positives:**
  - Associations that could not be semantically explained, e.g., "www.eaglecreek.com" targeting "Cheap drugs online order."

#### Example:
- **True Positive:** Ad for a ski resort targeting "Ski" email.
- **False Positive:** Ad for a luggage company targeting "Cheap drugs online order" email, despite strong data support.

### Conclusion
- **High-confidence hypotheses** provide good predictors of ad presence.
- **Manual labeling** is error-prone and highlights the difficulty in assessing associations.
- **Algorithms like Logit** that generate fewer, high-quality hypotheses are more robust to p-value corrections, especially in large-scale experiments.
