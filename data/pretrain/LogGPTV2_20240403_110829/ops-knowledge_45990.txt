User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题logrotate status files extremely large Apache2 on an Ubuntu 16.04 box was showing issues on the websites it's hosting. It was at 100% capacity. Looking further with du, The majority of the ~100gb hard drive was filled by two files in /var/lib/logrotate/. 

logrotate has files in there which are called /var/lib/logrotate/status and /var/lib/logrotate/status.clean and taking up a lot of space... 30gb and 60gb. 

I'm aware that logrotate is used to regularly clear log files but it seems that it doesn't clear it's own 'log' files by default. I resolved the disk space issue by deleting the two files in there rm -rf /var/lib/logrotate/*. 

(/var/lib/logrotate/status has repopulated with new logs from rotate processes throughout the day)

Is this something that is going to keep happening if logrotate doesn't rotate it's own logs?

Assistant: Deleting or rotating the logrotate.status file is only a band-aid.  You need to take a step backward and ask the question, "why is the logrotate.status file that large?"

I would tail -n 500 that status file and see what files are listed in there.  I think there's a real strong possibility that your logrotate config file(s) are rotating stuff you never intended to be rotated.
