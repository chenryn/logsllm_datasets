### Table 5: Results on Open-World Dataset

In Table 5, all non-monitored websites are grouped into an additional class. Thus, the evaluation metrics are calculated over 51 classes, including 50 monitored and one non-monitored class. BAPM outperforms other methods, achieving approximately 80% and 60% accuracy for the first and second tabs, respectively. As the number of non-monitored websites increases, the performance of all four methods tends to decrease. This is because a larger set of non-monitored websites is more likely to include traces with direction patterns similar to those of monitored websites, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The difference in results between the two tabs is particularly noticeable in the open-world setting.

### 7. Discussion

#### 7.1 Real-World Dataset Analysis

To verify the effectiveness of BAPM when attackers use manual traces for training and testing on real traces, we conducted experiments using a real-world dataset. We installed a Tor proxy on a VPS host and used a headless Chrome browser to visit target websites through the proxy. An automated script continuously visited the top 50 websites listed by Alexa on March 18, 2021. For the training set, we captured 200 traces per website, resulting in 10,000 manual traces. For the testing set, we captured 1,000 real traces by opening the first page, waiting a few seconds, and then opening the second page in a new thread. The loading time was uniformly set to 15 seconds. We cleared browser cookies and waited a few seconds before each capture, as suggested by [24]. We used the tool provided in [24] to extract cell directions from the traces as model input. There were no ethical issues since we did not provide the proxy service for any other anonymous users.

#### Table 6: Results on Real-World Multi-Tab Packet Traces

| Page | BAPM | PSP-WF | PSE-WF | Multi-DF |
|------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **1st** | 93.2 | 27.6 | 70.7 | 50.5 |
| **2nd** | 93.5 | 57.7 | 81.4 | 50.0 |
| **Accuracy (Acc)** | 92.9 | 27.3 | 70.3 | 51.4 |
| **Precision (Pre)** | 82.9 | 8.2 | 70.5 | 46.9 |
| **Recall (Rec)** | 84.9 | 11.4 | 80.7 | 46.8 |

As shown in Table 6, BAPM, PSE-WF, and Multi-DF achieved better results on real traces. We hypothesize that different page tabs in the real world may have exclusive time slices for data transmission, while manually merged traces do not account for this and simply mix the data according to timestamps. The exception is PSP-WF, whose results declined, indicating that overlapping points in manual and real traces may have different characteristics. In summary, real traces do not diminish the effectiveness of BAPM, and the reasons mentioned in Section 5.2 for choosing manual traces as the training set are valid.

#### 7.2 Possible Defenses Analysis

Like other WF attacks, injecting random traffic noise into original packet traces can disrupt the fingerprints extracted by BAPM. The noise can come from:
1. **Simultaneous Page Tabs:** In our experiments, we focused on multi-tab scenarios where users "successively" rather than "simultaneously" visit websites. "Successively" visiting is common, while "simultaneously" visiting involves deliberately opening extra tabs at the same time, which mixes concurrent page tabs and confuses attackers.
2. **Non-Browsing Behaviors:** During web browsing, non-browsing activities generate irrelevant traffic, which also disturbs the original traces. Since the traffic noise is unpredictable, all WF works will be affected to some extent.

The core principle of BAPM is to find local direction patterns specific to a website, especially in overlapping areas. When two tabs are involved, the blocks still reflect the specific website's pattern. However, random noise severely disrupts these patterns under simultaneous tabs or non-browsing behaviors, making it harder to discover block relations. A simple test showed that adding the third and fourth tabs as random noise reduced the accuracy for the second tab to almost random decision levels, indicating that multi-tab fingerprints are no longer effective. Therefore, managing the influence of simultaneous tabs or non-browsing behaviors during browsing can help defend against potential multi-tab WF attacks.

### 8. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed BAPM, a deep learning WF attacking model designed to handle multi-tab browsing behavior. BAPM transforms cell direction sequences, including overlapping and non-overlapping areas, into blocked tab-aware representations, avoiding information confusion at both the tab and block levels. Additionally, we applied a multi-head attention mechanism to aggregate blocks from the same specific website, generating a representation variety for each attention head. This allows for the simultaneous prediction of multiple website labels without the need to accurately predetermine website locations in raw packet traces. BAPM outperformed several well-known multi-tab WF attacks in comparison experiments, and its design effectiveness was explained through comprehensive analysis.

This work advances the feasibility of WF attacks on Tor, reminding users that their privacy can be threatened even in more realistic multi-tab scenarios. We also introduced possible defenses against our model and discussed how fingerprints break with these defenses. Users can protect themselves by consciously making some noise if they do not use the proposed countermeasures. Future research could explore extended scenarios, such as fingerprint drift over time or designing multi-tab WF models against countermeasures.
