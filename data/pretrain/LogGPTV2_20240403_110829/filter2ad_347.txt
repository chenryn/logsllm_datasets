ABSTRACT
The Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW) focuses
on the security challenges and opportunities raised by cloud
computing. The “cloud” is a general term for aggregation
of computing resources within an extensive, elastic environ-
ment typically marked by a high degree of resource virtu-
alization and sharing among tenants. As a multi-faceted
trend, cloud computing creates many and varied security
and privacy requirements at the intersection of a broad range
of disciplines. The goal of the workshop is to elucidate the
security and privacy problems raised by cloud computing
and foster understanding of the connection between research
and practice in this vibrant and transformative area.

INTRODUCTION
There are many deﬁnitions of the “cloud” and many histor-
ical and contemporary synonyms and subcategories (utility
computing, grid computing, PaaS, etc.). All of these terms
and ideas point toward the same trend: A consolidation of
computing, storage, and networking resources within a sin-
gle, typically shared infrastructure. Naturally, with many
stakeholders and users operating side-by-side in a cloud en-
vironment, the security and privacy challenges are legion.
But the news isn’t all bad. Cloud computing also oﬀers
opportunities to improve security through the judicious use

of virtualization, consolidation of security administrator du-
ties, and general opportunities for rethinking security engi-
neering in a new, centralized platform.
Since its inception in 2009, CCSW has become the pre-
mier venue for research on security and privacy in cloud
computing. It has also produced some of the most popular
and highly cited papers in the CCS family of workshops, and
drawn an excellent and diverse range of invited speakers.
The workshop aims to bring together researchers and prac-
titioners in all security aspects of cloud-centric and out-
sourced computing. Like CCS, its parent conference, CCSW
oﬀers a program spanning a broad range of topics and dis-
ciplines, including network security, consumer privacy, vir-
tualization security, secure hardware, and cryptography—to
name just a few.
2. TOPICS OF INTEREST
The broad scope of CCSW is best reﬂected in the topics
of interest enumerated in the workshop call for papers:
• Practical cryptographic protocols for cloud security
• Secure cloud resource virtualization mechanisms
• Secure data management outsourcing (e.g., database
as a service)
• Practical privacy and integrity mechanisms for out-
sourcing
• Foundations of cloud-centric threat models
• Secure computation outsourcing
• Remote attestation mechanisms in clouds
• Sandboxing and VM-based enforcements
• Trust and policy management in clouds
• Secure identity management mechanisms
• New cloud-aware web service security paradigms and
mechanisms
• Cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mech-
anisms
• Business and security risk models and clouds
• Cost and usability models and their interaction with
security in clouds
• Scalability of security in global-size clouds
• Trusted computing technology and clouds
• Binary analysis of software for remote attestation and
cloud protection
• Network security (DOS, IDS etc.) mechanisms for
cloud contexts
• Security for emerging cloud programming models
• Energy/cost/eﬃciency of security in clouds
