If I navigate to an Angular SPA from another page (outside the SPA), I have to
click back twice to return to where I was. When the page first loads a
duplicate history entry is created. If I keep refreshing the SPA page, the
history gets longer and longer...
Some initial investigation shows that:
  * The problem does not occur if the URL that serves the SPA does not match any defined routes.
  * The problem does not occur for applications that have no routing configuration.
Possibly related to #5025 ?
