After installing the 1.8.4.0 TypeScript tools for Visual Studio 2015, I encountered an unexpected build error:

```
Build: File 'COMPUTE_PATHS_ONLY.ts' not found.
```

Upon investigating other instances of this error, I explored the following directories:
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0\TypeScript`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v15.0\TypeScript`

I noticed that both v14.0 and v15.0 directories were present, even though I do not have Visual Studio 2017 (v15.0) installed.

As an experiment, I replaced the `Microsoft.TypeScript.targets` file in the v14.0 directory with the one from the v15.0 directory, and the issue was resolved.

Is it possible that the v15.0 files were mistakenly installed, or is there another explanation for this issue?
