After installing the 1.8.4.0 VS 2015 Typescript tools I'm getting an
unexpected build error:
Build: File 'COMPUTE_PATHS_ONLY.ts' not found.
After perusing other issues with this error I dug into
C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0\Typescript
And also found
C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v15.0\Typescript
I don't know if it's related but for giggles I replaced the
Microsoft.TypeScript.targets in v14.0 with the same file I found in v15.0 and
the issue went away. Is this v15 stuff mis-installed? I don't have a VS v15.
