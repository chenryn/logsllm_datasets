User: I have a directory which hosts all of my Django apps (C:\My_Projects). I want to add this directory to my PYTHONPATH so I can call the apps directly.
I tried adding C:\My_Projects\; to my Windows Path variable from the Windows GUI (My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables). But it still doesn't read the coltrane module and generates this error:

Error: No module named coltrane
Assistant: The python 2.X paths can be set from few of the above instructions.
Python 3 by default will be installed in 
C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\
So this path has to be added to Path variable in windows environment.
