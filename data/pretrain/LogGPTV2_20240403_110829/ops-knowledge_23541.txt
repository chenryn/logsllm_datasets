To add your Django apps directory (C:\My_Projects) to the PYTHONPATH, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the System Properties: Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer', and select 'Properties'. Then click on 'Advanced system settings'.
2. In the System Properties window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.
3. In the Environment Variables window, locate the 'System variables' section, and look for a variable named `PYTHONPATH`. If it does not exist, create one by clicking on the 'New' button. If it already exists, select it and click on 'Edit'.
4. In the Edit or New window, set the 'Variable value' field to include your Django apps directory. Add `C:\My_Projects;` to the end of the existing value, or if it's a new variable, just enter `C:\My_Projects;`.
5. Click 'OK' to close all the windows.

After adding the directory to the PYTHONPATH, you should be able to import and use your Django apps directly. 

However, if you still encounter the error "No module named coltrane", make sure that the `coltrane` module is indeed located in the `C:\My_Projects` directory. Additionally, verify that the Python version you are using is compatible with the `coltrane` module and that the module is correctly installed.

For Python 3, the default installation path is typically something like:
```
C:\Users\<Your_Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3X-XX\
```
where `X` and `XX` represent the version number. Ensure that this path is also included in the `Path` environment variable if you are using Python 3.

If you continue to experience issues, double-check the following:
- The `coltrane` module is in the correct directory.
- The `PYTHONPATH` and `Path` environment variables are correctly set.
- You are using the correct Python interpreter (e.g., running `python` or `python3` from the command line).

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "No module named coltrane" error and successfully import and use your Django apps.
