I noticed earlier that the compile time of `image` increased massively during
the beginning of 2015. Unfortunately it was hard to quantify this regression
since we also changed a lot during this time.
Fortunately I just found a good example that shows a 20-fold increase in
compile time. It is a single file with no other dependencies (if somebody
wants to try: the original version is even much older). The two revisions are
exactly the same code, the newer just has been updated to compile on a recent
rustc. Note that this is `rustc` only, no time is spend in llvm.
    $ sudo rustc --version
    rustc 0.13.0-nightly (7608dbad6 2014-12-31 10:06:21 -0800)
    $ time sudo rustc --crate-type=lib -Z no-trans inflate.rs
    real    0m1.176s
    user    0m1.059s
    sys 0m0.113s
(note that something is wrong with the old .pkg-file I used to install rustc,
I need to use sudo to run it)
    $ rustc --version
    rustc 1.1.0-nightly (c4b23aec4 2015-04-29) (built 2015-04-28)
    $ time rustc --crate-type=lib -Z no-trans inflate.rs
    real    0m25.208s
    user    0m23.919s
    sys 0m1.213s
The time profiles show that `driver::phase_1_parse_input` and
`driver::phase_2_configure_and_expand` almost stayed constant while the time
spent in `driver::phase_3_run_analysis_passes` exploded.
