User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SCP Asking for Password with RSA Key I've followed a few tutorials on setting up RSA Public Key Authentication, but I cannot seem to get it to work.  I can SSH into the remote machine without a password, but when I try and scp files, I still get prompted for a password even though it accepts the key...

This is the output...
