Is there any way to combine two different kernels in scikit-learn for
different dimensions?  
For example, if there is two input dimensions in GP, is there any way to
define:
K((x,y),(x',y') = k(x,x') * k(y,y')  
More precisely, how can we define active dimension for each of them?  
Thanks for consideration.
