performance. We classify these two groups by examining the IP
address field of introducers in each RouterInfo file.
I2P provides a way for peers behind NAT or firewalls to commu-
nicate with the rest of the network, using third-party introduction
points (aka introducers) [31]. An I2P peer (e.g., Bob) who resides be-
hind a firewall that blocks unsolicited inbound packets, can choose
some peers in the network to become his introducers. Each of these
introducers creates an introduction tag for Bob. These tags are
then made available to the public as a way to communicate with
Bob. Having Bob’s public tags, another peer (e.g., Alice) sends a
request packet to one of the introducers, asking it to introduce her
to Bob. The introducer then forwards the request to Bob by includ-
ing Alice’s public IP and port number, and sends a response back
to Alice, containing Bob’s public IP and port number. Once Bob
receives Alice’s information, he sends out a small random packet
to Alice’s IP and port, thus punching a hole in his firewall for Alice
to communicate with him.
By examining the IP address field of the introduction points in
RouterInfos, we can differentiate between firewalled and hidden
peers. A firewalled peer has information about its introducers em-
bedded in the RouterInfo, while a hidden peer does not. Figure 6
shows the number of peers in each group. In total, there are more
than 15K unknown-IP peers per day, which consist of roughly 14K
firewalled peers and 4K hidden peers. Between these two groups,
there are about 2.6K overlapping peers. In other words, there are
2.6K I2P peers per day that have their status changing between
firewalled and hidden.
5.2 Churn Rate
I2P is a dynamic P2P network in which peers come and leave fre-
quently. Prior to this work, Timpanaro et al. [65] conducted the first
churn study of I2P and reported the probability of an I2P peer going
offline after 30 minutes to be around 15%. However, the experiment
was conducted for only five days, and only eight floodfill routers
were deployed. Liu et al. [40] ran their experiment for around two
weeks and reported that 19.03% of the collected peers survived for

one day, while 48.66% of them survived more than seven days. Over-
all, these works were conducted over a short period of time and on
a small scale, providing an incomplete view of the churn rate of
the I2P network. Moreover, none of the previous studies mentioned
the address changing phenomenon of peers in the network, which
often happens due to the fact that most ISPs do not usually allocate
a static IP address to residential Internet connections. In this section,
we analyze the collected RouterInfos to fill these research gaps.
5.2.1 Peer Longevity. Figure 7 illustrates the churn rate of I2P
peers during our three-month measurement. As shown in Figure 7,
the percentages of peers staying in the network for more than
seven days are 56.36% (continuously) and 73.93% (intermittently).
That percentages of peers online longer than 30 days are 20.03%
(continuously) and 31.15% (intermittently). Although I2P is a purely
distributed and dynamic P2P network, these results imply that
more than half of the peers stay stably in the network more than
a week. Compared with the churn rate of 48.66% in 2014 [40], our
findings of both continuous and intermittent churn rates show that
the network is becoming more stable.

IP Address Churn. Since most ISPs do not allocate a static
5.2.2
IP address for residential Internet connections, it is common for
peers to be associated with more than one IP address. As shown
in Figure 8, there are 63K peers that are associated with a single IP
address (45% of known-IP peers), while more than 76K known-IP
peers (55%) are associated with at least two IP addresses. Moreover,
we notice a small group of 460 peers that are associated with more
than a hundred IP addresses during a period of three months, occu-
pying 0.65% of the total number of known-IP peers. We characterize
this phenomenon in Section 5.3.2 when we study the geographic
distribution of I2P peers.
5.3 Peer Distribution
Peers in the I2P network are classified with different capacity flags
based on their (1) operating mode (floodfill vs. non-floodfill), (2)
reachability (whether or not they are reachable by other peers), and
(3) shared bandwidth [34]. These capacity flags, denoted by a single
capital letter, are stored in the RouterInfo file of each peer. We are
interested in understanding the percentage of each peer type in
the I2P network. Prior to this study, Liu et al. [40] analyzed the
distribution of I2P peers across countries. However, the multiple IP
addresses phenomenon necessitates a more thorough approach for
analyzing peers that change address frequently. As mentioned in
Section 5.2.2, more than half of the known-IP peers are associated
with two or more IP addresses. In this section, we analyze two
aspects of I2P peers: capacity and geographic distribution.
5.3.1 Peer Capacity Distribution. Capacity flags are used by peers
in the network for basic decisions, such as peer selection for creating
tunnels, and floodfill router selection for submitting RouterInfo and
LeaseSet information. The status of a peer is determined as follows:
• A floodfill router is denoted by an f flag in its capacity field,
while a non-floodfill router does not have this flag.
• The estimated shared bandwidth range of a peer is indicated
by one of seven available letters: K, L, M, N, O, P, and X, which
correspond to less than 12KB/s, 12–48 KB/s, 48–64 KB/s, 64–
128 KB/s, 128-256 KB/s, 256-2000 KB/s, and more than 2000
KB/s, respectively.
• The reachability of a peer is defined by R (reachable) or U
(unreachable).
For example, the OfR flags found in the capacity field of a peer,
mean that the peer is a reachable floodfill router with a shared band-
width of 128–256 KB/s. Analyzing these capacity flags provides us
a better understanding of peer capacity distribution in the network,
and allows us to accurately estimate the total amount of peers in
the network.
Our analysis in Figure 9 shows that L-flagged peers are the most
dominant in the network, with an average of about 21K peers per
day. This result complies with the fact that the L flag is the default
shared bandwidth of the I2P router software. With more than 9K
peers on a daily basis, N is the second most dominant peer type.
P, X, O, M, and K peers have an average of 2.1K, 1.8K, 875, 400, and
360 peers per day, respectively. In terms of operation mode, we ob-
served an average of 2.7K floodfill peers per day, which corresponds
to 8.8% of all peers observed. Regarding peer reachability, the num-
bers of both reachable and unreachable peers are almost the same
most of the time, at around 15–16K. In other words, reachable and

unreachable peers occupy roughly half of the network each. Note
that unreachable peers include the unknown-IP peers discussed in
Section 5.1.
We further analyze the bandwidth capacity distribution of each
group: floodfill, reachable, and unreachable. As shown in Table 1,
while reachable and unreachable groups have a similar capacity
distribution to the whole network in which L-flagged type is the
most dominant and N-flagged type is the second, the floodfill group
has the N-flagged type as the most dominant, and the L-flagged type
comes second.
Note that the sum of all flags is not equal to 100% for two reasons:
(1) the fluctuation in the bandwidth of a peer can frequently change
its capacity flag, and (2) for backwards compatibility with older
software versions, a peer may publish more than one bandwidth
letter at the same time [34]. More specifically, P and X flags are
added since version 0.9.20, and they override the previous highest
bandwidth flag (O flag). In order for older versions of the I2P router
software to function normally, a peer with a P or an X flag also has
an O flag in its capacity field.
Within the floodfill group, the total percentage of P and X peers
is around 30%, greater than the percentage of L-flagged peers. The
result aligns with the fact that the floodfill mode is only enabled
automatically on peers that are configured with high bandwidth
limits. The current minimum requirement for a floodfill router is
128 KB/s of shared bandwidth. With the current rules for automatic
floodfill opt-in, a peer needs to have at least an N flag in order
to become a floodfill router automatically [34]. However, Table 1
shows that there is a group of floodfill routers with lower shared
bandwidth than required. This group includes K, L, and M-flagged

peers, which together comprise roughly 30% of all floodfill routers
observed. This contradiction is due to the fact that operators can
force their routers to operate in floodfill mode by manually turning
on this option in the router console. As a consequence, the qualified
floodfill routers are only routers with a sufficient shared bandwidth
to serve the netDb mechanism (i.e., N, O, P, and X-flagged routers).
Based on the above observation about floodfill routers, we deem
those K, L, and M-flagged floodfill routers to be manually enabled
and unqualified floodfill routers. We recompute the number of qual-
ified floodfill routers by combining the sets of N, O, P, X peers, and
removing any peers that overlap with the sets of K, L, M peers. Based
on this calculation, 71% of the total floodfill routers observed are
purely N, O, P, or X-flagged. Consequently, the number of qualified
floodfill routers should be 2700 × 0.71 = 1, 917 routers. However,
among these qualified floodfill routers, there are also high-profile
floodfill routers that are manually enabled like ours. Therefore,
the amount of floodfill routers that are automatically enabled after
meeting all of the “health” requirements must be less than 1,917
routers, which matches the estimated number (i.e. around 1,700)
given on the official I2P website as of April, 2018 [34].
According to independent observations by I2P developers on the
official I2P website, approximately 6% of the peers in the network
are floodfill routers [34], but not 8.8% as found above. We show
that this difference is the result of unqualified floodfill routers,
which are manually enabled and do not actually meet the minimum
bandwidth requirements. Based on the percentage of “automatic”
floodfill routers in the network (i.e., 6%), the population of I2P peers
is calculated as 1, 917 ÷ 0.06 = 31, 950, approximately. This result
strengthens our hypothesis and observation from Section 4.3, that
running 40 routers allowed us to observe around 32K peers in the
network. Evidently, we can conclude with confidence that using 20
routers one can monitor more than 95.5% of the I2P network.
5.3.2 Geographic Distribution. Next, we utilize the MaxMind Data-
base to map addresses of I2P peers to their autonomous system
number (ASN) and country. Since about half of the observed peers
are associated with more than one IP address, as discussed in Sec-
tion 5.2.2, we need a proper way to count the number of peers
residing in each ASN/country. For each peer associated with many
IP addresses, we resolve these IP addresses into ASNs and countries

side (the x axis corresponds to the AS number).
before counting them to avoid counting two different IP addresses
belonging to one peer. If two IP addresses of the same peer reside
in the same ASN/country, we count the peer only once. Otherwise,
each different IP is counted.

United States, Russia, England, France, Canada, and Australia oc-
cupy more than 40% of peers in the network. The United States tops
the list with roughly 28K peers. Except for New Zealand, all Five
Eyes countries [36] are in the top 10. This group of 20 countries
makes up more than 60% of the total number of peers observed,
while the rest is made up of peers from 205 other countries and
regions. Among 32 countries with poor Press Freedom scores (i.e.
