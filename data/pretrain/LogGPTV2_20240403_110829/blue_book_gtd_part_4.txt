Now that you know where do your inputs come from you need to think how do you want to manage them from now on to ensure that you're able to be able to continuously capture items in a frictionless way.
## Empty the inbox
Now that we have collected everything that has your attention, you need to get to the bottom of your inbox. To be able to do it in a reasonable amount of time you are not meant to actually do the items themselves, instead analyze each item and decide what it is, what it means and what are you going to do with it.
Follow the steps of [Clarify and organize](#clarify-and-organize) until you've reached the bottom of your inbox. You’ll dump a mess of things, file a bunch, do a lot of two-minute actions, and hand off a number of items to other people. You’ll also wind up with a stack of items that have actions associated with them that you still need to do soon, someday, or on a specific date, and reminders of things you’re waiting on from other people. Now that you have everything at the next action level, we need to scale up in the abstraction ladder so that we can prioritize better what to do next.
# Unclassified thoughts
* There must be zero resistance to using the systems we have. Having to continually reinvent our in-tray, our filing system, and how and where we process our stuff can only be a source of incessant distraction.
* One of the best tricks for enhancing your productivity is having organizing tools you love to use.
- Being organized means nothing more or less than where something is matches what it means to you.
- Your organisation system is not something that you'll create all at once. It will evolve as you process yuor stuff and test out whether you have put everything in the best place for you. It won't remain static, it will evolve as you do.
## The weekly review
The Weekly Review is the time to:
* Gather and process all your stuff.
* Review your system.
* Update your lists.
* Get clean, clear, current, and complete.
