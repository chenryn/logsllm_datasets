User: Using Google App Engine Memcache... Can more than one user access the same key-value pair?
or in other words.. Is there a Memcache created per user or is it shared across multiple users?
Assistant: Memcache is shared across users.  It is not a cookie, but exists in RAM on the server for all pertinent requests to access.
