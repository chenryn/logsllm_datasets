Question: A web application uses user input to construct file paths for accessing documents within a secure directory named 'securedocs'. The application has mechanisms in place to prevent direct access to this directory. However, a user discovered that inputting 'tempdocs/../securedocs/confidential.pdf' into the document retrieval feature results in unauthorized access to the file. Which of the following statements best describes the vulnerability that has been exploited?
"A": "The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing directory traversal via path manipulation.",
"B": "The application's encryption of 'securedocs' is compromised, allowing decryption of confidential.pdf without authorization.",
"C": "The application incorrectly implements file permissions, allowing any user to access files in 'securedocs'.",
"D": "The application has an open port that is being exploited to bypass the access restrictions to 'securedocs'."
Answer: A
