Question: As an administrator, you are configuring a fleet of macOS devices to enhance their security posture while allowing for certain operational flexibility. You need to modify the System Integrity Protection (SIP) settings to achieve the following objectives: 1) Permit the verification failures of the SSV volume root hash, 2) Ensure the kernel memory remains non-writable, and 3) Enforce the built-in allow list for boot-args NVRAM variable. Which of the following SIP fields would you modify?
"A": "Set sip1 to true to allow verification failures of the SSV volume root hash.",
"B": "Set sip2 to false to keep the Configurable Text Read-only Region (CTRR) hardware register locked, marking kernel memory as non-writable.",
"C": "Set sip3 to false to enforce the built-in allow list for the boot-args NVRAM variable.",
"D": "Set sip0 to a specific unsigned integer value that corresponds to disabling the enforcement of the built-in allow list for the boot-args NVRAM variable."
Answer: ABC
