To effectively implement CIS Control 6.3, which requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for externally-exposed applications, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Identify Externally-Exposed Applications**: Conduct a thorough inventory of all enterprise and third-party applications that are accessible from outside the organization's network. This includes web applications, remote access tools, and any other services that can be accessed over the internet.

2. **Assess MFA Support**: Evaluate each identified application to determine if it supports MFA. If an application does not natively support MFA, consider using a directory service or Single Sign-On (SSO) provider that can enforce MFA on behalf of the application.

3. **Implement MFA**: Enforce MFA for all externally-exposed applications where it is supported. This can typically be done through the application’s security settings or via a centralized SSO solution. Ensure that the MFA implementation aligns with the organization’s security policies and industry best practices.

4. **Configure Directory Service or SSO Provider**: If using a directory service or SSO provider, configure it to require MFA for all external access. This ensures that even if an application does not natively support MFA, the SSO provider will enforce it.

5. **User Education and Training**: Educate users on the importance of MFA and provide training on how to set up and use MFA. This helps to ensure compliance and reduces the risk of user resistance or errors.

6. **Monitor and Audit**: Regularly monitor and audit MFA usage to ensure that it is being enforced correctly and to identify any potential issues or gaps in security. This includes reviewing logs and conducting periodic security assessments.

CIS Control 6.3 focuses on the asset type "Users" and serves the security function of "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture and protect against unauthorized access to externally-exposed applications.
