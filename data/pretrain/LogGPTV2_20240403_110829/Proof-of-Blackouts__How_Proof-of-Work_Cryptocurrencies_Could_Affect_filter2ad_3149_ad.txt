through cease of medical care, water and other basic needs, large-scale blackouts
entail a much greater challenge. Most plant types actually need electric energy to
start up. Only very few power plants have black-start capabilities, i.e., a startup
procedure without external power. Afterwards, every other power plant has to be
brought up by synchronizing into that grid, while simultaneously reconnecting
an appropriate amount of household to keep an equilibrium of demand and

production. After the 2003 Northeast blackout, it took two days to bring most
households back on the grid; the remaining areas had to face up to two weeks
without electrical power [30].
In recent time, cryptocurrencies – their value, as well as their mining opera-
tions – have experienced extraordinary growth and this trend is likely to continue
in the near future, and possibly beyond. Thus, they will consume an increasing
share of the produced electricity. In the course of this work, we focused on Euro-
pean power grids, namely the UCTE, the NORDEL as well as various island net-
works as they are considered to be among the most reliable systems. At the same
time, miners are not predominantly present in these areas, but rather in other
networks. Despite these considerations, the results show that cryptocurrencies
might have a negative impact on reliable grid operation. Thus, any thresholds
determined for that networks will likely be lower on other less robust grids with
a higher mining ratio. For example, Venezuela, known for its continuous prob-
lems with power grid operation, has attributed blackouts purportedly to “illegal”
Bitcoin mining15.
Countermeasures: In conclusion, its worth to think about potential counter-
measures such as the following:
– Change of mining software behavior: An approach that could readily help
to mitigate the outlined attack is to update cryptocurrency mining software
such that it takes the problem of sudden load swings into consideration. For
instance, upon loss of connectivity or lack of work to be performed, mining
software could continue the mining process for a randomized amount of time
in order to reduce the overall power consumption more smoothly.
– Further eﬃciency increase: Mining hardware could be improved to reduce
their power consumption per hash rate even further, and counteract the rising
power consumption. Past growth rates however increased power consumption
at higher rates than savings due to more eﬃciency. In addition, improvements
in eﬃciency appear to be lower in the future as our trend analysis shows at
least for Bitcoin, see Fig. 2(a).
– Replacement of Proof-of-Work: There are currently several approaches to
replace Proof-of-Work with alternative, less energy intensive mechanisms.
Provably secure Proof-of-Stake designs have been proposed, where the
required resource to be able to participate in mining are the cryptocur-
rency units themselves [4,16,18]. Furthermore, by relying on trusted hardware,
systems employing Proof-of-Elapsed-Time (PoET) or Proof-of-Useful-Work
(PoUW) can be realized [37]. Finally, alternative limited resources, such as
disk space in the case of Proof-of-Space [26], may be utilized.
– Change of incentives: Each mining operator aims to expand its mining capa-
bility as long as they expect a net proﬁt in doing so. This increases the
network’s overall hash rate and power consumption; at the same time, the
diﬃculty of the network is adjusted making Proof-of-Work harder to leave

targeted block intervals unchanged. This implies that the cryptocurrency’s
throughput does not increase despite more eﬀort (and power) spent on min-
ing, i.e., it does not scale transaction numbers with the hash rate. Expanding
the incentives in a way that rewards more resource eﬃcient mining would not
only reduce hash rate but also power consumption.
– Regulation: Power grids are critical infrastructure; nation states aim to pro-
tect their infrastructure and take actions usually by means of legislation, e.g.,
Directive 2008/114/EC by the European Union. In consequence, governments
might regulate the use or mining of cryptocurrencies. For example, China has
already banned Bitcoin trading16, even though mining is still legal.
– Purchase of surplus production: Finally, there is also a beneﬁt for power
grid reliability with regard to cryptocurrencies. The latter could stabilize the
power grid, and purchase a surplus of energy production in order to main-
tain the balance between supply and consumption. This typically happens
in nights: Base load power stations, e.g., nuclear or coal power plants, suﬀer
from slow dynamics and therefore operators prefer paying others to consume
the power instead of reducing their plants’ output. Killing two birds with a
stone, miners would not only raise money through the mining reward and
transaction fees but would also raise income through power consumption.
However, mining equipment would not run 24/7 which impacts the return on
investment.
– Speed-up of power grid measures: In future, primary control could improve
responsiveness until full activation. As physical limits impose constraints on
power plant turbines due to their mass; grid operators might have to ﬁnd
alternative ways for primary control, e.g., by using power from electric cars’
batteries to stabilize the network.
9 Related Work
Large-scale power grid failures and destabilization incidents bringing grids to
their limits are rare events in European power grids. Nevertheless, operators
investigate and learn from these occurrences to be able to ensure more reliable
operation in the future, e.g., the November 2006 blackout, which split the power
grid into three synchronous zones due to cascading eﬀects [29], a blackout in
Turkey in 2015 [14], and inter-area oscillations [13]. Attacks against smart grids
are outlined in Mohsenian-Rad et al. [20] and Mishra et al. [19], where an adver-
sary manipulates messages, e.g., containing pricing information, causing smart
behavior to indirectly aﬀect the power grid, e.g., simultaneous charging of all
electric vehicles. As of today, smart grid functionality is not yet widely deployed.
Hence, the respective attack surface is low. On a smaller network scale Xu et
al. [36] investigate how power oversubscription in data centers could be used
to conduct concerted attacks that lead to undesired power outages. Finally, the
impact of dynamic load attacks on smart grid operation is outlined in Amini et
16 http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-ﬁnance/article/2132009/china-stamp-
out-cryptocurrency-trading-completely-ban.

al. [1], however the authors do not provide strategies how an adversary could gain
such a high amount of controllable load. This problem is overcome in Dabrowski
et al. [7], where it is shown that an adversary could form a botnet from com-
modity hardware as well as Internet-of-Thing devices to reach the necessary
controllable load for a successful attack. In addition, it is highlighted that an
adversary requires much lower amounts of controllable consumers than stated
in [1]. In regard to power consumption cryptocurrencies are investigated in a
twofold way: either for power eﬃciency of mining hardware or their total con-
sumption’s impact on the environment. Wang and Liu [34] consider the evolution
of miners, including their power consumption and productivity. O’Dwyer and
Malone [23] investigate the proﬁtability of Bitcoin mining, including hardware
characteristics as well as exchange rates, and bound the total power consump-
tion of Bitcoin to 3 GW. Further publications that provide estimates on the total
power consumption of Bitcoin are presented by Vranken [32], Deetman [8], and
The Vries [33]. We asses their models in Sect. 4; our work is based on Deetman’s
approach. Another estimation is published by Orman [24], however the numbers
appear erroneous, e.g., a total Bitcoin hash rate of 1018 Hashes/s.
10 Conclusion
By now, power consumption with regard to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
and Ethereum has been considered in a twofold way. Either, mining operators
have aimed to maximize revenue (and therefore invested in most eﬃcient mining
hardware), or ecologists criticize the cryptocurrencies’ massive amount of power
consumption and its adverse aﬀects on the environment. In the course of this
work, we broaden the discussion and investigate whether cryptocurrencies are
able to destabilize power grid operation by suddenly reducing mining (and thus
electric load). The latter might be achieved by the exploitation of a backdoor in
a vast number of miners, by compromising the communication infrastructure or
by malfunctionality of software required for mining – all events that have been
shown possible or have actually happened in the past.
Indeed, we identiﬁed potential that such incidents might negatively impact
power grid operation causing load shedding, the shutdown of power plants and
eventually large-scale blackouts, if not now then possibly in the near future. Our
results are based on European power grids, namely the UCTE, NORDEL and
various island networks, that are considered to be among the most reliable. At
the same time, these grids currently serve only a minor part of mining hardware.
In the UCTE network, the biggest synchronous power grid by total load, we see
power consumption of Bitcoin and Ethereum each reaching critical values within
the next years, assuming further growth of cryptocurrencies. Whereas, some less
stable grids are serving proportionally more mining facilities, and consequently
face higher risks from such incidents. Concluding, the current gold rush-like hype
towards cryptocurrencies may not only impact ﬁnance but also the real, physical
world. While we do not oppose cryptocurrencies in general, we view their ever
increasing power consumption with a critical eye. In this respect it is essential
202

to consider the possible consequences of uncontrolled growth and try to provide
eﬀective countermeasures that help to ensure the stable operation of power grids.
