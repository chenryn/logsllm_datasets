User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Remote Desktop Protocol as a remote control? I use rdp all the time - both for work and personal stuff.  For my personal stuff I want to be able to rdp into a machine and have the session continue to be accessible from the host machine.  For example:  In my home office I have my laptop (development machine) and my HomeServer which doubles as fileserver and workstation.  I rdp into the homeserver from the laptop, open pandora.com to play some music.  I want the music to play through the speakers of the HomeServer machine.  Basically I want the same behavior you get with LogMeIn or VNC.  Is this possible?

Assistant: Options > Play on remote computer

Don't log off, just disconnect the session (click on the X that appears when you hover your mouse at the top of the screen).
Disconnecting keeps all the info about your session in memory and is waiting for you the next time you log back in.



EDIT:
try mstsc /admin

the switch /console is ignored in RDC version 6.1
