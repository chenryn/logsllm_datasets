# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.175]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.2.1750.0
My font is `Input Mono`.
# Steps to reproduce
Open Windows Terminal, PowerShell with this profile (it's basically posh-git
and Chocolatey):
    # poshgit...
    Push-Location (Split-Path -Path $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition -Parent)
    # Load posh-git module from current directory
    Import-Module .\posh-git\posh-git
    # If module is installed in a default location ($env:PSModulePath),
    # use this instead (see about_Modules for more information):
    # Import-Module posh-git
    # Set up a simple prompt, adding the git prompt parts inside git repos
    function global:prompt {
        $realLASTEXITCODE = $LASTEXITCODE
        Write-Host($pwd.ProviderPath) -nonewline
        Write-VcsStatus
        $global:LASTEXITCODE = $realLASTEXITCODE
        return "> "
    }
    Pop-Location
    Start-SshAgent -Quiet
    # Chocolatey profile
    $ChocolateyProfile = "$env:ChocolateyInstall\helpers\chocolateyProfile.psm1"
    if (Test-Path($ChocolateyProfile)) {
      Import-Module "$ChocolateyProfile"
    }
    function semver { gitversion /output json /showvariable fullsemver }
    $env:Path += (";" + $PSScriptRoot)
  1. Go to a git folder (such that the posh-git prompt appears)
  2. Type a character
  3. Type another character
  4. Type yet another character (the suspense is killing me!)
# Expected behavior
The first two character stay as they were, and the third appears right next to
them.
# Actual behavior
The first two characters move to the left one position, and the third appears
next to them. I.e. any commands 3 characters or greater get shifted to the
left one position when the 3rd character is typed.
This occurs for any 3rd character, including spaces.
Have just found #635 ... it looks very similar but that talks about rendering
characters the wrong width? That doesn't seem to be the case here?
