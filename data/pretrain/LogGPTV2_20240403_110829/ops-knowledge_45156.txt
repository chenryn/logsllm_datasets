**Issue Description:**

- **Server:** AWS EC2
- **Operating System:** Amazon Linux
- **Python Version:** 2.7.10

When I run the following command, it works as expected:
```sh
$ pip --version
pip 7.1.2 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
```

However, when I use `sudo` with the same command, I encounter an error:
```sh
$ sudo pip --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 3020, in <module>
    working_set = WorkingSet._build_master()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 616, in _build_master
    return cls._build_from_requirements(__requires__)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 629, in _build_from_requirements
    dists = ws.resolve(reqs, Environment())
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 807, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: pip==6.1.1
```

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you can upgrade the version of `pip` that is used by `sudo` by running the following command:
```sh
sudo easy_install --upgrade pip
```

This command will update the `pip` version for the system-wide Python installation, ensuring that `sudo pip` works correctly.
