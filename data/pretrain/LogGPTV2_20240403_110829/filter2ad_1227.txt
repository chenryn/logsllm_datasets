ABSTRACT AND OVERVIEW 
The  workshop  on  “Attacks  and  Solutions  in  HardwarE 
Security” (ASHES) welcomes any theoretical and practical works 
attacks, 
on 
solutions, 
countermeasures,  proofs,  classification, 
formalization,  and 
implementations.    Besides  mainstream  research,  ASHES  puts 
some  focus  on  new  and  emerging  scenarios:    This  includes  the 
internet  of  things  (IoT),  nuclear  weapons  inspections,  arms 
control,  consumer  and  infrastructure  security,  or  supply  chain 
security, among others.  ASHES also welcomes dedicated works 
on special purpose hardware, such as lightweight, low-cost, and 
energy-efficient devices, or non-electronic security systems.  The 
workshop  hosts  four  different  paper  categories:    Apart  from 
regular and short papers, this includes works that systematize and 
structure  a  certain  (sub-)area  (so-called  “Systematization  of 
Knowledge” (SoK) papers), and so-termed “Wild and Crazy” (WaC) 
papers,  which  distribute  seminal  ideas  at  an  early  conceptual 
stage.  This summary gives a brief overview of the fourth edition 
of the workshop, which will take place virtually on November 13, 
2020, as a post-conference satellite workshop of ACM CCS.

As predicted by Gartner in 2015, there will be around 21 billion 
hardware  devices  connected  in  the  IoT  by  2020,  creating  a

spending of about 3,000 billion dollars per year.  This makes the 
IoT and associated hardware security questions clearly one of the 
most massive and impactful endeavors of this century.   
At the same time, the development of suitable hardware strategies 
seems  to  lag  behind  the  actual  spread  of  the  IoT.    While  the 
security  community  has  long  recognized  that  many  of  the 
established, classical recipes do not transfer easily (or not at all) 
to  hardware  in  an  IoT-setting,  no  fully  convincing  substitute 
strategies have been developed yet.   
This leads to a host of novel questions, which cannot be addressed 
by existing means and methods alone.  Particularly pressing issues 
in this context include: 
  How can we get individual cryptographic keys into 
billions of low-cost hardware devices? 
  How can we securely identify hardware over digital 
channels, including systems without digital signal 
processors or powered by scavenged energy? 
  How can we protect against tampering and side-
channels in hardware?  
  How can we remotely verify the functionality and 
integrity of connected IoT-devices? 
  How can we establish long-term confidentiality of 
communication by resource-constrained hardware? 
  How can we protect hardware against malware 
(viruses, Trojan horses, etc.) and network attacks? 
  How can we enable secure physical data storage, 
especially in highly connected, potentially lightweight 
hardware systems? 
  How can we preserve the privacy of users in connected 
systems and in pervasive IoT-scenarios? 
The  purpose  of  the  ASHES  workshop  is  to  foster  solutions  for 
these  and  other  impending  issues,  including  new  methods  and 
application scenarios, such as the IoT.   It shall provide the CCS-
community with a dedicated, specialized forum for all aspects of 
hardware  research.    While  covering  mainstream  hardware 
security  research,  it  tries  to  support  novel  approaches  and 
methods at an early stage, fostering innovation in the area.   The

In  2020,  there  were  25  submissions,  and  the  exact  number  of 
participants is yet open at the time of writing.  The workshop will 
be held virtually, and so will CCS.  From the 25 submissions, 11 
papers  were  selected  for  presentation  (44%  acceptance  rate),  
among  them  two  SoC  and  one  WaC  paper.    Out  of  the  25 
submissions, 12 came from the US, 7 from Europe, 5 from India, 
and one from Japan. 
4  PROGRAM 
The  program  will  host  eleven  technical  papers  distributed  over 
four sessions.  These sessions are:   
Physically Unclonable Functions and Beyond 
Side Channels: Attacks and Defenses 
Fault Attacks and Cryptographic Hardware Design 
  Hardware and System Security 
In addition, there will be two invited keynotes at the workshop.

3  WORKSHOP STATISTICS  
In its first year 2017 in Dallas, Texas, USA, ASHES enjoyed 20 
submissions  and  37  registered  participants.    Geographically, 
submissions  came  mostly  from  institutions  in  the  US&Canada 
(10), followed by Europe (6), Asia (2), India (1) and Australia (1).  6 
papers were eventually accepted, equaling an acceptance rate of 
30%. 
In 2018 in Toronto, Canada, ASHES collected 30 submissions, 
and  45  persons  registered  for  the  workshop.    Geographically, 
submissions  came  again  mostly  from  authors  associated  with 
institutions in the US and Canada (17), followed by Europe (12) 
and  India  (1).    10  submissions  were  eventually  accepted, 
constituting a 33.3% acceptance rate.   
In  2019  in  London,  UK,  there  were  36  submissions  to  the 
workshop, and 107 registered participants.  Presumably due to the 
European location, 17 ASHES submissions came from Europe in 
that year, closely followed by the US and Canada (15), and Asia 
(3)  and India  (1).   The  workshop eventually  hosted  11  accepted 
papers (amounting to a 30.6% acceptance rate).
