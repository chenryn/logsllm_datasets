Address Allocation: We utilized the visualization technique introduced by
Foremski et al. [8] to analyze our dataset. To do so, we created the set of all
unique IPv6 address records we obtained over all measurements. The respective
results are depicted in Fig. 3: the least signiﬁcant nibbles are relatively evenly
distributed, which aligns with our observation that zones are either very random
or in some form sequential.
Fortunately, the technique by Foremski et al. [8] also allows us to validate
our dataset. Speciﬁcally, Fig. 3(b) has been created over an earlier dataset that
we collected where an unexpected summation of the value d in IPv6 addresses
between the 64th and 96th bit appears. A closer investigation revealed that this
artifact was caused by a US-based educational institution that uses their PRE-
FIX:dddd:dddd::/96 allocation for their DHCPv6 Wi-Fi access networks. As
aforementioned, this dynamically-generated network was not detected due to
the step-sizes in Algorithm 2, which is why we excluded it manually, see Sect. 4.
Further work should evaluate 4 nibble wide steps, as proposed earlier in this
paper.

6 Case-Study
Following, we present how ﬁndings of our technique can be used to obtain in-
depth insights into practical issues. We provide a brief analysis of the IPv6 eﬀorts
in the internal infrastructure of a large SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) cloud plat-
form operator. For our investigation, we selected the preﬁxes of this operator
based on its IPv6 announcements collected via bgp.he.net. To obtain further
ground-truth, we also collected the PTR records for all IPv4 preﬁxes announced
by the operator’s autonomous system (AS) from bgp.he.net. We took two mea-
surements, T1 and T2, two weeks apart in September 2016. Figure 4 shows
an overview of the allocation policy of the operator. Speciﬁcally, the opera-
tor uses three /32 preﬁxes, with one being used per region she operates in (see
Fig. 4(a)). In each region, the operator splits her preﬁx via the 40th to 44th bit of
addresses. IPv6 networks used by network-edge equipment for interconnectivity
links between diﬀerent regions are distinguished by an 8 at the 48th to 51st bit,
instead of 0, which is used by all other preﬁxes.

Fig. 4. Overview of address allocation in the SaaS cloud provider’s network.
Another interesting part of the addressing policy are the /48 networks the
SaaS provider allocates. Here, we can see that networks are linearly assigned,
starting with PREFIX:0000-::-/48 , thus creating pools of /64s for various pur-
poses. Furthermore, with /48s being linearly assigned, we discover that preﬁxes
with higher indexes have not yet been assigned. The same assignment policy
holds for hosts in /64s networks, as indicated by the distribution over the three
least signiﬁcant nibbles used in addresses.
A third aspect of the operator’s assignment policy is documented in Fig. 4(b).
Speciﬁcally, the boxplots show the number of hosts per /64 preﬁx in the operators
networks. For both measurements, we only observe two /64 preﬁxes with signiﬁ-
cantly more than 250 hosts. A closer investigation of these networks reveals that
they are related to internal backbone and ﬁrewalling services spanning multiple
Points-of-Presence, following the PTR naming schemes of the obtained records.
Apart from this change, we do see a slight increase in the number of hosts per
network in the median, but not the mean. An interesting side-note is that the
IPv6 PTR records appear manually allocated by the operator’s network staﬀ.
Collecting Global IPv6 Datasets From DNS
41
We do arrive at this conclusion because we encountered various records with
typographical errors in them.
Comparing of the datasets with the corresponding IPv4 PTR sets, we note
that the diversity of records is far higher in the IPv4 set. There, various second-
level domains can be found mixed together, which we did not encounter for the
IPv6 set. Various naming schemes for infrastructure hosts are also present. For
example, we discover that the customer-facing domain of the operator is being
used for infrastructure services. However, it has apparently been disbanded with
the growth of the organization, as we also discover infrastructure speciﬁc second-
level domains. For the IPv6 set we only observe one infrastructure domain. In
general, naming is far more consistent for IPv6. Our conjecture is that the
operator made an eﬀort in keeping a consistent state when ﬁnally rolling out
IPv6, while IPv4 is suﬀering from legacy setups introduced during the com-
pany’s growth. The last striking observation is that the PTR records returned
for IPv4 and IPv6 reverse pointers do not resolve to valid A and AAAA records
themselves. A direct consequence is that, for this network operator, the technique
proposed by Czyz et al. [5] is not applicable. We conjecture that the operator
chose this setup because she does not require forward lookups, yet wants tracer-
outes and other reverse-lookup related tools, especially distributed logging, to
show the FQDNs.
7 Conclusion
We introduce a novel methodology to collect a large IPv6 dataset from exclu-
sively public data sources. Our initial evaluation of the methodology demon-
strates its practical applicability. Requiring no access to a speciﬁc network van-
tage point, we were able to collect more than 5.8 million allocated IPv6 addresses,
of which 5.4 million addresses were found in just three days by issuing 221 million
DNS queries. Speciﬁcally, our technique discovered one allocated IPv6 address
per only 41 DNS queries on average. With the obtained dataset, we were able
to provide an in-depth look into the data-centers of a large cloud provider. By
comparing our results with the corresponding IPv4 reverse entries, we demon-
strate that our technique can discover systems which would have been missed by
previous proposals for collecting IPv6 addresses [5]. In summary, our technique
is an important tool for tracking the ongoing deployment of IPv6 on the Inter-
net. We provide our toolchain to researchers as free software at: https://gitlab.
inet.tu-berlin.de/ptr6scan/toolchain.
We note that our technique can also be applied to E.164 records (Telephone
Numbers in DNS), but leave this for future work. Furthermore, future work
should utilize this technique over a period of time in order to obtain a progressing
view on IPv6 deployment on the Internet. To increase coverage, additional seeds
and other address collection techniques should be integrated. This extension of
our work should be combined with security scanning as it is already done for
IPv4 [19]. Following the ﬁndings of Czyz et al. [5], such projects are direly needed
to increase overall security on the Internet.
