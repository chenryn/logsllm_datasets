# IPv6 Address Allocation and Dataset Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This document presents a detailed analysis of IPv6 address allocation and the collection of large IPv6 datasets from public data sources. The methodology introduced here allows for the discovery of allocated IPv6 addresses, providing valuable insights into the deployment and usage patterns of IPv6 in large cloud platforms.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Visualization Technique
We utilized the visualization technique introduced by Foremski et al. [8] to analyze our dataset. This involved creating a set of all unique IPv6 address records obtained from our measurements. The results are depicted in Figure 3, where the least significant nibbles (4-bit segments) are relatively evenly distributed, indicating that zones are either very random or sequential.

### 2.2 Validation of the Dataset
The visualization technique also allowed us to validate our dataset. Figure 3(b) shows an artifact from an earlier dataset, which was caused by a US-based educational institution using their `PREFIX:dddd:dddd::/96` allocation for DHCPv6 Wi-Fi access networks. This dynamically-generated network was not detected due to the step-sizes in Algorithm 2, and we excluded it manually. Future work should evaluate 4-nibble wide steps as proposed in this paper.

## 3. Case Study: SaaS Cloud Platform Operator
### 3.1 Overview
We analyzed the IPv6 efforts in the internal infrastructure of a large SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) cloud platform operator. We selected the prefixes based on the operator's IPv6 announcements collected via `bgp.he.net`. Additionally, we collected PTR records for all IPv4 prefixes announced by the operator’s autonomous system (AS).

### 3.2 Measurement and Results
We took two measurements, T1 and T2, two weeks apart in September 2016. Figure 4 provides an overview of the allocation policy:
- **Prefix Usage**: The operator uses three `/32` prefixes, one per region. Each region splits its prefix via the 40th to 44th bits.
- **Network Distinguishing**: Networks used by network-edge equipment for interconnectivity links between different regions are distinguished by an 8 at the 48th to 51st bit, while other prefixes use 0.
- **Address Assignment**: `/48` networks are linearly assigned, starting with `PREFIX:0000-::-/48`, creating pools of `/64` for various purposes. Higher-indexed prefixes have not yet been assigned.
- **Host Distribution**: Boxplots in Figure 4(b) show the number of hosts per `/64` prefix. Two `/64` prefixes had significantly more than 250 hosts, related to internal backbone and fire-walling services.

### 3.3 PTR Record Analysis
- **Manual Allocation**: IPv6 PTR records appear to be manually allocated, as evidenced by typographical errors.
- **Diversity Comparison**: The diversity of records is higher in the IPv4 set, with various second-level domains mixed together. For IPv6, only one infrastructure domain was observed, indicating more consistent naming.
- **Forward Lookups**: PTR records for both IPv4 and IPv6 reverse pointers do not resolve to valid A and AAAA records, suggesting that the operator does not require forward lookups but wants traceroutes and other reverse-lookup tools to show FQDNs.

## 4. Conclusion
We introduced a novel methodology to collect a large IPv6 dataset from exclusively public data sources. Our evaluation demonstrates its practical applicability, requiring no access to a specific network vantage point. We were able to collect over 5.8 million allocated IPv6 addresses, discovering one allocated address per 41 DNS queries on average. Our technique can discover systems missed by previous proposals, making it an important tool for tracking IPv6 deployment on the Internet.
