Phones that CCCP aims to primarily address.
Crypto Phones checksum validation also involves the second
optional task of Speaker Verification (to defeat voice MITM). How-
ever, manual speech perception and recognition is a complex task
[54]. Therefore, Speaker Verification is challenging even in benign
settings. On top of that, voice conversion and reordering attacks are
possible against Crypto Phones, which make Speaker Verification
even harder [58].
The results of prior studies show that current designs of Crypto
Phones offer a weak level of security (significantly weaker than
that guaranteed by the underlying protocols), and their usability
is low. Quantitatively, the overall average likelihood of users fail-
ing to detect an attack session is about 25-50%, while the average
likelihood of accepting a legitimate session is about 75% [58, 59].
These drawbacks with the currently deployed approach in Crypto
Phones provide a sound motivation to investigate other checksum
validation models.
Problem 2—Security Degradation with Increase in Check-
sum Size: Checksum size is a crucial security parameter for Crypto
Phones. Theoretically, the security of Crypto Phones should in-
crease exponentially in presence of a data MITM attacker with
increase in the checksum size.
However, [59] shows that increasing the checksum size makes
the Checksum Comparison task more difficult for human users,
eventually decreasing the usability and the security of the system.
Based on this prior study, while the theory guarantees that increas-
ing the checksum size, from 2-word to 4-word increases the security
exponentially, by a factor of 65536 (216), the attacker success prob-
ability increased (from about 30% to 40%). This situation emerges
because, as the checksums became longer, Checksum Comparison
became much harder.
In this light, there is a need to design new validation models,
which preserve the increase in system security with increase in
checksum size, to be consistent with the theoretical bounds of the
protocols.
3 OUR APPROACH: CLOSED CAPTION
CRYPTO PHONES
We introduce a novel Crypto Phone checksum validation design,
with the goal of making the Checksum Comparison and Speaker
Verification tasks highly robust (significantly more robust compared
to the traditional design). The introduced CCCP model (Figure 2)
is built using the speech transcription technology, and carefully
leverages the strengths of both humans and machines.
Transcription Primer: Automated Checksum Comparison in our
suggested schemes is based on a Speech to Text (STT) tool. STT,
which we also refer to as transcriber, takes the voice waveform as
input and recognizes it based on the best matching combination of
words. STT tools use machine learning techniques to incorporate
information about grammar and language structure to generate a
transcription. First, it gets a feature vector of each word and then
uses models to match this feature vector with the most probable fea-
ture vector in the model. Transcription is a fairly mature technology
with extensive applications in various domains involving human

other user (i.e., “voice conversion attack”) into the communication,
attempting to fool the user into accepting the speaker as valid. In
the different speaker attack, the adversary does not perform any
voice synthesis, while in the voice conversion attack the adversary
transforms his voice into the victim’s voice based on some prior
recordings of the victim’s voice.
Data MITM is the most straight-forward and hence a common
form of attack in practice, as Figure 5 shows. Compared to data
MITM attack, voice MITM attack is more complex to establish.
Firstly, it involves manipulation of both voice and data channels.
Secondly, it imposes a delay to look up the checksum in the audio
stream, to drop the legitimate checksum, and to insert an imitated
checksum [58]. Lastly, in the case of the voice conversion attack, it
requires training of the voice conversion tool based on previously
collected audio samples spoken by the victims. Collecting the sam-
ples in victim’s voice may not always be easy or possible. Clearly,
a different speaker attack is simpler than a voice conversion attack
since the attacker does not need to collect voice samples and train
the voice converter, but can easily use his/her voice 2.
Given the hierarchy of the threat model, as a mandatory goal,
real-world Crypto Phones implementations must attempt to make
data MITM attacks as difficult (or infeasible) as possible. Option-
ally, it may attempt to resist voice MITM attacks. Indeed, most
current Crypto Phones only ask the users to perform the Checksum
Comparison task to detect data MITM attacks [34, 64], and do not
explicitly ask the users to perform the Speaker Verification task
to detect voice MITM attacks. Among this class of attacks, differ-
ent speaker attack should be considered a more practical threat
followed by conversion attack, which is the most powerful attack.
This same tiered threat model is what we consider in this paper.
2.2 Limitations of Related Work
Problem 1—Susceptibility to Human Errors and MITM At-
tacks: Crypto Phones checksum validation protocol involves the
essential task of Checksum Comparison (to defeat data MITM).
However, it has been shown that the errors committed by hu-
man users in comparing the checksums lead to false acceptance
of an MITM attack session or false rejection of a valid checksum
2In practice, it is often assumed that the voice MITM attack is very difficult to perform
[34, 64], and therefore, traditional Crypto Phones usually do not explicitly ask the user
to perform the task of Speaker Verification.

push towards achieving a nearly negligible probability of success
for the data MITM attacker.
In addition to enhancing security against the data MITM attack,
CCCP promises to improve usability by taking the human user out
of the loop of the Checksum Comparison task, except for verbally
announcing the checksum, and thus, reduces the chances of false
negatives (i.e., disconnecting valid calls).
As part of CCCP, we build a Checksum Comparison tool suitable
for our purpose, based on the off-the-shelf transcription systems.
The current transcription technology [42] is known to be robust
and is in wide use as discussed above (primer), and thus we hope to
have excellent accuracy in the Checksum Comparison task based on
the transcription systems, thereby offering a high level of resistance
to data MITM attack.
Optionally Increasing the Robustness of Speaker Verifica-
tion through Single-Tasking: To optionally resist against voice
MITM, similar to current Crypto Phones, CCCP relies on the human
user to verify the speaker and judge if the received checksum is
spoken by the original speaker. In particular, the user should decide
if the voice that speaks the checksum belongs to the person he/she
is calling, either based on pre-familiarity with the speaker, or, if the
speaker is not already familiar, by assuring that the person who
speaks the checksum is the one who takes part in the rest of the
conversation [34].
However, there is a crucial difference between traditional Crypto
Phones and CCCP in Speaker Verification. Relieving the user from
the task of Checksum Comparison (through transcription as de-
scribed above), may improve the overall performance of the user
since the user is now only involved in a “single task” of Speaker
Verification. Therefore, by automating the Checksum Comparison,
we may also improve the performance of Speaker Verification under
benign and voice MITM attack settings. In contrast, current Crypto
Phones require the user to “multi-task”, which could be detrimental
to users’ performance [46–48, 51].
Our hypothesis is that in CCCP, original and different speakers
will be reasonably well-recognized, and even the converted voice
samples will be fairly recognized.
Summary of Projected Advantages of CCCP: Based on the
above discussion, CCCP could significantly improve the security
and usability of the traditional design. Figure 6 illustrates how
CCCP strives to increase security and usability of Crypto Phones,
as a direct or indirect result of automating Checksum Comparison,
the use of longer checksums, and single-tasking. We summarize the
advantages of our scheme (CCCP) compared to the current scheme
(traditional Crypto Phones) in Table 1.
4 CCCP EVALUATION STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Objectives
Our study is designed to measure the security and usability of
CCCP, based on the threat model depicted in Figure 5. The goals of
the studies are outlined below.
(1) Robustness against Data and Voice MITM Attacks: For se-
curity assessment against the data MITM attack, we are in-
terested in determining how often the transcriber accepts a

speech, including closed captioning of videos [10], journalism, and
medical transcription [23].
There are several open-source transcription tools available for
different platforms. These tools are designed for general use, hence
they incorporate the language model and optionally the speaker
model to improve the accuracy of the transcription. They also bene-
fit from signal processing algorithms, neural networks, deep learn-
ing, and big data to provide high accuracy. There are built-in Speech
to Text tools for dictation, voice commands and accessibility on
smartphones (e.g., Siri on iPhone [8] and “Ok Google” command en-
gine on Android phones [32]). Other apps, such as Nuance Dragon
Mobile Assistant [13], are also available and are gaining popularity.
These tools and apps are built on top of powerful Speech to Text
APIs, such as iOS Speech Recognition API [7], android.speech [6],
and Dragon NaturallySpeaking [14]. Other systems such as IBM
Watson Speech to Text [29] and Google Cloud Speech API [17] are
available for cloud and web platforms.
Increasing the Robustness of Checksum Comparison
through Transcription: Our key idea in CCCP is to automate the
process of Checksum Comparison by using the automated human
speech transcription technology. We propose to place automated
checksum comparison tool in the Crypto Phones, which receives
the audio checksum from one end (Alice’s checksum referred to as
SASA in Figure 2), and transcribes it at the other end (Bob) followed
by comparing the transcribed output with the local checksum
(Bob’s checksum referred to as SASB in Figure 2). Alice only needs
to verbally announce the checksum (like in current Crypto Phones)
but does not need to compare the checksum (unlike current Crypto
Phones). To initiate the transcription process, similar to speech
recognition systems, CCCP can spot a specific keyword (e.g., “Go
Secure”). Alternatively, tapping a “checksum matching” button
embedded within the UI could trigger the transcriber.
An indirect advantage of using the transcription technology is
the capability to use long checksums since Checksum Comparison
is being performed by a machine, not a human. To recall, the longer
the checksum, the better the theoretical security offered by the
