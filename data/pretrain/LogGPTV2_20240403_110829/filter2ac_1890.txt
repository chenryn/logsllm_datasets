When I left the service and the NSA, I was offered a job that seemed WAY too good to be true. Turns out it was. This talk will discuss how I came to work on the UAE's Project Raven, what signs I missed because I was being naive, and how other transitioning intelligence personnel can avoid making the same mistake.Project Raven is discussed in episode 47 on Darknet Diaries, has been reported about extensively by Chris Bing at Reuters and Nicole Perloth in her book "This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends".
