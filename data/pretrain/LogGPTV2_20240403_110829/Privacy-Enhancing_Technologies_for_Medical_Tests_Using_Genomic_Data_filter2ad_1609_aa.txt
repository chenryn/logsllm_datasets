Abstract—We propose privacy-enhancing technologies for med-
ical
tests and personalized medicine methods, which utilize pa-
tients’ genomic data. Focusing speciﬁcally on a typical disease-
susceptibility test, we develop a new architecture (between the patient
and the medical unit) and propose a privacy-preserving algorithm
by utilizing homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption.
Assuming the whole genome sequencing is done by a certiﬁed
institution, we propose to store patients’ genomic data encrypted
by their public keys at a Storage and Processing Unit (SPU). The
proposed algorithm lets the SPU process the encrypted genomic
data for medical tests and personalized medicine methods while
preserving the privacy of patients’ genomic data. Furthermore, we
implement and show via a complexity analysis the practicality of
the proposed scheme.
I. INTRODUCTION
As a result of the rapid evolution in genomic research,
substantial progress is expected in terms of improved diag-
nosis and better preventive medicine. However, the impact on
privacy is unprecedented, because (i) genetic diseases can be
unveiled, (ii) the propensity to develop speciﬁc diseases (such
as Alzheimer’s) can be revealed, (iii) a volunteer accepting
to have his genomic code made public can leak substantial
information about his ethnic heritage and genomic data of
his relatives (possibly against their will), and (iv) complex
privacy issues can arise if DNA analysis is used for criminal
investigations and insurance purposes. Such issues could lead
to genetic discrimination. Even though the Genetic Information
Non-discrimination Act (GINA), which prohibits the use of
genomic information in health insurance and employment,
attempted to solve some of these problems in the US, these
types of laws are very difﬁcult to enforce.
Due to the sensitivity of genomic data, research on the pri-
vacy of genomic data has considerably accelerated over the past
few years. In [1], Troncoso-Pastoriza et al. propose a protocol
for string searching, which is then extended by Blanton and
Aliasgari [2]. To compute the similarity of DNA sequences,
in [3], Jha et al. propose techniques for privately computing
the edit distance of two strings by using garbled circuits. In [4],
Bruekers et al. propose privacy-enhanced comparison of DNA
proﬁles for identity, paternity and ancestry tests using homo-
morphic encryption. In [5], Kantarcioglu et al. propose using
homomorphic encryption to perform scientiﬁc investigations
on integrated genomic data. In one of the recent works [6],
Baldi et al. make use of both medical and cryptographic tools
for privacy-preserving paternity tests, personalized medicine,
and genetic compatibility tests. Finally, instead of utilizing
public key encryption protocols, in [7], Canim et al. propose
securing the biomedical data using cryptographic hardware.
As a consequence of our extensive collaboration with ge-
neticists, clinicians, and biologists, we conclude that DNA
string comparison is insufﬁcient in many medical tests (that
use genomic data) and would not be enough to pave the
way to personalized medicine. As it will become clearer in
the next sections, speciﬁc variants (i.e., nucleotides which
reside at particular positions in the genome and vary between
individuals) must be considered individually for each genetic
test. Thus, as opposed to the aforementioned private string
search and comparison techniques, which focus on privately
comparing the distance between the genomic sequences, we
use the individual variants of the users to conduct genetic
disease susceptibility tests and develop personalized medicine
methods. Therefore, in this work, our goal is to protect the
privacy of users’ genomic data while enabling medical units
to access the genomic data in order to conduct medical tests
or develop personalized medicine methods.1 In a medical test,
a medical center checks for different health risks (e.g., disease
susceptibilities) of a user by using speciﬁc parts of his genome.
Similarly, to provide personalized medicine, a pharmaceutical
company tests the compatibility of a user on a particular
medicine, or a pharmacist checks the compatibility of a given
medicine (e.g., over-the-counter drug) to a given user. In both
scenarios, in order to preserve his privacy, the user does not
want to reveal his complete genome to the medical center or to
the pharmaceutical company. To achieve this goal, we propose
to store the genomic data at a Storage and Processing Unit
(SPU) and conduct the computations on genomic data utilizing
homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption to preserve
the privacy of the genomic data.
II. PRIVACY- PRESERVING MEDICAL TESTS AND
PERSONALIZED MEDICINE METHODS
Most medical tests and personalized medicine methods (that
use genomic data) involve a patient and a medical unit. In
general, the medical unit is the family doctor, a physician, a
pharmacist, or a medical council. In this study, we consider
a malicious medical unit as the potential attacker. That is, a
medical unit can be a malicious institution trying to obtain
private information about a patient. Even if the medical unit
is non-malicious, it is extremely difﬁcult for medical units
to protect themselves against the misdeeds of a hacker or
a disgruntled employee. Similarly, the genomic data is too
sensitive to be stored on users’ personal devices (mostly due
to security, availability, and storage issues), hence it is risky
to leave the users’ genomic data in their own hands. Thus, we
believe that a Storage and Processing Unit (SPU) should be
used to store and process the genomic data. We note that a
private company (e.g., cloud storage service), the government,
or a non-proﬁt organization could play the role of the SPU. We
assume that the SPU is an honest organization, but it might be
curious (e.g., existence of a curious party at the SPU), hence
genomic data should be stored at the SPU in encrypted form.
1An extended version of this work is available in [8].
We also assume the SPU does not have access to the real
identities of the patients and data is stored at the SPU by using
pseudonyms; this way, the SPU cannot associate the conducted
genomic tests to the real identities of the patients.
For the simplicity of presentation, in the rest of this work,
we will focus on a particular medical test (namely, computing
genetic disease susceptibility). We note that similar techniques
would apply for other medical tests and personalized medicine
methods. In a typical disease-susceptibility test, a medical
center (MC) wants to check the susceptibility of a patient (P)
to a particular disease X (i.e., probability that the patient P
will develop disease X). It is shown that a genetic disease-
susceptibility test can be realized by analyzing particular Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of the patient via some
operations [9], [10]. A SNP is a position in the genome holding
a nucleotide (A, T, C or G), which varies between individuals.
Each SNP contributes to the susceptibility in a different amount
and the contribution amount of each SNP is determined by
previous studies on case and control groups.
In general, there are two alleles (nucleotides) observed at a
given SNP position: (i) The major allele is the most frequently
observed nucleotide, and (ii) the minor allele is the rare
nucleotide. Everyone inherits one allele of every SNP position
from each of his parents. If an individual receives the same
minor allele from both parents, he is said to have a homozygous
variant for that SNP position. If, however, he inherits a different
allele from each parent (one minor and one major), he has
a heterozygous variant. There are approximately 40 million
approved SNPs in the human population as of now (according
to the NCBI dbSNP [11]) and each patient carries on average
4 million SNPs (i.e., homozygous or heterozygous variants)
out of this 40 million. Moreover, this set of 4 million SNPs is
different for each patient. From now on, to avoid confusion,
for each patient, we refer to these 4 million variants as the real
SNPs and the remaining non-variants (approved SNPs that do
not exist for the considered patient) as the potential SNPs of
the patient; when we only say “SNPs”, we mean both the real
and potential SNPs. In the rest of this work, for simplicity of
the presentation, we do not consider the type of the variant at
a real SNP position (i.e., whether the variation is homozygous
or heterozygous for that real SNP); we only consider whether
the patient has a real SNP or not at a particular position.
A. Proposed Solution
i and SNPP
the state of SNPi at
the patient P is
We assume that
represented as SNPP
i = 1, if P has a real SNP (i.e.,
variant) at this position, and SNPP
i = 0, if P does not have a
variant at this position. We let ΥP be the set of real SNPs of the
patient P (at which SNPP
i = 1). We also let ΩP represent the
set of potential SNPs (at which SNPP
i = 0). As the positions of
the SNPs are stored in plaintext, if the SPU only stores the real
SNPs in ΥP , a curious party at the SPU can learn all real SNP
positions of the patient, and hence, much about his genomic
sequence. Therefore, the SPU stores the states of both real and
potential SNP positions (in {ΥP ∪ ΩP }) in order to preserve
the privacy of the patient. Below, we summarize the proposed
approach for the privacy protecting disease-susceptibility test.
This approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.
• Step 0: The Cryptographic keys (public and secret keys) of
each patient are generated and distributed to the patients during
the initialization period. Then, symmetric keys are established
between the parties, using which the communication between
the parties is protected from an eavesdropper. We note that the
