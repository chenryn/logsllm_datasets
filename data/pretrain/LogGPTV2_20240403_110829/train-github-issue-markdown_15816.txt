As discussed in Google Groups
I have a task that imports a db file into mysql but it fails the second time I
re-run the playbook.
In order to overcome the failure I need to login to the mysql server and drop
the database in order to import successfully in the second play, this is not
possible in a production environment and doesn't make my code idempotent.
Using the ignore_errors I still get the same problem causing Ansible to stop
the execution on the next play and exit .
### Task :
        - name: import DB
          mysql_db: login_host={{ DB_ADDRESS }} login_user={{ DB_MASTER_USERNAME }} login_password={{ DB_MASTER_PASSWORD }} name=mmdb state=import target=roles/mmdb/templates/mmdb-init-tables.sql.j2
          ignore_errors: yes
### Error message
    failed: [localhost] => {"failed": true}
    msg: ERROR 1062 (23000) at line 4: Duplicate entry 'CM' for key 'PRIMARY'
### Ansible version
    ansible 1.4 (devel 6008ea40ee) last updated 2013/11/12 12:34:58 (GMT +000)
In other tasks the "ignore_errors: yes" works just fine but that doesn't seem
to be the case for an import failure using the mysql_db module.
