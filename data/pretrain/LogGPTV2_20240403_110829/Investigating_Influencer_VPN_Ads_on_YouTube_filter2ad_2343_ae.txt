labeled as “politics” and “society.” Tunnelbear frequently
sponsored chocoTaco [132], a gaming channel.
What do different companies’ ads say?
Most VPN
companies’ ads cover a wide variety of themes (Figure 7).
At a high-level, more than 30% of all VPN ads for NordVPN,
ExpressVPN, and SurfShark include statements about broad
guarantees, technical features, threats, and accessing content
all in the same ad. These three companies’ ads are also the only
ones to mention protecting passwords or ﬁnancial information.
On the other hand, we classiﬁed no Tunnelbear or Virtual-
Shield VPN ad statements as relating to access to more con-
tent. In contrast, SurfShark VPN ads has the highest ratio (23
of 26) of videos mentioning accessing content. This dichotomy
may relate to the arms race between content companies and
VPN companies, in which some VPN companies are doing
better than others [136].
VirtualShield has the highest rate of overpromises or ex-
aggerations (18 of 33 videos). It also has the highest rate of
threat statements, by a slim margin (31 of 33 videos).
More speciﬁcally (Figure 8 in Appendix § A), mentions
of VPN interactions with location and IPs are widespread.
Similarly, threat statements often use vague adversaries and
hackers. For example, more than half of ExpressVPN ads
contain at least one hacker or vague adversary statement.
Interestingly, VirtualShield is most likely to mention the
government, as well as data companies or just unspeciﬁed

companies, as adversaries. Further, VirtualShield ads least
frequently mention encryption and rerouting. This might imply
a focus on threats rather than features. In line with high-level
trends, Tunnelbear generally lacks details.
In our dataset, NordVPN and ExpressVPN talk about ﬁ-
nancial risk, while ShurfShark ads are most likely to feature
resilience against credential theft.
When we look at themes over time (Figure 5), content-
related VPN ads ﬁrst appear during mid-2018 and reach their
highest point during mid-2020. This may relate to increased
ads for SurfShark (with the highest ratio of content ads) and
potentially to COVID-19. One YouTuber said, “Now that so
many of us are stuck at home, it’s only a matter of time before
you run out of stuff to watch on Netﬂix. . . . think about all the
Netﬂix libraries you can go through” [137].
We also note a spike in overpromises or exaggerations in
October 2018, primarily related to VirtualShield (with the
highest ratio of such ads).
Other content, such as technical claims and broad guaran-
tees, appears consistent among VPN companies and over time.
F. Advertising techniques
As expected, VPN ads usually contain language and tech-
niques that are common in advertisements.
Disclosure
FTC guidelines instruct video content creators
that “disclosure should be in the video and not just in the
description uploaded with the video,” and suggest the disclo-
sure should be both visual and auditory [13]. However, prior
research troublingly suggests that there are many undisclosed
advertiser/company relationships on YouTube [12]. We there-
fore noted what type of disclosures, if any, YouTubers made.
We found that although 188 videos (59.4M views) have
disclosures at least somewhat compliant with regulatory guide-
lines [13], a large minority (55 videos, 3.3M views) do not.
To comply, a number of videos both display text and play
audio declaring the relationship with a VPN company (52

886
videos, 30.0M views). Most, however, disclose either only
via audio (130 videos, 28.6M views) or only through visual
elements (6 videos, 811K views). Fifty of the videos that
contain visual disclosure (29.7M views) use YouTube’s native
disclosure UI [138].
In violation of the guidelines, 13 videos (1.5M views) only
disclose afﬁliation with VPN companies in the description.
Further, 42 (1.8M views) include afﬁliate links without ex-
plicitly disclosing at all. For example, one 73-second ad is
never explicitly disclosed [104].
Comparison to other products
YouTubers frequently
promote VPNs by comparing them to other products. Many
simply claim the VPN they are promoting is the best VPN
(41 videos, 9.0M). Some accurately [9] warn that free or very
cheap VPNs can harm security and privacy (3 videos, 34.2K
views), and a few directly name competitors when claiming
superiority (e.g.,[139]; (4 videos, 359K views). A minority
also compare the VPN to other security and privacy tools,
such as antivirus, Tor, or ﬁrewalls (6 videos, 4.6M views).
Multiple YouTubers used analogies in their ads, often cater-
ing to the channel’s audience with humorous intent (11 videos,
4.0M views). YouTubers tend to use analogies to emphasize
broad guarantees rather than to explain technical mechanisms.
One ad uses a complex Dungeons and Dragons analogy [140],
while another compares a VPN to a refrigerator [141].
Promotional prices
VPN ads also typically emphasize
promotional codes offering some kind of monetary beneﬁt, in-
cluding discounts (108 videos, 31.3M views), free-use periods
with long-term subscriptions (116 videos, 38.9M views), and
money-back guarantees (46 videos, 18.9M views). A number
of YouTubers refer speciﬁcally to NordVPN being 70% off
(e.g., [142]).
Often related to money-back guarantees, many ads mention
readily available tech support (30 videos, 6.6M views). One
YouTuber notes that “If you get confused, there is a fantastic
24/7 customer service” [143].
Emotional appeals
In a few cases, VPN ads make emo-
tional arguments for purchasing the VPN. Some tell the viewer
that buying the VPN will help the YouTuber (24 videos, 10.3M
views). Others emphasize that the user has nothing to lose,
especially when offering a free trial (7 videos, 666K views). In
many cases, the ad emphasizes that the user (10 videos, 6.1M
views) or their family is at risk without a VPN (e.g., [131]; 21
videos, 519K views). One video with 85.7K views suggests
that using a VPN is necessary to protect your country [94].
Connecting to news or other events
YouTubers often
used recent news to justify VPNs (30 videos, 9.3M views).
Examples include various data breaches and leaks, including
well-known events like the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica
scandal [134] (12 videos, 992K views). Others connect VPNs
to their own experiences (3 videos, 4.3M views), such as
noticing ﬁrsthand that ISPs capture browsing histories [144].
Though not always used to justify the use of VPNs, 11
videos with 545K views referenced COVID-19.
G. YouTubers and VPN companies: A case study of SurfShark
YouTubers receive compensation for endorsing VPNs, via
afﬁliate links and/or up-front promotional fees. It is unclear,
however, how much control VPN companies exert on the
content of these inﬂuencer ads. By providing strict instruc-
tions, a VPN company could maintain accuracy and consistent
branding, but may not leave room for the YouTuber to take
advantage of their unique relationship to their audience. At
minimum, in many cases YouTubers seem to be empowered
to include explicit or off-color content (e.g., [82]), to align
with their video content or audience.
To investigate this relationship between YouTubers and
VPN companies, we reached out to 14 VPN companies that
appeared repeatedly in our dataset and requested promotional
material, guidelines or instructions they provide to YouTubers.
Our goal was to compare the guidelines to the resulting VPN
ads created by the YouTubers. Only SurfShark shared their
materials. VirtualShield responded that, other than their logo,
they did not have a predetermined set of promotional materials,
but instead worked with YouTubers to customize material for
their needs. TunnelBear similarly said they did not have any
predetermined promotional materials. IPVanish and HideMe
directed us to their website press kits; WTFast and Private
Internet Access directed us to their afﬁliate managers, who
did not respond to our inquiries. The other 7 VPN providers
did not respond to our request.
We therefore examined SurfShark’s promotional materials
and their associated ads in depth, as a case study. Our dataset
contains 26 videos with SurfShark VPN ads (5.7M views).
SurfShark provides afﬁliates with a number of media ﬁles,
such as logos, images of the product interface, and animations
of various SurfShark features (e.g., [117]). The materials
encourage YouTubers to select content from these ﬁles that
will align with their audience. SurfShark also provides about
30 talking points covering features or beneﬁts of the product,
examples of videos with ads that “nailed it,” and tips for inte-
grating media and information into the video and description.
Different YouTubers relay information from these materi-
als very differently, but nearly all of the talking points in
the materials were mentioned by at least some YouTubers,
including concepts like “secures your data,” ease of use,
simultaneous device support across multiple platforms, travel,
use for e-commerce, protection on public Wi-Fi, utility against
censorship, unlocking other countries’ streaming libraries, IP
address protection, no-logs policy, and money-back guarantee.
Points that appear in the guidelines but not
the analyzed
dataset
include DNS privacy, customer support, and some
technical speciﬁcations such as RAM-only servers and two-
factor authentication. We hypothesize that these talking points
do not ﬁt YouTubers’ ideas about their audience or that we
simply haven’t collected enough SurfShark VPN ads.
Deviations from the provided material include overclaims
of security and privacy beneﬁts (“keep your sensitive info and
data safe, all the time” [145]; 4 videos, 597K views), as well as
potentially overstating the risk of not using a VPN (“If you’re

not using a VPN when you are surﬁng the internet, you are
playing with ﬁre” [146]; 2 videos, 1.0M views).
The SurfShark materials clearly marked additional services,
such as email and password leak alerts, as “Extra Solutions.”
YouTubers, however, at
times tended to mention these as
core VPN features (e.g., [147]), potentially leading to user
confusion or mistaken mental models.
Furthermore, SurfShark ads mention access to content more
frequently than ads for other VPN companies (§ IV-E). This
is not clearly reﬂected in the SurfShark materials, which em-
phasize privacy and security. We hypothesize this may relate
to the interests of the YouTubers SurfShark partners with, in
categories such as Lifestyle and Gaming (see Figure 6).
Overall, we found that YouTubers tended to apply the pro-
vided promotional materials or guidelines, but not precisely,
with occasionally inaccurate or potentially misleading results.
V. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
In sum, we ﬁnd that VPN ads are extremely prevalent
on YouTube, with more engagement compared to videos
that don’t have VPN ads (§ IV-A). They convey a range of
themes, including threats and technical information (§ IV-C);
some include potentially misleading claims with overpromises
and exaggerations (§ IV-D). Different sponsoring companies
emphasize different kinds of content and appear in different
categories of channels (§ IV-E). Further, a non-negligible
amount fail to adequately disclose sponsorship (§ IV-F).
Based on these results, we discuss (1) our suggestions on
what stakeholders of the VPN ad ecosystem can do to reduce
harm and increase utility, and (2) the need for further research
to quantify the impact VPN ads might have on users.
A. Improving VPN ads
Inﬂuencer VPN ads arise from a complex relationship
between VPN companies and YouTubers, in which both ben-
eﬁt from increased product sales but also have potentially
divergent brand-management strategies. VPN companies want
to take advantage of the YouTubers’ knowledge of, and close
relationships with, their audiences by allowing the YouTuber
to drive the ad content, but may not want to be held respon-
sible for everything YouTubers say. Currently, as our results
show, this complex relationship often results in misleading or
otherwise problematic ads (§ IV-D).
VPN Companies may need to create clearer guidelines
that explicitly warn against common exaggerations and mis-
conceptions (§ IV-D), as well as reminding YouTubers about
disclosure requirements (§ IV-F). VPN companies could also
review videos (before or after release) and withhold sponsor-
ship from repeat offenders. Notably, some VPN companies
already review ads [27, 82] (adult language). They could also
require YouTubers to demonstrate correct understanding of the
products before engaging in sponsorship. YouTubers can also
contribute by familiarizing themselves with the capabilities
and limitations of VPNs and refraining from exaggeration.
Currently, however, it is unclear whether VPN companies
have incentives to take any of these steps; the arms-length
relationship may allow them to enjoy the beneﬁts of exagger-
ated marketing while insulating them from repercussions. On
the other hand, better accuracy may have reputational beneﬁts,
and clearly conveying that add-on features are brand-speciﬁc
rather than inherent to any VPN might improve brand loyalty.
YouTube itself is uniquely positioned to ensure that in-
ﬂuencer ads are clearly disclosed, perhaps via automated
solutions [30]. Further, YouTube has in the past removed
videos for spreading misinformation; similar policies might be
developed for egregiously misleading ads (e.g., [113, 128]).
Government agencies already impose restrictions on false
or misleading advertising [148], and could expand efforts
to include inﬂuencer VPN ads. Alternatively, building on
suggestions from prior research [19, 20], computer security
and privacy experts could form advisory bodies, offering con-
sultation for well-intentioned advertisers who wish to ensure
their claims will not misinform viewers about digital safety.
B. Further research: How VPN ads inﬂuence viewers
On the other hand, overpromises about
Our analysis suggests that VPN ads make many claims
that have the potential to inﬂuence viewers’ mental models
not just of VPNs, but of computer security and privacy in
general (§ IV-C). Exaggerating threats may add to users’
fears: this could leave them susceptible to scams that promise
protection, or even contribute to resignation, in which people
decide that if true security or privacy is impossible, there’s no
reason even to make an effort to improve their posture [19].
the protections
VPNs can provide may lead users toward reckless behavior or
otherwise impede their ability to make appropriate decisions
about their security and privacy.
Further, we notice that not all VPNs advertise the same
features (§IV-E [149]); in some cases, additional features were
add-on products. We hypothesize that viewers may mistakenly
attribute these features to all VPNs, creating incorrect assump-
tions about the protections other VPN products may offer, or
about security and privacy on the internet more generally.
We note that it may be especially important to avoid users
forming mistaken mental models, as shifting existing security
and privacy models has proven to be a challenge [100, 150]. As
such, getting things right—or at least not harmfully wrong—in
VPN ads may have a large impact.
These speculations point at the need for further research, to
measure whether and to what extent the claims of VPN ads
are in fact negatively inﬂuencing viewers’ mental models.
