**ATT&CK ID:** G0068  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** PLATINUM

**Description:**
PLATINUM, a threat actor, has been observed transferring files using the IntelÂ® Active Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) channel.[345] 

This method leverages AMT's SOL feature, which is designed to provide out-of-band management and remote access capabilities. By exploiting this channel, PLATINUM can exfiltrate data or deliver malicious payloads, even when traditional network defenses are in place.
