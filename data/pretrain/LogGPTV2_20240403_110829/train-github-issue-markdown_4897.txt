At the moment SingleBucketAggregator extends BucketAggregator and
MultiBucketAggregation is a separate interface. This means that single bucket
Aggregations are different from multi bucket aggregations which can lead to
problems when traversing the aggregation response. The reason for this is that
single bucket aggregations don't render the same way as multi-bucket ones and
so while parsing a response you need to work out what type of aggregation you
are looking at before you know how to parse it.
If would be better if SingleBucketAggregator was a multi-bucket aggregator
which just happened to only have a single bucket. In the response there would
still be a 'buckets' field but it would only contain a single entry for
single-bucket aggregations. This would mean that single and multi bucket
aggregation could be treated the same both by users of the REST API and users
of the JAVA API.
