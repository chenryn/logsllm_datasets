Assistant: To establish a VPN connection in the company's internal network and realize the convenience of remote work for employees, the following steps can be taken: 1. Purchase a VPN service First, you can choose and purchase a VPN service, such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc. These VPN services usually provide professional encryption technology and server networks to ensure that employees' remote connections are safe and stable. 2. Deploy the VPN server Next, deploy the VPN server in the company network and connect it with each subnet within the company. This requires certain technical reserves and network knowledge. It is recommended to ask a professional network engineer or IT team to operate. 3. Assign VPN accounts After the deployment of the VPN server is completed, VPN accounts need to be assigned to employees so that they can use the VPN service provided by the company for remote connections. These accounts need to be set up on the VPN server to ensure that employees can access the required company resources and data. 4. Employees connect remotely Finally, employees can use their own devices (such as computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.) to download the VPN client and use the VPN account provided by the company for remote connections. In this way, they can use the company's network and resources as if they were in the office, realizing the convenience of telecommuting.
