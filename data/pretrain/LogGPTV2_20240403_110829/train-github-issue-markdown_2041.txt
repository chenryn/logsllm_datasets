### Issue Details
I am looking at developing an XR app now Chromium updated to version 80 -
however in order to make it work with Windows and SteamVR in chrome, I need to
disable the XR sandbox via chrome://flags. I would normally use a command line
switch for this except one does not exist.
Instead I am thinking of prompting the user to open the chrome://flags page
and disable the XR  
sandbox, however when I try to open it, it redirects me to "chrome-
error://chromewebdata/"
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 8.0.0
  * **Operating System:**
    * Windows 10 x64 Build 18362
### Expected Behavior
I can open "chrome://flags" using mainWindow.loadURL
### Actual Behavior
It redirects me to "chrome-error://chromewebdata/"
### To Reproduce
Please see the following electron fiddle:
