### Title: Uncovering Sednit's First UEFI Rootkit in the Wild: Malware Embedded Deep in SPI Flash

**Abstract:**

While BIOS rootkits have been a subject of extensive research and discussion, concrete evidence of real-world campaigns targeting this level of system compromise has been scarce. In this presentation, we will unveil a successful campaign executed by the Sednit group, also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, and APT28. This Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group is notorious for high-profile cyberattacks, such as the 2016 Democratic National Committee (DNC) email leak.

Earlier this year, a public report revealed that the Sednit group had successfully trojanized a userland LoJack agent, an embedded anti-theft application, and used it against their targets. LoJack has been under scrutiny by security researchers due to its unique persistence method, which involves a module preinstalled in the UEFI/BIOS software of many computers. Despite past findings of several security risks in this product, no significant in-the-wild activity was reported until the discovery of the Sednit group exploiting vulnerabilities in the userland agent.

However, our research has uncovered that the Sednit group did not stop there. They also succeeded in installing a custom UEFI module directly into the SPI flash memory of targeted systems. 

In this talk, we will:

- Detail the full infection chain, illustrating how Sednit managed to install their custom UEFI module on key targets' computers.
- Provide an in-depth analysis of the UEFI module and the associated trojanized LoJack agent.

This presentation will offer valuable insights into the sophisticated techniques employed by APT groups and the importance of securing the UEFI/BIOS layer in modern cybersecurity practices.
