User: I have a python script which basically lauches an Xmlrpc server. I need this script to run always. I have a function that may call for the system to reboot itself. So once the system has rebooted, I need to get the script running again. 
How can I add this to the Windows RT startup?
Assistant: You can create a scheduled task to run on login or boot. The run registry key and the startup folder do not function on Windows RT, but the task scheduler does.
Off topic (since I seem unable to add a comment to the other answer) there has been a copy of Python ported over to Windows RT using the jailbreak.
