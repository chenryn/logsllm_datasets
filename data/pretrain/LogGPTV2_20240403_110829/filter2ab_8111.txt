**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Privileged Account Management

To enhance security and limit the creation of tokens, follow these steps:

1. **Restrict Token Creation:**
   - Configure Group Policy to ensure that only the local system account can create token objects. This setting is defined in:
     - **GPO Path:** Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment
     - **Policy:** Create a token object
     - **Setting:** Assign this right only to the local system account.

2. **Limit Process-Level Token Replacement:**
   - Define who can replace a process-level token. This should be restricted to the local and network service accounts.
     - **GPO Path:** Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment
     - **Policy:** Replace a process level token
     - **Setting:** Assign this right only to the local and network service accounts.

3. **Administrator Best Practices:**
   - Administrators should log in with standard user accounts but use the `runas` command to execute tools with elevated privileges when necessary. This approach minimizes the risk associated with always using an administrator account.
     - **Command Example:** `runas /user:Administrator "tool.exe"`

By implementing these measures, you can effectively manage privileged accounts and reduce the risk of unauthorized token creation and manipulation.
