Values in curly braces denote a space of values searched over during evaluation. The most sensitive hyperparameter is the top-node partitioning, which significantly affects the structure of the search problem. It is also crucial to ensure that the rollout timestep limit and model size are sufficiently large for the problem.

## Problem Construction and Objectives
The primary objective is to minimize classification time and memory usage. This involves constructing decision trees that are both efficient and effective.

## Structured Data in Deep Learning
Recent research has focused on applying deep learning to process and generate tree and graph data structures [11, 58, 60, 61, 63, 66]. NeuroCuts leverages the inherent structure of the problem to encode agent state into a compact, fixed-length representation, thereby sidestepping the need to explicitly process graphs.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combines the modeling capacity of deep neural networks with classical reinforcement learning (RL) to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces. Notable successes include DQN [36, 37, 56], which demonstrated human-level performance in Atari 2600 games, and actor-critic algorithms like A3C, PPO, and IMPALA [7, 35, 43], which scale to many parallel workers. AlphaGo [44], AlphaGo Zero [46], and AlphaZero [45] achieved superhuman performance in complex games such as Go, chess, and shogi. DRL has also been applied to natural language processing [28] and robotics [25–27]. NeuroCuts operates in a discrete environment, using DRL to learn decision trees for packet classification.

## Deep Learning for Networking and Systems
There has been a growing interest in applying deep learning to networking and systems problems [4, 6, 16, 33, 34, 54, 62, 64, 65]. For example, NAS [62] uses client computation and deep neural networks to improve video quality, while Pensieve [34] generates adaptive bitrate algorithms without pre-programmed models. Other applications include network routing [54], traffic scheduling [4], and datacenter-scale traffic optimization [3]. Deep RL has also been used for congestion control [6, 16, 64] and resource management [33]. NeuroCuts explores the application of DRL to packet classification, proposing a new algorithm to learn decision trees with succinct encoding and scalable training mechanisms.

## Conclusion
NeuroCuts is a simple and effective DRL formulation for the packet classification problem. It provides significant improvements in classification time and memory footprint compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. NeuroCuts can easily incorporate pre-engineered heuristics, optimize for flexible objectives, and generate decision trees that are easy to test and deploy. We hope that NeuroCuts will inspire a new generation of learning-based algorithms for packet classification. For instance, NeuroCuts can be extended to optimize for average classification time by considering specific traffic patterns, allowing it to adapt to different deployment scenarios.
