I am trying to concatenating two Panels with duplicate `Items` (but different
`major_axes`) together, without actually having to duplicate items... Did some
searching but couldn't find much on SO.
Unfortunately I cannot upload pics to github at the moment.. **But screens are
attachedhere.**
To illustrate what I mean:
    # create data
    import pandas as pd
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({'A' : [1, 2, 3], 'B' : [2, 5, 6]}, index={0, 1, 2})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({'A' : [1, 2, 3], 'B' : [2, 5, 6]}, index={3, 4, 5})
    df3 = pd.DataFrame({'A' : [5, 2, 3], 'B' : [2, 5, 6]}, index={6, 7, 8})
    df4 = pd.DataFrame({'A' : [6, 2, 3], 'B' : [2, 5, 6]}, index={9, 10, 11})
    pan1 = pd.Panel({'X' : df1, 'Y': df2})
    pan2 = pd.Panel({'X' : df3, 'Y': df4})
    # concat these two panels above
    pan3 = pd.concat([pan1, pan2])
    pan3
    Output:
    Dimensions: 4 (items) x 12 (major_axis) x 2 (minor_axis)
    Items axis: X to Y
    Major_axis axis: 0 to 11
    Minor_axis axis: A to B
**Note that the`Items` axis for `pan3` is of length 4, while `pan1` and `pan2`
both have `Items` axis of length 2.**
Looking at `pan3`'s `minor_axis`, I get duplicated columns in the frame below.
**This is my problem.** :
    pan3.loc[:, :, 'B']
Screenshot: See this link on SO
**What I actually want to see** can be replicated as follows in a more
complicated way... (Not more duplicated columns in the screenshot):
    df5 = pd.concat([df1, df3])
    df6 = pd.concat([df2, df4])
    pan4 = pd.Panel({'X':df5, 'Y':df6})
    pan4.loc[:, :, 'B']

**Is this something that can be done with`pd.concat`?** Thanks guys.
