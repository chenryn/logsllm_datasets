User: I am a new user of  Sublime text. 
It has been working fine for a few days until it began to refuse to compile anything and I don't know where the problem is. I wrote python programs and pressed cmd+b and nothing happened. When I try to launch repl for this file - that also doesn't work. I haven't installed any plugins and before this issue all has been working well.
Any suggestions on how to identify/fix the problem are greatly appreciated
Assistant: Yes, you might want to give more detail. Have you made sure you have saved the file as .py? Try something simple like Print "Hello" and then see if this works.
