I am a new user of Sublime Text. The editor has been working fine for the past few days, but recently it has stopped compiling any code, and I'm unable to identify the cause of the problem.

I have been writing Python programs and using `Cmd + B` to build and run them, but now nothing happens when I do this. Additionally, attempting to launch the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for the file also fails. I have not installed any plugins, and everything was working well before this issue arose.

Any suggestions on how to diagnose and fix this problem would be greatly appreciated.

**Assistant:**

Thank you for providing these details. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Ensure File Extension**: Make sure that your file is saved with the `.py` extension. For example, `my_script.py`.

2. **Test with Simple Code**: Try running a simple Python script to see if the issue persists. For example:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
   Save the file and then try to build it using `Cmd + B`.

3. **Check Build System**: Ensure that the correct build system is set for Python. You can check this by navigating to `Tools > Build System` and selecting `Python`. If it is set to `Automatic`, Sublime Text should automatically detect the language, but setting it explicitly might help.

4. **Console Output**: Open the Sublime Text console (View > Show Console) and look for any error messages that might provide more information about what is going wrong.

5. **Reinstall Python Build System**: Sometimes, the build system files can become corrupted. You can try reinstalling the Python build system by following these steps:
   - Navigate to `Tools > Build System > New Build System...`.
   - Replace the content with the following:
     ```json
     {
         "cmd": ["python", "-u", "$file"],
         "selector": "source.python"
     }
     ```
   - Save the file as `Python.sublime-build` in the `User` package directory (you can find this by navigating to `Preferences > Browse Packages`).

If the problem still persists after trying these steps, please provide any error messages or additional details so we can further assist you.
