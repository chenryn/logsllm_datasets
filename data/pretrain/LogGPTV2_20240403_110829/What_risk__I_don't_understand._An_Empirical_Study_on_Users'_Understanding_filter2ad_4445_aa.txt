## Abstract
Users frequently encounter security information in written articles, such as newspapers, security blogs, and training materials. However, prior research indicates that these delivery methods, including security awareness campaigns, often fail to enhance people's knowledge about cyber threats. This suggests that users find such information difficult to absorb and understand. To effectively raise users' security awareness, it is crucial that they comprehend the provided information so that they can apply the advice in practice.

We conducted a subjective study to measure the level of users’ understanding of security texts. Our findings indicate that 61% of the terms used by security experts in their writings are challenging for the general public to understand, even for those with some IT background. Additionally, 88% of security texts contain at least one such term. We also observed that existing dictionaries, including online ones (e.g., Google Dictionary), cover no more than 35% of the terms found in security texts.

To improve users' ability to understand security texts, we developed a framework to build a user-oriented, security-centric dictionary from multiple sources. To evaluate the effectiveness of this dictionary, we created a tool that detects technical terms and provides explanations in pop-ups. The results of a subjective study showed that our tool could increase users' ability to understand security articles by 30%.

## 1 Introduction
In our increasingly digitized and interconnected society, cyber attacks continue to escalate and harm internet users [23]. It is recognized that humans remain the primary decision-makers in the face of cyber threats [15]. A 2017 survey by Netwrix identified IT security, compliance, and operational risks faced by organizations globally, revealing that government entities considered their employees to be the biggest threat [11]. Education in understanding security texts is critical to improving users' ability to make informed security decisions [42]. However, less than 25% of security advice is easy to understand [16].

Most users are not security experts, even if they are technically savvy. Studies have shown that two-thirds of users underestimate the extent of cyber harms, and only around 10% can correctly explain protective measures (e.g., fraud alerts) [64]. Despite efforts to improve users' understanding, such as removing complex terms [18] and enhancing security interfaces [1], the low success rate indicates that it remains challenging to get users to apply security measures in practice [17]. A key step in achieving this goal is to help users better understand security terms.

Research by the Pew Research Center tested users' knowledge of technical terms [10]. It found that most users were familiar with common terms (e.g., 'wiki') but struggled with certain concepts (e.g., 'phishing', 'virus'). Existing studies have also shown that while security advice to reduce risks [44] is helpful, it often requires a high level of education to understand and is frequently misinterpreted or ignored [13, 51]. Other studies report that half of users refuse to use security advice because they believe the concerns are unnecessary or do not understand how it works [29, 45, 61].

Despite these issues, there has been no analysis of why users' comprehension levels are low when it comes to security advice and what steps can be taken to address this. We focus on text-based means of delivering security messages (i.e., security texts) and address these questions through a series of real-world experiments designed to answer the following research questions:

**RQ1:** What are the technical terms used in security texts and their difficulty levels from a user's perspective?
**RQ2:** Are traditional methods useful in measuring the difficulty level of technical terms?
**RQ3:** Are the technical terms as difficult for people with IT backgrounds as they are for those without?
**RQ4:** What functions would users like to help them read technical articles?

Our first step was to build a dataset of security blogs, as they are a major source of computer security advice [36]. A study revealed that most users learn cybersecurity through media, especially blogs [51]. We then invited 597 participants to take part in a subjective study, where they rated their comprehension of these blogs. We generated a security corpus consisting of 6,286 technical terms from the results. Some key findings include:

- 61% of technical terms are considered difficult (with a difficulty level higher than 50% on a scale from 1 to 10) and significantly impact the comprehension of security texts.
- There is an inconsistency between users' reported difficulty levels and those of traditional readability tests, such as termhood calculation [12] and term occurrences in Google Search.
- People with IT backgrounds assign higher difficulty levels to technical terms related to cyber threats and protection measures compared to those without IT backgrounds.
- 65% of participants would like to have a dictionary-based explanation for technical terms.

The last finding motivated us to conduct an additional study to test ways to improve security text readability from a user's perspective. General dictionaries (Wikipedia Page Previews [59], Google Dictionary [22], and Mac Dictionary [4]) were not useful, as none covered more than 35% of the collected terms. Therefore, we built a specific dictionary by combining multiple sources (see Section 4). Figure 1 visually shows the steps taken for this purpose. We then developed a browser plug-in service tool that uses our dictionary to provide explanations for security terms in the form of pop-ups (see Section 4).

To determine the extent to which our tool helps users understand security texts and to identify factors influencing comprehension, we conducted a second experiment with 112 participants with different IT backgrounds. The analysis revealed:

- Our tool significantly improves users' understanding of security articles, up to 30% more than existing methods.
- Users often misunderstand ambiguous terms (e.g., terms with multiple meanings or similar to other terms).
- Users with IT backgrounds perform better in understanding security texts, but only when using our tool.

These findings can help security experts compose their advice with high readability in mind and develop tools and methods for more effective delivery of security texts. Our paper makes the following three contributions:

- We conducted an empirical study to understand the difficulties faced by users in comprehending security texts.
- We built a user-oriented, security-centric dictionary.
- We developed and implemented a tool as a service using our dictionary to help users comprehend security texts.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review related work. Sections 3 and 4 report the details of our experiments and their results. Section 5 discusses the implications and limitations. Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2 Related Work
In this section, we discuss related work on users' perceptions of security risks, their understanding of security threats, measures, and descriptions, and security education.

### Perception of Security Risks
Users' awareness of security threats is a significant concern for computer security experts. Fagan and Khan investigated the difference in risk perception between those who followed security advice and those who did not [17]. Security advice was reported to be incomprehensible to some home computer users who lacked higher education [13], making it difficult for them to take appropriate actions against security threats.

Wash conducted qualitative interviews to understand how well home computer users understood security threats [60]. He identified eight folk models of security threats, including malware and attackers, which exposed users' misunderstandings and explained why they ignored security warnings. Routi et al. conducted interviews to investigate users' perceptions of online security [51], finding that misunderstandings of browser-based TLS (Transport Layer Security) indicators led to unsafe behaviors. Wash and Rader also found that participants had different levels of security knowledge and beliefs about viruses and hackers [61].

In the Android ecosystem, Harbach et al. generated personalized examples to improve users' awareness during the app installation process [25]. Similarly, some studies [62, 63] applied static code analysis to generate security-centric descriptions or privacy policies with different sentence structures.

### Security Understanding
Howe et al. reviewed existing surveys and found that, although users were aware of and concerned about security threats, they were unable to understand them [27]. Shay et al. interviewed 394 people about the hijacking problem [55], revealing that users were aware of malware, phishing, and third-party breaches but could not apply adequate security measures. Ion et al. demonstrated the differences in security advice between experts and non-experts, such as using 2FA and password managers to prevent attacks, compared to using anti-virus programs and changing passwords frequently [29]. Later, Zou et al. built mental models of credit bureaus and found that participants were aware of data breaches but hardly understood them, leading to suffering [64]. This could be due to underestimating the possibility of becoming victims, resulting in a failure to take timely, effective measures.

Recent work has also studied the factors influencing users' understanding of computer security. Forget et al. presented the relationships between users' attitudes or behaviors and their understanding of security threats [21]. Bias in estimating technical expertise and misunderstanding risks can lead to severe attacks by applying incorrect security measures. Acquisti et al. explained the factors affecting users in security and privacy decision-making [2]. Sawaya et al. found that users' self-confidence in their knowledge affected their security behaviors more than actual knowledge [53].

### Users' Security Education
Dale et al. highlighted the necessity of cybersecurity education for raising users' awareness [50]. Significant efforts have been made to improve the delivery of security texts to end users for educational purposes. For example, SSL/TLS indicators and security warnings have been enhanced to make them more understandable [3, 38, 41, 43, 47, 48, 54, 56, 57, 58, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121,
