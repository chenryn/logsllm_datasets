User: How can I update a python script remotely. I have a program which I would like to share, however it will be frequently updates, therefore I want to be able to remotely update it so that the users do not have to re-install it every day. I have already searched StackOverflow for an answer but I did not find anything I could understand. Any help will be mentioned in the projects credit!
Assistant: A very good solution would be to build a web app. You can use django, bottle or flask for example.
Your users just connect to your url with a browser. You are in complete control of the code, and can update whenever you want without any action on their part.
They also do not need to install anything in the first place, and browser nowadays provide a lot of flexibility and dynamic content.
