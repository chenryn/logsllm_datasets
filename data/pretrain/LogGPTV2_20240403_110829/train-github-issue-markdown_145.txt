### Issue Description

Due to recent changes in CSS standards, the `CSSStyleDeclaration` indexer property no longer supports a setter. This change has led to a script error in the `setValueForStyles` function, specifically around line 82 in the file `react/packages/react-dom/src/shared/CSSPropertyOperations.js`.

### Error Details

The problematic code snippet is as follows:
```javascript
style[styleName] = styleValue;
```

### Reported Issue

This issue was reported to the Chrome team and documented in [Chromium Bug 951046](https://crbug.com/951046). The Chrome team resolved it as "by-design," indicating that this behavior is intentional.

This change affects the `setValueForStyles` function and results in a `TypeError` when attempting to set a style property. The issue has been reported to the Chrome team and is considered by-design. Two repro steps are provided to demonstrate the problem.
