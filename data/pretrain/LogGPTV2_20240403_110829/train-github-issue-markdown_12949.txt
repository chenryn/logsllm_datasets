### Description
A config that lets the scheduler choose tasks with the latest/oldest
execution_date to run first. Or perhaps a way to dynamically assign pool slots
based on the execution_date could also work.
### Use case/motivation
Sometimes the same task can have multiple task instances from different dag
runs queued and occupying pool slots. The task instance from the most recent
dag run could have a higher priority than the older ones. Currently there is
no way to prioritize that.
