ABSTRACT
The 7th ACM International Workshop on Cyber Security
Analytics, Intelligence and Automation (SafeConﬁg) is held
as part of ACM Computer and Communications Security
CCS 2014. SafeConﬁg 14, following many successful preced-
ing workshops, is concerned with developing new security
techniques and approaches that oﬀer proactive, intelligent
and a holistic security analytics based on analyzing the sys-
tem artifacts including system traces, conﬁgurations, logs,
incident reports, alarms and network traﬃc. Scalable an-
alytics techniques are essential to handle large volumes of
data and to normalize, model, integrate, analyze and re-
spond to threats in real time.

1. MOTIVATION
Ensuring correctness and integrity of system conﬁgura-
tions and associated policies are key to proper functioning,
accessibility, security, privacy and resilience of modern in-
formation systems and services. However, this is a daunting
task in large enterprise systems that may contain millions of
physical and/or virtual components that must be properly
conﬁgured and secured from unauthorized access. Further-
more, the conﬁguration variables often have explicit or hid-
den interdependencies that must be understood in order to
ensure proper end to end behavior.
The new sophisticated cyber security threats demand new
security techniques and approaches that oﬀer proactive, in-
telligent and a holistic security analytics based on analyzing
the system artifacts including system traces, conﬁgurations,
logs, incident reports, alarms and network traﬃc. Scalable
analytics techniques are essential to handle large volumes

of data and to normalize, model, integrate, analyze and re-
spond to threats in real time. As the current technology
moves toward ”smart” cyber infrastructure and open net-
working platforms (e.g. OpenFlow and virtual computing)
and integration of large variety of sensors, the need for large-
scale security analytics and automation becomes essential to
enable intelligent response, automated defense, and network
resilience and agility. This year, this installment of SafeCon-
ﬁg is being run in conjunction with the CCS (Computing and
Communications Security) conference, to be held Nov 3-7,
2014 in Scottsdale, Arizona.
2. DESCRIPTION
This workshop oﬀers a unique opportunity by bringing
together researchers from academia, industry as well as gov-
ernment agencies to discuss the challenges listed above, to
exchange experiences, and to propose joint plans for pro-
moting research and development in this area. SafeCon-
ﬁg is a one day forum that includes invited talks, techni-
cal presentations of peer-reviewed papers, poster/demo ses-
sions, and joint panels on research collaboration. SafeCon-
ﬁg was started in 2009 and has been continuously running
since then. It provides a unique forum to explore theoretical
foundations, algorithmic advances, modeling, and evaluation
of conﬁguration related challenges for large scale cyber and
cyber-physical systems.
The workshop features a keynote talk on future develop-
ment of security analytics, expert panel discussion on secu-
rity automation from sense making to decision making, and
two technical sessions that address the following topics:
• Security Analytics for Sense Making. The ﬁrst ses-
sion focuses on problems related to web applications
security, spam detection, and the security of software
repositories. P. Chen et al. [2] analyze the security of
the Chinese web by investigating the usage of client-
side security policies through a large-scale analysis of
the 10,000 most popular Chinese websites. This re-
search revealed that a signiﬁcant fraction of Chinese
websites lag behind on the adoption of good security
practices. F. Gillani and E. Al-Shaer [3] introduce an
economic metric to assist spam detectors in keeping
their false positives at bay by associating detection ac-
curacy to the spammer’s cost. They show that their
approach is eﬀective in reducing the false positives for
the detectors considerably. Finally, J. Tate and T.
Charles Clancy [6] discuss the integration of Keyless
Signature Infrastructure (KSI) technology with the git
1544source code management software for the purpose of
creating software repository systems that are resistant
to insider attacks.
• Analytics for Automated Mitigation. The second sec-
tion focuses on attack analysis and risk assessment.
M. Alsaleh and E. Al-Shaer [1] presented an objective
metric to assess the risk of cyberattacks on computer
networks taking advantage of security compliance and
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) lan-
guages. K. Sun and S. Jajodia [4] propose a new at-
tack surface expansion mechanism that focuses on ex-
panding the external attack surface, so that external
attackers cannot easily identify the real internal attack
surface from a much larger external attack surface. Fi-
nally, Y. Tanaka [5] propose a method to detect ROP
(Return-Oriented Programming) attack code, a core
technique used in zero-day attacks, eﬃciently on the
network side.
3. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The 7th ACM International Workshop on Cyber Security
Analytics, Intelligence and Automation (SafeConﬁg) brings
together practitioners and researchers, in security, analytics,
formal methods, control theory and artiﬁcial intelligence ar-
eas, to share ideas and experiences for security analytics and
automation We hope that the selected papers will serve as
a valuable reference for the future research on this ground-
breaking research ideas.
