## Feature request
Include information about _all_ chunk groups in stats. Currently
`stats.toJson` provides details about _named_ chunk groups, but there is no
way (as far as I can tell) to know what the other chunk groups are.
**What is the expected behavior?**
Stats contains enough information to know all the chunk groups that exist
(named and otherwise) and which chunks are in each).
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**
This would be helpful information for bundle analysis, for understanding
things like duplicated code and how bundles change between builds.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**
This could be implemented with a new top-level `chunkGroups` property on the
stats object, containing all the data about the chunk groups.
Alternately, a simple solution that would meet my needs would be for each
chunk to list the chunk groups it is a part of (e.g. by the chunk group ids).
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**
Yes, given some guidance towards the preferred solution.
