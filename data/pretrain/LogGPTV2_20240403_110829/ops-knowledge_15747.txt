User: Does the Python read() method behave like C's read? Might it return less than the requested number of bytes before the last chunk of the file is reached? Or does it guarantee to always return the full amount of bytes when those bytes exist to be read?
Assistant: On CPython, it will always return the number of bytes requested, unless EOF is reached.
