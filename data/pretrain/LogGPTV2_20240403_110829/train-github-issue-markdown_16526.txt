I ran into a scenario yesterday that surprised me a bit. I was using an object
literal to store some unique keys that I later extracted with a for-in loop.
The keys were all numbers, but I quickly ran into a problem at runtime because
i had forgotten that JavaScript coerces number type keys to strings for
objects.
To wit, given the coercion of keys to strings, I was surprised that this type
checked:
    var ids: Array = [];
    const myCollection = {
        0: true,
        1: true
    };
    for (var key in myCollection) {
        ids.push(key);
    }
    console.log(ids); // => ["0", "1"]
Is this expected behavior, or should this throw a compile time warning?
