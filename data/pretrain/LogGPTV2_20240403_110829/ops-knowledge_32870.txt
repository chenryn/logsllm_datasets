User:  How to implement a distributed cache system and solve the problems of cache penetration and cache avalanche
Assistant: The distributed cache system mainly includes cache servers with multiple nodes, and achieves high availability and high performance of the cache system by performing operations such as fragmentation, replication, and load balancing on the cached data. In order to solve the problem of cache penetration, two methods can be adopted: 1. Bloom filter: Hash all possible query keys into a large enough bitmap, each cache node saves a part of this bitmap, and then Then judge whether the key exists through the bitmap before the cache hits, and return directly if it does not exist. 2. Null value cache: When the value corresponding to the key is queried from the database or other data sources, store the key-value pair in the cache and set a short cache expiration time. key, since the cache has not expired, it will directly hit the cache, avoiding multiple queries to the data source. There are three common solutions to the cache avalanche problem: 1. Locking: lock the hotspot key to avoid accessing a hotspot key at the same time. 2. Set expiration time randomization: Set the expiration time of the cache to a random value to avoid cache invalidation at the same time, resulting in a query operation requiring direct access to the data source. 3. Automatic downgrade: When the cache becomes invalid or unavailable, the system can automatically switch to the database or other data sources for queries to avoid system crashes.
