## ðŸš€ Feature
The MKLDNN is enabled by default for linux based packages (both pip and
conda). However, on windows it is disabled by default and we are instructed to
compile it from source code.  
Is there any technical reason behind this, that made it disabled by default
under windows and not linux? or is it just an unintentional bug?
## Motivation
MKLDNN has a profound affect on performance specially when used in CPU only
mode. The inclusion of it by default in Windows based packages will then help
a lot.  
It may also be the reason behind the performance difference between the two
platforms (Linux being much faster than its windows counter part)
## Pitch
Enable MKLDNN by default for pip/conda packages under Windows just like Linux
