I'm working on a simple line chart which has 1 time-based column and 1
fact/metric. I've attached a screen capture of the chart dialog screen. I have
1 time column (meal_date), 1 metric sum(calories), 1 group by expression
(meal_date), and 1 sort by expression (1) defined on the data tab.
This should yield a sql query like this:
select meal_date AS meal_date,  
sum(calories) AS "Calories"  
from public.factfood  
group by meal_date  
order by 1;
Very simple, very straightforward. Even the line chart itself looks ok.
However there's no data displayed on the line chart. Additionally, there is an
extra column called _timestamp and the result set is not sorted at all. Upon
viewing the sql created, there's a lot of extra code that I would not expect
to be there. Here is the sql query code created for this line chart:
SELECT meal_date AS **timestamp, <\-- Extra/Duplicate Column, not referenced
in the dialog screen  
meal_date AS meal_date,  
sum(calories) AS "Calories"  
FROM public.factfood  
JOIN <\-- Completely unneccessary, this is a 1 table only query, so no joins
needed  
(SELECT meal_date AS meal_date**,  
sum(calories) AS mme_inner__  
FROM public.factfood  
GROUP BY meal_date  
ORDER BY 1 DESC **<\-- Order by in the wrong place, it needs to be below the
last group by **  
LIMIT 100) AS anon_1 ON meal_date = meal_date__  
GROUP BY meal_date,  
meal_date  
LIMIT 10000;

### Environment
Centos 8 o/s  
Postgres 13 DB
  * superset version: `1.2`
  * python version: `3.8`
  * node.js version: none
How do I fix these 3 errors?
I need to not have the _timestamp column but I don't see where it comes from.
There's no option to not have a Time column.  
I need to have the order by clause utilized by the correct select stmt.
Getting rid of the unnecessary join/select stmts would help.  
I need to see the datapoints on the chart. This is probably because of that
extra _timetamp column, not sure.
