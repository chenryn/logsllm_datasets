by **runningwild** :
    If there are no blank lines between the start of a file and a comment containing build
    constraints those build constraints are ignored.
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    Make two files, foo.go (no blank line before the build constraint):
    // +build ignore
    package main
    func main() {
      println("Hi!")
    }
    and bar.go:
    package main
    func main() {
      println("Hi!")
    }
    then run "go build ." in that directory.
    This fails because of duplicate definition of main().  If a blank line is inserted
    before the build constraint in foo.go the compilation succeeds as expected (inserting
    another line of comments is not sufficient).
