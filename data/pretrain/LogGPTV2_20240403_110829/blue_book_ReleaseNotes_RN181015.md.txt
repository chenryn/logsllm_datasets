## 181015 (AzSK v.3.7.0)
### Feature updates
Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
* Added new controls/SVTs for the following services:
	* Azure AD App Proxy (requires AAD admin permissions to run)
	* HDInsight (cluster level security controls) 
	* New controls for Service Fabric
* Added support for exclusion switches for GRS scan. Controls can be now excluded by specifying either ControlIds, ResourceTypeNames. This is to further support fine-grained control in CICD.
### Other improvements/bug fixes
SVTs: 
* Removed separate handling of child resource controls for SQL DB, ServiceFabric, ServiceBus and EventHub. These constituted controls which were evaluated separately for ‘child’ resources (e.g., TDE control for SQL evaluated for DB v. server level). Going forward, the parent resource control will capture the evaluation outcome of child resources as well. This helps reduce complexity in handling attestation, fix-controls, compliance snapshot features etc. in such scenarios.
* The specific controls which will merge with respective parent controls are as under:
	* SQLDatabase
		* Azure_SQLDatabase_DP_Enable_TDE
		* Azure_SQLDatabase_DP_Review_Data_Masking_Policy
	* ServiceFabric
		* Azure_ServiceFabric_AuthN_NSG_Enabled
		* Azure_ServiceFabric_Audit_Use_Diagnostics_Log
	* ServiceBus
		* Azure_ServiceBus_AuthZ_Dont_Use_Policies_At_SB_Namespace
		* Azure_ServiceBus_AuthZ_Use_Minimum_Access_Policies
	* EventHub
		* Azure_EventHub_AuthZ_Dont_Use_Policies_At_Event_Hub_Namespace
		* Azure_EventHub_AuthZ_Use_Min_Permissions_Access_Policies
* Note that in the previous sprint, we had disabled those child controls for which evaluation at parent level is sufficient per PG guidance.
Controls: 
* Included guidance for enabling diagnostics logs from the portal as well and also fixed an issue regarding steps to do so via PS cmdlet.
* Completed review of all Critical, High and Medium controls across all the DevOps Kit services to ensure that the latest Azure product changes are reflected. 
* Added automation for the following Service Fabric controls:
	* Azure_ServiceFabric_DP_Exposed_Endpoint_SSL_Secured,
	* Azure_ServiceFabric_Availability_Replica_Stateful_Size_Set_Min_3,
	* Azure_ServiceFabric_Availability_Instance_Stateless_Size_Set_Min_3
* Removed Azure_ServiceFabric_AuthZ_Security_Mode_Enabled and Azure_ServiceFabric_DP_Enable_Encryption_Stg_Acc_Store_VHD from the scanned set of controls as Service Fabric supports these by default (with no option to disable).
* Modified/updated recommendations for the following controls:
	* Azure_DataLakeAnalytics_Audit_Enable_Diagnostics_Log
	* Azure_CosmosDB_AuthZ_Enable_Firewall 
	* Azure_CosmosDB_AuthZ_Verify_IP_Range
	* Azure_NotificationHub_AuthZ_Dont_Use_Policies_At_NotificationHub_Namespace
	* Azure_ServiceBus_Audit_Review_logs 
	* Azure_DataLakeStore_DP_Encrypt_In_Transit
