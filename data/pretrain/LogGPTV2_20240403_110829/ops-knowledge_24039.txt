User: I installed python via brew, and made it my default python. If I run which python, I obtain /usr/local/bin/python. Also pip is installed via brew, which pip returns /usr/local/bin/pip.
I do not remember how I installed ipython, but I didn't do it via brew, since when I type which ipython, I obtain /opt/local/bin/ipython. Is it the OS X version of ipython?
I installed all libraries on this version of ipython, for example I have matplotlib on ipython but not on python. I do not want to re-install everything again on the brew python, rather continue to install libraries on this version of ipython. How can I install new libraries there? For example, Python Image Library, or libjpeg? 
If possible, I would like an exhaustive answer so to understand my problem, and not just a quick fix tip.
Assistant: OK, so I solved by uninstalling macport (and so the ipython I was using, which was under /opt/local/bin) and installing ipython via pip. Then I re-install what I needed (e.g. jupyter) via pip.
