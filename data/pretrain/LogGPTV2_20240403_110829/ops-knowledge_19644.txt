User: I have a Debian system currently running with python 2.5.4. I got virtualenv properly installed, everything is working fine. Is there a possibility that I can use a virtualenv with a different version of Python?
I compiled Python 2.6.2 and would like to use it with some virtualenv. Is it enough to overwrite the binary file? Or do I have to change something in respect to the libraries?
Assistant: Yes you just need to install the other version of python, and define the location of your other version of python in your command like :



virtualenv /home/payroll/Documents/env -p /usr/bin/python3
