### How to Determine if Someone Has Accessed Your Home Wi-Fi Network in the Past

You are aware of DHCP tables and apps that can scan your current network to see who is connected, but you are more interested in identifying past connections. Here’s how you can approach this:

#### 1. **Check Your Access Point's Logs**
The primary device for logging such information is your Wi-Fi access point (router). It is responsible for authenticating connection requests. Whether it logs these requests depends on its capabilities. 

- **Access the Web Interface:**
  - Log into your router’s web interface using a browser.
  - Look for a section labeled "Logs," "System Log," or "Event Log."
  - Review the logs to see if they contain records of past connections.

#### 2. **Set Up a Monitoring Device**
If your router does not log past connections, you can set up a monitoring device to keep a running log of all devices that connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- **Use Wireshark:**
  - Set up a computer with a Wi-Fi card to listen in promiscuous mode using Wireshark.
  - This will allow the computer to capture all frames, including those not addressed to it.
  - You should be able to see clients authenticating to the access point and any authentication failures.

- **Log MAC Addresses:**
  - Use ARP or DHCP to log MAC addresses of devices that connect to your network.
  - This can help you maintain a record of all devices that have ever connected to your Wi-Fi.

#### 3. **Addressing Security Concerns**
Your virus scanner stopping periodically is likely unrelated to the security of your Wi-Fi network. However, if you are concerned about the security of your Wi-Fi, here are some steps to enhance it:

- **Change Wi-Fi Password:**
  - Update your Wi-Fi password to a complex, long, random string, such as "hXs0#/;W#y38!u0aIi$o65>Ra".
  - You only need to input this once, and it will significantly increase the security of your network.

- **Change Admin Password:**
  - Change the admin password for your router to a strong, unique password.
  - This prevents unauthorized access to your router settings.

- **Update Firmware:**
  - Ensure your router’s firmware is up to date.
  - Regular updates often include security patches and improvements.

- **Disable WPS:**
  - Disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) as it can be a security vulnerability.
  - WPS can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to your network.

- **Use WPA2:**
  - Make sure your Wi-Fi network is using WPA2 (or WPA3 if available) encryption.
  - WPA2 provides a higher level of security compared to older protocols like WEP.

By following these steps, you can better secure your Wi-Fi network and maintain a record of all devices that have connected to it.
