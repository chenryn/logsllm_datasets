ABSTRACT
Previous research showed that the SSL infrastructure is a
fragile system: X.509 certiﬁcate validation fails for a non-
trivial number of HTTPS-enabled websites resulting in SSL
warning messages presented to users. Studies revealed that
warning messages do not provide easy-to-understand infor-
mation or are ignored by webbrowser users. SSL warning
messages are a critical component in the HTTPS infras-
tructure and many attempts have been made to improve
these warning messages. However, an important question
has not received suﬃcient attention yet: Why do webmasters
(deliberately) deploy non-validating, security-critical X.509
certiﬁcates on publicly available websites? In this paper,
we conduct the ﬁrst study with webmasters operating non-
validating X.509 certiﬁcates to understand their motives
behind deploying those certiﬁcates. We extracted the non-
validating certiﬁcates from Google’s webcrawler body of
X.509 certiﬁcates, informed webmasters about the problem
with the X.509 certiﬁcate conﬁguration on their website and
invited a random sample of the respective webmasters to
participate in our study. 755 webmasters participated, al-
lowing us insight into their motives. While one third of them
admitted to having misconﬁgured their webserver acciden-
tally, two thirds of them gave reasons for deliberately using
a non-validating X.509 certiﬁcate.

better be rejected. Self-signed and expired certiﬁcates, cer-
tiﬁcates that were signed by an unknown CA, certiﬁcates
that are not delivered with a complete issuer chain as well
as certiﬁcates issued for the wrong hostname result in re-
jection. Whenever there is a problem with X.509 certiﬁcate
validation, modern webbrowsers generate warning messages
so users can decide how to proceed with the (possibly) crit-
ical X.509 certiﬁcate in question.
Further research revealed that misconﬁgurations of HTTPS-
enabled webservers are a widespread issue. In 2009, the EFF
conducted an internet-wide scan of all public IPv4 addresses
on port 443 and collected the respective X.509 certiﬁcates1.
Since then, multiple projects crawled the public part of the
Internet for HTTPS certiﬁcates and analyzed diﬀerent as-
pects of their deployment in the wild. Holz et al. [5], Akhawe
et al. and the ICSI Certiﬁcate Notary [1] collected X.509
certiﬁcates either actively or passively and concluded cer-
tain properties of the current CA-based SSL infrastructure:
While previous research provides valuable insights into the
current SSL ecosystem, their focus is solely on technical as-
pects of SSL conﬁgurations or on the behavior of webbrowser
users confronted with SSL warning messages but leaves out
the following interesting questions: (1) Why are HTTPS-
enabled websites operated with non-validating X.509 cer-
tiﬁcates at all? (2) How many misconﬁgured websites are
frequently visited with webbrowsers and hence throw SSL
warning messages? (3) For how many users do SSL warn-
ing messages occur unexpectedly? Based on the knowledge
that a non-negligible percentage of SSL handshakes fail and
that a large percentage of warning messages is dismissed by
users[2], we conducted the ﬁrst qualitivate study with web-
site administrators to investigate the root causes for X.509
misconﬁguration that cause browser warning messages. We
collected 755 study results to assess the motivation for the
use of non-validating X.509 certiﬁcates on the web. We were
interested in the reasons and motivation for webmasters to
operate non-validating X.509 certiﬁcates, how these web-
masters assess the operation of their non-validating certiﬁ-
cates and the number of aﬀected users and the protected
data types. Additionally, we were interested in suggestions
to improve the usability of certiﬁcate conﬁguration.
Our ﬁndings suggest that a remarkable number of websites
that operate non-validating X.509 certiﬁcates either do so
intentionally or are not actively in use and hence do not
trigger warning messages at all. However, we also ﬁnd that
many administrators misconﬁgure their HTTPS webservers
due to the high complexity of SSL conﬁguration options or
1https://www.eﬀ.org/observatory
507due to a misunderstanding of the security features of SSL.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We
conduct the ﬁrst user-study with webmasters of HTTPS-
enabled websites to identify the root causes for SSL warning
messages in modern webbrowsers. (2) We ﬁnd that a large
amount of non-validating certiﬁcates is meant to be that
way and clicking through them can be classiﬁed as deliber-
ate. (3) We ﬁnd that mainly websites with a manageable
user count throw certiﬁcate validation errors.
In many of
these cases the users were previously informed, have proba-
bly been helped with the installation of the respective CA
or trust the certiﬁcate and thus are not shown a warning
message when browsing the site. (4) We report that a re-
markable amount of websites employing non-validating cer-
tiﬁcates as can be found by crawlers are not meant to be
actively used, are only ever accessed by crawlers and thus
do not trigger real world warning messages for users. (5)
We ﬁnd that a substantial number of webmasters are over-
whelmed by the complexity of SSL and the conﬁguration
parameters oﬀered by HTTPS webservers. (6) We provide a
list of suggestions to improve the usability of X.509 certiﬁ-
cate conﬁguration on webservers given by the webmasters.
2. BACKGROUND
The SSL protocol provides authentication based on the
X.509 public key infrastructure2, protects data conﬁdential-
ity using symmetric encryption, and ensures data integrity
with cryptographic message digests. SSL is commonly used
to secure websites and mail servers, prevent network attack-
ers from eavesdropping or replaying the client’s messages,
and is generally considered security best practice for web-
sites using the HTTPS protocol3.
2.1 Browser Certiﬁcate Validation
Basically X.509 certiﬁcate validation in browser software
consists of the following steps: (1) check if the certiﬁcate
was digitally signed by a trusted issuer, (2) check if the cer-
tiﬁcate is not already expired, (3) check if the certiﬁcate was
issued for the requested hostname.
(1) This step veriﬁes whether a server’s certiﬁcate was issued
by a trusted CA of which modern browsers usually include
more than 100. Common reasons for failures in practice are
X.509 certiﬁcates that were self-signed or signed by unknown
CAs, e. g. CAs used in an enterprise context. (2) An X.509
certiﬁcate has a validity period of typically 12 or 24 months.
In this step browsers check if the certiﬁcate was delivered
within its validity period and otherwise reject it.
(3) Fi-
nally, browsers check if the given certiﬁcate’s common name
or subject alternative names match the server’s hostname.
A widespread real world reason for hostname mismatches
are certiﬁcates used for hostnames without the www. preﬁx
although the certiﬁcate was only issued for the preﬁx or vice
versa.
2.1.1 SSL Warning Messages
In case X.509 certiﬁcate validation fails, modern browsers
show their users warning messages. These warning messages
might imply that a Man-In-The-Middle attack occurred, i. e.
that an attacker exchanged the server’s original certiﬁcate
with their own, to eavesdrop or alter data sent between the
2https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt
3https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818
client and server. Another reason for failures are misconﬁg-
ured servers, e. g. a webmaster did not update an already ex-
pired certiﬁcate or operates a certiﬁcate for an invalid host-
name. In case browsers are certain that an attack is occur-
ing, the presented warning message cannot be bypassed. If
there is a chance that the warning message is a false positive
(i. e.
the website’s administrator (deliberately) misconﬁg-
ured the X.509 certiﬁcate), browsers will show a bypassable
warning message, discouraging users from clicking through.
3. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, we present the ﬁrst study
with webmasters on the root causes of misconﬁgured X.509
certiﬁcates for HTTPS webservers. Although no other stud-
ies focused on the same topic, the motivation for our work
is built on related work which we will discuss in this sec-
tion. As mentioned above, several projects either actively
or passively measured – or, respectively, are still measuring
– the condition of the HTTPS ecosystem. Akhawe et al. [1]
passively collected SSL handshakes of multiple US univer-
sities and 300,000 users over a period of nine months in
2012 and 2013, concentrating on the frequency of X.509 cer-
tiﬁcate validation errors in SSL handshakes. Overall, they
found that 98.46% of the 3.9 billion SSL handshakes they
monitored validated correctly, while 1.54% failed for dif-
ferent reasons: 70.51% used an unknown issuer, 2.99% a
self-signed certiﬁcate, in 7.65% of all handshakes the cer-
tiﬁcate was expired and 18.82% of all handshakes gener-
ated hostname validation errors. Due to the unlikeliness of
an actual Man-In-The-Middle attack, they assume all val-
idation errors to be false positives. Durumeric et al. [3]
presented ZMap – a fast internet-wide scanner – and con-
ducted 110 scans of the world-wide HTTPS infrastructure
over one year, collecting more than 42 million unique cer-
tiﬁcates of which 6.9 million were browser trusted. In 2009,
Sunshine et al. [6] conducted lab studies with over 400 in-
ternet users to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of browser SSL
warning messages, as well as their human understandabil-
ity, ﬁnding that participants made unsafe choices when con-
fronted with warning messages. They suggest reducing the
number of warning messages altogether, taking the decision
whether to trust an unsafe connection or not out of the users’
hands.
In 2013, Akhawe and Porter Felt [2] used Firefox
and Chrome’s telemetry feature to measure click-through
rates for SSL (and other) warning messages for diﬀerent
browsers in situ. Over a period of two months, they col-
lected 16,704,666 SSL warning impressions for Chrome and
10,976 for Firefox. However, they were not able to see the re-
spective handshakes or certiﬁcates that led to the warnings,
thus they assume that almost all warning messages they saw
were false positives.
4. WEBMASTER STUDY
While previous research either focused on a technological
analysis of the deployed X.509 certiﬁcates in the wild or eval-
uated the users’ behaviour when faced with an SSL warning
message, our work incorporates the third important pillar in
the SSL infrastructure: the webmasters of HTTPS-enabled
websites. Knowing the technical reasons why SSL hand-
shakes fail and produce warning messages and how users re-
act to those warning messages are important aspects. How-
ever, to achieve a better understanding of the whole picture,
508we conduct the ﬁrst study with webmasters to assess the
root causes why webmasters operate non-validating X.509
certiﬁcates.
4.1 Methodology
To ﬁnd websites that operate non-validating X.509 cer-
tiﬁcates, we gathered certiﬁcates deployed in the wild in
a ﬁrst step. We applied a technique diﬀerent from previ-
ous work to collect X.509 certiﬁcates from websites: We
used the body of certiﬁcates Google’s webcrawler collected
over a period of 12 months. The webcrawler collected X.509
certiﬁcates for 55,675,334 (∼ 55.7 million) diﬀerent hosts
(identiﬁed as diﬀerent domain names), resulting in a body
of 4,487,463 X.509 certiﬁcates and their corresponding host-
names. This certiﬁcate body overcomes two essential prob-
lems common to other approaches reported in literature: (1)
