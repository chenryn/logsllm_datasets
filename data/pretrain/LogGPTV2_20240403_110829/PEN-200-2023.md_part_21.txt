Listing 57 - Using iptables to monitor nmap traffic for a port scan on ALL TCP ports
A similar local port scan explicitly probing all 65535 ports generated about 4 MB of traffic - a
significantly higher amount. However, this full port scan has discovered more ports than the
default TCP scan found.
Our results imply that a full Nmap scan of a class C network (254 hosts) would result in sending
over 1000 MB of traffic to the network. Ideally, a full TCP and UDP port scan of every single target
machine would provide the most accurate information about exposed network services. However,
we clearly need to balance any traffic restrictions (such as a slow uplink) with discovering
additional open ports and services via a more exhaustive scan. This is especially true for larger
networks, such as a class A or B network assessment.
There are modern port scanners like MASSCAN257 and RustScan258 that, although
faster than Nmap, generate a substantial amount of concurrent traffic. Nmap, on

the other hand, imposes some traffic rate limiting that results in less bandwidth
congestion and more covert behavior.
Having learned about Nmap’s basic use, we’ll now explore some of Nmap’s various scanning
techniques, beginning with Stealth / SYN Scanning.
The most popular Nmap scanning technique is SYN, or “stealth” scanning.259 There are many
benefits to using a SYN scan and as such, it is the default scan option used when no scan option
is specified in an nmap command and the user has the required raw socket privileges.
SYN scanning is a TCP port scanning method that involves sending SYN packets to various ports
on a target machine without completing a TCP handshake. If a TCP port is open, a SYN-ACK
should be sent back from the target machine, informing us that the port is open. At this point, the
port scanner does not bother to send the final ACK to complete the thyree-way handshake.

Listing 58 - Using nmap to perform a SYN scan
Because the three-way handshake is never completed, the information is not passed to the
application layer and as a result, will not appear in any application logs. A SYN scan is also faster
and more efficient because fewer packets are sent and received.
Please note that term “stealth” refers to the fact that, in the past, firewalls would
fail to log incomplete TCP connections. This is no longer the case with modern
firewalls and although the stealth moniker has stuck around, it could be
misleading.
The next Nmap scanning method we’ll explore is named TCP Connect Scanning, which, as the
name suggests, performs a full TCP connection.

When a user running nmap does not have raw socket privileges, Nmap will default to the TCP
connect scan260 technique. Since an Nmap TCP connect scan makes use of the Berkeley sockets
API261 to perform the three-way handshake, it does not require elevated privileges. However,
because Nmap has to wait for the connection to complete before the API will return the status of
the connection, a TCP connect scan takes much longer to complete than a SYN scan.
We may occasionally need to perform a connect scan using nmap, such as when scanning via
certain types of proxies. We can use the -sT option to start a connect scan.

The output shows that the connect scan resulted in a few open services that are only active on
z
the Windows-based host, especially Domain Controllers, as we’ll cover shortly. One major
takeaway, even from this simple scan, is that we can already infer the underlying OS and role of
D
the target host.
Having reviewed the most common Nmap TCP scanning techniques, let’s learn about UDP
Scanning.
When performing a UDP scan,262 Nmap will use a combination of two different methods to
determine if a port is open or closed. For most ports, it will use the standard “ICMP port
unreachable” method described earlier by sending an empty packet to a given port. However, for
common ports, such as port 161, which is used by SNMP, it will send a protocol-specific SNMP
packet in an attempt to get a response from an application bound to that port. To perform a UDP
scan, we’ll use the -sU option, with sudo required to access raw sockets.

Listing 61 - Using nmap to perform a combined UDP and SYN scan
Our joint TCP and UDP scanD revealed additional open UDP ports, further disclosing which services
are running on the target host.
We can now extend what we have learned from a single host and apply it to a full network range
through Network Sweeping.
To deal with large volumes of hosts, or to otherwise try to conserve network traffic, we can
attempt to probe targets using Network Sweeping techniques in which we begin with broad
scans, then use more specific scans against hosts of interest.
When performing a network sweep with Nmap using the -sn option, the host discovery process
consists of more than just sending an ICMP echo request. Nmap also sends a TCP SYN packet to
port 443, a TCP ACK packet to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request to verify whether a host
is available.

We can also sweep for specific TCP or UDP ports across the network, probing for common
services and ports in an attempt to locate systems that may be useful or have known
vulnerabilities. This scan tends to be more accuratoe than a ping sweep.

At this point, we could conduct a more exhaustive scan against individual machines that are
service-rich or are otherwise interesting.
There are many different ways we can be creative with our scanning to conserve bandwidth or
lower our profile, as well as interesting host discovery techniques264 that are worth further
research.
We have now scanned hosts that revealed a few services, so we can guess the nature of the
target’s operating system. Luckily for us, Nmap is already shipped with an OS Fingerprinting
option.
OS fingerprinting265 can be enabled with the -O option. This feature attempts to guess the target’s
operating system by inspecting returned packets. This works because operating systems often
use slightly different implementations of the TCP/IP stack (such as varying default TTL values

and TCP window sizes), and these slight variances create a fingerprint that Nmap can often
identify.
Nmap will inspect the traffic received from the target machine and attempt to match the
fingerprint to a known list. By default, Nmap will display the detected OS only if the retrieved
fingerprint is very accurate. Since we want to get a rough idea of the target OS, we include the –
osscan-guess option to force Nmap print the guessed result even if is not fully accurate.
For example, let’s consider this simple nmap OS fingerprint scan.
