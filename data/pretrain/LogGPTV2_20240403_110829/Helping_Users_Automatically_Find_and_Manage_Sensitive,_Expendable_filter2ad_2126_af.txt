formed better for images than for documents. While this can
be an artifact of the underlying data, we hypothesize that
some of the signiﬁcant features for images, such as the “adult,”
“racy,” and “violent” features, are evidently easier to automat-
ically detect among images of diﬀerent users. For documents,
we observed that while there were standardized classes of sig-
niﬁcant and clearly identiﬁable features (e.g., PII and ﬁnancial
information) that are straightforward to detect, qualitative re-
sponses from participants suggest the presence of a strong
temporal relevancy of these features. Our classiﬁer does not
account for contexts, temporal or otherwise. Similarly for

some images, participants described sensitive pictures as hav-
ing sentimental value (e.g., pictures of children, loved ones).
Directly predicting sensitivity of this kind from our features
is not feasible. This task certainly merits deeper investigation.
Future work to further improve our understanding of ﬁle
sensitivity and ﬁle management should focus on longitudinal
studies. This will enable us to passively observe participants’
actions over time, rather than actively asking the participant
to make management decisions. Longitudinal data will en-
able building a sensitivity persona that can account for the
variation in sensitivity perceptions among individuals. The
success of a classiﬁer depends to a large extent on the training
and testing data coming from the same distribution. If the
covariate distribution changes over time, a problem known as
concept drift, then the classiﬁers would need to be updated
and account for this concept drift in order to perform well.
While in this work we lacked longitudinal data and were thus
unable to check for concept drift, a quantitative evaluation of
the drift eﬀect on classiﬁer performance for retrospective ﬁle
management would be a fruitful direction for future work.
Additionally, future work should focus on broadening the
participant pool to minimize sources of potential bias and
better account for cultural diversity, as well as understand-
ing the trade-oﬀ between ﬁle management and the associated
risk of sensitive ﬁles. This can be achieved by developing
and widely deploying an eﬀective user management inter-
face with additional surveys, which can surface these ideas
eﬃciently. Overall, these eﬀorts would minimize our current
limitations and operationalize the results of our work to im-
prove Aletheia’s performance.
