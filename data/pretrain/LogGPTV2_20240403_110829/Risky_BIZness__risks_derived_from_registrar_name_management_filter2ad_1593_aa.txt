## Abstract
In this paper, we investigate a domain hijacking risk that arises as an unintended consequence of undocumented operational practices between domain registrars and registries. Over the past nine years, more than 512,000 domains have been inadvertently exposed to the risk of hijacking, affecting popular top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com and .net, as well as tightly controlled legacy TLDs like .edu and .gov. We demonstrate that this vulnerability has been exploited by multiple parties, who have taken control of 163,000 domains without any legitimate ownership interest. In addition to characterizing the nature and scale of this issue, we also report on the effectiveness of remediation efforts in response to our outreach with registrars.

## 1 Introduction
The security of the Domain Name System (DNS) relies on the integrity of name resolutions. When a user types `www.amazon.com` into their browser, they expect to reach the correct website. Strong security measures, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), implicitly assume the integrity of name resolution, as key certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt base their due diligence on domain control [10]. However, if an attacker can substitute their own answers for DNS queries, these security assumptions are violated.

Most domain hijacking incidents have resulted from active attacks, such as compromising accounts with authority over a domain's zone records [7] or cache poisoning attacks on the DNS resolution protocol itself [20]. In this paper, we explore an alternative route for domain hijacking that is not due to attacker compromise or domain owner misconfiguration but is instead an unintended byproduct of long-standing, undocumented registrar practices.

Specifically, we examine risks associated with the use of third-party nameservers where the nameserver domain is scheduled for removal by its registrar. For such actions, registrars use the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), which provides a standard interface for managing domain names and nameservers within each domain registry. However, when a domain has subordinate host objects (typically representing nameservers) referenced by other domains, EPP constraints prevent the domain from being removed. Registrars have developed a workaround by renaming these host objects within the EPP system, often giving them a new domain name under a different TLD. We refer to these renamed nameservers as "sacrificial nameservers."

For example, if the nameserver `ns2.example.com` expires, it might be renamed to `{randomstring}.biz`. Any .com domain that had delegated its nameservice to `ns2.example.com` would find that nameserver silently replaced with `{randomstring}.biz`. This renaming is typically mechanical, and no attempt is made to register the new domain name or validate its uniqueness. Consequently, any party controlling `{randomstring}.biz` can control name resolution for all domains that previously used `ns2.example.com`.

This process is complex and counterintuitive, explaining why it has gone unnoticed despite nearly two decades of practice. Our analysis of zone data over the last nine years shows that this operational pattern has put at least half a million domains at risk of hijacking. Furthermore, we show that this risk has been actively exploited by multiple parties, who have registered the domains for at least 9,173 sacrificial nameservers, gaining control over more than 163,000 domains. Additionally, 6% of the currently exposed domains maintain alternative nameservers, indicating that they may continue to operate without realizing the risk.

Our contributions include:
- **Identifying Renaming Practices**: We develop a systematic methodology to identify sacrificial nameserver renaming and characterize the practices used by registrars.
- **Quantifying Scope and Scale**: Using almost a decade of archival zone file data, we quantify the number of domains exposed to hijacking and the dynamics of this exposure over time.
- **Characterizing Abuse**: We empirically establish the feasibility of domain name hijacking via registering sacrificial nameserver domains, both through controlled experiments and by documenting real-world cases.
- **Remediation Efforts**: We have worked with registrars and registries to address this issue, leading some registrars to change their operational practices and remediate existing vulnerabilities.

We also discuss the challenges in fixing this problem going forward.

## 2 Background

### 2.1 DNS Namespace and Protocol
The DNS is built around a hierarchical namespace (documented in RFC 1034 [17]) where administrative authority is explicitly delegated to non-overlapping zones following a tree-based structure. The root of the DNS name tree delegates authority for top-level domains (e.g., .com, .gov) to nameservers responsible for those TLDs. These nameservers can further delegate their portion of the namespace to other servers, and each zone can sub-delegate more specific portions of the namespace.

The DNS query protocol, standardized in RFC 1035 [18], describes how DNS network queries should be issued, interpreted, and routed to find the nameservers that provide authoritative answers for the queried portion of the namespace. The protocol is designed to maximize locality, reducing latency and load.

### 2.2 Name Registration and Provisioning
The DNS standard does not detail how domain names are procured or how namespace delegation is managed across nameservers. However, these details are critical for the DNS to function correctly.

Most top-level domains are managed by administrative entities called registries, which operate under contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) (e.g., for gTLDs and most legacy TLDs) or represent sovereign naming interests (ccTLDs, such as .us or .ru). Registries are responsible for the database of registered names directly underneath the TLD and for the nameservers that delegate authority under that namespace. Some registries outsource their technical operations to specialists (e.g., Afilias).

Registries provide delegation for all registered domain names used in the DNS. However, provisioning new domain names or changing their delegation is typically handled by third parties called registrars. Registrars act as an interface between customers who wish to obtain or manage a domain name and the registries that maintain authoritative delegation information. For example, a customer seeking to obtain `riskybiziness.com` would contract with a registrar (e.g., GoDaddy), who would engage with the registry (Verisign) to claim the name and install the customer’s choice of nameserver (NS) records in the .com zone. Importantly, registrars can contract with many registries, and there can be many registrars who contract with each individual registry.

### 2.3 Domain Hijacking
Domain hijacking occurs when an outside party controls the name resolution for a domain without the consent of the domain owner. If an outside party can control the resolution, their lack of ownership interest is irrelevant because their control over resolution is what matters. Hijacking can be used for site defacement, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and further compromise. Users visiting the hijacked domain will not realize they are not at the expected site.

Domain hijacking can occur in several ways. One well-known method is DNS cache poisoning, where carefully forged and timed DNS responses are injected to convince recursive resolvers to accept and cache false authoritative information [6, 20]. Another class of attacks involves the theft of credentials, either the domain owner’s or those of a registrar or registry administrator with authority to update records [7, 15].

Hijacking can also result from errors or inconsistencies in nameserver delegation. If a nameserver to whom responsibility for a domain is delegated cannot provide authoritative information, it is referred to as a lame delegation. Dangling delegations are a special case where some resource (e.g., the domain name or IP address) is unclaimed and can be acquired by an attacker for domain hijacking. Liu et al. first documented the presence of domains whose nameserver domains have expired, allowing adversaries to purchase them [16]. Bryant documented a large-scale version of this problem, where stale NS records at the .io registry provided a mechanism to hijack all subordinate domains [4]. Vissers et al. extended these ideas to cover nameserver domains dependent on dangling names, as well as accidental dangling (typos) and bit errors (bit squatting) [21]. Recently, Alowaisheq et al. [3] showed that stale records in the domain’s zone provided sufficient means for hijacking.

Akiwate et al. provided a recent measurement survey of lame delegations across the Internet and, in the process, first identified the issue of registrar-based renaming [2]. Our work builds on this and explores the prevalence of this practice among registrars, characterizes the scale and scope of the risk, and identifies the extent to which it is being actively used to hijack domains.
