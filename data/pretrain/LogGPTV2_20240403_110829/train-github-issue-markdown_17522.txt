GradientBoostingClassifier does not work correctly, when the BasePredictor
(init) is set to something like linear_model.LogisticRegression().
I thinks the source of the error is in in BaseGradientBoosting.fit() where  
# init predictions  
y_pred = self.init_.predict(X)
y_pred should be initialized by class probabilities and not with the winner
class.
Replacing y_pred = self.init_.predict(X) with y_pred =
self.init_.predict_proba(X) can solve the problem.
