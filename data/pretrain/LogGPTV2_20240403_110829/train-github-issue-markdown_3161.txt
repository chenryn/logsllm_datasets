# What's Happening?
When (somehow) which "defaultProfile" is not able to run like miss-typing
"commandline" goes like "powershell.ex" (no e) so there is no program to run
it, windows terminal just shuts down when opening terminal, (or not the
command line program, like office program WINWORD.EXE => opens word program
and terminal shuts down.) and never can be opened before finding profiles.json
and change wrong thing manually or change defaultProfile to which it can be
run on windows terminal.
# Proposed technical implementation details
So, If something that (Cannot use Windows terminal because of profiles.json)
happens, Opening a popup "Can't load Terminal" with button open profiles.json
**before Windows Terminal shuts down** like the image

or just not load any kind of commandline and **make a select screen** which
profile to load for user like this image
