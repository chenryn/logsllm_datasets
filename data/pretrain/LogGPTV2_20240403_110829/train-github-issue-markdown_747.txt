This is very simple react component run from 'pages/index.js' (sorry, but I
don't know why the code is not formatted properly in this example).
If I change input value to, say, 'click Me' then the page is HMR'ed and
changes are immediately reflected in the browser. However, if I change
`console.log` in the `handler()` to, say, 'some other message' then changes
are not reflected in the browser and I have to do a hard refresh to pick up
the changes. I would think that this change should be picked up but I could be
wrong and it's normal.
    export default class Test extends React.Component {
        handler = () => { console.log('some message')}
        render () {
          return ( ) 
       }
    }

## Expected Behavior
If I change `console.log('message')` to `console.log('some message')` and save
the file and click the button then I would expect this changes to be picked up
by HMR and see 'some message' in the browser's console output
## Current Behavior
I don't see these changes and I have to do a hard refresh in order to see them
in the browser.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Just run the sample code provided and change variables as described.
  2.   3.   4. 
## Context
It's not affecting me in any meaningful way. I can do a hard refresh if that's
by design.
