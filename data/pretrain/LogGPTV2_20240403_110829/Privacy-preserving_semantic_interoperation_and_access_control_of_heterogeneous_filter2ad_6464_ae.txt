plemented RBAC-based information sharing on a syntactic
level. De Capitani di Vimercati, and Samarati have shown
how authorization speciﬁcation and enforcement can be im-
plemented in federated database systems [9]. Dawson, Qian,
and Samarati, discuss how security can be provided while
enabling interoperation of heterogeneous systems [8]. How-
ever, their system does not have provisions to preserve the
privacy & conﬁdentiality of the metadata of the information
sources.
There has been substantial work on querying databases
with encrypted data [13]. They tackle data inference at-
tacks while PACT tackles metadata inference attacks. They
are complimentary to PACT since we can simply plug in a
database with encrypted data in the PACT infrastructure,
and enable interoperation in such a setting with simple mod-
iﬁcations.
Regarding semantic access control, Qin and Atluri intro-
duced concept-level semantic access control for the semantic
web [17]. Their work deals with how terms naming resources
(whose access is being controlled) can be rewritten using
other terms subject to logical rules expressed using OWL.
Qu, et al.
[18], have presented an ontology-based rights
expression language built on top of OWL. Damiani, et al.
[7] have discussed how policy languages can be extended for
the semantic web. Agarwal and Sprick [2, 3], and Yague and
Troya [21, 20] have presented frameworks for access control
policies for semantic web services.
8. CONCLUSION
In this work, we outline PACT, a novel mediation based
solution to provide maximum privacy and conﬁdentiality for
metadata, queries and data while enabling interoperation
among heterogeneous databases. PACT incurs only a minor
performance degradation in comparison to existing interop-
eration systems.
