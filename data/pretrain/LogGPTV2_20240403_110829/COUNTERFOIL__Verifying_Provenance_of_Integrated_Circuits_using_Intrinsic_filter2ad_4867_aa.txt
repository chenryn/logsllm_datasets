Abstract
Counterfeit integrated circuits are responsible for billions of
dollars in losses to the semiconductor industry each year,
and jeopardize the reliability of critical systems that unwit-
tingly rely on them. Counterfeit parts, which are primarily
recycled, test rejects, or legitimate but regraded, have to date
been found in a number of systems, including critical de-
fense systems. In this work, we present COUNTERFOIL – an
anti-counterfeiting system based on enrolling and authenticat-
ing intrinsic features of the molded packages that enclose a
majority of semiconductor chips sold on the market. Our sys-
tem relies on computer-readable labels, inexpensive cameras,
imaging processing using OpenCV, and digital signatures, to
enroll and verify chip packages. We demonstrate our approach
on a dataset from over 100 chips. Our method is able to au-
thenticate chips within 150ms, which makes it suitable for
real-time use in pick-and-place machines. We show that our
technique is effective and reliable for verifying provenance
under a variety of settings, and evaluate the robustness of the
package features by using different imaging platforms, and
by wearing the chips with silicon carbide polishing grit in a
rock tumbler. We show that, even if an adversary steals the
exact mold used to produce an enrolled chip package, he will
have limited success in being able to counterfeit the chip.
1 Introduction
Integrated Circuits (ICs) take on critical roles in today’s soci-
ety, but the supply and distribution channels for ICs present a
large, diverse, and vulnerable attack surface. One such threat
is counterfeit parts, which are a signiﬁcant and increasing
threat to the reliability of electronic systems. Counterfeits are
deﬁned by the US Department of Defense as “unauthorized
copies and previously used parts that are made to look new,
and are sold as new” [45]. Misrepresented ICs such as speed
binned parts that are remarked to a higher speed grade to
increase selling price [43] can also be considered counter-
feits. Prior research claims that recycled and remarked chips
together make up 80% of all counterfeiting incidents [20].
These types of counterfeit parts are enabled by a lack of trace-
ability through distribution channels as parts change hands
through resellers and system integrators. DARPA notes that
chain-of-custody solutions are unworkable for securing dis-
tribution due to components that may change hands 15 times
before ﬁnal installation [30]. Our work addresses this critical
security problem by giving an approach for securing parts
through distribution channels without chain-of-custody.
Estimates variously place the direct losses from electron-
ics counterfeiting at $3B-$7.5B [27], and the potential risk
due to counterfeiting at $100B-$200B [41, 43]. The most
commonly counterfeited electronics are said to be analog ICs,
microprocessors, memories, programmable logic, and discrete
transistors [20, 26]. Documented cases of counterfeit parts
include purported microcontrollers that were found to be re-
marked voltage regulators [51], four instances of counterfeit
parts in the Avionics Systems of C-27J aircraft [48], and refur-
bished ﬂash memory devices in Terminal High-Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) mission computers that led to a recall of
50 systems [45].
Counterfeit parts such as these present clear security risks.
However, it is important to note that these counterfeit parts
are not targeted attacks against the speciﬁc systems in which
they were found. Instead, the counterfeit parts are created
and sold to earn proﬁt. Their inclusion in critical systems is
coincidence, due to the complicated global supply chain that
allows common parts to be purchased on the market without
clear and veriﬁable evidence about their provenance.
In this work we propose and evaluate COUNTERFOIL, a
system that uses inexpensive cameras to check intrinsic vari-
ations in semiconductor packaging as means of verifying
provenance. We name our system COUNTERFOIL both to re-
ﬂect its aim of foiling counterfeits, and because the enrollment
records it uses are analogs for counterfoils kept by issuers
of cheques1. The speciﬁc contributions of this paper are as

follows:
• We show, for the ﬁrst time, that individual chip packages
can be recognized and authenticated using intrinsic vari-
ations in surface features, and that even chip packages
produced by the same mold can be distinguished. While
there are a number of research publications that authen-
ticate objects from unique features, ours is distinct in
exploiting surface variations in molded parts.
• We present a system, based on low cost cameras, im-
age processing, and digital signatures, that can validate
provenance of chips and thereby help keep counterfeits
out of systems.
• We evaluate the performance of the system with regards
to authentication, runtime, tolerance to variation in light-
ing and magniﬁcation, and resilience against wear.
2 Background and Related Work
Strategies for preventing counterfeit parts from being used
in systems can be broadly classiﬁed as either trying to detect
anomalies, or else authenticating individual chip instances
that are trusted.
2.1 Anomaly Detection as Counterfeit Testing
A common approach in counterfeit identiﬁcation is to train
a model based on a population of known good parts. When
faced with a part of unknown provenance, a battery of tests is
then applied and a classiﬁer is used to evaluate its consistency
with the trained model. The applied tests include physical
inspection (visual [4], x-ray imaging, microblast analysis of
the surface, spectroscopy, ion chromatography), electrical in-
spections [7,29], and checking for aging using silicon odome-
ters [2], ring oscillators [21], dynamic current signatures in
adders [57], or other circuits that change in a measurable
way with use. If any tests reveal an anomaly, the part can be
deemed counterfeit. Anomaly detection techniques are used
as part of qualiﬁcation procedures by the US Department
of Defense to minimize the risk of counterfeits, but “may
not deﬁnitively distinguish authentic parts from counterfeit
parts” [47]. Machine learning and neural network based tech-
niques [49] detect anomalies in microscopic features to clas-
sify genuine and counterfeit parts. Unlike these approaches
our technique relies on extracting unique ﬁngerprints from
individual parts to authenticate provenance and thereby detect
counterfeits.
2.2 Authenticating Trusted Parts
An alternative to anomaly detection is to identify and authen-
ticate individual part instances using unique or hard to clone
features. If a part is trusted at one point in time, and later a part
can be validated as being the same one that was earlier trusted,
then a judgment can be made that the part is still trustworthy.
Non-microchip versions of this style of object authentication
include human ﬁngerprints [16], anti-counterfeiting features
in currency [42], variations in surface texture of blank pa-
per [11] and 3D printed products [32], and variations in the
length of compact disc pits and lands [22]. Similarly, Physical
Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a type of physical ﬁnger-
print that can be used for authentication of parts. PUFs can be
based on random delays in silicon [18], power-up ﬁngerprints
of Static Random Access Memory [19, 24, 50], randomly
scattered dielectric particles in a protective coating [55], or
unique Radio Frequency emissions [12,13], among many oth-
ers. PUFs have also been used in conjunction with RFID-tags
to detect counterfeits [54].
Several existing strategies for validating provenance of mi-
crochips are implicitly relying on the IC package as the basis
for trusting the enclosed silicon die. The DARPA SHIELD
project aims to embed inside IC packaging a secure dielet
that can be interrogated wirelessly to validate provenance
of the part [30]. A company called Applied DNA Sciences
offers a botanical DNA taggant that can be applied to various
goods including microchip packages [23] to support traceabil-
ity through distribution. To date, working with the Defense
Logistics Agency (DLA) of the US Department of Defense,
the technology has marked over 700,000 microchips [38].
Both package-embedded dielets and package tagging have an
underlying assumption that an adversary cannot easily swap
a microchip out of its package, and therefore validating the
package provenance sufﬁces to validate the provenance of
enclosed microchip. We will use this same assumption in our
work which is based on packaging.
2.3 Transfer Molding for IC Packaging
Like DARPA SHIELD and DNA tags, our approach (Fig. 2)
also uses the IC package as a basis for trusting parts. How-
ever, our technique exploits intrinsic features of IC packages
instead of adding something to the package. We give in this
subsection for reference an overview of how IC packages are
created.
Transfer molding (Fig. 1) is the typical procedure used for
packaging high-volume integrated circuits [6, 10]. Most DIP
(dual in-line package), SMT (Surface-Mount Technology),
and QFP (Quad Flat Package) packages are created this way,
as well as more advanced packaging styles such as system-
in-package. In the transfer molding process, each silicon die
is ﬁrst attached to a metal leadframe, and the pads from the
die are wire-bonded to the individual leads to create electrical
connections. Each leadframe-mounted die is then placed in a
mold cavity, with the leads extending out the side of the cavity.
A plunger liqueﬁes pucks of epoxy molding compound using
temperature and/or pressure. The liqueﬁed compound ﬂows
through runner channels into the mold cavity to surround the

die and form the shape of the package. After the compound
solidiﬁes, the molds are released, and the leads are separated
from the remainder of leadframe, which is discarded. The
metal leads protruding from the formed package are now the
pins of the packaged chip that will connect it to a printed
circuit board. Further details on the many packaging styles
for integrated circuits can be found in a popular textbook on
the topic [53].
Several sources of variability in transfer molding can im-
part unique features to a package surface. The mold has a
surface roughness that gets imprinted onto the package. The
surface texture of the mold changes over time as residue ma-
terial accumulates on the mold, and molds require cleaning
to mitigate this build up [25]. Additionally, the molding com-
pound itself, and its curing, contribute a certain amount of
unpredictability. The molding compound is an epoxy that con-
tains a number of ﬁllers including crushed quartz or alumina
that comprise 75% or more of the compound, and provide
thermal conductivity. The size of the ﬁller particles can range
from 20-100µm, and the orientation and distribution of ﬁller
particles in the package is unpredictable. The package during
post-mold curing also experiences shrinkage, cracks, porosity,
and voids [52]. Due to aforementioned variation sources, even
chips packaged in the same mold could have differences in
their package surface.
3 Description of Approach
COUNTERFOIL uses package surface features to authenti-
cate provenance of individual chips as shown in Fig. 2. The
two participants in the scheme that interact with the chip are
denoted as the enroller and a veriﬁer. The enroller acts on
behalf of a chip manufacturer that wishes to sell parts with
an assurance of provenance. The veriﬁer is a customer that

has purchased the chips on the market and wants to check
whether they are legitimate. Both the manufacturer as enroller,
and customer as veriﬁer, have incentives for participating in
the presented scheme. The chip manufacturer can make their
products more attractive by offering an assurance that authen-
tic parts bearing their branding can be veriﬁed as produced by
them. Importantly, they can accomplish this without needing
to trust every point in their distribution channels. The chip
customer is incentivized to participate because systems that
are free from counterfeit chips can avoid costly failures or
recalls that are caused by counterfeits [45].
The enroller extracts ﬁngerprints from package surface
features using image processing and publishes information
about enrolled chips to a public database. Integrity of database
entries is assured by digital signatures. The enroller holds a
private key kpr for signing messages, and gives the corre-
sponding public key kpub to any parties that wish to act as
veriﬁers. Our implementation uses the simplifying assump-
tion of pre-existing public keys for enroller and veriﬁer, but in
practice this could, for example, rely on a trusted certiﬁcate
authority. The enroller uses the private key to sign database
entries when writing them, and the veriﬁer uses the enroller’s
corresponding public key to check the signatures when read-
ing from the database. More details about the enrollment
(Alg. 1) and veriﬁcation (Alg. 2) procedures are given below.
Details of the image processing performed in enrollment and
veriﬁcation are deferred to Sec. 4.

Trusted enroller labels each package and then enrolls it by extracting and then
signing a set of keypoints associated with the package. Veriﬁer compares the enrolled keypoints against the package to determine
whether the package is consistent with its label.
3.1 Enrollment
The enrollment procedure should occur as part of the packag-
ing of an IC. The IC should be trusted at the time of packaging,
as the goal is to later tie provenance back to this point. Each
die is sealed inside of a molded plastic package as usual by
means of transfer molding (see Sec. 2.3 and Fig. 1). After the
package hardens and cures, a label with a computer-readable
identiﬁcation marker is afﬁxed to the surface of the package.
The marker represents an insecure numerical identiﬁer of the
chip instance, similar to a serial number, which we denote as
its eid (enrollment identiﬁer). The enroller then takes an im-
age that captures both the marker, and the package surface in
the vicinity of the marker, from which the ﬁngerprint will be
extracted. A digitized enrollment ﬁngerprint feid is extracted
from the image, using a procedure that will be explained in
Sec. 4.2. The date of manufacture and other metadata can be
appended to the ﬁngerprint at this point. The enroller creates
signature s( feid) by digitally signing ﬁngerprint feid using
private key kpr (Alg. 1, line 3). An entry is added to the pub-
lic database to associate the identiﬁer eid with feid(cid:107)s( feid)
(Alg. 1, line 4). Once the chip is enrolled to the database, it is
released into distribution channels.
