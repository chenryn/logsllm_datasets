User: Is there anyway I can use homewbrew to install packages (like numpy or matplotlib) into isolated virtual environments created using virtualenv, without having the packaged installed system wide.
Assistant: Use pip inside of the virtualenv and it will isolate the packages to just that virtualenv. Each virtualenv has a local version of pip and will install the packages locally.
