I am currently using Symfony 3.0.2 with the following configurations:

- Nginx version: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)
- PHP version: 7.0.3-4+deb.sury.org~trusty+1

The system functions as expected, except when I attempt to access the Symfony profiler. At that point, I receive the following warning message:
```
Warning: session_write_close(): Failed to write session data (user). Please verify that the current setting of session.save_path is correct (/var/www/Symfony/app/../var/sessions/dev).
```
After this, the error persists on every page. To regain normal functionality, I need to delete the session cookie from my browser. The system works fine until I try to enter the Symfony profiler again.

This issue arises only when I add the following line to my Nginx configuration file:
```
fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
```

However, if I use PHP 5 by adding the following line instead, everything works correctly:
```
fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
```

Additionally, I have another project built on Symfony 3.0.1, and it does not exhibit this problem.
