I'm using Symfony 3.0.2 with:  
nginx version: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)  
php version: 7.0.3-4+deb.sury.org~trusty+1
Everything works fine except when I try to enter the Symfony profiler where I
get the following message:
> Warning: session_write_close(): Failed to write session data (user). Please
> verify that the current setting of session.save_path is correct
> (/var/www/Symfony/app/../var/sessions/dev)
After that I get this error on every page. To be able to see regular pages
again I just need to delete session cookie from my browser. But again, it
works fine till I try to enter the Symfony profiler.
This error occurs only when I add to nginx config file this line:
> fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
However, when using php5 by adding the following line everything works fine:
> fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
BTW. I have another project which is build on Symfony 3.0.1, and there is no
such a problem.
