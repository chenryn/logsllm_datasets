Assistant: Use network monitoring tools to monitor server performance and network operating status in real time, and to discover performance problems in time and take preventive measures. You can follow the steps below: 1. Choose the right network monitoring tool: There are many network monitoring tools on the market to choose from, such as Nagios, Zabbix, Cacti, etc. can be selected according to the needs and conditions of the company or individual. 2. Configure monitoring items: According to the conditions of the server and network, configure indicators to be monitored, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, network bandwidth usage, etc., set thresholds for each indicator, and send an alarm when the threshold is exceeded. 3. Monitoring data collection and display: The monitoring tool starts to collect the data of various indicators, and displays them on the monitoring panel in real time, which can be displayed in charts, tables, etc. 4. Alarm mechanism and preventive measures: When an indicator is detected to exceed the preset threshold, the monitoring tool will automatically send an alarm to notify the administrator. The administrator needs to take preventive measures in time to prevent the problem from further expanding its impact. 5. Regularly review monitoring results: monitoring tools can save historical monitoring data, and administrators can analyze the historical data to find out the root cause of the problem and take necessary optimization measures to avoid problems in the future.
