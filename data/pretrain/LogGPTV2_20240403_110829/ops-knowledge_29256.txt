To effectively use network monitoring tools for real-time server performance and network operation status, while also promptly identifying and addressing performance issues, follow these steps:

1. **Select the Appropriate Network Monitoring Tool:** There are numerous options available in the market, such as Nagios, Zabbix, and Cacti. Your choice should be based on your specific requirements, including the size of your organization, budget, and technical expertise.

2. **Configure Monitoring Parameters:** Based on your server and network conditions, define the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be monitored. Common KPIs include CPU usage, memory utilization, and network bandwidth consumption. Set thresholds for each KPI, so that an alert is triggered when a threshold is exceeded.

3. **Collect and Display Monitoring Data:** The selected tool will start collecting data from the defined KPIs and display it in real time through a dashboard. This information can be presented in various formats, such as graphs or tables, for easy interpretation.

4. **Implement Alarm Mechanisms and Preventive Actions:** When a KPI exceeds its set threshold, the monitoring system will automatically notify the administrator via an alarm. It's crucial for administrators to act swiftly upon receiving these alerts, implementing preventive measures to mitigate potential issues before they escalate.

5. **Regularly Review Historical Monitoring Data:** Most monitoring tools have the capability to store historical data. Administrators should periodically review this data to identify trends, pinpoint the root causes of any recurring problems, and take proactive steps to optimize system performance, thereby preventing similar issues in the future.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your network and servers operate efficiently, with any potential disruptions being quickly identified and resolved.
