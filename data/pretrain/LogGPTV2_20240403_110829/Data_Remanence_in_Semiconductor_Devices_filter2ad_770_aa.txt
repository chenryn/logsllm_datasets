Abstract 
A  paper  published  in  1996  examined  the  problems 
involved  in  truly  deleting  data  from  magnetic  storage 
media and also made a mention of the fact that similar 
problems  affect  data  held  in  semiconductor  memory.  
This work extends the brief coverage of this area given 
in 
technical 
the 
background 
to  understand 
remanence  issues  in  semiconductor  devices.    Data 
remanence problems affect not only obvious areas such 
as  RAM  and  non-volatile  memory  cells  but  can  also 
occur  in  other  areas  of  the  device  through  hot-carrier 
effects  (which  change 
the 
semiconductors in the device), electromigration (which 
physically  alter  the  device  itself),  and  various  other 
effects which are examined alongside the more obvious 
memory-cell 
  The  paper 
concludes  with  some  design  and  device  usage 
guidelines which can be  useful in reducing  remanence 
effects.

remanence  problems. 
1. Introduction to Semiconductor Physics 
Electrons  surrounding  an  atomic  nucleus  have  certain 
well-defined  energy  levels.    When  numbers  of  atoms 
are grouped together, the energy levels fall into certain 
fixed  bands  made  up  of  the  discrete  energy  levels  of 
individual  electrons.    Between  the  bands  are  empty 
band  gaps  in  which  no  electrons  are  to  be  found.    A 
band  which  is  completely  empty  or  full  of  electrons 
cannot conduct (for an electron to move it must move to 
a higher discrete energy state, but in a completely full 
band  this  can’t  happen  so  a  completely  full  band  can 
conduct just as little  as a  completely empty one).   An 
electron which is partaking in conduction is said to be 
in  the  conduction band,  which lies  immediately  above 
the valence band. 
At  very  low  temperatures,  the  valence  band  for  a 
semiconductor is full and the conduction band is empty, 
so that the semiconductor behaves like an insulator.  As 
energy  is  applied, electrons move  across the  band gap 
from  the  valence  band  into  the  conduction  band, 
leaving  behind  a  hole  which  behaves  like  a  positive 
charge carrier equal in magnitude to that of the electron 
as shown in Figure 1.  Both the conduction and valence 
bands can conduct (via electrons or holes), producing a 
bipolar (two-carrier) conductor.  In insulators the band 
gap is large enough that no promotion of electrons can 
occur.    Conversely,  conductors  have  conduction  and 
valence bands which touch or even overlap.

Figure 1: Electron behaviour in semiconductors 
In order to make use of a semiconductor, we need to be 
able  to  produce  material  which  carries  current  either 
through electrons or through holes, but not both.  This 
is  done  by  introducing  impurities  (usually  called 
dopants)  into  the  semiconductor  lattice.    For  example 
adding  boron  (with  three  valence  electrons)  to  silicon 
(with four valence electrons) leaves a deficiency of one 
electron  per  added  boron  atom,  which  is  the  same  as 
one  hole  per  boron  atom. 
  Conversely,  adding 
phosphorus  (with  five  valence  electrons)  leaves  a 
surplus  of  one  electron.    Material  doped  to  conduct 
mostly by holes is referred to as p-type; material doped 
to conduct mostly by electrons is called n-type.

Figure 2: P-N junction diode 
The makeup of a simple semiconductor device, the P-N 
junction diode, is illustrated in Figure 2.  This consists 
of an n-type substrate with a p-type layer implanted into 
it.    Protecting  the  surface  is  a  thermally-grown  oxide 
layer which serves to  passivate  and  protect the  silicon 
(this  passivation  layer  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  a 
tamperproof  coating  in  smart  card  vendor  literature).  
The  p-type  layer  is  formed  by  diffusing  a  dopant  into 
the substrate at high temperatures through a hole etched 
into the passivation layer, or through ion-implantation. 
When  such  a  device  is  forward  biased  (a  positive 
voltage  applied  to  the  p-type  layer  and  a  negative 
voltage  applied  to  the  n-type  layer),  current  flows 
through the device.  When the device is reverse-biased, 
very  little  current  flows  (at  least  until  the  device 
breakdown voltage is reached).  The  exact mechanism 
involved is fairly complex, further details are available 
from any standard reference on the topic [1].

specifically 
The semiconductor device used in almost all memories 
and in the majority  of VLSI  devices is the field-effect 
transistor 
the  metal  oxide 
semiconductor FET (MOSFET).  The structure of an n-
channel  MOSFET,  a  standard  building  block  of 
semiconductor memories, is shown in Figure 3.  When 
a  voltage  is  applied to  the  gate,  a  conducting  electron 
inversion  layer  is  formed  underneath  it,  giving  this 
particular device the name of n-channel MOSFET.  The 
n-type  regions  at the  source  and  drain  serve  to supply 
electrons  to  the  inversion  layer  during  its  formation, 
and the inversion layer, once formed, serves to connect 
the  source  and  drain.    Increasing  the  gate  voltage 
increases  the  charge  on  the  inversion  layer  and 
therefore the source-drain current.  Enhancement-mode 
devices  work  in  this  manner,  depletion-mode  devices 
conduct  with  no  gate  voltage  applied  and  require  an 
applied voltage to turn them off. 
Current 
is  dominated  by 
in  MOSFETs 
electron/hole drift, and since electrons are more mobile 
than holes the fastest devices can be obtained by using 
n-channel  devices  which  move  electrons  around.  
Because  there  are  certain  circuit  advantages  to  be 
gained from combining n- and p-channel variants, many 
circuits  use  both  in  the  form  of  complementary  MOS 
(CMOS).    Again,  more  details  can  be  found  in  any 
standard reference [2]. 
2. Semiconductor Memories 
Having covered the basic building blocks used to create 
memories,  we  can  now  go  into  the  makeup  of  the 
memory devices themselves.  In practice we distinguish 
between two main memory types, static RAM (SRAM) 
in which information is stored by setting the state of a 
bistable flip-flop which remains in this state as long as 
power  is  applied  and  no  new  data  are  written,  and 
dynamic RAM (DRAM) in which information is stored 
by  charging  a  capacitor  which  must  be  refreshed 
periodically  as the  charge  bleeds away  (a  later section 
will  cover  EEPROM-based  non-volatile  memories).  
Because  of  their  more  complex  circuitry,  SRAMs 
typically only allow 25% of the density of DRAMs, but 
are  sometimes  preferred  for  their  faster  access  times 
and low-power operation [3]. 
2.1. SRAM 
SRAM  cells  are  typically  made  up  of  cross-coupled 
inverters  using  the  structure  shown  in  Figure  4.    The 
load  devices  can  be  polysilicon  load  resistors  in  older 
R-load  cells,  enhancement  or  depletion  mode 
MOSFETs in an NMOS cell, or PMOS MOSFETs in a 
CMOS  cell  (providing  an  example  of  the  previously 
mentioned  combination  of  n-and  p-channel  MOSFET 
parts in a circuit).  The purpose of the load devices is to 
offset  the  charge  leakage  at  the  drains  of  the  data 
storage and cell selection MOSFETs.  When the load is 
implemented  with  PMOS  MOSFETs,  the  resulting 
CMOS cell has virtually no current flowing through it 
except  during  switching,  leading  to  a  very  low  power 
consumption.

Figure 4: SRAM memory cell 
Operation  of  the  cell  is  very  simple:  When  the  cell  is 
selected,  the  value  written  via  Data/ Data   is  stored  in 
the cross-coupled flip-flops.  The cells are arranged in 
an  n    m  matrix,  with  each  cell 
individually 
addressable.  Most SRAMs select an entire row of cells 
at a time, and read out the contents of all the cells in the 
row along the column lines. 
2.2. DRAM 
DRAM  cells  are  made  up  of  some  device  performing 
the  function  of  a  capacitor  and  transistors  which  are 
used to  read/write/refresh the charge  in the  capacitors.  
Early  designs  used  three-transistor  (3T)  cells,  newer 
ones use a one-transistor (1T) cell as shown in Figure 5.  
Data  is  stored  in  the  cell  by  setting  the  data  line  to  a 
high  or  low  voltage  level  when  the  select  line  is 
activated.  Compare the simplicity of this circuit to the 
six-transistor SRAM cell!

capacitor structure to 3D structures such as trench and 
stacked  capacitors.    The  conventional  storage  time 
(meaning the time during which the cell contents can be 
recovered  without  access  to  specialised  equipment, 
typically 2-4 seconds [4]) for the memory cell is based 
on  storage  capacity  and 
the  physical 
dimensions  of  the  capacitor  [5],  so  that  DRAM 
designers have used various ingenious tricks to keep the 
capacitor storage constant while continuously shrinking 
cell dimensions. 
Most  of the  earlier  4  Mb  cells  used trench  capacitors, 
which  had  the  advantage  that  capacitance  could  be 
increased by deepening the trench, which didn’t use up 
any  extra  surface  area.    Newer  generations  of  trench 
capacitor cells (sometimes called inverted trench cells) 
placed  the  storage  electrode  inside  the  trench,  which 
reduced various problems encountered with the  earlier 
cells  which  had  the  storage  electrode  in  the  substrate.  
There  are  a  large  number  of  variations  possible  with 
this  cell,  all  of  them  based  around  the  best  way  to 
implement  the  trench  capacitor,  with  some  relevant 
examples shown in Figure 6.  The final evolution of the 
trench  cell  stacked  the  transistor  above  the  capacitor, 
reducing  the  total  area  still  further  at  the  cost  of 
increasing

manufacturing process.

in 
The tricky parts of a DRAM cell lie in the design of the 
circuitry to read out the stored value and the design of 
the  capacitor  to  maximise  the  stored  charge/minimise 
the  storage  capacitor  size.    Stored  values  in  DRAM 
cells  are  read  out  using  sense  amplifiers,  which  are 
extremely  sensitive  comparators  which  compare  the 
value stored in the DRAM cell with that of a reference 
cell.    The  reference  cell  used  is  a  dummy  cell  which 
stores a voltage halfway between the two voltage levels 
used in the memory cell (experimental multilevel cells 
use  slightly  different  technology  which  won’t  be 
considered  here).
