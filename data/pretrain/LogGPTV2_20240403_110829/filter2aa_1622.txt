**Key Points from the Talk:**

1. **Email Repudiation:**
   - There is no such thing as repudiating mail.
   - Spammers will always find a way to use your credentials.

2. **Delivery Countermeasures:**
   - Current delivery countermeasures are ineffective and often make things worse.

3. **Content Filtering:**
   - Content filtering is not dead, contrary to popular belief.

**BGP and Prefix Hijacks:**

- **What is BGP?**
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol used to exchange routing information between different networks on the Internet.
  
- **Prefix Hijacks:**
  - **Definition:** Prefix hijacking occurs when an attacker announces IP prefixes that they do not own, effectively making the IPs of others their own.
  - **History:** This technique has been used in the past to social engineer blocks of net-space away from unsuspecting Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) and sell them to private enterprises who were unaware of the theft.
  - **Recent Trends:** In recent years, a new type of prefix hijack has become more prevalent. These hijacks are harder to detect and trace because they last for only about 15 minutes and often come with AS (Autonomous System) prepending.

**Motivations for Prefix Hijacks:**
- NMap the NSA
- P2P MP3 sharing
- DDoS attacks on the RIAA
- Other illegal activities

**How It Works:**
- **Typical Scenario:**
  - An attacker announces a prefix that they do not own.
  - The announcement is propagated through the BGP network, causing traffic intended for the legitimate owner to be routed to the attacker.
- **Detection and Mitigation:**
  - If someone does not play nice, they can be detected and blocked.
  - Clever attackers may use techniques like AS prepending to make detection more difficult.

**Spammers and Netblocks:**
- Spammers do not care about your netblock; they are more interested in using it for their malicious activities.

**IPv4 Space:**
- There is not much unallocated IPv4 space left, which makes the issue of prefix hijacking even more critical.

**Conclusion:**
- Understanding and mitigating BGP prefix hijacks is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the Internet. Effective content filtering and robust countermeasures are essential to combat these threats.
