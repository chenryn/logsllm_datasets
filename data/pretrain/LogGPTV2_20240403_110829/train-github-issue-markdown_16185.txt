### Superset version
Master
### Expected results
One `` tag for each chunk.
### Actual results
There are duplicate `` tags for the shared chunks. If you view page
source, there will be multiple `vendors-addSlice-common-dashboard-explore-
profile-sqllab-theme-welcome.0fe210d7.chunk.js`
For example on the top of the page.
Because each entry in the js manifest lists an array of chunks each entry
point needs, independent of other entry points. When we render this directly
to FAB template, it does not de-dup.
XHR Performance-wise not too bad as browser only fetches and parses once, but
for correctness, if the chunk executes something, it executes multiple times.
### Steps to reproduce
Open Superset, view source.
