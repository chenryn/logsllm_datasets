User: How to perform batch operations on multiple servers, such as adding users in batches, modifying configuration files, etc.?
Assistant: There are many ways to perform batch operations on multiple servers, the following are some of the common methods: 1. Use a scripting language for batch operations. You can use scripting languages such as Bash, Python, etc. to write scripts, and loop through multiple servers and perform corresponding operations in the scripts. 2. Use tools such as Ansible, SaltStack, Chef, etc. to perform batch operations. These tools are configuration management tools that can automatically manage and deploy large-scale servers, and can perform batch operations by defining Playbooks or Recipes. 3. Use the SSH remote command line tool. You can use SSH tools to connect to multiple servers, and then use commands such as for loop or xargs to perform batch operations. 4. Use a cloud management platform. You can use the batch operation function or API of cloud management platforms such as AWS and Azure to perform batch operations. No matter which method is used, it is necessary to ensure that the server has been configured with SSH key authentication before batch operations to avoid frequently entering passwords.
