User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Sharepoint db issue after DB move to SQL 08 Recently we have moved our sharepoint 2007 db from sql 2000 server to 2008 x64 SQL server.
All seems well, however there is a problem where the sql server stops running and the service has to be restarted.
The errors mention insufficient internal memory etc.
I have tried to start the db using -g384 which is the default in sql 2000 but 256 is default for 2008 I believe.
This has not rectified the issue.
I was advised that perhaps the issue may be rectified by upgrading to wss 3.0 sp2 however When I have tried to install this i get another error post sp2 update and have to refer back to a vm snapshot.
The error after the service pack is Server error: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=96177
So I guess I have a few questions How can I fix the first issue and the 2nd issue.
I have checked out many forums and posts and have tried a few things and still get no joy.
Any assistance would be great.

UPDATE
I have fixed the Server error: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=96177 the i needed to run the wss sp2 as well as the office servers sp2 then the config wizard then the moss configuration worked. The errors I am getting in SQL are 

SQL Server was unable to run a new system task, either because there is insufficient memory or the number of configured sessions exceeds the maximum allowed in the server. Verify that the server has adequate memory. Use sp_configure with option 'user connections' to check the maximum number of user connections allowed. Use sys.dm_exec_sessions to check the current number of sessions, including user processes.

A read operation on a large object failed while sending data to the client. A common cause for this is if the application is running in READ UNCOMMITED isolation level. The connection will be terminated. 

There is insufficient system memory in resource pool 'internal' to run this query.

These errors are by a user that was created as a service for sharepoint.

Assistant: I found out that The server was using all of its 4GB of RAM just before the SQL server service stopped.
So I shut it down (it is virtual) added 4 GB of RAM to total 8GB. 
It has been running for 2 days now and not an error in the log.(touch wood)
But I did notice that the serve did reach 4gb of RAM during the time that the outage usually occured.

So I continue to monitor and post results.

This has not fixed the problem.  When I gave it 8 GB sql just used 8GB.

I dont know what else to try. 
Time for a SQL guru I think
