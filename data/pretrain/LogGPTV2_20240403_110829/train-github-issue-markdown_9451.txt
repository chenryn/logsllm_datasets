## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
There are a set of users that really love `alt`+`space`. We overrode that by
default. **Note** the keystroke can be changed in the settings extremely
easily
One idea is to shift to `WinKey`+`space` but this would override the change
localized keyboard shortcut.
Should we change the default for new users to PowerToys? Should this be the
suggested one above?
