Lets say you have the following:
    library example;
    import 'dart:html';
    import "package:angular2/angular2.dart";
    import "package:angular2/src/reflection/reflection.dart" show reflector;
    import "package:angular2/src/reflection/reflection_capabilities.dart" show ReflectionCapabilities;
    main() {
      reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new ReflectionCapabilities();
      bootstrap(MyApp);
    }
    @Component(selector: "my-app", host: const {'foo': 'bar'})
    @View(template: 'hello')
    class MyApp {
    }
It will not set the attribute `foo` onto the `my-app` element that lives in
your html. It does actually set the attribute on a `my-app` element, just not
the one in the dom. It appears there is some sort of temporary element being
created and the attribute is being set on that one.
