Julia currently depends on OpenSSL through libgit2. However, OpenSSL is licensed in a manner that is incompatible with the GPL. This presents a significant issue, as a build of Julia that includes FFTW is subject to the GPL.

One potential solution to this problem would be to use an alternative cryptography library, such as Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS). This would ensure that all components of Julia are compatible with the GPL, thereby resolving the licensing conflict.
