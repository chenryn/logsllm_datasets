Assistant: In a cloud environment, how to automate the deployment and management of system infrastructure to improve efficiency and reduce costs can use the following tools and deployment solutions: Tools: 1. Ansible: use YAML files to write scripts, support SSH execution commands, and can Enable rapid deployment and management. 2. Terraform: Use HCL files to write configurations, automatically create, update, and delete infrastructure, and support multi-cloud providers. 3. Docker/Kubernetes: Use container technology for rapid deployment and management, featuring high availability and elastic scaling. 4. Puppet/Chef: Automates and standardizes provisioning of servers and applications, and automates necessary updates and patches. Scenarios: 1. Docker + Ansible: Use Docker to build application containers, then use Ansible to automate the management of these containers. 2. Terraform + Ansible: Use Terraform to automate the establishment of cloud infrastructure, and then use Ansible to automatically deploy and manage applications. 3. Kubernetes: Use Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications, and use Helm to manage different versions of their applications. 4. Puppet/Chef: Use Puppet or Chef to automate configuration and management of servers and applications. In addition, according to the specific situation, you can choose the tools and deployment solutions that suit you for automatic deployment and management, improving efficiency and reducing costs.
