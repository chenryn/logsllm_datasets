If you've been to a computer security conference recently 
you've no doubt seen people learning how to pick locks and 
crack safes. In the United States, interest in physical security 
has become a natural extension of the growing number of 
people  interested  in  computer  security.  Many  computer 
security events now host some form of lockpicking event, or 
an  area  where  people  can  learn  about  locks,  safes,  and 
methods  to  compromise  them,  commonly  known  as  a 
lockpicking village.
At many of these events attendees focus on techniques to compromise locks and safes without discussing 
the forensic evidence they leave behind. Many instructors and speakers (the author included) portray 
many of these techniques in a manner that leads people to believe that they cannot be detected. In some 
cases this is true, but the vast majority of tools and techniques leave distinct forensic evidence.
This paper describes forensic locksmithing, the field of forensic investigation that relates to lock and 
keying systems. Included in this paper is normal wear and tear, evidence left behind by a variety of entry 
techniques, keying system analysis, and the investigative process.
This paper was written as a companion to my Defcon 17 (2009) talk and does not provide exhaustive 
coverage of the topic. A more thorough resource on forensic locksmithing (and contact information) is 
available at www.lockpickingforensics.com.
Destructive vs. Covert vs. Surreptitious Entry
Before we begin, we need to understand the difference between ways lock or keying systems are 
compromised. Methods of entry are generally classified as being destructive, covert, or surreptitious. 
Essentially, the distinction between them rests on the type of forensic evidence they leave behind. When 
we discuss whether or not methods of entry leave behind forensic evidence we restrict our view to lock-
related evidence. It is quite possible that “forensic-proof” techniques leave behind evidence that is 
unrelated to the locking mechanisms, such as hair, fingerprints, or other trace evidence.
 Destructive entry
  techniques cause damage to or destruction of locks, safes, or surrounding 
components. Surrounding components are commonly doors, windows, and walls. Regular “users” 
of the locking system are capable of identifying destructive entry techniques.
 Covert entry
  techniques are non-destructive and do not leave obvious forensic evidence. They are 
not discovered by regular users, but can be identified by a qualified forensic investigator.
 Surreptitious entry
  techniques are non-destructive and do not leave any discernible forensic 
evidence. Surreptitious techniques are not discovered by regular users, and qualified investigators 
may be unable to identify them, depending on the technique.
In short, the difference between covert and surreptitious entry is the ability for a qualified forensic 
investigator to identify if a tool or technique was used. The paper will cover the most common types of 
covert  and  surreptitious  entry  techniques.  Information  on  destructive  techniques  is  available  at

Forensic Locksmithing
In 1976 a gentleman named Art Paholke (Chicago PD) decided to perform a variety of tests on locks and 
safes to determine whether or not various type of attacks against them left forensic evidence. He 
combined this with an analysis of how different levels of wear affected the evidence. Mr. Paholke's work 
was quite influential and his methods provide the basis for many of the techniques in use today. From his 
work the concept of forensic locksmithing developed.
In modern day, the forensic locksmith assists investigative agencies in criminal investigations, insurance 
claims, and security maintenance by providing the facts surrounding the compromise of a lock or key 
system. In this regard, the forensic locksmith identifies the method of entry, tools used, skill level of 
attacker(s), the relative security of the system, and evidence that may be used to identify suspects. The 
forensic locksmith does not solve cases for the investigative agency, rather they provide facts, evidence, 
and insight that may be used to affect the outcome of an investigation.
Don Shiles, former president of the International Association of Investigative Locksmiths, defines 
forensic locksmithing as:
"The study and systematic examination of a lock or other security device or associated equipment 
using scientific methods to determine if and how the device was opened, neutralized, or bypassed. 
These examinations include the use of various types of forensic techniques, [...] and includes 
microscopic examination, micro photography, regular photography, physical disassembly of the 
device or devices, and on occasion laboratory techniques, such as metallurgy and tool mark 
identification may be conducted."
The forensic locksmith functions much like the traditional crime scene investigator but has extensive 
knowledge of the tools  and  techniques  used to compromise lock and keying systems. With this 
knowledge the investigative agency can better understand and identify potential suspects. In addition to 
this, the forensic locksmith may be asked to provide testimony to explain their findings. In other cases, 
they provide independent testimony to explain or clarify compromise tools and techniques, lock and 
keying systems, and various related topics to a judge or jury.
Normal Wear
In order to identify compromise of a locking system it is important to know what the lock components 
and keys look like when they are used normally.
The amount and nature of the wear on components varies and is highly dependent on the lock, key, and 
component materials. The most common material for pin-tumbler locking cylinders, keys, and 
components is brass. Cylinders and components (pins, levers, wafers, etc) also commonly use nickel-
silver and steel. Keys are made from a wide variety of materials besides brass, such as nickel-silver, 
aluminum, iron, steel, zamak, and various proprietary alloys.
The nature of wear also depends on the design of the key and the components. Unfortunately, I cannot 
display all possible combinations of designs and materials. The following is a microscopic examination 
of different stages of wear on a standard pin-tumbler cylinder (Falcon FA3, 6 chambers, pinned for 5). 
The cylinder, plug, pin-tumblers, and key are all made out of brass. Bottom pins in this cylinder have 
rounded tips. Prior to disassembly, the key to this cylinder was used no more than ten times. For the sake 
of space, I will only show 1-2 pins of each stage, rather than all 5.
Note: Photos are all taken with a digital microscope ranging from 10-200x magnification. 
New
New pins are clean, with no dust, grease, or dirt. Light abrasions and corrosion may exist depending on 
how the pins were stored prior to being used in the lock. Factory original pins usually do not exhibit these 
characteristics. A clear indication that pin has not been used is the fresh milling marks around the tip of 
the pin.
Up close, we notice many small imperfections in the tip of the pin. Very light scratches, dents, and bumps 
are visible. The dents and bumps are natural imperfections in the manufacturing process, while the light 
scratches are likely from the use of a key.
The key for this lock is also new. It is factory original, made of brass, and has been cut with a high speed 
key machine. As stated above, it has been used a few times, and because of this we can see a light track in 
the center of the key where it has picked up lubricant from the pins.
250 Uses
After 250 uses (roughly 3-6 months of use) a ring develops around the pin. This is the key gliding under 
the pins, spread around the tip because insertion and removal lightly rotates them back and forth. The key 
is also lightly polishing the pins, too.
Up close we can see that the ring is actually due to the milling marks starting to be removed and lightly 
polished. The pin has also been slightly distorted in the very center, also due to the key making contact 
with it.
The key has also started to show signs of wear, mostly in the center where the pins have been touching it. 
In this particular case, wear resembles a staircase pattern. In addition, the key has picked up more 
lubricant, making the line on the key considerably darker.
1,500 Uses
At 1,500 uses (roughly 1.5-2 years of use) a distinct change in the appears of the pins. The key has been 
used so many times that the milling marks have almost completely been removed. Again, slight scratches 
on the pin are being caused by the key becoming more jagged as it too wears down.
What is most interesting is that pin 5 (the furthest back) has considerably less wear, and more visible 
scratches. This all makes sense; it is only touched by the tip of the key, and the tip of the key is the most 
worn down because it makes contact with all of the pins.
The key continues to wear and collect lubricant. Image shown at high zoom to show the literal pits that 
are being created. At this point, certain ramps on the key may be acting like a file when going in and out 
of the lock. As seen above, this translates to more light scratches on the tips of the pins.
5,000 Uses
At 5,000 uses (roughly 5-6 years of use) the front pin (left) has no milling marks, and almost all scratches 
have been polished away. From this point on wear looks similar to this, with light markings sometimes 
being created by wear of the key.
Compared to other pins, pin 5 (center) continues to show reduced signs of wear and retain its milling 
marks. We can also now see that wear is not evenly distributed on this pin, as it resembles an oval shape. 
Compare with above picture and 1,500 use pictures.
They key (right) continues to wear down, with small craters from the previous example now very large 
and uneven. Slight imperfections like this in the key will cause light, seemingly random scratching on the 
soft brass on the pins. Stronger key materials may even act as a file against pins.
The face of a lock that has seen moderate to heavy use will have many dents and imperfections caused by 
normal use. How many times have you went to unlock a door and slightly missed the keyway? In the 
photo (left), many small dents and scratches from normal use are visible.
In shoulder stopped locks (almost all pin-tumbler locks qualify), continued use will cause light impact 
marks along the face of the plug (right). This is normal, and should not be confused with the extreme 
material displacement that occurs during key bumping.
Lockpicking
Lockpicking is a general term for a wide variety of covert entry techniques, all of which attack the 
locking components directly. Unlike impressioning or decoding, lockpicking attempts to open the lock 
without producing a working key or decoding the correct position of components. There are many 
different lockpicking tools for various lock types.
In almost all cases of lockpicking two tools are used. A tension tool is used to gently apply tension to the 
lock, and a pick is used to position components. As tension is applied to the plug, bolt, or other 
component, locking components will bind in some way. The pick can be used to determine which 
component is binding and then used to position it properly. The correct position of a component is known 
by the attacker through feedback in the form of touch, sound, or sight. The tension tool holds properly 
positioned components in place, and the attacker repeats the process. Once all components are properly 
positioned the lock can be unlocked or locked.
The nature of lockpicking necessitates that strong materials be used for tension and picking tools. Tools 
are commonly made out of steel, iron, and aluminum. Tools are thin (on average 0.025'' with pin-tumbler 
picks) and require a medium amount of force to move locking components. When contacting the softer 
brass or nickel-silver of locking components, pick and tension tools leave marks in the form of gouges 
and scratches. The best source of forensic evidence of lockpicking are on the components themselves, but 
the lock housing, bolt, and cam may also be examined, depending on the type of lock.
Forensic Evidence
The act of using a pick tool is invasive, and we expect the stronger material of the pick tool to cause 
marks on the softer brass or nickel-silver of the lock components. In the photo (left), we see scratches 
where the pick tool was used to lift the pin. These appear to be single-pin picking marks due to their 
shape, size, and position.
This photo (center) is similar to the last, but instead there are many varied, elongated scratches at 
different angles and depths on the pin. This type of marking is indicative of a pick that is designed to be 
gently rubbed against the pins at varying height and tension. Of course, this is the technique known as 
raking or rake picking.
In this photo (right), marks left appear to be a combination of both picking techniques. Many attackers 
will attempt to lightly rake as many pins as possible and then proceed to use single-pin picking against 
the rest. This may be necessary in the case of security pins that are triggered while raking, also.
The marks left by an attacker are in many ways indicative of their skill level. In this photo (left), deep and 
plentiful pick marks are shown. The attacker, an amateur, used extreme force on both tension and pick 
tools. The extreme tension causes pins to bind against plug and require more force to be lifted.
In this photo (center), pick marks are extremely light but still visible in the center of the pin. We can also 
see some marks on the side of the pin which are more defined. This is a very skilled attacker who uses 
extremely light tension and picking force to reduce forensic evidence. Despite much higher picking skill, 
we still find similar forensic evidence.
In other cases, marks may be light due to stronger materials being used for components. In this photo
