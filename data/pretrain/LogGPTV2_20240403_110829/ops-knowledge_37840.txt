User: When I try to use cron to execute my python script in a future time, I found there is a command at, AFAIK, the cron is for periodically execute, but what my scenario is only execute for once in specified time.
and my question is how to add python script to at command,
also it there some python package for control the at command
My dev os is ubuntu 10.04 lucid,and my product server is ubuntu-server 10.04 lucid version.
in fact, I want through python script add python script tasks to at command, which file's change can effect at command add or remove new jobs
Assistant: type man at, it will explain how to use it. Usage will slighty differ from system to system, so there's no use to tell you here exactly.
