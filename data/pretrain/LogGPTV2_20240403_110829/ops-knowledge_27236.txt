User: I need to be able to switch back and forth between Python 2 and 3. How do I do that using Homebrew as I don't want to mess with path and get into trouble.
Right now I have 2.7 installed through Homebrew.
Assistant: I thought I had the same requirement - to move between Python versions - but I achieved all I needed with only Python3.6 by building from source instead of using homebrew.

Depending on the repo, check if there is MAKE file already setup for this option.
