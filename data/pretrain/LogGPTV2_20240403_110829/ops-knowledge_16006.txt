User: Please introduce common methods of database backup and recovery, and explain their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Database backup and recovery are important measures to protect database security. Commonly used backup and recovery methods include: 1. Full backup: save the backup of the entire database in a backup file, including data and metadata. The advantage is that the backup and recovery speed is fast, but the disadvantage is that the backup and recovery files are too large and need to be performed regularly. 2. Incremental backup: Only back up the changes that have occurred since the last full backup, which can save backup time and space. The advantage is that the backup file is smaller, and the disadvantage is that multiple backup files need to be restored at the same time when restoring. 3. Differential backup: Back up all changes since the last full backup and the last backup. Compared with incremental backup, the backup file is smaller, but a full backup and a recent differential backup file are required for recovery. 4. Online backup: Backup is performed during the running of the database without suspending the database service, but it may affect the performance of the database. 5. Offline backup: backup when the database is closed will not affect the performance of the database, but the service needs to be suspended. 6. Hot backup: save the backup file in another device or location, so that the database can be restored quickly when it fails. The advantage is that it enables fast recovery, the disadvantage is that backup files require space and require an efficient backup and recovery strategy. The above are common backup and recovery methods, which need to be selected according to specific business needs.
