3.3 Injecting Uncertainty into Packet Traces
Wireless service providers regularly sell data plans that
connect mobile devices to the Internet. The J-standard spec-
iﬁes that intercepted IP packets should be mirrored to law
enforcement agencies (LEAs) without modiﬁcation in con-
tent wiretaps. Below, we identify three techniques that pre-
vent the reliable reconstruction of IP ﬂows.
Confusion
Confusion has been previously proposed as
a method of injecting false information into the transcripts
of Internet eavesdropping systems [8]. By injecting specially
crafted IP packets that are intercepted by the eavesdrop-
per but are never received by the receiving party (e.g., a
web or email server), wiretap subjects hinder the accurate
reconstruction of actual communication.
The eavesdropping subject may apply a number of tech-
niques to cause spurious chaﬀ to be accepted by the wiretap
but dropped by the network before reaching the receiver.
For example, she may use packet TTLs that are insuﬃcient
to reach the receiver, produce packets whose sizes exceed a
hop’s MTU, or specify IP options that cause packets to be
dropped by intermediary Internet routers [8, 24].
Internet eavesdroppers can be located at various positions
in the network: near the sender, near the receiver, at routers
along the path joining the communicating parties, or in the
case of colluding eavesdroppers, some combination of the
above. Reliably confusing Internet monitoring systems is
diﬃcult since it requires precise knowledge of the locations
of all interception points. Generally, such information is not
known to the eavesdropping target.
By providing the subject with the location of the inter-
ception point, the wiretap architecture proposed in the J-
standard makes it signiﬁcantly easier to conduct confusion
attacks. Given the wiretap’s location, the subject can more
accurately construct messages (e.g., with small TTLs) that
will be recorded by the wiretap but dropped before reaching
the receiver.
To verify the feasibility of conducting confusion attacks,
we transmitted specially crafted confusion packets on Sprint’s
cdma2000 data network to a server running on our institu-
tion’s network. Packets were constructed using the hping
packet assembler tool [26] running on a laptop connected
to Sprint’s network via a Sierra Wireless Compass 597 EV-
DO modem. We veriﬁed that the cdma2000 network routed
packets with arbitrary TTLs and with the Congestion Win-
dow Reduced (CWR) and ECN-Echo (ECN) TCP ﬂags set.
By specifying suﬃciently small TTLs, we were able to pro-
duce routable packets that did not arrive at the receiver but
would be perceived by the wiretap.
Subject-Originated cdma2000 Timestamps Each IP
packet is enveloped within a cdma2000InterceptionofContent
LAESP message before being transmitted to the LEA. Along
with the IP packet’s payload, the LAESP message includes
a timestamp of when the IP packet was intercepted. The
timestamp is not required if the underlying protocol (the
J-standard lists RTP [27] as an example) includes timing
information in the protocol header.
CALEA systems that rely on application-layer protocol
headers to convey timing information are vulnerable to ma-
nipulation. The subject can send messages with erroneous
date information, aggravating LEA’s ability to accurately re-
construct ﬂows. Additionally, the subject may specify times-
tamps that are outside of the dates speciﬁed in the wiretap
order, potentially forcing the disqualiﬁcation of such records
in court proceedings.
Loss of cdma2000 Direction Information
cdma2000InterceptionofContent messages contain an op-
tional ﬁeld that indicates the direction of the IP packet (that
is, towards or away from the wiretap subject). If cdma2000
messages do not use the direction ﬁeld and are transmitted
over a combined CCC (carrying both inbound and outbound
packets), the LEA must discern the sender and receiver of in-
tercepted messages using network addresses speciﬁed in the
IP header. A subject could exploit the lack of directional-
ity information and generate forged IP packets purportedly
from another party to the subject, hence inserting arbitrary
and non-existent communication into the wiretap transcript.
3.4 In-band Signaling within the Service Provider
Network
As an optional feature,
intercept access points (IAPs)
may communicate hook status (whether or not the line is
in use) to the Delivery Function (DF) using in-band signal-
ing. When the subject’s line is not in use, the IAP transmits
a “C-tone” (a two frequency audio signal consisting of 852Hz
and 1633Hz) to the DF. Upon detection of C-tone, the DF
releases the CCC and transmits a CCClose message on the
CDC [3], causing LEA equipment to stop recording.
A subject can exploit the use of in-band signaling and ap-
ply C-tones during her conversation to avoid being recorded.
Since the DF cannot distinguish between C-tones produced
by the IAP or by the wiretap subject, the subject can disrupt
the wiretap at will by playing C-tones, even at low volume,
over her conversations.
In a previous paper [28], we noted a similar vulnerability

in pre-CALEA “loop extender” wiretap systems.
systems, the telecommunications service provider (TSP) trans-
mits hook status information to the LEA using in-band sig-
naling over the same voice channel used to relay the content.
519In loop extender systems, recording equipment located at
the LEA stops recording (and mutes the speaker) whenever
it detects the presence of C-tone, regardless of whether the
C-tone originated from the TSP or from the wiretap sub-
ject [28]. In contrast, the design of J-standard CALEA sys-
tems should eliminate the use of in-band signaling between
the TSP and the LEA (since signals are sent out-of-band via
the CDC).
In CALEA systems, ironically, the problem appears to be
much worse: in-band C-tone signaling may be used not just
at the link between the TSP and law enforcement (where
the vulnerability can be more easily mitigated on the law
enforcement side), but also internally within the TSP’s de-
livery network. That is, if a surveillance subject applies
C-tone on a link tapped by CALEA equipment designed in
this way, the CCC between the TSP and the LEA simply
closes (as if the call terminated normally) and no content is
delivered at all. Worse, nothing the LEA equipment does
by itself can detect or mitigate such an attack; it can only
be ﬁxed at the TSP side.
3.5 Content Leakage
In the case of a pen register only tap, US law requires
that no call content be delivered to the LEA. However, many
telephony features make separating call-identifying informa-
tion from content a non-trivial task. The problem is even
murkier in IP telephone networks since both signaling infor-
mation and digitized audio are sent over the same channel
and often within the same packets.
Merely excluding CCCs from delivery in pen register taps
does not necessarily remove all content delivered to the law
enforcement agency. For example, content is delivered via
the CDC when intercepting SMS messages. In the publicly
available TSP literature [16, 1, 4] and in patents for wire-
less interception devices [9], the content of SMS messages
is transmitted via PacketEnvelope messages on the CDC.
Neither the J-standard nor any of the vendor implementa-
tions attempt to separate SMS content from SMS identifying
information. If an LEA receives any information about an
SMS message, it receives the entire message as well.
Additionally, the transmission of post cut-through dialed
digits (i.e., digits dialed after call completion) via the CDC
is another instance of content leakage. We are aware of no
technology that can accurately discern whether post cut-
through digits belong to another phone number or (for ex-
ample) a bank account and PIN.
The communication of any content to LEAs over the CDC
in the absence of a content warrant may be in violation of
US law. In particular, while there is not yet a general con-
sensus, courts are beginning to aﬃrm that post cut-through
digit extraction constitutes content and may therefore not
be provided in pen register wiretaps [29, 21].
3.6 Legacy Attacks
For completeness, we brieﬂy describe in this section the
vulnerabilities in CALEA systems that have been previously
identiﬁed in the literature.
Confusion and Evasion Dialing
In pre-CALEA loop
extender wiretap systems, separate DTMF decoders resid-
ing at the telecommunications service provider (TSP) and
the law enforcement agency (LEA) are respectively used to
route calls and record telephone numbers dialed by intercept
subjects. Since the same analog DTMF tone is decoded by
two distinct systems that inevitably have slightly diﬀerent
tolerances, a wiretap subject may generate DTMF tones at
the edge of acceptable ranges that are interpreted by one
decoder and not by the other.
In previous work [28], we
demonstrate that the wiretap subject can confuse the wire-
tap by generating DTMF tones that are accepted by the
wiretap while being ignored by the switch (e.g., by varying
pitch, amplitude, etc. of the tones). Similarly, the subject
may evade detection by producing tones that are acceptable
to the switch but are ignored by the loop extender system.
Post-loop-extender CALEA systems utilize intercept ac-
cess points (IAPs) located within switching hardware to
record the TSP’s decodings of DTMF tones. At ﬁrst blush,
the J-standard architecture appears to thwart confusion and
evasion dialing since LAESP messages contain the switch’s
interpretations of DTMF tones. However, a target of a
CALEA wiretap can circumvent her TSP by using a third-
party service (for example, a calling card service) to route
calls. Typically, a user of such services speciﬁes the called
party’s telephone number using post cut-through DTMF
tones. Although the call is subject to wiretap, the TSP does
not have direct access to the third-party’s interpretation of
the post cut-through DTMF digits.
CALEA attempts to mitigate such wiretap circumvention
attempts by decoding post cut-through digits and reporting
their interpretations via DialedDigitExtraction messages.
As with loop extender systems, the device used to decode
DTMF tones for the wiretap is independent of the system
that interprets the tones to route calls, allowing the sub-
ject to use confusion and evasion techniques to insert false
records into the wiretap transcript.
In-band Signaling on the CCC Pre-CALEA loop ex-
tender wiretap systems utilize in-band signaling to convey
hook status. When the phone is on-hook (not in use), DTMF
C-tone is applied to the connection between the TSP and the
LEA. Loop extender systems stop recording when C-tone is
detected, regardless of whether the DTMF tone is produced
by the TSP or by the subject.
CALEA systems based on the J-standard do not use in-
band signaling between the TSP and the LEA. Instead, call-
identifying information is sent via a physically separate CDC
channel. Provided that TSP switches do not relay hook sta-
tus information using in-band signaling to the DF (creat-
ing the vulnerability described in Section 3.4), the subject
should not be able to manipulate the CALEA wiretap by
applying C-tones.
However, as noted in our original study [28], CALEA ven-
dor literature and related patents describe C-tone on the
CCC as an optional feature to control audio recording equip-
ment at the LEA [10, 13, 14, 19, 25]. CALEA systems may
apply C-tone to CCCs to inform LEA equipment that the
subject’s phone is on-hook. If the LEA equipment relies on
the presence or absence of C-tone on the CCC to discern
hook status, the subject can easily control the recording
equipment and wiretap log seen by law enforcement.
4. PRACTICAL ATTACK SCENARIOS
Using easily obtainable equipment, a subject can conduct
unilateral attacks against virtually all TSP services, causing
either gaps in wiretap transcripts or the recording of inaccu-
rate information. Below, we describe several practical attack
520scenarios in which the wiretap target can evade monitoring
and/or inject uncertainty into call records.
• A target with a mobile data service installs an application
on his smartphone that continuously generates UDP con-
nections to one or more Internet sites. The resultant Pack-
etDataPacketFilter LAESP messages saturate the CDC.
Since Origination messages that indicate subject-initiated
calls consequently do not reach the LEA, the target may
place calls that do not appear in the wiretap’s call records.
Similarly, CCOpen messages may be lost (in the case of con-
tent wiretaps), preventing the LEA from associating a CCC
with the call, enabling the target to communicate via voice
and data without being monitored.
• A wiretap subject with wireline and mobile services con-
ducts the above UDP ﬂow attack using his smartphone to
saturate the CDC. Since the same CDC is used to con-
vey signaling information for both the wireline and mobile
services, the target may place unmonitored calls using his
wireline phone.
• A VoIP subscriber wiretap target uses a scriptable soft-
phone or call generation tool (e.g., SIPp) to rapidly place
VoIP calls to his voicemail service. Operated by the TSP,
the voicemail service does not require traversal of the tradi-
tional wireline telephone network. To maximize his signal-
ing rate while limiting the resources required by the voice-
mail system, calls are immediately disconnected after they
connect. Since the signaling capacity of the wiretap tar-
get vastly exceeds that of the CDC, the target exhausts
the resources of the CDC connection. Call records and call
content pertaining to the subject’s legitimate incoming and
outgoing calls are not recorded due to CDC congestion.
• A mobile data service subscriber installs an application on
her smartphone that sends a superﬂuous packet with small
TTLs before each legitimate packet. As most TCP re-
assemblers discard packets with previously seen sequence
numbers (even if their contents diﬀer) [8], the wiretap re-
constructs the target’s chosen chaﬀ rather than the legiti-
mate traﬃc. In contrast, since the receiver is located fur-
ther from the sender than the wiretap, the receiver does
not receive the chaﬀ traﬃc with small TTLs. Manual in-
spection of wiretap logs may reveal the target’s duplicity,
but without knowledge of the precise network topology at
the time of interception, the LEA cannot deﬁnitively recon-
struct traﬃc ﬂows.
• A wireline, mobile, or VoIP subscriber produces C-tones
at low amplitudes during the duration of her calls. Due
to the use of in-band C-tone signaling within the TSP, the
TSP’s Interception Access Point (IAP) produces CCClose
