I just initiating with sklearn it is a great library and the best, the
documentation is awesome.
But, not for the first time, a cannot access any links in SourceForge:
> The sourceforge.net website is temporarily in static offline mode.  
>  Only a very limited set of project pages are available until the main
> website returns to service.
I urge you to move the documentation to elsewhere possibly to GitHub Wiki or
GitHub pages.
