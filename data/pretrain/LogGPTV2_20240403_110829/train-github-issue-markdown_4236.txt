I am just starting to use `sklearn`, and I find it to be an excellent library with fantastic documentation. However, I have encountered an issue where I am unable to access any links on SourceForge. The message I receive is:

> "The sourceforge.net website is temporarily in static offline mode. Only a very limited set of project pages are available until the main website returns to service."

I strongly recommend moving the documentation to a more reliable platform, such as GitHub Wiki or GitHub Pages. This would ensure that users can always access the documentation without interruptions.
