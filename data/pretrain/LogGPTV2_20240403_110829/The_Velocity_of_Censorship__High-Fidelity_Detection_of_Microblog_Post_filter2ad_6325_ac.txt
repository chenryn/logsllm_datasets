Figure 1: Lifetime histograms. (a) and (b) are the life-
time histograms of all system deletions. (c) and (d) are
the lifetime histograms of regular text-only posts. (a)
and (c) show the histogram of the whole lifetime, (b)
and (d) only show the ﬁrst two hours of the lifetime
histogram.
To demonstrate how long a post survives before it gets
deleted, we analyze the system deletion data set (see Sec-
tion 3.3). Figure 1 gives us a big picture of how fast the
Weibo system works for censorship purposes. The x axes
are the length of the lifetime divided into 5-minute bins,
and the y axes are the count of the deleted posts hav-
ing the lifetime in the corresponding bin. We note that
these ﬁgures have the distinctive shape of a power law or
long tailed distribution, implying that there is no partic-
ular time bound on Weibo’s censorship activity, despite
the bulk of it happening quickly, and that metrics like
mean and median are not as meaningful as they are in a
normal distribution.
We can see that the post bins with small lifetimes are
large. We zoom into the ﬁrst 2 hours of data, which is
plotted in Figure 1 (c) and (d). This tells us that system
deletions start within 5 minutes, the same as text-only
regular posts. For both of them, the modal deletion age
appears to be between 5–10 minutes.
In our data set, 5% of the deletions happened in the
ﬁrst 8 minutes, and within 30 minutes, almost 30% of
230  22nd USENIX Security Symposium 
USENIX Association
the deletions were ﬁnished. More than 90% of deletions
happened within one day after a post was submitted. This
demonstrates why a measurement ﬁdelity on the order of
minutes, rather than days, is critical.
Considering the big data set that Weibo has to process,
the speed, especially the 5 to 10 minutes peak, is fast,
especially considering that the data cannot be processed
in a fully automated way. How can the Weibo system
ﬁnd sensitive posts and remove them so quickly? On
the other hand, the long tails suggest that sensitive posts
can still be deleted even after an extended period. How
are those sensitive posts located by the moderators after
a month in their huge database? What factors affect a
post’s lifetime?
In this section, to ﬁnd the answers to these questions,
we propose four hypotheses and then test them against
our data. Hypotheses 1 and 2 try to explain how the speed
of censorship on Weibo can be so fast. Hypothesis 3 ex-
plains why we see the long tails of the post lifetime for
censored posts in Figure 1. Hypothesis 4 tells us that the
deletion speed does not appear to be strongly related to
particular conversation topics, but rather to popular top-
ics (i.e., those that are being discussed on Weibo as a
whole according to our public timeline) where our core
sensitive users are putting a spin on the discussion that
involves themes of government power (see Section 5).
4.1 Post lifetime regression
Before we give our hypotheses, we ﬁrst consider what
factors affect a post’s lifetime, regardless of the content
of the post.
For each post, besides the basic information about the
post itself, we also see an embedded picture, if present,
as well as a parent post identiﬁer, if it is a repost. Also,
we know the number of followers and friends of each
user, as well as of any parent post’s user.
From the graphs in Figure 1, we decided to experi-
mentally ﬁt a negative binomial regression to it to see
which factors affect the lifetime of a post. Table 1 and
Table 2 show the results for the regular posts and child
posts, respectively. Three asterisks (‘***’) indicates sta-
tistical signiﬁcance, one asterisk (‘*’) indicates a coefﬁ-
cient that is not statistically signiﬁcant, and no coefﬁcient
is indicated with a dash (‘-’). We can regress the log life-
time for a regular post or a child post via:
+ b2(Friends #) +b 3(Posts #)
Regularlifetime) =Intercept + b1(PHasPic)
ln(¤(cid:30)
ln(⁄(cid:30)Childlifetime) =Intercept + b1(PHasPic)
+ b2(P.Friends #) +b 3(P.Posts #)
We examine the effect on post lifetime of: the exis-
tence of a picture, the number of friends and followers,
and the number of posts sent by this user. We found that,
for both regular and child posts, the existence of a pic-
ture affects the post’s lifetime the most. That is, posts
with pictures have shorter lifetimes than posts without
pictures. Some of the user attributes, such as number of
friends or number of posts, also affect post lifetime. We
note that the coefﬁcients for these are relatively small,
but for users with large numbers of friends or who write
large numbers of posts, these factors can have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on the speed of that users’ posts being
censored. However other attributes of a user, such as
whether a Weibo user is “veriﬁed” by Weibo (i.e., Weibo
knows who they are as part of newer Chinese require-
ments that crack down on pseudonyms unconnected to
real world identities) or the number of followers of a user,
are not statistically signiﬁcant factors in a post’s lifetime.
