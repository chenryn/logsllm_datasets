Hello Everyone,
I am a newbie to Electron (Atom-shell), Was figuring out the api provided in
ATOM shell. While doing mock up codes. I was unable to find any api to
retrieve cookies and delete specific cookies for domain.
Am i missing something, can someone put me in a right direction.
    Mac : ~/Library/Application Support//Cookies i deleted all were gone.
    windows : appData//cookies 
deletion will delete everything But is there any api to collect all Cookies
and manage selective domains to delete them? or can we enable
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/cookies api
BTW, I just love the architecture and way atom is working embedding CEF and
Node
Cheers!!!!!
