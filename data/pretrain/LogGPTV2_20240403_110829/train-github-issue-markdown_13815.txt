Please refer to the following code snippet in the Elasticsearch repository:

```java
// https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/metadata/MetaData.java#L1150
```

In this part of the code, if an element in the cluster state is not recognized, it is simply ignored. 

For clarity and context, you may want to provide a brief explanation or background on why this behavior is important or how it affects the system. For example:

"In the Elasticsearch cluster metadata handling, any unrecognized elements in the cluster state are ignored. This ensures that the system remains robust and can handle unexpected or outdated data without failing, maintaining overall stability and reliability."
