### Title: Active Watermark Cancellation in Video Streaming Services: Ensuring a Seamless Viewing Experience

**Abstract:**

Live video streaming services have gained significant popularity in China, leading various service providers to implement visible watermarks to protect their content. However, these watermarks, which are often large and obtrusive, have become a source of frustration for both content creators and viewers.

In this study, we explore the feasibility of active watermark cancellation, where content creators can pre-embed a reverse watermark in their video stream to neutralize the service provider's watermark. Although the concept is straightforward, several challenges arise in implementation, including issues related to size, position, and shadow effects.

We begin by providing a theoretical estimation of the achievable limits using computer graphics theory. To validate our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept (PoC) against one of the largest video streaming service providers in China, which is also listed on the NYSE. The results were highly promising, with nearly 100% active cancellation of watermarks after resolving issues related to color management and color space conversion.

To facilitate the automation of this process, we developed an FFmpeg filter and an OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) plugin. These tools enable real-time adjustments with a short training sequence of frames during live broadcasting, thereby enhancing the watermark cancellation effect.

Furthermore, we identify and discuss several existential risks associated with watermarks that cannot be actively canceled:
- **Transform Attack:** Transforming one watermark into another provider's.
- **Code Rate Jitter Attack:** Adding high-frequency components to force the video codec to reduce the code rate near the watermark.
- **Frame Squeezing Attack:** Sacrificing some resolution by squeezing the screen and then restoring it with user-defined JavaScript to bypass the watermark.

We provide corresponding examples and propose security countermeasures to mitigate these risks, ensuring a more seamless and enjoyable viewing experience for users.
