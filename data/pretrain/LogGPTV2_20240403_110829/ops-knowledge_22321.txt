User: How to configure a new router so that it can provide Wi-Fi network service while protecting network security?
Assistant: Here are the steps to configure a new router: 1. Confirm your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and prepare the information provided by your ISP, such as username and password. 2. If your router has a default administrator username and password, please change these information immediately before logging into the router for the first time. 3. Connect to the router and open your network settings page. Enter the IP address of the router and the administrator username and password to log in. 4. After logging in, find "Wireless Network Settings" in the router settings interface, enable Wi-Fi and set your network name (SSID) and password. Choose a strong password that includes a combination of alphanumerics and symbols. 5. Enable encryption protection. Secure your Wi-Fi network with at least WPA2 encryption. WPA2 encryption provides the highest level of security, ensuring your network cannot be accessed by unauthorized users. 6. Turn off WPS. WPS is a common protocol for quickly setting up Wi-Fi devices, but it can also be exploited by hackers. So to be safe, please turn off the WPS function. 7. Set up a guest network. If you want to use Wi-Fi for visiting guests, it is recommended to set up a private guest network. This prevents unauthorized access while protecting your own and your family members' personal devices. 8. Update your router firmware. Over time, router manufacturers roll out new firmware and patch updates to address potential security issues and network vulnerabilities. Please update your router firmware regularly to keep your network safe. The above are the common steps to configure a new router, these steps can protect the security of your Wi-Fi network and prevent some security threats.
