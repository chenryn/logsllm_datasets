title:blackhat:us-19 Ghidra - Journey from Classified NSA Tool to Open Source
This year was a momentous one for the National Security Agency (NSA) as we released our game-changing software reverse engineering (SRE) framework to the open source community: Ghidra. This was a long and arduous process and we want to give Black Hat attendees a chance to hear from two of our experts on how we developed Ghidra, what the tool does, and the process to release it to the public. We will also share some of the insight into what it is like for NSA researchers to interact with the dynamic nature of an open source toolâ€¦ and the social media attention that it attracts.
