### Inter-Video Navigation

While the previous section examines the number of videos loaded from a given page, it is also valuable to explore the transitions between video views. To achieve this, we sort each user session in chronological order of access, focusing solely on video accesses. We then identify transition points as the shifts from one resource request to the next. Figure 6 presents a Sankey diagram that illustrates these transitions. Our findings indicate that the majority of sessions (92.6%) involve transitions between resources on the same page type. For example, 92.6% of homepage video accesses are followed by another video access from the homepage. This trend is consistent across most pages. For the top 5 accessed pages, at least 88.83% of video transitions occur within the same source as the previous video. This observation suggests a significant opportunity for predictive pre-fetching of content.

### Discussion and Implications

Our work has several implications, particularly for optimizing Content Delivery Network (CDN) delivery. Here, we focus on the potential benefits of geo-aware caching.

#### Geo-Aware Caching

CDNs aim to improve the quality of service while managing overheads, typically measured by cache hit rates and deployment costs. Our results confirm that, although images constitute the bulk of requests, the majority of data delivered is video content. Given the presence of highly popular objects, there is potential for edge caching of content. Despite the existing global deployment of cache servers by CDNs, we explore the possibility of deploying a larger number of geo-aware caches.

Using city tags derived from Maxmind, we cluster users into cache domains based on their geographic location. This approach creates a wider dispersal of cache servers compared to typical CDN deployments [2]. We then subdivide users into their respective cities, filtering out any cities with fewer than 10 sessions, leaving 385 cities. For simplicity, we assume each region has its own dedicated geo-cache.

We first compute the number of sessions in each city that consume the same video. Figure 7(a) shows the results on a per-video basis. Unsurprisingly, accessing the same video within a city is common. In the most extreme case, one video was accessed by 98.9% of all sessions in a particular city. This leads us to hypothesize that such properties could be exploited for caching. Figure 7(b) illustrates the percentage of traffic that could be saved (Y-1 axis) if a city-wide cache were deployed. Assuming the cache covers all users in the city and has unlimited storage for the one-hour period of the dataset, savings exceeding 90% are feasible. The Y-2 axis shows the percentage of videos that have at least 3 user sessions within a city, indicating a high potential for savings, with nearly all cities exceeding 50%.

#### Predictive Loading

The above findings confirm that caching is an effective tool in this domain. We also suggest that more innovative approaches could further streamline delivery. For instance, predicting popular video chunks and pushing them could enhance the Quality of Experience by reducing perceived delays. This would be especially useful since videos are often not viewed contiguously, making current buffering strategies less effective. Predicting the next skip could avoid wasted buffering. Additionally, the heavy load created by thumbnails suggests they could be pre-loaded in bulk for certain videos. We have confirmed that sessions exhibit clear behavioral patterns when moving between video pages. These patterns could be predicted and exploited. For example, the top video in a recommendation pane could be pre-loaded, similar to Accelerated Mobile Pages [15]. Given the tendency for viewers to select such content, it might even be possible to dynamically recommend videos based on what content is live in the nearest cache. This approach could satisfy user demand while reducing network costs for the CDN.

### Conclusion

This paper explores the characteristics of a large adult video portal, focusing on in-session journeys. We first examined the corpus and workload served by our vantage point. Contrary to expectations, the bulk of objects served are image content, although video accounts for the majority of bytes delivered. Most video requests were for a small subset of the content, confirming past observations about the skewed distribution of adult content. This led us to focus on session-level behaviors, revealing distinct access patterns and evaluating the potential of caching and pre-fetching to optimize delivery.

This work is just the first step in our research agenda. We have studied journey patterns within sessions but wish to better understand why these patterns emerge. This generalizes beyond adult video to any type of website. Therefore, we plan to conduct comparative research with other portals. With these patterns, we aim to develop optimized delivery systems that can predict and pre-load content per-user. Finally, we are eager to delve deeper into the innovations discussed and perform further experiments to understand how they can streamline delivery.
