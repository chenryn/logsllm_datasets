Inter Video Navigation. Whereas the above inspects the number of videos
loaded from a given page, it is also interesting to explore the transition of views
between videos. To compute this, we sort each user session into its temporal
order of access. This only covers video accesses. We then compute transition
points as the move between one resource request to the next. Figure 6 presents
a Sankey diagram to reveal the transition of accesses between videos. We ﬁnd
that the majority of sessions move between resources on the same page type. For
example, 92.6% of accesses to the homepage of a video are followed by another
video access from the homepage. This observation generalizes across most pages.
For the top 5 accessed pages, we ﬁnd at least 88.83% of videos are accessed
from the same source as the previous video. We conjecture that this may be a
powerful observation for performing predictive pre-fetching of content.
6 Discussion and Implications
There are a number of implications of our work. Here we brieﬂy focus on potential
work in relation to optimizing CDN delivery.

and checking the previous resource request to determine the step-by-step journey.
Geo-Aware Caching. CDNs are primarily interested in improving their qual-
ity of provision, as well as overheads. This is typically measured via metrics such
as cache hit rate vs. deployment costs. Our results conﬁrm that, even though
images constitute the bulk of requests, the majority of bytes delivered are video
content. Furthermore, due to the presence of highly popular objects, we posit
that there may be potential for edge caching of content. Although CDNs already
deploy cache servers around the world, we next test the possibility of deploying
a larger number of geo-aware caches.
As we do not have topological information about clients, we cluster users into
a cache domain based on their city tags derived from Maxmind. Note that this
creates a wider dispersal of cache servers compared to most CDNs [2]. We then

sub-divide users into their cities, and ﬁlter any cities that have 10 or fewer ses-
sions, leaving 385 cities. For simplicity, we assign all users in each city into a single
caching domain, assuming that each region has its own dedicated geo-cache.
We ﬁrst compute how many sessions in each city consume the same video.
Figure 7(a) presents the results on a per-video basis. Unsurprisingly, we ﬁnd that
accessing the same video from a city is commonplace. In the most extreme case,
one video is accessed by 98.9% of all sessions within a particular city. This leads
us to hypothesize that such properties could be exploited for caching. Hence,
Fig. 7(b) shows the percentage of traﬃc that could be saved (Y-1 axis) if a city-
wide cache were to be deployed. Note, for simplicity, we assume the cache covers
all users in the city and has unlimited storage for the one hour period of the
dataset. For these high population locations, savings exceeding 90% are feasible.
The Y-2 axis also presents the percentage of videos that have at least 3 user
sessions within a city accessing them (i.e., thereby resulting in a saving). We see
that these are extremely high, with nearly all cities exceeding 50%.
Predictive Loading. The above conﬁrms that caching is an eﬀective tool in this
domain. We also posit that a number of more innovative approaches could be taken
for streamlining delivery. For instance, predicting popular chunks in the video
and subsequently pushing them could improve Quality of Experience by reduc-
ing human-perceived delays. This would be particularly useful, as often videos are
not viewed contiguously, making current buﬀering strategies ineﬀective. Predict-
ing the next skip could therefore avoid wasted buﬀering. Furthermore, the heavy
load created by thumbnails, suggest they could perhaps be pre-loaded in bulk for
certain videos We have also conﬁrmed that sessions have clear behavioral traits
when moving between video pages. Again, we conjecture that these patterns could
be predicted and exploited. For instance, the top video within a recommendation
pane could be pre-loaded, much as we see done with Accelerated Mobile Pages [15].
In fact, due to the propensity for viewers to select such content, it might even be
possible to dynamically select which videos to recommend based on what content
is live in the most nearby cache. We posit that this may be able to satisfy user
demand, whilst also reducing network costs for the CDN.

7 Conclusion
This paper has explored the characteristics of a large adult video portal, with
a focus on understanding in-session journeys. We ﬁrst inspected the corpus and
workload served by our vantage point. We found that, contrary to expectation,
the bulk of objects served are actually image content, although video does make
up the bulk of bytes delivered. In terms of videos, the majority of requests were
for a small subset of the content, and we conﬁrmed past observations related to
the skewed distribution of adult content. This led us to focus on session-level
behaviors, where we revealed distinct access patterns and brieﬂy evaluated the
potential of caching and pre-fetching to optimize delivery.
The work constitutes just the ﬁrst step in our research agenda. We have
so far studied the journey patterns within sessions, however, we wish to better
understand why these patterns emerge. This generalizes beyond adult video to
any type of website. Thus, we wish to do further comparative research with other
portals. With these patterns, we also wish to develop optimized delivery systems
that can learn behavior suﬃciently well to predict and pre-load content per-user.
Finally, we are keen to deep dive into the innovations discussed, and perform
further experiments to understand how they can streamline delivery.
