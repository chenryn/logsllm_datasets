Most tasks and processes we undertake involve the use of some kind of tool. The better you understand how to use these tools, the more efficient you will become. The more frequently you use a particular tool, the more worthwhile it is to invest time in improving your proficiency with it.

Whenever I use a tool, I always consider whether there are ways to configure or utilize it that could make my work easier or faster. However, it's important not to get carried away and attempt to change everything at once. Instead, take it one step at a time. Once you have fully internalized an improvement, move on to the next. This methodical approach ensures that each enhancement is effectively integrated into your workflow.
