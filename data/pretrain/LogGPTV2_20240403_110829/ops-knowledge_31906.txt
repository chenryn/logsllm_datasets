User: I have used os.system(command) in a for loop.
By using this, CMD opens, executes the command and close. For Second command, CMD opens again, executes tha command and close. Due to this, CMD pop-ups again and again.
Meanwhile, I am not able to do another task on system. I want to do this in a CMD so that i can minimize it and continue with other task.
Assistant: You can just concatenate your commands, delimited by a semicolon (;) and only call os.system once.
