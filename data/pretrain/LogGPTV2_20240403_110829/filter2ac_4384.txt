**ATT&CK ID:** T1104  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Multi-Stage Channels

Adversaries may employ multi-stage command and control (C2) channels to facilitate their operations under varying conditions or for specific functions. This approach can obscure the C2 communication, making it more challenging for defenders to detect and analyze the malicious activities. By using multiple stages, adversaries can add layers of complexity and redundancy, thereby increasing the resilience and stealth of their C2 infrastructure.
