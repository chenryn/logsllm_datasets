**Title: BlackHat US-18: Strengthening Hyper-V Through Offensive Security Research**

Virtualization technology is increasingly becoming the backbone of security strategies for modern computing platforms. Microsoft's Hyper-V, a key player in this domain, adheres to stringent security standards, as evidenced by its $250,000 public bug bounty program.

As expected, Microsoft's engineers continuously search for vulnerabilities within their products. More intriguingly, Microsoft also develops exploits for these vulnerabilities to better understand the techniques involved and mitigate them before they can be exploited by malicious actors. In this presentation, we will explore how Microsoft's Offensive Security Research (OSR) team undertook this approach with Hyper-V. Specifically, we will discuss the discovery of CVE-2017-0075, the development of novel exploitation techniques, and the subsequent contributions to Hyper-V hardening efforts. The talk will provide a detailed walkthrough of each step, culminating in a live demonstration of the "Hyper-Pwning" exploit.
