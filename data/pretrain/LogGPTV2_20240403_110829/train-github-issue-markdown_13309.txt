## Feature request
When outputting content targeting the `web` platform, it would be nice to have
the option to output an es module for modern browsers. (I don't believe there
is currently a way to do this - if there is it needs better documentation :P).
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Ideally, I would like to be able to have webpack output two entry files, an
esmodule as well as what it currently outputs.  
Then in the `index.html` file, both files can be loaded like this:
**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**  
Supporting the modern web.
**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**  
Maybe something like this:
    // webpack.config.js
    const config = {
      //...
    };
    const webConfig = Object.assign({}, config, {
      target: 'web',
      //...
    });
    const webModuleConfig = Object.assign({}, config, {
      target: 'web-module',
      //...
    });
    module.exports = [
      webConfig, webModuleConfig,       
    ];
**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**  
Maybe but probably not. I'm still a novice when it comes to the webpack eco-
system so I'd probably be at a loss on how to implement this.
