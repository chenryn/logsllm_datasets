ABSTRACT
A longstanding problem with the Internet is that it is vulnerable to
outages, black holes, hijacking and denial of service. Although ar-
chitectural solutions have been proposed to address many of these
issues, they have had difﬁculty being adopted due to the need for
widespread adoption before most users would see any beneﬁt. This
is especially relevant as the Internet is increasingly used for appli-
cations where correct and continuous operation is essential.
In this paper, we study whether a simple, easy to implement
model is sufﬁcient for addressing the aforementioned Internet vul-
nerabilities. Our model, called ARROW (Advertised Reliable Rout-
ing Over Waypoints), is designed to allow users to conﬁgure reli-
able and secure end to end paths through participating providers.
With ARROW, a highly reliable ISP offers tunneled transit through
its network, along with packet transformation at the ingress, as a
service to remote paying customers. Those customers can stitch
together reliable end to end paths through a combination of par-
ticipating and non-participating ISPs in order to improve the fault-
tolerance, robustness, and security of mission critical transmissions.
Unlike efforts to redesign the Internet from scratch, we show that
ARROW can address a set of well-known Internet vulnerabilities,
for most users, with the adoption of only a single transit ISP. To
demonstrate ARROW, we have added it to a small-scale wide-area
ISP we control. We evaluate its performance and failure recovery
properties in both simulation and live settings.

other cases, outages are not just an inconvenience, they are poten-
tially life threatening. Similarly, an economically important case is
presented by the outsourcing of enterprise IT infrastructure to the
cloud – connectivity outages to cloud servers can imply high costs
due to disruptions of day-to-day business activities.
However, the present Internet is not up to the task. For example,
router and link failures can trigger convergence delays in the Bor-
der Gateway Protocol (BGP). When combined with conﬁguration
errors on backup paths, outages can last for hours up to days [14].
Often these outages are partial or asymmetric, indicating that a vi-
able path exists but the protocols and conﬁgurations are unable to
ﬁnd it. Other triggers of outages: required maintenance tasks such
as software upgrades and policy reconﬁguration, router misconﬁg-
uration, massive botnet denial-of-service attacks, router software
bugs, ambiguities in complex protocols, and malicious behavior by
competing ISPs. Even if the trafﬁc is delivered, there are other vul-
nerabilities. Recently, intra-US trafﬁc was intentionally re-routed
through Belarus [6], and earlier, trafﬁc from the US Department
of Defense was routed through China [35]. The Internet lacks any
protocol mechanism to prevent this type of event from recurring.
Because of its scale, the Internet is of necessity multi-provider,
and routes often involve multiple organizations. While a number of
research projects have proposed tools to diagnose problems (e.g.,
[14, 16]), and ﬁxes to speciﬁc issues, such as preﬁx hijacking [5,
17,21,23], route convergence [13], and denial-of-service [7,26,38],
there has been little progress towards deployment except in a few
cases. Part of the problem is incentives. Many of the proposed
solutions are only truly valuable if every ISP adopts; no one who
adopts ﬁrst will gain any advantage.
Another part of the problem is completeness. Is there a set of
ﬁxes that together would mean we could trust the Internet to reli-
ably deliver packets with reasonable latency? For example, Secure
BGP addresses some of the vulnerabilities surrounding spoofed
routes, but it doesn’t address denial of service or route convergence.
The commercial case for deploying a partial defense is weak.
We note that reliability is not equally important for all trafﬁc.
Our goal is to design a system that will provide highly available
communication for selected customers as long as there is a pol-
icy compliant physical path, without diverting the trafﬁc to non-
trustworthy ISPs. This property should hold despite node and link
failures, software upgrades, byzantine behavior by neighboring net-
works, and denial-of-service attacks by third parties.
In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate a system
called Advertised Reliable Routing Over Waypoints (ARROW) that
allows ISPs to sell reliability and security as a service, without
widespread adoption happening ﬁrst. End users can obtain this ser-
vice from any ISP offering it, including ISPs that do not face end-
users and primarily serve the backbone of the Internet. At the core
of our system is a protocol to provision a tunnel across a remote
ISP; packets entering the tunnel are authenticated by the ISP, deliv-
ered to a speciﬁc exit PoP, and slightly re-written, e.g., to modify
the destination address. In providing ARROW, an ISP promises
only what it can guarantee itself: a high quality tunnel across its
own network. The customer is responsible for stitching together
ARROW into an end-to-end solution. Like local transit, ARROW
is paid for by the requestor, arranged over the web in much the
same way as one would purchase computing cycles in Amazon’s
EC2 cloud computing service.
ARROW shares similarities with Detour routing [29], the Inter-
net Indirection Infrastructure [31], Nira [37], pathlet routing [10],
and Platypus [27], among others. Unlike these earlier systems, the
ARROW model takes into account resource exhaustion and byzan-
tine attacks in addition to routing anomalies; experience has shown
that these attacks are common. More importantly, a number of tech-
nology trends have converged to merit a fresh look at Detour-like
systems for addressing Internet reliability:
• Large-scale ISPs have deployed sophisticated trafﬁc and net-
work management, making their own networks much more re-
liable. How can we best leverage this for end-to-end resilience?
• The Internet has become ﬂatter and is more densely intercon-
nected [20]. This has shortened BGP paths to the point that
a single, well-placed tunnel is often sufﬁcient to avoid a wide
range of problems (as we show in §5).
• $5K PCs can cost-effectively process packets at Internet speeds
(40Gbps), allowing for easy deployment of ARROW and the
applications that build upon it.
In this paper, we present the design of ARROW, including how
its main requirements, incremental deployability, high availability,
and robustness, are achieved (§3). We present the ARROW API
that can be used by ISPs and end-users to ﬁnd, reserve, and es-
tablish paths on the Internet (§3.2). We present our implementa-
tion of ARROW and describe its deployment on a faux ISP that
we control, including several applications we have built on top of
this deployment (§4). Finally, we evaluate ARROW both in sim-
ulation and experimentally (§5). Our evaluation shows ARROW’s
resilience against transient routing problems, IP preﬁx-hijacking,
inter-AS link failures, path performance problems, and ISP fail-
ures, with little overhead to Internet routing performance.
2. MOTIVATION
Consider the following example scenarios.
Example 1: Imagine a healthcare monitoring application that op-
erates over the Internet. The patient wears a monitoring device
sending measurements to a data center, where they are analyzed
in real-time. Anomalies are forwarded to alert human experts who
can ensure that no medical problem has occurred. To support such
applications the network must provide high availability because the
network may be part of a life-critical medical feedback loop with
timeliness constraints. It must also provide desired levels of quality
of service, i.e., provide high bandwidth streams with low loss rates.
These services should not be disrupted by transient changes in un-
derlying paths either due to cross-trafﬁc or due to BGP dynamics.
Example 2: A large enterprise that is physically distributed across
multiple sites, such as a Fortune 500 company, needs to use the
Internet for inter-site communications, serving its customers, and
accessing outsourced IT services in the cloud. It might have mul-
tiple requirements for its communications: trafﬁc should be com-
municated reliably even in the presence of outages, there should
be no information leakage due to trafﬁc analysis, and trafﬁc should
be robust to security attacks such as preﬁx hijacking. To address
these concerns, it wants to ensure that its trafﬁc only traverses a
set of pre-approved, trustworthy providers or a predictable set of
ISPs that satisfy certain geographical/jurisdictional requirements.
This is impossible to guarantee today. Near the source, an ISP can
select BGP routes to a speciﬁc destination that obey certain restric-
tions. However, those routes can be changed by the downstream
ISPs without pre-approval or prior notice; BGP will inform the up-
stream users only after the fact. Near the destination, the ISP has
no standard way to signal that it should only be reached through
pre-approved paths or through a predictable set of trusted ISPs.
The previous examples highlight just a few problems of Internet
use for mission-critical services. A recent survey [32] enumerates
other known security vulnerabilities of the Internet. A few exam-
ples include disruption of service by resource exhaustion attacks
against network links and end hosts, preﬁx hijacks by malicious
ISPs, and byzantine errors by neighboring ISPs (e.g., intentional
disaggregation of addresses, causing router crashes).
Even without vulnerabilities to malicious attack, the Internet pro-
tocols are operationally fragile: Internet paths are often disrupted
for short periods of time as BGP paths converge. Common opera-
tional changes, such as reboots or rewiring, and divergence between
the control and data plane can also reduce availability. With today’s
protocols, an endpoint has no recourse in this case but to patiently
wait for the problem to be repaired.
In our work, a key observation is that the amount of trafﬁc for
mission-critical applications can be quite small, especially com-
pared to normal everyday Internet use. Yet this trafﬁc is often very
high value. Our proposal targets just these low-volume, high value
applications. Most users ﬁnd most of their Internet trafﬁc works
well enough most of the time, because much of the trafﬁc on the
Internet is for content delivery from nearby cached copies. For this
type of trafﬁc, the most critical factor is the reliability of the local
ISP. Internet reliability is of course still an issue for many users,
but it seems unlikely that this part of the problem requires an archi-
tectural ﬁx beyond designing better tools for network operators to
diagnose their own networks.
Our focus is thus on developing a system that can enhance the re-
liability and performance of mission-critical trafﬁc using solutions
that are incrementally deployable and provide beneﬁts even when
it is deployed by a small number of ISPs. Further, re-architecting
the Internet from ground up seems overkill for such a small amount
of trafﬁc, no matter how important in human or commercial terms.
Given the large number of known problems, it is unlikely that even
a well-designed set of changes would ﬁx every problem, and a mas-
sive change to the Internet protocol suite would run the risk of hav-
ing unintended side effects.
3. ARROW DESIGN
We would like to develop a simple system that can be used to
provide highly available communication in addition to the Inter-
net’s normal uses as long as there is a usable and policy-compliant
physical path between a pair of endpoints. To this end, the key
requirements of our solution are:
Incremental Deployability: In today’s Internet, a provider ISP (or
ISPs) mediates Internet service. This poses a chicken and egg prob-
lem: an ISP can’t promise or charge for a new type of service unless
all, or almost all, other ISPs already provide the service. We want
to make it possible for end users, enterprises, and governments to
leverage reliable intradomain paths made available by remote ISPs,
without requiring global adoption of new protocols.
pate in the protocol. ARROW beneﬁts from a network effect, but it
still provides value to enterprises and data centers needing to con-
trol routes even if only a few ISPs have adopted the approach. In
the example in Figure 1, ARROW is still useful to PowerData even
if Sprint does not provide ARROW transit.
Second, ARROW aims to require only modest changes to the ex-
isting Internet infrastructure to facilitate deployment. We assume
no changes to normal trafﬁc, but we do require that mission criti-
cal trafﬁc be specially encoded to simplify packet processing at the
router. Redesigning services to work with ARROW requires min-
imal programmer effort, the costs of which should be outweighed
by the beneﬁts for mission-critical services. Alternately, we explain
how a local ISP could offer an end to end service to its clients, by
rebundling their mission critical trafﬁc to use ARROW.
In the rest of this section, we present the ARROW design and
outline the key components of our proposal including:
• the management interface for setting up transit through a re-
mote ISP,
• the data plane operations required for supporting remote transit,
• the issues in setting up end-to-end paths, monitoring them, and
responding to changes in path quality, and
• business considerations that affect the adoption of the proposed
scheme.
3.2 Setting up Remote Transit
An ISP offering ARROW advertises its willingness to provide
its transit, for a fee, via SSL, much as is currently done for cloud
providers offering computer time. The control trafﬁc (to ﬁnd out
about advertised ARROW tunnels, and to request the tunnel) can
be carried over the existing Internet, or in turn use ARROW mech-
anisms to bootstrap more reliable routes that can be used for the
contol trafﬁc.
The ISP operates a portal that provides interested users with an
interface for obtaining information regarding its ARROW service.
If transit is granted for a fee, registering with an ISP’s service would
typically involve an exchange of the customer’s credit card infor-
mation. An ISP can exercise ﬁne-grained control over its ARROW
