I have both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 installed on my Windows machine, located at `C:\Python27` and `C:\Python35-32`, respectively. Both directories are included in the System Path environment variables, allowing me to access them from any directory.

I successfully created a virtual environment using Python 3.5 in a sub-directory named `CODING_LABS`. I then configured my Eclipse Python interpreter to point to the `python.exe` file within this `CODING_LABS` virtual environment. However, when I run my script from Eclipse, it still uses Python 2.7. I am unable to determine why this is happening.

**Assistant:**

It sounds like the default Python interpreter in Eclipse is set to Python 2.7. By default, any run configuration will use the first interpreter listed in the Preferences. You can check and reorder these interpreters by going to:

- **Preferences > PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter**

Here, you can use the up/down buttons to change the order of the interpreters, making your desired interpreter (in this case, the one in `CODING_LABS`) the default.

Additionally, you can configure a different interpreter for each project. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select the project.
2. Press `Alt + Enter` to open the project properties.
3. Navigate to **PyDev - Interpreter/Grammar > Interpreter**.
4. Choose the appropriate interpreter for that specific project.

You can also specify a different interpreter for each launch configuration:

1. Go to **Run > Run Configurations**.
2. Select the launch configuration you are using.
3. In the **Interpreter** tab, choose the desired interpreter.

Finally, ensure that the paths in the interpreter configuration window (found in **Preferences > PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter > select interpreter**) correctly map to the expected site-packages and external libraries. This will help avoid any issues with missing or incorrect library references.
