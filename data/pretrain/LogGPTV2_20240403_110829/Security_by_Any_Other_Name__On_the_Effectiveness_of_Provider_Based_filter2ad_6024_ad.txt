for mail submission, however the certiﬁcate offered by this server
has the common name *.hotmail.com and no subjectAltName.
On the delivery side, we found that a number of providers, includ-
ing Hotmail and Yahoo!, sent mismatched certiﬁcates.
5.1.2 Web interface
All of the 22 select providers offered a Web mail interface, how-
ever, three (163.com, libero.it, and daum.net) did not offer
TLS support. Among the top 10 providers, all except qq.com and
comcast.net required SSL/TLS to access Webmail.
Certiﬁcates. All certiﬁcates used for HTTPS were matching and
valid. This is not surprising, given the intimidating warnings is-
sued by modern browsers for mismatched certiﬁcates. The fail-
ure to check for matching certiﬁcates by MUAs likely explains the
large number of mismatched certiﬁcates used by MSAs and MDAs.
5.2 Inside the Provider
Once submitted to a mail provider, a message may transit a num-
ber of internal servers before reaching the outgoing MTA. We do
not have visibility into internal message processing, so our mea-
surements are based on information given in the Received headers
(Section 4.7). Using these, we reconstructed the use of TLS inside
the 22 select providers on the outgoing and incoming path (labeled
(b) and (d) in Figure 1).
Table 3 shows our results. The Outgoing column shows inter-
nal hops on the outgoing (MSA to outgoing MTA) path and the
Incoming column shows internal hops on the incoming (incoming
MTA to MDA) path. Each mark represents a hop: (cid:73) indicates TLS
was used, (cid:66) indicates TLS was not used, and ·
indicates that a
non-standard protocol was used. Yahoo! appears to use a protocol
called NNFMP internally. It is not publicly documented, and we
do not know if it uses TLS. Some providers had multiple routes a
message could take, in this case we favored the route with the most
hops.
Overall, TLS use on internal hops is not widespread. (We empha-
size that internal hops may be on the same local network, or may be
carried on an inter-datacenter VPN.) Incoming message paths are
much shorter, and in some cases, record no hops at all. None of the
incoming message paths appeared to use TLS.
456Providers which report no hops from the MTA to MDA such as
web.de may be using the same host for both the MTA and MSA,
or may not be recording the internal hops to the message headers.
5.3 Provider-to-Provider
The hop between providers, from outgoing to incoming MTA,
uses SMTP. In the absence of provider-to-provider peering, mes-
sages along this hop will transit the public Internet. It is perhaps
here that the risk of mass trafﬁc interception is greatest. As dis-
cussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we use the behavior of the outgoing
and incoming MTAs when communicating with us to infer how
they might behave when communicating with each other. Because
of the manual effort required, we evaluated outgoing MTA behav-
ior for select providers only. For incoming MTAs, we used the top
1 million domains representing 245,054 distinct providers in 2015
(266,323 in 2014). We then combine these to form a picture of mes-
sage paths between select providers and the full set of providers.
5.3.1 TLS Support at Outgoing MTAs
Email providers. The ﬁrst column in Table 6, labeled CONTROL,
shows the use of the STARTTLS command by provider outgoing
MTAs when contacting our server. The vertical headers are the ﬁrst
character of the sending provider. The (cid:35) mark indicates TLS was
not used, (cid:32) indicates that TLS was used in both scans (March
2014 and February 2015), and % indicates that TLS was used in
the February 2015 scan but not in the March 2014 scan. (There
were no cases of TLS being used in 2014 but not 2015 among the
select providers.) The top 10 providers all used TLS when offered
in 2015.
Other generators. We also examined outgoing MTA TLS support
of major Web services (Section 4.1.3) in March 2014. These results
are shown in Table 4, grouped by category. Note that some names
appear in Table 6 and Table 4 with a different level of TLS support
indicated. These are services offer both mail and non-mail services.
Table 6 shows TLS support for outgoing MTAs used by the mail
service, while Table 4 shows TLS support for outgoing MTAs used
by the site’s user account system. For example, yandex.ru is both
a mail provider and a popular Web portal. Registering an email
account (not necessarily a @yandex.ru account) with the site will
generate email relayed by an outbound MTA that does not use TLS.
Support for TLS on outgoing MTA links was highest among
the ﬁnancial institutions we examined. All but USBank’s outgo-
ing MTA supported TLS. The lowest level of support was among
news and dating sites. The latter, in particular, is surprising, given
the personal nature of the emails.

5.3.2 Certiﬁcate Checking at Outgoing MTAs
As described in Section 4, we performed the experiment sev-
eral times, offering different certiﬁcates to the outgoing MTA each
time it connected. We found that all but three providers, wp.pl,
comcast.net, and hotmail.com, did not perform any certiﬁcate
checking. (For space reasons, results are not presented in tabular
form.) In particular, all but those three accepted a revoked, ex-
pired, self-signed, mismatched certiﬁcate with a weak signature
(sha1WithRSA 512 bit). The outgoing MTAs for hotmail.com,
wp.pl, and comcast.net rejected our certiﬁcate only because it
was expired. Remedying this, their outgoing MTAs accepted the
revoked, self-signed, mismatched, weak certiﬁcate.
5.3.3 Outgoing MTA Client Certiﬁcates
For each connection from an outgoing MTA, we also recorded
the client certiﬁcate provided by the MTA during TLS negotia-
tion. (Our server was conﬁgured to request it.) 7 of the 22 select
providers returned a client certiﬁcate for our request. Of these, only
one, from comcast.com, was expired or otherwise invalid.
5.3.4 TLS Support at Incoming MTAs
Select providers. The top row in Table 6, labeled CONTROL, shows
support for TLS at the incoming MTA for the 22 select providers. It
is surprising to see that more providers support sending with TLS
than receiving with TLS. However Google’s TLS data discussed in
more detail in Section 6 shows that 7 of the providers we observed
not sending with TLS do use TLS with Google.
Other providers. As described in Section 4.2, we also tested the
incoming MTAs of the providers for the top 1 million domains in
the Adobe leak. Among these 302,938 MTAs (covering 245,054
providers), 50.5% supported TLS in March 2014, increasing to
54.6% in February 2015. Among the top 1000 providers, support
for TLS increased from 43.7% to 59.2%.
