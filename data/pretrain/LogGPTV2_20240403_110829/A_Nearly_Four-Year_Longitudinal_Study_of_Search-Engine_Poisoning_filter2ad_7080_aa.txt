ABSTRACT
We investigate the evolution of search-engine poisoning using data
on over 5 million search results collected over nearly 4 years. We
build on prior work investigating search-redirection attacks, where
criminals compromise high-ranking websites and direct search traf-
ﬁc to the websites of paying customers, such as unlicensed phar-
macies who lack access to traditional search-based advertisements.
We overcome several obstacles to longitudinal studies by amalga-
mating different resources and adapting our measurement infras-
tructure to changes brought by adaptations by both legitimate op-
erators and attackers. Our goal is to empirically characterize how
strategies for carrying out and combating search poisoning have
evolved over a relatively long time period. We investigate how
the composition of search results themselves has changed. For in-
stance, we ﬁnd that search-redirection attacks have steadily grown
to take over a larger share of results (rising from around 30% in late
2010 to a peak of nearly 60% in late 2012), despite efforts by search
engines and browsers to combat their effectiveness. We also study
the efforts of hosts to remedy search-redirection attacks. We ﬁnd
that the median time to clean up source infections has fallen from
around 30 days in 2010 to around 15 days by late 2013, yet the
number of distinct infections has increased considerably over the
same period. Finally, we show that the concentration of trafﬁc to
the most successful brokers has persisted over time. Further, these
brokers have been mostly hosted on a few autonomous systems,
which indicates a possible intervention strategy.

INTRODUCTION
Web trafﬁc is valuable. By their ability to connect large num-
ber of users with online retailers, web search engines and social
networking sites have seen their valuation skyrocket, and have be-
come indispensable actors in the advertising industry.
The potential for monetizing web trafﬁc has not been lost on
more questionable businesses. Counterfeit goods, dubious ﬁnan-
cial products and, of course, unlicensed pharmaceutical drugs have
long been available online; but the key change in recent years stems
from the way these products are advertised. Spam email, once the
main method to introduce less-than-reputable businesses to poten-
tial consumers, has been shown to be relatively ineffective [11].
As a result, email spam has seen increased competition from web-
based advertising.
Of course, illicit or fraudulent businesses do not have the lux-
ury of simply purchasing ads from major advertisers. For instance,
Google paid $500 million to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. De-
partment of Justice for accepting advertisements from unlicensed
pharmacies [3]. The company now has safeguards in place to pre-
vent accepting such ads.
Instead, a viable alternative for those
shut out of legitimate search advertising is to compromise web-
sites, and then have them conspire to promote the desired prod-
ucts in response to certain queries. Figure 1 shows an example in
which the top two results obtained for the query “cheap viagra”
are compromised websites. The top result is the website of a news
center afﬁliated with a university. The site was compromised to
include a pharmacy store front in a hidden directory: clicking on
any of the links in that storefront sends the prospective customer to
pillsforyou24.com, a known rogue Internet pharmacy [19].
There are many variants on this basic idea. Certain compromised
sites are conﬁgured to automatically send their visitors to different
pharmacies depending on the type of query being issued; others
simply contain spam links. The main takeaway is that compromis-
ing vulnerable websites to advertise illicit businesses appears to be
a lucrative strategy and thriving practice.
Such search-engine result “poisoning” has been getting increased
attention from the research community, that has attempted to mea-
sure and describe speciﬁc campaigns [10, 20, 29], infection tech-
niques [2, 15], or even economic properties [16, 21]. Most of the
aforementioned studies tend to either describe phenomena observed
on relatively short time-spans (e.g., presenting “search-redirection
attacks” observed over a few months [15]), or to describe longer-
term activities of speciﬁc actors (e.g., speciﬁc pharmaceutical afﬁl-
iate networks [21], or a particular search-engine optimization bot-
net [29]).
In this paper, we combine multiple data sources, some used in
our previously published work, and some the fruit of new mea-
surements, to gain insights into the long-term evolution of search-
engine poisoning. With a primary focus on how unlicensed phar-
macies are advertised, we analyze close to four years (April 2010-
September 2013) of search-result poisoning campaigns. We do not
focus on a speciﬁc campaign or afﬁliate network, but instead an-
alyze measurements taken from the user’s standpoint.
In partic-
ular, we study what somebody querying Google for certain types
of products would see. While we focus here on Google due to
their dominance in the US web search market [4], previous work
(e.g., [2]) showed other search engines (e.g., Yandex) are not im-
mune to search-result poisoning.
Contributions of the study. Our study has three primary objec-
tives, which also deﬁne our contributions. First, we describe the
relationship between attackers’ actions and defensive interventions.
We are notably interested in identifying the temporal characteristics
of attackers’ reactions to defensive changes in search-engine algo-
rithms. Second, we aim to determine whether, over a long enough
interval, we can observe changes in attitudes among the victims.
For instance, are compromised sites getting cleaned up faster in
2013 than they were in 2010? Have defenders been trying to tar-
get critical components of the infrastructure search-result poisoning
relies on? Third, we want to better understand the long-term evo-
lution of the thriving search-poisoning ecosystem, notably in terms
of consolidation or diversiﬁcation of the players.
2. RELATED WORK
There has been a wealth of recent research on search-engine
abuse. For instance, Levchenko et al. [17] focus primarily on email
spam, but also provide some insights on “SEO” (search-engine op-
timization) by people involved in the online trade of questionable
products. A follow up work by the same group [21] analyzed the
ﬁnances of several large pharmaceutical “afﬁliate networks” and
provided evidence that search-result poisoning accounted for a non-
trivial part of the trafﬁc brought to these pharmacies.
Closer to this paper, a number of measurement studies have been
dealing with observing the effect of search-result poisoning. Leon-
tiadis et al. [15], Lu et al. [20], John et al. [10] and Wang et al.
[29] describe various campaigns that involve either search-result
poisoning or “search-redirection attacks” where a malicious party
compromises websites both to take part in link farming in an at-
tempt to game search-engine ranking algorithms, and to automat-
ically redirect trafﬁc coming to these compromised websites. For
instance, someone searching for “vicodin no prescription” could
see a top result with a link to a university’s parking services web-
site; clicking on the link would result in the compromised website
sending a HTTP 302 redirect message back, which would take the
user to a different site; after a couple of such automatic redirections,
the user would typically land on a pharmaceutical webpage. Mean-
while the administrators of the victimized website might not even
notice something is amiss, if the malicious software installed on
the server redirects only when the visitor is coming from a search-
engine, with drug-related terms in their query.
While originally the compromised sites participating in search-
redirection attacks did little more than simply send HTTP 302 redi-
rects, they have evolved toward more complex and evasive forms
of redirection, apparently in response to deployed defenses from
search engines. For instance, in a follow-up paper to our original
search-redirection measurements, we have described how a more
modern variant of search-redirections uses cookies to store state, in
order to look innocuous to web crawlers while still actively redi-
recting users behind a “real” browser [16]. We also explain that
attackers increasingly host “store fronts” under hidden directories
in the compromised webserver as shown in Figure 1 (second re-
sult). Borgolte et al. [2] describe more recent advances in redirect-
ing techniques, in particular JavaScript injections that are particu-
larly hard for crawlers to detect. Li et al. [18] describe techniques
to detect these JavaScript injections, and show that such injections
often are used to support a peer-to-peer network of compromised
hosts distributing malware.
Coming from a different angle, a recent paper by Wang et al. [28]
explores the effect of interventions against search-poisoning cam-
paigns targeting luxury goods, both by search-engine providers who
demote poisoned results and by brand-protection companies en-
forcing intellectual property law by seizing fraudulent domains.
Different from the previous work, we believe to be the ﬁrst to
look at data on such a large scale and over a long time period. This
in particular allows us to observe trends in how attackers and de-
fenders have been adapting to each others’ strategies over the years.
3. BACKGROUND
Conceptually, there are three distinct components to a successful
search-redirection attack [15]: Source infections are sites that have
been compromised to participate in a search-redirection campaign.
Their owners frequently do not suspect a compromise has taken
place. These source infections are the sites that appear in search-
engine results to queries for illicit products.
Source infections redirect to an optional intermediate set of traf-
ﬁc brokers (also called redirectors in related literature [15, 16]).
The trafﬁc broker ultimately redirects trafﬁc to a destination, typ-
ically an illicit business, e.g., an unlicensed pharmacy when en-
tering pharmaceutical search terms, or a distributor of counterfeit
software when entering software-related terms.
Among source infections, we can distinguish between results
that actively redirect at the time t of the measurement; inactive redi-
rects, i.e., sites that used to be redirecting at some point prior to t
but are not redirecting anymore—possibly because they have been
cleaned up, but have not yet disappeared from the Google search
results; and future redirects that appear in Google search results at
time t without redirecting yet, but that will eventually redirect at
a time t(cid:48) > t. Presumably those are sites that have been compro-
mised and already participate in link-farming [7], but have not yet
been conﬁgured to redirect.
As described above, the technology behind search redirections
has evolved over time. For the purpose of our study, active redi-
rects include fully automated redirections by HTTP 302, as well as
“embedded storefronts,” which result on HTTP 302 redirects when
a link is clicked on. Other types of redirections, such as JavaScript-
based redirects, or HTML “Refresh” meta-tags, could also be con-
sidered as active redirects, but we treat these separately.
4. DATA COLLECTION
Besides the time-consuming nature of such an endeavor, collect-
ing nearly four years’ worth of data is in itself a complex process.
Software and APIs used to acquire the data change over time, at-
tackers’ techniques evolve, and new defensive countermeasures are
frequently deployed.
In other words, the target of the measure-
ments itself changes over time. Thus, we must rely on several dis-
tinct sources of data we collected over the measurement period for
our analysis. Because of the heterogeneous nature of these datasets,
not all the data available can be used for all the analyses we want
to conduct. We ﬁrst characterize the queries used to produce these
different datasets, then the contents of the datasets, and ﬁnally our
methodology to combine the datasets.
4.1 Query corpus
The corpus of queries we use has a considerable inﬂuence on the
results we obtain. Owing to the prevalence of the trade of pharma-
ceutical products among search-engine poisoning activities, we use
a primary set of queries Q related to drugs. We complement this
ﬁrst set with queries related to other types of goods and services
routinely sold through abusive means: luxury counterfeit watches,
software, gambling, and books. We refer to this second query set
as Q(cid:48).
Drug-related queries. For our set of drug-related queries, we elect
to use the set of 218 queries we deﬁned in our previous work [15].
There are two reasons for that choice. First, using an identical
query set allows us to produce directly comparable results, and ex-
pand our relatively short-term initial analysis. Second, by compar-
ing results with those obtained from a query set based on an ex-
haustive list of U.S. prescription drugs, we have shown previously
that this relatively small set of queries provides adequate coverage
of the entire online prescription drug trade.
The entire set of queries Q can itself be partitioned according
to the presumed intention of the person issuing the query. For in-
stance, in the pharmaceutical realm, queries such as “prozac side
effects” appear to be seeking legitimate information—we term such
queries as benign queries. The set of all benign queries is denoted
by B (resp. B(t) at time t). On the other hand, certain queries may
denote questionable intentions. For example, somebody search-
ing for “vicodin without a prescription” would certainly expect a
number of search results to link to contraband sites. We call such
queries representing potentially illicit intent as such, and denote
them as being in a set I (resp. I(t) at time t). Finally, a number
of queries, e.g., “buy ativan online,” may not easily be classiﬁed as
exhibiting illicit or benign intent. We refer to these queries as being
in the gray set, G (resp. G(t) at time t).
Table 1 breaks down the query corpus Q between the illicit, be-
nign, and gray sets I, B, and G. Overall, the queries clearly as-
sociated with illicit intentions are the minority of the total queries
(22%), while the majority is placed in the gray category. This bias
of the query corpus towards informative types of queries (i.e. gray
and benign – 88% of total), rather than queries exhibiting illicit in-
tent, suggests that the extent and effects of the search-redirection
