2.5 Dynamic Pricing Model
In a decentralized version of the model proposed in the
previous section, each agent would need to maximize indi-
vidually their utility [16]:

that satisﬁes Assumptions 1 and 2, the outcome is ineﬃcient
and requires an external intervention, such as economic in-
centives [3, 4].
We now show a numerical example of how the Nash equi-
librium is diﬀerent than the Pareto equilibrium. We select
some typical numerical values and functions previously used
in the literature [23, 20]:

The selﬁsh actions of each individual might lead to the out-
come ξ, the Nash equilibrium of the game. Under Assump-
tions 1 and 2, we can show that the ﬁrst order conditions for
this selﬁsh optimization problem guarantee a unique max-
imum, i.e., a unique Nash equilibrium.
In addition, it is
easy to show that these ﬁrst order conditions (Nash equilib-
rium) do not match those from Eq. (2) (Pareto equilibrium).
Hence, the Nash equilibrium ξ of the game is not eﬃcient in
the sense of Pareto. In general, in a strategic environment
These functions satisfy Assumptions 1 and 2. In this case,
we consider T = 24 time periods and deﬁne the valuations of
each individual using consumption measurements provided
by the Colombian electricity system administrator [?] (a de-
tailed implementation of the simulations can be found in [4]).
We can see how the Nash equilibrium produces less total
utility for all parties (Fig. 1a) and produces more power
consumption (Fig. 1b) than the Pareto equilibrium.
While the Nash equilibrium ξ is suboptimal, we can show,

it reaches a steady state. From the perspective of popula-
tion games [27], we have a multi-population game, with the
following characteristics:
• There are N populations. Each population is associ-
ated with an agent.
• The resource to be allocated in each population is the
daily power consumption ||qi||1.
• The strategy of each user is the consumption at T time
intervals plus the consumption qT +1
that represents a
slack variable, i.e., the power not consumed in any
time interval is represented as a consumption in the
(T + 1)th time interval. Hence, in each population
there are T + 1 possible strategies.

• The ﬁtness functions are deﬁned as the derivative of
the utility function Ui(q), e.g., the ﬁtness (under nor-
mal operation) is the marginal utility, that is deﬁned
as:

We use replicator dynamics to solve the resource alloca-
tion problem in Eq. (3). These dynamics might be seen as
a set of deterministic rules that guide the resource alloca-
tion process to ﬁnd an outcome that maximizes the utility
of each agent.
In particular, the allocation is carried out
by evaluating the convenience of consuming some resources
at a given hour. An equilibrium is achieved when an agent
cannot increase its proﬁt by redistributing its resources (i.e.,
a Nash equilibrium).
Replicator dynamics are described by the diﬀerential equa-

While any actor (including attackers) can change their
actions arbitrarily, we consider that changes in power con-
sumption are bounded; hence, we model smooth demand
changes. A continuity notion that satisﬁes this requirement
is Lipschitz continuity, which is also a requirement for the
existence of a solution to a diﬀerential equation.
3. ADVERSARY MODEL
We assume an adversary model that compromises the cen-
tral system where the control signals are computed. For 1)
DLC, this means the attacker can arbitrarily send commands
to curtail loads to consumers, and for 2) dynamic pricing,
this means that the attacker can send arbitrary incentive
price signals to consumers.
In addition, we assume two types of attackers: 1) a fraud-
ster, whose objective is to defraud the system and pay less
for electricity (a version of electricity theft, only that in-
stead of falsifying their electricity consumption, it falsiﬁes
information sent to consumers), and 2) a malicious attacker,
whose objective is to damage the electricity distribution sys-
tem.
A fraudster does not necessarily want to attack the elec-
tric grid and the consumers of electricity (if the grid is down
the fraudster would get no utility), but wants to exploit
the system into behaving in unanticipated ways for personal
gain, such as paying less electricity than others. We as-
sume the attacker will still be charged at the correct price
Figure 2: Dynamic pricing DR model.
however, that if we consider an added incentive to the indi-
vidual cost function of each player, the Nash equilibrium of
the game with incentives can be made eﬃcient in the sense
of Pareto.
In order to incentivize agents to modify their
behavior for the good of the population, the social planner
sends them an incentive (e.g., a dynamic price signal or re-
ward) to indirectly control their load; therefore the new cost
function for the ith agent is

where incentives are of the form:
The form of this incentive is related to the price used in
the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism [22] and some utility
functions used in potential games [2]. Note that with these
incentives it can be shown that the ﬁrst-order conditions of
Eq. (6) are the same to the ﬁrst-order conditions of Eq. (2);
and therefore, the Nash equilibrium of the system with in-
centives is equal to the optimal outcome of the DLC model.
This dynamic pricing model is depicted in Fig. 2, where
the incentive I can represent the dynamic pricing signal.
In this DR approach we consider that the utility sends a
two dimensional signal to each customer, namely the total
consumption and the incentive (q, Ii)—in a practical imple-
mentation the utility would send the consumer the price of
electricity at the current time interval: p(q) instead of the
consumption q but this does not aﬀect our analysis—and
each customer responds with some consumption qi. Note
that the incentives modify the price paid by each user ac-
cording to their relative consumption. Hence, two diﬀerent
users receive diﬀerent incentives as long as their consump-
tion is diﬀerent. Speciﬁcally, users who introduce less exter-
nalities in the system receive larger incentives or rewards.
2.6 Transient (Evolutionary) Analysis
In the previous two sections we introduced solutions used
in game theory to ﬁnd equilibrium points (Pareto, Nash).
These solutions provide information about the system in
steady state, but overlook the trajectory followed to reach
such solutions. Furthermore, while ﬁnding the steady state
equilibrium is good for modeling the ﬁnal outcome of an at-
tack, we also need to consider the transient dynamics that
show how consumers will behave to changes in the market
and to maliciously injected signals. Thus, we can model
malicious attackers that will try to create sudden electric-
ity overloads in the system and damage power distribution
equipment or produce cascading failures.
Population dynamics [4] can be used to model negotia-
tion approaches between players of a game and are used to
for the electricity she consumes (that is the attacker has not
compromised the metering system). Defrauding the util-
ity company by compromising the control signals from DR
algorithms might be even more beneﬁcial for the attacker
than compromising the meter readings, because if an at-
tacker compromises the meter installed in its neighborhood
and is detected, then the utility has evidence to attribute
the attack; however, if the attack to the control signals is
detected, the fraudster can still claim deniability of this at-
tack as it is not immediately obvious who the culprit of the
attack is (in particular, the attacker can mask itself in a
large group of beneﬁciaries with a parameter γ that we will
introduce later).
We deﬁne a malicious attacker as an adversary whose goal
is to cause damage to the system and all their players. One
practical way to achieve this is to cause the maximum sud-
den overload in the power distribution network, which can
potentially cause blackouts because of equipment failures
(e.g. burnt transformers) and circuit breakers opening.
We note that in contrast to previous work, our attack
can be arbitrary, and thus can model realistic attackers not
tied to pre-speciﬁed attacks (such as delays). In addition,
we model two diﬀerent strategic attackers that will try to
achieve an objective, and will select the attack signal to
achieve this objective. For example, in the dynamic pricing
model the attacker will use mechanism design to generate
the incentives that will achieve its own goals.
4. FRAUDSTER (SELFISH) ATTACKER
4.1 Direct Load Control
The goal of the fraudster is to achieve the best possible
selﬁsh utility by manipulating all direct-load control signals
q. We consider a scenario with full information. The best
possible outcome for a fraudster with control of all con-
trol signals can be represented by the following optimization
problem:

If Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisﬁed, then there is a unique
solution to Eq. (10), denoted by q∗, that satisﬁes the fol-
lowing ﬁrst order conditions:
∇Ui(q)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q=q∗ = 0.
Speciﬁcally, the gradient of the utility for an attacker (the
ith agent) is

To implement these results, we consider a random state
q, from which the population evolves with the dynamics of
a uncompromised system (see Eq. (2)). At simulation time
2, an attacker compromises the system, causing a switch in
the system dynamics. The ﬁtness functions implemented in
the replicator dynamics are then changed from Eq. (2) to
those deﬁned by Eq. (11) and (12). Fig. 3a shows the evolu-
tion of both utility and consumption of the population. Fig.
3b show the ﬁnal state of the attacker in a compromised
and uncompromised system. From these ﬁgures we can see
that the attack is successful in obtaining more electricity
consumption while maximizing its utility; however, we can
see that the average utility function of the population de-
