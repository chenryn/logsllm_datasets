### Title: BlackHat US-19: HTTP Desync Attacks - Smashing into the Cell Next Door

**Abstract:**

HTTP requests are traditionally viewed as isolated, standalone entities. However, in this session, I will introduce techniques that remote, unauthenticated attackers can use to break through this isolation and splice their requests into others. Using these methods, I was able to manipulate the web infrastructure of numerous commercial and military systems, launch exploits on their visitors, and earn over $50,000 in bug bounties.

**Session Overview:**

Using real-world targets as case studies, I will demonstrate how to delicately modify victims' requests to redirect them to malicious destinations, trigger harmful responses, and lure credentials into the attacker's control. Additionally, I will show how to exploit backend reassembly of your own requests to leverage the trust placed on the frontend. This will enable you to gain maximum privilege access to internal APIs, poison web caches, and compromise even the most trusted login pages.

This attack is one for which the web is thoroughly unprepared. Although documented over a decade ago, its reputation for difficulty and potential collateral damage has led to it being largely ignored, allowing the web's vulnerability to grow. By applying fresh ideas and new techniques, I will reveal a vast landscape of vulnerable systems, ranging from large content delivery networks to custom backends.

To help you address this legacy issue, I will share a refined methodology and open-source tools for black-box detection, assessment, and exploitation with minimal risk of collateral damage. These tools and techniques will be developed from core concepts, ensuring that you leave the session equipped to devise your own desync techniques and tailor (or thwart) attacks against your target of choice.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Understanding the mechanics of HTTP desync attacks
- Techniques for splicing and manipulating HTTP requests
- Case studies of successful attacks on commercial and military systems
- Refined methodology and open-source tools for detecting and exploiting desync vulnerabilities
- Strategies for minimizing collateral damage and protecting against such attacks

By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of HTTP desync attacks and the skills to both defend against and conduct these sophisticated attacks.
