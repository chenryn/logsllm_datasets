# Feature request
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Amazon API Gateways have a stage in their URLs:
E.g. https://vbe6aad5c.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/home
This breaks next8 serverless page deployments routing because there doesn't
seem to be a way to configure nextjs with a basePath (/prod in this case).
## Describe the solution you'd like
I would like to be able to configure nextjs with a uri `basePath` which works
with next's routing.
Could be something like:
_next.config.js_
    module.exports = {
      uriBasePath: '/prod'
    }
Note `assetPrefix` doesn't work here because it applies only to static files
AFAIK.
## Describe alternatives you've considered
Using a custom domain for the AWS API GW would solve the problem as it removes
the /{stage} from the URL.
