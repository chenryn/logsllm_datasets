User: How to use Ansible automated deployment tool to manage multiple servers and control the communication between them?
Assistant: Using the Ansible automated deployment tool can easily manage multiple servers and control the communication between them. Here are the steps to use Ansible: 1. Define a host inventory: In Ansible, a host inventory is a file that contains a list of hosts to manage. Either INI file format or YAML format can be used. In a host inventory, hosts can be grouped into groups and host-specific variables can be defined. 2. Write Playbook: In Ansible, Playbook refers to the file that defines the task. Playbooks are written using the YAML file format and contain a set of tasks. With Playbook, tasks can be run on multiple hosts simultaneously. 3. Configure the host: Ansible uses the SSH protocol to communicate with the managed host. Therefore, before using Ansible, you need to verify the SSH access of the Ansible user so that you can easily use SSH to connect to the managed hosts. 4. Run the task: Once the Playbook is ready, the ansible-playbook command can be used to run the task. The ansible-playbook command can specify a playbook to run and a list of hosts on which to run the task. Using Ansible makes it easy to manage multiple hosts and ensure communication between them. Ansible makes managing servers simple and easy without manually configuring each server.
