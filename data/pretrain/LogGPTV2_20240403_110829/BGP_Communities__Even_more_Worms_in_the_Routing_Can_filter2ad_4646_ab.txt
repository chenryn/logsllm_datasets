to AS1 by tagging the announcement p with the path prepending
community of the provider of its provider, i.e., to steer traffic via
AS5 rather than AS3.
Performance impairment: If the performance via AS5 is signif-
icantly worse than the performance via AS3, AS2 may slow down
an application originating in AS6 that is clogging its network.
Because BGP communities are transitive attributes, the above is
fully compliant with the specification. But the actual behavior/use
depends on the policies of the involved ASes, in particular, AS3 and
AS4.
The above is a teaser example to highlight some potentially unin-
tended consequences of transitive BGP community use. In Section 5
we show multiple scenarios for traffic steering as well as remotely
triggered blackholing (dropping of traffic). When combined with
prefix hijacking [39] this raises significant security concerns. Thus,
we argue that transitive BGP communities are ła can of wormsž for
the routing system.
3.2 BGP Communities Shortcomings
We believe that BGP communities may be an insufficiently con-
strained feature for the Internet routing system for the following
reasons.
Missing Semantics: Communities are łjust tags.ž This has mul-
tiple consequences: (a) Communities do not have a generally
agreed upon semantic. Only a few communities and the łex-
pectedž community format are standardized via RFCs (Section 2).

Table 1: Overview of BGP dataset (April 2018). IPv4 prefixes contributed 92% to the total number of prefixes while IPv6 con-
tributes 8%. Therefore, we focus on IPv4 for all other statistics.
This is analogous to having a program’s semantics in the com-
ment statements. (b) Communities are AS specific. Each AS can
define their own communities and determine how to publish
them, e.g., publicly or only to their peers/customers. (c) The
order in which communities are processed by a router is not
well-specified and differs by operator configuration as well as
by equipment vendor.
No authentication of tagger/community: Any AS on the path
can add or modify any of the communities of a routing update.
The recipient of a community cannot determine which AS on
the path added or modified any of the communities.
Yet, communities are critical for operation since complex rout-
ing policies are a reality and unlikely to change. Currently, BGP
communities are the most convenient way for signaling informa-
tion between ASes ś an essential component for realizing routing
policies. Moreover, an AS may not only mistakenly or maliciously
tag a route with a community, it may even free-ride, i.e., hijack a
prefix or subprefix3 by announcing them tagged with a community
of their choice.
Given the above, one has to ask what this implies for the Internet
routing system. First, each AS should define its policy in regard
to remote community use and/or install appropriate filters and
community parsers. Second, policy implementation should account
for ill-specified and misused communities. Misuse of communities
can either happen due to malicious intent or by mistake, e.g., due
to fat or thin fingers. Indeed, when considering the above short-
comings, together with the scenarios highlighted in Section 5, we
urge the community to rethink whether communities are the right
mechanism and, if so, how to ameliorate the above shortcomings.
3.3 Terminology
In the rest of the paper we use the following terminology:
Attackee: The attackee in our context is the AS whose prefix/traffic
is affected by manipulating the community attribute of an up-
date.
Attacker: The attacker is the AS which is manipulating the com-
munity attribute of an update or announcing a hijacked (sub-)
prefix.
Community target: The AS whose community service is used
to change the route or traffic flow. We sometimes also refer to
this AS as the community provider.
3Hijacking a route corresponds to announcing a prefix for which the AS is not respon-
sible for.

Thus, in Figure 2 AS3 is the community target, AS2 is the attacker
and depending on AS2’s motivation the attackee is AS4 or AS1.
4 BGP COMMUNITIES PROPAGATION
According to RFC1997 [25] BGP communities are an optional tran-
sitive attribute. Yet, their expected use is often between two AS
neighbors. In this section, we tackle this apparent contradiction.
First, we measure how common BGP communities use is. Then, we
show how often communities are propagated beyond a single hop,
i.e., are transitive, or if they even on the AS path. Finally, we check
for indications that ASes actively strip communities.
4.1 Datasets
We rely on a multitude of vantage points within the Internet routing
system.
BGP routing tables and updates: We rely on the widely-used
public datasets of the route collectors from (i) RIPE NCC Routing
Information Service (RIS) [17], (ii) University of Oregon Route
Views (RV) [18], (iii) Isolario project (IS) [9], and (iv) Packet
Clearing House (PCH) [13]. Each of these platforms consists of
multiple routers which collect BGP updates from many BGP
peers. Some BGP peers send full routing tables, others partial
views, and even others only their customer routes. We use the
data for the month of April 2018. We remove AS path prepending
to not bias the AS path. For an overview see Table 1. One specialty
