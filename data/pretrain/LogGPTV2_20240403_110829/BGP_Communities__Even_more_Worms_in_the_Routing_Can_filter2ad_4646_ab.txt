### Traffic Steering and BGP Communities

To steer traffic via AS5 instead of AS3, AS1 can prepend the path announcement with a community tag provided by its upstream provider. If the performance through AS5 is significantly worse than through AS3, AS2 might slow down applications originating in AS6, which could congest its network.

**Performance Impairment:**
- **Scenario:** If the performance via AS5 is much worse than via AS3, AS2 may slow down an application originating in AS6, leading to network congestion.
- **BGP Community Transitivity:** Since BGP communities are transitive attributes, this behavior is compliant with the specification. However, the actual behavior depends on the policies of the involved ASes, particularly AS3 and AS4.

This example highlights some potentially unintended consequences of using transitive BGP communities. In Section 5, we explore multiple scenarios for traffic steering and remotely triggered blackholing (dropping of traffic). When combined with prefix hijacking, this raises significant security concerns. Therefore, we argue that transitive BGP communities can be a "can of worms" for the routing system.

### Shortcomings of BGP Communities

We believe that BGP communities may be insufficiently constrained for the Internet routing system due to the following reasons:

1. **Missing Semantics:**
   - **Tags Without Agreed Semantics:** Communities are just tags without a generally agreed-upon semantic. Only a few communities and their expected format are standardized via RFCs (Section 2).
   - **AS-Specific Definitions:** Each AS can define its own communities and decide how to publish them, either publicly or only to peers/customers.
   - **Processing Order Ambiguity:** The order in which communities are processed by a router is not well-specified and can vary based on operator configuration and equipment vendor.

2. **No Authentication of Tagger/Community:**
   - **Lack of Traceability:** Any AS on the path can add or modify any of the communities of a routing update. The recipient cannot determine which AS added or modified the communities.

Despite these shortcomings, BGP communities are critical for complex routing policies. They are currently the most convenient way to signal information between ASes. An AS may mistakenly or maliciously tag a route with a community or even hijack a prefix or subprefix by announcing it with a community of their choice.

Given these issues, each AS should define its policy regarding remote community use and install appropriate filters and community parsers. Policy implementation should account for ill-specified and misused communities, which can occur due to malicious intent or human error. We urge the community to reconsider whether BGP communities are the right mechanism and, if so, how to address these shortcomings.

### Terminology

In the rest of the paper, we use the following terminology:

- **Attackee:** The AS whose prefix or traffic is affected by manipulating the community attribute of an update.
- **Attacker:** The AS that manipulates the community attribute of an update or announces a hijacked (sub-)prefix.
- **Community Target:** The AS whose community service is used to change the route or traffic flow. This AS is also referred to as the community provider.

### BGP Communities Propagation

According to RFC1997, BGP communities are an optional transitive attribute. However, their expected use is often between two AS neighbors. In this section, we address this apparent contradiction by measuring the commonality of BGP community use, their propagation beyond a single hop, and indications that ASes actively strip communities.

#### Datasets

We rely on multiple vantage points within the Internet routing system:

- **BGP Routing Tables and Updates:** We use public datasets from:
  - RIPE NCC Routing Information Service (RIS)
  - University of Oregon Route Views (RV)
  - Isolario project (IS)
  - Packet Clearing House (PCH)

Each platform consists of multiple routers that collect BGP updates from many BGP peers. Some peers send full routing tables, others partial views, and some only customer routes. We use data from April 2018, removing AS path prepending to avoid bias. For an overview, see Table 1.

- **PCH Platform Specialty:** PCH maintains route collectors that peer with route servers at about 180 different IXPs around the globe (as of April 2018). Route servers are typically a value-added service of the IXP that collects routing information.

### BGP Communities Use Over Time

Figure 3 shows the use of BGP communities over time, highlighting the number of unique ASes, unique communities, absolute communities, and BGP table entries.

### Summary

- **Traffic Steering Example:** AS1 can steer traffic via AS5 using BGP community tagging, but this can lead to performance issues.
- **Shortcomings of BGP Communities:** Lack of semantics, AS-specific definitions, and no authentication of tagger/community.
- **Terminology:** Definitions for attackee, attacker, and community target.
- **Propagation Analysis:** Measurement of BGP community use and propagation across ASes.

By addressing these issues, we aim to improve the security and reliability of the Internet routing system.
