Figure 17: Performance gain of Braidio over Bluetooth
for bi-directional data transmissions between two devices
Figure 18: Performance gain of Braidio over Bluetooth
for transmission over different distances.
Scenario 2: Bi-directional communication
In Scenario 1, we assumed that trafﬁc was one way between
the device on the x axis to the device on the y axis. But
what if the communication was bi-directional, for example,
when a device is both a sensor as well as a display device
(like Google Glass and HMDs). We now study the effect
of bi-directional data transfer i.e., when the transmitter and
receiver switch roles after send a certain amount of packets.
Equal amount of data is transmitted in both directions. We
compare against Bluetooth as baseline. Experimental results
are shown in Figure 17.
The results are a bit better than the unidirectional case.
This is because in highly asymmetric scenarios, the device
with less energy budget is able to use the backscatter mode
when communicating and the passive receiver mode when
receiving, which increases the beneﬁts. When devices are
somewhat symmetric, the beneﬁt is limited.
Scenario 3: Increasing distance
So far, we have assumed that the transmitter and receiver
are a short distance apart so that all modes have roughly e-
qual throughput. Let’s now explore whether the performance
beneﬁts of Braidio remain as distance increases. We choose
three pairs of devices to study how the beneﬁts evolve as
distance increases. The results are shown in Figure 18.
The performance of Braidio at short distances is extremely
strong since the asymmetric modes are viable and efﬁcient.
When the bitrate of the backscatter mode drops, so do the
beneﬁts we can get with Braidio although we can still get
more than 10× improvement compared to Bluetooth. Final-
ly, at 2.4m, we transition out of the zone where backscatter
communication can work. so we can only use the active and
passive receiver modes. So, the beneﬁts are only available in
cases where a device with a large energy budget is transmit-
ting to a device with a small energy budget, as shown in the
top right part of the matrix in Figure 15. We don’t show the
result with distance longer than 6m because only the active
mode works, so the performance of Braidio is identical to
Bluetooth.
7. RELATED WORK
The problem of low-power wireless communication has
seen decades of research. Of particular note is methods that
use two radios; for example, [23, 35, 42] employ multiple
wireless interfaces such as WiFi and Bluetooth to achieve
better energy efﬁciency by switching between them accord-
ing to link conditions, [21] and [38] use a low power radio to
wake up high power ones, [43] and [49] exploit duty-cycling
to shut down a wireless radio between transmissions, [37]
and [52] compress data before transmission for reducing the
power consumed by wireless radios, [31] and [45] tune the
transmitted RF power when SNR is sufﬁcient for data com-
munication, and so on. Braidio is radically different in that
it enables true asymmetric operation by providing carrier of-
ﬂoad capability.
Our work is also inspired by a number of recent advances
in Backscatter communication such as the use of ambien-
t RF signals for backscatter
[36], low-power high-speed
backscatter by optimizing the underlying communication pro-
tocol
[29, 30, 50, 54], the use of existing wireless radios
and infrastructure for backscatter [28, 34], improved coding
technique and hardware design [41], design of low power R-
FID readers [39] as well as high order modulation schemes
such as 16QAM [48]. We also build on the experiences
and ideas that have come out of the extensive recent research
new hardware platforms for backscatter and self-interference
cancellation including full duplex wireless [24, 25, 32], and
backscatter tag designs such as Moo [53] and WISP [46, 47].
8. CONCLUSION
To conclude, we present Braidio, a radically new design
for a radio that can operate across active and passive modes,
and addresses the increasing asymmetry in energy availabil-
395
ity as devices become smaller. This is a ﬁrst-of-its-kind de-
vice, and one that we believe can be a powerful new addition
to the suite of power management techniques that we use on
mobile devices. The core innovation is our ability to perform
carrier ofﬂoad, thereby shifting the cost of communication to
either end point. By multiplexing between different ofﬂoad-
ing modes, Braidio can support transmitter to receiver power
ratios between 1:2546 to 3546:1, spanning seven orders of
magnitude. We show that Braidio increases the number of
bits exchanged between a transmitter and receiver by more
than two orders of magnitude over Bluetooth, particularly in
highly asymmetric scenarios.
