## Abstract
This paper introduces a method for detecting cryptojacking activities by analyzing content-agnostic network traffic flows. The proposed method first identifies crypto-mining activities by profiling the traffic using fast Fourier transform (FFT) at each time window. It then generates variation vectors between adjacent time windows and employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to recognize cryptojacking patterns. Compared to existing approaches, this method is privacy-preserving and can detect both browser-based and malware-based cryptojacking. Additionally, it is easy to deploy, as it can monitor all devices within a network by accessing packet headers from the gateway router.

## 1. Introduction
Cryptocurrencies have gained significant popularity due to their value appreciation and innovative concepts. One such concept is cryptocurrency mining (crypto-mining), which not only verifies transactions and generates new cryptocurrencies but also establishes consensus, a critical component of blockchain systems. With computing resources, electricity, and an internet connection, individuals can turn their devices into cryptocurrency miners.

However, the lucrative potential of crypto-mining has attracted hackers who compromise personal computers, servers, and even Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero. This unauthorized use of computing resources is known as cryptojacking. Hackers often employ tactics such as phishing emails, malicious JavaScript code, or server compromises to conduct cryptojacking. Despite the shutdown of Coinhive, a popular in-browser mining service, in March 2019, cryptojacking remains a significant threat. Reports indicate that unsuspecting victims were cryptojacked 52.7 million times in the first half of 2019, and 50,000 servers were infected with sophisticated crypto-mining malware, causing substantial economic losses.

To address this issue, researchers have developed various cryptojacking detection methods. For example, CMTracker by Hong et al. monitors browser behaviors and detects cryptojacking scripts using hash-based and stack-based profiling. Tahir et al. proposed a machine learning solution based on hardware-assisted profiling of browser code. Darabian et al. used deep learning techniques to detect crypto-mining malware through static and dynamic analysis. However, these approaches require access to private data and cannot handle malware obfuscation.

In this paper, we propose a method to detect cryptojacking by analyzing only the network traffic flows. This approach is content-agnostic, protecting user privacy while detecting potential malicious activities. Our method is easy to deploy, as it can be installed at the network's gateway to monitor all devices.

## 2. Methodology
Our cryptojacking detection approach can be deployed by network administrators or users at any router or switch between the devices and the mining pools. Figure 1 illustrates the operational model. The system requires certain fields from IP packet headers, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, packet size, and timestamp. These data are content-agnostic and contain no private information. We use sFlow to capture these data, though other packet capturing engines like NetFlow and Bro are also compatible.

### 2.1 Phase One: Detection of Crypto-Mining Traffic
In the first phase, we identify crypto-mining traffic by analyzing the communication between miners and mining pools. A mining pool aggregates resources from multiple miners to overcome the increasing difficulty of solo mining. The Stratum protocol, widely used for mining, ensures that miners can join the pool easily. Our method captures sFlow data and uses FFT to profile the traffic. We then match the incoming traffic against predefined crypto-mining profiles in the frequency domain to identify potential crypto-mining traffic.

### 2.2 Phase Two: Detection of Cryptojacking Activities
In the second phase, we infer hash-rate variations by analyzing the results from the first phase. We use an RNN to detect cryptojacking activities based on the identified crypto-mining traffic. This two-phase approach allows us to accurately identify and differentiate between legitimate and malicious crypto-mining activities.

## Conclusion
Our method provides a privacy-preserving and effective way to detect cryptojacking in network traffic. By analyzing content-agnostic data, it can be easily deployed at the network's gateway, offering a robust solution to protect against unauthorized crypto-mining activities.
