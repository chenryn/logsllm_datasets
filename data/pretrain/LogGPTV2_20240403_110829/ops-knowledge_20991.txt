User: How to achieve remote server access by using SSH?
Assistant: SSH (Secure Shell) is an encrypted network communication protocol through which remote server access can be realized. The following are the steps to achieve remote server access: 1. Install the SSH client: Install the SSH client on the local computer, the more commonly used ones are PuTTY (Windows system) and Terminal (Mac system). 2. Obtain the server IP address: You need to obtain the IP address of the remote server to be accessed, which can be queried in the server console. 3. Connect to the remote server: Use the SSH client to connect to the remote server. When connecting, you need to enter the IP address and port number of the server. The default SSH port number is 22. If the connection is successful, you will be prompted to enter the user name and password to log in to the server. 4. Remote operation server: After successful login, you can use the SSH client on the local computer to operate the remote server, and you can execute commands, upload files, download files and other operations. It should be noted that, in order to ensure security, the remote server generally restricts the remote login of the root account, so it is necessary to create a common account and set the corresponding permissions. In addition, the SSH protocol uses public key/private key encryption, and you can choose to use the private key for encryption when connecting, which is more secure and reliable.
