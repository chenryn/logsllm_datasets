  that	
  the

  the

  the

  The

  When

  an

  remember	
that	
  40	
  AWG	
  wire	
  is	
  incredibly	
  thin	
  and	
  easy	
  to	
  break	
  so	
  it	
  helps	
  to	
  use	
  adhesives	
  to	
  hold	
  in	
  the	
  wires	
  of	
the

  while	
  also	
  better	
  securing	
  the	
  antenna	
  as	
  a	
  whole	
  to	
  the

  Otherwise	
  it	
  can	
  be	
  very	
frustrating	
  to	
  finish

  an	
  antenna	
  only	
  to	
  tear

  much
