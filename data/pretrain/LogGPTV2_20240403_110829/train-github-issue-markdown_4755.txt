# Bug report
## Describe the bug
The final generated HTML contains multiple references of the same script when
using `dynamic(() => import("XXX"))` feature.
Firefox downloads twice `commons.2e47dd92dd81134f73ae.js`, I guess the `async`
flag presents in the first reference, and not present in the second reference
make a difference. Chrome does not behave the same.
## To Reproduce
You can download the example here
https://github.com/ekino/rendr/blob/master/examples/nextjs-with-remoteapi/.
The dynamic declarations are there:

remoteapi/pages/_rendr.js#L12-L18
There is also a live demo here: https://nextjs-with-remoteapi.rande.now.sh/
## Expected behavior
No duplicate references.
