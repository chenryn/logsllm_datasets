## Abstract
This paper introduces 5GReasoner, a framework for property-guided formal verification of control-plane protocols across multiple layers of the 5G protocol stack. The analysis conducted by 5GReasoner can be viewed as an instance of model checking in an adversarial environment. By effectively using behavior-specific abstraction in our manually extracted 5G protocol, 5GReasoner's analysis generalizes prior analyses of cellular protocols by reasoning about properties not only regarding packet payload but also multi-layer protocol interactions. We instantiated 5GReasoner with two model checkers and a cryptographic protocol verifier, combining them through the use of the abstraction-refinement principle. Our analysis of the extracted 5G protocol model, covering six key control-layer protocols spanning two layers of the 5G protocol stack, identified 11 design weaknesses leading to attacks with both security and privacy implications. Additionally, we discovered five previous design weaknesses that 5G inherits from 4G, which can be exploited to violate its security and privacy guarantees.

## Introduction
The imminent deployment of the fifth generation (5G) cellular network has generated significant enthusiasm in both industry and academia, particularly due to its potential to enable new applications such as smart vehicles and remote robotic surgery. 5G is envisioned not only as a replacement for home broadband Internet but also as a technology that will impact military and emergency management by improving situational awareness. These novel and critical applications are attributed to the following enhancements over 4G LTE:
1. Improvements in physical-layer technologies, enabling support for a large number of devices with significantly improved bandwidth.
2. Robust security posture due to the introduction of security measures in the upper layers of the 5G protocol stack.

However, the 5G standard has also introduced new security challenges, including:
- New security policies that have not been formally verified against adversarial assumptions.
- Retention of security mechanisms from 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) and its predecessors.

This paper aims to develop highly automated approaches for property-guided formal verification of control-plane protocols in the 5G protocol stack.

### Scope and Problem
The 5G control-plane consists of several critical procedures (e.g., initial registration, deregistration, paging) that are essential for fundamental cellular services such as voice calls, SMS, data, and billing. Vulnerabilities in these procedures can lead to serious consequences, such as man-in-the-middle attacks and spurious mobile billing. This paper addresses the following research question: Can we formally verify six 5G NAS layer procedures—initial registration, deregistration, paging, configuration update, handover, and service request—and the corresponding five RRC layer procedures, spanning two control-plane layers, against relevant security and privacy properties?

### Challenges
To achieve our goal, we need to address the following challenges:
1. **Specification**: The 5G protocol lacks a formal specification, making it prone to ambiguity and under-specification.
2. **Protocol Complexity**: 5G comprises multiple inter-dependent and stateful sub-protocols across multiple layers, with various types of protocol participants and messages containing data with a large domain.
3. **Obtaining Requirements**: The standard often states security and privacy requirements in an abstract way, requiring careful considerations and complex assumptions to formulate formal properties. The conformance test suites prescribed by the 3GPP standard encompass only primitive security requirements, lacking completeness and consideration of adversarial environments. Current 5G test suites do not include conformance requirements for core network components.

### Existing Efforts on 5G Formal Verification
Only two previous efforts have formally analyzed the 5G protocol, focusing solely on the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol of the initial registration procedure. These analyses were performed in isolation without considering their interaction with other procedures.

### Approach
Our approach builds on the work by Hussain et al. [28], who proposed LTEInspector, a framework for adversarially testing 4G LTE control-plane protocols. LTEInspector combines a symbolic model checker and a cryptographic protocol verifier using an abstraction-refinement principle. However, LTEInspector has limitations:
- It considers only a single layer of the protocol stack in isolation.
- It models only packet types, missing out on data- and payload-dependent protocol behavior.
- Its adversary instantiation cannot handle protocols spanning different layers.

5GReasoner addresses these limitations by modeling each protocol layer (NAS and RRC) as a single state machine. The NAS and RRC layer state machines communicate through a private channel, while RRC layer state machines on different entities (cellular device and base station) communicate through a public, adversary-controlled channel. The adversary is modeled as a Dolev-Yao adversary, non-deterministically dropping, modifying, or injecting messages/payloads while respecting well-formedness conditions. Our 5G protocol model includes 27 states and 238 transitions.

To address scalability issues, we use behavior-specific predicate abstraction, capturing only those packet payloads that impact security- and privacy-specific behavior. We instantiate 5GReasoner with two infinite-state model checkers (Kind 2 and nuXmv) and a cryptographic protocol verifier (ProVerif). For evaluation, we gathered and verified 187 properties of the 5G protocol model. Each counterexample provided by the model checker was confirmed with ProVerif before being reported as a design weakness.

### Findings
Significant findings include:
- **Exposing the Device’s TMSI and Paging Occasion Attack**: Enables an adversary to track a victim device’s location, hijack the paging channel, and learn the TMSI, facilitating further attacks.
- **Installing Null Ciphering and Null Integrity Attack**: Can lead to a UE in limited service mode exposing its SUPI, violating a critical security requirement.

### Contributions
In summary, the paper makes the following technical contributions:
1. Proposes 5GReasoner, a framework for property-guided formal verification of 5G control-plane protocols.
2. Constructs a formal model of the 5G protocol covering six NAS layer procedures and five RRC layer procedures, providing sufficient information to reason about temporal properties related to packet payload, data, and timer behavior. This model is independently useful for testing 5G-enabled devices.
3. Evaluates the 5G protocol model against 187 properties, revealing 11 new exploitable protocol design weaknesses and discovering five prior attacks inherited from 4G LTE. These findings have severe security and privacy implications, including downgrade and SUPI catching.

## Background
### 5G System Architecture
The 5G architecture can be divided into three main components: User Equipment (UE), the 5G radio access network (5G-RAN), and the 5G core network (5G-CN).

#### UE
The "User Equipment" is a device (e.g., a smartphone) equipped with a USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module). Each USIM is uniquely identified by its SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier). Unlike 4G, 5G USIMs can generate random nonces.

#### 5G-RAN
In 5G, a geographical area is partitioned into hexagonal cells, each serviced by a gNB (5G base-station). 5G cells are powered by low-power base stations, providing fast coverage with low latency. The 5G-RAN connects UEs to gNBs and facilitates communication between gNBs.

#### 5G-CN
The 5G core network (5G-CN) is a mesh of interconnected services. Key components include:
- **Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)**: Manages registration, detach procedures, paging, and services related to registration, connection, and mobility.
- **Authentication Server Function (AUSF)**: Stores UE identities, keys, and subscription data.
- **Unified Data Management (UDM)**: Generates Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) credentials.

### NAS Layer Procedures
#### Initial Registration
After rebooting, a UE performs a radio setup procedure, gets assigned a C-RNTI, and establishes communication through the RRC layer. The UE then sends a `reg_request` message, including its SUCI (an encryption of its SUPI with a random nonce). The AMF completes the authentication procedure with the help of AUSF. After successful authentication, the AMF initiates the negotiation of ciphering and integrity algorithms. The NAS level security context is established, and the selected algorithms are applied to subsequent NAS messages. The registration procedure concludes with the AMF sending a `reg_accept` message containing the UE’s TMSI, and the UE responds with a `reg_complete` message.

#### Deregistration
To disconnect from the network, the UE sends a `ue_dereg_request` message, and the network responds with a `dereg_accept` message.

#### Configuration Update
The network can initiate this procedure to update the UE configuration, e.g., assign a new TMSI. The AMF sends a `config_update_command` message, and the UE acknowledges with a `config_update_complete` message.

#### Service Request
The UE invokes this procedure when it receives a paging request or has pending uplink data in idle mode. The UE sends a `service_request` message to the AMF, and the network responds with a `service_accept` message.

### RRC Layer Procedures
#### RRC Setup
The RRC setup procedure establishes an RRC connection and transfers initial NAS dedicated information from the UE to the network.

#### RRC Security Activation
This procedure activates security upon RRC connection establishment.

#### RRC Release
The network uses this procedure to release established radio bearers and all radio resources or to suspend the RRC connection, assigning an I-RNTI (Inactive-Radio Network Temporary Identifier) to the UE.

#### RRC Connection Reconfiguration
This procedure modifies an RRC connection, e.g., to establish, modify, or release radio bearers. The network sends a `rrc_reconfiguration` message, and the UE replies with `rrc_reconfiguration_complete` to acknowledge the reconfiguration.

#### RRC Connection Resume
5G NR introduces a new RRC state, RRC inactive, in addition to RRC connected and RRC idle states. When a UE is powered up, it is in the disconnected/idle state. It can move to RRC connected with an initial RRC setup or connection establishment. If there is no activity, it can suspend its session by moving to the RRC inactive state, reducing system access, saving power, and optimizing mobility.
