## 📝 Provide a description of the new feature
Think about origin Win10's zones:
  * We count pin a window to right half of screen by Win+→
  * Then pin to bottom-right but Win+↓
  * At last, restore it to right zone by Win+↑
I mean, when moving window across zones, could we change the step from single
shortcut to double shortcuts?  
Just like grid layout, with a window in bottom-right zone:
  * When pressed Win+↑, it spans across 2 zones to the left side of screen instead of moving to top-right
  * Then press Win+↑ again, it shirnks to top-right
## Why do we need this?
I'm using grid layout to arrange 4 docs/browsers for browsing infomations,
placing music player, etc.
Then when I came up to work with something, I need a workspace **large
enough**. That is, an interactive window(mso word, or IDE) spans across 2
zones, and leave 2 zones remain for retrieving infomations.
But I couldn't use Win+↑ or Win+← to span my window ascross zones. I can only
drag my window's boarder to resize it.
It is not elegant.
We need cross-zone-spanning.
