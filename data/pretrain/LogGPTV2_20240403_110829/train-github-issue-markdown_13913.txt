  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.  
But I think that this issue #3319 can be related and maybe solve the problem.
## Current Behavior
Based on what I have:  
I have a folder estructure working with `yarn workspaces` with multiple
workspaces like:
|-- packages  
|-- .babelrc  
..  
..  
..  
|----- shared  
|-------- components // named @org/components  
|-------- utils // named @org/utils  
|----- web  
|------- app // named @org/mainApp  
|--------- src  
|------------ next.config.js  
|------------ .babelrc  
|----------- pages  
....  
...  
|------- otherPackage // named @org/otherPackage
Where `app` folder is a next.js app that **import** code from the other
components.
The dev mode of next is run from root folder using `npm run web` that call
`next packages/web/app/src` to allow next to found the pages folder (and
`next.config.js` and `.babelrc` )
After run and start compiling, and get the "success" mensaje, some errors
arise in the console on web loaded.  
Errors referring to the use of `type` and `import` keywords in the files that
comes from the imported modules (modules named as `@org/` that lives inside
the same repo but (maybe) in other workspaces).
This means that next webpack configuration is not transpiling the imported
files. (the `babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types` is installed in
packages/web/app and also in the root folder)
## Expected Behavior
Should not have any error with the imported files and works as expected (no
problem with es6 and flow).
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create a project with yarn workspaces activated
  2. Create at least two workspaces
  3. Create a package inside a workspace that run with next
  4. Import file from other workspaces
