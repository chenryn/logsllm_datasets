Fig. 10: Hidden privacy settings on downloads
V. MEASUREMENT
With the real feedback from two human subject studies
lasting for several months and our scalable tool Hound, we
are able to look into the problem of privacy settings in
100,000 popular apps and gain unprecedented understandings
of them from users’ perspective. Our results not only show
the pervasiveness of hidden privacy settings but also disclose
the behind reasons why privacy settings are viewed as hidden.
Especially, through the evolution of privacy settings, we show
how privacy settings are changed to hidden even if developers
may actually have opposite willing. Further, we reveal that a
large number of settings are set to leak user privacy by default.
A. Landscape
As shown in Table VI, 7,058 out of 100,000 apps have
privacy settings. To our surprise, Hound ﬁnds that nearly half
of them (47.04% = 3,320/7,058) have some hidden privacy
settings. Moreover, these hidden ones cover more than one-third
(36.29% = 6,723/18,526) of all the privacy settings discovered.
On average, each app contains 2.03 (6,723/3,320) hidden
privacy settings. For the apps with a lot of downloads, the
problem of hidden privacy settings looks less severe, as shown
in Figure 10. Given that the popular apps actually contain
more privacy settings than those less popular, an educated
guess could be that the developers of the popular apps might
pay more attention to the usability of privacy settings and
therefore are more likely to make these settings explicit.
We compare the number of privacy settings between English
apps from Google Play and Chinese ones from the Baidu
market. From Table VI, we can see that English apps have
more privacy settings than Chinese apps. Speciﬁcally, 9.45%
English apps contain privacy settings while only 4.67% Chinese
apps do. This leads to our speculation that the developers of
English apps might attach more importance to privacy. Further,
among the 4,724 English apps containing privacy settings,
45.15% (2,133/4,724) include hidden ones. For Chinese apps,
the ratio turns out to be similar (50.86%=1,187/2,334). Also,
about one-third of all privacy settings in both English (38.49%)
and Chinese apps (30.99%) are hard to ﬁnd, which indicates
that hidden privacy setting can be a pervasive issue for both
English and Chinese apps.
B. Why Does a Privacy Setting Become Hidden?
After manually analyzing each one of the detected 1,132
hidden privacy settings from 500 randomly sampled apps,
we ﬁnd that there are two main fundamental causes of their
problematic designs for developers. One is that developers
make problematic categorization and place a privacy setting
into a view unfamiliar to users though they think the place is
easy for users to ﬁnd. The other one is that developers use
confusing descriptions on privacy settings or indicators in the
way they understand but not so for users. We describe them
as follows.
Problematic categorization. As mentioned previously, users
expect privacy settings are in the view titled Privacy Settings.
However, developers may place them in other views. From our
evaluation, we ﬁnd that 790 apps do not even have the view of
Privacy Settings for placing their 1,247 privacy settings. 857
apps disseminate their 1,327 privacy settings in other views
other than Privacy Settings which actually exists in the apps.
We ﬁnd three places where developers put hidden privacy
settings.
Firstly, developers place a privacy setting to the view
related to its functionality. For example, a famous travel
app called Baidu Map has a functionality called “Track”
to record all previous tracks that a user navigated before,
for letting the navigation better match users’ expectation.
To protect users’ privacy, several settings are designed to
control the tracks collection, such as “allow to record your
driving/walking navigation tracks”. The UI-path of this
privacy setting is M e → T rack → T rackSettings →
allow to record your driving/walking navigation tracks.
Developers expect users could ﬁnd the setting when using the
functionality. However, from our study, it is pretty difﬁcult for
a user to locate the setting.
Secondly, developers place a privacy setting to a view whose
title has similar semantics with the privacy setting. For example,
a privacy setting “Who can send me private messages” is placed
under a view titled Message Settings in two popular apps (i.e.,
a radio app named Lanrentingshu with more than 80 million
downloads and a social app named Wangliao with more than
2 million downloads). Also put into Message Settings are anti-
spam privacy settings. Even though the setting and view’s title
have the same keyword “message”, users in our experiments
never try to locate the privacy setting from this view.
Thirdly, developers put privacy settings in the view of general
settings. We ﬁnd 293 apps put their privacy settings in Account
or Notiﬁcation, and 116 apps put privacy settings into the
view titled Edit Proﬁle. Such design lets users get lost when
they have to ﬁnd the setting. Some lazy developers even mix
privacy settings with others and put all of them into the Settings
view, which results in too many settings in a view for users
to locate. Generally, once there are more than ten settings
in a view, users have to swipe the screen to check them all.
From our evaluation, we ﬁnd that 5.89% (396/6,723) hidden
privacy settings are mixed with non-privacy settings, and they
are located in the middle of a view with more than ten settings.

Fig. 11: Example of strange icons for settings
Taking the famous social app Instagram as an example, users
have to locate the privacy setting “Allow accounts you follow
and anyone you message to see when you were last active on
Instagram apps” after swiping the screen to the 26th setting
in the view which contains 38 settings and 36 of them are
non-privacy.
Confusing description. Developers should describe an indi-
cator or a setting in the way that users get used to. However,
in our evaluation, we ﬁnd 237 apps having hidden settings
contain 271 uncommonly used descriptions which mislead users
for locating a privacy setting. Typically, Proﬁle and Settings
are two indicators that almost always appear in a UI-path to
privacy settings. In our evaluation, we ﬁnd 58 apps use their
synonyms (e.g., use “Privacy Shortcuts” instead of “Privacy
Settings”). For users who get used to the most common terms,
even replacing “Privacy Settings” with “Privacy Controls” will
let them feel confusing. The situations are even diverse for
icon indicators. We ﬁnd 47 uncommonly used icons in our
evaluation. Figure 11 shows some examples for Settings. The
ﬁve icons, especially the last one (in a Chinese popular social
app with more than 100 million downloads), are far from the
meaning of “setting”.
Another problem is that an indicator fails to let users infer
the privacy settings it guides. For example, in a famous social
app for job hunting named Maimai, an indicator with text
“who can see me” guides to the privacy settings “whether allow
search engine ﬁnd me” and “whether create a Hudon wiki for
me automatically”. Most users in our evaluation cannot infer
the two privacy settings when they see the indicator. Such cases
happen to 74 privacy settings in 39 apps. Also, too long texts
to describe an indicator or a setting also let users lose patience.
From our evaluation, we ﬁnd that the texts to describe privacy
settings in English apps usually range from 1 to 173 words,
which is much more than that in Chinese apps (usually with 2
to 15 words). Among them, 70 English hidden settings have
more than 30 words, and 24 settings have more than 50 words.
C. Evolution
To understand the problem of hidden privacy settings over
time, for the 7,058 apps which have privacy settings (collected
in the year of 2017), we downloaded their latest versions (in
2018). Finally, after removing those with no update, 5,485
new versions were successfully collected. For each app pair,
we compare their privacy settings. Interestingly, on one hand,

we ﬁnd 3,110 new privacy settings appear and 1,047 privacy
settings disappear. 36 apps add a new view named Privacy
Settings to organize the privacy settings which scattered in
their previous versions. On the other hand, the number of
hidden privacy settings also increase. For the 5,485 app pairs,
the number of apps with hidden privacy settings increases
from 2,564 (46.75%) to 2,758 (50.28%). Also the number of
hidden privacy settings increases from 5,212 (36.81%) to 6,847
(42.21%). More detailed is shown in Table VII. Apparently, the
developers are working on privacy-related options and provide
more privacy settings for users. In the meanwhile, however,
their current designs still face the usability challenges. Below
we dive into the details and show how privacy settings change
to hidden, or vice versa.
Easy-to-ﬁnd→Hidden. Unfortunately, 226 privacy settings in
158 apps change to hidden even if they are easy-to-ﬁnd in
previous versions. After carefully looking into the settings, we
ﬁnd the causes are the same as those in Table II. When an
app has more functionalities in its newer version, developers
may not appropriately handle the newly added privacy settings,
especially when developers’ main purpose is the usability of
apps. It is hard for them to balance between supporting users
with enough control on privacy and keeping the app to be simple
and easy to use. Further, when developers are under pressure
to release a new version, they might do not have enough time
to design the privacy setting. So they are rush to put privacy
settings into unfamiliar places or use unfamiliar descriptions
without carefully thinking. For example, Photobucket (a popular
photography app with 10 million downloads in Google Play)
has a privacy setting “Share GIFs with Photobucket”. The
developers move the setting from the view titled Settings into
a new view titled Upload Settings in the new version 3.3.8,
which makes it difﬁcult for users to locate the setting.
Hidden→Easy-to-ﬁnd. We are also happy to ﬁnd that 192
privacy settings in 132 apps become easy-to-ﬁnd. Some
developers gather scatted privacy settings to a view and use
an indicator in the Privacy Settings view for guidance. For
example, recall that Hound ﬁnds a hidden privacy setting
