**System information**
  * Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow):
  * OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04):
  * Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
  * TensorFlow installed from (source or binary):
  * TensorFlow version (use command below):
  * Python version: 3.6
  * Bazel version (if compiling from source):
  * GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):
  * CUDA/cuDNN version:
  * GPU model and memory:
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture  
script  
You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with: 1. TF 1.0: `python -c "import
tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"` 2\. TF 2.0: `python -c
"import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"`
**Describe the current behavior**  
Line 76 in tensorflow/python/platform/self_check.py  
except OSError:  
raise ImportError(  
"Could not find %r. TensorFlow requires that this DLL be "  
"installed in a directory that is named in your %%PATH%% "  
"environment variable. Download and install CUDA %s from "  
"this URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive"  
% (build_info.cudart_dll_name, build_info.cuda_version_number))
The URL directs you to version 9 but the current dll checks for version 10.
