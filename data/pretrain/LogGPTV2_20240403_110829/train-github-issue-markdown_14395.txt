##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
1.7
##### Environment:
Centos 6.5
##### Summary:
Duplicate security group names (between different VPCs) cause issues with
instance creation--
When I run the ec2 module to create an instance in a VPC, it doesn't restrict
the Security Group search to that VPC. So if I have the same SG name in 2
different VPCs (maybe bad practice), it can find the wrong one (and fail).
##### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Create 2 VPCs with a subnet
  2. Create a security group in each with the same name
  3. Run: ansible localhost -m ec2 -a "image=ami-fb8e9292 instance_type=m3.medium keypair= group= wait=yes region=us-east-1 vpc_subnet_id=" -c local
  4. If that works, try the other VPC/Subnet
##### Expected Results:
Identify the security group associated with the correct VPC/Subnet and create
the instance
##### Actual Results:
    localhost | FAILED >> {
        "failed": true, 
        "msg": "Instance creation failed => InvalidParameter: Security group sg-xxxxxxx and subnet subnet-xxxxxxx belong to different networks."
    }
