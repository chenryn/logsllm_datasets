### Configuring an Iterator Profile
This section explains how to configure an iterator profile to periodically transmit SLA (Service Level Agreement) measurement packets for delay and loss measurement. You can also view and clear the iterator statistics and configure a remote MEP with an iterator profile.

#### Steps to Create an Iterator Profile
1. **Enter Configuration Mode**:
   ```shell
   [edit]
   user@host# edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring
   ```

2. **Configure the SLA Measurement Monitoring Iterator**:
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring]
   user@host# edit sla-iterator-profiles
   ```

3. **Create an Iterator Profile (e.g., i1)**:
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles]
   user@host# set i1
   ```

4. **(Optional) Configure the Cycle Time**:
   - The cycle time is the interval (in milliseconds) between back-to-back transmissions of SLA frames for one connection.
   - Valid values range from 10 to 3,600,000 ms. The default value is 1000 ms.
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
   user@host# set cycle-time <cycle-time-value>
   ```

5. **(Optional) Configure the Iteration Period**:
   - The iteration period indicates the maximum number of cycles per iteration. The number of connections registered to an iterator cannot exceed this value.
   - Valid values range from 1 to 2000. The default value is 2000.
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
   user@host# set iteration-period <iteration-period-value>
   ```

6. **Configure the Measurement Type**:
   - Choose between loss measurement, statistical frame-loss measurement, or two-way delay measurement.
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
   user@host# set measurement-type (loss | statistical-frame-loss | two-way-delay)
   ```

7. **(Optional) Configure the Calculation Weight for Delay**:
   - Valid values range from 1 to 65,535. The default value is 1 (applicable only for two-way delay measurement).
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
   user@host# set calculation-weight delay <delay-value>
   ```

8. **(Optional) Configure the Calculation Weight for Delay Variation**:
   - Valid values range from 1 to 65,535. The default value is 1 (applicable only for two-way delay measurement).
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
   user@host# set calculation-weight delay-variation <delay-variation-value>
   ```

9. **(Optional) Configure the Threshold Value for Average Frame Delay**:
   - Valid values range from 1 to 4294967295 microseconds. When the configured threshold for average frame delay is exceeded, an SNMP trap is generated.
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
   user@host# set avg-fd-twoway-threshold <avg-fd-twoway-threshold-value>
   ```

10. **(Optional) Configure the Threshold Value for Average Frame Delay Variation**:
    - Valid values range from 1 to 4294967295 microseconds. When the configured threshold for average frame delay variation is exceeded, an SNMP trap is generated.
    ```shell
    [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
    user@host# set avg-ifdv-twoway-threshold <avg-ifdv-twoway-threshold-value>
    ```

11. **(Optional) Configure the Threshold Value for Average Frame Loss Ratio (Forward Direction)**:
    - Valid values range from 1 to 100000 milli-percent. When the configured threshold for average forward frame loss ratio is exceeded, an SNMP trap is generated.
    ```shell
    [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
    user@host# set avg-flr-forward-threshold <avg-flr-forward-threshold-value>
    ```

12. **(Optional) Configure the Threshold Value for Average Frame Loss Ratio (Backward Direction)**:
    - Valid values range from 1 to 100000 milli-percent. When the configured threshold for average backward frame loss ratio is exceeded, an SNMP trap is generated.
    ```shell
    [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
    user@host# set avg-flr-backward-threshold <avg-flr-backward-threshold-value>
    ```

13. **Disable the Iterator Profile**:
    ```shell
    [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles i1]
    user@host# set disable
    ```

14. **Verify the Configuration**:
    ```shell
    [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management performance-monitoring sla-iterator-profiles]
    user@host# show i1
    ```

#### Displaying Iterator Statistics
- **Purpose**: Retrieve and display iterator statistics.
- **Action**:
  - To display the iterator statistics for remote MEP 1 and iterator profile `i1`:
    ```shell
    user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management sla-iterator-statistics sla-iterator i1 maintenance-domain default-1 maintenance-association ma1 local-mep 1 remote-mep 1
    ```

  - To display the iterator statistics for remote MEP 1 and iterator profile `i2`:
    ```shell
    user@host> show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management sla-iterator-statistics sla-iterator i2 maintenance-domain default-1 maintenance-association ma1 local-mep 1 remote-mep 1
    ```
