User: I tried deploying python code using google app engine.
But I got Error Below:

certificate verify failed

I had included proxy certificate in urlfetch_cacerts.py and enabled 'validate_certificate' in urlfetch_stub.py by _API_CALL_VALIDATE_CERTIFICATE_DEFAULT = True.But I still get the error..
Can you suggest any solution?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Upgrading Python to 2.7.8 or later versions fixed the issue.
EDIT: 
Also check if you are using google app engine SDK 1.8.1 or later version. As of version SDK 1.8.1 the cacerts.txt has been renamed to urlfetch_cacerts.txt. You can try removing cacerts.txt file to fix the problem.
