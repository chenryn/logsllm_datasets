ABSTRACT
We present a demo of Odin, an SDN framework to program
enterprise wireless local area networks (WLANs). Enterprise
WLANs need to support a wide range of services and func-
tionalities. This includes authentication, authorization and
accounting, policy, mobility and interference management,
and load balancing. WLANs also exhibit unique challenges.
In particular, access point (AP) association decisions are not
made by the infrastructure, but by clients. In addition, the
association state machine combined with the broadcast na-
ture of the wireless medium requires keeping track of a large
amount of state changes. To this end, Odin builds on a light
virtual AP abstraction that greatly simpliﬁes client manage-
ment. Odin does not require any client side modiﬁcations
and its design supports WPA2 Enterprise. With Odin, a
network operator can implement enterprise WLAN services
as network applications.

INTRODUCTION
Deployments of modern IEEE 802.11 [1] enterprise wire-
less local area networks (WLANs) serve today a multitude
of client devices such as smart-phones, laptops or tablets.
Large deployments provide resilience, fault-tolerance and
fail-over capabilities. Scalability in this context is paramount.
Independent of the size, what most enterprise WLAN de-
ployments have in common is the support for features such
as authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA), pol-

icy management, mobility management, interference man-
agement with dynamic channel reconﬁgurations, load bal-
ancing and providing QoS guarantees. Their management
is usually centralized. These systems are also proprietary,
with each vendor oﬀering its own closed-source platform.
In this paper, we demonstrate Odin1, a software deﬁned
networking (SDN) framework for enterprise WLANs. The
objective of Odin is to empower network operators to pro-
gram and deploy typical enterprise WLAN services and fea-
tures as network applications. In this context, WLANs ex-
hibit speciﬁc challenges. The 802.11 standard lets clients
make AP association decisions on the basis of locally made
decisions. The infrastructure has no control over these deci-
sions made by the client. In addition, the association state
machine at the AP, combined with the dynamic, broadcast
and time-varying nature of the wireless medium can require
to keep track of state information changes continuously. Fur-
thermore, not only associated, but also all interfering 802.11
devices need to be taken into account.
To eﬀectively express applications that implement high-
level services in enterprise WLANs, the programmer needs
simple and powerful abstractions. This is essential if the pro-
grammer operates on a central view of the entire network.
Hence, a design goal of Odin is to prevent the programmer
from keeping track of changes to the authorizer, authen-
ticator and client state machine. Indeed, the programmer
cannot make assumptions about the endpoints of the link
between the client and the infrastructure (MAC and IP ad-
dress). To shield the programmer from this burden and to
simplify the programming model, a central component of
Odin, is the light virtual access point (LVAP) abstraction.
LVAPs virtualize association state and separate them from
the physical AP. Multiple clients connected to a single phys-
ical AP are treated as a set of logically isolated clients con-
nected to diﬀerent ports of a switch. The LVAP abstraction
enables Odin to oﬀer a straighforward programming model.
Typically, an application running on Odin does not need
to directly handle the association state. But LVAPs also
greatly facilitate mobility management, allowing for the in-
frastructure to handoﬀ clients without triggering the client’s
re-association mechanism.

Figure 1: Architecture of Odin. The Odin Master
(an OpenFlow application), speaks OpenFlow to the
switches and the APs, and uses a custom protocol
to talk to each Odin Agent running on APs. Odin
applications use Odin’s primitives to implement en-
terprise speciﬁc services.
Odin is work in progress, under heavy development and
operates under the following assumptions: It targets fully
centralized and reasonably sized deployments with one con-
troller. It does not expect any client side modiﬁcations and
supports WPA2 Enterprise by design. It is fully transpar-
ent to clients, which connect to it as regular IEEE 802.11
stations in infrastructure mode.
2. ODIN: AN SDN FRAMEWORK FOR EN-
TERPRISE WLANS
2.1 Architecture of Odin
Odin’s architecture consists of a single master, multiple
agents and a set of applications (Figure 1). The master itself
is an application on top of an OpenFlow [2] controller. It
has a global view of ﬂows in the network, clients connected
to the network, and the infrastructure that comprises the
network. Odin agents run on the APs. Together, the master
and agents implement a Wi-Fi split-MAC.
2.2 Light Virtual AP (LVAP)
LVAPs are a central primitive within the Odin framework.
When Wi-Fi clients in managed mode scan APs, probe re-
quest messages are generated. APs responding with probe
response messages become potential association candidates.
A client then proceeds to perform a connection handshake
with a locally selected AP. The LVAP abstraction enables to
take control on association decisions from client and leads to
a logical isolation of clients with respect to the 802.11 MAC.
With LVAPs, every client receives a unique BSSID to con-
nect to, i.e, every client is given the illusion of owning its own
AP. In Odin, the LVAP is the client speciﬁc AP. Each physi-
cal AP hosts an LVAP for each connected client. Removing a
client LVAP from a physical AP and spawning it on another
achieves the eﬀect of handing oﬀ a client without the client
performing a re-association, generating additional layer 2 or
3 messages, and most importantly, without requiring any
special software or hardware at the client. Thus, Odin al-
ways provides clients a consistent link to the network, and
the programmer of an Odin application needs not be con-
cerned with how the client’s link to the network changes.
The end-point of a link always corresponds to the client’s
IP and MAC addresses and the unique BSSID assigned by
Odin.
The demo setup will comprise three APs connected via
a switch to a laptop. The APs are x86 based Alix 3D2
boards running OpenWrt with Wistron DNMA92 802.11n
interfaces (Atheros AR9220 chipset). Each AP runs an Odin
agent and the laptop runs the Odin master with a set of
Odin applications. In addition, the laptop will run necessary
services for the demo. Namely, a visualization interface and,
depending on the local availability, an upstream connectivity
through NAT.
Our demo of Odin will display various aspects of a typical
enterprise system.
• A complete Odin deployment with WPA support where
demo attendees can use their own devices as clients.
• Using a visualization interface, we will demonstrate
the inner working of the LVAP concept. It will show
at which physical AP each client is associated by means
of LVAPs. In addition, the visualization interface will
display the various statistics that are collected by the
measurement collection component of Odin. For in-
stance, the received signal strength of diﬀerent clients
as observed at the APs, the noise, and data rates.
• We will demonstrate various Odin applications. In par-
ticular, the mobility manager and the load balancer.
• Demonstration of network slicing based on policies,
such as separation of a guest WiFi network, isolation
of malicious nodes or traﬃc restrictions.
• Demonstrate connection restorations in light of AP
failures using LVAP migrations.
• In order to show the ease with which Odin applica-
tions can be written, we will provide another laptop
to let demo attendees program their own Odin appli-
cations. We will support them and help them to run
their application on our Odin deployment.
4. SUMMARY
There is a large body of work on enterprise WLAN archi-
tectures and system, see for instance [3, 4] and the references
therein. For Odin, these works contain typical applications
that we expect to eventually support.
