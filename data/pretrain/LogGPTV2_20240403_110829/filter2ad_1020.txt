## Abstract
We present a demonstration of Odin, an SDN (Software-Defined Networking) framework designed to program enterprise wireless local area networks (WLANs). Enterprise WLANs must support a wide range of services and functionalities, including authentication, authorization, accounting, policy management, mobility, interference management, and load balancing. These networks face unique challenges, such as the client-driven nature of access point (AP) association decisions and the need to track a large number of state changes due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium.

Odin addresses these challenges by introducing a lightweight virtual AP (LVAP) abstraction, which simplifies client management without requiring any modifications on the client side. Odin is designed to support WPA2 Enterprise, allowing network operators to implement enterprise WLAN services as network applications.

## 1. Introduction
Modern IEEE 802.11 enterprise wireless local area networks (WLANs) serve a variety of client devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Large deployments require resilience, fault tolerance, and fail-over capabilities, with scalability being a critical factor. Regardless of size, most enterprise WLANs support features like authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), policy management, mobility management, interference management, dynamic channel reconfigurations, load balancing, and QoS guarantees. These systems are typically centrally managed and often proprietary, with each vendor offering its own closed-source platform.

In this paper, we demonstrate Odin, an SDN framework for enterprise WLANs. The goal of Odin is to enable network operators to program and deploy typical enterprise WLAN services and features as network applications. One of the key challenges in WLANs is that clients make AP association decisions based on local criteria, and the infrastructure has no control over these decisions. Additionally, the association state machine at the AP, combined with the dynamic and broadcast nature of the wireless medium, requires continuous tracking of state information changes. Furthermore, not only associated but also interfering 802.11 devices need to be considered.

To effectively implement high-level services in enterprise WLANs, programmers need simple and powerful abstractions. This is crucial when operating on a central view of the entire network. Therefore, a design goal of Odin is to shield the programmer from the complexities of the authorizer, authenticator, and client state machines. The light virtual access point (LVAP) abstraction, a central component of Odin, virtualizes association states and separates them from the physical AP. Multiple clients connected to a single physical AP are treated as logically isolated clients connected to different ports of a switch. This abstraction enables a straightforward programming model, where applications do not need to directly handle the association state. LVAPs also facilitate mobility management, allowing the infrastructure to hand off clients without triggering the client's re-association mechanism.

## 2. Odin: An SDN Framework for Enterprise WLANs

### 2.1 Architecture of Odin
Odin's architecture consists of a single master, multiple agents, and a set of applications (Figure 1). The master is an application running on top of an OpenFlow controller, providing a global view of flows, connected clients, and the network infrastructure. Odin agents run on the APs, and together, the master and agents implement a Wi-Fi split-MAC.

### 2.2 Light Virtual AP (LVAP)
LVAPs are a central primitive within the Odin framework. When Wi-Fi clients in managed mode scan APs, they generate probe request messages. APs responding with probe response messages become potential association candidates. A client then performs a connection handshake with a locally selected AP. The LVAP abstraction allows the infrastructure to take control of association decisions, leading to logical isolation of clients with respect to the 802.11 MAC. Each client receives a unique BSSID, giving the illusion of owning its own AP. Each physical AP hosts an LVAP for each connected client. Removing a client LVAP from one physical AP and spawning it on another achieves the effect of handing off a client without the client performing a re-association, generating additional layer 2 or 3 messages, and without requiring any special software or hardware at the client. Thus, Odin always provides a consistent link to the network, and the programmer does not need to be concerned with how the client's link to the network changes. The endpoint of a link always corresponds to the client's IP and MAC addresses and the unique BSSID assigned by Odin.

## 3. Demo Plan
The demo setup will include three APs connected via a switch to a laptop. The APs are x86-based Alix 3D2 boards running OpenWrt with Wistron DNMA92 802.11n interfaces (Atheros AR9220 chipset). Each AP runs an Odin agent, and the laptop runs the Odin master with a set of Odin applications. The laptop will also run necessary services for the demo, including a visualization interface and, depending on local availability, upstream connectivity through NAT.

Our demo of Odin will showcase various aspects of a typical enterprise system:

- **Complete Odin Deployment with WPA Support**: Attendees can use their own devices as clients.
- **Visualization Interface**: Demonstrates the inner workings of the LVAP concept, showing at which physical AP each client is associated and displaying various statistics collected by Odin, such as received signal strength, noise, and data rates.
- **Odin Applications**: We will demonstrate the mobility manager and load balancer.
- **Network Slicing Based on Policies**: Includes separation of a guest WiFi network, isolation of malicious nodes, and traffic restrictions.
- **Connection Restorations**: Showcases AP failure recovery using LVAP migrations.
- **Programming Experience**: Attendees can write and run their own Odin applications on a provided laptop, with support and assistance from our team.

## 4. Summary
There is extensive research on enterprise WLAN architectures and systems, as seen in works like [3] and [4]. For Odin, these works provide typical applications that we aim to support.
