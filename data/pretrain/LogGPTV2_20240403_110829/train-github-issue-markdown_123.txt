## Steps to Reproduce
Use the following code to create tabs for a tab bar:
    Widget _buildTab(String label, Color color) {
        return new Container(
          color: color,
          child: new Flex(
            direction: Axis.horizontal,
            children: [
              new Expanded(
                child: new Container(
                  height: 50.0,
                  child: new Center(
                    child: new Text(
                      label,
                      style: new TextStyle(
                        color: Colors.black,
                        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                        fontSize: 18.0,
                      ),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
    }
## Description
Currently, line 894 of material/tabs.dart uses the constant padding of
`kTabLabelPadding`. Link to source. This applies the padding on the entirety
of the tab in a tab bar, meaning it'll apply padding not only to
text/images/icons but also containers of solid colors. Currently there's no
workaround besides the user fashioning their own tab bar from scratch, which
is tedious considering the simpler and more flexible workaround is to give the
user control via settable field.
