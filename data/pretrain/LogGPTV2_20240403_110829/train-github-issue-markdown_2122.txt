  * Electron version: 1.4
  * Operating system: windows
### Expected behavior
After taking from cookies.get I should be able to use the same output to
cookies.set
### Actual behavior
Error: Setting cookie failed  
at Error (native)
### How to reproduce
When a browser window closes I want to nab it's cookies and store them. I
don't want to use your system because the user might want to export the
cookies and use them on another machine. I'm developing something to allow
people to browse on multiple machines using the same cookies.
    function ChildBrowserClose(e) {
    console.log(e.sender);
        e
            .sender
            .webContents
            .session
            .cookies
            .get({}, (error, cookies) => {
                e.sender.CustomSession.Cookies = JSON.stringify(cookies);
                var Sessions = app
                    .Session
                    .get('Sessions')
                Sessions
                    .find({id: e.sender.CustomSession.id})
                    .assign(e.sender.CustomSession)
                    .value()
                console.log(error, cookies)
            });
    }
* * *
later I try to set with
      for(var i=0;i {
                        console.log(error);
                    });
                }
