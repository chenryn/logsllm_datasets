### Introduction and Methodology

In this section, we outline the methods and tools used in our study to identify and analyze unsolicited SMS messages and calls. Specifically, we utilized Lajidianhua, a well-known mobile application that alerts users to untrusted incoming calls or SMS. We exported its abuse list, which contained 57,441 numbers. Additionally, we wrote scripts to search for occurrences of these source numbers on Google to find any evidence of their misuse.

### Results and Analysis

Overall, 77.47% of the unsolicited numbers recorded by MobiPot were not reported in the three public sources we accessed. When excluding abs1 and abs2, which were seeded via Lajidianhua, the percentage increased to 89%. This indicates that MobiPot has opened up a new and effective avenue for identifying sources of unsolicited SMS messages and calls, complementing existing technologies in understanding and defending against such attacks.

### Case Studies

#### 5.1 Re-using Mobile Numbers

In a large country like China, it is common for previously allocated and terminated mobile numbers to be reassigned to new subscribers. This can be problematic for the new subscriber, as they may receive calls and messages intended for the previous owner. For our honeycards, this issue had a dual impact:

- **Legitimate Calls and Messages:** Legitimate calls and messages intended for the previous owner add to the pool of data that needs to be identified and filtered. For example, we identified two different numbers calling and sending messages to nsd2, asking for the same person, which we believe are likely legitimate.
- **Security Risks:** Attackers may pretend to be the previous owner and request one-time passwords, attempting to compromise two-factor authentication systems. We found 22 such requests, with 18 for Alipay and 4 for QQ. For instance, soc2 received a verification message from Tencent, which posed a security risk for the new subscriber.

#### 5.2 Sophisticated Scamming

We discovered a potentially scamming call that appears to be the first step in a sophisticated scam. In this scenario, the caller pretends to be a high-ranking official and demands that the victim visit their office. On the way, the victim receives a second call directing them to a secretary to handle banking issues. This confirms that such scams are well-organized and multi-step processes.

### Social Graph Analysis

Our analysis of the social graph based on the content of the messages revealed several key insights:

- **Multiple Sources per Campaign:** Attackers use multiple numbers to perform their attacks, confirming our intuition.
- **Common Sources Between Campaigns:** There are shared sources between different campaigns, suggesting that the same attacker may run multiple campaigns.
- **Multiple HoneyCards Targeted:** Some campaigns target multiple honeycards, indicating that attackers use various methods to identify potential victims.

These findings suggest that telephony-based attacks are complex and organized, similar to cyber-attacks on the Internet. MobiPot is useful in collecting evidence of such activities and provides a first step in better understanding and defending against them.

### Complementing Current Technology

Our deployment of MobiPot was effective in recording many unsolicited SMS messages and calls. By cross-checking the unsolicited source numbers with public databases, we found that MobiPot identified many new numbers not previously reported. This highlights the value of MobiPot in complementing existing technologies and improving the overall understanding of telephony threats.

### Attacks Specifically Targeting Mobile Users

A primary objective of the mobile telephony honeypot is to collect evidence of attacks targeting mobile users. We found more than 10 cases where the same attacker made phone calls and sent SMS messages with similar content. For example, one number (18069953481) called and then sent an SMS message requesting QQ account details under the pretext of a refund. This demonstrates how SMS can be used to launch more sophisticated attacks compared to traditional landline installations.

### Other Seeding Technologies

We also explored other seeding technologies that could provide incentives for fraudsters to scrape or steal phone numbers. These include:

- **Public Discussion Forums:** Posting phone numbers on public forums like USENET.
- **Do Not Call (DNC) Lists:** Using DNC lists as a source of phone numbers.
- **Questionable Websites:** Targeting websites in categories such as drugs, gambling, and adult content.
- **Advertisements:** Posting honeycards in advertisements on sites like Craigslist.
- **Free Services:** Using websites offering free services, such as music, ringtones, and coupons.

### Conclusions

In this work, we introduced the first mobile telephony honeypot, MobiPot. We implemented and seeded honeycards in three distinct ways, attracting previously unknown fraudsters. Overall, we collected 1,021 SMS messages from 215 senders and 634 calls from 413 callers, with over half being unsolicited. Our investigation into the biggest contributors, threat classification, and connectivity among SMS senders, along with the case studies, provides valuable insights into the nature of mobile telephony threats.
