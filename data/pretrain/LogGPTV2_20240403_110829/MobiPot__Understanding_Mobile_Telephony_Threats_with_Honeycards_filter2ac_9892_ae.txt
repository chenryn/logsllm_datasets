particular, Lajidianhua. We also installed Sogou Haoma9, a
popular mobile application that informs the user whether
the incoming call or SMS is untrusted, and exported its
abuse list consisting of 57,441 numbers. Lastly, we wrote
scripts to search occurrences of these source numbers on
Google to ﬁnd any evidence of the abuse of them.
Overall, 77.47% of the unsolicited numbers recorded by
MobiPot were unreported in three public sources we ac-
cessed. The percentage goes up to 89% when excluding abs1
and abs2 which were seeded via Lajidianhua (also used for
this measurement). This suggests that MobiPot opened up
a new and eﬀective avenue in ﬁnding sources of unsolicited
SMS messages and calls, and could potentially be used to
complement existing technologies in better understanding
and defending against the attacks.

5. CASE STUDIES
Besides the main results presented in the previous section,
we also ﬁnd some interesting cases that we believe are worth
sharing. In particular, we report cases that are speciﬁc to
mobile phone users which are not found in existing work of
telephone-based honeypots [13].
5.1 Re-using Mobile Numbers
In a big country like China, it is not uncommon that pre-
viously allocated and terminated mobile numbers are re-
assigned to new subscribers. This is annoying to the new
subscriber since she might receive calls and messages in-
tended for the ex-owner; when it happens to our honeycards,
the eﬀect is two-fold.
On one hand, legit calls and messages intended for the
ex-owner add to the pool of those that need to be identiﬁed
and ﬁltered for the purpose of analyzing unsolicited ones.
For example, we identiﬁed two diﬀerent numbers calling and
sending messages to nsd2 asking for the same person, which
we believe to be highly likely legit calls and messages to
the ex-owner. On the other hand, attackers may pretend
to be the ex-owner and, e.g., request one-time passwords
to be forwarded to the pretended ex-owner as an attempt to
compromise the two-factor authentication system. We found
22 requests of this type via SMS, out of which 18 were for
Alipay and 4 were for QQ. For example, soc2 received the
following veriﬁcation message:
[Tencent] Veriﬁcation code 658339. Use it to change the
password of the QQ number 64******5. Leaking the veriﬁ-
cation code has a risk. The QQ Security Center.
Clearly, this represents a security issue for the new sub-
scriber.
5.2 Sophisticated Scamming
We found a potentially scamming call that appears to
be the ﬁrst step of a sophisticated scam earlier reported in
China10. In this ﬁrst step of the attack, the caller pretends
to be the big boss of the victim and demands that the victim
visit his oﬃce the next morning. On the way to meet the
“big boss”, the victim will receive a second call directing her
to the secretary of the big boss to settle banking accounts
for commission or reimbursement issues ﬁrst.

Figure 5: Social graph of campaigns and honeycards
based on content of the messages
campaign. This conﬁrms our intuition that attackers
use multiple numbers to perform their attacks.
• There are common sources between campaigns (an edge
between the two campaigns targeting mal2). This sug-
gest that there are multiple campaigns run by the same
attacker.
• There are campaigns that target multiple honeycards
(e.g., the same campaign targeting both mal2 and soc2.
This suggests that attackers may use multiple ways of
identifying potential victim numbers.
Our ﬁndings suggest that the attacks exploiting the tele-
phony channel are complicated and organized activities, sim-
ilar with cyber-attacks conducted on the Internet. We be-
lieve that MobiPot is useful in collecting evidence of such
organized activities and the data collected as well as analy-
sis like this provide a ﬁrst step in better understanding them.
Note that, we only show campaigns in Figure 5 which have
multiple sources.
4.8 Complementing Current Technology
Our deployment of MobiPot has been eﬀective in record-
ing many unsolicited SMS messages and calls with the eﬀec-
tive seeding of honeycards. In this subsection, we correlate
the ﬁndings with existing technologies, namely, public com-
plaint lists, to see if there are new numbers found.
We cross-checked the unsolicited source numbers obtained
on MobiPot with public databases of complaint numbers, in
2abs22soc11nsd2soc22mal24nsd152mal1222227325.3 Attacks Speciﬁcally Targeting Mobile Users
A primary objective of the mobile telephony honeypot is
to collect evidence of attacks targeting mobile users. For
example, in a scenario reported in the previous subsection,
the scam took place when the victim was on the move to
meet the “big boss”. In general, all attacks employing short
message services are mobile victim speciﬁc. SMS enables the
attacker to launch more sophisticated attacks that might not
be possible against traditional landline installations. In this
section, we report cases where an attacker uses both call and
SMS to conduct the attack.
We found more than 10 scamming cases where the same
attacker makes phone calls and at the same time sends SMS
messages, with contents of the call and SMS message being
about the same. As an example, 18069953481 gave on Dec.
30th a ﬁrst call with the pretext of knowing her peer. A cou-
ple of minutes after, the same source sent a message asking
for QQ messaging’s account details with the excuse of re-
funding some credit. Lately during the day, we received an
additional call from the same number in which the author
asked if the message was received and demanding for the
messaging account, including personal name and surname.
There were also six cases where the attacker started with
a casual conversation regarding some transactions, and then
followed with an SMS message that gave the account num-
bers for bank transfers or instant messaging. Intuitively, this
is to take advantage of SMS in its clarity and convenience in
sharing large numbers that are hard to memorize. For ex-
ample, 13691049676 performed three social-engineered calls
before sending an SMS message with the information for the
money deposit on Alipay.
6. OTHER SEEDING TECHNOLOGIES
In this section, we brieﬂy present other seeding technolo-
gies that potentially provide incentives for fraudsters to scrape
or steal phone numbers. Due to various constraints, espe-
cially the limited number of honeycards we have, we did
not implement these techniques and leave them for further
investigation in future work.
Figure 6: Prominent seeding targets for MobiPot
• Public Discussion Forums: Posting phone numbers
on public forums like USENET is another way of seed-
ing the honeycards on the web. The discussion groups
in USENET are ranked by the largest number of arti-
cles read, largest number of articles posted, and largest
of bytes posted, etc.
• DNC List: The Do Not Call lists or registry is a list of
personal phone numbers which the telemarketers are
prohibited from calling. However, this list is poten-
tially another source of phone numbers for fraudsters.
Therefore, some numbers can be posted on DNC lists
of the country where the MobiPot is setup.
• Questionable websites: Websites in a few categories
are more likely to be scraped by fraudsters. Such cate-
gories include those of drugs, gambling, and adult dat-
ing, porn, or sex related sites. Most of these sites are
known to be spam/malware intensive and thus come
under the classiﬁcation of “questionable”.
• Advertisements: Advertisement websites which may
have widespread use like Craigslist is also a viable
target. Researchers had showed how Nigerian scam-
mers target Craigslist to harvest phone numbers [29].
Craigslist has numerous sections devoted to jobs, hous-
ing, community, gigs, resumes, and discussion forums.
Thus, another option is posting advertisements with
honeycards in such websites. However, since such sites
have legitimate usage, it is important that the adver-
tisement does not attract the legitimate users. Alter-
natively, phone numbers could be publicized by ﬁlling
in fake details in the advertisement forms that pop up
while visiting particular websites or during URL redi-
rection.
• Free Services: Websites oﬀering free services are
other places from which the phone numbers are likely
to be harvested. These sites may give free music, free
ringtones, free or discounted coupons, etc. Some sites
may oﬀer rewards to ﬁll out surveys, in which case it
is important to distinguish between the legitimate and
illegitimate survey sites.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we introduced the ﬁrst mobile telephony hon-
eypot. We implemented this mobile telephony honeypot sys-
tem with honeycards in a real system called MobiPot. We
seeded these honeycards in three distinct ways and stud-
ied the eﬀectiveness of the seeding mechanisms in attracting
previously unknown fraudsters.
Overall, we collected 1,021 SMS messages from 215 senders
and 634 calls from 413 callers. We conﬁrmed that over
half of them were unsolicited. We investigated the biggest
contributors, classiﬁed threats, and studied the connectivity
among SMS senders. Finally, we also described a number
of interesting cases that we hope will help us gain a better
understanding regarding how mobile telephony threats are
conducted.
