Question: "An adversary is planning to perform an Ingress Tool Transfer to a victim network. What could be the reasons for choosing `certutil` and `curl` as the preferred utilities for this operation? (Choose two)"
 "A": "`certutil` and `curl` are less likely to trigger antivirus software compared to downloading files directly from the internet."
 "B": "`certutil` and `curl` are typically not found on victim systems, thus their presence can alert defenders to unauthorized activities."
 "C": "These utilities can be used to obfuscate the transfer process, making it harder for defenders to detect the malicious activity."
 "D": "These utilities are often restricted by firewall rules, making them an unlikely choice for transferring tools into a compromised environment."
