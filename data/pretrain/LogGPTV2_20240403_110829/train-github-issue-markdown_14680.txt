I have npm scripts for all my build tasks. How do I run these from Code? To be
honest it's not a major problem switching to a console but it would be nice to
run from within code.
I would have thought this was a candidate for standard behaviour shipped with
code?
I looked at creating tasks and the output processor but got quite lost. For
example there seems to be only one task allowed.
