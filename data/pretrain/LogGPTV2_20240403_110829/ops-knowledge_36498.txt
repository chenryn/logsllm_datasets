User: I've been using Python for a long time and have numerous scripts running all over my office. I use a few in particular scripts to back up then delete data. In these script I use os.remove function.
My question is: Where does the os.remove function delete items to?

Does it delete them right off the HD?
I know they don't go to the recycle bin
Does it simply remove the item's link, but keep it on the HD somehow?
Assistant: os.remove
will call the operating system's unlink functionality, and delete the file from the disk.
Technically the OS/filesystem probably just marks the sectors as free, and removes the file entry from the directory, but that's up to the filesystem implementation.
