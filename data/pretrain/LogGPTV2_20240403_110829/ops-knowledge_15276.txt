User: I am having some trouble getting appscript installed on OS/X 10.6.3 / Python 2.6.1. When I issue
sudo easy_install appscript
I get "unable to execute gcc-4.2: No such file or directory".  Even when I do export CC=/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 (a valid gcc-4.2 executable), easy_install barks.
What could be the issue?
Disclaimer: OS/X newbie at the helm...
Assistant: I don't think the solution proposed is sufficient in many cases, as (for example) I already have the tools in /usr/bin and get the same error.
The problem is that gcc is being invoked with an -arch ppc flag, which generally is not supported any longer.
You need to (a)
  set ARCHFLAGS in the shell environment so that is it 
  something like '-arch i386 -arch x86_64'
or for (b) for a permanent fix:
edit 
 /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python*/distutils/sysconfig.py
to change 
   archflags = '-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch x86_64'
or be 
   archflags = '-arch i386 -arch x86_64'
