User: I have a python appengine app that uses full text search.  The document model has something like
title: title
abstract: short abstract
full text: lots and lots of text
If someone searches for a string, I want it ordered such that score for matches in title >> abstract >> full text.  There doesn't seem to be a way to do this with the exiting scoring options, am I out of luck?
Assistant: Unfortunately yes; we don't yet have a way for you to weight different fields more or less than others. Sorry!
