Question: Given an application that must handle sensitive information in memory, which of the following code snippets correctly implements a mechanism to prevent sensitive data from being swapped to disk, and which one does not account for the specific platform limitations detailed in the description?
"A": "On a Linux system, a call to mlock() is made for sensitive data pages, followed by error checking to handle the case when locking fails.",
"B": "For a Windows 98 application, VirtualLock() is used to ensure sensitive data will not be swapped to disk, without any return value verification.",
"C": "On a POSIX-compliant system, mlock() is used for sensitive data with the assumption that it will not be swapped to disk, and supervisor privileges are not considered.",
"D": "An application uses VirtualLock() on a modern Windows system and verifies the function's success via return value, accounting for the possibility of failure."
