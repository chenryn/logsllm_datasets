I want to integrate my Flutter module into my existing app. I follow this link
for a tutorial but it requires me to copy dart codes and assets into my
existing project. That's not good. Is there any way to encapsulate my Flutter
module as a Framework? and I can use that Framework without setting Flutter
environment in my existing project.
