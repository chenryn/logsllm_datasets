User: I'm new to scons and Python.
I was wondering if there's a way to invoke scons from within a python script. 
My python script accepts from the user, a list of directories where the code to be compiled together is located (in addition to doing some other non-trivial things).
It also generates a string which is to be used as a name of the executable created
by scons.
I want to pass this information from my python script to scons, and then invoke scons.
Is there a simple way to do this?
I can think of the following possibilities:

use subprocess.call("scons"...) I'm not sure if scons accepts all the info I need to pass as command line arguments
have the python script write into a file. Have the SConscript parse the file and get the information passed.
Assistant: Well, I guess it's possible in theory. The scons executable itself is just a python script and all it does is execute SCons.Script.main() after modifying the sys.path variable. But you would probably have to start digging deep into the source to really understand how to make it do things you want.
A much cleaner solution is calling your script from the SConscript file, which is probably the intended usage and should prove much easier.
