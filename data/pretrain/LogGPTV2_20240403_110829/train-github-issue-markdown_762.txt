I've been noticing lately that matplotlib's SVG output appears with incorrect
clipping in a lot of SVG viewers (rsvg-view, Ristretto, gpicview), even though
it does appear correctly in good SVG viewers like inkscape, firefox, chrome.
The data curves peek outside of the axes. Luckily there is an fix in
matplotlib that should be easy enough to implement:
Currently, the SVG structure looks more or less like this, with the clipPath
defined at the end:
      .... curves drawn in here, referencing clip-path p7ff5b81e1d
I found that if I simply moved the section containing that clipPath earlier in
the file, then the SVG views just fine in any viewer that I can find. I guess
that these basic SVG viewers don't like forward references.
For examples, this works:
      .... curves drawn in here, referencing clip-path p7ff5b81e1d
I would attach an example SVG but github doesn't seem to support that...
