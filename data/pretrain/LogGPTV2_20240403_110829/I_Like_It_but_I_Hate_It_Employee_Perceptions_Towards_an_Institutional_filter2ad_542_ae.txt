from the top level and not branch out to employee levels.”
Our participants seemed to be adamant in their stance that ad-
ditional security requirements added to their devices would be
deemed unacceptable. While we had participants willing to argue
for both sides for some components of the DuoMobile system, it
is apparent that although many are willing to accept the use of a
third-party app on their phones for work, these same people are
not willing to accept further intervention on their personal devices
from the institution.
6 LIMITATIONS
When measuring concepts such as perceived usability, relative ad-
vantage, or compatibility, specifically for the DuoMobile app, we
recognize that an app is merely a component of an entire smart-
phone ecosystem. Pre-existing prejudices or usability concerns that
the participants may have had towards their mobile phones may
have been inadvertently applied to some components of app usabil-
ity as well. Further, despite there being several ways (beyond the
DuoMobile app) for users within this new system to authenticate
themselves (SMS codes, phone calls), a large majority of our partic-
ipants used the DuoMobile app only. As only 6 participants in our
study utilized the phone call method to authenticate themselves,
we are hesitant to make any strong statements about the impact of
various authentication methods within this new 2FA system. Lastly,
we note that we can only comment on the results of our surveyed
participants, and lack campus-wide data on authentication tech-
niques used by the entire university (token vs. DuoMobile), as this
data was not made available to us by the university.
7 CONCLUSION
Using an in-depth survey, as well as discussions with members of
an institutional administration, we explored usability and adoption
concerns within a new second-factor authentication framework
utilizing BYOD. We also examined various factors within this BYOD
framework that led to feelings of resentment towards the institution,
as well as unforeseen workplace consequences. Our study is the
first that we know of to examine a transition between two 2FA
systems with a BYOD framework within an institution.
We found that, overall, surveyed individuals found that ease of
use was greater for the more traditional token over DuoMobile for
second-factor authentication. Conversely, DuoMobile was found to
be more compatible with the workflow of the participants. While
overall perceptions of the DuoMobile authentication system were
not inherently negative, there were several factors that contributed
to the system being rated more negatively in terms of ease of use
(significantly) and relative advantage (non-significantly) than its
traditional token-based counterpart. A number of these concerns
were based on BYOD issues of compensation for personal device
usage, a feeling of unprofessionalism using a personal device for
work in certain contexts, and job restrictions hindering the use of
personal devices within work environments. We note that system
designers should consider alternative workflows for individuals
who have workplace restrictions on personal phone usage. Failure
to do so could result in employees being unable to complete their
work and growing discord. Additionally, some individuals may
place some resentment on an institution if a BYOD policy is imple-
mented without compensation to the employees. This resentment
could be amplified if an institution would ever choose to require
any additional mandated security features be placed on personal
devices (such as password requirements, remote tracking/wiping,
etc.), which has been known to occur.
Additionally, we found that how a novel 2FA technology is intro-
duced (mandated vs. perceived as voluntary) has a fairly substantial
impact on how that new technology is perceived and accepted in
terms of ease of use (of the previous system), and relative advantage
and compatibility (of the new system). We note that these concerns
have not been discussed in detail before, to the best of our knowl-
edge, in literature related to BYOD. Administrators should strive, to
the best of their ability, to encourage independent adoption of in-
stitutional technologies, as employees are more likely to positively
respond. This could include giving employees more time to adopt a
technology on their own, or creating better literature to describe
inherent benefits of newly introduced technologies (if there are
newly inherent benefits).
Revisiting our findings in support of token use, we still argue
that a second-factor authentication system, such as DuoMobile, is
a suitable replacement to more traditional, token-based 2FA con-
figurations. While users of such a system may not support such a
change initially, they also tend to recognize why such a change is
occurring and ultimately support it. Users of a digital 2FA system
find that it falls more in-line with their workflow, and have less
concerns about misplacing a phone compared to a token.
As second-factor authentication technologies continue to be
introduced in the private and corporate sector, the need to better
understand user reactions towards these systems becomes more
important. In this paper, we showed that while users report aspects
that they dislike about 2FA technologies, they also acknowledge
the benefits and typically incorporate said technologies into their
workflow to further secure themselves, as well as any institution
they may work for.

A APPENDIX
A.1 Duo Token
This image below shows a physical two-factor authentication (2FA)
token. An individual would carry this device with them, and be
asked to enter the randomly generated number displayed on this
device, as they would log in to a system. This number typically
changes every 30-60 seconds, and is generally based on proprietary
algorithms.
A.2 Duo Mandated Enrollment
At the Pennsylvania State University university, if you had not
enrolled in DuoMobile by your department’s mandated date, upon
attempting to log in to any system, this message was shown. You
were required to enroll in the system before being given access to
any major system.
A.3 Duo Web Login
This appendix item illustrates the new, 2FA login process at the
Pennsylvania State University. After entering standard username/
password credentials, users are taken to this page where they can
either instantiate a ’Duo Push’ to dynamically approve the login,
receive an automated phone call from Duo, or use a pre-generated
passcode sent via SMS. Upon completing any one of these three
actions, the user is authenticated to the network.
