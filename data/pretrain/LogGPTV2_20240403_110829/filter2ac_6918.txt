**ATT&CK ID:** M1037  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Filter Network Traffic

**Description:**
VNC (Virtual Network Computing) typically uses the following default TCP ports:
- **5900** for the VNC server.
- **5800** for browser-based access.
- **5500** for a VNC viewer in listening mode.

By filtering or blocking these ports, you can effectively restrict VNC traffic that relies on these default settings. This measure can help mitigate unauthorized remote access and enhance network security.
