User: I was wondering whether it would be possible to write a python script that retrieves header information from an .exe file. I tried googling but didn't really find any results that were usable.
Thanks.

Assistant: Of course it is possible to write a Python script to retrieve header information from an XYZ file. Three simple steps:
(1) Find docs for the header part of an XYZ file; read them.
(2) Read the docs for the Python struct module or ctypes module or both.
(3) Write and test the script.
Which step are you having trouble with?
