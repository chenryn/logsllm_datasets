Abstract. Global access to the Internet for all requires a dramatic
reduction in Internet access costs particularly in developing areas. This
access is often achieved through several proxy gateways shared across
local or regional access networks. These proxies allow individuals or
organisations to share the capacity of their Internet connection with
other users. We present a measurement study of a crowdsourced Inter-
net proxy service in the guiﬁ.net community network that provides free
Web access to a large community with many small proxy servers spread
over the network. The dataset consists of Squid proxy logs for one month,
combined with network topology and traﬃc data. Our study focuses on
a representative subset of the whole network with about 900 nodes and
roughly 470 users of the web proxy service. We analyse the service from
three viewpoints: Web content traﬃc from users, performance of proxies
and inﬂuence of the access network. We ﬁnd clear daily patters of usage,
excess capacity and little reuse of content which makes caching almost
unnecessary. We also ﬁnd variations and small ineﬃciencies in the dis-
tribution of traﬃc load across proxies and the access network, related to
the locality and manual proxy choice. Finally, users experience an over-
all usable Internet access with good throughput for a free crowdsourced
service.

1 Introduction
The majority of the world’s population does not have any or an adequate Internet
access [12], implying that the Internet cannot provide service and reach everyone
without discrimination. Global access to the Internet for all requires a dramatic
reduction in Internet access costs especially in geographies and populations with
low penetration [9]. Community Networks (WMNs) [17] allow local communi-
ties to build their own network infrastructures and provide aﬀordable inter-
networking with the Internet including the deepest rural communities world-
wide [15]. Internet companies have also tried to address the digital divide with

initiatives such as Facebook’s FreeBasics [16] or the Google Global Cache. Shar-
ing resources, such as local access infrastructure or global Internet transport, is
encouraged at all levels [7,11] to lower the cost of network infrastructures and
Internet services.
Among many other community networks, guiﬁ.net exempliﬁes how regional
communities can develop their own network infrastructures governed as a com-
mons [2], using wired and wireless links to create a regional IP network, and
sharing several Internet gateways among all their participants. These gateways
are usually web proxies for Web access, the most popular traﬃc, but can accom-
modate other traﬃc through HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS or tunneling. Proxies,
not exempt from the drawbacks of middleboxes, have also additional advan-
tages: some content and DNS resolution can be shared in caches, and most
important, proxies can protect the privacy of end users if they trust the proxy
provider. Access to the Internet through Web proxy gateways relies on individ-
uals or organisations sharing the full or spare capacity of its Internet connection
with other guiﬁ.net users. However, these crowdsourced gateway nodes have lim-
ited processing and Internet transfer capacity and might be overloaded by the
demand.
In this paper we contribute an analysis of a large crowdsourced proxy service
in a regional community network. A large population of C clients can browse the
Web taking advantage of the aggregated capacity of a pool of P contributed web
proxies, with C > P, spread over a regional network infrastructure, at a fraction
of the cost of C Internet connections.
We ﬁrst describe the guiﬁ.net network, its proxy service and the collected
datasets in Sect. 2. Then we analyse the service from three viewpoints: (1) ser-
vice usage by end-users: patterns of usage and content in Sect. 3, (2) the proxy,
Sect. 4, in terms of caching, users, performance and variability, and (3) the local
network, Sect. 5, in terms of topology and usage. Our measurements describe the
eﬀectiveness of a simple setup of a regional network sharing a set of Web proxies
in delivering free basic Web access to a large population.
2 The guiﬁ.net Proxy Service
guiﬁ.net is an open, free, and neutral network built by citizens and organisa-
tions pooling their resources to build and operate a local network infrastructure,
governed as a common pool resource [2]. The network infrastructure is mostly
wireless [17] with a ﬁber backbone. Participants can extend the network to reach
new locations and use it to access intranet services like the web proxy service.
The most popular application in community networks is web access and
guiﬁ.net is no exception. Web proxy nodes connected both to guiﬁ.net and an
ISP act as free gateways to the Internet to the community network users. Prox-
ies run on simple servers and take advantage of individuals or organisations
(like libraries or municipalities) oﬀering their Internet access to other guiﬁ.net
users. Using web proxies, public entities can provide free Internet access without
infringing telecom market competence regulations. While some of the web prox-
ies are kept as a private service, 356 out of the 477 registered web proxy servers in
74

the network (May 2016) are shared with all the network registered participants
(12,500). A registered member is allowed to use any proxy of their convenience,
although recommended to use one nearby. Users can select or change its choice
based on quality of experience. Therefore, while some proxies may become pop-
ular and highly used, others may remain underused.
Data collection: For our analysis we chose to study the Llucanes guiﬁ.net
zone, a region in the Osona county of Catalunya, Spain. As explained in [6], this
zone is representative of other rural guiﬁ.net networks. Furthermore, Llucanes
is the only guiﬁ.net zone with published anonymized logs for all (four) involved
operational proxies. Even-day proxy log entries anonymise the client IP address
and show information about the requested URLs, while odd-day proxy logs show
the opposite. We assisted in the preparation and publication of these logs. The
logs combined with other openly accessible information about network topology,
network links and network traﬃc information, provide a consistent and complete
view of this regional network.
3 Service Usage Viewpoint
The behavior of the users and the service can be described at macro-level as a
set of time series concerning metrics that can be extracted from the monthly
logs, namely bytes per request, number of requests and number of users.
The traﬃc time series for the aggregate set of proxies shows a daily repeti-
tive pattern, but also strong aperiodic negative spikes, which were statistically
veriﬁed as a dominant period of 1 day, and the second largest peak at 12 h.
Service usage: The majority of the traﬃc is due to a relatively small number
of large requests (20% of the requests produce 97% of the traﬃc), while the
rest of the requests present little variation in size. Additionally, as expected,
the majority of the traﬃc (90%) is created by 15% of the users. However, in
contrast to the distribution of request size, the distribution of traﬃc and number
of requests per user varies exponentially across users. For the analysis of the
service processing rate we calculated the request processing throughput as
the bits per time elapsed for each request, depicted in Fig. 1, ranging from less
than 107 for the worst 10% to at least 108 for more than 80% of the requests.
Content analysis: Using the even-day proxy logs we looked at the request
types and target URL of the users’ requests. The majority of the traﬃc, almost
50%, consists of HTTP CONNECT requests, which is the method to establish
TCP tunnels over HTTP, mostly all HTTPS which is indisputably the main
usage appearing in the logs. While for HTTP CONNECT we cannot know the
corresponding content type, the most common type for the rest of the requests
is the generic application/* with 23%, followed by video/* (19%) and image/*
(5.5%).
The traﬃc for all analysed proxies in Table 1, including HTTP CONNECT,
shows that the top video portal traﬃc occupies 36% of the traﬃc, which is an
impressive large amount. For completeness, we mention that this is not reﬂected

in the number of requests, therefore it is attributed on the size of the objects
requested. Since video is by far the HTTP type with most traﬃc, it is not
surprising to ﬁnd that 4 out of 10 top domains are video portals. We also found
that the distribution of web traﬃc per URL can roughly approximate a Zipf
distribution, equivalent to results in [14] with domestic Internet connections.
4 The Proxy Viewpoint
In this section we investigate the capabilities and inﬂuence of the proxy servers
involved. Our dataset concerns the only 4 proxies operating in the Llucanes zone.
Table 2 shows the CPU and RAM characteristics of the proxy servers, as well as
the nominal maximum throughput of the Internet connection they oﬀer. They
are very diverse, with great diﬀerences in Internet throughput (4–80 Mbps). We
also observe that proxy 11252 has the slowest combined characteristics. Despite
that these servers provide other services, e.g. SNMP, the interference caused by
other services is expected to be negligible.

The analysis of logs for the four proxies is summarized in Table 3. The values
are averages for each proxy over a month of daily logs. The ﬁrst group of columns
(Diﬀerent data) shows a data object storage perspective, with the amount of
diﬀerent data objects requested (disregarding the number of requests for each).
The second group (Data transferred) shows a data transfer perspective, with
the amount of traﬃc in each category. The third group shows data transfer
ratios to the total transferred. We distinguish between “All” content, seen or
transferred by the proxy, content requested repeatedly (same URL, cacheable
or not), content served from the cache (checked or not against the server), and
content that is invisible (Connect method, typically HTTPS, passed through
blindly).
Cache eﬀectiveness: As introduced before, the passed-through content
(HTTPS) represents the majority of the proxy traﬃc (49.4–64%). Although
URLs repeat signiﬁcantly (6.4–36% of proxy traﬃc), the content successfully
served from the cache (after validation or not) only represents a negligible
amount (1–1.6%). Considering the number of requests instead of the amount
of data, despite URLs repeat often (20–41%), the content does not seem cache
friendly, as cache hits only represent a very small portion (3–10%). The analysis
in number of requests compared to byte count indicates that cached content
usually corresponds to small objects. Bad cache performance can be attributed
to characteristics of the proxy service, such as small cache size, small number
of concurrent users per proxy, or to increasingly non-cacheable served content.
We next look at how these apply to our scenario, claiming that non-cacheable
content is the main factor aﬀecting cache performance.
Cache size: As far as the cache size, the default allocated cache size in guiﬁ.net
proxy settings is 10 GB of secondary storage, while in some proxies caching is
not even enabled. However, we discovered that cached content that results in
cache hits only accounts for a maximum of 151 MB (if all repeated URLs were
cacheable) and an average of 61 MB (based on cache HITs) of data per day. In the
extreme case where all content were cacheable and discounting the transparent
CONNECT/HTTPS data, the amount of daily data seen (i.e. all content for
all URL seen) accounts for a maximum of 1.5 GB or 801 MB on average, easily
achievable with RAM-based caches.

Fig. 2. Rank of URLs by number of clients requesting them per proxy
Sharing across clients: Proxies can provide the beneﬁt of sharing network
resources, reusing not only HTTP content, but also reusing DNS resolution data
as client web browsers delegate, or even reusing (pooling) established TCP con-
nections among diﬀerent clients. Figure 2 shows the popularity of URLs across
diﬀerent clients in each proxy over a month, with top values between 60 to 212
diﬀerent clients accessing each given URL. The number is related to the struc-
ture of the service, with many decentralized proxies with few users each and
no inter-cache cooperation, which limits the potential of sharing cached content
across more users.
Proxy selection: Users are instructed to check the public list of nearby prox-
ies (in their network zone) in the public network management directory of the
community network with shows a list of nearby proxies, including status and
availability ratio, or follow the advice of trusted neighbors with previous usage
