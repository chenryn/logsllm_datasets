## Abstract
Global access to the Internet, especially in developing areas, requires a significant reduction in Internet access costs. This is often achieved through shared proxy gateways across local or regional networks, allowing individuals or organizations to share their Internet connection with other users. This paper presents a measurement study of a crowdsourced Internet proxy service in the guifi.net community network, which provides free web access to a large community using many small proxy servers distributed throughout the network. The dataset includes Squid proxy logs for one month, combined with network topology and traffic data. Our study focuses on a representative subset of the network with approximately 900 nodes and around 470 users of the web proxy service. We analyze the service from three perspectives: user-generated web content traffic, proxy performance, and the influence of the access network. We find clear daily usage patterns, excess capacity, and minimal content reuse, making caching almost unnecessary. Additionally, we observe variations and minor inefficiencies in the distribution of traffic load across proxies and the access network, related to locality and manual proxy selection. Overall, users experience usable Internet access with good throughput for a free, crowdsourced service.

## 1. Introduction
A significant portion of the world's population lacks adequate Internet access, highlighting the need for cost-effective solutions, particularly in underdeveloped regions [12]. Community Networks (WMNs) [17] enable local communities to build and manage their own network infrastructures, providing affordable Internet access even in remote rural areas [15]. Initiatives like Facebook’s FreeBasics [16] and Google Global Cache aim to address the digital divide by encouraging resource sharing at all levels [7, 11], thereby reducing the cost of network infrastructure and Internet services.

Guifi.net is an exemplary community network where regional communities develop their own network infrastructures, governed as a commons [2]. It uses wired and wireless links to create a regional IP network, sharing multiple Internet gateways among participants. These gateways, typically web proxies, are used for web access, the most popular type of traffic, and can also handle other types of traffic via HTTP CONNECT, SOCKS, or tunneling. Proxies offer advantages such as content and DNS resolution sharing through caches and enhanced privacy for end-users who trust the proxy provider. However, these crowdsourced gateway nodes have limited processing and Internet transfer capacity, potentially leading to overloading.

In this paper, we analyze a large crowdsourced proxy service in a regional community network. A large number of clients (C) can browse the web using the aggregated capacity of a pool of contributed web proxies (P), with C > P, spread over the network infrastructure, at a fraction of the cost of individual Internet connections.

We first describe the guifi.net network, its proxy service, and the collected datasets in Section 2. Then, we analyze the service from three viewpoints: (1) service usage by end-users, including usage patterns and content (Section 3), (2) the performance and variability of the proxies (Section 4), and (3) the local network, including topology and usage (Section 5). Our measurements provide insights into the effectiveness of a simple setup of a regional network sharing a set of web proxies in delivering free basic web access to a large population.

## 2. The guifi.net Proxy Service
Guifi.net is an open, free, and neutral network built by citizens and organizations pooling their resources to create and operate a local network infrastructure, governed as a common pool resource [2]. The network is primarily wireless [17] with a fiber backbone. Participants can extend the network to reach new locations and use it for intranet services like the web proxy service.

Web access is the most popular application in community networks, and guifi.net is no exception. Web proxy nodes, connected to both guifi.net and an ISP, act as free gateways to the Internet for the community network users. These proxies run on simple servers, leveraging the Internet access provided by individuals or organizations such as libraries or municipalities. Using web proxies, public entities can offer free Internet access without infringing on telecom market regulations. While some web proxies are kept private, 356 out of the 477 registered web proxy servers in the network (as of May 2016) are shared with all 12,500 registered participants. Users can select any proxy they prefer, though it is recommended to use one nearby. This flexibility allows some proxies to become popular and highly used, while others may remain underutilized.

**Data Collection:**
For our analysis, we focused on the Llucanes guifi.net zone, a region in the Osona county of Catalonia, Spain. This zone is representative of other rural guifi.net networks [6] and is the only zone with published anonymized logs for all four operational proxies. Even-day proxy log entries anonymize the client IP address and show information about requested URLs, while odd-day logs show the opposite. We assisted in preparing and publishing these logs. Combined with other openly accessible information about network topology, links, and traffic, these logs provide a consistent and complete view of the regional network.

## 3. Service Usage Viewpoint
The behavior of users and the service can be described at a macro level using time series metrics extracted from the monthly logs, such as bytes per request, number of requests, and number of users.

**Traffic Time Series:**
The aggregate traffic time series for the proxies shows a daily repetitive pattern with strong aperiodic negative spikes. Statistical verification indicates a dominant period of 1 day, with the second largest peak at 12 hours.

**Service Usage:**
Most of the traffic (90%) is generated by 15% of the users, with 20% of the requests producing 97% of the traffic. The distribution of traffic and number of requests per user varies exponentially. The request processing throughput, calculated as bits per time elapsed for each request, ranges from less than 10^7 for the worst 10% to at least 10^8 for more than 80% of the requests (Figure 1).

**Content Analysis:**
Using even-day proxy logs, we analyzed the request types and target URLs. Almost 50% of the traffic consists of HTTP CONNECT requests, primarily for establishing TCP tunnels over HTTP, mostly HTTPS. For other requests, the most common content type is application/* (23%), followed by video/* (19%) and image/* (5.5%).

Table 1 shows the top domains by traffic, with the top video portal occupying 36% of the traffic. This is not reflected in the number of requests, indicating that the high traffic is due to the size of the objects requested.

| **Domain** | **Traffic Fraction** |
|------------|---------------------|
| googlevideo | 27.85%              |
| mega       | 16.73%              |
| fbcdn      | 5.40%               |
| rncdn3     | 2.80%               |
| nflxvideo  | 2.70%               |
| xvideos    | 2.60%               |
| tv3        | 2.54%               |
| level3     | 2.51%               |
| google     | 1.96%               |
| apple      | 1.78%               |

## 4. The Proxy Viewpoint
In this section, we investigate the capabilities and influence of the proxy servers involved. Our dataset includes the four proxies operating in the Llucanes zone, which have diverse characteristics (Table 2).

| **Id**   | **CPU**                         | **RAM** | **Max Throughput** |
|----------|---------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| 3982     | Intel amd64 2-core 2.6 GHz      | 2 GB    | 80 Mbps            |
| 10473    | Intel x86 2-core 2.6 GHz        | 0.5 GB  | 6 Mbps             |
| 11252    | AMD Athlon(tm) XP 1700+         | 0.5 GB  | 4 Mbps             |
| 18202    | Intel amd64 2-core 2.7 GHz      | 2 GB    | 8 Mbps             |

**Table 2. Characteristics of the proxies**

**Cache Effectiveness:**
Passed-through content (HTTPS) represents the majority of the proxy traffic (49.4–64%). Although URLs repeat significantly (6.4–36% of proxy traffic), the content successfully served from the cache (after validation or not) only represents a negligible amount (1–1.6%). Despite URLs repeating often (20–41%), the content does not seem cache-friendly, as cache hits only represent a very small portion (3–10%). This indicates that cached content usually corresponds to small objects.

**Cache Size:**
The default allocated cache size in guifi.net proxy settings is 10 GB of secondary storage, but in some proxies, caching is not enabled. Cached content that results in cache hits accounts for a maximum of 151 MB (if all repeated URLs were cacheable) and an average of 61 MB (based on cache hits) of data per day. In the extreme case where all content is cacheable and discounting the transparent CONNECT/HTTPS data, the amount of daily data seen (i.e., all content for all URLs seen) accounts for a maximum of 1.5 GB or 801 MB on average, easily achievable with RAM-based caches.

**Sharing Across Clients:**
Proxies can provide the benefit of sharing network resources, reusing not only HTTP content but also DNS resolution data and established TCP connections. Figure 2 shows the popularity of URLs across different clients in each proxy over a month, with top values between 60 to 212 different clients accessing each given URL. The number is related to the structure of the service, with many decentralized proxies with few users each and no inter-cache cooperation, limiting the potential for sharing cached content across more users.

**Proxy Selection:**
Users are instructed to check the public list of nearby proxies in the public network management directory, which shows a list of nearby proxies, including status and availability ratio. They can also follow the advice of trusted neighbors with previous usage experience.
