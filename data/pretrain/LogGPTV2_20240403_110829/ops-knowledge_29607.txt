User: I wrote a program that uses the console.  Most of the time, the user must see the console informations.  For a specific function from command line, I would like to run the script without the console rises. I just don't want see the window but it can be in the task bar. I know I can use extra modules (gui, win32,..) to do that but I would like to use the standard python librairy.  
Is it possible to do that?
The program should run on Windows. (python 2.7)
I specify... I know I can use pythonw.exe too. The question then is how to launch the same script with python.exe sometimes and with pythonw.exe (from command line) for a specific function?
Assistant: My first idea would be to have a .pyw-script for that specific task, that is launched in this case. Then only the original script's console pops up for a short time.
