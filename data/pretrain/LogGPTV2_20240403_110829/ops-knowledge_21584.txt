To effectively implement CIS Control 6.5, which requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative access, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Identify Administrative Accounts**: Conduct a thorough inventory to identify all administrative accounts across the organization's IT environment, including those managed on-site and through third-party providers.

2. **Enable MFA**: Enable MFA for all identified administrative accounts. This includes both local and remote access, ensuring that MFA is supported and enforced on all enterprise assets.

3. **Implement Strong Authentication Mechanisms**: Use robust MFA solutions that provide a high level of security. This may include hardware tokens, biometric verification, or authenticator apps, in addition to traditional passwords.

4. **Regular Audits and Monitoring**: Regularly audit and monitor the use of MFA to ensure compliance and detect any anomalies or unauthorized access attempts. Implement logging and alerting mechanisms to promptly address any issues.

5. **Policy and Training**: Develop and enforce a clear policy requiring MFA for administrative access. Provide training and awareness programs for administrators and other relevant personnel to understand the importance of MFA and how to use it effectively.

6. **Third-Party Provider Coordination**: If administrative access is managed through third-party providers, coordinate with them to ensure MFA is enabled and properly configured. Verify that their MFA solutions meet the organizationâ€™s security standards.

By following these procedures, the organization can enhance its security posture and protect against unauthorized administrative access, aligning with the "Protect" function of CIS Control 6.5, which focuses on the asset type "Users."
