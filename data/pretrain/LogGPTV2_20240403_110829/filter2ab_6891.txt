**ATT&CK ID:** T1048.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol

Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transmitting it over an unencrypted network protocol that is distinct from the established command and control (C2) channel. This method can involve sending the data to an alternate network location, separate from the primary C2 server. By using a different, unsecured protocol, attackers can bypass security measures and potentially evade detection.
