### Soft Errors and Parity Detection
If a register does not contain valid information, it will not be read, and consequently, a parity error will not be reported. Mukherjee et al. [15] introduced the concept of the Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF), defined as the probability that an error will result in a system-visible failure. They demonstrated that only a small fraction of latches contain information relevant to architecturally-correct execution.

### Error Recovery in SPARC64 V
In the SPARC64 V, errors occurring in any of the 1'J140K latches are recoverable through instruction retry. The estimated percentage of logic errors that can be recovered is 67% (1'J140K/210K). Errors in these recoverable latches do not lead to system failures, effectively reducing their contribution to the AVF to zero and improving the overall system AVF.

### Verification of Error Detection Mechanisms
However, the effectiveness of these mechanisms had not been verified under real operating conditions due to the difficulty of collecting data from a statistically significant number of failure incidents. The objective of the neutron beam experiment was to determine the overall AVF of the SPARC64 microprocessor and validate the effectiveness of the error detection and recovery mechanisms.

### Accelerated Test Setup
We conducted accelerated soft error testing on Fujitsu's PRIMEPOWER 650 server using the white neutron beam facility at RCNP. The intensity of the neutron beam at this facility is approximately 2x10^8 times that of atmospheric neutrons at sea level, allowing us to induce many soft errors in a short period under controlled conditions.

**Figure 2** [11] shows the energy spectrum of the RCNP neutron beam compared with the atmospheric neutron flux (scaled by the flux density) and the LANSCE neutron beam. The RCNP beam spectrum closely matches the atmospheric spectrum up to 300 MeV but falls off above this energy due to the maximum energy limit.

The PRIMEPOWER 650 is an 8-CPU server with 4 CPU modules on each side of the server enclosure. In these accelerated tests, 4 CPU modules on the same side were placed in the path of the neutron beam. **Figures 3 and 4** show the test setup, and **Figure 5** shows the CPU module placement in the server.

### Beam Attenuation and Measurement
The original RCNP neutron beam has a flux density (above 10 MeV) of 2.8 x 10^9 neutrons/cm^2/s. However, the beam was attenuated by other devices-under-test (DUT) placed in front of the PRIMEPOWER 650 server enclosure and by the server enclosure and CPU modules themselves. We estimated the beam flux at each CPU chip by measuring the number of level-2 cache SRAM bit flips.

The CPU module consists of a steel bolster plate, a printed circuit board, a ceramic package, the CPU chip itself, a copper heat spreader, and an aluminum heat sink, with a total thickness of about 10 mm, as shown in **Figure 6**.

**Figure 7** shows a semi-log plot of the module position dependency of the normalized level-2 cache SRAM bit errors. The frequency of errors was reduced by 23.4% as the beam passed through each module. Correcting for beam divergence, the beam attenuation by each module was calculated to be 22%.

According to the JEDEC standard JESD89-3 [14], the total attenuation from a single CPU module should be 4% or less. We believe that scattering is the primary contributor to this discrepancy. Since the CPU chip is a small target, most scattered neutrons from the 10 cm-diameter beam will not strike the downstream CPU chip, leading to much larger attenuation due to scattering than absorption. [16] provides the neutron scattering and absorption cross sections, showing that the scattering cross section is generally larger than the absorption cross section for Cu and Fe, especially for >10 MeV energy neutrons.

We also measured neutron beam intensity with plastic film detectors sensitive to neutrons up to 20 MeV, placed at both ends of the server enclosure. These measurements indicated that the attenuation from the CPU modules was about 30%, suggesting that lower energy neutrons were attenuated more than higher energy neutrons. This larger total attenuation is expected given the energy loss as the beam passes through the CPU modules and the high-energy fall-off of the RCNP beam.

### Soft Error Measurement
#### Static Test
The contents of the 4 MB level-2 cache were initialized and then exposed to the neutron beam for 5 minutes. The cache contents were read back and compared with the initialized values to check for neutron-induced bit flips. Many repetitions of these 5-minute accelerated tests were run.

**Figure 8** shows that the dominant fails observed were single-bit failures, with double-bit fails from a single neutron hit being 30 times less frequent. The average number of error bits per neutron hit was 1.05 bits.

**Figure 9** shows the observed fail bit maps for 5 and 6 bit fails. While multiple bits were flipped by a single neutron hit, the error bit locations spanned 8 bits or less in the word line direction. With the use of the 8:1 column multiplex, these multi-bit errors are distributed as single-bit errors in multiple words, preventing them from being observed as multi-bit errors at the SRAM output.

Although some double-bit errors were detected in SRAM static tests, the physical locations of error bits were far apart, suggesting they were caused by multiple neutron hits. There was concern that high-energy (>300 MeV) atmospheric neutron collisions could generate a large number of error bits (>9) and result in a double-bit error in a single word. However, extrapolating the data in **Figure 8** showed that the occurrence of 9 or more bit errors from a single hit should be over 4 orders of magnitude less frequent than single-bit errors. The contribution of a double-bit error due to a single atmospheric neutron hit is estimated to be less than 1 FIT.

Latch bit flips were measured by initializing latches through a scan chain. The length of the beam exposure was much longer than in the SRAM experiment, as the number of latch bits (approximately 240K) is much smaller than the number of level-2 cache SRAM bits (32M). From these measurements, latches demonstrated 1.3 times greater sensitivity to neutron hits than level-2 cache SRAM cells.

#### Dynamic Test
The occurrence of soft errors was recorded while running six different programs: SVOP, LINPACK, gcc, bzip2, galgel, and sixtrack. SVOP is an in-house program.
