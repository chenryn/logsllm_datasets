probability that an error will result in a system-visible
failure. Furthermore,
they showed that only a small
fraction of latches contain information relevant
to
architecturally-correct execution.
In the SPARC64 V, errors that occur in any of
I'J140K latches are recoverable with instruction retry, so
the estimated percentage of logic errors that will be
recovered is 67% (1'J140K/210K). Errors in recoverable
latches do not lead to system failures. The contribution
of these latches to the AVF is effectively zero and the
system AVF is improved accordingly.
But, the effectiveness of these mechanisms had not
been verified under real operating conditions due to the
difficulty of collecting data
from a statistically
significant number of failure incidents. The objective of
this neutron beam experiment was to determine the
overall AVF of the SPARC64 microprocessor and
validate the effectiveness of the error detection and
recovery mechanisms.
3. Accelerated test set-up
We carried out accelerated soft error testing of the
Fujitsu's PRIMEPOWER 650 server using the white
neutron beam facility at RCNP. The intensity of the
neutron beam of this facility is about 2x108 that of
atmospheric neutrons at sea level. We can incur many
soft errors in a short period of time under controlled
circumstances.
Figure 2 [11] shows the energy spectrum of the
RCNP neutron beam compared with the atmospheric
neutron flux (scaled by the flux density) and the
LANSCE neutron beam. The RCNP beam spectrum
closely matches
the atmospheric spectrum up to
300MeV. Due to the maximum energy limit, the RCNP
beam spectrum falls off above 300MeV.
The PRIMEPOWER 650 is an 8-CPU server with
4 CPU modules on each side of the server enclosure. In

these accelerated tests, 4 CPU modules on the same side
of the enclosure were placed in the path of the neutron
beam. Figures 3 and 4 show the test setup. Figure 5
shows the CPU module placement in the server.
The flux density (above IOMeV) of the original
RCNP neutron beam is 2.8 x 109 neutron/cm2/s.
However, because we ran our experiments with other
semiconductor soft error measurements, the beam was
attenuate by devices-under-test (DUT) placed in front of
the PRIMEPOWER 650 server enclosure.
The beam was also attenuated by the server
enclosure and CPU modules themselves as it passed
through each module. We chose to estimate the beam
flux at each CPU chip by measuring the number of
level-2 cache SRAM bit flips.
The CPU module is composed of a steel bolster
plate, a printed circuit board, a ceramic package, the
CPU chip itself, a copper heat spreader and an
aluminum heat sink. The total thickness is about 10mm
as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 7 shows a semi-log plot of the module
position dependency of the normalized level-2 cache
SRAM bit errors. The frequency of errors was reduced
by 23.4% as the beam passed through each module. The
beam
expected
divergence was 1.8%. Correcting for beam divergence,
beam attenuation by each module was calculated to be
22%.

JEDEC standard JESD89-3 [14] gives the following
equation for attenuation of neutrons:
Total Attenuation = 1t i=1I""A {I - exp[-lj(em) x Pi(g/cm3]lI216 (glan2)]}
According to this equation,
the total attenuation
from a single CPU module should be 4% or less.
We believe scattering is the primary contributor to
this discrepancy. Since the CPU chip is a small target,
the majority of the scattered neutrons
from the
10cm-diameter beam will not strike the downstream
CPU chip and the attenuation due to scattering can be
much larger than the absorption. [16] gives the neutron
scattering and the absorption cross sections. Although
the absorPtion data is for low-energy thermal neutrons,
it shows the scattering cross section is larger than the
absorption cross section for Cu and Fe. For>10MeV
energy neutrons,

We also measured neutron beam intensity with
plastic film detectors sensitive to neutrons up to 20MeV.
These were placed at both ends of the server enclosure.
The measurements indicated that the attenuation from
the CPU modules was about 30%. This indicated that
the lower energy neutrons were attenuated much more
than the higher energy neutrons. Because the RCNP
beam falls off at higher energies, and the beam loses
energy as it passes through the CPU modules, a larger

Both of these mechanisms are believed to contribute
to the larger attenuation observed relative to the JEDEC
calculated value, but the reasons for this discrepancy are
not fully understood.
The data points shown in the semi-log plot in Figure
7 fall along the same line. This result indicates that the
variation in the soft error rate among those CPU chips
was small. The ratio of SRAM errors measured was
used to estimate the flux density at each module
position.
4. Soft error measurement
4.1. Static test
The contents of the 4MB level-2 cache were
initialized,
then exposed to the neutron beam for 5
minutes. The cache contents were read back and
compared with the initialized values to check for
neutron-induced bit flips. Many repetitions of these 5
minute accelerated test were run.
As shown in Figure 8, the dominant fails observed
were single-bit failures. Double-bit fails from a single
neutron hit were 30 times less frequent than single-bit
fails. The average number of error bits per neutron hit
was 1.05bit.

Figure 8. Normalized frequency of
failed bits per neutron hit
Figure 9 shows the observed fail bit maps for 5 and
6 bit fails. While multiple bits were flipped by a single
neutron hit, the error bit locations spanned 8 bits or less
in the word line direction (horizontal in Figure 9). With
the use of the 8: 1 column multiplex, these multi-bit
errors are distributed as single-bit errors in multiple
words. These errors will not be observed as multi-bit
errors at the SRAM output.
Although a number of double-bit errors occurring in
a single word were detected in SRAM static tests, the
physical
locations of error bits were far apart and
appeared to be caused by multiple neutron hits.
There was
some concern that a high-energy
(>300MeV) atmospheric neutron collision, which does
not occur in these accelerated tests, could generate a
large number of error bits (>9) and result in a double-bit
error in a single word. Extrapolating the data in Figure 8,
however, showed that the occurrence of 9 or more bit
errors from a single hit should be over 4 orders of
magnitude
errors.
Furthermore, the flipped bits must be aligned with the
word line direction to cause an ECC error. From the data,
the contribution of a double-bit error due to a single
atmospheric neutron hit is estimated to be less than 1

Latch bit flips were measured by initializing latches
through a scan chain. The length of the beam exposure
was much longer than in the SRAM experiment, as the
number of latch bits (--240K) is much smaller than the
number of level-2 cache SRAM bits (32M). From these
measurements, latches demonstrated 1.3 times greater
sensitivity to neutron hits than level-2 cache SRAM
cells.
Because the neutron beam was attenuated as it
passed through the CPU modules (Figure 7),
the
acceleration factors for each CPU chip were adjusted
before calculating failure in time (FIT) figures. These
static measurements provide a basis to estimate the
number of bit flips for the dynamic measurements
described below.
