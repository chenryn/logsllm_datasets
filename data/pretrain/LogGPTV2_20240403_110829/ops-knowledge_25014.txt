**User:**

I have a somewhat unique request. I am looking to listen on a specific port for all traffic coming through via the IRC protocol. My goal is to log all messages, commands, etc., without joining any channels. I simply want to passively listen and log the traffic.

Is there an easy, built-in way to achieve this? I have been exploring the `irc.IRC` and `irc.IRCClient` classes in Twisted, but they seem too high-level for my needs. Is the only solution to descend to the base `Server` class, or can I still leverage some of the higher-level functionality provided by Twisted?

**Assistant:**

I understand your requirement. However, if you are just connecting to an IRC server as a client, the server will not send you messages for channels that you haven't joined. This is a standard behavior in the IRC protocol to ensure privacy and security.

If you are the host of the IRC server, you would have more control over the traffic and could potentially implement a custom logging mechanism. Otherwise, you may need to explore lower-level solutions, such as creating a custom server or using a network sniffer like Wireshark to capture and log the traffic.

In summary, if you are not the server host, the typical IRC client libraries, including those in Twisted, will not allow you to passively log traffic from unjoined channels. You might need to consider other approaches, such as running your own IRC server with custom logging capabilities.
