#### Impact of Chrome Patch
Chrome released a patch for WRB (WebSocket Request Blocking) in version 58 on April 19, 2017. To understand the impact of this patch, we compared the statistics from our crawls before and after this date. 

- There was a significant drop in the number of unique A&A domains initiating WebSockets over time.
- The fraction of A&A-initiated sockets remained relatively constant.
- 57 A&A initiators, including Google, Facebook, and AddThis, disappeared between our first and last crawl. The reasons for this abandonment are unclear.

For A&A socket receivers, there has been no significant change over time. Many of these receivers provide services that depend on WebSockets, such as real-time commenting and chat, which explains why they have not altered their software.

#### Services Provided by Receivers
The A&A receivers in Table III are less well-known companies that offer a variety of services:

- **Disqus**: Provides user comment boards and is also an ad network.
- **33across and Lockerdome**: Advertising platforms.
- **Inspectlet, Hotjar, and SimpleHeatmaps**: Session replay services that track user interactions to generate analytical heatmaps.
- **Zopim, Velaro, Smartsupp, and Intercom**: Provide customer service live-chat widgets.

These services highlight the dual use of WebSockets for serving advertisements and tracking users.

#### Data Sent and Received
The following table shows the items being sent and received by A&A domains via WebSockets and HTTP/S.
