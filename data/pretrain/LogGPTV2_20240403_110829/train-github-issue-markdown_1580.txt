**TypeScript Version:**
I use typescript compiler 1.8.10 from npm.
**Code**  
I use TypeScript in a project with ~500 ts files. When I type in console tsc
-w and wait for the whole project is compiled, I add a small changes to one of
my files. It re-compiles whole project instead of one changed file (it takes
10-25 seconds). I used node-inspector to track what the reason of such
behavior. I found out that when it performs re-compilation (tsc.ts:564), it
creates a new program without passing an old program as a forth parameter to
the function.
I created a small project for experiments with some files and start watcher
with flag --listFiles:
    tsc -w --listFiles 
My tsconfig.json:
    {
      "exclude": [],
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "isolatedModules": true,
        "declaration": false,
        "inlineSourceMap": false,
        "noImplicitAny": false,
        "removeComments": true,
        "noLib": false,
        "allowJs": false
      }
    }
**Expected behavior:**
It should compile only one changed file (I added a space to the calc.ts
files).
**Actual behavior:**
It re-compiles whole files:

I understand that such behavior can't be added for project that should be
bundled into one file.
Thanks
