### Example Configuration and Troubleshooting for IBM MQ High Availability (HA) Queue Managers

#### Overview
This document provides an example of the expected configuration and status when everything is working as intended, along with troubleshooting steps for common issues. The commands are run on VM13.

#### Expected Configuration and Status

1. **Queue Manager HAQM1:**
   ```plaintext
   %rdqmstatus -m HAQM1
   Node: mqhavm13.gamsworthwilliam.com
   Queue manager status: Running
   CPU: 0.00%
   Memory: 123MB
   Queue manager file system: 606MB used, 1.0GB allocated [60%]
   HA role: Primary
   HA status: Normal
   HA control: Enabled
   HA current location: This node
   HA preferred location: This node
   HA blocked location: None
   HA floating IP interface: eth4
   HA floating IP address: 192.0.2.4
   ```

2. **Queue Manager HAQM2:**
   ```plaintext
   %rdqmstatus -m HAQM2
   Node: mqhavm13.gamsworthwilliam.com
   Queue manager status: Running elsewhere
   HA role: Secondary
   HA status: Normal
   HA control: Enabled
   HA current location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA preferred location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA blocked location: None
   HA floating IP interface: eth4
   HA floating IP address: 192.0.2.6
   ```

3. **Queue Manager HAQM3:**
   ```plaintext
   %rdqmstatus -m HAQM3
   Node: mqhavm13.gamsworthwilliam.com
   Queue manager status: Running elsewhere
   HA role: Secondary
   HA status: Normal
   HA control: Enabled
   HA current location: mqhavm15.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA preferred location: mqhavm15.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA blocked location: None
   HA floating IP interface: eth4
   HA floating IP address: 192.0.2.8
   ```

**Key Points:**
- All three nodes show an HA status of "Normal."
- Each HA queue manager is running on the node where it was created. For example, HAQM1 is running on VM13, HAQM2 on VM14, and HAQM3 on VM15.

#### Troubleshooting Scenario

**Scenario:**
- HAQM1 is configured to run on VM13.
- An attempt is made to move HAQM1 to VM14, but it fails due to an invalid value in the `/var/mqm/mqs.ini` file on VM14.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Change the preferred location for HAQM1 to VM14:
   ```bash
   rdqmadm -m HAQM1 -n mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com -p
   ```

2. Check the status on VM13:
   ```plaintext
   $ rdqmstatus -m HAQM1
   Node: mqhavm13.gamsworthwilliam.com
   Queue manager status: Running
   CPU: 0.15%
   Memory: 133MB
   Queue manager file system: 52MB used, 1.0GB allocated [5%]
   HA role: Primary
   HA status: Normal
   HA control: Enabled
   HA current location: This node
   HA preferred location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA blocked location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA floating IP interface: None
   HA floating IP address: None
   Node: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA status: Normal
   Node: mqhavm15.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA status: Normal
   ```

3. Examine the failed resource actions:
   ```plaintext
   $ rdqmstatus -m HAQM1 -a
   Node: mqhavm13.gamsworthwilliam.com
   Queue manager status: Running
   CPU: 0.15%
   Memory: 133MB
   Queue manager file system: 52MB used, 1.0GB allocated [5%]
   HA role: Primary
   HA status: Normal
   HA control: Enabled
   HA current location: This node
   HA preferred location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA blocked location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA floating IP interface: None
   HA floating IP address: None
   Node: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA status: Normal
   Node: mqhavm15.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA status: Normal
   Failed resource action: Start
   Resource type: Queue manager
   Failure node: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   Failure time: 2022-01-01 12:00:00
   Failure reason: Generic error
   Blocked location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   ```

**Correcting the Failure:**
1. Correct the underlying problem by restoring the correct directory value for HAQM1 in `/var/mqm/mqs.ini` on VM14.
2. Clear the failed action using the `rdqmclean` command:
   ```bash
   $ rdqmclean -m HAQM1
   ```

3. Verify the status again:
   ```plaintext
   $ rdqmstatus -m HAQM1
   Node: mqhavm13.gamsworthwilliam.com
   Queue manager status: Running elsewhere
   HA role: Secondary
   HA status: Normal
   HA control: Enabled
   HA current location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA preferred location: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA blocked location: None
   HA floating IP interface: None
   HA floating IP address: None
   Node: mqhavm14.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA status: Normal
   Node: mqhavm15.gamsworthwilliam.com
   HA status: Normal
   ```

#### Problems After Upgrading RDQM

If you encounter issues after upgrading one or more nodes in your RDQM configuration, ensure that the installed DRBD kernel module matches the OS kernel version. Mismatches can cause various problems, such as queue managers not starting or not running on the upgraded node.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Node: mqhavm57.exampleco.com
OS kernel version: 3.10.0-1160.15.2
DRBD OS kernel version: 3.10.0-957
DRBD version: 9.1.2+ptf.3
DRBD kernel module status: Partially loaded
Queue manager name: QM1
Queue manager status: Running elsewhere
HA status: Unknown
HA current location: mqhavm58.exampleco.com
HA preferred location: This node
HA blocked location: None
DR role: Primary
DR status: Unknown
Queue manager name: QM2
Queue manager status: Running elsewhere
HA status: Unknown
HA current location: mqhavm58.exampleco.com
HA preferred location: This node
HA blocked location: None
Queue manager name: QM3
Queue manager status: Status not available
DR role: Secondary
DR status: Unknown
```
**Resolution:**
- Update the DRBD kernel module to match the running OS kernel version.

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Node: mqhavm07.exampleco.com
OS kernel version: 3.10.0-1160.15.2
DRBD OS kernel version: 3.10.0-1127
DRBD version: 9.1.1
DRBD kernel module status: Loaded
Queue manager name: RDQM7
Queue manager status: Running
HA current location: This node
HA preferred location: This node
HA blocked location: None
```
**Resolution:**
- Install the correct DRBD module for your RHEL installation to ensure correct operation.

#### Troubleshooting Security Problems

**Related Tasks:**
- **Collecting Information for Security Problems:**
  - If IBM MQ is incorrectly allowing or denying access to a user or application, collect troubleshooting information.
- **Collecting Information for TLS Channel Problems:**
  - If an IBM MQ queue manager or client application is failing to establish a secure channel using TLS, collect troubleshooting information.

**Troubleshooting Channel Authentication Record Problems:**
- Ensure the correct address is presented to the queue manager based on the network adapter.
- Use `SET CHLAUTH TYPE(BLOCKADDR)` with the generic channel name `CHLAUTH(*)` to block access from specified addresses.
- On z/OS, enclose the asterisk in quotation marks: `CHLAUTH('*')`.

**Behavior of SET CHLAUTH Command Over Queue Manager Restart:**
- If the `SYSTEM.CHLAUTH.DATA.QUEUE` is deleted or altered, the `SET CHLAUTH` command will only update the in-memory cache and fail to harden.
- Reissue the command with `ACTION(REPLACE)` before cycling the queue manager.

**Maximum Size of ADDRESS and ADDRLIST on z/OS Systems:**
- On z/OS, the maximum size for the `ADDRESS` and `ADDRLIST` fields is 48 characters.
- Use patterns within this limit or express requirements differently.

**CipherSpec Mismatches:**
- Both ends of an IBM MQ TLS channel must use the same CipherSpec.
- Mismatches can be detected during the TLS handshake or channel startup.
- Ensure both ends of the channel define the same CipherSpec.

**Authentication Failures During TLS Handshake:**
- Common reasons include revoked certificates, expired or corrupted certificates, and missing CA root certificates.
- Validate certificates against revocation lists and ensure the certificate chain is complete.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve common issues in your IBM MQ high availability and security configurations.
