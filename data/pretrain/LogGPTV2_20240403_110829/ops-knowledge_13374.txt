User: The network can be pinged, but the service cannot communicate normally. What is the reason?
Assistant: Possible causes of failure: 1. Service port, check whether the service port is disabled or occupied. 2. Firewall policy interception, check whether the firewall policy and service port communication policy are enabled. 3. Service configuration issue, check the configuration file or settings of the service and make sure it is configured correctly.
