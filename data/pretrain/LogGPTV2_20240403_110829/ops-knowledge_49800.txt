User: Your application needs to support users worldwide with low latency. Please provide a possible CDN (Content Delivery Network) architecture.
Assistant: viable CDN architecture can include the following components: 1. Edge servers: These servers are located in different geographical locations around the world and are connected to users through the Internet. Each edge server stores the most frequently requested content by users, such as static assets, multimedia files, and so on. 2. Distributed Load Balancer: This component helps to distribute user requests to the nearest edge server, thereby reducing latency. This component should be able to support global load balancing. 3. Caching: To further improve performance, CDNs should use caching to cache content requested by users. Caching can provide faster responses with less network bandwidth. 4. DNS resolver: When a user enters a URL in the browser, the DNS resolver will resolve it into an IP address and send the request to the nearest edge server. The entire CDN architecture should be composed of multiple components to ensure low latency and high reliability. For example, distributed load balancers and edge servers can create clusters of workers to spread risk in the event of a failure. By adding caching and DNS resolvers to the architecture, you can ensure that user requests are responded to faster.
