Subject: Feature Request: Multi-Cursor Support via Alt + Click and Drag

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about a feature in Sublime Text that I believe would greatly enhance the coding experience in Atom as well.

In Sublime Text, holding down the "Alt" key while clicking and dragging the cursor creates multiple instances of the cursor wherever the mouse touches. This functionality is incredibly useful for making simultaneous edits across different parts of a file, significantly improving coding speed and flexibility. If you haven't tried it before, I highly recommend giving it a go, as it can be a bit challenging to describe fully in words.

I was wondering if there are any plans to implement a similar feature in Atom. The addition of this multi-cursor support would be a game-changer, providing users with an even more efficient and flexible coding environment.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
