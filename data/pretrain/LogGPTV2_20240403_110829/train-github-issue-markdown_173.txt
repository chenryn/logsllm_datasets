Hi there,
In Sublime Text, when you hold the "alt" key and click and drag the cursor, it
will automatically create an instance of the cursor in the place where the
cursor is touching (I suggest giving it a try, it is kind of complicated to
explain).
Atom should have this, since it would be a big game changer for what it
delivers in terms of speed coding flexibility :)
Is this planned for the near future?
Thanks in advance!
