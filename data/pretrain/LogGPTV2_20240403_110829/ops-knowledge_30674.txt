User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows 2019 Server Invalid Password, but RDP connection allowed I run a small physical network (1 domain controller, 2 servers) on a bare-metal hosting platform.  All servers are Windows Server 2019 with Remote Desktop licensing enabled etc.
I find today that I am unable to login to the domain controller.   The RDP connection is allowed (and would tell me if my password was wrong), but when I connect to the server I see the lock screen and the title &quot;Other User&quot; with the message &quot;The user name or password is incorrect.  Try again.&quot;
I can get to the same screen using KVM, but we haven't changed the passwords for several months.  Is there a known issue about this?   I normally log on using the Administrator account, so I can't go in via another route, and I need to add more users.
Can I simply restart the server and hope that this might clear it?   I have a team in India logging on to the other servers in the network on a daily basis, so I don't want to lose all Domain Controller services!
Thanks for any help that you can provide.

Assistant: This might be an issue with your domain, what if you disjointed your machine from the domain and rejoin again and see if you can join normally.
