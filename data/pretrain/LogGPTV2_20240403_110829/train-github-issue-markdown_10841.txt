Just noting that there was a PR #14264 a year ago to try and add a `strftime`
method to datetime64 object. Wonder if it might be resurrected???
:issue:#14243
To make it a little more friendly for packages downstream like Pandas it helps
to compare synonomously with Python datetime and something like:
    import datetime as dt
    import numpy as np
    date = dt.datetime.strptime('2020-06-30', format='%Y-%m-%d')
    date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    dt.datetime.strftime(date, "%Y-%m-%d")
    date64 = np.datetime64('2012-06-30T20:00')
    np.datetime_as_string(date64, unit='D')
    # nice with a direct date64.strftime(format) method..
