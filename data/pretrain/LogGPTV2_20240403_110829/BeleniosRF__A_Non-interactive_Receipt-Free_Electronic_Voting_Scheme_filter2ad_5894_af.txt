cost is verifying our Groth-Sahai proofs, which is dominated
by ca. 64(k + 1) pairings, reducible to 4(k + 35) using tech-
niques from [11] and [31]. Given the timings provided by
Beuchat et al. [10], we expect a throughput of roughly 5
ballots/second/core for k = 10. Additionally, checks can be
amortized throughout the voting period, as ballots come in.
6. THE BLAZY ET AL. VOTING PROTO-
COL IS NOT BALLOT-PRIVATE
Blazy et al. [12], who introduced the notion of signatures
on randomizable ciphertexts, proposed to use this primitive
for a receipt-free e-voting protocol. Their ballot-creation and
-casting protocol workﬂow is as follows:
• The voter sends ballot
b =(cid:0)vk, c = {v}r
where r, s, t ∈ Zp denote the randomness used for encrypting
the vote v, signing the resulting ciphertext c and creating
the NIZK proof π, respectively.
• The server re-randomizes the ballot b to b(cid:48) as follows:
(cid:1), where r(cid:48), s(cid:48), t(cid:48) ←$ Zp.
(cid:0)vk, c = {v}r(cid:48)
, πt(cid:48),v ∈ {0,1}
pk, σvk,s(cid:48)
c
pk
Similarly to BeleniosRF, the server can only re-randomize
legitimate signatures, meaning that any new ballot b(cid:48) that
contains a valid signature w.r.t. vk must originate from a
ballot b that has been previously created by the voter, and
thus b and b(cid:48) contain the same vote.
An attack on ballot privacy. However, the above ballot
casting workﬂow is not ballot private, let alone receipt-free.
The following is a ballot replay attack, which is known to
break ballot privacy [23]:
• Honest voter sends b =(cid:0)vk, c = {v}r

(cid:1).

Moreover, our deﬁnition builds on the recent work [9], in-
heriting a simple, concise, and game-based deﬁnition. Such
deﬁnitions are well-known for easing the job of conceiving
and writing security proofs; a point we conﬁrm by giving a
new e-voting protocol that satisﬁes our deﬁnition in bilinear
groups under the SXDH assumption in pairing groups, in
the random oracle model. The protocol is built using ideas
from a previous work [12] that claimed to have solved this
problem. We show however that the previous voting scheme
was not ballot-private, which is weaker than receipt-freeness.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst scheme that
is both receipt-free (in a strong sense) and has universal
veriﬁability (in the sense of strong veriﬁability [22]), without
requiring the existence of an untappable channel, or the use
of secure hardware tokens. We only require that the receipt-
freeness adversary is not eavesdropping the communication
between the voter and the voting server, and the existence
of a re-randomization service. As a result, we overcome the
impossibility result [19], stating no scheme can be receipt-free
and universally veriﬁable without an untappable channel. We
achieve this by relying on a ballot box server that is entrusted
to re-randomize ballots without changing its contents, in a
publicly veriﬁable way [12]. Finally, we showed the feasibility
of our approach by implementing a voting client in Javascript
and measuring its performance in a number of platforms.

These instructions allow any voter with knowledge of a
ballot b to produce an independent-looking ballot ¯b, that
will be accepted by the voting server and eﬀectively contains
a copy of the vote in b. Thus, the voting protocol [12] is
not ballot-private. (Note that due to re-randomizing being
allowed, the ballot box cannot discard copied votes, as they
look like legitimate ones.)
7. CONCLUSIONS
We introduced the notion of strong receipt-freeness, where
a malicious voter (i.e. vote-selling or coerced) cannot produce
a receipt proving how she voted, whether the voter decided
to act maliciously before, during or after casting the ballot.
Our adversarial model is close to the spirit of the sem-
inal work on receipt-freeness by Benaloh and Tuinstra [8].
