Description 
allocator 
VirtualAllocEx The preferred method to allocate memory in the remote process. 
Specify VirtualAllocEx or NtMapViewOfSection. The 
NtMapViewOfSection option is for same-architecture injection 
only. VirtualAllocEx is always used for cross-arch memory 
allocations. 
min_alloc 
4096 
Minimum amount of memory to request for injected content 
startrwx 
false 
Use RWX as initial permissions for injected content. Alternative 
is RW. 
userwx 
false 
Use RWX as final permissions for injected content.  
Alternative is RX. 
The transform-x86 and transform-x64 blocks pad content injected by Beacon. These blocks 
support two commands: prepend and append. The prepend command inserts a string before the 
injected content. The append command adds a string after the injected content. Make sure that 
prepended data is valid code for the injected content’s architecture (x86, x64). The c2lint 
program does not have a check for this.  
The execute block controls the methods Beacon will use when it needs to inject code into a 
process. Beacon examines each option in the execute block, determines if the option is usable for 
the current context, tries the method when it is usable, and moves on to the next option if code 
execution did not happen. The execute options include: 
Option 
x86 -> x64 
x64 -> x86 
Notes 
CreateThread 
Current process only 
CreateRemoteThread 
Yes 
No cross-session 
NtQueueApcThread 
NtQueueApcThread-s 
This is the “Early Bird” injection 
technique. Suspended processes (e.g., 
post-ex jobs) only. 
RtlCreateUserThread 
Yes 
Yes 
Risky on XP-era targets; uses RWX 
shellcode for x86 -> x64 injection. 
SetThreadContext 
Yes 
Suspended processes (e.g., post-ex jobs) 
only. 
The CreateThread and CreateRemoteThread options have variants that spawn a suspended 
thread with the address of another function, update the suspended thread to execute the injected 
code, and resume that thread. Use [function] “module!function+0x##” to specify the start address 
to spoof. For remote processes, ntdll and kernel32 are the only recommended modules to pull

/
85/
from. The optional 0x## part is an offset added to the start address. These variants work x86 -> 
x86 and x64 -> x64 only. 
The execute options you choose must cover a variety of corner cases. These corner cases include 
self injection, injection into suspended temporary processes, cross-session remote process 
injection, x86 -> x64 injection, x64 -> x86 injection, and injection with or without passing an 
argument. The c2lint tool will warn you about contexts that your execute block does not cover. 
12.4 Post Exploitation Jobs 
Larger Cobalt Strike post-exploitation features (e.g., screenshot, keylogger, hashdump, etc.) are 
implemented as Windows DLLs. To execute these features, Cobalt Strike spawns a temporary 
process, and injects the feature into it. The process-inject block controls the process injection 
step. The post-ex block controls the content and behaviors specific to Cobalt Strike’s post-
exploitation features. 
post-ex { 
# control the temporary process we spawn to 
set spawnto_x86 "%windir%\\syswow64\\rundll32.exe"; 
set spawnto_x64 "%windir%\\sysnative\\rundll32.exe"; 
# change the permissions and content of our post-ex DLLs 
set obfuscate "true"; 
# change our post-ex output named pipe names... 
set pipename "evil_####, stuff\\not_##_ev#l"; 
# pass key function pointers from Beacon to its child jobs 
set smartinject "true"; 
# disable AMSI in powerpick, execute-assembly, and psinject 
set amsi_disable "true"; 
} 
The spawnto_x86 and spawnto_x64 options control the default temporary process Beacon will 
spawn for its post-exploitation features. Here are a few tips for these values: 
1. Always specify the full path to the program you want Beacon to spawn  
2. Environment variables (e.g., %windir%) are OK within these paths. 
3. Do not specify %windir%\system32 or c:\windows\system32 directly. Always use 
syswow64 (x86) and sysnative (x64). Beacon will adjust these values to system32 where 
it’s necessary. 
4. For an x86 spawnto value, you must specify an x86 program. For an x64 spawnto 
value, you must specify an x64 program.

5. The paths you specify (minus the automatic syswow64/sysnative adjustment) must 
exist from both an x64 (native) and x86 (wow64) view of the file system. 
The obfuscate option scrambles the content of the post-ex DLLs and settles the post-ex 
capability into memory in a more OPSEC-safe way. It’s very similar to the obfuscate and userwx 
options available for Beacon via the stage block. Some long-running post-ex DLLs will mask 
and unmask their string table, as needed, when this option is set. 
Use pipename to change the named pipe names used, by post-ex DLLs, to send output back to 
Beacon. This option accepts a comma-separated list of pipenames. Cobalt Strike will select a 
random pipe name from this option when it sets up a post-exploitation job. Each # in the 
pipename is replaced with a valid hex character as well. 
The smartinject option directs Beacon to embed key function pointers, like GetProcAddress and 
LoadLibrary, into its same-architecture post-ex DLLs. This allows post-ex DLLs to bootstrap 
themselves in a new process without shellcode-like behavior that is detected and mitigated by 
watching memory accesses to the PEB and kernel32.dll. 
The thread_hint option allows multi-threaded post-ex DLLs to spawn threads with a spoofed 
start address. Specify the thread hint as “module!function+0x##” to specify the start address to 
spoof. The optional 0x## part is an offset added to the start address. 
The amsi_disable option directs powerpick, execute-assembly, and psinject to patch the 
AmsiScanBuffer function before loading .NET or PowerShell code. This limits the Antimalware 
Scan Interface visibility into these capabilities. 
Set the keylogger option to configure Cobalt Strike's keystroke logger. The GetAsyncKeyState 
option (default) uses the GetAsyncKeyState API to observe keystrokes. The 
SetWindowsHookEx option uses SetWindowsHookEx to observe keystrokes.

13. Reporting and Logging 
13.1 Logging 
Cobalt Strike logs all of its activity on the team server. These logs are located in the logs/ folder 
in the same directory you started your team server from. All Beacon activity is logged here with 
a date and timestamp.  
13.2 Reports 
Cobalt Strike has several report options to help make sense of your data and convey a story to 
your clients. You may configure the title, description, and hosts displayed in most reports.

Sessions Report 
This report documents indicators and activity on a session-by-session basis. This report includes: 
the communication path each session used to reach you, MD5 hashes of files put on disk during 
that session, miscellaneous indicators (e.g., service names), and a timeline of post-exploitation 
activity. This report is a fantastic tool to help a network defense team understand all of red’s 
activity and match their sensors to your activity.

13.3 Custom Logo in Reports 
Cobalt Strike reports display a Cobalt Strike logo at the top of the first page. You may replace 
this with an image of your choosing. Go to Cobalt Strike -> Preferences -> Reporting to set 
this 
Your custom image should be 1192x257px set to 300dpi. The 300dpi setting is necessary for the 
reporting engine to render your image at the right size. 
You may also set an accent color. This accent color is the color of the thick line below your 
image on the first page of the report. Links inside reports use the accent color too.
