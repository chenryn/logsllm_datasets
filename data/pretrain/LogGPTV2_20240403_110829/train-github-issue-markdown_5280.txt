# Description of the new feature/enhancement
    As a user with multiple tabs opened in Windows Terminal
    When I click and drag one tab to an area clear of Windows Terminal
    I want the tab to open in a new instance of Windows Terminal
    So that I can see both terminals side by side
Currently, in web browsers, we have the ability to grab a tab from a browser
window which has multiple tabs opened, and drag it which then puts the tab
that has been 'lifted' into its own browser window - this functionality
doesn't appear to be currently available in Windows Terminal.
Similarly - if I have spilt tabs into 2 windows, being able to re-merge them
would also be good :)
