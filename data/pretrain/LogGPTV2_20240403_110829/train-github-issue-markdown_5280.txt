### Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

**User Story:**
As a user with multiple tabs open in Windows Terminal, I want to be able to click and drag a tab to an area outside the current instance of Windows Terminal. This action should open the tab in a new instance of Windows Terminal, allowing me to view both terminals side by side.

**Current Behavior:**
Currently, Windows Terminal does not support the ability to drag a tab out of the current window to create a new instance. This functionality is available in web browsers, where you can drag a tab from a window with multiple tabs and drop it to create a new browser window. 

**Proposed Enhancement:**
1. **Tab Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**
   - Enable users to drag a tab from the current instance of Windows Terminal and drop it in an empty area on the desktop.
   - Upon dropping, the tab should open in a new instance of Windows Terminal, allowing the user to see both terminals side by side.

2. **Re-Merging Windows:**
   - Additionally, if a user has split tabs into two separate windows, they should be able to re-merge them back into a single window.
   - This can be achieved by dragging a tab from one window and dropping it into another instance of Windows Terminal.

**Benefits:**
- Improved flexibility and usability for users who need to manage multiple terminal sessions.
- Enhanced productivity by allowing users to easily organize and view their terminal sessions side by side.
- Consistency with the behavior of modern web browsers, making the feature intuitive for users.

This enhancement will provide a more seamless and efficient experience for users working with multiple tabs in Windows Terminal.
