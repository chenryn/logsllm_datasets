User: I'm a newbie to SCons and also using pydev. Can someone help me with instructions on how to debug scons scripts using Eclipse and pydev? Is it even possible considering the fact that SCons is a seperate app and not an extension to python?
Assistant: As an addendum: on Windows, I had to copy the scons-installed files to reside under C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\scons in order for this to work.  Adding the original installed location, qualified with the version number, to the PYTHONPATH, did not work.
