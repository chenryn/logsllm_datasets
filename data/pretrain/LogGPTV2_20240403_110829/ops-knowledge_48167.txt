When I place a new DAG Python script in the `dags` folder, it appears as a new entry in the Airflow DAG UI. However, the DAG is not automatically enabled, and it seems to be improperly loaded. To schedule the DAG, I have to manually refresh the list several times and toggle the on/off button next to the DAG. This manual process is required even though the DAG script is already in the `dags` folder.

Additionally, there is an indicator message that says, "This DAG isn't available in the webserver DagBag object. It shows up in this list because the scheduler marked it as active in the metadata database," which is displayed next to the DAG title before I perform these manual steps.

Is this the expected behavior in Airflow, or am I missing something?

**Resolution:**
Restarting the Airflow webserver resolved the issue for me.
