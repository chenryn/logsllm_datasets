### Figure 3: Alexa and Umbrella Heatmaps

**Figure 3.** Heatmaps showing the mean Wednesday market share of website categories ± the difference to the mean Sunday market share (used to color each cell) in exponentially increasing list intervals (1–10, 11–100, 101–1,000, etc.) from March to April 2018. Categories are ordered by their mean Wednesday market share for the top 1 million domains. On Sundays, fewer office-related domains and more entertainment domains are observed. For Majestic, see Figure 10 in the appendix. (Color figure online)

### Market Share Distribution

The market share of certain categories can increase threefold on weekends. Additionally, the distribution of categories appears to be slightly more even during the weekend. The top 10 domains (Table 4) in Alexa, and to some extent the top 100, remain stable between the workweek and the weekend. In contrast, Umbrella shows significant changes in the top 10 categories due to the addition of two new domains. These results confirm the preliminary findings by Scheitle et al. [30], which suggest that Alexa and Umbrella are dominated by office traffic during the workweek and leisure traffic during the weekend.

### Clusters in Domain Rankings

#### Cluster Analysis

The rankings in Alexa and Umbrella contain large clusters of alphabetically sorted domain names. (Umbrella uses an atypical sorting order when dashes and prefixes are involved: ab-c before ab.) We assume these clusters represent domains that cannot be distinguished based on their traffic characteristics.

#### Cluster Size and Rank

To explore the minimum size thresholds for considering a sorted sublist as a cluster, we plot the percentage of domains that would be considered part of any cluster in Figure 4. Majestic has only very small clusters, with fewer than 0.05% of the list being part of clusters if they were required to be larger than 42 domains. Applying the same threshold to the other lists, more than 54% of Alexa and more than 91% of Umbrella appear in a cluster.

#### Cluster Characteristics

To understand the sizes and rank locations of clusters, Figure 5 plots the length of each alphabetically ordered sublist against its first rank. In Alexa, larger clusters start appearing at ranks around 49k, with outliers of 40k and 87k domains. The size of clusters does not increase monotonically. Majestic, shown in Figure 8 in the appendix, has no significant clusters except for a few outliers in the last third of the list. In Umbrella, clusters larger than 42 domains start at rank 83k (rank 126k with a threshold of 100). The size of clusters appears to grow exponentially towards the end of the list, but the last cluster is likely truncated as it does not follow the increasing trend. Furthermore, clusters on Wednesdays are one-third to half the size of those on Sundays, suggesting that Umbrella's ranking is based on less traffic on Sundays, as larger clusters imply more indistinguishable domains.

### Implications for Users

These clusters have several important implications for users of the lists:
1. **Rank Assignment**: While one might expect that domains with equivalent traffic would receive the same rank, Alexa and Umbrella assign individual ranks in alphabetical order within clusters. This can cause large rank differences, such as 87k in Alexa.
2. **Truncation Effects**: The last cluster of the ranking is often cut off, extending the list beyond 1 million entries. Researchers using list prefixes without accounting for clusters may exclude domains based on lexicographical order rather than popularity.
3. **Stability Issues**: A domain with stable traffic may receive a worse rank if domains with equivalent traffic but lower lexicographical ordering are added. Similarly, switching between adjacent clusters can cause significant rank changes despite minor traffic variations.

### Best Practices for Using Top Domain Lists

Our analysis reveals various characteristics of the lists compiled by Alexa, Majestic, and Umbrella. To minimize the negative impact of these characteristics on measurement results, we propose the following best practices:

1. **Avoid Direct Correlation with Rank**: Use aggregates based on exponentially increasing rank intervals (e.g., 1–10, 11–100, 101–1000, etc.) instead of direct rank correlation.
2. **Use Contemporaneous Rankings**: Label historical datasets with the rank current at the time of the recorded event.
3. **Measure Static Sets of Domains**: Short-term noise from list composition, such as the weekend effect, can make it challenging to interpret changes. Consider using a static list of domains for measurements.
4. **Account for Subdomains**: Depending on the context, measure all subdomains or use one (sub)domain per unique registered domain.
5. **Use Lists According to Their Definition of Popularity**: Each list represents different data, so use them accordingly.
6. **Limit to Highest-Ranked 100k Domains**: Only the top 100k domains in Alexa are statistically significant.
7. **Use Multiple Sources**: Mitigate limitations by measuring domains from multiple lists in parallel.
8. **Do Not Assume Ranked Domains are Benign**: Malicious domains exist in the Alexa ranking, so do not assume all ranked domains are benign.

### Conclusion

Many security research papers use top domain rankings from Alexa, Majestic, or Umbrella. Each list models popularity differently, leading to variations in country and category distribution. Some lists exhibit immediate reactivity to traffic changes, making weekday and weekend rankings distinct. Properly accounting for these characteristics is crucial for reproducibility and avoiding bias in research results. We have proposed best practices for the use of top domain lists in security measurements.
