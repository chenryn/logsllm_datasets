Running TestSS2TF.tst_matrix_shapes(p,q,r) (signal/tests/test_ltisys.py, line
14, scipy 0.11.0) with p,q,r values like in the test, and repeated here:  
(3,3,3)  
(1,3,3)  
(1,1,3)
However, it will fail with:  
(2,3,3)  
(2,2,3)
and so on where p is not the same as r, and is also not 1. Traceback below:

        type_test = A[:, 0] + B[:, 0] + C[0, :] + D
    ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (2) (3) 
I suspect that D should be subscripted in the type_test assignment in
ltisys.py, but I haven't dug far enough to know if it will still work even if
the type_test is changed.
