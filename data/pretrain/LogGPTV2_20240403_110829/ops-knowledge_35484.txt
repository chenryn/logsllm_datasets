User: I have an Amazon Ubuntu instance which I stop and start (not terminate). I was wondering if it is possible to run a script on start and stop of the server. Specifically, I am looking at writting a python boto script to take my RDS volume offline when the EC2 server is not running.
Can anyone tell me if this is possible please?
Assistant: It is possible. You just have to write an init script and setup proper symbolic links in /etc/rc#.d directories. It will be started with a parameter start or stop depending on if machine is starting up or shutting down.
