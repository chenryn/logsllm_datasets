### Summary of the Log Chunk

The provided log chunk, spanning from 18:10:21 to 18:10:26 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues and address changes in a Hadoop environment. Here is a step-by-step summary:

1. **Address Changes Detected**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes repeatedly detect an address change for the server `msra-sa-41`. 
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` (for `LeaseRenewer`) and `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` (for `RMCommunicator Allocator`).
   - The new address is `msra-sa-41:9000` and `msra-sa-41:8030`, respectively.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times.
   - The duration of these failures increases incrementally from 323 seconds to 328 seconds.
   - Each failure is followed by a message indicating that the process will retry shortly.

3. **Connection Issues with RM Server**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` process encounters errors while trying to contact the Resource Manager (RM) server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - It logs an error message `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM` multiple times.
   - The process attempts to retry connecting to the server, following a retry policy with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each retry.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Components**:
  - The log entries are timestamped from 18:10:21 to 18:10:26.
  - The relevant components are `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`, `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`, and `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`.

- **Log Levels**:
  - The log levels include `WARN` for address changes and lease renewal failures, and `INFO` and `ERROR` for connection retries and errors, respectively.

- **Recurring Patterns**:
  - The address changes and lease renewal failures occur every second.
  - The connection retries and errors also occur periodically, with the retry count being reset to 0 each time.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with address resolution and network connectivity in the Hadoop environment. Specifically, the `LeaseRenewer` is unable to renew a lease for a DFS client, and the `RMCommunicator Allocator` is failing to connect to the RM server. These issues are likely causing disruptions in the Hadoop cluster's operations. Further investigation into the network configuration and server status is recommended to resolve these problems.
