**Current behavior**  
Putting styles with a `/deep/` selector bleeds into sibling components.
When I have a component on one route with a style of the following:
    /deep/ app-my-header {
      header {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    }
If I then navigate to another component (not a child component) the styles
from the sibling route still persist on the `app-my-header`.
**Expected behavior**  
Styles should not bleed outside of their component even when using the
`/deep/` selector.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
We have styles to a header that changes as we navigate through the
application, this bleeding causes breaking changes across route events.
