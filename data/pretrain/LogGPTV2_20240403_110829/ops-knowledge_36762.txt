User: Please provide an effective solution to alleviate the high CPU and memory usage of the system under high load.
Assistant: There are several effective solutions to alleviate the high CPU and memory usage of the system under high load conditions: 1. Increase hardware resources: Upgrading the CPU, increasing the memory or using a faster hard disk can improve the system processing capacity. This is the most straightforward solution, but usually comes at a higher cost. 2. Optimize program code: Optimizing program code can make the program run faster under the same hardware resources, reducing CPU and memory usage. You can use an optimizer or check the resource usage of each program to find abnormal or inefficient code and optimize it. 3. Distributed architecture: split the system into multiple independent business modules, and distribute the system load to different nodes through distributed deployment to reduce the load of a single node. 4. Cache data: You can use cache to store popular data, improve data access speed, and reduce the load on the back-end database. 5. Use a load balancer: use a load balancer to evenly distribute requests to different servers to reduce the load on each server. 6. Current limiting and circuit breaker: When the system reaches peak traffic, you can use the current limiting tool to limit the requested traffic. When the system load is too high, a fuse can be used to suspend some requests to avoid service crashes. Through the comprehensive application of the above solutions, the situation of excessive CPU and memory usage of the system under high load conditions can be effectively alleviated.
