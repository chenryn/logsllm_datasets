When I use Code on a touch-enabled device with a stylus rather than a mouse,
it is very difficult to use the folding gutter, as it is hidden unless the
pointer is hovering over it. While having that gutter hidden when I am not
using it nicely reduces visual noise, there are times that I need it to always
be there.
Why not provide a configuration item that allows the user to switch between
having it be always visible or only visible on hover?
