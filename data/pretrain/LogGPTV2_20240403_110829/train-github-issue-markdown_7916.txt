While training a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GaussianHMM), I occasionally encounter the following error:

```
File "train_states.py", line 156, in <module>
    best_seq = model.decode(t)
...
numpy.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError: 2-th leading minor not positive definite
```

Could this be due to underflow?

### Detailed Error Trace:
- **File:** `train_states.py`, **Line:** 156
- **Function Call:** `best_seq = model.decode(t)`
- **Traceback:**
  - `sklearn/hmm.py`, **Line:** 304, **Function:** `decode`
  - `sklearn/hmm.py`, **Line:** 241, **Function:** `_decode_viterbi`
  - `sklearn/hmm.py`, **Line:** 743, **Function:** `_compute_log_likelihood`
  - `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, **Line:** 56, **Function:** `log_multivariate_normal_density`
  - `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py`, **Line:** 603, **Function:** `_log_multivariate_normal_density_full`
  - `scipy/linalg/decomp_cholesky.py`, **Line:** 66, **Function:** `cholesky`
  - `scipy/linalg/decomp_cholesky.py`, **Line:** 24, **Function:** `_cholesky`
- **Error Message:** `numpy.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError: 2-th leading minor not positive definite`

### Possible Cause:
The error message indicates that the Cholesky decomposition of a covariance matrix failed because the matrix is not positive definite. This can occur if the covariance matrix is singular or nearly singular, which might be caused by issues such as:
- **Underflow:** Very small values in the covariance matrix can lead to numerical instability.
- **Data Issues:** Insufficient or highly correlated data can result in a non-positive definite covariance matrix.

### Suggested Solutions:
1. **Check for Underflow:**
   - Ensure that the values in your covariance matrix are within a reasonable range. Consider using log-space computations or scaling your data to avoid underflow.
2. **Regularize the Covariance Matrix:**
   - Add a small constant to the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix to ensure it is positive definite. For example, you can use `covars += epsilon * np.eye(covars.shape[0])` where `epsilon` is a small positive value.
3. **Inspect Data:**
   - Verify that your training data is sufficient and not highly correlated. Consider preprocessing steps like dimensionality reduction or feature selection to improve the quality of your data.

By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to mitigate the error and successfully train your GaussianHMM.
