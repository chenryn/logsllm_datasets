  * OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Archlinux
  * TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
  * TensorFlow version (use command below): v1.12.1-3374-g9eb67b17bf 2.0.0-dev20190605

**Describe the current behavior**
I expect to do a forward pass with a model with a BachNormalization layer in
training mode, when using the `tf.distribuite.MirroredStrategy` but I can't,
because it reises the following exception:
> RuntimeError: `add_update` was called in a cross-replica context. This is
> not expected. If you require this feature, please file an issue.
Why it is not expected?
**Describe the expected behavior**
It should work.  
The commit that introduced this behavior is:
`316cd57`#diff-8eb7e20502209f082d0cb15119a50413
**Code to reproduce the issue**
    import tensorflow as tf
    model = tf.keras.Sequential(
        [
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),
            tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1),
        ]
    )
    strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
    with strategy.scope():
        out = model(tf.zeros((1, 10)), training=True)
