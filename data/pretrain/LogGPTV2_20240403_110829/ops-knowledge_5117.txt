User: I'd like to write some Python unit tests for my Google App Engine.  How can I set that up?  Does someone happen to have some sample code which shows how to write a simple test?
Assistant: Since, gae is based on webhooks it can be easy to set your own testing framework for all relevant urls in your app.yaml. You can test it on sample dataset on development server ( start devel server with --datastore_path option ) and assert writes to database or webhook responses.
