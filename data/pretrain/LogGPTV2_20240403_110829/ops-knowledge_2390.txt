User: With python3 previously installed via homebrew on macOS, I just downloaded miniconda (via homebrew cask), which brought in another full python setup, I believe.
Is it possible to install anaconda/miniconda without reinstalling python?
And, if so, would that be a bad idea?
Assistant: Anaconda comes with python for you but do not remove the original python that comes with the system -- many of the operating system's libs depend on it.
Anaconda manages its python executable and packages in its own (conda) directory. It changes the system path so the python inside the conda directory is the one used when you access python.
