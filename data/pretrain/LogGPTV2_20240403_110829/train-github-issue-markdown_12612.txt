It appears that cd() and at least a few other file handling functions can't
handle that directories have spaces in their names.
The problem exists on the build above (on MacOS) and I have earlier today
experienced equal behaviour on Windows 10 x64;
    julia> cd("/Users/user/Virtualbox\ Shared\ Folder/")
    ERROR: syntax: invalid escape sequence
    Stacktrace:
     [1] top-level scope at REPL[7]:0
This may be an issue with how the tab-completion escapes the directory name,
but...the escaping looks good to me. And it is identical to how Bash would
have done it in a shell.
