INTRODUCTION  
1 
Implementing the principle of open public administration in today’s eGovernment initiatives 
represents a significant challenge to the architects of both administrative procedures and the 
supporting IT systems: Protecting the privacy of the citizen, while providing rich, coherent 
services  spanning  multiple  administration  areas,  calls  for  new  design  principles  and 
technologies. 
The  term  Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies  (PETs)  represents  a  spectrum  of  both  new  and 
well-known  techniques  to  minimize  the  exposure  of  private  data,  for  users  of  electronic 
services  in  the  information  society.  However,  the  term  does  not  have  a  widely  accepted 
definition, and the scope of PETs is often depending on the usage scenario. 
This study has been initiated by the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, 
in  order  to  improve  the  ministry’s  background  knowledge  of  PETs  and  to  describe  the 
possible  scenarios  of  use.  An  important  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  propose  a  high  level 
classification of Privacy Enhancing Technologies, with a corresponding classification of the 
most  significant  products  on  the  market  and  their  features.  The  report  is  intended  to  help 
officials evaluate the feasibility of employing PET in the electronic communication between 
public  administration,  private  enterprises  and  consumers.  The  scope  of  the  analysis  is  to 
provide a European view, focused on the situation in Denmark, UK, Germany and common 
EU activities. Global trends will be included where applicable. 
To explore this issue in depth, META Group has carried out research with European thought 
leaders with a view of understanding how the players in major information security initiatives 
are addressing the privacy challenge. META Group conducted a series of in-depth interviews 
with key persons in Europe during the summer and fall of 2004. The research yielded a wide 
range of views on how public and private organizations in Europe are viewing the privacy 
issue, and which technologies they use to provide solutions. Participants in the research were 
distributed  across  the  manufacturing,  finance,  telecommunications,  government,  and  utility 
sectors.

2  MANAGEMENT SUMMARY 
For the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, META Group has carried 
out research with European thought leaders with a view of understanding how the players in 
major information security initiatives are addressing the privacy challenge.  
Protecting privacy is focused on reducing the information collected and stored to a minimum, 
and deleting the information, as soon as it has served its purpose. But these principles are 
challenged by the individual’s need for convenient electronic services, and by the need for 
efficiency of eBusiness or eGovernment transactions. Most of today’s e-services are relying 
on stored data, identifying the customer, his preferences and previous record of transactions. 
However,  combining  such  data  will  in  many  cases  constitute  an  invasion  of  privacy.  The 
purpose of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) is to protect the privacy of individuals, 
while still enabling them to interact with other parties in a modern society, using electronic 
communications. 
The  term  Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies  (PETs)  represents  a  spectrum  of  both  new  and 
well-known  techniques  to  minimize  the  exposure  of  private  data,  for  users  of  electronic 
services  in  the  information  society.  However,  the  term  does  not  have  a  widely  accepted 
definition, and the scope of PETs is often depending on the usage scenario. 
META Group’s research revealed a broad consensus regarding the need for privacy, and a 
general recognition of the fact, that the design of today’s IT systems and networks is a serious 
challenge to privacy: The public IT infrastructure should be designed, or redesigned, to put 
the  user  in  control  of  his  own  personal  information  and  his  private  sphere.  But  given  the 
extent  of  the  infrastructure,  and  the  considerable  commercial  and  state  interests  in  the 
collection  of  personal  data,  this  will  not  happen  overnight.  In  the  meantime,  a  number  of 
Privacy Enhancing Technologies can be used to improve the protection of privacy in selected 
areas and cases. 
The current privacy threats fall in three major classes:  
A)  Loss of confidentiality 
B)  Identity theft 
C)  Unsolicited messages (spam).  
Privacy Enhancing Technologies can be used to improve the protection of privacy in order to 
minimize the threats of all three classes: Some of the privacy tools are actively involved in 
the  information  storage  and  transport,  while  others  are  supporting  the  administration  of 
privacy.  This  report  proposes  two  main  categories  of  Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies: 
Privacy  Protection  and  Privacy  Management.  The  first  category  contains  tools  and 
technologies that are actively involved in protecting the privacy, e.g. by  hiding the private 
information,  or  by  eliminating  the  need  for  personal  identification.  The  second  category, 
Privacy  Management,  contains  tools  and  technologies  that  support  the  administration  of 
privacy rules, rather than processing the information itself.  
The  purpose  of  the  Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies  is  to  obtain  one  or more  of  the  three 
main privacy aspects:

1.  Unobservability – making private information invisible or unavailable to others 
2.  Unlinkability – preventing others from linking different pieces of observed 
information together 
3.  Anonymity – preventing others from connecting observed information with a 
specific person 
The report organizes the Privacy Enhancing Technologies into subcategories, and it explains 
how  the  technical  features  of  the  privacy  solutions  support  each  of  the  privacy  aspects 
mentioned above. 
A  number  of  use  cases  illustrate  common  situations  from  the  “old  world”,  where  the 
protection  of  privacy  traditionally  has  been  an  integrated  part  of  the  transaction,  e.g.  in 
recruiting  agencies.  When  such  transactions  are  implemented  using  electronic  services, 
special care must be taken to protect the privacy of the individuals, and the use of privacy 
tools will be relevant. Other use cases show how the deployment of new technologies, such 
as Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), for remote identification of products sold 
in a supermarket, can form a privacy threat for the consumer. Here, the new technology must 
have a privacy-aware design in order to gain wide acceptance. 
Most of today’s Privacy Enhancing Technologies are conceptually add-on products, designed 
to compensate flaws in original design of IT systems and information handling procedures. 
But  adding  PETs  to  existing  legacy  applications  can  impact  the  efficiency,  reliability  and 
robustness  of  the  service.  To  make  existing  systems  “privacy-compliant”,  the  design 
principles  must  be  revised,  and  central  parts  of  the  design  must  be  reworked.  The  effort 
required to conduct such a process is considerable, and the timeframe is very large. 
The  overall  maturity  of  privacy  solutions  is  currently  considered  low.  Standardization  of 
privacy  features  and  solutions  is  yet  to  come  –  the  current  PET  solutions  are  rarely 
interoperable  (with  a  few  notable  exceptions),  because  a  common  understanding  of  the 
concepts  and  requirements  has  not  been  established.  However,  still  awaiting  the  formal 
standardization  of  PETs,  some  best  practices  have  emerged  in  the  area  of  privacy  policy 
generation and compliance control. 
Many  industries  already  use  PETs,  especially  when  more  parties  have  to  share  some  data, 
while other data must be kept separate. The PETs used in such cases will often be embedded 
in custom-built solutions, rather than being added to a standard system.  It is expected that 
tomorrow’s privacy solutions will be an integrated part of public and private administrative 
solutions,  based  on  an  architecture,  where  privacy  has  been  an  integral  part  of  the  design 
criteria.  
Today’s  public  administrative  systems  are  only  including  limited  privacy  protecting 
functionality, while the law requires the administrative staff to follow procedures that protect 
the citizen’s privacy. Unfortunately, many E-Government service developments follow this 
trend,  by  not  rating  privacy  principles  high  in  their  basic  design  criteria.  Privacy-aware 
design  (of  data,  applications  and  procedures)  is  key  to  obtaining  privacy,  but  very  few 
examples of this have been seen. 
It is expected, that companies delivering Internet shopping and other electronic services will 
respond  to  the  customer’s  need  for  privacy,  by  offering  appropriate  functionality,  such  as
