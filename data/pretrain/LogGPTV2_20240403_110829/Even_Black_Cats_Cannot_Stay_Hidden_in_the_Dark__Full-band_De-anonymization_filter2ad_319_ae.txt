IX. DISCUSSION
The BT vulnerability we uncover can have serious
privacy implications as users rely increasingly more on
connected devices. Arguably, the most serious risk is that
of protracted surveillance, whereby a user’s locations can
be tracked with concealed wireless equipment, once their
identity is linked to that of a BT device they own. For

instance, road video footage used together with vehicle
license plate recognition software could be employed to
identify a smart car owner and the car’s BT address.
It would then be possible to track the person without
expensive video infrastructure, by only using BT sniffers,
as the system we presented. This is feasible with our
approach if deploying a camera next to the developed
sniffer, pointing this towards incoming trafﬁc. One can
acquire a video frame every 100 ms, process it, and
discard the data. Character segmentation and optical
recognition [24] can be used to detect plate numbers.
As wearables adoption grows [25], both the risk of
surveillance and potential beneﬁts of passenger ﬂow
monitoring could be exploited with our BT snifﬁng
(and de-anonymization) system in urban settings. This
would require deployment of snifﬁng infrastructure only
at strategically selected hubs/checkpoints, such as airport
terminals, train stations, road tunnels, or bridge cross-
ings. For instance, there are only 21 main bridges and
16 tunnels that connect Manhattan to other boroughs of
New York City and New Jersey. Deploying our system at
such locations could offer insights into commuter ﬂows.
Mitigation: Preserving BT device anonymity would
require a new revision of the Bluetooth standard. While
it is unreasonable to expect the whitening and HEC
generation procedures to be modiﬁed, given the number
of BT devices already on the market, full address or UAP
randmomization should be feasible. Cryptographically
generated addresses similar to those used in BLE or pro-
posed for IPv6 [26] could be used, by which the 64-bit
device identiﬁer would be created with a cryptographic
hash of information exchanged by peers during pairing.
X. RELATED WORK
Connection oriented Bluetooth tracking was proposed
indoor localization of users,
in [27] for room-level
with the goal of colleague searching and optimization
of building heating/cooling. However, the system only
works as long as target devices deliberately perform a
one-off registration. Early room-level tracking without
explicit user consent exploits the Bluetooth inquiry pro-
cess (see, e.g., [28], [29]). Bluetooth devices commonly
become “undiscoverable” after pairing, which questions
the practicality of early tracking approaches. Spill and
Bittau investigate the feasibility of eavesdropping on
undiscoverable devices and develop the ﬁrst open-source
BT sniffer [30]. This solution is limited to a single
channel, relies on cyclic redundancy checks that are
not present
in many BT proﬁles (or are encrypted),
which yields high false positive and miss detection rates,
questioning it practicality, as we have shown. Recent
work uses passive snifﬁng based on Ubertooth together
with active inquiry scanning to empirically verify the
feasibility of this approach for forensics and surveillance
purposes [31]. The value of the ﬁndings is limited,
given the shortcomings of single-channel snifﬁng and
imprecise detection of this platform. A dual-radio Uber-
tooth setup is used in [32] to jam and predict adaptive
hoping sequences,
in view of BT/BLE snifﬁng. De-
anonymization is however not pursued, unlike in our
approach which doesn’t require active jamming, since
we are able to eavesdrop on all channels simultaneously.
Previous work also scrutinizes BLE privacy. Beacons
were used to establish a user’s indoor location [33],
which together with physical ﬁngerprinting [34] can
underpin user tracking. M. Ryan highlights the simplicity
of snooping on BLE by exploiting the advertisement
messages sent periodically on dedicated channels [35].
Although the standard introduces address randomization,
Fawaz et al. show that more than 200 BLE devices
studied reveal their presence to adversaries and propose
an external management solution to mitigate this prob-
lem [12]. An SDR tool for BLE/Wi-Fi debugging is pro-
posed in [36], where multi-channel capture is considered.
BT is however substantially different than BLE and with
the advent of SDR platforms and the growing popularity
of connected car/wireless entertainment based on BT,
user privacy is at risk, as we revealed.
XI. CONCLUSIONS
We practically demonstrated that BT is inadequate for
ensuring user identity and location privacy. We proved
that apart from a 1/2 uncertainty about a master’s UAP,
which can be resolved through header data inspection,
the meaningful part of the master BT address is recov-
erable with a limited number of packets and without
requiring to examine the frames’ payloads, which can
be encrypted. We empirically proved the beneﬁts of
capturing the entire BT spectrum with a full-band SDR
system that we developed. With the decreasing costs of
SDR platforms, BT snifﬁng will no longer be conﬁned
to single-channel snifﬁng. As such, user privacy is at risk
and calls for revising the Bluetooth speciﬁcation.

APPENDIX
A. Bluetooth Protocol Operation
We brieﬂy describe basic concepts that we use to
explain our device address de-anonymization attack.
a) Physical Layer: BT adopts a Frequency-
hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) channel access
scheme. The 2.4 GHz band is divided into 79 contiguous
channels, each of 1-MHz. Data frames are modulated
using binary GFSK after bits are obfuscated through a

whitening procedure. By this, data is passed through a
LFSR initialized with part of the internal clock.
All BT frames start with an Access Code followed
by a header. Different types of frames are deﬁned for
different services (e.g., keep-alive, audio streaming, etc.),
each of which has speciﬁc FEC following the header
that is protected with Hamming codes. As we show, we
exploit the header protection mechanism to reverse the
obfuscation applied over the entire frame.
b) MAC Layer: Throughout the different phases
a BT device undergoes when communicating, from
advertising (i.e. when a device is “discoverable” or
“scannable”), to scanning, and data exchange, it hops
across different channels 1,600 times per second. The
exact hopping sequence is negotiated and shared by ac-
tively communicating devices. Each piece of BT equip-
ment is identiﬁed by a 6-byte MAC address that does
not change over time. This address is logically divided
into three parts: a 2-byte NAP, a 1-byte UAP, and a
3-byte LAP. Devices form “piconets”, where a master
periodically polls slaves and all the frames exchanged
contain the LAP of the master.
to other devices within range. For this,
c) Network Formation: A master establishing a
piconet initiates a discovery procedure to identify and
connect
the
master broadcasts inquiries over 32 wake-up carriers,
which are equally spaced in the 79 MHz range, hopping
following a pseudo-random sequence that is derived from
its MAC address. Such packets are identiﬁed by an
Inquiry Access Code (IAC) that is known to all devices.
All devices listen periodically (every 1.28 s) for in-
quiries on a single frequency chosen from the set of 32
wake-up carriers, for a total duration of 11.25 ms. This
“inquiry scanning” frequency also changes, according to
the device’s own hopping sequence. When receiving an
inquiry frame, a device enters a back-off procedure and
remains on the channel where the inquiry was received,
for a random number of time slots uniformly distributed
in the [0, 1024) range (in order to reduce the probability
of collision with others that have received the same
inquiry). After back-off, the device returns to inquiry
scan mode and, upon receiving a second inquiry,
it
replies in the next slot with a Frequency Hopping Syn-
chronization (FHS) message, which contains the address
of the device and its clock offset [37]. Note that non-
discoverable devices may no longer respond to inquiries
after establishing communication with a master.
If an inquiry is successful, the master enters a paging
mode and hops on a sequence derived from the slave’s
address, sending a page message to the device it wants

to connect to. This contains a so-called Device Access
Code (DAC) derived from the lower 24 bits of the paged
device’s address. An acknowledgement
is sent back,
which contains the slave ID. The master then sends a
FHS frame, which the slave will use to subsequently
follow the master’s hopping sequence; this is computed
based on the master’s UAP and part of its clock. This
sequence is conﬁrmed with another page response. The
master then assigns a 3-bit AMA to the slave and the
connection is established.
B. Privacy Infringements on the Move
Another experiment we conduct is with our snifﬁng
system deployed inside a car, with the antenna pointing
opposite to the direction of movement, while we drive
the car on the highway. Our aim is to assess how many
unique UAPs an attacker could infer under different
trafﬁc conditions, as the snifﬁng system moves with
speeds ranging between 5 and 120 km/h depending on
road congestion levels, and verify how often we identify
the same target, thereby offering perspectives on the
surveillance risks to which connected cars are exposed
through the de-anonymization attack we uncover.
Fig. 16 illustrates our ﬁndings. Over the entire travel
duration, our system is able to detect over 250 dis-
tinct BT-powered cars. More importantly, during periods
when trafﬁc is slow, we can re-identify several targets
multiple times. This highlights the potential of employ-
ing the privacy attack we uncover to follow targets while
remaining visually undetectable, since many of these
vehicle are hundreds of meters away from the sniffer,
mostly not within line of sight.
