Question: In a multi-tenant environment where each tenant's workload runs in a shared kernel space, what are the potential limitations or challenges associated with relying on the following isolation mechanisms?
"A": "Linux containers may not provide sufficient isolation due to the shared kernel, potentially allowing kernel vulnerabilities to affect all containers.",
"B": "Seccomp-bpf filters can effectively limit the system calls a process can invoke, fully mitigating the issue of a wide kernel attack surface.",
"C": "Using a mandatory access control system can prevent many types of unauthorized actions, but it may not address all kernel-level vulnerabilities.",
"D": "Language runtimes offer complete isolation from kernel vulnerabilities by not relying on the Linux kernel for execution."
