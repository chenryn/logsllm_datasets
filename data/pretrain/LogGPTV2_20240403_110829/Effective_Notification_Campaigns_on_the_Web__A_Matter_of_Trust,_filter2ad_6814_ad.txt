been remediated why the problem has not been solved yet
(N = 54; multiple responses possible). 22 owners responded
that the problem was unknown, 20 responded that they did not
know how to solve the problem. Some owners mentioned that
the problem had no priority (12 responses), they did not ﬁnd
time to deal with the issue (10 responses), or the notiﬁcation
did not seem serious (6 responses).
6.2 Trust in Notiﬁcation
In the survey 316 out of 460 (68.7 %) website owners (rather)
agreed with the statement that the notiﬁcation made a trust-
worthy impression. The notiﬁcation from the law group was
perceived most trustworthy and the one from the citizen least
trustworthy. For the remaining two factors, the differences are
less pronounced (cf. Figure 4).
Which factors led participants to trust or distrust our mes-
sage? To investigate this, we asked two open questions, with
377 participants responding to the trust question and 252 par-
ticipants to the distrust question (multiple responses possible).
The resulting trust-related factors can be grouped into formal,
content-related, and veriﬁability aspects.

USENIX Association
Veriﬁability Increases Trust While 11 out of 252 (4.4 %)
participants stated that they generally do not trust information
from unknown senders, in 119 out of 377 (31.6 %) responses,
the possibility of veriﬁcation was rated as trust-promoting.
This includes that they could verify the sender, which some
did by calling the provided number to ensure that the letter
was sent by the claimed person. For others, this includes
verifying the facts through their own research or with the help
of experts or acquaintances.
6.3 Problem Solving and Support
With our notiﬁcation, we wanted to support the site owners.
Therefore, we asked to what extent the explanation in the noti-
ﬁcation and the self-service tool were helpful and whether the
participants would like to receive notiﬁcations in the future.
Problem Solving 339 out of 437 (77.6 %) of the partici-
pants stated that they were able to understand the problem
of missing IP Anonymization from the notiﬁcation. Many
participants who had resolved the problem stated that they
had done this without help (37.8 %), while 30.9 % reported
that they asked their external service provider to resolve the
problem. 13.0 % forwarded the issue to colleagues in the or-
ganization and 10.8 % resolved the problem themselves after
getting help (other: 7.5 %, N = 362).
Helpfulness of Self-Service Tool The CheckGA tool was
rated as (very) helpful by the majority of participants (87.2 %;
266 out of 305). This is in line with the fact that the tool
has frequently been mentioned as a trust-building factor. An-
other 51 respondents said they did not know the tool, and 86
participants stated they had not used it.
Future Notiﬁcations Most owners (88.4 %) wish for future
notiﬁcations about privacy issues on their website (N = 448).
The majority (84.8 %) preferred to be notiﬁed by email.
28.2 % preferred letter, 3.7 % a blog post, 3.2 % a call (1.7 %
preferred something else, e. g., a service portal; N = 401;
multiple answers possible). 30.5 % stated that they would be
willing to pay for such notiﬁcations (N = 383).
7 Discussion
Our goal was to determine the factors that inﬂuence the suc-
cess of a notiﬁcation using both measurements and a survey of
owners. In this section, we review the most important results
of both approaches and highlight where their results diverge.
We then compare our results with those of prior work.

that the notiﬁcation made a trustworthy impression.
Formal Factors affecting Trust Among the formal fac-
tors, the sender appears to be of particular importance, being
named 348 times in total (multiple responses possible). Espe-
cially the reference to the university, which was mentioned
by 174 out of 377 (46.1 %) participants, seems to be relevant.
The possibility to contact the sender is also important, being
mentioned by 44 out of 377 participants (11.7 %). Another
formal aspect is the good use of language mentioned by 63 out
of 377 (16.1 %) participants, e. g., that the notiﬁcation was
“well-formulated” and “did not contain spelling mistakes”.
Of the 259 respondents that had received a letter, 25 (9.6 %)
named the fact that it was “a real letter” as trust-promoting.
Interestingly, even small aspects like the logo or letterhead
(13.0 %; 49 out of 377 respondents) and signature (3.1 %; 12
out of 377 respondents) were named as trust-promoting by
some, illustrating that even seemingly small design decisions
can have an impact on the perceived trustworthiness. How-
ever, the same factors were also causing mistrust for other
recipients, with 41 participants out of 252 (16.3 %) mention-
ing bad wording and 46 (18.2 %) the layout as leading to
distrust the notiﬁcation. 12 participants (4.8 %) stated that
receiving a letter was decreasing trust, with one participant
wondering, “Why would anyone even bother to send a letter?”
Content-Related Factors affecting Trust
In addition to
the formal aspects, there were also various aspects relating to
the content which promoted trust in the notiﬁcation. 94 out of
377 (24.3 %) responses indicate the factual correctness and
detailed explanation to be trust-promoting, and 56 (14.8 %)
participants mentioned the same about the CheckGA tool.
For several participants, the underlying motivation of the
sender was relevant. 76 out of 377 (20.2 %) participants con-
sidered it to be trust-promoting that there were no ﬁnancial
demands or proﬁt-making intentions of the sender and that the
notiﬁcation did not contain any threat. In contrast to this, 38
out of 252 (15.1 %) participants claimed that the sender’s mo-
tivation was not clear, and 64 (25.4 %) participants perceived
the notiﬁcation as a threat, spam, or ad.

Our experiment showed a high remediation rate, with 56.6 %
of all notiﬁed operators remediating within two months, com-
pared to 9.2 % of the control group. Interestingly, the time
required to remediate the issue is similar for most groups—a
large portion of owners becomes compliant within the ﬁrst
seven days of message receipt, with a much smaller number
following over the next weeks (cf. Figure 2a). However, the
spread of absolute remediation rates is high, ranging from
76.3 % to 33.9 %, indicating that the individual factors of the
notiﬁcation can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on notiﬁcation
effectiveness. We discuss these factors in greater detail here.
The Right Framing Can Have a Large Effect The fram-
ing of the message proved to be a major factor in notiﬁca-
tion success, with GDPR and GDPR+FINE signiﬁcantly out-
performing the baseline PRIVACY argument and an almost 20
percentage-point gap in survival between the extremes after
the initial notiﬁcation (all differences were statistically sig-
niﬁcant, both before the reminder and when considering the
full timeframe). Mentioning legal requirements and potential
ﬁnes seems to increase the perceived severity of the issue and
encourage the site owners to prioritize its resolution.
The Choice of Messenger Matters Our results show that
UNI-LAW signiﬁcantly outperforms the UNI-CS group, achiev-
ing a remediation rate of 59.7 % compared to the 54 % of
UNI-CS (p < 0.05), showing that the sender can make a sig-
niﬁcant difference in notiﬁcation campaigns. The CITIZEN
group shows only statistically insigniﬁcant differences to the
other two groups, falling between them with a remediation
rate of 56.1 %. We will return to this in Section 7.3.
Letters Increase Remediation, but at a Cost Sending a
letter instead of an email while leaving the other factors un-
changed had a highly signiﬁcant impact (p < 0.0001), increas-
ing the remediation rate by between 3.9 and 17.9 percentage
points (mean: 11.1). However, this beneﬁt should be weighed
against the costs, which can be prohibitively expensive (we
spent around 5000 C on domestic postage in total), especially
for international notiﬁcations.
Reachability Remains a Challenge Despite manually col-
lecting contact information from a source that is legally man-
dated to be correct, we did not reach all recipients. The rate of
undeliverable messages (3.5 % of letters, 5.8 % of emails for
the ﬁrst notiﬁcation) was surprisingly high, considering the
care we took in data collection. This suggests that some of
the websites were not well-maintained, which may also have
contributed to the presence of misconﬁgurations.
Persistence Pays Off Although human error prevents us
from conducting a comprehensive analysis of the effect of our
reminders, some of the results, not affected by our mistake,
show the reminder increasing the overall remediation rates.
The group that beneﬁted most from the reminder was UNI-
LAW – LETTER – GDPR+FINE, where 45.3 % of the websites
that were still non-compliant one month after the ﬁrst noti-
ﬁcation became compliant after our reminder (cf. Table 4).
Overall, 41.2 % of all notiﬁed owners remediated before the
reminder, which was increased to 56.6 % by the reminder.
Strong Demand for Self-Service Tools Finally, many site
owners beneﬁted from our self-service tool CheckGA that
helped them to understand the problem and to verify their
remediation attempts. 46.9 % of all notiﬁed site owners used
CheckGA at least once. 67.6 % of owners that had become
compliant by the end of the study used CheckGA. It was also
discussed outside of our study, with several data protection
experts and consultancies tweeting or writing articles about it,
which may have contributed to the 3.1 % of the control group
that also used the tool.
7.2 Survey of Owners
The results of the survey conﬁrm the empirical results in many
places. However, in some places, we observed interesting
discrepancies, which we will discuss here.
No Single Factor Consistently Increases Trust Our sur-
vey shows that even minor aspects of the notiﬁcation, like the
fact that the letters used the ofﬁcial university letterhead and
contained contact information and a signature, were impor-
tant aspects in evaluating the trustworthiness of the message.
Conversely, a minority of respondents actually listed many of
these factors as reducing their trust in the message, illustrating
that no perfect solution for everyone exists.
Distrust of Unsolicited Messages is Rampant Despite
our efforts to ensure that the message appears trustworthy to
the recipient, we found that a signiﬁcant number of recipients
initially distrusted the message and contacted the designated
contact person, sometimes in creative ways, to question the
authenticity of the message and enquire after the motivation
of sending it. Recipients in the CITIZEN – LETTER group, in
particular, were frequently puzzled by the willingness of a
private individual to spend money on a stamp to inform them
about a misconﬁguration on their website and questioned the
motives, asking about potential commercial interests or bad
intentions. However, this distrust did not necessarily translate
into (in)action, as we will see next.
Perception–Action Relationship Inconclusive We ob-
served a discrepancy between the self-reported level of trust
2500    30th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
towards our messages (cf. Figure 4) and the actual remedi-
ation rates reported in Section 5.1. While messages from a
private individual were rated as less trustworthy than those
from a computer science group at a well-known university,
they nevertheless resulted in similar remediation rates. One
possible explanation may be that the recipients questioned
the motives of the sender and were fearing that the message
was a prelude to legal action, thereby increasing the perceived
pressure to act of the message. However, as we did not collect
data on this, it remains an open question for future research.
Similarly, while the self-reported trust into emails and let-
ters are almost identical, the overall remediation rates show
a spread of 11.2 percentage points (49.1 % for EMAIL com-
pared to 60.3 % for LETTER at the end of the study). These
differences may be explainable by a different base trust for
the two media, i. e., even if the letter did not seem particularly
trustworthy, the fact that it was a letter already elevated it over
the email. This is supported anecdotally by messages from
recipients, with several claiming that they would have ignored
the notiﬁcation if it had arrived as an email. However, it may
also be partially related to differences in message delivery
success between LETTER and EMAIL due to spam ﬁlters, the
effect of which we cannot quantify.
System Owners Desire Support in Remediation 204
owners (5.1 %) asked us for support. We explained the con-
crete issue and, occasionally, provided code examples, which
sometimes required multiple rounds of emails, but frequently
resulted in successful remediation. While such individual
support is infeasible for larger notiﬁcation campaigns, it il-
lustrates the importance of providing a remediation guide
and veriﬁcation tool, which signiﬁcantly reduced the time
required to answer their questions and likely also reduced the
total number. Owners also reported passing on the notiﬁca-
tion to their web design agencies or data protection ofﬁcers,
with 44 % of owners reporting passing on the notiﬁcation to a
colleague or external contractor for resolution. These exter-
nal relationships may also have contributed to their lack of
awareness of the problem, which we will discuss next.
Owners Unaware of Tracking on their Websites
In the
survey, 19.5 % of respondents reported that they were unaware
that GA was active on their website, indicating that they were
not actually using the collected analytics data. This impres-
sion is further supported by the fact that 36 % of remediating
owners removed GA from their website instead of adding IP
Anonymization. In emails and calls, 28 out of 764 website
owners indicated that they were unaware that GA was running
on their website, and others reported that they had not looked
at the analytics data in years or that it was added by their web
designer without informing them. This raises questions of
liability and indicates that some fraction of GA installations
is unintentional or dormant, and thus can be removed without
negative consequences for the site owners.
7.3 Comparison with Prior Work
We will now discuss how our results agree with or diverge
from previous work.
Problem Awareness Some prior studies asked recipients if
they were aware of the issue(s) before receiving the notiﬁca-
tion, ﬁnding surprisingly high awareness. Durumeric et al.,
notifying about the Heartbleed issue, found that all recipients
were aware of the issue, and many had already made attempts
to remediate it [21]. Li et al. found that 46 % of recipients
had been aware, and 16 % had already attempted to remediate
[30]. Çetin et al. similarly reported that 40 % of their recipi-
ents had previously attempted to remediate [13]. Our results
paint a similar picture: 58.9 % of owners knew about the IP
anonymization feature–and 12.7 % even knew they were not
using it. These studies indicate that awareness is a necessary,
but not sufﬁcient condition for remediation.
Bounce Rates Only one prior study previously used man-
ual address collection: Stock et al. conducted a small-scale
(N = 364 over 10 groups) experiment [39]. All 91 emails were
delivered correctly, but 18 out of 67 letters (26.8 %) were re-
turned because the recipient could not be found. However,
their sample was drawn from recipients who had not reacted
to the automated notiﬁcation, leading to self-selection effects.
With 3.5 to 5.8 %, our observed bounce rates were slightly
higher for emails and lower for letters, respectively. They
remain much lower than many previous studies that used au-
tomated address collection, some of which observed bounce
rates exceeding 50 % [12, 13, 38]. This shows that manual ad-
dress collection can be translated into higher delivery success,
but some sites will still remain unreachable.
To compare our address collection methodology with
approaches from previous work, we analyzed all 4425
email addresses that we collected from the imprints. Three
of the previous studies [13, 38, 39] sent notiﬁcations
to common addresses such as {info,abuse,security,host-
master,webmaster}@domain.tld. While some of the addresses
we collected do match one of the addresses used in previous
work (41.0 % of addresses had the form PI:EMAIL,
0.8 % were {webmaster,hostmaster}@domain.tld), a substan-
tial proportion does not match addresses used in previous
work (21.1 % had a different address preﬁx, and 37.1 % of
addresses listed an entirely different domain). Note, however,
that we do not know whether the addresses used in previous
work would have worked as well (while not being listed in the
imprint). Thus, our reported data on the availability of these
addresses only poses a lower bound.
Effects of Message Sender Three prior studies considered
different senders: Çetin et al. sent messages posing as a pri-
vate security researcher, a university, and a well-known anti-
malware organization [12]. Stock et al. compared emails that
