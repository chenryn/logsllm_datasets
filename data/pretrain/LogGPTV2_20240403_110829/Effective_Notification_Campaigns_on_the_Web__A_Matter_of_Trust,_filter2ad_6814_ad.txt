### 5. Remediation and Problem Solving

#### 5.1 Reasons for Non-Remediation
Despite the notifications, some issues remained unresolved. Out of 54 owners (with multiple responses possible), 22 indicated that the problem was unknown, and 20 stated they did not know how to solve it. Other reasons included:
- Lack of priority (12 responses)
- Insufficient time to address the issue (10 responses)
- Perception that the notification was not serious (6 responses)

#### 5.2 Trust in Notifications
In the survey, 316 out of 460 (68.7%) website owners (somewhat) agreed that the notification made a trustworthy impression. The law group's notification was perceived as the most trustworthy, while the citizen's notification was seen as the least trustworthy. The differences between the other two factors were less pronounced (see Figure 4).

**Factors Influencing Trust:**
To understand the factors that influenced trust or distrust, we asked two open-ended questions. 377 participants responded to the trust question, and 252 responded to the distrust question (multiple responses possible). The trust-related factors can be categorized into formal, content-related, and verifiability aspects.

**Verifiability Increases Trust:**
- 11 out of 252 (4.4%) participants generally do not trust information from unknown senders.
- 119 out of 377 (31.6%) respondents found the possibility of verification to be trust-promoting. This includes verifying the sender by calling the provided number and verifying the facts through personal research or with the help of experts or acquaintances.

### 6. Problem Solving and Support

#### 6.1 Problem Understanding and Resolution
We aimed to support site owners with our notification. We inquired about the helpfulness of the explanation in the notification and the self-service tool, as well as their willingness to receive future notifications.

- **Problem Understanding:** 339 out of 437 (77.6%) participants understood the problem of missing IP Anonymization from the notification.
- **Resolution Methods:**
  - 37.8% resolved the issue without help.
  - 30.9% asked their external service provider to resolve the problem.
  - 13.0% forwarded the issue to colleagues within the organization.
  - 10.8% resolved the problem after receiving help.
  - 7.5% used other methods (N = 362).

#### 6.2 Helpfulness of Self-Service Tool
The CheckGA tool was rated as (very) helpful by 87.2% of participants (266 out of 305). Another 51 respondents were unaware of the tool, and 86 had not used it.

#### 6.3 Future Notifications
- **Desire for Future Notifications:** 88.4% of owners (N = 448) wish to receive future notifications about privacy issues on their website.
- **Preferred Communication Channels:**
  - Email: 84.8%
  - Letter: 28.2%
  - Blog post: 3.7%
  - Call: 3.2%
  - Other (e.g., service portal): 1.7% (N = 401; multiple answers possible).
- **Willingness to Pay:** 30.5% of owners (N = 383) are willing to pay for such notifications.

### 7. Discussion

Our goal was to determine the factors influencing the success of a notification using both measurements and a survey of owners. In this section, we review the key results and highlight where the findings diverge. We then compare our results with prior work.

#### 7.1 Observed Behavior
- **High Remediation Rate:** 56.6% of notified operators remediated within two months, compared to 9.2% of the control group.
- **Time to Remediate:** Most owners became compliant within the first seven days, with a smaller number following over the next weeks.
- **Framing Effect:** The framing of the message, particularly mentioning legal requirements and potential fines, significantly increased the remediation rate.
- **Messenger Choice:** The UNI-LAW group achieved a higher remediation rate (59.7%) compared to the UNI-CS group (54%). The CITIZEN group had a similar rate (56.1%).
- **Cost of Letters:** Sending letters increased the remediation rate but at a high cost, especially for international notifications.
- **Reachability Challenges:** Despite careful data collection, some messages were undeliverable, suggesting poorly maintained websites.
- **Persistence Pays Off:** Reminders, particularly for the UNI-LAW – LETTER – GDPR+FINE group, increased the overall remediation rates.
- **Self-Service Tools:** Many site owners benefited from the CheckGA tool, which helped them understand and verify the problem.

#### 7.2 Survey of Owners
- **Trust Factors:** Minor aspects like the use of official letterheads and contact information were important in evaluating trust. Conversely, some factors reduced trust.
- **Distrust of Unsolicited Messages:** A significant number of recipients initially distrusted the message and contacted the sender to verify its authenticity.
- **Perception-Action Discrepancy:** There was a discrepancy between self-reported trust and actual remediation rates. Private individuals' messages, though less trusted, resulted in similar remediation rates.
- **Support in Remediation:** 204 owners (5.1%) requested support, and providing a remediation guide and verification tool was crucial.
- **Unawareness of Tracking:** 19.5% of respondents were unaware that Google Analytics (GA) was active on their website, and 36% of remediating owners removed GA instead of adding IP Anonymization.

#### 7.3 Comparison with Prior Work
- **Problem Awareness:** Our results align with previous studies, showing that awareness is necessary but not sufficient for remediation.
- **Bounce Rates:** Our observed bounce rates were lower than many previous studies, indicating the effectiveness of manual address collection.
- **Message Sender Effects:** Three prior studies also considered different senders, and our findings show that the sender's identity significantly influences the response.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the factors that influence the success of notifications and highlights the importance of trust, clear communication, and supportive tools in achieving compliance.
