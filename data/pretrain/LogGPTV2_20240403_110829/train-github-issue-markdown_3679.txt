I am using TypeScript in an Electron app and trying to use the `Chip`
component in `material-ui-next` and it does not recognize the `onDelete` prop,
but the API indicates it should.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I should not receive error
## Current Behavior
Receiving error: `TS2339: Property 'onDelete' does not exist on type
'IntrinsicAttributes & ChipProps & { children?: ReactNode; }'.`
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1.   2.   3.   4. 
## Context
Tying to use Chip component in `material-ui-next`
