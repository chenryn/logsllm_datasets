    It appears that go does not emit DWARF debugging information when building programs
    using cgo. (At least not on OS X / Darwin; haven't checked on another other OS.) Ideally
    debugging information would be present regardless of using cgo. And, if I could have a
    pony too, I'd love the DWARF information for the C-code as well.
    I've included two versions of a toy app (fizzbuzz), one which uses cgo and one which
    does not. When using `dwarfdump` to inspect the debugging info, the .debug_contents
    section of the Mach-O binary appear to be empty.
    go version prints "go version go1.3.3 darwin/amd64"
    Repro:
    # Verify debugging symbols are generated when not using cgo
    1. $ go build without_cgo.go
    2. $ dwarfdump without_cgo
    3. 
    # Verify debugging symbols NOT generated when using cgo
    1. $ go build with_cgo.go
    2. $dwarfdump with_cgo
    3. 
    Output:
