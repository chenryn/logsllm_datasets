The second component models the constraints imposed
by the detail of the security policy.
4.1. The State Transition Model
In the context of our working example, the state
transition model must include components that model
the protocols involved in establishing a SA, that is the
802.11, 802.1X and EAP state machines. An overview
of the expected exchanges used to establish an SA be-
tween an STA and an AP, along with the resulting state
transition diagram based on those exchanges, is shown
in Figure 1.
The state transition model is much less complex
than the contributing state machines. The reasons for
this are that the transition model only has to include
security relevant states that are passively observable.
A signiﬁcant number of internal, or security irrelevant
states do not need to be modelled and are unavailable
to a passive observer. A beneﬁcial side-eﬀect of this is
that only a limited amount of state must be maintained
by the passive monitor thereby reducing the resource
requirements of the monitor.
Figure 1 shows the expected incremental order in
which the legitimate STA and the AP should exchange
frames between each other during SA establishment
and the order in which their state transitions should oc-
cur. A legitimate STA is expected to transition through
state 0 through to state 9 in a strict sequence (see Fig-
ure 1) to establish a SA with an AP. Table 1 and Fig-
ure 1 show all the frames originating from the STA
or the AP that cause transitions in the state transi-
tion model and their target states. The states are ex-
pected to be traversed incrementally and last state of
the STA cannot be the same as its current state with
the exception of state 9. This is the state when the SA
is complete and the STA and the AP engage in data
communication.
4.2. Detecting State Transition Violations
All STA-AP associations should strictly transition
through the sequence of states speciﬁed by the state
transition model (see Figure 1). Any anomalous transi-
tions in the observed state transition model can be used
to detect violations of the model. There can be three
kinds of anomalous transition:
(a) a negative state
shift, which occurs when the STA transitions from a
higher state to a lower state; (b) a positive state shift,
which occurs when the STA bypasses an incremental
state; and (c) a zero state shift, which occurs when

state.
4.2.1 Negative Shifts
Negative state shifts occur when the STA, rather than
moving sequentially through states 0 to 9, transitions
to a state smaller than its last state. A negative shift is
usually a symptom of a DoS attack where management
or EAP frames are used to cause a negative state tran-
sition. Although all of these frames can be spoofed to
launch a denial-of-service attack, they do serve a legiti-
mate resource management function in WLANs. Hence
a negative shift does not necessarily imply a DoS at-
tack. To accommodate legitimate negative state shifts,
the sensor uses an index of suspicion for every STA.
This index is incremented for every observed negative
shift for that particular STA and when this index ex-
ceeds a threshold value, the sensor raises an alert to
that eﬀect. Hence the index of suspicion is used to
reduce the number of false positives and to ﬂag the
occurrence of excessive negative shifts as a likely DoS
condition.
4.2.2 Positive Shifts
Positive state shifts occur when the STA, rather than
moving sequentially through states 0 to 9, transitions
to a state greater than its last state by a value of more
than 1. Usually a positive shift is a consequence of
frame loss, but in the presence of a preceding nega-
tive shift, a positive shift in the STA’s state can be an
indication of a spooﬁng, session hijacking or man in
the middle (MITM) attack. Session hijacking attacks
usually consist of two steps: the adversary forces the
legitimate STA to disconnect from the network, usually
via a DoS attack; and then assumes the MAC address
of the victim STA to communicate with the network.
This attack will cause two shifts in the STA’s observed
state transition model: a negative shift when the DoS
attack is launched; and a positive shift when the adver-
sary sends data frames spooﬁng the legitimate STA’s
MAC address.
Frame loss is very common in IEEE 802.11 networks.
This might cause a positive shift in the observed state
transition model. For example, if the sensor does not
receive all transmissions, it may perceive a STA’s state
to be diﬀerent from the STA’s real state. To accommo-
date the eﬀects of frame loss, the sensor uses an index
of suspicion for keeping track of all positive state shifts
observed for a particular STA. If the number of pos-
itive shifts exceeds the predeﬁned index of suspicion
threshold for a particular STA, the sensor alerts this
condition as excessive frame loss.
4.2.3 Zero Shifts
Zero shifts occur when the STA’s current state and last
state are the same. In the state transition model (see
Figure 1), the STA is expected to enter only one state
repeatedly, namely state 9, after it has successfully es-
tablished security association. If a STA repeatedly re-
mains in a state other than 9, this could be indicative of
a misconﬁguration or a DoS ﬂooding attack. However,
a zero shift condition could also occur if the monitor
receives retransmissions of traﬃc to/from the STA. To
minimize the rate of false positives generated from this
condition, the sensor maintains an index of suspicion
where an alert is raised only when the number of zero
state shift events for a particular STA exceeds the pre-
determined threshold for zero state shifts.
4.3. Unexpected Frames
Table 1 and Figure 1 show all the frames that re-
sult in state transitions (in the state transition model)
and their target states. These frames can be classi-
ﬁed into two categories:
frames that lead to a +ve
(positive) transition and frames that cause a -ve (neg-
ative) state transition. Each frame has a target tran-
sition state that it would cause the sensor’s observed
state transition model to transition to. However, de-
pending on the classiﬁcation (+ve/-ve) of a frame and
the current state of the STA in the state transition
model, the frame might not lead to any transition in
the state transition model. We refer to such frames as
unexpected frames. Real world STAs and APs respond
only to certain frames in certain states. The unexpected
frames represent all frames that would be ignored by
the STA/AP in its current state.
The logic to determine if a frame is an unexpected
frame for the current state is now explained. For a
+ve frame, a transition is only processed if the current
state of the STA is smaller than or equal to the target
transition state for that frame. Similarly a -ve frame
leads to a state transition only if the current state of
the STA in the state transition model is greater than
or equal to the target transition state for that frame.
If an unexpected frame is detected, an alarm is raised.
4.4. Attack Classiﬁcation
When attacks are detected they are classiﬁed us-
ing the type-subtype of the last frame that caused the
alarm and examining the address ﬁelds of the frame.
For instance, if a Deauthentication Broadcast Flood is
launched, a zero state transition tolerance threshold
exceeded alarm is raised. This alarm indicates a ﬂood-
ing attack. The type-subtype of frames being injected

ﬁeld would be broadcast. This information is used
to classify the attack as a Deauthentication Broadcast
Flood attack. Also in order to classify unexpected frame
ﬂooding attacks, a counter is used which is incremented
for every unexpected frame received. When this counter
exceeds a pre-conﬁgured threshold, an alarm is raised
to indicate that an unexpected frame ﬂooding attack
was detected.
4.5. Security Policy Constraints
While the state transition model serves as a good
starting point for a detection system it must be fur-
ther reﬁned. In order to detect intrusive actions that
do not violate the state transition model but do vio-
late the security policy, additional constraints must be
incorporated into the speciﬁcation. These constraints
are derived from the network security policy require-
ments. In the case of our example, these constraints
are on the capabilities that the network should adver-
tise (via the robust security network information ele-
ment (RSN IE)), the supported encryption algorithms
and the required authentication method. In summary
these constraints are:
• RSN mode of operation: To monitor for com-
pliance with this constraint, the wireless sensor
will inspect the contents of the advertised AP ca-
pabilities contained in the RSN IE to verify that
required parameters are present and that prohib-
ited parameters are absent. The list of permitted
and prohibited modes of operation are provided to
the sensor via runtime conﬁguration directives.
• 802.1X: The use of port-based network access
control can be evaluated from the state transition
model. A network not supporting 802.1X, will not
enter states 5 and 6 of the state transition model
(as shown in Figure 1), but will move directly from
state 4 to state 9, which will result in an alert be-
