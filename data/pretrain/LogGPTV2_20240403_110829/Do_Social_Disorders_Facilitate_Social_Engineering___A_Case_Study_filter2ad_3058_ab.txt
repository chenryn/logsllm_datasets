fake website addresses by using URL obfuscation techniques, URL
shortening techniques, and insertion of IP address. For URL obfus-
cation, we replaced domain names with similar looking words. For
URL shortening, we shortened the URL with Google and Bitly link
shortener, and for the IP address technique, we replaced URL with
IP addresses. We then modified or removed the logo from some
websites to make them look distinctly fake. We also borrowed some
real-world phishing website addresses from www.phishtank.com.
We, however, could not directly use the websites from phishtank.com
in our study as the phishing websites relating to the brands we had
selected for our study were already taken down. The hypothesis
for the design was that the users may notice IP address and modified
logo in a website and identify them as the fake one, while they may
not notice the changes in website address and may fail to detect them.
The participants’ task in this study was to distinguish between
real and fake websites. The design of our phishing detection task is
in line with the ones previously employed in [13, 26]. We developed
an in-house software to execute the phishing detection task in
the Firefox browser (the study was limited to Firefox given its
popularity). The participants interacted with websites displayed
in the browser very much like a real-world environment. In order
to protect the privacy of the participants, while being subjected to
real-world phishing sites, we pre-downloaded these sites for offline
use and hosted them on our local web-server.
The fake websites (denoted “Fake”), which differ from the real
websites (denote “Real”) only in the URL are called “difficult fake
(DFake)”, assuming they might be difficult to detect. The other fake
websites, which differ from real websites in more than one factor,
such as layout, logo, fonts and URL, were referred to as “easy fake
(EFake)”, assuming these might be easier to detect. The Table 1
presents the sample of the URLs used in our study.
There were 60 randomized trials in this experiment: 30 each cor-
responding to real and fake websites. For fake websites, we had 15
each of easy fake and difficult fake websites. The experiment started
with the Firefox browser loading the instructions page (specifying
the tasks participants were to perform), which lasted for 60 seconds.
This was followed by the trials pages, each displayed for 16s. Each
trial consisted of a webpage (corresponding to a fake/real website)
shown for 6s, followed by a 10s long response page. The response

page had a dialog box with question: “Do you think the shown
website is real?” and the “Yes” and No” buttons. A break/rest page
of 2s (+ sign shown at the center of a blank page), after each trial
was added, during which participants were asked to relax. Also, we
extended the time of break to 6 seconds every 20 trials. The experi-
ment then ended after 60 trials with the goodbye note, displayed
for 5s. Figure 1 provides the flow diagram of the task we conducted.
4 STUDY PROTOCOL
In this section, we discuss the experimental protocol we imple-
mented for our study.
4.1 Ethical and Safety Considerations
The study was approved by our University’s IRB after a full
review given the study focused on people with disorders. The par-
ticipation in the study was strictly voluntary. The participants
were given the option to withdraw from the study at any point
of time. The standard best practices were followed to protect the
confidentiality and privacy of participants’ data (survey responses,
task responses) acquired during the study. No names and other
identifiable information were collected during the study.
4.2 Recruitment and Preparation Phase
The participants were recruited through a participant registry from
our laboratory and via advertisements across campus and on online
media. Interested participants contacted the research lab, and were
screened for eligibility by the IRB trained, research assistants. To be
eligible to participate, participants had to be 18 years or older and
use the Internet regularly. Also, the participants with autism had
an ASD diagnosis from a medical doctor or a clinical psychologist.
Once it was determined that an individual was eligible, they were
scheduled for an in-person study visit.
Fifteen participants with and without autism each were recruited
for the study. Each participant took about a total of 1 hour to com-
plete the study. During the preparation phase of the study, informed
consent was obtained from each participant. The participants then
provided their demographic information (such as age, gender, and
education level). Table 2 summarizes the demographic informa-
tion of our participants. Our pool for participants with autism was
comprised of 66.6% male and 33.3% female, 20% were above the
age of 30 and belonged to fairly diverse educational levels. Simi-
larly, the pool for the control participants, the participants without
autism, was comprised of 66.6% male and 33.3% female, 26% were
above the age of 30. Our sample, especially in terms of age, was
closer to the group of users who use the Internet frequently [7],
and who are supposedly more vulnerable to phishing attacks [30],
and hence are a good target of our study. Our participant sample
is also well-aligned with the samples used in related prior studies
[25, 26].
Also, in line with other prior studies [13, 25, 26], the participants
were not told anything regarding the security relevance of the
experiments, in order to avoid explicit security priming of the
individuals which may impact their task performance.

4.3 Data Collection Phase
After filling out the questionnaire surveying demographic infor-
mation, the participants completed the computer-usage-experience
questionnaire to assess their familiarity with computers and their
computer expertise, and the Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) to
assess the ASD symptom severity [10]. AQ is a standard paper-
and-pencil test comprising of 50 questions to measure the autistic
characteristics in users. The higher the score in AQ, the higher the
presence of symptoms consistent with autism.
The mean AQ score of participants with autism in our study
was 29.2 with the standard deviation of 2.2, and the mean AQ score
of the participants without autism was 17.06 with the standard
deviation of 3.63. The AQ is not a diagnosis for Autism, but a score
of 20 is considered as intermediate level of autism and a score
above 32 is considered higher symptomatic level of autism [10].
It took about 15 minutes for each of the participants to answer
ASQ. To recall, the participants we recruited for our study had ASD
diagnosis from a medical doctor or a clinical psychologist. After
completing these pen-and-paper questionnaires, participants were
briefed on the instruction to perform the phishing detection task.
The task required participants to identify a series of sample websites
as real or fake based on appearance. This task was completed in 20
minutes.
4.4 Post-Test Phase
After performing the task, the participants were given a post-test
questionnaire with questions designed to determine their familiar-
ity with the websites used in the experiment. The participants were
asked to answer if they were familiar with the websites presented
in the study and if they had an account with any of them. The
data collected from the post-test questionnaire was used to ana-
lyze the phishing detection accuracy for the websites on which the
participants had accounts in. The hypothesis was that the partici-
pants will have higher accuracy of phishing detection for familiar

websites. Also, in the post-test questionnaire, we had asked par-
ticipants about their concerns of security and privacy on the web,
web browsing behavior, knowledge of secure connection, computer
skills, knowledge and experience with spam and phishing, and the
strategies they used to identify the phishing websites. After the
completion of this phase, each participant was paid a $20 gift card
for their participation in the study.
5 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
To recall, in our experimental task, participants were shown real
and fake websites, and were asked to answer if the websites shown
to them were real (“yes” response) or fake (“no” response). We had
logged the participants responses and response times during the
experiment. A participant’s response was marked as correct if she
had marked yes for the real website, and no for the fake website. Oth-
erwise, the response was marked as incorrect. We then calculated
the accuracy with which participants correctly identified real, easy
fake and difficult fake websites. Accuracy is defined as the ratio of
the total number of correctly identified websites to the total num-
ber of websites presented to each participant for each category of
websites. We computed the average accuracy of correctly identified
real or fake websites, and average response time, first, for all the
websites, and second for only familiar websites.
We also performed statistical analysis to measure the statis-
tical significance of the results we achieved. First, we used the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to measure normalcy of the data. Our
data set was non-normal so we used the Friedman’s test and the
Wilcoxon Singed-Rank Test (WSRT) for measuring statistical dif-
ferences in the mean accuracy of real and fake websites within
a group and Mann-Whitney U Test for measuring the statistical
differences between the two groups (participants with autism and
without autism) underlying our analysis. We conducted the power
analysis of a Mann-Whitney U test to determine the power of our
sample size (N=15) using an alpha of 0.05, a large effect size (d = .8),
and two tails and observed the statistical power of 64%. This means
that our study had 64% chance of detecting the difference in perfor-
mance between participants with autism and without autism if a
difference is there to be detected. Holm-bonferroni correction was
used during post-hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. We also
used Spearman’s correlation coefficient (for non-normal distribu-
tion) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (for normal distribution)
to measure the correlation between the autism scores and the per-
formance accuracy.
5.1 Participants without Autism (Control)
In this section, we analyze the accuracy and response time we
measured during our study for the participants without the autism
spectrum disorder. This population serves as the control group for
our study.
5.1.1 Performance Analysis: All Websites. In this analysis, we con-
sidered all the websites (familiar and unfamiliar websites) presented
to the participants in the experiment. We then calculated the per-
centage accuracy of participants and the average response times
for the different types (real, easy fake and difficult fake) of websites.
Table 3 summarizes our results. The overall accuracy of correctly
identifying a website is around 77%. Even though the average ac-
curacy of easy fake websites looks higher than other the average
accuracy of other websites in Table 3, we did not observe statis-
tically significant difference in the mean accuracies and response
