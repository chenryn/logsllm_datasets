**ATT&CK ID:** T1588.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Tool Acquisition

Adversaries may acquire software tools through various means, such as purchasing, stealing, or downloading, for use in their malicious activities. These tools can be either open-source or proprietary, and may be available for free or require a commercial license. While these tools are not inherently designed for malicious purposes, they can be repurposed by adversaries to facilitate attacks. For example, PsExec, a legitimate administrative tool, can be used by attackers to execute commands on remote systems.

Tool acquisition can involve the procurement of commercial software licenses, including those for red teaming tools like Cobalt Strike. Adversaries may obtain commercial software through legitimate purchases, by stealing licenses or licensed copies of the software, or by cracking trial versions.
