User: How to implement a web application with multilingual support?
Assistant: There are several ways to implement multi-language supported Web applications: 1. Use multi-language libraries: use existing multi-language libraries (such as gettext, i18next, Globalize.js, etc.) to achieve multi-language support. 2. Front-end implementation: Set multiple language resource files in the front-end code, and you can switch languages without refreshing the page. 3. Server-side implementation: read different language files through the server-side code, fill in the corresponding language resources into the HTML code when generating the page, and return it to the client. 4. Use the browser language setting: automatically identify the user's language preference according to the language set by the browser, and return the corresponding language resource on the server side. 5. Use third-party platforms: use third-party platforms (such as Transifex, Crowdin, etc.) for multilingual translation, management and deployment.
