### Issue: `workbox-sw` Type Definition Error Due to Missing `BroadcastChannel` Declaration

**Description:**
The type definition for `workbox-sw` is causing an error because of a missing `BroadcastChannel` declaration. The problematic method signature is as follows:

```typescript
static broadCastUpdate(channel: BroadcastChannel, cacheName: string, url: string, source: string): void;
```

**Steps Taken:**
1. I attempted to use the `@types/xxxx` package but encountered issues.
2. I tried using the latest stable version of TypeScript (`tsc`). You can find the latest version [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript).
3. I have a question that is not suitable for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
