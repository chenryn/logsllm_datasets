make it fulfill the recovery objectives[28]. 
J.  User Guided Recovery for Cloud Web Service 
Applications 
The recovery strategies described in the above sections 
are all designed and implemented to recover from failures 
in an automatic way. However, for complex cloud systems 
it  is  difficult  to  always  employ  this  type  of  automation 
recovery, especially when the cloud systems are comprised 
of  large  number  of  different  components  across  different 
platforms  or  regions  or  even  different  clouds.  As  such, 
cloud users may be required to be involved in the recovery 
for  this  kind  of  cloud  applications[27].  In  [20],  a  user-
guided  recovery  framework  for  cloud  web  service 
applications  is  illustrated.  Specifically,  recovery  plans 
generation[20]  will  be  conducted 
  when  behavior 
correctness properties of an cloud web service application 
are violated at runtime. After obtaining generated recovery 
plans, those plans will be ranked and the user selects the 
best plan  for  execution. This recovery  strategy  is  used  at 
runtime  of  cloud  web  service  applications.  The  logic  is 
designed  during  the  design  phase  of  cloud  web  service 
applications. One challenge for this strategy is the efficient

C.  Recovery for Sporadic Activities in Design Phase 
IV.  DATA ANALYSIS & TAXONOMY 
Fig.  3  shows  the  four  categories  we  are  using.  Cloud 
applications have normal activities and sporadic activities. 
Both normal and sporadic activities have design phase and 
runtime  phase.  Normal  activities  for  cloud  applications 
include  applications  workflow  and  internal processes  and 
execution 
flow  within  certain  system  architecture. 
Sporadic  activities 
include 
deployment, upgrade, reconfiguration, migration, etc. Our 
4  categories  for  the  classification  of  cloud  recovery 
strategies are: 1) Recovery for Normal Activities in Design 
Phase;  2)  Recovery  for  Normal  Activities  in  Runtime 
Phase;  3)  Recovery  for  Sporadic  Activities  in  Design 
Phase;  4)  Recovery  for  Sporadic  Activities  in  Runtime 
Phase.  
for  cloud  applications 
Fig. 3. Cloud Activities and Time Phases 
A.  Recovery for Normal Activities in Design Phase 
Normal activities involve two levels: application level 
which  means  the  aspects  related  to  cloud  applications 
execution  (e.g.  the  execution  of  the  program  within  a 
component  of  cloud  system),  and  infrastructure  level 
which  means  the  aspects  related  to  cloud  datacenter 
components  structure.  In  the  existing  recovery  strategies, 
fault-tolerance  design,  virtual  machine  replication  design, 
recovery  design  for  cloud  internal  protocols  and  user 
guided recovery design can be implemented in the design 
phase of application level cloud normal activities. Hence, 
these  four  recovery  strategies  are  included  into  the 
recovery  strategies  for  application  level  normal  activities 
in design phase. Also, virtual machine replication design, 
disaster  recovery  design  as  well  as  fault-tolerance  design 
can be  implemented  in  the design  phase of  infrastructure 
level cloud normal activities. Hence, they are included into 
the  recovery  strategies  for  infrastructure  level  normal 
activities in design phase. 
B.  Recovery for Normal Activities in Runtime Phase 
In all the existing recovery strategies, cloud application 
rollback,  fault-tolerance,  virtual  machine  replication, 
recovery  for  cloud  internal  protocols  and  user  guided 
recovery for cloud web service applications take effect in 
the  runtime  phase  of  application  level  cloud  normal 
activities.  Hence,  they  are  included  into  the  recovery 
strategies for application level normal activities in runtime 
phase. Also, virtual machine replication, disaster recovery 
and  fault-tolerance  take  effect  in  the  runtime  phase  of 
infrastructure level cloud normal activities. Hence, they are 
included into the recovery strategies for infrastructure level 
normal activities in runtime phase. 
the  sporadic  operations  on 
Sporadic activities also involve two levels: application 
level  which  means 
the 
applications inside virtual machines (e.g. installing Tomcat 
in  a  machine),  and  infrastructure  level  which  means  the 
sporadic  operations  on  the  infrastructure  of  cloud  (e.g. 
upgrade a machine by using new AMI). In all the existing 
recovery strategies, test driven scripts can be prepared and 
conducted  under  test  bed  during  the  design  phase  of 
application  level  sporadic  activities.  And  script  exception 
handling  design,  recovery  design  for  operations  as 
transactions  and  recovery  design  for  cloud  operations  as 
processes  can  be  implemented  in  the  design  phase  of 
application  level  sporadic  activities.  Hence,  these  four 
recovery strategies are included into the recovery strategies 
for  application  level  sporadic  activities  in  design  phase. 
Also,  cloud  operation  exceptions  handling  design, 
recovery  design  for  cloud  operations  as  transactions  and 
recovery  design  for cloud  operations  as processes  can  be 
implemented  in  the  design  phase  of  infrastructure  level 
sporadic  activities.  Hence,  they  are  included  into  the 
recovery  strategies  for 
level  sporadic 
activities in design phase. 
infrastructure 
D.  Recovery for Sporadic Activities in Runtime Phase 
In  all  the  existing  recovery  strategies,  recovery  for 
cloud  operations  as  transactions,  recovery  for  cloud 
operations  as processes and  script exception  handling are 
implemented  in  the  runtime  phase  of  application  level 
sporadic  activities.  Hence,  these  three  recovery  strategies 
are  included  into  the  recovery  strategies  for  application 
level  sporadic  activities  in  runtime  phase.  Also,  cloud 
for  cloud 
operation  exceptions  handling, 
operations  as 
transactions  and 
for  cloud 
operations  as  processes  are  implemented  in  the  runtime 
phase  of  infrastructure  level  sporadic  activities.  Hence, 
they  are 
the  recovery  strategies  for 
infrastructure level sporadic activities in runtime phase.

Based on the above data analysis, we can classify the 
existing cloud recovery strategies into six groups as show 
in  Fig.  4.  Since  in  this  diagram  the  normal  activities  are 
divided  into  application level  and  infrastructure  level,  we 
would  like  to  call  this  diagram  level  1  classification 
diagram.

Then, by combining application level and infrastructure 
level  in  both  normal  activities  and  sporadic  activities  for 
both  design  phase  and  runtime  phase,  we  get  the  level  2 
classification as shown in below Fig. 5. And this serves as 
the final taxonomy for cloud recovery strategies.

V.  DISCUSSION 
Our taxonomy for existing cloud recovery strategies is 
based  on  different  cloud  application  activities  (normal 
activities  and  sporadic  activities)  in  different  life  cycle 
phases (design phase and runtime  phase).  Some recovery 
mechanisms are dedicated for operation simulation phases 
and we treat this as the design phase of operations.  This 
taxonomy of cloud recovery strategies provides guidelines 
for  literature  reviews  of  cloud  recovery  mechanisms. 
Moreover,  our 
research  summarizes  existing  cloud 
recovery strategies and provides explanation of the scopes 
and contexts of existing cloud recovery methods. 
VI.  CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 
Recovery  for  sporadic  operations  on  clouds 
is 
complicated because it needs to include both the recovery 
for  sporadic  activities  and  the  recovery  for  normal 
activities. This paper presents  a taxonomy  for classifying 
existing  cloud  recovery  strategies  ranging  from  recovery 
mechanisms  for  cloud  applications  normal  activities  to 
recovery  mechanisms  for  cloud  applications  sporadic 
activities. This taxonomy is obtained by analyzing existing 
cloud  recovery  strategies  and  classifying  them  into  four 
groups.  This  taxonomy  provides  a  view  on  the  purposes 
and scopes of the current existing cloud recovery strategies 
and  it  facilities  the  research  on  recoverability  of  cloud 
sporadic  operations.  Our  future  work  includes  proposing 
non-intrusive  recovery  mechanisms  for  cloud  sporadic 
operations with the guidance of this taxonomy.
