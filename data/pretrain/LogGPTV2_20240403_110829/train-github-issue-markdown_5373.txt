If you add `inf, -inf` into the list
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/test/test_torch.py#L9274 it'll
fail the test.
So from numpy doc, `inf` norm is defined as `max(sum(abs(x), axis=1))` for
matrix and `max(abs(x))` for vector, but it seems we always implemented
`max(abs(x))`.
short repro:
    In [1]: import torch
    In [2]: import numpy as np
    In [3]: a = torch.rand(3, 3)
    In [4]: b = a.numpy()
    In [5]: import math
    In [6]: torch.norm(a, math.inf)
    Out[6]: tensor(0.7553)
    In [7]: np.linalg.norm(b, math.inf)
    Out[7]: 1.4294269
