**Abstract**

Website defacements and vandalism can significantly harm website owners through the loss of sales, reputation, and legal ramifications. Previous work on detecting website defacements has focused on unauthorized changes to the web server, such as host-based intrusion detection systems or file-based integrity checks. However, these approaches often fail to detect modern defacement techniques, such as code and data injection attacks and DNS hijacking, because these attacks do not modify the website's code or configuration but instead introduce new content or redirect users to different websites.

In this paper, we present MEERKAT, a novel defacement detection system that uses computer vision techniques to recognize defaced websites, similar to how a human analyst would visually inspect a website. MEERKAT requires no prior knowledge of the website's content or structure, only its URL. Upon detecting a defacement, MEERKAT notifies the website operator, who can then take appropriate action. MEERKAT automatically learns high-level features from screenshots of defaced and legitimate websites using recent advances in machine learning, such as stacked autoencoders and deep neural networks, combined with computer vision techniques. These features are used to create models that can detect newly defaced websites.

We evaluate MEERKAT on the largest website defacement dataset to date, comprising 10,053,772 defacements observed between January 1998 and May 2014, and 2,554,905 legitimate websites. MEERKAT achieves true positive rates between 97.422% and 98.816%, false positive rates between 0.547% and 1.528%, and Bayesian detection rates between 98.583% and 99.845%, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

**1. Introduction**

Website defacements and vandalism can cause significant harm to website owners by disrupting operations, tarnishing reputations, and leading to legal consequences. In a website defacement, an attacker replaces the legitimate content with their own, often for reasons such as gaining notoriety, making political or religious statements, or simply for "bragging rights." For example, in November 2014, attackers defaced the Keighley Cougars rugby club's website, displaying a message in support of the terrorist organization ISIL/ISIS. Similarly, in late 2012, the homepage of the Al Jazeera news network was defaced with a message accusing the network of spreading false news.

Detecting such defacements is challenging because attackers can use various methods, including code and data injection, and DNS hijacking, which do not directly alter the website's code or configuration. In this paper, we introduce MEERKAT, a system that automatically detects website defacements by rendering the website in a browser and analyzing the visual representation. MEERKAT learns high-level features from screenshots of both defaced and legitimate websites, using machine learning and computer vision techniques. If a defacement is detected, the system notifies the website operator, who can then take corrective action.

**2. Motivation**

Despite the increasing prevalence of website defacements, the scientific community has given limited attention to this issue. The number of reported defacements has been consistently higher than the number of reported phishing pages since October 2006, with up to 33.39 defacements reported for every phishing page. According to the Malaysian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), 26.04% of all reported incidents in 2013 were website defacements, compared to only 1.5% in 2003. Additionally, over 53,000 high-profile websites ranked in Alexa's, MajesticSEO's, and QuantCast's top 1 million lists were defaced in 2014, indicating that even well-protected sites are at risk.

The resurgence in defacements is attributed to the rise of hacktivist groups like Anonymous and LulzSec, as well as geopolitical conflicts. Although the attacks themselves are often primitive, they have been highly effective. For instance, in February 2015, Google Vietnam was defaced by Lizard Squad, and in January 2015, the Malaysia Airlines website was defaced by Cyber Caliphate. These incidents highlight the need for an accurate and lightweight monitoring system to detect and respond to website defacements.

**3. MEERKAT System Overview**

MEERKAT is a website defacement detection system that leverages computer vision and machine learning to identify defaced websites. The system works by:

- **Rendering the Website:** MEERKAT renders the website in a browser, just as a normal user would.
- **Feature Learning:** It learns high-level features from the visual representation of the website using stacked autoencoders and deep neural networks.
- **Model Creation:** Based on the learned features, MEERKAT creates a model to differentiate between defaced and legitimate websites.
- **Detection and Notification:** If a defacement is detected, MEERKAT notifies the website operator, who can then take appropriate action.

**4. Evaluation**

We evaluated MEERKAT on a large dataset of 10,053,772 defacements and 2,554,905 legitimate websites. MEERKAT achieved true positive rates between 97.422% and 98.816%, false positive rates between 0.547% and 1.528%, and Bayesian detection rates between 98.583% and 99.845%. These results demonstrate that MEERKAT significantly outperforms existing approaches in detecting website defacements.

**5. Limitations and Future Work**

While MEERKAT shows promising results, there are limitations to consider. The system's performance may be affected by the quality and diversity of the training data. Additionally, MEERKAT currently relies on visual analysis, which may not capture all types of defacements. Future work will focus on enhancing the system's robustness and expanding its capabilities to detect more subtle forms of defacement.

**6. Related Work**

Previous work on website defacement detection has primarily focused on detecting unauthorized changes to the web server. These approaches, while effective in some cases, often fail to detect modern defacement techniques. MEERKAT addresses these limitations by using computer vision and machine learning to analyze the visual representation of websites, providing a more comprehensive and accurate detection method.

**7. Conclusion**

MEERKAT is a novel and effective system for detecting website defacements. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, MEERKAT can accurately identify defaced websites and notify operators, allowing for timely corrective action. Our evaluation on a large dataset demonstrates MEERKAT's superior performance compared to existing approaches, making it a valuable tool for protecting websites from defacement.
