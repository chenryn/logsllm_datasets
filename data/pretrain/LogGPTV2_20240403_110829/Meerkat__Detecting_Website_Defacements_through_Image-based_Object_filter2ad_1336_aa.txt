Introduction
Website defacements and website vandalism can inﬂict sig-
niﬁcant harm on the website owner through the loss of sales,
the loss in reputation, or because of legal ramiﬁcations.
Prior work on website defacements detection focused on
detecting unauthorized changes to the web server, e.g., via
host-based intrusion detection systems or ﬁle-based integrity
checks. However, most prior approaches lack the capabili-
ties to detect the most prevailing defacement techniques used
today: code and/or data injection attacks, and DNS hijack-
ing. This is because these attacks do not actually modify the
code or conﬁguration of the website, but instead they intro-
duce new content or redirect the user to a different website.
In this paper, we approach the problem of defacement
detection from a different angle: we use computer vision
techniques to recognize if a website was defaced, similarly
to how a human analyst decides if a website was defaced
when viewing it in a web browser. We introduce MEERKAT,
a defacement detection system that requires no prior
knowledge about the website’s content or its structure, but
only its URL. Upon detection of a defacement, the system
notiﬁes the website operator that his website is defaced, who
can then take appropriate action. To detect defacements,
MEERKAT automatically learns high-level features from
screenshots of defaced websites by combining recent
advances in machine learning, like stacked autoencoders
and deep neural networks, with techniques from computer
vision. These features are then used to create models that
allow for the detection of newly-defaced websites.
We show the practicality of MEERKAT on the largest web-
site defacement dataset to date, comprising of 10,053,772
defacements observed between January 1998 and May 2014,
and 2,554,905 legitimate websites. Overall, MEERKAT
achieves true positive rates between 97.422% and 98.816%,
false positive rates between 0.547% and 1.528%, and
Bayesian detection rates1 between 98.583% and 99.845%,
thus signiﬁcantly outperforming existing approaches.
1The Bayesian detection rate is the likelihood that if we detect a
website as defaced, it actually is defaced, i.e., P(true positive|positive).
The defacement and vandalism of websites is an attack
that disrupts the operation of companies and organizations,
tarnishes their brand, and plagues websites of all sizes,
from those of large corporations to the websites of single
individuals [1–3].
In a website defacement, an attacker replaces the content
of a legitimate website with some of his/her own content. A
website might be defaced for many different reasons and in
many different ways: For example, an attacker might deface
the website by brute-forcing the administrator’s credentials,
by leveraging a SQL injection to introduce content or code,
or by hijacking the domain name; however, all defaced
websites share one characteristic:
the defacer leaves a
message that is shown to the visitors of the website instead
of the legitimate content, changing the visual appearance
of the website.
Although nearly all defacers vandalize websites for their
“15 minutes of fame,” and to get a platform to publicize
their message, their messages vary: some embarrass the
website’s operator, others make a political or religious point,
and others again do it simply for “bragging rights.” For
instance, in the beginning of November 2014, as reported
by the BBC [4], attackers defaced the website of the
Keighley Cougars, a professional rugby club from England
competing in League 1. The defacers modiﬁed the website
so that visitors were greeted with a message in support
of the terrorist organization “Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant/Syria” (ISIL/ISIS). Similarly, in late 2012, defacers
close to the Syrian regime defaced the homepage of the
prominent Qatari television network Al Jazeera, and instead
of being shown news articles, visitors were greeted by a
message alleging Al Jazeera of “spreading false fabricated
news.” Reliably detecting such website defacements is
challenging, as there are many ways in which an attacker
can tamper with the website’s appearance, including
re-routing the trafﬁc to a different website, which does not
affect the legitimate website’s content directly in any way.
In this paper, we introduce MEERKAT, a website
monitoring system that automatically detects if a website
has been defaced. MEERKAT detects website defacements
by rendering the website in a browser, like a normal visitor

would, and deciding, based on features learned exclusively
from screenshots of defacements and legitimate websites
observed in the past, if the website’s look and feel is that of
a defaced or a legitimate website. If the website is detected
as being defaced, the system notiﬁes the operator, who,
in turn, can, depending on the conﬁdence in MEERKAT’s
decision, put the website (automatically) in maintenance
mode or restore a known good state to reduce the damage.
Our technical contributions in this paper are:
O We introduce MEERKAT, a website defacement
detection system that learns a high-level feature set from
the visual representation of the website, i.e., it learns
a compressed representation of the look and feel of
website defacements and legitimate websites. Based on
the learned features, the system then produces a model
to differentiate between defaced and legitimate websites,
which it uses to detect website defacements in the wild.
In addition, the system notiﬁes the website’s operator
upon detection (Section 3).
O We evaluate MEERKAT on the largest website deface-
ment dataset to date, comprising of 10,053,772 website
defacements observed between January 1998 to May
2014, and 2,554,905 legitimate and (supposedly) not
defaced websites from Alexa’s, MajesticSEO’s, and
QuantCast’s top 1 million lists (Section 4).
In the remainder of this paper, we make a compelling case
for the need of an accurate and lightweight website mon-
itoring system that detects website defacements (Section 2),
discuss how MEERKAT works in detail (Section 3), evaluate
our system on the largest defacement dataset to date
(Section 4), discuss some limitations of website defacement
detection systems (Section 5), compare MEERKAT to related
work (Section 6), and, ﬁnally, we conclude (Section 7).
2 Motivation
Lately, the detection of website defacements as a research
topic has not received much attention from the scientiﬁc
community, while, at the same time, defacements became
more prominent than they have ever been. The number of
reported defacements has been exceeding the number of
reported phishing pages since October 2006 by a factor of
7 on average, and reached up to 33.39 defacements being re-
ported to Zone-H2 per phishing page reported to PhishTank3
(see Figure 2). Yet, website vandalism is often played down
as a problem instead of being acknowledged and addressed.
The increase in defacements is evident (see Figure 2):
while a mere 783 veriﬁed defacements were reported
on average each day to Zone-H in 2003, the number of
reports increased to 3,258 veriﬁed defacements per day
for the year 2012, to an all-time high of over 4,785 veriﬁed
defacements being reported each day to Zone-H in 2014.
This corresponds to an increase of websites being defaced
by 46.87% from 2012 to 2014 [5].
Similarly, according to the Malaysian Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT), 26.04% of all reported
incidents in 2013 were website defacements, but only 1.5%
of the reported incidents were defacements in 2003, and
10.81% were website defacements in 2007 [7, 8].
Furthermore, in 2014, attackers conﬁrmedly defaced over
53,000 websites ranked on Alexa’s, MajesticSEO’s, and
QuantCast’s top 1 million lists. Corroborating that not only
websites that are “low-hanging fruit” are being defaced, but
that high-proﬁle ones are being attacked alike (see Table 1).
This recent resurgence and the increase in defacements
and “cyber-vandalism” is generally attributed to the rise of
hacktivist groups, like anonymous or LulzSec [9, 10], but
also gained traction through the escalation of international
conﬂicts [11, 12]. Although the scientiﬁc consensus is
that the attacks employed to deface a website are usually
rather primitive in nature [9], hacktivist groups and other
politically- and religiously-motivated defacers have been
extremely successful in the past: in February 2015, Google
Vietnam was defaced by Lizard Squad for several hours [13];
in January 2015, the website of Malaysia Airlines was de-
faced by Cyber Caliphate [3]; in late 2014, the defacer group
Team System Dz defaced over 1,700 websites to speak out
against the actions of the US in the Syrian civil war and to ad-
vocate for ISIS/ISIL [2]; in April 2014, over 100 websites be-
2Zone-H [5] is an archive containing only defaced websites, all
reported defacements are mirrored locally and manually veriﬁed [6]. Upon
manual inspection, a reported defacement is removed from the archive
if it does not constitute a defacement, or it is marked as veriﬁed.
3PhishTank is the largest public clearinghouse of data about phishing
scams, users report potential phishing scams and other users agree or
disagree with the submitter, resulting in a user-assigned phishing score.
Phishing pages are not being veriﬁed by expert analysts.
