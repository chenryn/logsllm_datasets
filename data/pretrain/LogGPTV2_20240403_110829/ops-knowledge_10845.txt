User: I have a couple versions of python on my box. My app uses python 2.7 which is found in /usr/local/bin/python. Apache seems to be using an earlier version in /usr/bin/python. How can I configure Apache to use a later version of Python for my app?
Assistant: To use with Python 3, you need to install the right mod_wsgi for python 3.
On Debian or Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3.
For older versions of Python, when installing mod_wsgi, type : ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python2.5 for version 2.5 for instance.
