User: I want to be able to execute openssh with some custom arguments and then be able to automatically login to the server. I  want that my script will enter the password if needed and inject 'yes' if I'm prompted to add the fingerprint to the known hosts.
I've found SharpSsh for C# that do that, but I also need to use -D parameter and use ProxyCommand that I define in SSH, and the library is quite lacking for that usage.
Another thing that I've found  was pexcept for Python that should do the trick but I couldn't find where to download it, on the offical page I'm being redirectred from sourceforge to some broken link.
Any help would be appreciated,
Bill.
Assistant: pexpect can't import on Windows. So, I use plink.exe with a Python subprocess to connect to the ssh server.
