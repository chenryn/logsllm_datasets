User: I just finished my second year as a university CS student, so my "real-world" knowledge is lacking.  I learned Java my first year, continued with Java and picked up C and simple Bash 
scripting my second.  This summer I'm trying to learn Perl (God help me).  I've dabbled with Python a bit in the past.
My question is, now that we have very readable, very writable scripting languages like Python, Ruby, Perl, etc, why does anyone write Bash scripts?  Is there something I'm missing?  I know my linux box has perl and python.  Are they not ubiquitous enough?  Is there really something
that's easier to do in Bash than in some other hll?
Assistant: Easier, probably not.  I actually prefer perl to bash scripting in many cases.  Bash does have one advantage, though, especially on Linux systems: it's all but guaranteed to be installed.  And if it's not, its largely-compatible father (sh) will be, cause almost all system scripts are written for sh.  Even perl isn't that ubiquitous, and it's everyfreakingwhere.
