User: It is necessary to provide a detailed network design scheme for the existing network topology, and it is recommended to cover all network devices and various network protocols.
Assistant: First of all, we need to fully understand the current network topology and equipment conditions, including the types, versions, and configurations of various equipment, so as to provide effective reference for the next design. Aiming at the current network topology, we propose the following network design scheme: 1. Network deployment and topology design design: a three-layer core-convergence-access network topology is adopted, and the equipment includes routers, switches, etc. Configure accelerators, firewalls and other network security devices in the corresponding locations. As required, virtualization technology can be used to deploy different core networks in different virtual machines to improve system flexibility and fault tolerance. 2. Network protocol selection design scheme: adopt mainstream network protocols, such as VLAN, OSPF, BGP, ISIS, MPLS, VPN, etc., and network devices that support IPv4/IPv6 protocol family to ensure the scalability and flexibility of the network scale , stability and security. 3. Network equipment selection and design scheme: according to the needs of the network topology, select high-performance and scalable routers, switches and other equipment, such as Cisco, Huawei, etc., and at the same time, the maintainability and compatibility of equipment need to be considered factors for better user experience and application performance. 4. Network security scheme design scheme: Adopt a security scheme based on policy supervision, including network firewall, encrypted transmission, access control and other security mechanisms to ensure the reliability and security of data transmission. In addition, technologies such as DDoS protection can also be added to deal with intrusion and attack events. To sum up, the network design scheme needs to comprehensively consider factors such as network deployment and topology design, network protocol selection, network equipment selection, and network security solutions, so as to improve the reliability, stability, security, and performance of the network. In practical applications, it is also necessary to adjust and optimize various scenarios and application requirements to provide the best network solution.
