User: I installed python 3.5.2 on Windows 8.1, I executed the python-3.5.2-amd64.exe installer.
Nothing bad happened.
I was searching the Python35 folder in C:\ , but actually is in C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35
I opened python.exe and I got an error: api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing.
How can I make it works?
I already have installed Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x64) - 11.0.50727 and so on.
Thank you in advance.
Assistant: I faced the same problem, and I did find the missing files in a directory under C:\windows\WinSxS, just do a lookup for the required file and then paste all the files in that directory in C:\Windows\System32. That solved the problem for me.
