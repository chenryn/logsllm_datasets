I'm observing the following behaviour with `workspace()` on julia v0.3.0+6 on
Ubuntu 14.04
    julia> eval(parse("1+1"))
    2
    julia> workspace()
    julia> eval(parse("1+1"))
    ERROR: eval not defined
I opened a thread on julia-users and was advised the behaviour was probably a
bug and to report it here.
