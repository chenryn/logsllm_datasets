7 RELATED WORK
In this section, we first discuss the existing efforts on formally
analyzing cellular networks and other security protocols and then
compare our findings with the known threats (with respect to
security, privacy, and availability) on cellular networks.
Formal Verification of Cellular Networks. Two previous ef-
forts [14, 22] that formally analyzed the 5G protocol focus only on
the AKA part of the initial registration procedure. As opposed to
formal verification, Kim et al. [35] design a stateless dynamic testing
framework for 4G RRC and NAS layers. Our proposed framework,
on the other hand, combines MCheck and CPVerif to formally ana-
lyze multiple stateful procedures spanning across 5G NAS and RRC
layers using enhanced modeling abstractions.
Formal Verification of Other Security Protocols. Bhargavan
et al. [25] and Fett et al. [26] develop formal analysis frameworks
for TLS 1.3 [25] and OAuth [26]. These approaches, however, either
use implementation specific modeling abstractions (e.g., for TLS
1.3 [25]) and proofs, or computational models [26]. It is, therefore,
not clear how to apply them to cellular networks.
Linkabillity and Traceability Attacks. Previous work uncover
the mapping/linking from TMSI to IMSI [11] and from C-RNTI to
TMSI [31, 45] in 3G and 4G networks. Other studies [12, 33, 48]
devise the mapping from a user’s phone number to TMSI when the
network operator does not change the TMSI frequently or randomly
enough. Kohls et al. [36] exploit layer two information to launch
website fingerprinting whereas Shaik et al. [47] demonstrate device
fingerprinting using exposed device capabilities. Our exposing de-
vice’s TMSI, I-RNTI and paging occasion attack, on the other hand,
is different since it leverages cross-layer interactions.
IMSI Catching. IMSI catching attacks [9, 17, 23, 32, 41] have been
an issue since 2G networks. Hussain et al. [29] recently demonstrate
a brute-force IMSI-Cracking attack to retrieve a target UE’s SUPI in
5G. Our installing null cipher and null integrity attack, on the other
hand, does not employ any brute-force technique, but exploits the
Session 3D: Formal Analysis ICCS ’19, November 11–15, 2019, London, United Kingdom682unprotected rrc_sec_mode_failure to retrieve the SUPI when the UE
is in limited service mode.
Main-in-the-Middle Relay. Rupprecht et al. [44] and Chlosta et
al. [20] devise a MitM and an impersonation attack by exploiting
implementation bugs in an LTE dongle and operational networks,
respectively. Rupprecht et al. [45] also show how a MitM relay
can be leveraged to manipulate the encrypted payload and redirect
DNS traffic. Our counter reset attack has a MitM flavor, however,
it is different since it exploits vulnerabilities in the processing of
counter values used for generating/verifying the MAC.
Denial-of-Service. In [40, 42, 43, 46, 48], the authors explore ways
to conduct DoS attacks against 3G and 4G subscribers. Kim et al. [35]
show several new DoS attacks against both specific users and entire
base stations exploiting the vulnerabilities of 4G networks. Our
DoS attacks using rrc_setup_request, rrc_resume_request, reg_request,
and ue_dereg_request messages, however, uncover a different class of
vulnerabilities in the initial messages of both NAS and RRC layers
of 5G protocol stack.
8 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS
(1) Experimentation in testbed. We currently do not have access
to any 5G commercial networks or cellular devices. In addition,
there is no open-source 5G protocol stack which prevents us from
testing our attacks in a testbed.
(2) Defenses. We do no provide any defenses since it is unclear how
to add defenses without altering the protocol. Further investigation
is needed for designing defenses and hence is left for future work.
(3) Threat to validity. The manually extracted FSMs from the
3GPP standard are our faithful interpretation; inaccuracies in which
may induce false positives. Since commercial and open-source 5G
testbed networks not available yet, we could not verify the attacks.
(4) Responsible disclosure. We reported our findings to GSMA
through the CVD program [8] and are waiting for their response.
9 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We presented the 5GReasoner framework which can formally rea-
son about desired properties of the 5G control-plane-protocols pos-
sibly spanning across multiple layers of the stack. Due to the careful
use of behavior-specific abstraction, our 5G model—covering 6 NAS
and 5 RRC layer control-plane-protocols—is amenable to the highly
automated analysis of 5GReasoner. Our evaluation of 5GReasoner
with respect to desired properties obtained from the specification
revealed 11 new 5G design weaknesses. We also observed that the
5G protocol model also inherits 5 design weaknesses from the 4G
LTE protocol. We also show how to take advantage of our findings
to devise exploitable attacks against the current version of 5G.
Future work. In the future, we will improve our 5G protocol model
to include other key control-layer protocols. To make the 5G model
amenable to automated reasoning, we may require to explore dif-
ferent new forms of abstraction which achieves a right balance
between behavioral accuracy and analysis scalability.
