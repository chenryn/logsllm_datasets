In clases like .hidden-phone, etc...
We should not use display:inherit in those clases. Inherit will cause the
element to be displayed the same way than its parent.
Example of this problem:
         Don't like phones 
         Show me anywhere 
The first link, instead of being displayed inline, like a "normal link" will
get display box from its parent. This will cause the second link to go below,
instead of being on the same line.
I can send a pull request but I'd like some confirmation about this problem
before doing anything.
