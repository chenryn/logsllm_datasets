ABSTRACT
Making data the ﬁrst class entity, Information-Centric Net-
working (ICN) replaces conventional host-to-host model with
content sharing model. However, the huge amount of con-
tent and the volatility of replicas cached across the Inter-
net pose signiﬁcant challenges for addressing content only
by name. In this paper, we propose a topology-aware name-
based routing protocol which combines the beneﬁts of location-
oriented routing and content-centric routing together. We
adopt a URL-like naming scheme, which deﬁnes register lo-
cations and content identiﬁer. Node with copies sends Regis-
ter messages towards a register using location-oriented rout-
ing protocols. All en-path routers record forwarding entries
in forwarding table (FIB) as the ”bread crumb” to this con-
tent. Following the bread crumb, routers know the ”best”
topology path to the available copies. An Interest is either
forwarded towards a ”known” copy by the content identiﬁer,
or towards the register nodes where it would ﬁnd the bread
crumb to the ”best” copies. Compared with the existing
ﬂooding or name resolution methods, Our design shows a
good potential in terms of scalability, availability and over-
head.

INTRODUCTION
Information-Centric Networking [1], also named Content-
Centric Networking (CCN), is emerging as promising clean-
slate Internet design in recent years.
It takes content as
primitive, and retrieves content by name, not by host IP

again. It is able to decouple location from identity, and re-
place widely used host-to-host conversation model with con-
tent sharing communication model [3]. However, the huge
amount of content and the volatility of replicas cached across
the Internet pose signiﬁcant challenges for addressing con-
tent only by name. It is still an open issue for ICN how to
retrieve a copy of content from the ”best” available sources.
An ideal name-based routing protocol is able to address
all permanent and temporary caching copies, and ﬁnd the
”best” available replica (e.g. closest in topology). There are
three main challenges for this objective.
1. Scalability. According to the current size of web, the
number of content object is huge, and rapidly growing.
The scheme of centralized name resolution or query
ﬂooding are not suitable for a large scale internet.
2. Availability. Copies are stored in networks anywhere.
ICN should at least ﬁnd one copy even nodes are mov-
ing. If there are many copies, it should know the topol-
ogy and forward the request to the closed one.
3. Low overhead. It is necessary for ICN to maintain
routing FIB with low overhead, especially for a Inter-
net scale network.
Prior works can be classiﬁed into two categories: name
ﬂooding and name resolution. CCN [3] employs a human-
readable hierarchical naming scheme in order to aggregate
name preﬁx. But the topology is static. It is hard to ag-
gregate routing entries in case of there are many copies in
di↵erent locations. It also employs a ﬂooding method to an-
nounce content name, which is not suitable for large scale
networks. Other pioneering name resolution schemes have
also been proposed, such as TARID[2], DONA[4], NetInf [1],
etc. They employ centralized or distributed indexing infras-
tructure to map content name to appropriate locations. But
the overhead to maintain the index is very high.
In this paper, we propose a topology-aware name-based
routing protocol to combine the beneﬁts of location-oriented
routing and content-centric routing. Packets are forwarded
by content identiﬁer while FIB entries are built by topology-
based routing protocols. We employ a URL-like naming
scheme which deﬁnes register location and content identiﬁer.
All routers also acts as registers which form a distributed
registration system. A source selects a nearby router as reg-
ister node whose location is embedded in the published URL-
like name. We also introduce a Topology Routing Table
(TRT) into name-based routing to describe network topol-
ogy. When an Interest message arrives, router ﬁrst lookups

it forwards the message toward content providers.
If no
matching entry, it lookups TRT and forwards it to the reg-
ister node indicated in the URL-like name. Any node with a
copy would send a Register message toward the register by
location-oriented routing protocols. And all en-path routers
will record forwarding entries in FIB as ”bread crumb”. Fol-
lowing the bread crumb, the routers thus know the ”shortest”
topology path to the ”best” available copies. The distributed
registration and topology-aware FIB entries enable the pro-
posed design being scalable, available, resilient, and better
support for local service and mobility.
2. URL-LIKE NAMING SCHEME
The proposed URL-like naming scheme deﬁnes register
location and content identiﬁer as Fig. 1. Di↵ering from tra-
ditional URL which indicates to source servers, the location
embedded in the name is pointed to register node. The iden-
tiﬁer is the unique identiﬁcation of content. Here we assume
it is persistent and authenticated as deﬁned in CCNx [3].
When a source wants to share a original content object, it
ﬁrst selects a local router as the register node, and sends a
Register message towards it by the procedures in Sec. 3.2.
A unique content name is then generated which consists of
register location and content identiﬁer. This name will be
published on public web pages or portal. Any user who is
interesting in it can obtain this name through search engine,
recommendation system, etc.
3. NAME-BASED ROUTING
3.1 Content Router
Content router consists of four components as Fig. 2.
Besides the same components as CCNx, we also introduce
a Topology-aware Routing Table (TRT) to exploit network
topology information. TRT is generated using classical topology-
based routing protocols.
Interest messages are forwarded either towards a ”known”
copy by name, or towards a register node by location. Once
the Interest arrives on a router, CS will look up local cache
on the content name. If there is a copy in the CS, it will be
sent back along the path the Interest arrived on. Otherwise,
the router will check the PIT table.
If there is an exact-
match PIT entry, the Interest’s arrival link will be added to
the PIT entry. Otherwise, it looks up FIT table. If there is
a match entry, the Interest is forwarded along the matching
FIB entry. Otherwise, it looks up TRT and forwards Interest
towards the location of register, which knows the routing
information of all available replicas.

3.2 Topology-aware FIB
The topology-ware FIB entries are built by using topology-
based routing protocols. Any node with a copy would send
a Register message towards registers nodes. And all en-
path intermediate routers will record FIB entries pointed to
the arriving links. Since the path towards register nodes
is topology-aware, obtained FIB entries are also topology-
aware. Besides that, in the Interest forwarding procedure,
routers also add a FIB entry in data reverse path.
Now we give an example in Fig. 3. Assume Node B has a
ﬁle tccn.mpg to share, it registers the ﬁle in a local router E.
A new content name ccn://E/tccn.mpg is published. Router
E also adds a new entry pointed to Node B. A requester C
wants to retrieve the ﬁle, but local router has no entry for
this ﬁle. Interest is forwarded to the register E by the short
path routing protocols. All en-path routers H and D record
FIB entries for this ﬁle. If a copy moves to Node A, it sends
a Register toward the register E. All intermediate nodes D
and E would record a new entry pointed to the input links.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we introduce a topology-aware name-based
routing protocol. Data is forwarded by content identiﬁer
while FIB entries are build by topology-based routing pro-
tocols. The distributed registration and topology-aware FIB
routing enable the proposed design being scalable, available,
and better support for mobility.
