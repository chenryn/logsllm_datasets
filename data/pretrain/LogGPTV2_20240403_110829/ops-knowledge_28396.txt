User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there a linux log for when a user is denied access to files due to permissions Is there a log file which keeps track of things users try to do and are denied due to regular unix file permissions.  I know selinux does things, but a lot of the time the good ole' file permissions stop them first.  When this happens, is there a log that gets printed to.

Thanks
