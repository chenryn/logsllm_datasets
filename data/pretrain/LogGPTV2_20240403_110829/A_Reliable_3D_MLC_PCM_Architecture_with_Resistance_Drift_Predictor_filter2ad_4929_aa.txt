## Abstract
In this paper, we address the issue of resistance drift in Multi-Level Cell (MLC) Phase Change Memory (PCM) and propose a solution to mitigate its thermally-affected accelerated rate in 3D Chip-Multiprocessors (CMPs). Our approach is based on the observation that instead of using large margins or error correction codes to alleviate resistance drift, the PCM read circuit can be reconfigured to dynamically tolerate most drift errors. By characterizing memory access patterns for 22 applications, we propose an efficient mechanism to facilitate a reliable read scheme. This mechanism tolerates early-cycle resistance drifts by using narrow margins, thereby saving energy and improving cell endurance, and late-cycle resistance drifts by accurately estimating resistance thresholds for sensing. Evaluations on a true 3D architecture, consisting of a 4-core CMP and a banked 2-bit PCM memory, show that our proposal reduces the error rate by a factor of 106 compared to state-of-the-art PCM designs.

## I. Introduction
Future multicore systems must prioritize power as a primary design constraint, aiming to limit power consumption while ensuring it is proportional to system performance and reliability. Phase Change Memory (PCM) is a promising candidate for main memory in modern computer systems due to its high scalability, negligible leakage power, and non-volatility. Recent studies have shown that 3D stacking can significantly reduce the dynamic power of PCM writes, thanks to its thermal-friendly programming mechanism. This reduction in peak power relaxes thermal constraints, potentially increasing the operating frequency of the system.

PCM is a resistive non-volatile memory that uses the phase-changing properties of chalcogenide glass (e.g., Ge2Sb2Te5, GST) to switch between high-resistance amorphous and low-resistance crystalline states. One major challenge in PCM-based designs, particularly for MLC PCM, is the reliability issue of resistance drift. MLC devices rely on fine-grained GST resistance partitioning and reduced resistance margins, which can lead to cells representing incorrect states over time due to the meta-stability of amorphous states. This phenomenon, known as resistance drift, is a significant concern in MLC PCM.

Resistance drift is a thermally-affected phenomenon, and elevated temperatures in 3D integration can increase the drift error rate. Therefore, a good design must consider both the resident time of the main memory block and the impact of temperature, especially in 3D chips. In this paper, we investigate the impact of temperature on resistance drift and propose a hybrid mechanism that combines well-defined inter-level margins and a time- and temperature-aware sensing approach to effectively address the resistance drift issue in modern 3D CMPs.

## II. Background on Phase Change Memory
### A. PCM
PCM is a resistive non-volatile memory that uses the phase-changing properties of chalcogenide glass (GST) to provide memory behavior. GST has two basic states: high-resistance amorphous ("0") and low-resistance crystalline ("1"). Single-Level Cell (SLC) PCM stores one bit per cell, while Multi-Level Cell (MLC) PCM can store more than one bit by utilizing intermediate semi-amorphous states. Programming a cell involves RESET and SET pulses, with MLC controllers relying on a repetitive Program-and-Verify (P&V) technique to achieve the desired resistance. Reading a cell involves comparing the read current to a reference value, with the ability to adjust threshold voltages dynamically.

### B. Resistance Drift
Resistance drift occurs after a PCM cell is programmed, with the resistance value increasing over time, particularly at higher temperatures. While SLC PCM is less affected by drift, MLC PCM is more susceptible due to the fine-grained resistance partitioning. This can result in cells representing incorrect values, leading to data corruption.

## III. Motivation
The motivation for this research stems from the need to address the high error rates caused by resistance drift in MLC PCM, especially in 3D integrated systems where temperatures are higher. Traditional solutions like large margins or error correction codes are not sufficient, and a more dynamic and adaptive approach is required.

## IV. Related Work
[This section will discuss existing literature and prior work on resistance drift in PCM and related mitigation techniques.]

## V. Proposed Drift-Resilient MLC PCM Design
Our proposed design includes a drift controller unit that determines the significance of resistance drift and adjusts the threshold voltages for adaptive sensing. The effectiveness of this scheme depends on the accuracy of the read circuit, which is enhanced by a programmable sensing unit. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in error rates.

## VI. Evaluation
Evaluations on a true 3D architecture, consisting of a 4-core CMP and a banked 2-bit PCM memory, show that our proposal provides a 106Ã— improvement in bit error rate compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

## VII. Results Overview

## VIII. Conclusions
In conclusion, our proposed hybrid mechanism effectively addresses the resistance drift issue in MLC PCM, particularly in 3D CMPs. By combining well-defined inter-level margins and a time- and temperature-aware sensing approach, we achieve a significant reduction in error rates, making MLC PCM a practical and reliable solution for future memory systems.
