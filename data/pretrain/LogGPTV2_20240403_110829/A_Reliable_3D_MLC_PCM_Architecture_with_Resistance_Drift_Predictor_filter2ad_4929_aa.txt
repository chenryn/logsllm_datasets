Abstract—In this paper, we study the problem of resistance
drift in an MLC Phase Change Memory (PCM) and propose
a solution to circumvent its thermally-affected accelerated rate
in 3D CMPs. Our scheme is based on the observation that
instead of alleviating the problem of resistance drift by using
large margins or error correction codes, the PCM read circuit
can be reconﬁgured for tolerating most of the resistance drift
errors in a dynamic manner. Through detailed characterization
of memory access patterns for 22 applications, we propose
an efﬁcient mechanism to facilitate such reliable read scheme
via tolerating (a) early-cycle resistance drifts by using narrow
margins so that considerably saving energy of writes and
improving cell endurance, and (b) late-cycle resistance drifts by
accurately estimating resistance thresholds that separate states
for sensing. Evaluations on a true 3D architecture, consisting
of a 4-core CMP and a banked 2-bit PCM memory, show that
our proposal provides 106× lower error rate compared to the
state-of-the-art designs of PCMs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Future multicore systems must treat power as a ﬁrst-
class design constraint, and should seek not only to limit
power but also make it proportional to system performance
and reliability. Phase Change Memory (PCM) with high
scalability, negligible leakage power consumption and non-
volatility is a promising candidate to be used as main
memory in the modern computer systems [16]. Recently, it
is experimentally shown that with 3D stacking, the dynamic
power of PCM writes can be considerably reduced due to its
thermal-friendly programming mechanism [34]. This reduc-
tion in peak power relaxes thermal constraints of the CMP
chip which in turn could increase the operating frequency
of the system [34].
PCM is a resistive non-volatile memory that uses phase
changing properties of chalcogenide glass (e.g. Ge2Sb2Te5,
GST) to switch between two states with completely different
resistances: high-resistance amorphous and low-resistance
crystalline. One major problem that should be addressed
for PCM-based designs is the reliability issues of resistance
drift. This is particularly true for Multi-Level Cell (MLC)
based PCM [9]. In order to store more bits in a single cell,
MLC devices rely on ﬁne-grained GST resistance partition-
ing and reduced resistance margins separating these states.
Due to meta-stability of amorphous states, the resistance of
a cell is expected to shift upward over time which causes a
cell to represent a wrong state. This phenomenon is called
resistance drift and is the main concern in MLC PCM [2],
[22], [30], [33]. Although source of error for MLC PCM and
DRAM memories are different (in the former resistance drift
is main concern and for the later high energy particle like
terrestrial neutrons), but in terms of error rate, signiﬁcant
gap has been observed [27]. Hence, MLC PCM memory is
practical, if the high error rate of resistance drift is suitably
addressed with least
impact on performance and energy
efﬁciency of design.
is investigated ﬁrstly, and then it
Unfortunately, resistance drift is a thermally-affected phe-
nomenon and it is shown that elevated temperature of 3D
integration can increase resistance drift error rate caused
by resistance drift 2× [33]. Hence, besides considering
resident time of main memory block, a good design must
contemplate the impact of temperature, especially in 3D
chips. Accordingly in this paper, the impact of temperature
on resistance drift
is
shown although classic solutions like inter-level margins are
ineffective for worst case of resistance drift, it could handle a
signiﬁcant portion of memory accesses. Hence, based on our
observation on different multi-thread and multi-programmed
workloads, we may relax required margin size of an MLC
to postpone errors induced by resistance drift at early cycles
and low temperatures. We show that a reasonable margin
size is enough to energy-efﬁciently eliminate drift-induced
read out errors for a high percentage of memory accesses
(60% to 70%).
Alternatively if either one of memory block resident time
or chip temperature increases, MLC sensing scheme should
be carried out in a time- and temperature-aware manner.
Using the analytical model for resistance drift derived from
experimental results, we are able to predict the behavior
of resistance drift phenomenon for different elapsed times
and elevated system temperatures. Based on this prediction,
we can adjust the new border of each state, hence inter-
pret state of the cell dynamically. The efﬁciency of this
mechanism relies on two features of resistance drift: ﬁrst,
resistance drift causes upward increase in cell resistance, and
second, its dependency to time and temperature variations
can be accurately predicted by a simple analytical model.

Our design includes a drift controller unit that determines
the resistance drift signiﬁcance and adjusts the threshold
voltages for adaptive sensing. The effectiveness of this
memory sensing scheme depends on the accuracy of read
circuit to be precisely programmed at discrete threshold
voltages. To address this issue and hence cost-effectively
improve the data retention time, we use a programmable
sensing unit in read circuit to improve the feasibility of ﬁne-
grained threshold voltages. The experimental results show
that utilizing the proposed design considerations noticeably
changes the error rate of the PCM memory systems.
The main contributions of this research can be summa-
rized as follows:
• Resistance Drift Problem in 3D MLC PCM: We
highlight the fact that resistance drift in MLC PCM is
an important problem and it could be fatal in 3D chips
where the average temperature is higher than that of
the 2D chips.
• Resistance Drift Model: We introduce a practical time-
and temperature-aware model for estimating behavior
of resistance drift for any initial resistance, elapsed
time and temperature. Using this model, we can predict
cell resistance after drift. Hence, the sensing voltage
adjustment of read circuit with high precision will be
possible and this in turn leads to correct interpretation
of cell state.
• Resistance Drift Resilient PCM Memory: Based on
full-system simulation results, we show that the hybrid
mechanism composed of well-deﬁned size inter-level
margins as classic solution and time- and temperature-
aware sensing approach can effectively address the re-
sistance drift issue in modern 3D CMPs. Evaluations on
a true 3D architecture, consisting of a 4-core CMP and
a banked 2-bit PCM memory, show that our proposal
provides 106× improvement
in bit error rate when
compared to state-of-the-art solutions [2], [30].
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
gives the necessary background on 3D die-stacked MLC
PCMs. In Section III, we argue about our motivation. Next,
we present
the related work in Section IV. Section V
presents details of the proposed drift-resilience MLC PCM
design that is then evaluated in Section VI. In Section VII
an overview of the results is provided. Finally, conclusions
are presented in section VIII.
II. BACKGROUND ON PHASE CHANGE MEMORY
We ﬁrst present the fundamental concept of PCM and
then provide an overview of resistance drift as main source
of soft error in MLC PCM.

states: amorphus and crystalline. Amorphus state that shows
high resistivity is “0” equivalent and low resistance crys-
talline state represent “1” logic. This type of memory is
called Single-Level Cell (SLC) and can store one bit per
cell of memory array. To program a cell, for RESET, a
large current is injected into the cell to melt a small region
of GST that is then quenched into the amorphous state by
abruptly cutting off the current. For SET, the current pulse
is smaller in amplitude but longer in duration. Therefore, the
GST is heated to a temperature between melting point and
crystallization point making it to be crystalline
Multi-level PCM. As the resistance range of GST is wide,
it is feasible to store more than one bit in each cell. This
technology is called Multi-Level Cell (MLC) and relies on
more than two states: high-resistance amorphous (RESET),
low resistance crystalline (SET) (as in SLC technology),
and some semi-amorphous states. For example, distribution
of a 2-bit per cell memory with four different states is
shown in Fig. 1 (a). In this ﬁgure, the resistance spectrum is
partitioned into four bit patterns. Between each two adjacent
states, a resistance guard exists to overcome overlapped
situation. To program a cell, RESET and SET pulses are
similar to those of SLC technology. However, for semi-
amorphous states, MLC PCM controllers widely rely on a
repetitive Program-and-Verify (P&V) technique [21]: when
write circuit receives a request, it ﬁrst generates SET and
RESET pulses as the initialization for the write process, and

then applies a sequence of partial SET pulses to gradually
crystallize it. After each SET pulse, the circuit reads the
resistance value and veriﬁes whether it falls within the target
band; if so, the write process is completed. Otherwise, the
circuit recalculates the SET pulse parameters and repeats
P&V steps. Fig. 1 (b) shows P&V process to achieve the
desirable resistance in a typical cell. Due to variability
of process technology and P&V scheme, each state in
MLC mode corresponds to a range of resistance values and
adjacent states are separated by a margin. To read a cell,
a read circuit introduced in [23] is used, which is depicted
in Fig. 1(c). As can be seen in the ﬁgure, the memory cell
is driven with a voltage ramp, Vscan, and the read current,
Iscan, is concurrently compared to the reference value, Idet.
The cell state is then detected by the time, or the number of
voltage steps, it takes for the Iscan to be equal to Idet. The
value of Idet must be safely below the current corresponding
to the voltage at threshold switching. An important feature
of this read circuit is its ability of interpreting cell state
in a dynamic manner. In other words, we can adjust the
threshold voltages (V1, V2 and V3) dynamically, based on
system demand.
PCM Energy Dissipation and Latency. Changing the
phase of GST is a high cost process in terms of energy
consumption and latency. Table I represents energy and
latency of write in 2-bit MLC PCM. As can be seen in Table
I, writing and reading two additional bit-patterns (“10” and
“01”) consume more energy (about 10× compared to SET
state) and have longer latency than other states.
PCM Thermal Friendly Behavior. As previously de-
scribed, GST is used as phase change material in PCM cells
with two basic states amorphus and crystalline. The GST
material changes its phase by the application of electrical
pulses. To RESET and SET a PCM cell, it is needed to ele-
vate the temperature of GST above melting (∼600 ◦C) and
crystalline (∼300 ◦C) points, respectively. Previous study
[34] shows 7% and 3% reduction in programming power
when memory chip temperature increases from 45 ◦C to
60 ◦C and 19.4% and 15.7% reduction when it increases
from 45 ◦C to 85 ◦C, for RESET and SET, respectively.
Moreover, the prototype experimental results [15] show 4%
and 22% power savings in the two mentioned scenarios for
RESET. The increased temperature has a positive impact on
power consumption of a PCM cell which makes PCM a
thermal friendly memory.

experimentally found that TSVs substantially increase the
bus frequency and the bandwidth of DRAM main mem-
ory that contribute to a signiﬁcant improvement in system
performance [5], [17]. However, technological constraints
the stacked-DRAM efﬁciency in two ways: i) the
limit
increased temperature of 3D chips causes the DRAM to
consume more refresh power, ii) the capacity of the avail-
able stacked-DRAM prototypes is much lower than what
modern benchmarks require. As such, most proposals for
stacked-DRAM use this technology for last-level cache [11],
[13]. In contrast to DRAM, PCM memory is heat-driven,
scalable and capable of storing multiple bits per cell, besides
3D chips have higher average temperature and are faster,
because of vertically layer dissipating power (more power
density) and TSV, respectively [5]. Hence, these features
motivate the designers to use PCM as a main memory in a
3D fashion design [34].
B. Resistance Drift
The drift process starts once a PCM cell is programmed.
Due to the thermally-affected atomic rearrangement of the
amorphous structure,
the resistance value increases with
time and this increment is accelerated as chip temperature
increases [9], [30]. The amorphous particles are less com-
mon in the crystalline state and hence, resistance drift is
less signiﬁcant for the states near to the crystalline state.
Resistance drift
is not a concern for SLC PCM, since
crystalline state remains nearly stable while resistance of
the amorphous state increases. Therefore, as Fig. 2 (a)
shows, the resistance difference between SET and RESET
increases which in turn makes overlapping of adjacent cells
impossible. On the other hand, in MLC mode, resistance
drift in intermediate states may result in a cell to representing
a wrong value. More precisely, as can be seen in Fig.2 (b),
when retrieving a data value, the initial resistance may shift
out of the predetermined range and overlap with adjacent
