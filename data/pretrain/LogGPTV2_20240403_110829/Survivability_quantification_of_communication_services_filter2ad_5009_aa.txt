Abstract
Our society is heavily dependent on a wide variety of
communication services. These services must be available
even when undesirable events like sabotage, natural disas-
ters, or network failures happen. The network survivability
as deﬁned by the ANSI T1A1.2 committee [1] is the tran-
sient performance from the instant an undesirable event oc-
curs until steady state with an acceptable performance level
is attained.
In this paper we assess the survivability of a network
with virtual connections exposed to link or node failures.
We have developed both simulation and analytic models
to cross validate our assumptions. In order to avoid state
space explosion while addressing large networks we de-
compose our models ﬁrst in space by studying the nodes
independently and then in time by decoupling our analytic
performance and recovery models which gives us a closed
form solution. The modeling approaches are applied to two
network examples. The results show very good correspon-
dence between the transient loss and delay performance in
our simulations and in the analytic approximations.

Introduction
Our society is heavily dependent on a wide variety of
communication services to support our demands for every-
thing from pure entertainment to commerce, banking and
life critical services. The current trend is to integrate all
these services on the same communication platform. Such
an integrated multi-service network must provide virtual
connections with highly differing QoS requirements with
differentiated resilience requirements [6]. Management of
such virtual connections is a challenging task since the set
of operational virtual connections need to be continuously
updated as the trafﬁc load changes, new virtual connections
need to be almost immediately available when established
connections are affected by failures, and new or repaired
network elements must be put into operation without un-
necessary delays with priority to highly critical services. A
large variety of management techniques exist and are un-
der development. They apply to different network layers,
use pre-planned or reactive techniques, and utilize various
setup methods with different resource utilization on local
or global operational domain and scope of repair. For an
excellent classiﬁcation of recovery techniques and current
state of art the readers are referred to [6].
A model for the evaluation of the virtual connection
management needs to consider both the behavioral as well
as the structural aspects of the system. This means that the
model must capture how the performance of the virtual con-
nection is affected by routing and rerouting, by failures, by
trafﬁc load variations, by changes in network capacities, and
by different service requirements. Structural dependabil-
ity models typically focus on the probabilities of terminal
connectivity, while behavioral models, e.g., as proposed in
[13], take the network dynamics into account and provide
steady state service availability. Combining structural and
behavior aspects is typically done using Markov depend-
ability models or queuing network models for performance
analysis. Further, combined study of performance and de-
pendability is carried out by Markov reward type models
[23, 14].
In this paper our main concern is the survivability, or
the transient performance of the virtual connections after
an undesired event as deﬁned by the ANSI T1A1.2 com-
mittee [1]. Survivability models are close cousins of per-
formability models [23, 14] with the focus on transient
performance immediately after an undesired event. This
makes sense because, ideally, the QoS and resilience re-
quirements should still be met even when the network suf-
fers from overload or network element failures, irrespec-
tively of whether this is caused by physical or logical bugs,
sabotage or a natural disaster. The awareness of surviv-
ability has gained much attention due to acknowledgement
of the society’s dependence on communication services
clearly demonstrated by some unfortunate events. Well-

the failed links and nodes, which results in improved per-
formance. In this section a phased recovery model of the
rerouting and restoration is introduced. In addition, the cor-
responding phase dependent performance metrics are de-
scribed that will be applied in the survivability quantiﬁca-
tion models and examples later in this paper.
Suppose a measure of interest M has the value m0 just
before a failure occurs. The survivability behavior can be
depicted by the following attributes: ma is the value of M
just after the failure occurs; mu is the maximum difference
between the value of M and ma after the failure; mr is
the restored value of M after some time tr; and tr is the
relaxation time for the system to restore the value of M.
The attributes are illustrated in Figure 1. The measure
of interest M will in this paper be performance metrics like
the loss probability and mean delay of non-lost packets.

Speciﬁcally, the transient system behavior immediately
after the occurrence of a failure can be analyzed under our
proposed approach. Early related work can be found in [5,
28] and more recent work in [9, 22, 21].
In this paper the network survivability is quantiﬁed by
the transient performance of virtual connections that are
exposed to link or node failures. The performance de-
pends on the resources available in the network for the vir-
tual connections. In Section 2 the phased recovery model

and link failures. The phased recovery model can be modi-
ﬁed to reﬁne the rerouting phases to also model the gradual
changes in the routing probabilities or multiple steps in the
virtual connection management scheme, or to model other
failure modes like intermittent link failures.

this event. This can be modeled by phases where each phase
may have different set of available resources for the virtual
connections, represented as (possibly) phase-dependent sta-
tionary routing probabilities {qij(y)} with corresponding
phase-dependent arrival rates Γi(y). A similar approach
was taken in [28]. But in the cited paper the recovery was
not considered whereas here we model both rerouting and
restoration of the network resources that brings the system
back to fault free operation. Furthermore, the decomposi-
tions that we propose here are also new. In Figure 2 the life
cycle of the failure and rerouting is described in four phases,
y = I,··· , IV .
Phase I Immediately after the failure the rerouting pro-
cedure is activated but
takes some time before
the rerouting is effective. Meanwhile, the packets
are routed according to the original routing scheme,
qij(I) = qij(IV ), except for the failed node i and link
[i, j] where qij(I) = 0, i.e. no packets are fed for-
ward from these nodes and links. The rerouting time is
exponentially distributed with rate αd.
it
Phase II When the rerouting is effective the link or node
is still failed. The packets are routed according to a
new routing scheme and will avoid these failed links or
nodes (if possible). After the exponentially distributed
repair time with rate τ, the system enters phase III.
Phase III On completion of repair the system returns to
failure free state but the routing is yet to change. After
an exponentially distributed rerouting time with rate
αu, the system is back to normal routing in phase IV .
Phase II and III may have identical routing probabil-
ities with qij(II) =q ij(III).
In this case the two
states can be lumped together to reduce state space
though the model will then be semi-Markov.
Phase IV After the routing information is restored the net-
work operates in fault free mode, which is an ab-
sorbing state for the purpose of survivability analy-
sis [21, 22].
In this paper we assume one failure event at a time. An event
can include any combination of multiple simultaneous node
As mentioned in the introduction the survivability is
quantiﬁed by the transient performance of the system af-
ter an undesired event [1]. In this paper the performance
metric M includes the transient loss rate L(t) at time t,
the loss probability l(t) at time t, the number of packets
in the system N(t) at time t, and the mean end-to-end de-
lay of packets that are not lost in the virtual connection,
D(t). In the survivability models in the following sections
