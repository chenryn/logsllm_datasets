## Abstract
Modern society heavily relies on a wide range of communication services for various purposes, from entertainment to critical life-supporting functions. These services must remain available even during undesirable events such as sabotage, natural disasters, or network failures. The ANSI T1A1.2 committee defines network survivability as the transient performance from the moment an undesirable event occurs until a steady state with acceptable performance is achieved.

In this paper, we assess the survivability of a network with virtual connections exposed to link or node failures. We have developed both simulation and analytic models to cross-validate our assumptions. To manage the complexity of large networks, we decompose our models in space by studying nodes independently and in time by decoupling our analytic performance and recovery models, which provides a closed-form solution. These modeling approaches are applied to two network examples, and the results show a strong correspondence between the transient loss and delay performance in simulations and analytic approximations.

## 1. Introduction
Society's dependence on communication services for various needs, including entertainment, commerce, banking, and life-critical services, is profound. The trend is to integrate these services on a single communication platform, necessitating virtual connections with highly differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) and resilience requirements. Managing such virtual connections is challenging, as the set of operational connections must be continuously updated, new connections need to be rapidly established, and network elements must be put into operation without unnecessary delays, prioritizing highly critical services.

Various management techniques exist and are under development, applicable to different network layers, using pre-planned or reactive methods, and employing various setup methods with different resource utilization. For a detailed classification of recovery techniques and the current state of the art, readers are referred to [6].

A model for evaluating virtual connection management must consider both behavioral and structural aspects. This includes how the performance of virtual connections is affected by routing and rerouting, failures, traffic load variations, changes in network capacities, and different service requirements. Structural dependability models typically focus on terminal connectivity probabilities, while behavioral models, such as those proposed in [13], account for network dynamics and provide steady-state service availability. Combining these aspects is often done using Markov dependability models or queuing network models for performance analysis. Additionally, combined studies of performance and dependability use Markov reward type models [23, 14].

In this paper, our primary concern is the survivability, or the transient performance of virtual connections after an undesired event, as defined by the ANSI T1A1.2 committee [1]. Survivability models, closely related to performability models [23, 14], focus on transient performance immediately after an undesired event. This is crucial because QoS and resilience requirements should still be met even when the network suffers from overload or network element failures, regardless of whether the cause is physical or logical bugs, sabotage, or natural disasters. The importance of survivability has gained significant attention due to the demonstrated societal dependence on communication services, as seen in unfortunate events like the failure of the Galaxy IV communication satellite in 1998 and the September 11 attacks.

## 2. Phased Recovery Model
The phased recovery model describes the cycle from an undesired event causing one or multiple links or nodes to fail until the system returns to its pre-failure state. This can be modeled in phases, each with different sets of available resources for virtual connections, represented by phase-dependent stationary routing probabilities {qij(y)} and corresponding phase-dependent arrival rates Γi(y).

### 2.1 Phased Recovery Model
- **Phase I:** Immediately after the failure, the rerouting procedure is activated but takes some time to become effective. Packets are routed according to the original scheme, except for the failed node and link, where qij(I) = 0. The rerouting time is exponentially distributed with rate αd.
- **Phase II:** Once rerouting is effective, packets are routed according to a new scheme, avoiding failed links or nodes if possible. After an exponentially distributed repair time with rate τ, the system enters Phase III.
- **Phase III:** On completion of repair, the system returns to a failure-free state, but the routing is yet to change. After an exponentially distributed rerouting time with rate αu, the system returns to normal routing in Phase IV.
- **Phase IV:** After routing information is restored, the network operates in a fault-free mode, which is an absorbing state for survivability analysis [21, 22].

### 2.2 Performance Metrics
Survivability is quantified by the transient performance of the system after an undesired event [1]. The performance metric M includes the transient loss rate L(t), the loss probability l(t), the number of packets in the system N(t), and the mean end-to-end delay D(t) of non-lost packets.

## 3. Methodology
We develop both simulation and analytic models to cross-validate our assumptions. To avoid state space explosion, we decompose our models in space by studying nodes independently and in time by decoupling our analytic performance and recovery models, providing a closed-form solution.

## 4. Results
The numerical results, shown in Figure 4(a), demonstrate the survivability attributes of the performance metrics. The model scalability and assumptions are discussed, and errors incurred by the space and time decomposition approximations are numerically studied by comparing against exact SRN model solutions and discrete event simulations.

## 5. Conclusion
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to quantifying the survivability of communication services. The phased recovery model and performance metrics provide a robust framework for assessing the transient performance of virtual connections after undesirable events. Future work will focus on refining the model and exploring additional characteristics of interest.
