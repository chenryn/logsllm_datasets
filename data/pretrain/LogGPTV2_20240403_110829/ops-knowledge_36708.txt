Assistant: Whether there is an exception: no exception Description: This log records information about checking the status of the virtual machine image when nova compute manager uses libvirt for image cache operations. It can be seen from the log that the image is being used by a local virtual machine on the current node, but there is no virtual machine sharing the virtual machine image on other nodes. This information is normal service status information, which can not be processed, but only used as a part of recording the service running status in the log file.
