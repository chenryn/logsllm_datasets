User: I needed to have a directly executable python script, so i started the file with #!/usr/bin/env python. However, I also need unbuffered output, so i tried #!/usr/bin/env python -u, but that fails with python -u: no such file or directory.
I found out that #/usr/bin/python -u works, but I need it to get the python in PATH to support virtual env environments.
What are my options?
Assistant: Passing arguments to the shebang line is not standard and in as you have experimented do not work in combination with env in Linux. The solution with bash is to use the builtin command "set" to set the required options. I think you can do the same to set unbuffered output of stdin with a python command.
