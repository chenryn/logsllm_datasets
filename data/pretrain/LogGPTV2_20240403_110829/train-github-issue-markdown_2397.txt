The Git menu has a couple items that use terminology that doesn't originate
from within Git. ("Sync", "Clean All", "Publish"? What are these going to do?)
Even when they do, it's still not always clear what exactly will happen when
you click them. ("Pull" pulls from where? Origin? Using its branch of of the
same name as the one that's checked out on your repo?)
Hovering over any of these items should show the commands that these items
correspond with, so you know exactly what they're going to do.
