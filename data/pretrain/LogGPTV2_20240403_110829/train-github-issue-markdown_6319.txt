See discussion on #8384 \- Running pycodestyle v2.3.1 currently reports 81
cases of `E741` which is one of a set of three style checks to avoid ambiguous
single letter names which look like numbers:
  * E741 do not use variables named ‘l’, ‘O’, or ‘I’
  * E742 do not define classes named ‘l’, ‘O’, or ‘I’
  * E743 do not define functions named ‘l’, ‘O’, or ‘I’
See https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
The reasoning being in many fonts:
  * Upper case eye looks like the digit one (`I` vs `1`)
  * Upper case oh looks like the digit zero (`O` vs `0`)
  * Upper case el looks like the digit one (`L` vs `1`)
Assuming #8384 or similar is merged, then as part of fixing this whitespace,
the style checker settings in tox.ini should be updated to stop ignoring E741.
