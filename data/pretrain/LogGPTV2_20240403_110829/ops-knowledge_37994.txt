User: List common types of cyber attacks and introduce defenses against these attacks
Assistant: Common types of network attacks include: 1. DoS attack: By sending a large number of requests to the server, occupying the network bandwidth and resources of the server, so that normal users cannot access the server. Defensive measures: For this kind of attack, you can use the firewall to limit the flow of malicious requests, and configure some parameters on the server to limit the access rate. Additionally, utilizing a CDN (Content Delivery Network) can disperse attack traffic, thereby reducing the impact of a DoS attack. 2. DDoS attack: This attack method is similar to DoS attack, but there are multiple attack sources, which makes the attack more powerful. Defense measures: Common DDoS attack defense measures include using firewalls and load balancers to mitigate attack traffic, using special software or hardware devices to detect and block attack traffic, or sharing attack traffic through cloud services. 3. Malware attack: This type of attack usually damages the target system by infecting the user's computer. Defensive measures: Users can install antivirus software and firewalls to prevent malware infection, and also install updates to maintain the security of the system. Additionally, network administrators can take steps to monitor for threats and control access to systems. 4. Phishing attack: By forging a trusted site and publishing information on it that looks legitimate, it tricks users into submitting user credentials or other confidential information. Defensive measures: Educate customers and network users on the basics of phishing and cybersecurity, and build into contracts processes for identifying and reporting suspicious behavior. 5. SQL injection attack: Access or modify data in the database by sending a request containing SQL code. Defensive measures: use application layer firewall or web application defense measures to defend against this kind of attack, and at the same time perform security configuration and control access rights on the database. As well as verify and filter all input to ensure data security. 6. Social engineering attack: Obtaining confidential information by tricking people into revealing their confidential information or accessing a system. Defensive measures: Educate users on not disclosing confidential information, while strengthening security measures such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, etc. Protect the confidentiality of company secrets.
