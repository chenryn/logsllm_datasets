Hello,

I'm experiencing an issue with horizontal definition lists. When a `<dd>` (definition description) is empty, the next `<dd>` element, if present, incorrectly takes the place of the first one.

You can see this in action here: [JSFiddle Example](http://jsfiddle.net/2R2Pb/1)

This problem occurs in Firefox when using Bootstrap 2.3.1.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
