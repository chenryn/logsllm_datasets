e-mails. We also point out that, on average, six out of the ten most
active spam senders on each day send only spams. Nevertheless,
the spam-only servers are responsible for only 23% of all e-mails,
whereas 46% of the e-mails originate from domains that send a
mixture of spams and non-spams. These results may be explained
by spammers frequently “forging” new domains. In [4], the authors
also found a large fraction of senders who send only junk (virus,
spam) e-mails. However, they found those senders accounted for a
larger fraction of the e-mails in their workloads.
Table 2 also shows that whereas 24% of all recipients are not tar-
get of spam, around 38% of them appear only in the spam workload
and receive 20% of all e-mails, in our log. Furthermore, we found
that around 50% of the spam-only recipients received less than 5
e-mails during the whole log, and that a number of them seemed
forged (e.g., randomly generated sequence of characters). These
observations lead us to speculate that many spam-only recipients
are the result of two frequent spammer actions: dictionary attacks
and removal of recipients from their target list after ﬁnding they do
not exist (i.e., after receiving a “not a user name” SMTP answer).
They also illustrate a potentially harmful side-effect of spam, which
is the use of network and computing resources for transmitting and
processing e-mails that are addressed to non-existent users and,
thus, that will be discarded only once they reach the local e-mail
server they are addressed to.
Interestingly, we found that all spams in our workload are ad-
dressed to existing domain names under the university major do-
main name. Note that there exists over a hundred different sub-
domain names under the university major domain name. Thus,
spammers seem to perform dictionary attacks by starting from a
real domain name and guessing a list of possible user names in or-
der to maximize the chance of hitting a real user. An evaluation
of the correlation between the spam content and the target domain
name to assess the knowledge of spammers with respect to their
targets is left for future work.
4. TEMPORAL VARIATION PATTERNS
IN E-MAIL TRAFFIC
This section discusses temporal variation patterns in each of our

Figure 3: Hourly Load Variation (Normalization Parameters: Max # E-mails = 2,768, Max # Bytes 197 MB)
intensity, measured in terms of the total number of e-mails and to-
tal number of bytes. Temporal variations in the numbers of distinct
e-mail recipients and senders are discussed in Section 4.2.
4.1 Load Intensity
Figure 2 shows daily load variations in the number of messages
and number of bytes, for non-spam, spam and agregate workload
respectively. The graphics show load measures normalized by the
peak daily load observed in the aggregate trafﬁc. The normalization
parameters are shown in the caption of the ﬁgure.
Figure 2-a shows that the daily load variations in the non-spam
e-mail trafﬁc exhibit the traditional bell-shape behavior, typically
observed in other web workloads [16, 18, 17], with load peaks dur-
ing weekdays and a noticeable decrease in load intensity over the
weekend (days six and seven). On the other hand, Figure 2-b shows
that spam trafﬁc does not present any signiﬁcant daily variation.
The daily numbers of e-mails and bytes are roughly uniformly dis-
tributed over the whole week. This stability in the daily spam trafﬁc
was previously observed in [7] for a much lighter workload, includ-
ing only 5% of all e-mails received. Figure 2-c shows that the im-
pact of this distinct behavior on the aggregate trafﬁc is a smoother
variation in the number of e-mails per day. The variation in the
aggregate number of bytes, on the other hand, has a pattern very
similar to the one observed in the non-spam workload, as shown
in Figure 2-c. This is because non-spam e-mails account for over
90% of all bytes received (see Table 1).
The same overall behavior is observed for the hourly load vari-
ations, as illustrated in Figure 3, for a typical day. Like in [13,
14], traditional non-spam e-mail trafﬁc (Figure 3-a) presents two
distinct and roughly stable regions: a high load diurnal period, typ-
ically from 7AM to 7PM, (i.e., working hours), during which the
central server receives between 65% and 73% of all daily non-spam
e-mails, and a low load period covering the evening, night and early
morning. On the other hand, the intensity of spam trafﬁc (Figure
3-b) is roughly insensitive to the time of the day: the fraction of
spams that arrives during a typical diurnal period is between 50%
and 54%. Figure 3-c shows that, as observed for daily load vari-
ations, the impact of spam on the aggregate trafﬁc is a less pro-
nounced hourly variation of the number of e-mails received.
Table 3 summarizes the observed hourly load variation statistics.
For each workload, it presents the ranges for minimum, maximum,
average and coefﬁcient of variation of the number of e-mails and
number of bytes received per hour, on each day. Note the higher
variability in the number of e-mails and number of bytes in the
non-spam workload. Also note that, for any of the three workloads,
a higher coefﬁcient of variation is observed in the number of bytes,
because of the inherent variability of e-mail sizes. Finally, note
that these results are consistent with those of Table 1 for the daily
variation in the number of e-mails and bytes in each workload.
