### Email Traffic Analysis and Temporal Variation Patterns

#### Spammer Behavior and Email Distribution
Our analysis reveals that, on average, six out of the ten most active spam senders each day are exclusively sending spam. However, these spam-only servers account for only 23% of all emails, while 46% of the emails originate from domains that send a mix of spam and non-spam. This discrepancy can be attributed to spammers frequently "forging" new domains. In a related study [4], the authors also observed a large fraction of senders who only send junk (virus, spam) emails, but these senders accounted for a larger proportion of the total email volume in their dataset.

Table 2 highlights that 24% of all recipients do not receive any spam, while approximately 38% appear only in the spam workload and receive 20% of all emails. Additionally, around 50% of the spam-only recipients received fewer than five emails during the entire log period. Many of these addresses appear to be forged, such as randomly generated character sequences. These observations suggest that many spam-only recipients are the result of two common spammer tactics: dictionary attacks and the removal of recipients from target lists after receiving a "not a user name" SMTP response. This behavior also underscores a potential harmful side-effect of spam: the use of network and computing resources to transmit and process emails addressed to non-existent users, which are ultimately discarded by the local email server.

Interestingly, all spam emails in our dataset were addressed to existing domain names under the university's main domain. Given that there are over a hundred different sub-domains under the university's main domain, it appears that spammers perform dictionary attacks by starting with a real domain name and guessing a list of possible usernames to maximize the chances of hitting a real user. An evaluation of the correlation between spam content and target domain names to assess spammers' knowledge of their targets is planned for future work.

#### Temporal Variation Patterns in Email Traffic

This section examines the temporal variation patterns in our three email workloads: spam, non-spam, and aggregate. Section 4.1 analyzes daily and hourly variations in load intensity, measured in terms of the total number of emails and bytes. Section 4.2 discusses the variations in the number of distinct email recipients and senders.

##### 4.1 Load Intensity

**Daily Load Variations**

Figure 2 illustrates the daily load variations in the number of messages and bytes for non-spam, spam, and aggregate workloads, respectively. The data is normalized by the peak daily load observed in the aggregate traffic, with normalization parameters provided in the figure caption.

- **Non-Spam Traffic (Figure 2-a)**: The daily load variations in non-spam email traffic exhibit a traditional bell-shaped pattern, typical of other web workloads [16, 18, 17]. Load peaks occur during weekdays, with a noticeable decrease over the weekend (days six and seven).
- **Spam Traffic (Figure 2-b)**: Spam traffic shows no significant daily variation. The number of emails and bytes is roughly uniformly distributed throughout the week. This stability in daily spam traffic was previously observed in [7] for a lighter workload, including only 5% of all emails.
- **Aggregate Traffic (Figure 2-c)**: The impact of the distinct behavior of spam and non-spam traffic on the aggregate traffic results in a smoother variation in the number of emails per day. The variation in the aggregate number of bytes, however, follows a pattern similar to the non-spam workload, as non-spam emails account for over 90% of all bytes received (see Table 1).

**Hourly Load Variations**

Figure 3 illustrates the hourly load variations for a typical day, showing the same overall behavior as the daily load variations.

- **Non-Spam Traffic (Figure 3-a)**: Non-spam email traffic presents two distinct and stable regions: a high-load diurnal period (typically from 7 AM to 7 PM, or working hours), during which the central server receives between 65% and 73% of all daily non-spam emails, and a low-load period covering the evening, night, and early morning.
- **Spam Traffic (Figure 3-b)**: The intensity of spam traffic is relatively insensitive to the time of day, with 50% to 54% of spams arriving during the typical diurnal period.
- **Aggregate Traffic (Figure 3-c)**: As observed for daily load variations, the impact of spam on the aggregate traffic is a less pronounced hourly variation in the number of emails received.

Table 3 summarizes the observed hourly load variation statistics, presenting the ranges for minimum, maximum, average, and coefficient of variation of the number of emails and bytes received per hour. The non-spam workload exhibits higher variability in the number of emails and bytes, and a higher coefficient of variation is observed in the number of bytes due to the inherent variability of email sizes.

##### 4.2 Number of Recipients and Senders

Table 4 provides a summary of the hourly variation in the number of distinct recipients and senders for each workload. The table includes the ranges for minimum, maximum, average, and coefficient of variation for the number of distinct recipients and senders per hour.

- **Non-Spam Traffic**: The number of distinct recipients and senders varies significantly, with a higher coefficient of variation in the number of bytes.
- **Spam Traffic**: The number of distinct recipients and senders is more consistent, with a lower coefficient of variation.
- **Aggregate Traffic**: The combined effect of both spam and non-spam traffic results in a moderate variation in the number of distinct recipients and senders.

These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the temporal patterns and distribution of email traffic, highlighting the distinct behaviors of spam and non-spam workloads.
