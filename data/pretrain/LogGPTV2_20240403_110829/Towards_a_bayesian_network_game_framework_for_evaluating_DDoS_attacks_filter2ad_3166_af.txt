Appendix A: Semi Network-Form Game [10]
The formal deﬁnition of semi network-form game uses the
following notations. ∆Z denotes the probabilistic simplex
over a space Z, and ∆Z|Y = ×y∈Y ∆Z is the space of all
possible conditional distributions of z ∈ Z conditioned on
y ∈ Y . As in standard game theory, for any particular
player i, −i is used to denote the set of all players excluding
player i.
A semi network-form game involving N players is a quin-
tuple (G, X, u, R, π) that satisﬁes the following conditions:
1. G is a ﬁnite directed acyclic graph {V, E}, where V and
E are the sets of nodes and edges in it, respectively.
For any node v ∈ V , we let pa(v) denote the set of
parent nodes of v.
5642. X is a Cartesian product of |V | ﬁnite sets, each with at
least two elements. Xv denotes the set corresponding
to v ∈ V , and Xpa(v) the Cartesian product of sets
for all elements in pa(v). Intuitively, Xv contains all
possible states at node v and Xpa(v) all possible states
of v’s parent nodes.
3. u is a function X → RN . It also can be seen as a set
of N utility functions ui : X → R for each player i.
4. R is a partition of V into N + 1 subsets. Each of R(i),
where 1 ≤ i ≤ N , contains a single element, which is a
decision node, and all elements in R(N + 1) are chance
nodes. D = ∪N
i=1R(i) and C = R(N + 1) represent the
set of decision nodes and chance nodes, respectively.
5. π is a function from v ∈ R(N +1) → ∆Xv|×v(cid:48)∈pa(v)Xv(cid:48) .
That is to say, π assigns to every chance node v ∈
R(N + 1) a conditional probability distribution of v
conditioned on the states of its parents.
In a semi network-form game, each player needs to infer
the system state based on her observed information, and
then takes the best-response action. A player performs sta-
tistical inference by treating G, augmented with conditional
probability functions in π, in the semi network-form game
as a Bayesian graphical model. Typically, it is diﬃcult to
derive a closed form of posterior probability distributions for
a Bayesian network conditioned on some observed informa-
tion, and hence sampling techniques such as forward sam-
pling and importance sampling are widely used for approxi-
mating these distributions. In the context of semi network-
form games, however, the challenge is how to sample from
a decision node, as in the deﬁnition of a semi network-form
game no conditional probability distributions are speciﬁed
for these nodes. Note that π is only deﬁned for chance nodes
in the model.
To address this challenge, level-K relaxed strategies are
proposed. The key idea is level-K thinking,
in which a
player’s reasoning is recursively deﬁned with level K. Deﬁne
the level-K relaxed strategy of a decision node v ∈ D, where
K ≥ 1, to be ΛK−1(Xv(cid:48) | Xpa(v(cid:48))). We have the following
deﬁnitions for a semi network-form game (G, X, u, R, π):
• U = V \ {v, pa(v)},
• P K (Xv | Xpa(v)) = π(Xv | Xpa(v)) if v ∈ C,
• P K (Xv | Xpa(v)) = ΛK−1(Xv | Xpa(v)) if v ∈ D,
• P K (XZ ) =(cid:81)
v(cid:48)(cid:48)∈Z P K (Xv(cid:48)(cid:48) | Xpa(v(cid:48)(cid:48))).
As level-K relaxed strategies are recursively deﬁned, we
specify a level-0 distribution Λ0(Xv | xpa(v)) ∈ ∆Xv|×v(cid:48)∈pa(v)Xv(cid:48)
for every decision node. With these notations, the level-K
relaxed strategy for any decision node v ∈ D is deﬁned as
follows. First, for every decision node, a satisﬁcing function
distribution λ(Xv | xpa(v)) ∈ ∆Xv|×v(cid:48)∈pa(v)Xv(cid:48)
is speciﬁed
to indicate a player’s preference in sampling from the space
of her possible moves. Also specify two integers M and M(cid:48)
used in the sampling process. Suppose that decision node v
corresponds to player i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ N . Next, perform the
following process independently for each xpa(v) ∈ Xpa(v):
1. Choose M independent and identically distributed (IID)
samples of λ(Xv | xpa(v)). After removing all dupli-
cates, we obtain a set {x(cid:48)
v(j) : j = 1, . . . , m} with m
elements;
2. For each j where j = 1, . . . , m, choose M(cid:48) IID samples
of the joint distribution:
(cid:89)
P K (XV | x
(cid:48)
v(j), xpa(v)) =
P K (Xv(cid:48) | Xpa(v(cid:48)))δXpa(v),xpa(v) δXv ,x(cid:48)
v (j);
V (k; x(cid:48)
v(cid:48)∈V
and let {x(cid:48)
v(j)) : k = 1, . . . M(cid:48)} be the set of
these samples. In the above equation, the delta func-
tion δa,b returns 1 if a = b or 0 otherwise. Here, rejec-
tion sampling is applied: if in the sample XV node v’s
state is not x(cid:48)
v(j) or its parents’ states are not xpa(v),
the sample is simply rejected.
3. For each j where j = 1, . . . , m, we estimate player i’s
utility under her possible action x(cid:48)
v(j):
ˆuK
i (x
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
v(j)), x
U (; x
(cid:48)
v(j), xpa(v)) =
M(cid:48)(cid:88)
k=1
1
M(cid:48)
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
V (k, x
ui(x
v(j))).
(25)
4. Player i takes the best-response action x(cid:48)
v(j∗) where
∗
j
= argmaxj[ˆuK
(cid:48)
i (x
U (; x
(cid:48)
v(j)), x
(cid:48)
v(j), xpa(v))].
The rejection sampling applied by the level-K relaxed strat-
egy can be extremely costly, as a large number of samples
are rejected because they do not contain observed informa-
tion (node v’s parents’ states) or the player’s action sampled
from her satisﬁcing function. To further improve the per-
formance of the level-K relaxed strategy, the following two
optimization techniques can be adopted:
D-separation. Let X, Y, Z be three sets of nodes in a
Bayesian network. X and Y are called d-separated given
Z if there is no active trail between any node in X and any
node in Y given Z [8]. Intuitively speaking, given Z we can
guarantee the independence between X and Y , if X and Y
are d-separated given Z.
In the context of semi network-
form games, we can ﬁnd the set of nodes independent of a
decision node v given the set of its parent nodes pa(v). For
these nodes, we can sample them independently ﬁrst and
then combine them with the samples for the other nodes as
described in the level-K relaxed strategy.
Likelihood weighting. Rejection sampling is computation-
ally expensive because it rejects samples if they are incom-
patible with the evidence. Likelihood weighting is a method
that forces samples to take appropriate values at evidence
nodes and then compensate it with a weight characterizing
the likelihood that the evidence nodes take the forced values
in the sample. In the semi network-form game, calculation
of the utility function in Equation (25) is adjusted accord-
ingly to take the weight of each sample into account. Also,
we do not have to normalize the weights as unnormalized
weights are suﬃcient for comparing utilities under diﬀerent
actions.
