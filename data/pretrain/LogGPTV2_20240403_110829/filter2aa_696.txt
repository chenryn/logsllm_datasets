- **Primary Metric**: Number of delivered or served impressions.
- **Primary Problem**: Not all online ads delivered have an opportunity to be seen.

- **Clicks**
- **Conversions**

**Reference: ComScore**

   - Device/user information (device OS, device type, IP, device ID, geo, user registration data).
   - Bid request and response process.

   - 3rd party tags are fired, if applicable.
   - Ad creative loads with associated JavaScript.

   - Bots and other non-human traffic sources.

## The Bieber Project
- **Objective**: Investigating fraudulent impressions using a honeypot.
- **Collected Information**: Analyzing suspicious user agents, lack of plugins, invisible viewport sizes, zero page and mouse coordinates, and other clues.
- **Smarter Bots**: Demonstrations of malware that hijacks browsers and reproduces user events.
- **Trends Analysis**: Identifying patterns such as frequency between visits and IP block origins.
- **Human Traffic**: Examining pop-unders, pop-ups, and frames used to deliver traffic.

### Can I Buy Internet Traffic and Get Away With It?
- **Auditing**: If advertisers audit the traffic and know what to look for, you will get caught.
- **Quality of Traffic**: Directly proportional to the price paid.
  - Lower prices: Bots.
  - Higher prices: Frames, popups, or pop-unders.
