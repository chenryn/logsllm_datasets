Playwright transpiles test files with Babel. However, by default, Babel reads
browserslist config although Playwright actually doesn't need it. This
introduces conflicts when the root project uses browserslist.
For example, when the package.json contains:
      "browserslist": [
        "chrome 113"
      ],
Running `npx playwright test` with Playwright 1.32 will get `Error: Unknown
version 113 of chrome`. To fix the issue, we have to upgrade Playwright to
1.33. This behavior forces us to always upgrade Playwright if we want to
specify some latest browser versions in browserslist config even if our root
project depends on the latest version of browserslist.
To fix this issue, the following change works for me:
    diff --git a/packages/playwright-test/bundles/babel/src/babelBundleImpl.ts b/packages/playwright-test/bundles/babel/src/babelBundleImpl.ts
