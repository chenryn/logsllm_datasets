where Av and At are the sizes of the unit disk determined
by the transmission range of v and the total ﬁeld in which
I nodes are uniformly distributed, respectively; the last two
terms (in parentheses) are the conditional probabilities that
v will be a CH per the Max-ID and Min-ID policies (given
that the ordinal number of v’s ID is i, and v has n neigh-
bors), respectively.
To formulate the probability that v will become a cluster
m (v), we translate this measure into the
member, namely P scp
likelihood that there exists at least one node in v’s neighbor-
hood that will be qualiﬁed to be a CH (whose transmission
range will cover v). As it is simpler to compute the comple-
ment of this likelihood, i.e., the probability that none of v’s
neighbors will be qualiﬁed to be a CH, we have,

The solution derivation for Eq. (2) (and Eqs. (3) and (4))
is based on the following mechanism: 1) to carefully expand
and rearrange the terms; 2) to add and then subtract a term
for n = 0 (so that the summation would start from n = 0
instead of n = 1); and 3) to simplify the solution using the
Binomial theorem.
Note also that while the ordinal numbers of node IDs
are unique, for a closed-form solution of Eq. (2), we as-
sume that ID replacement is allowed (so that we can com-
pute P scp
h (u) independently). Since the node populations
of swarm systems are typically large (in the hundreds) and
the ratio of the area of a cluster to that of the total deploy-
ment ﬁeld is small, “ID collisions” (i.e., two nodes contend
for the same ID) in a cluster are unlikely. Hence, the error
resulting from the approximation would be insigniﬁcant.
For comparison, we also compute P bl
hm(v), the probabil-
ity that v will be a CH or CM in the baseline system (which
applies Max-ID or Min-ID as the sole clustering policy).
The measure is formulated in a way that is analogous to
that for P scp
hm (v). We skip the solution derivation due to
space limitations.
Clustering Redundancy
For the measure of the second type, we ﬁrst deﬁne P scp
r|ch(v)
as the probability that a cluster formed by SCP in which v
is the active CH will accommodate at least one passive CH.
Due to policy symmetry, we can formulate such a measure
as the conditional probability that cluster C contains at least
one CH that is qualiﬁed by the Min-ID (or Max-ID) policy,
given that the active CH v of C is elected per the Max-ID
(or Min-ID) policy. Letting such a conditional probability
be denoted by P min
r|chmax(v) (or P max
r|chmin(v)), we have
P scp
r|ch(v) = P min

Next, we deﬁne a measure for redundant coverage (from
an arbitrary CM’s perspective). Speciﬁcally, we evaluate
the probability that v will be covered by a passive CH
elected by the Min-ID (or Max-ID) policy, given that v is a
CM of a cluster formed by SCP per the Max-ID (or Min-ID)
policy. Letting such a conditional probability be denoted by

Gracefully Degraded Coverage
For the last measure type, we deﬁne G (a random variable)
as the fraction of the CMs (of the cluster where a CH u loses
serviceability) that will be covered by the passive CH v at
the point of takeover. Clearly, the value of G will depend
upon the distance D (a random variable) between u and v.
As mentioned earlier, in self-stabilizing systems, sta-
tistical preferences are a mechanism used for improving
the chances of achieving a goal. Moreover, the mecha-
nism is often realized by letting host behavior be driven
by a mathematical model called biased random walk (also
called “guided” or “informed” random walk). For exam-
ple, [9] proposed to apply biased random walk techniques
in MANETs for service discovery.
Accordingly, we assume that the moves a passive CH
makes are driven by a biased random walk model. In par-
ticular, when the distance between the positions of a pas-
sive CH v and the active CH u exceeds h meters (i.e., a
threshold), with probability p (p > 0.5) and 1 − p, v will
move toward and away from u, respectively. Typically, ran-
dom walks are regarded as Markov processes. Therefore,
we choose to use a SAN (stochastic activity network [12])
model to represent such random walks.
Due to node mobility, it is very difﬁcult to solve or quan-
titatively evaluate the distribution of G. Nonetheless, the
assumption of a uniformly distributed node population per-
mits us to translate G into the fraction of the area that is
covered by the active CH that is reachable by the transmis-
sion range of the passive CH, for an approximated solution
(of the distribution of G). As shown by the shaded region in
Figure 2, G is a decreasing function of D. Accordingly, we
construct a SAN model to evaluate the distribution of D and
then translate the result into the distribution of G. (Note that
to estimate G at the point of takeover is pessimistic, since
the passive CH will be able to adjust its position afterward
to progressively improve clustering coverage.)
Figure 2: Gracefully Degraded Coverage upon Takeover
Figure 3 depicts the SAN model that captures, based on
the X-Y coordinates, the two-dimensional biased random
walk of the passive CH (before it takes over from the active
CH). We exploit the marking-dependent speciﬁcation capa-
bility of SANs to make the resulting model compact.
In
particular, we use the marking-dependent speciﬁcations to
model the passive CH’s threshold-dependent random walks.
More succinctly, after D reaches threshold h, the case prob-
ability distributions for the instantaneous activities Xmv and
Ymv change correspondingly to represent the biased random
walk explained above. In order to limit the state space, we
push the computation concerning the distribution of D into
the reward variable speciﬁcation as follows:
(cid:16)(cid:112)(MARK(Xchp))2 + (MARK(Ychp))2 ≤ d
(cid:17)
if
reward rate = 1;
Figure 3: SAN Model
As described above, the movement of a passive CH is
driven by a biased random walk model. In this model, we
could choose to let the passive CH move anywhere (without
constraint), or move to any location within the cluster. We
assume the latter (which would yield a ﬁnite state space) in
order to use the analytic solvers of UltraSAN. In addition,
we notice that the transient solver shows that the probability
distribution of D becomes stationary after 25 minutes. Cou-
pled with the assumption that the time to CH failure, death,
or abrupt departure is generally much longer, that suggests
to us to use the steady-state solver for the quantitative eval-
uation.

Using Mathematica and UltraSAN, we obtain quantita-
tive results that demonstrate the effectiveness of SCP. We
ﬁrst evaluate P scp
hm (v). Figure 4 displays the results of this
measure as a function of transmission range r. In the ﬁrst
scenario, as shown in Figure 4(a), we let 200 nodes be uni-
formly distributed in a 500 × 500 ﬁeld. We see from Figure
4(a) that when the transmission range r is small (i.e., 10
meters), the values of P scp
hm (v) indicate a coverage improve-
