User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Basic auth for a Tomcat app (JIRA) with Nginx as reverse proxy I have several subdomains running the Atlassian Tomcat apps (jira.example.com, confluence.example.com, stash.example.com) and I would want to know if it is possible to password protect all of them with basic_auth with .htpasswd.

Nginx it is working ok without the basic_auth directive, but if I try to introduce it like this in nginx.conf...

user              nginx;
worker_processes  1;

error_log         /var/log/nginx/error.log;

..it asks for credentials, but then it returns a 


  HTTP Status 401 - Basic Authentication Failure - Reason :
  AUTHENTICATION_DENIED


Looks like someone managed to fix this with apache running as reverse proxy http://jira.10933.n7.nabble.com/mod-proxy-and-password-protecting-td17279.html but those links in that thread are dead...

EDIT:
Apparently this issue can be easily solved in Apache adding tomcatAuthentication="false" and using protocol="AJP/1.3" within Tomcat's server.xml connector. Or you can prevent apache from forwarding the auth with the directive RequestHeader unset authorization. Thing is, how to do it with Nginx? I guess I have to research more.. Any insights?

Assistant: Ok just found the solution on the nginx mailing list. I just had to tell nginx to not forward the auth headers to tomcat. Adding a couple of lines to the location blocks in nginx.conf did the trick:

  location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8090/;
        proxy_redirect off;

        # Password
        auth_basic "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file /home/passwd/.htpasswd;

        # Don't forward auth to Tomcat
        proxy_set_header   Authorization "";
    }


Now i just have to figure out how to prevent nginx from asking for auth on each subdomain (jira, confluence, stash, etc). Having to introduce the credentials just once for all of them would be perfect, but that's another issue. 

Hope this helps! 

Cheers.
