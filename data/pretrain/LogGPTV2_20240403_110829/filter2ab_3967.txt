**ATT&CK ID:** T1204.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Malicious Link

An adversary may exploit a user's interaction with a malicious link to gain execution on the target system. This technique often involves social engineering tactics designed to persuade the user to click on a link, which can then lead to code execution. This behavior is commonly observed as a follow-on action from [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/).

Clicking on a malicious link can also trigger other execution techniques, such as the exploitation of browser or application vulnerabilities, as seen in [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203/). Additionally, these links may direct users to download and execute malicious files, aligning with the [Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/) technique.

By combining social engineering and technical exploits, adversaries can effectively bypass security controls and compromise the target system.
