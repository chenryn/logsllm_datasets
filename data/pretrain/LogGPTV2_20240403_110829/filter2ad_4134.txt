## Abstract
Despite the promising properties of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), their integration with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has not been extensively explored. We present a PUF-based machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication extension for TLS. This extension, called DHZKP, is an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol designed to enhance TLS. We develop this protocol as a TLS extension and provide a security proof.

## 1. Introduction
Machine-to-machine (M2M) services typically use the TLS protocol to ensure secure communications between terminals and servers. However, these systems require the client to maintain a long-term cryptographic secret, which can be vulnerable to leakage. While physical protection mechanisms have been proposed, their hardware implementations are often complex and costly. Additionally, TLS lacks a robust connection between the long-term secret and the device, as the device is authenticated solely based on the stored secret in a secure enclosure. Our goal is to authenticate the device using TLS without storing a long-term secret; instead, it should be generated on demand.

PUFs offer a solution by performing device authentication while addressing the aforementioned security issues. A PUF is a physical object that, when stimulated by an external input, produces an unpredictable response due to the inherent randomness in the manufacturing process. Although previous studies have highlighted the challenges in implementing PUFs, recent research has demonstrated practical solutions. Assuming the availability of such PUFs, we propose a PUF-based client authentication scheme that works with the TLS protocol.

## 2. PUF-Based Extension for TLS
We design a new AKE protocol, termed DHZKP, which leverages PUFs. In this protocol, a resource-constrained yet PUF-enabled device and a server compute a session key and authenticate each other. The device authenticates itself by performing a zero-knowledge proof on its PUF-generated secrets, ensuring that no PUF secret is shared with the server. Our primary motivation was to integrate DHZKP into the TLS handshake, which requires three passes for authentication and session key computation. To accommodate resource-constrained devices, all computations are performed in a finite group, potentially using elliptic curves. We define a new PUF-based TLS ciphersuite and extend TLS from the DHZKP protocol to enable hardware device authentication.

## 3. Security Analysis
Based on the strong security model outlined in [1], we prove that this TLS extension is a secure Authenticated and Confidential Channel Establishment protocol, and that its truncated version is a secure AKE protocol.

## 4. Conclusion
We have designed a new AKE protocol, DHZKP, based on PUFs. This protocol has been developed as a novel extension of TLS, enabling seamless integration with the TLS handshake protocol for hardware authentication. The security of our proposed protocol has been rigorously proven. This protocol can be applied to a wide range of M2M contexts where authenticating physical objects is essential.
