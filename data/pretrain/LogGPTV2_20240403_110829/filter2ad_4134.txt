ABSTRACT
Despite the promising properties of Physical Unclonable Func-
tions (PUFs), its integration with Transport Layer Security
(TLS), has not been explored yet. We then present a PUF
based machine to machine (M2M) authentication extension
for TLS. An Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol
termed DHZKP based on PUF is designed. We develop this
protocol as a TLS extension, and prove its security.

INTRODUCTION
M2M services usually use the TLS protocol to ensure se-
cure communications between terminals and servers. How-
ever, the client must maintain a long-term cryptographic
secret which may leak. Although some physical protection
mechanisms have been proposed, their hardware implemen-
tations are always complicated and expensive. Also, TLS
lacks of solid relation between the long term secret and the
device: the device is authenticated only because its secret
is stored in a secure enclosure. Our purpose is to authen-
ticate the device using TLS without storing a long term
secret:
it must be generated on demand. PUFs are capa-
ble of performing device authentications while overcoming
the aforementioned security issues. A PUF is a physical ob-
ject being stimulated by an external stimuli returning an
unpredictable response. The unpredictable characteristic is
due to unavoidable random variation of the manufacturing
process. Although many studies concluded that the imple-
mentations of such PUFs are hard, the recent researches [3,
2] have demonstrated some practical solutions. We assume

the existence of such PUFs, and propose a PUF-based client
authentication scheme working with TLS protocol.
2. PUF BASED EXTENSION FOR TLS
We design a new AKE protocol based on PUFs, termed
DHZKP. In this protocol, a constrained yet PUF-enabled
device and a server compute the session key and authenti-
cate each other. In particular, the device authenticates itself
by performing a zero knowledge proof on its PUFs generated
secrets. Thus, no PUF secret of the device is shared with
the server. One of our strongest motivation was to integrate
DHZKP into TLS handshake:
it uses 3 passes for the au-
thentication and the computation of the session key. As we
intend to implement our protocol on resource-constrained
devices, all the computations will be done in a ﬁnite group
where elliptic curves could be used. We deﬁne a new based
PUF TLS ciphersuite and realize an extension TLS from
the DHZKP protocol in order to enable the hardware device
authentication.
3. SECURITY ANALYSIS
Based on the strong security model stated in [1], we prove
that this TLS extension is a secure Authenticated and Con-
ﬁdential Channel Establishment protocol, and that its trun-
cated version is a secure AKE protocol.
4. CONCLUSION
We designed a new AKE based on PUFs, which is named
DHZKP. It has been developed as a novel extension of TLS,
enabling seamless integration with TLS handshake protocol
for hardware authentication. The security of our proposed
protocol is proved. The protocol can be also applied to a
large variety of machine-to-machine contexts in which au-
thenticating the physical objects are often required.
