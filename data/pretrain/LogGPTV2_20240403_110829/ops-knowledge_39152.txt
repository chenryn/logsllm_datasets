**User:**

I am working with Python on a Linux system and would like to merge several `.doc` files into a single `.doc` file. The resulting file should be compatible and openable on Windows machines. I have searched the internet but haven't found any useful information.

I am aware that this feature works for PDF files using GhostScript, but I need it to work for `.doc` files as well. Does anyone have suggestions on how to solve this issue?

**Assistant:**

To merge multiple `.doc` files into a single `.doc` file in Python, you can use the `python-docx` library, which provides a convenient way to handle Word documents. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Install the `python-docx` library** if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install python-docx
   ```

2. **Read the contents of each `.doc` file** and append them to a new document.

Here is a sample code to achieve this:

```python
from docx import Document

def merge_docs(file_list, output_file):
    # Create a new document
    merged_document = Document()

    # Loop through the list of files
    for file in file_list:
        # Open each file
        sub_doc = Document(file)
        
        # Add each paragraph from the sub-document to the merged document
        for element in sub_doc.element.body:
            merged_document.element.body.append(element)

    # Save the merged document
    merged_document.save(output_file)

# List of .doc files to merge
files_to_merge = ['file1.doc', 'file2.doc', 'file3.doc']
output_filename = 'merged_document.doc'

# Call the function to merge the documents
merge_docs(files_to_merge, output_filename)
```

This script will read each `.doc` file, append its content to a new document, and then save the merged document. The resulting `.doc` file should be compatible with Windows machines.
