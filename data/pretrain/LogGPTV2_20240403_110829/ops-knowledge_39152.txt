User: In Python on Linux I would like to merge several .doc files into 1 .doc file? (The .doc file will be open in Windows machines). I have searched on internet but I don't find useful information. 
I know that this feature is working for PDF in GhostScript, but now it needs also working for doc files. 
Has somebody suggestions how to solve this issue?
Assistant: You can open and read contents of each files and write them in a separate file. You can File I/O functions.
