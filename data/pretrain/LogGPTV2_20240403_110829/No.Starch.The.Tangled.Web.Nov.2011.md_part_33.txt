### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and Alternatives

The `x.send()` method sends a request, which, following the W3C’s proposal, will include an `Origin` header. The response data will only be revealed to the caller if the server's response includes a matching `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This design does not incorporate preflight requests or permission caching.

Microsoft’s solution, known as `XDomainRequest`, is simpler, safer, and equally functional in most practical scenarios. However, it is less popular and only supported in Internet Explorer 8 and later versions. With W3C backing CORS, other browsers have no immediate reason to adopt `XDomainRequest`.

A third solution, proposed by another group of researchers under the W3C, is called Uniform Messaging Policy (UMP), accompanied by the UniformRequest API. UMP closely mirrors Microsoft’s approach but is not yet supported by any existing browser. There are discussions about potentially unifying UMP with CORS.

### Other Uses of the Origin Header

The `Origin` header is a critical component of CORS, `XDomainRequest`, and UMP. It was initially proposed by Adam Barth, Collin Jackson, and John C. Mitchell in 2008 as a more reliable and privacy-conscious alternative to the `Referer` header. The `Origin` header aims to prevent cross-site request vulnerabilities by providing the server with the origin of the request without disclosing sensitive path or query data.

The proposal for the `Origin` header faced some challenges. While it offered a subtle improvement over the `Referer` header, it was unclear whether this would make a significant difference for users who block the `Referer` header for privacy reasons. Consequently, the proposal remained in limbo, neither deployed in browsers nor encouraging other solutions like XSRF or XSSI. Recently, the concept has been revived under the name `From-Origin`.

### Utility of the Origin Header

The utility of the `Origin` header in specialized cases like CORS became evident around 2009. Adam Barth submitted an IETF draft specifying the syntax of the header, though it did not define when the header should be sent or what specific security problems it might solve. The draft states:

- The user agent **MAY** include an `Origin` header in any HTTP request.
- For requests from a "privacy-sensitive" context, the user agent **MUST** send the value `null` in the `Origin` header.

The key requirement is that, once the client chooses to provide the header, the value must accurately represent the SOP origin from which the request is made. For example, a request from `http://www.bunnyoutlet.com:1234/bunny_reports.php` should include:

```
Origin: http://www.bunnyoutlet.com:1234
```

For origins that do not map to a protocol-host-port tuple, the browser must send the value `null`.

As of now, only WebKit-based browsers include the `Origin` header on non-CORS navigation, specifically when submitting HTML forms. Firefox is considering a different approach, but no specific implementation has been finalized.

### Security Model Restriction Frameworks

Extending the same-origin policy (SOP) is relatively straightforward and typically fails securely. If a proposed change is not accounted for or not supported in a particular browser, the more restrictive SOP logic will take effect. Conversely, creating new boundaries within the existing browser security model is more dangerous, as every security-sensitive code path must be updated, and all browsers must comply immediately to avoid unexpected issues.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a comprehensive security framework first proposed by Brandon Sterne of Mozilla in 2008. Initially, CSP aimed to mitigate common web vulnerabilities such as XSRF and XSS, and to help website owners perform content-policing tasks. Over the years, CSP has evolved, and its scope has changed significantly. As of now, the canonical Mozilla specification is being rewritten as a W3C draft, leading to differences in implementations across browsers.

#### Primary CSP Directives

CSP allows site owners to specify per-document policies that constrain the actions of the document under the SOP. For example, a policy might restrict external subresources to images from trusted origins:

```
X-Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; img-src http://*.example.com
```

Policies can be specified in HTTP headers, embedded in the document, or hosted at an external URL. The following behaviors can be controlled with CSP directives:

- **Script execution**: The `script-src` directive specifies permissible script sources. CSP disables inline scripts and careless use of functions like `eval(...)`, `setTimeout(...)`, and `setInterval(...)`.
- **Plug-in content**: Controlled by `object-src`. Similar to `script-src`, this directive restricts access to plug-ins like Java or Flash.
- **Stylesheets and fonts**: Controlled by `style-src` and `font-src`. Originally, CSP did not prevent inline styles, but recent specifications have been amended to address this.
- **Passive multimedia**: Directives like `img-src` and `media-src` control the embedding of multimedia content.
- **Subframes**: The `frame-src` directive specifies acceptable destinations for `<iframe>` tags.
- **Default policy**: The `default-src` directive (or `allow` in Mozilla documentation) specifies fallback behavior for unspecified content.

CSP also includes a `frame-ancestors` directive to mitigate clickjacking, similar to the `X-Frame-Options` header.

#### Policy Violations

Violations of CSP result in failed subresource loads, failure to execute inline scripts, or inhibited page rendering. To ease deployment, CSP allows optional reporting of violations via the `report-uri` keyword. Policies can also be rolled out in a "soft" mode using the `X-Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header, where violations are reported but do not break the page.

#### Criticisms of CSP

Despite its benefits, CSP faces several criticisms:

- **Complexity and performance**: Retrofitting existing pages to work with CSP and the performance penalty of additional HTTP requests can be prohibitive.
- **Granularity**: The origin-level granularity of CSP rules may not be robust enough to defend against XSS, especially in complex domains hosting multiple applications.
- **Script injection**: Attackers can exploit JSONP APIs or other mechanisms to inject malicious scripts, even with CSP in place.

### Sandboxed Frames

Sandboxed frames are an extension of the `<iframe>` behavior, allowing the top-level page owner to impose additional restrictions on embedded documents. The goal is to make it safer to embed untrusted content like advertisements or gadgets on sensitive sites.

Sandboxed frames can be constrained by specifying the `sandbox` parameter on the `<iframe>` tag. By default, the embedded document cannot execute scripts or perform certain navigations. Permissions can be fine-tuned with keywords:

- **Allow-scripts**: Enables JavaScript execution.
- **Allow-forms**: Enables HTML form functionality.
- **Allow-top-navigation**: Allows the embedded page to navigate the top-level window.
- **Allow-same-origin**: Removes the synthetic origin and permits same-origin data access.

These restrictions help prevent DoS attacks, phishing, and other security issues.

### Conclusion

The evolution of cross-origin resource sharing and related security features like CSP and sandboxed frames reflects ongoing efforts to enhance web security. While these solutions offer significant improvements, they also face challenges in terms of complexity, performance, and robustness. Continued development and standardization will be crucial for addressing these issues and ensuring a secure web environment.
