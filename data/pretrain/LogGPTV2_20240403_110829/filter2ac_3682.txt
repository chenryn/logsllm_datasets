**ATT&CK ID:** M1050  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Exploit Protection

Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and its Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) feature can be utilized to block techniques that exploit trusted binaries to bypass application control. 

For clarity, the ASR rules help mitigate such attacks by restricting the execution of potentially malicious code through commonly exploited methods, thereby enhancing overall system security.
