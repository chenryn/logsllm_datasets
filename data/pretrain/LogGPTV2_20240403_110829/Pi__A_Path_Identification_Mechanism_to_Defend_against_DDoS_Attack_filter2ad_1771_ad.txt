Figure 8. Legacy Router Performance
routers cause marking holes to appear in the IP Identi-
ﬁcation ﬁeld of the packet. The reason for this is that a
legacy router will decrement the TTL of a packet, thus
shifting the marking index by one, but will not mark any-
thing into the ﬁeld. Thus, an unmarked n number of bits
is left in the packet. These holes can be harmlessly over-
written by Pi-enabled routers farther down the packet’s
path towards the victim, however, even in the n = 2
scheme, there are rarely enough marking routers in the
packet’s path for this to occur. More often, marking
holes make it to the victim, allowing the attacker to shift
between 2nl markings, where l is the number of holes
arriving at the victim.
In Figure 8 we show the affect of increasing the per-
cent of legacy routers in our sample topologies. We run
the same experiment as in the previous section, with the
n = 2 bit scheme and a 50% threshold value, only this
time we assign a probability p to each router in the topol-
ogy that it will function as a legacy router. If a router is
chosen as a legacy router, it acts as one for the entire sim-
ulation. We note that this uniform distribution of legacy
routers is unlikely to represent the true properties of in-
cremental deployment, since new routers implementing
our scheme will likely be deployed in clusters, and ini-
tially only in the core routers of the Internet. However, a
uniform distribution is actually more pessimistic in our
scheme, since a continuous path of non-legacy routers is
more likely to overwrite attacker generated random data
then a scattered group of them, which may simply over-
write each other.
The results in Figure 8 show that the acceptance gap
of the Pi ﬁlter is inversely proportional to the percent-
age of legacy routers in the topology. However, it is
clear from the graph that the Pi ﬁlter continues to pro-
vide some level of differentiation between user and at-
tacker packets, even when only 50% of the routers in
the sample topology actually participate in the marking
scheme.

We ﬁrst discuss general papers on network DoS.
Moore, Voelker, and Savage use backscatter packets (the
unsolicited responses that a DoS victim sends to the
spoofed IP address that it receives in the attack packet)
to gauge the level of Internet DoS activity [23]. Jung,
Krishnamurthy, and Rabinovich attempt to answer the
question of how a site can differentiate between a DoS
attack and a simple high load condition by analyzing
client request rates and ﬁle access patterns [18].
Many approaches for securing against DoS and
DDoS attacks are present in the literature. Early meth-
ods focused on detecting the ingress and egress points
of DoS trafﬁc within a single network administration.
Ferguson and Senie propose to deploy network ingress
ﬁltering to limit spooﬁng of the source IP address [13].
A more recent and functional approach to ingress ﬁl-
tering is proposed by Li et. al. in [19]. Their proto-
col, called SAVE, has routers construct tables of valid
source addresses per incoming interface, in much the
same way that they construct routing tables of desti-
nation addresses per interface. A packet whose source
address is out of the proper range is easily identiﬁed
and dropped. Stone proposes the CenterTrack mech-
anism, which uses routers capable of input debugging
(the ability to identify through which router interface a
particular packet was received) that would be virtually
connected through IP tunnels to all border routers on a
network [33]. When a node in the network comes un-

der attack, the overlay network is activated, and all bor-
der routers channel trafﬁc through the overlay routers.
These routers would use input debugging to tell from
which border router, and hence which neighboring net-
work, the DoS trafﬁc is coming from.
Burch and Cheswick present another scheme for path
tracing [4]. This unique scheme uses a limited form of
DoS attack to attack the exact path which the DoS trafﬁc
is traversing. By selectively exhausting select network
resources and monitoring the perturbations in the DoS
attack trafﬁc, it is possible to detect the links that a DoS
attack is traversing. Unfortunately, this method does not
scale well for the multiple attackers in a DDoS attack,
nor does it solve the problem of administrative coordi-
nation between ISPs.
None of the methods described previously relies on
the IP protocol to assist in protecting against DoS at-
tacks. A new class of protections seeks to modify parts
of the IP protocol itself to assist in ﬁnding the path of
DoS and DDoS trafﬁc. Early works in this category
suggest adding a new type of ICMP message:
