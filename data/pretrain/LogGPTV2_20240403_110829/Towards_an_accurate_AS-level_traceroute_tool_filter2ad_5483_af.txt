assigns the subnet 8.64.0.0/16 to its customer, AS D. Although AS
C has BGP routes for both preﬁxes, only the route for 8.0.0.0/8 is
propagated to AS B. Packets from AS B to the destination 8.64.0.1
would have a longest-matching preﬁx of 8.0.0.0/8 (with an AS path
of “B C” in the local BGP routing table). However, the forwarding
path would actually continue beyond AS C through one or more
hops in AS D. Whether these traceroute hops are mapped correctly
to AS D depends on whether the addresses of D’s interfaces (which
may or may not fall within the 8.64.0.0/16 block) are announced
into BGP and are seen from the vantage points where we collect
BGP routing tables.
Since many of our traceroute experiments do not traverse the
entire forwarding path to the destination, we may signiﬁcantly un-
dercount the cases where route aggregation results in a BGP AS
path that “ends early” relative to the forwarding path for destina-
tions in a smaller (unseen) subnet. Yet, across the three data sets,
extended traceroute AS paths still account for 18–22% of the mis-
matches with the BGP AS paths, as shown in Table 12. To test our
hypothesis that route aggregation is responsible for some of these
cases, we compare the AS-level forwarding paths for the two IP
addresses in each preﬁx (e.g., 8.0.0.1 and 8.64.0.1). Across all of
the preﬁxes where both forwarding paths are “complete,” the two
IP addresses have the same AS-level forwarding paths more than
99% of the time. However, when we focus on cases when either
(or both) of these IP addresses has an “extended” path, this num-
ber drops below 75%; in more than 20% of the cases, one address
has a forwarding AS path that matches the BGP AS path and the
other has an extended path. The differences in the pairs AS-level
forwarding paths are consistent with the effects of route aggrega-
tion/ﬁltering.
6.2 Interface Numbering at AS Boundaries
In practice,
Traceroute reports the IP addresses of interfaces rather than
interfaces to the same link are assigned
routers.
addresses from the same preﬁx (e.g.,
interfaces 192.0.2.157
and 192.0.2.158 forming a single point-to-point link with preﬁx
192.0.2.156/30). This introduces a potential problem for a link be-
tween two ASes—the interfaces are typically assigned an address
block belonging to one of the two ASes, not both. In some cases,
the path may enter and leave a router in some AS C where the two
hops have addresses “owned” by the adjacent ASes, such as B and
D, as shown in Figure 8. In this example, the traceroute AS path
appears to have a segment “B D” when the path actually traverses
a single router in AS C; in contrast, the “B C D” in the BGP AS
path is correct. As such, interface numbering at AS boundaries can
result in a traceroute AS path that has a “missing” AS hop when
AS B
AS C
AS D
Figure 8: Missing AS hop C due to interface numbering
compared to the corresponding BGP AS path. About 25–27% of
the remaining “mismatches” between the BGP and traceroute AS
paths stem from a single “missing” AS hop in the traceroute path,
as shown in Table 12; we speculate that interface numbering at AS
boundaries may be partially responsible.
To quantify these effects, we inspected cases where AS 7018
appeared as AS B, C, or D in a BGP path where the corresponding
segment of the traceroute path “B D.” AS 7018 never appeared as
AS D and appeared only once as AS C; as such, we focused our
attention on the case where AS 7018 corresponded to AS B. We
ﬁrst extracted the IP address of the last hop in the traceroute path
that mapped to AS 7018; then, we generated the IP address of the
other end of the link (e.g., converting 192.0.2.158 to 192.0.2.157)
and looked for an interface with this IP address in the conﬁguration
ﬁles from the same day. Then, we looked in the same conﬁguration
ﬁle to see if the interface was associated with a BGP session to
a neighboring domain; if so, we extracted the remote AS number
associated with this BGP session and compared it to the AS C in
the BGP AS path. In more than 97% of the cases, we found that
the last hop in AS 7018 was an interface associated with a BGP
session to AS C rather than AS D or any other AS. In Section 7,
we discuss how router-level graphs of the Internet [4, 5, 6] could
help resolve these kinds of ambiguities.
6.3 Outgoing Interface in ICMP Message
Traceroute “discovers” a hop along the forwarding path from the
source address of the ICMP TIME EXCEEDED message sent in
response to a TTL-limited probe. Ideally, the address corresponds
to the incoming interface where the packet entered the router. How-
ever, the ICMP RFC [28] does not explicitly state which IP address
the router should use.
In practice, some routers may assign the
source address based on the outgoing interface used to forward
the ICMP message back to the host initiating the traceroute [11].
Since routing is not necessarily symmetric, the interface receiving
the traceroute probe and the interface sending the ICMP message
are not always the same. When this happens, traceroute reports the
wrong forwarding path which can, at times, result in an incorrect
AS-level path. Figure 9 shows an example where the actual for-
warding path traverses ASes B and D, though traceroute reports an
incorrect hop that maps to AS C. This can result in a traceroute AS
path with “B C D” when the corresponding BGP path is simply “B
D.” About 9–13% of the remaining “mismatches” have a single ex-
tra AS hop in the traceroute AS path; we speculate that ambiguity
about the source IP address in the ICMP reply may be responsible
for some of these cases.
The work in [11] checked the source code for several IP
stacks and tested the behavior of a Cisco 7500 router; only the
Linux IP stack used the address of the outgoing interface in the
TIME EXCEEDED message. We evaluated several other popular
commercial routers and operating system versions in our test lab.
Routers using the address of the incoming interface included the
Cisco GSR (IOS 12.0(21)S3), Cisco 7200 (IOS 12.2.(10a)), Juniper
M10 (JunOS 5.3R2.4), and Avici TSR (4.2.1A); however, the Cisco
3660 running IOS 12.0(7)XK1 used the IP address of the outgo-

Figure 9: Extra AS hop C due to outgoing interface in ICMP
ing interface in its TIME EXCEEDED replies. From our tests and
the results in [11], we believe that the outgoing-interface problem
might affect some of the traceroute paths, particularly for hops in
smaller ASes that use lower-end routers. Determining whether this
phenomenon explains some of our “extra intermediate hop” cases
is difﬁcult in practice. Ultimately, additional active measurements
may be necessary to probe a suspicious router from multiple van-
tage points to infer its behavior.
6.4 Routing Anomalies
When the underlying route is changing, the “hops” returned by
traceroute do not necessarily represent a single path through the
network. This problem arises because each hop in the traceroute
output corresponds to a separate TTL-limited probe that might not
traverse the same forwarding path as the other probes sent toward
the destination. In our preprocessing, we eliminated traceroute ex-
periments where the corresponding BGP-level path was changing,
so we may not see as many cases where routing changes occur.
Still, the forwarding path may ﬂuctuate even if the BGP path does
not. Intradomain routing would tend not to alter the AS-level path
but we cannot dismiss this possibility entirely. In addition, the AS-
level forwarding path may change if some downstream AS experi-
ences a BGP routing change for some subnet of the advertised pre-
ﬁx. To increase our conﬁdence in the forwarding path, we could re-
peat the traceroute experiments in cases where the BGP and tracer-
oute AS paths disagree to make sure that transient changes in the
forwarding path are not to blame.
In addition, some routing anomalies can cause the forwarding
and signaling paths to differ even when both are stable. This can
arise due to “deﬂections,” where a router directs a packet to an in-
termediate node that has a different view of the “best” BGP route
for a destination. The work in [12] describes how certain internal
BGP (iBGP) conﬁgurations can be vulnerable to deﬂections; these
scenarios would be extremely difﬁcult for an operator to detect and
debug. In many cases, a deﬂection would not change the AS-level
path since the “best” AS path at different points in the network
might exit via the same neighboring AS. Still, in some cases the
two routers may pick different (equally good) best paths, such as
AS B selecting a path through AS C (e.g., “C E F”) at one peer-
ing point and a path through AS D (e.g., “D G F”) at another. In
such situations, deﬂections may cause the packets to traverse one
of these paths despite the router having a BGP table with the other
route. These kinds of anomalies could produce a variety of patterns
in how the BGP and traceroute AS path differ.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have proposed techniques for improving how
IP addresses of network infrastructure are mapped to the admin-
istering ASes. These techniques rely on a measurement method-
ology for (i) collecting both BGP and traceroute paths at multiple
vantage points and (ii) using an initial IP-to-AS mapping derived
from a large collection of BGP routing tables. We proposed sim-
ple heuristics for resolving traceroute paths with “*” and unmapped
IP-level hops and describe how to verify the results using internal
conﬁguration data. Then, we presented heuristics that compare the
BGP and traceroute AS paths to identify IXPs, sibling ASes, and
other ASes that “share” address space, and evaluated the improved
IP-to-AS mapping on traceroute paths collected from three vantage
points. Compared to an initial IP-to-AS mapping constructed from
the BGP tables, our heuristics reduced the fraction of incomplete
paths from 18–22% to 6–8%; the ratio of matched to mismatched
paths more than doubled, increasing from around 9–12 to 25–35.
The adjustments to the IP-to-AS mapping are crucial for building
an accurate AS-level traceroute tool for network operators and re-
searchers. In addition, the improved mapping helps in highlighting
the small number of important cases when the traceroute and BGP
AS paths actually differ.
Our techniques capitalize on certain operational realities which
arguably could change over time. For example, we were able to
include more than 99% of the BGP AS paths in our analysis be-
cause most BGP routes are relatively stable and few BGP AS paths
have private ASes or AS SETs. We also exploited the fact that
most ASes assign public, routable addresses to their equipment and
often give meaningful domain names to the interfaces. Although
quite a few traceroute hops did not return ICMP replies, most of
the “*” hops occurred near the ends of paths or between other hops
in the same AS. In addition, our techniques build on the assumption
that the AS-level signaling and forwarding paths typically (though
not always) match. This assumption would become less reason-
able if route ﬁltering were applied more aggressively in the core of
the Internet, or if routing anomalies such as deﬂections were very
common. Also, if the practice of “multi-homing without BGP”
becomes more common, the notion of “origin AS” would become
increasingly ambiguous. We plan to investigate the sensitivity of
our results to these factors.
Converting an IP-level path to an AS-level path is extremely dif-
ﬁcult, and additional measurement data would help. An accurate
router-level graph [18, 4, 5, 6] would allow us to map interfaces
to routers and, in turn, map routers to ASes. This would make our
techniques less vulnerable to the interface numbering at AS bound-
aries (Section 6.2) and the source IP address in ICMP messages
(Section 6.3). Although challenging in its own right, collecting the
router-level topology does not require joint collection of BGP up-
date messages, expanding the set of possible locations for launch-
ing the necessary traceroute probes. Our efforts would beneﬁt from
collecting both traceroute and BGP data at more locations, particu-
larly in Europe and Asia. We are working on expanding the number
and diversity of locations where we collect our data. Also, we are
exploring the use of the public traceroute servers despite the many
challenges they introduce. In particular, we are investigating ways
to reduce the amount of measurement data needed from each van-
tage point to lower the load we would impose on the public servers.
Ultimately, developing an accurate AS traceroute tool depends
on having a platform for collecting and managing information
about the Internet infrastructure. Having a generic distributed plat-
form, supported by service providers, for collecting and combining
the traceroute and BGP data would be extremely valuable. Going
one step further, computing the AS-level traceroute path would be
much easier if ASes kept an up-to-date list of the address blocks
used to number their equipment. This would simplify the interpre-
tation of the source addresses in the ICMP messages. ASes could
still protect access to their infrastructure from possible attack by
ﬁltering packets and routes that refer directly to their equipment.
Alternatively, the ICMP speciﬁcation could be extended to include
an AS number or other identifying information in ICMP replies.
In addition, the ICMP speciﬁcation could be augmented to clarify
whether the source address of the ICMP response messages refers
to the incoming or outgoing interface at the router.
In our ongoing research, we are working on a public-domain AS
traceroute tool that exploits our improved IP-to-AS mapping. We
plan to use the tool to develop techniques for real-time detection
and diagnosis of routing anomalies.
