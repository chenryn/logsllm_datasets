User: I have an app on Google App Engine, I used to deploy my application and see the deployed files and changes instantly.
But recently I have to wait about 5 minutes to see if the files are changed.
The only thing that I suspect is that I changed the application Zone. I am not sure what was the default Zone but now I set it to us-central1-a.
How can I solve this issue? I want to see all changes instantly as before.
Thanks!
Assistant: A common reason for not seeing your changes instantly after deploying is that you didn't change the application version. Instances with the same version will continue serving traffic until they die off, which could take a while. If instead you bump the default version, traffic will only be routed to instances that are funning the newer version of the code.
