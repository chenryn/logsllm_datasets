In "Basic Settings", fill in information such as the name of the load balancer and the listening port. 5. In Target Group, add target instances and ports to be load balanced. 6. In "Health Check", set the load balancer to detect the health status of the target instance. 7. In "Advanced Routing", you can set detailed routing rules such as path and request header. 8. Click "Create" and wait for the load balancer to be created. 9. Configure the security group and authorize the security group to allow the load balancer to access the backend instances. 10. Add the mapping of the load balancer in DNS to resolve the domain name to the IP address of the load balancer. 11. Verify the function of the load balancer and test whether the request can be correctly forwarded to the backend instance. Through the above steps, you can set up load balancing on AWS to achieve high availability. It should be noted that the setting steps and configuration items of different types of load balancers may be different. For specific operations, refer to the official AWS documentation to ensure correct and stable configuration.
