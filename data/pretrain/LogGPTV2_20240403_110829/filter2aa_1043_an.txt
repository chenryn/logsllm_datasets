4.3 Calculations for Interference Distance from a Single Radiating Device 
In this section, the distance “r”, at which a radiating device can cause a DTV receiver to 
reach the threshold of visibility (TOV) of artifacts on its screen, is calculated and 
resented. TOV is the starting point of inability of the receiver to resolve interference.  At 
ecause of the “cliff effect” 
that characterizes digital signal reception. 
All the test results and the corresponding calculations presented below represent the case 
of single undesired adjacent channel interference (in the range of N-15 to N+15) into the 
desired DTV channel. For performing the calculations, “DTV into DTV adjacent channel 
D/U ratios” (obtained by tests; Tables 4, 5, 9 and 10) are used. 
Tables 19 to 22 show the “D/U ratios @ TOV for adjacent channel DTV interference into 
DTV” for different conditions, the corresponding dBm values of the undesired DTV 
channel that causes TOV for the desired channel (obtained by subtracting D/U @ TOV 
from the dBm value of the desired signal), and the calculated values of “r”.  
As mentioned earlier, five different receivers (Rx. #1 to Rx. #5) are used and two cases of 
“fixed desired” and “fixed undesired” DTV channel conditions are considered. For the 
case of fixed desired, the desired DTV channel is taken to be Ch-32 and the undesired 
DTV channel is changed from Ch-17 to Ch-47 and is unfiltered. For the case of fixed 
undesired, the undesired DTV channel is filtered and is taken to be Ch-46 and the desired 
DTV channel is changed from Ch-61 to Ch-31.  
For each of the above two conditions (fixed desired and fixed undesired), the test results 
and the calculations are shown for the two cases of weak (-68 dBm) and 7 dB above Edge 
of DTV Contour (-76 dBm) desired DTV signal levels.  
In summary, the following four tables (19 to 22) are for: 
 Fixed desired, and an ATSC weak (–68 dBm) desired signal level (undesired 
signal not filtered) 
 Fixed desired, and a desired signal level at 7 dB above Edge of Contour Value ( –
76 dBm) (undesired signal not filtered) 
 Fixed undesired, and an ATSC weak (–68 dBm) desired signal level (undesired 
signal filtered) 
 Fixed undesired, and a desired signal level at 7 dB above Edge of Contour Value  
(–76 dBm)  (undesired signal filtered) 
p
any distance closer than “r” to the radiator where the interference to the DTV channel is 
higher, complete reception failure could be expected.  This is b
