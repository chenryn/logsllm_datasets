### 4.3 Calculations for Interference Distance from a Single Radiating Device

In this section, we calculate and present the distance "r" at which a radiating device can cause a DTV receiver to reach the threshold of visibility (TOV) of artifacts on its screen. TOV is the point at which the receiver begins to fail to resolve interference, due to the "cliff effect" that characterizes digital signal reception.

All the test results and corresponding calculations presented below represent the case of single undesired adjacent channel interference (in the range of N-15 to N+15) into the desired DTV channel. The calculations use "DTV into DTV adjacent channel D/U ratios" (obtained from tests; Tables 4, 5, 9, and 10).

Tables 19 to 22 show the "D/U ratios @ TOV for adjacent channel DTV interference into DTV" for different conditions, the corresponding dBm values of the undesired DTV channel that causes TOV for the desired channel (obtained by subtracting D/U @ TOV from the dBm value of the desired signal), and the calculated values of "r".

Five different receivers (Rx. #1 to Rx. #5) were used, and two cases of "fixed desired" and "fixed undesired" DTV channel conditions were considered:
- **Fixed Desired:** The desired DTV channel is Ch-32, and the undesired DTV channel is changed from Ch-17 to Ch-47 without filtering.
- **Fixed Undesired:** The undesired DTV channel is filtered and set to Ch-46, while the desired DTV channel is changed from Ch-61 to Ch-31.

For each of these two conditions, the test results and calculations are shown for the following desired DTV signal levels:
- Weak (-68 dBm)
- 7 dB above Edge of DTV Contour (-76 dBm)

The four tables (19 to 22) summarize the following scenarios:
1. Fixed desired, weak (-68 dBm) desired signal level (undesired signal not filtered)
2. Fixed desired, desired signal level at 7 dB above Edge of Contour Value (-76 dBm) (undesired signal not filtered)
3. Fixed undesired, weak (-68 dBm) desired signal level (undesired signal filtered)
4. Fixed undesired, desired signal level at 7 dB above Edge of Contour Value (-76 dBm) (undesired signal filtered)

At any distance closer than "r" to the radiator where the interference to the DTV channel is higher, complete reception failure can be expected.

### Assumptions and Parameters
- **Radiating Device:** A point radiator with 100-mW output power and 6-dBi gain, equivalent to a maximum radiated power of 400 mW (or 26 dBm).
- **Transmission Line:** The radiating device is connected to a transmission line with 0-dB loss and matched with the load.
- **Polarization:** The polarization of the incident wave is matched with the receiving antenna.
- **Receiving Antenna:** The DTV receiving antenna has 0-dBi gain.

### Detailed Results

The following tables present the detailed results for the five receivers under various conditions:

| Receiver | Undesired DTV Channel | Und. Level (dBm) | D/U (dB) | Dist. "r" (m) |
|----------|-----------------------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Rx. 1    | N-15                  | -13.2            | -54.8    | 4.4           |
|          | N-14                  | -30.2            | -37.8    | 31.1          |
|          | N-13                  | -12.7            | -55.3    | 4.1           |
| ...      | ...                   | ...              | ...      | ...           |
| Rx. 5    | N+12                  | -10.9            | -57.1    | 2.6           |
|          | N+13                  | ...              | ...      | ...           |

These tables provide the undesired signal level, D/U ratio, and the calculated distance "r" for each receiver and undesired DTV channel. The full tables (19 to 22) are available in the appendix for detailed reference.
