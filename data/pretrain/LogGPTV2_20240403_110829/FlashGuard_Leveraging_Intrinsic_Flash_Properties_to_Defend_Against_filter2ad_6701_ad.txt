**Figure 7:** The total size of the data encrypted by each ransomware family.

**Experimental Setup:**
- FIU for twenty days [49]
- Database workload traces of running TPC-C and TPC-E benchmarks for eight days [48]
- Storage traces of running IOZone benchmark for ten days [18]
- Storage traces of running the Postmark benchmark for ten days [29]

For each experiment, we first run 50 million mixed read and write operations to warm up the system, then replay each trace to collect performance results.

### 6.2 Data Recovery Efficiency

FlashGuard follows the recovery procedures discussed in ยง 5.4. After the recovery process, we manually verify the pages read from the flash device. All original versions of the encrypted data are found in the recovered flash pages. Figure 7 displays the average size of the data recovered from different ransomware families, ranging from 0.2 GB to 4.1 GB.

**Figure 8:** The time required to restore data encrypted by ransomware.

The execution time for restoring encrypted data ranges from 4.2 seconds to 49.6 seconds, as shown in Figure 8. FlashGuard leverages the internal parallelism of the flash device to access retained invalid pages in parallel. Note that the recovery time is not proportional to the victim data size, as the retained invalid pages are not evenly distributed across the parallel elements (chip-level packages) in the flash device. However, the current recovery approach used in FlashGuard is significantly faster than the naive approach, which scans the entire flash device (taking 707.7 seconds).

Most ransomware samples do not frequently read and overwrite user data, so FlashGuard can quickly reconstruct the original files. Even if encryption ransomware targets SSD properties, such as reading and overwriting user data, FlashGuard can still restore the encrypted data by retaining all older versions.

### 6.3 Impact on Storage Performance

To evaluate the impact of FlashGuard on storage performance, we start with the default over-provisioning (15% of the SSD's full capacity) and run acknowledged storage traces collected from real-world applications (see Table 3). We assume all writes are encrypted, meaning all invalid pages that have been read will be retained in the SSD. The retention time for these invalid pages ranges from 2 days to 20 days. Storage latency and throughput are reported in Figures 9 and 10.

For most workloads, the average latency of running them on FlashGuard is almost the same as on an unmodified SSD, as shown in Figure 9. For I/O-intensive workloads like Postmark, TPCC, and TPCE, FlashGuard increases the average latency by up to 6.1%. As the retention time for invalid pages increases, the average latency slightly increases. In terms of I/O throughput, FlashGuard has a minimal impact, as shown in Figure 10. For I/O-intensive workloads, the average throughput drops by up to 0.6%.

FlashGuard introduces minimal performance overhead for several reasons:
1. According to our statistical study on various real-world storage traces collected over six to twenty days (see Figure 11), only a small portion (4.1% on average) of storage operations have I/O patterns similar to those of encryption ransomware. Thus, FlashGuard retains only a small amount of invalid pages for regular applications.
2. The RFTL in FlashGuard delays GC execution on flash blocks with retained invalid pages, reducing the chances of moving these pages.
3. GC is executed in the background, allowing FTLs to schedule GC during the idle time of the flash controller, further reducing performance interference.
4. Existing I/O schedulers and FTLs provide efficient GC for many workloads. When all pages on a flash block are invalid, the block is erased without any page movement. In FlashGuard, no additional page movement is required for a flash block with all retained invalid pages.

- **Figure 10:** Average throughput of running real-world workloads with FlashGuard vs. Unmodified SSD.

**Figure 12:**
Average I/O latency of running various real-world workloads on FlashGuard compared to an unmodified SSD. Increasing the over-provisioning ratio from 15% (default) to 20% and 30% slightly decreases the average latency for both unmodified SSD and FlashGuard, as storage capacity is traded for performance. In terms of storage throughput, FlashGuard introduces minimal overhead.
