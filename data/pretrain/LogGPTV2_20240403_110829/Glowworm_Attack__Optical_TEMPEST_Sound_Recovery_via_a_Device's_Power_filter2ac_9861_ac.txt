4.2 Exploring the Optical Response
Here we explore the recovered optical signal, including the baseline,
side effects added, and SNR (signal-to-noise ratio).
4.2.1 Characterizing the Optical Signal When No Sound Is Played
Here we examine the characteristics of the optical signal when no
sound is played.
Experimental Setup: We obtained five seconds of optical measure-
ments via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator
LED of four devices.
Results: The FFT graphs extracted from the optical measurements
of the devices when no sound was played are presented in Fig. 5.
As can be seen, a peak appears in the FFT at around 100 Hz; this
peak is the result of the power line frequency used to supply power
to the LED. Power lines are designed to operate at frequencies
of 50 or 60 Hz, however certain types of loads contain nonlinear
components such as diodes and transistors, and as a result, the
loads produce frequencies which are multiples of the fundamental
power line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) and are called power system
harmonics. Since a diode bridge is integrated into the LED, it distorts
the fundamental power line frequency, resulting in power system
harmonics (50 Hz, 100 Hz, 200 Hz, etc.) that are reflected in the
LED’s light intensity. Since the optical signal is obtained via an
electro-optical sensor directed at a device’s power indicator LED,
the frequency of 50 Hz and its harmonics (100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz,
etc.) are added to the raw optical signal and are not the result of
the sound we wish to recover.
Conclusions: The power system harmonics, which are added to
the optical signal and are not the result of the sound played, need
to be filtered in order to recover the played signal.
4.2.2 Power Indicator LED’s Response to Sound at 0-4 KHz In the
next experiments, we tested the response of the power indicator
LED of various devices to a wide range of frequencies.
Experimental Setup: We conducted the following experiments:
In the first experiment, we obtained optical measurements from
the power indicator LED of two speakers (Logitech S120 speakers
and Winner speakers) that were connected to the electricity. In the
second experiment, we obtained optical measurements from the
power indicator LED of devices (TP-Link UE330 USB hub splitter
[10], MIRACASE MHUB500 USB hub splitter [6], RP) that were
used to provide power to the speakers via their USB input ports.
In each of the experiments, the audio was played via speakers at a
sound level of 70 dB. The audio played from the speakers is a 30
second audio file that consists of a chirp function (a frequency scan
between 0-4 KHz).
Results: Fig. 6 presents the spectrograms obtained from the opti-
cal measurements. Three observations can be made from the spec-
trograms: (1) For some devices, the signal that appears in the optical
measurements is much stronger (e.g., Logitech S120 speakers) than
that of other devices (e.g., the RP). (2) For some devices, the signal
obtained matches the original chirp function (e.g., Winner speakers).

essential frequency bands used for speech recovery. Based on the
experiments we conducted, we consider an SNR over 40 dB as a
high quality signal; an SNR between 20 and 40 dB as a medium
quality signal; and an SNR below 20 dB as a low quality signal. The
following observations can be made based on the results: (1) The
SNR changes depending on the type of device used.
This is the result of the differences in their power consumption
and the intensity of the light emitted from their power indicator
LED. (2) For some devices, the SNR has a low standard deviation
(STD) throughout the spectrum examined (e.g., the STD of the SNR
of the optical signal obtained from the Logitech S120 speakers is
7.5, and the STD of the SNR of the optical signal obtained from the
Winner speakers is 5.6), which indicates a stable response, while for
other devices, the SNR has a large STD (e.g., RP), which is usually
the result of a decrease in the SNR as a function of the frequency. (3)
For some devices, the effective spectrum that can be used to recover
sound is narrow. For example, the SNR obtained from the power
indicator LED of the MIRACASE MHUB500E is only stable up to
1000 Hz; for this device, the SNR of the spectrum beyond 1000 Hz is
extremely unstable. (4) In general, the SNR of the recovered signal
improves as the sound level increases. This phenomenon can be
explained as follows: When the volume of the sound played by the
speakers increases, the power consumption increases. The power is
the product of voltage and current. The current consumed from AC-
DC converter output stage capacitors (which have a limited amount
of energy) increases, and as a result, the voltage level decreases
proportionally to the current and volume levels. Since a device’s
power indicator LED is connected in parallel to the capacitor, it
is linearly affected by voltage levels; its intensity also increases,
and a greater amount of light is emitted. As a result, more photons
are captured by the electro-optical sensor, which yields a better
SNR. (5) The improvement in the SNR that results from higher
volume levels varies depending on the device; in some cases, the
improvement is significant (e.g., the TP-Link USB hub splitter and
Figure 5: FFT graphs extracted from optical measurements
of the power indicator LED of various devices when no
sound was played. The frequency of the LED (100 Hz) can
be seen in the graph for each device.
(3) For some devices, only the first harmonic of the chirp appears
in the spectrogram (e.g., TP-Link USB hub splitter).
Conclusions: Based on these experiments, we concluded that: (1)
For devices with a weak recovered optical signal, the application of
denoising techniques is required to optimize the SNR. (2) For devices
where the recovered optical signal appears in the first harmonic,
the use of downtuning is required.
Next, we conducted an experiment to calculate the SNR of each
of the seven devices (Logitech S120 speakers, Winner speakers,
TP-Link UE330 USB hub splitter, MIRACASE MHUB500 USB hub
splitter, RP, Google Nest Mini, and Creative Pebble speakers) across
the 0-4 kHz spectrum at two levels (60 and 70 dB).
Experimental Setup: We used the same experimental setup as
the previous experiment, however this time we played a different
audio file which consists of various sine waves (120, 170,....1020 Hz),
where each sine wave was played separately for two seconds. We
played the audio file via the the speakers at two sound levels (60
and 70 dB) and obtained optical measurements.
Results: The SNR is presented in Fig. 7 and Table 1. We used
the SNR as a measure in order to assess Glowworm’s to capture

a chirp function was played (frequency scan between 0-4 KHz). Note that in some devices (e.g., Logitech S120 speakers) the
original frequency played by the speakers appears in the spectrum of the optical signal, while in other cases (e.g., TP-Link
UE330, MIRACASE MHUB500), only the first harmonic of the frequency appears in the spectrum of the optical signal.

RP), while in other cases (e.g., Winner speakers), the improvement
is less dramatic. (6) For some vulnerable devices (e.g., Google Nest
Mini and Creative Pebble speakers), the SNR is poor due to the
weak intensity of their power indicator LED. This fact requires
more sensitive electro-optical sensor (with lower noise level) to
recover sound from their power indicator LED.
Conclusions: Based on these experiments, we concluded that (1)
a sound level of 70 dB (the sound level of virtual meetings) produces
a high SNR, and (2) for devices in which the SNR decreases as a
function of the frequency, an equalizer needs to be used to amplify
the energy of weak frequency ranges.
4.2.3 The Influence of Ambient Light In the next experiment we
investigate the influence of ambient light in the LED’s environment
on the SNR calculated from the optical signal obtained.
Experimental Setup: An electro-optical sensor was directed at the
power indicator LED of speakers (Logitech S120 speakers) from a
distance of five meters. The electro-optical sensor obtained measure-
ments from the speakers’ power indicator LED while the speakers
played various sine waves (120, 170,....1020 Hz). This setup was
repeated twice: (1) when the lights were on, and (2) when the lights
were off.
Results: The SNR is presented in Fig. 8. As can be seen, the effect
of ambient light on the SNR calculated from the optical signal is
negligible, and no additional procedures are required. This is due to
the fact that the ambient light only adds its power system harmonics
to the spectrum of the optical signal, and the harmonics can be
filtered early in the processing stage.
Conclusion: Ambient light present in the power indicator LED’s
environment does not affect Glowworm’s ability to recover sound.
5 Optical-Acoustic Transformation
In this section, we leverage the findings presented in Section 4
and present optical-acoustic transformation (OAT), which we used
to recover audio signals from the optical signals obtained from
