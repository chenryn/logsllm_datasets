I'm curious about how to copy the permissions from one directory to another. Do you have any suggestions?

Thank you.

**Response:**

To copy the permissions from one directory to another, you can use the `cp` command with the `-a` (archive) option. This will preserve the original directory's permissions, ownership, timestamps, and other attributes. The command would look like this:

```bash
cp -a from_directory to_directory
```

This will ensure that the target directory (`to_directory`) maintains the same permissions as the source directory (`from_directory`).

Let me know if you need further assistance!
