User: What is Monitoring? Why is it very important in IT operation and maintenance? Please list a few common monitoring indicators.
Assistant: Monitoring refers to the real-time or periodic monitoring and recording of systems, services or applications in order to detect and correct problems in time to ensure system stability and high availability. In IT operation and maintenance, monitoring is very important because it can: 1. Improve system reliability: Monitoring can help operation and maintenance personnel discover potential problems in the system and take timely measures to prevent problems from expanding. 2. Improve system performance: By monitoring resource utilization, operation and maintenance personnel can understand system bottlenecks and performance problems, and take measures to optimize them. 3. Guarantee the normal operation of the business: monitoring can detect and eliminate problems affecting the business in a timely manner, ensuring business continuity and stability. Common monitoring indicators include: 1. CPU utilization: refers to the percentage of CPU usage. High CPU utilization can mean that the system is heavily loaded and needs to be optimized. 2. Memory utilization: refers to the percentage of memory that has been occupied in the system. High memory utilization may cause system crashes or application exceptions. 3. Disk space utilization: refers to the ratio of the used disk space to the total disk space. Low disk space may prevent applications from working properly. 4. Network traffic: refers to the transmission speed of data packets in the network. High network traffic may cause network congestion, affecting the normal operation of applications or systems. 5. Response time: Refers to the time it takes for a service or application to respond to a request. Excessive response times can affect user experience and reduce system availability.
