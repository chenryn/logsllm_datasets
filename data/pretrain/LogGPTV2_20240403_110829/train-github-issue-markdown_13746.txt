**Current behavior**  
Templates complain when the object "can be null" and they don't accept using
typescript's `!` not null caster. The way to do this is by using `?` instead
which is inconsistent.
**Expected behavior**  
Angular templates should accept `!` like if it was `?`
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
    {{ video.getSnippet().getTitle() }}
resulted in error "Object is possibly 'null'."
    {{ video.getSnippet()!.getTitle() }}
resulted in Error: Template parse errors:  
Parser Error: Unexpected token '!' at column 23 in [{{
video.getSnippet()!.getTitle() }}]
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Consistency
