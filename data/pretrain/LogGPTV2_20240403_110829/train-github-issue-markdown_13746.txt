**Current Behavior**
When an object in a template can be `null`, TypeScript's non-null assertion operator (`!`) is not accepted. Instead, the optional chaining operator (`?`) must be used, which introduces inconsistency.

**Expected Behavior**
Angular templates should accept the non-null assertion operator (`!`) in the same way they accept the optional chaining operator (`?`).

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions**
1. The following template expression:
   ```html
   {{ video.getSnippet().getTitle() }}
   ```
   results in the error: "Object is possibly 'null'."

2. Using the non-null assertion operator:
   ```html
   {{ video.getSnippet()!.getTitle() }}
   ```
   results in a parser error: 
   ```
   Template parse errors:  
   Parser Error: Unexpected token '!' at column 23 in [{{
   video.getSnippet()!.getTitle() }}]
   ```

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior**
The motivation for this change is to ensure consistency in handling potentially `null` values in Angular templates. This would align the behavior of the non-null assertion operator (`!`) with the optional chaining operator (`?`), making the syntax more intuitive and consistent.
