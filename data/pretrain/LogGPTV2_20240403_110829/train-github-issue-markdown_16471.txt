followup to #17165 / #18738, cc @kshyatt
right now the base tests are printing both old as-you-go info, in addition to
a new table so it looks like
         * dsp                   maxrss 3501.18 MB
         * examples              maxrss 3501.18 MB
         * compile               maxrss 3501.18 MB
    Test Summary: |     Pass  Broken     Total
      Overall     | 22171317      28  22171345
    Test:                 | Total time (s): | GC time (s): | Percent in gc: | Allocated (MB): | RSS (MB):
    linalg/triangular     |  546.77         |   11.92      |    2.18        | 8420.77         |  680.38
    linalg/qr             |   89.66         |    1.85      |    2.06        | 2312.61         |  751.55
I propose we get rid of the old style and attempt to make the table just print
new rows as they come in, if that's possible. The maxrss numbers are the same
so it's duplicated information.
Additional printing-related followup from #17165 (comment), printing of `@test
true` or `@test 1==1` should be adjusted to not bother showing `Expression:
nothing` now that passing tests don't save the input expressions any more.
