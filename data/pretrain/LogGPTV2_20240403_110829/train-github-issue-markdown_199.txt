Running unit tests in non-Chrome browsers has raised concerns regarding the current API used in the Date and Currency pipes. Specifically, this API is not fully supported across all versions of Safari (both desktop and mobile) and in older browsers. For more details, please refer to the following resources:
- [MDN Web Docs: Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)
- [Can I Use: Intl](http://caniuse.com/#search=intl)

Even on browsers that do support the API, the results often differ from those produced by Chrome. For instance:
- In Firefox, one of the tests triggers a known bug that has been open for two years: [Mozilla Bugzilla #866372](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866372).
- In Internet Explorer 11, most tests fail due to inconsistencies in output, such as formatting, whitespace, and special characters.

In summary, the API appears to be reliable only in Chrome, and it is also challenging to polyfill. If anyone has a viable solution to address these issues, please share your insights.
