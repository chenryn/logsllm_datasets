User: I want to do the following:
If the bash/python script is launched from a terminal, it shall do something such as printing an error message text. If the script is launched from GUI session like double-clicking from a file browser, it shall do something else, e.g. display a GUI message box.
Assistant: It can check the value of $DISPLAY to see whether or not it's running under X11, and $(tty) to see whether it's running on an interactive terminal. if [[ $DISPLAY ]] && ! tty; then chances are good you'd want to display a GUI popup.
