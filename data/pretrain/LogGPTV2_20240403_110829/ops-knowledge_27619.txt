User: I have a server running nginx + UWSGI + python. UWSGI is running as a daemon with the flag set: --daemonize /var/log/uwsgi.log which logs all application errors.
I've noticed that on error if I use a python print statement it will write to the log but only on an error. The standard python logging library doesn't seem to affect the log in any situation.
How do I point the python logging libraries to use the UWSGI log?
Assistant: use logging.StreamHandler as logging handler
