You can find a sample on the Bootstrap website by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Bootstrap JavaScript Modals page](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals).
2. Click on "Launch demo modal."
3. Scroll down within the modal and click "Close."
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3.
5. On the second attempt, you will notice that the modal does not close when you click "Close." However, pressing the `ESC` key will still close the modal.

This issue demonstrates an inconsistency in the modal's closing behavior.
