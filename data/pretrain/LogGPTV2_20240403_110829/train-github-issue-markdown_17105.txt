It seems like you are having trouble with an HTML code snippet, and the image link provided is not rendering correctly. To better assist you, please provide the specific HTML code that you are working with. Additionally, ensure that the image URL is accessible and properly formatted. Hereâ€™s a general example of how to include an image in HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Image Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <img src="https://example.com/path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</body>

```
