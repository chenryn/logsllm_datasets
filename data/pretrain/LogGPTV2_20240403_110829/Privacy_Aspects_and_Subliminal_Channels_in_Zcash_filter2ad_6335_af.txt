### Experimental Results

To provide experimental results for the stochastic model presented in Section 4, we gathered relevant statistics from the Zcash blockchain. We first investigated the Sapling shielded transaction set to understand the typical number of shielded inputs and outputs in a shielded transaction. Second, we analyzed public blockchain data to estimate fingerprint survival probabilities.

#### Notation

For clarity, we introduce a notation to describe transactions based on their number of shielded and transparent inputs and outputs. A Zcash transaction is denoted as:
\[
(sin \cdot tin | sout \cdot tout)
\]
where \(sin\) and \(sout\) are the number of shielded inputs and outputs, respectively, and \(tin\) and \(tout\) are the number of transparent inputs and outputs.

Transactions are categorized into three types based on the number of shielded and transparent inputs or outputs:
- **t-to-z**: \(tin \geq 1\) and \(sout \geq 1\) with a negative balance value (hiding)
- **z-to-z**: \(sin \geq 1\), \(sout \geq 1\), and \(tin = tout = 0\) (fully shielded)
- **z-to-t**: \(sin \geq 1\) and \(tout \geq 1\) with a positive balance value (revealing)

Examples include:
- \((0 \cdot 1 | 1 \cdot 0)\) is a hiding t-to-z transaction with 1 transparent input and 1 shielded output.
- \((1 \cdot 0 | 2 \cdot 0)\) is a fully shielded z-to-z transaction with 1 shielded input and 2 shielded outputs.
- \((2 \cdot 0 | 1 \cdot 1)\) is a partially revealing z-to-t transaction with 2 shielded inputs and 1 shielded and 1 transparent output.

#### Sapling Transactions Dataset

Our dataset includes all hiding, fully shielded, and revealing Sapling transactions from block 419,200 (mined October 29, 2018) to block 472,285 (mined January 29, 2019).

The distribution of these transactions is summarized in Table 2, row "All." To focus on transactions that are more likely to occur as coin transfers between non-miner users, we removed the following transactions from our dataset:
- **Mining activities**: Miners transfer rewards to shielded addresses, creating many hiding and revealing transactions. Using heuristics, we identified 6,827 hiding t-to-z and 5,718 revealing z-to-t transactions.
- **Direct unique value matches**: Where a hiding transaction is directly followed by a revealing transaction with the same unique value. We found 37 such transactions.
- **1-Hop fingerprint matches**: Paths where a hiding transaction with a unique value is followed by a revealing transaction with a unique value, with a value difference of 10,000 Zatoshis (standard transaction fee). We found 676 such transactions.
- **Small value transactions**: We observed 2,436 t-to-z transactions with total transparent value less than 1 ZEC each, and only 286 z-to-t transactions with an overall value lower than 1 ZEC. These small value spends are likely collected and combined with higher value ones before being transferred to a transparent address. We excluded 2,436 small value t-to-z and 314 z-to-t transactions.

After these removals, our final dataset consists of 1,613 t-to-z, 1,570 fully shielded, and 1,633 revealing transactions. The distribution of different types of transactions in the final dataset is reported in Table 3.

Assuming all t-to-z transactions are independent, we can approximate the average number of transaction-hops \(Zlen\) for a generic path in the shielded pool as the ratio between the sum of all transactions with at least one shielded input and one shielded output and all t-to-z transactions. We obtained \(Zlen \approx 1.42\).

A path in the shielded pool goes through transaction-hops with at least one shielded input and one shielded output. In Table 4, we report the most frequent types of these transactions (≈ 95.8%) along with their distribution and corresponding survival probability of good fingerprints observed in all public blockchain data.

Given a transaction \((sin \cdot tin | sout \cdot tout)\) in the shielded pool, the corresponding survival probability of a good fingerprint is equal to the fingerprint survival probability observed in the transparent transaction of the same input-output degree \((0 \cdot sin + tin | 0 \cdot sout + tout)\) multiplied by the probability that the fee ends with 4 zeroes (≈ 96.8%).

Similarly, we report in Table 5 the relative distribution and survival fingerprint probabilities for the most frequent exit nodes (≈ 96.9%), i.e., revealing z-to-t transactions.

Given a path \(x = x1 - ... - xn - xn+1 \in ZPaths(n + 1)\), where \(x1, ..., xn\) are transactions inside the shielded pool and \(xn+1\) is a revealing transaction, it is straightforward to estimate both \(P(FP | x)\) and \(P(x)\), and ultimately, \(P(FP)\).

Assuming each transaction is independent and considering only paths made by the most frequent types of transactions, we have:
\[
P(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{n+1} p(xi) \cdot (0.958^n \cdot 0.969)
\]
where \(p(xi)\) denotes the probability of having a transaction type equal to \(xi\), as reported in Tables 4 and 5. Similarly,
\[
P(FP | x) = \prod_{i=1}^{n+1} pFP(xi)
\]
where \(pFP(xi)\) denotes the fingerprint survival probability for transaction \(xi\), also reported in Tables 4 and 5.

Letting \(ZPaths'(n + 1) \subset ZPaths(n + 1)\) be the set of paths consisting of the most frequent transaction types reported in Tables 4 and 5, and modeling \(P(Z = n) = \frac{Zlen^n \cdot e^{-n}}{n!}\) by a Poisson distribution with parameter \(Zlen\), we obtain an estimation for the overall fingerprint survival probability as:
\[
P(FP) \approx \sum_{n=0}^k \frac{Zlen^n \cdot e^{-n}}{n!} \cdot \sum_{x \in ZPaths'(n+1)} P(FP | x) \cdot P(x)
\]
Letting \(k = 5\), we obtained \(P(FP) \approx 16.6\%\).
