Per this convo.
When I perform the following (on `macos x86_64 v1.20.4`),
  1. run `RUST_BACKTRACE=1 deno` to open a REPL, then
  2. enter `console.log(String.fromCharCode(55296))` and press enter
deno panics and outputs the following backtrace:
    thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Error("unexpected end of hex escape", line: 1, column: 101)', /private/tmp/deno-20220406-92106-p4p5kp/deno/core/inspector.rs:724:66
    stack backtrace:

    note: Some details are omitted, run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` for a verbose backtrace.
According to other folks on Discord, the same behavior happens for other
architectures.
