Challenge Waypoint: Local Scope and Functions has an issue.

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
    function myFunction() {
      var myVar = "loo";
      console.log(myVar);
    }
    myFunction();
    // run and check the console 
    // myVar is not defined outside of myFunction
    // now remove the console.log line to pass the test
checker responds:
    Remove the second console log
That's what's causing the issue, when the line is removed checker returns
success:
    // now remove the console.log line to pass the test
So it may be optimal to do it like this:
    function myFunction() {
      var myVar = "loo";
      console.log(myVar);
    }
    myFunction();
    // run and check the console 
    // myVar is not defined outside of myFunction
    console.log(myVar); // now remove this whole line to pass the test
By the way, commenting second console log line produces checker error also,
but this is probably known, because of instructions to remove the line to pass
the test.
