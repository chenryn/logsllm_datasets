User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Setting up https with a self-signed certificate on Apache I'm trying to set up HTTPS on Apache, using a self-signed certificate. But instead of displaying the page, I get a bunch of weird errors. An a different error from each browser!

From Chrome: 


  Error 2 (net::ERR_FAILED): Unknown error.


From Firefox: 


  SSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length.
  (Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long)


I followed the steps detailed on http://slacksite.com/apache/certificate.php, as well as about 4 other guides. They are all about the same, but all give the same result. So I must be doing something wrong.

Briefly, here's what I did:


Generate the server key: 

openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
Generate CSR: 

openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr


[while generating the request, I was careful to enter my actual hostname as the "Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname)"]


remove password from key: 

cp server.key server.key.org
openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
Self-sign the certificate:

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
Configured apache to point at those files, and use those certificates.


Any ideas?

UPDATE: Here's my virtual host configuration:

LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
Listen 443
#   Some MIME-types for downloading Certificates and CRLs
#
AddType application/x-x509-ca-cert .crt
AddType application/x-pkcs7-crl    .crl
SSLSessionCache         shmcb:/var/cache/mod_ssl/scache(512000)
SSLSessionCacheTimeout  300
SSLMutex default
SSLRandomSeed startup file:/dev/urandom  256
SSLRandomSeed connect builtin
SSLCryptoDevice builtin

Assistant: The issue is more likely to lie with your vhost configuration.

The ssl_error_rx_record_too_long error can be produced by initiating an HTTPS session against an HTTP resource. Such as - https://host.name:80.
