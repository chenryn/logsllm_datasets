User: In order to redeploy a GAE application, I currently have to install the GAE deployment tools on the system that I am using for deployment. While this process is relatively straight forward, the deployment process is a manual process that does not work from behind a firewall and the deployment tools must be installed on every machine that will be used for updating GAE apps. A more ideal solution would be if I could update a GAE application from another GAE application that I have deployed previously. This would remove the need to have multiple systems configured to deploy apps. 
Since the GAE deployment tools are written in Python and the GAE App Engine supports Python, is it possible to modify appcfg.py to work from within GAE? The use case would be to pull a project from GitHub or some other online repository and update one GAE application from another GAE app. If this is not possible, what is the limiting constraint?
Assistant: One limiting constraint could be the protocol that the python sdk uses to communicate with the GAE servers.  If it only uses HTTP, you might be OK.  but if it's anything else, you might be out of luck because you can't open a socket directly from within GAE.
