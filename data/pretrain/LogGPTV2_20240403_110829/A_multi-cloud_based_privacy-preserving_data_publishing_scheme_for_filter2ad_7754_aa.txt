ABSTRACT
With the increased popularity of ubiquitous computing and
connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT) also introduces
new vulnerabilities and attack vectors. While secure data
collection (i.e.
the upward link) has been well studied in
the literature, secure data dissemination (i.e. the downward
link) remains an open problem. Attribute-based encryp-
tion (ABE) and outsourced-ABE has been used for secure
message distribution in IoT, however, existing mechanisms
suﬀer from extensive computation and/or privacy issues. In
this paper, we explore the problem of privacy-preserving tar-
geted broadcast in IoT. We propose two multi-cloud-based
outsourced-ABE schemes, namely the parallel-cloud ABE
and the chain-cloud ABE, which enable the receivers to par-
tially outsource the computationally expensive decryption
operations to the clouds, while preventing user attributes
from being disclosed. In particular, the proposed solution
protects three types of privacy (i.e., data, attribute and ac-
cess policy privacy) by enforcing collaborations among mul-
tiple clouds. Our schemes also provide delegation veriﬁa-
bility that allows the receivers to verify whether the clouds
have faithfully performed the outsourced operations. We
extensively analyze the security guarantees of the proposed
mechanisms and demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency
of our schemes with simulated resource-constrained IoT de-
vices, which outsource operations to Amazon EC2 and Mi-
crosoft Azure.

grid (e.g., load balancing, smart pricing), smart cities (e.g.,
smart traﬃc control, distributed pollution monitoring), etc.

Internet of Things (IoT) materializes a vision of a future In-
ternet that utilizes the sensing and computing capabilities of
various devices to facilitate interaction of humans with envi-
ronment. This has led to the emergence of new categories of
applications with impact across industries, businesses, and
ultimately, end users.
The charm of IoT lies in its capability of interconnecting
various sensing devices with varying computation and com-
munication capacity to the Internet. For example, connect-
ing millions of sensors and smart meters to the utilities and
power plants makes the aging power grid “smart”. The two-
way communication capability not only facilitates utilities to
collect a variety of real-time, ﬁne-grained data (e.g., power
consumption, voltage, phase angle) from smart meters, but
also enables them to publish important messages (e.g., con-
trol commands, dynamic prices) to smart devices [23]. Sim-
ilarly, the success of wearable devices and e-health depends
not only on the real-time data sensing and reporting, but
also on the timely reaction (e.g., ﬁrmware upgrade, param-
eter adjustment) and value-added services (e.g., customized
healthy living tips, targeted advertisements) from healthcare
service providers and third parties [3]. For example, consider
the high risk of heart attacks in extremely hot weather, it
is a desirable feature for a wearable device manufacturer to
send control messages to devices to increase the measure-
ment frequency of blood pressure and oxygen saturation for
elder users with heart diseases and overweight issues.
Nevertheless, with all devices connected and using the In-
ternet infrastructure for data exchange, IoT and its two-way
communication expose a new attack surface to adversaries,
which makes it susceptible to various security and privacy
issues. Consider the tremendous loss due to system failures
and attacks, such as power outage and patient data breach,
security and privacy has become one of the most important
aspects in the design and deployment of IoT applications.
Various schemes have been proposed to secure IoT commu-
nication and data exchange, which span over a variety of
topics including but not limited to privacy-preserving data
collection [18, 21], detection and prevention of false data
injection [17, 20, 14, 27], patient monitoring [25, 22], etc.
However, most of the attention has been concentrated on
secure data collection, which considers only one direction
(i.e., the upward link) of the two-way communication. Lit-
tle work has been done to secure the other direction (i.e.,
the downward link), where messages are pushed to millions
of end devices, neglecting the fact that data along this di-
rection sometimes contains sensitive information, such as
system parameters, user-speciﬁc prices and healthcare in-
30
formation, and thus needs an enhanced protection.
Conventionally, to securely publish data to a speciﬁc tar-
get group, the sender (e.g., a control center in smart grid or
a value-added service provider in an e-health system) sends
data in an encrypted form to each device in a unicast man-
ner. Given the huge number of devices in IoT applications,
this will incur a large communication and computation over-
head [13] as well as a high complexity for key management.
To alleviate the overhead, approaches based on broadcast
encryption have been proposed to encrypt the message for
an arbitrary set of receivers so that only members of the
target group can recover its content. However, solutions
based on conventional broadcast encryption [10, 7] require
the sender to store key materials for all recipients and incur
a storage requirement for the sender. This makes them im-
practical for IoT applications with a huge number of receiv-
ing devices. Besides, in the conventional broadcast encryp-
tion, all members in the broadcast set need to be notiﬁed of
the change [7], which incurs a non-negligible communication
overhead to support the incremental growth of the number
of users. Therefore, neither option is particularly appealing
in the context of IoT.
A more promising solution is to encrypt the message ac-
cording to common characteristics that specify a set of users
as the qualiﬁed recipients. For example, recipients can be
categorized by their geographical locations such as “users in
San Francisco”. Bethencourt et al. proposed the concept of
ciphertext policy (CP-ABE) [4], which is conceptually sim-
ilar to role-based access control but more ﬁne-grained and
ﬂexible. In the CP-ABE model, a user is associated with a
set of attributes reﬂected in her secret key and the access
policies, which deﬁne the attributes that an authorized user
should own, are embedded in the ciphertext. The sender en-
crypts a message under an access policy so that only autho-
rized users with attributes satisfying the access policy can
decrypt the message. The ABE schemes enable a sender to
deﬁne dynamic access policies without knowing speciﬁc re-
ceivers in the system beforehand, and thus suit the IoT sce-
nario to enforce ﬁne-grained access control on a large num-
ber of receivers. However, a major drawback of ABE is the
computational cost for decryption, which increases linearly
with the complexity of the access policy (i.e., the number
of attributes), due to the expensive paring operations when
the receiver matches her attributes to the access policy. As
tested in [13], it took about 30 seconds for a smart phone (in
particular an iPhone 3G in that experiment) to decrypt a ci-
phertext containing 100 attributes. For resource-constrained
recipients that are typical in an IoT application, the com-
putational cost is too expensive to aﬀord. With the emer-
gence of cloud computing infrastructures such as Amazon
EC2 and Microsoft Azure, outsourced-ABE schemes have
been proposed [13, 29, 15, 19] to leverage the computational
power of the clouds by outsourcing a part of the expensive
decryption operations to them.
However, privacy becomes a critical concern when out-
sourcing decryption operations to a cloud. Most of the ex-
isting outsourced-ABE approaches assume that the cloud is
fully trusted to host all attributes of a user. In the real world,
a cloud server is rarely fully trusted by both the sender and
the recipient, especially when user attributes involve multi-
ple sensitive categories. For example, a cloud that is trusted
to process attributes such as “age” and “location” may not be
able to access attributes related to users’ health status, such
as “having heart disease X” and “weight>Y ”. Therefore, it
is more reasonable to assume a cloud as honest-but-curious,
that is, it follows the protocol honestly but tries its best to
infer users’ private information. Speciﬁcally, there are three
major privacy concerns: (1) Data privacy. The sender, e.g.,
value-added service providers, requires its messages and ser-
vices to be only accessible to a group of qualiﬁed users. Nei-
ther the cloud nor other unauthorized users should be able
to access the published data. (2) Attribute privacy. As ex-
plained in the above example, attributes contain sensitive
information about the user and thus should be protected as
much as possible from being disclosed to the cloud. And
(3) Access policy privacy. Access policies containing infor-
mation about data to be published, data sender and data
recipient also need to be protected. A stronger privacy re-
quirement is to hide the access policy to avoid privacy infer-
ence attacks. We argue that the importance of three types of
privacy can be ranked as: data privacy > attribute privacy
> access policy privacy.
In general, outsourcing the decryption operations to the
cloud is a promising technique to publish information to a
group of resource-constrained devices in IoT applications.
However, protecting the three types of private information
in the targeted broadcasting is still challenging. To address
the privacy issues discussed above, we propose two novel CP-
ABE schemes that employ multiple clouds to collaboratively
complete the outsourced operations, namely parallel-cloud
CP-ABE and chain-cloud CP-ABE. Our schemes delegate
user attributes and the decryption operations to multiple
clouds, and coordinate them to translate an ABE cipher-
text into an ElGamal-type ciphertext, without revealing the
original message, the accurate set of user attributes, or the
complete access policy to the clouds.
Besides protecting the three types of privacy, our schemes
also provide two additional features that are desirable in
the IoT data publishing scenario: (i) Delegation veriﬁability.
When we outsource the operations for matching attributes
to the access policy to the cloud, it is important for the
receiver to be able to verify the correctness and complete-
ness of the messages processed by the cloud. For example, a
“cheating” cloud server may violate the honest-but-curious
assumption and discard messages without performing the
matching operation to save its own communication and com-
putation resources. Therefore, the delegation veriﬁability
can be considered as a security enhancement for IoT data
publishing applications. And (ii) Lightweight operations on
receivers. Since the receivers are resource-constrained de-
vices, the operations of decryption and veriﬁcation at the
receiver end are expected to be kept light-weight, which is
supported in our solution.
The main contributions of this work are as follows:
• To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the
ﬁrst to protect user attributes against cloud service
providers in an outsourced-ABE setting using multiple
clouds.
• We propose two multi-cloud-based, outsourced-ABE
schemes. The parallel-cloud scheme provides a bet-
ter performance with strong privacy protection but
less system ﬂexibility and less expressiveness for ac-
cess policies, while the chain-cloud scheme supports
ﬂexible customization and expressive access policies at
the cost of processing latency.
• We present a lightweight mechanism that allows users
31
to eﬃciently verify the correctness and completeness
of the partial decryption in clouds.
• Our schemes enable a new application for data publish-
ing in IoT, namely privacy-preserving targeted broad-
casting, which is not possible in the past. This new
type of data publishing application will beneﬁt not
only end users but also information senders such as
third-party value-added services providers.
• We thoroughly analyze the security of our proposed
schemes and evaluate the performance with experi-
ments using Amazon EC2 and Windows Azure.
2. PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Bilinear Maps
Let G0 and G1 be two multiplicative cyclic groups of prime
order p, and g be a generator of G0. e is a bilinear map
e : G0 × G0 → G1 with the following properties:
a, b ∈ Zp.
1. Bilinearity: e(ua, vb) = e(u, v)ab for all u, v ∈ G0 and
2. No-degeneracy: e(g, g) ̸= 1.
3. Computability: for all u, v ∈ G0, the bilinear map e is
eﬃciently computable.
2.2 Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS)
A (k,n)-LSSS shares a secret s over a set of n parties with
linear reconstruction property. The secret s is divided to n
parties in such a way that any k or more parties can recover
the secret and any k−1 or less leave the secret completely un-
dermined. Speciﬁcally, Shamir’s secret-sharing scheme [26]
is constructed as:
