The file format for input and output files is identical. Data is packed consecutively as words based on the

the total size of the resource being tested. The size of the output file is the same as the input file and,
provided there are no errors, has the same content.

Install Ethernet and PTP Scripts
You can use Ethernet and PTP scripts that are included in the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics
software to test Ethernet and PTP functionality. Before you can install the scripts, you need to perform
the following tasks:
• Make sure the QFX-PFA-4Q module is installed in the QFX5100 switch. See Installing an Expansion
Module in a QFX5100 Device .
• Install Junos OS Release 14.1X53-D27 software or later with enhanced automation for the QFX5100
switch. See Installing Software Packages on QFX Series Devices .
• Enable SSH and Telnet services on the switch. See Configuring SSH Service for Remote Access to the
Router or Switch and Configuring Telnet Service for Remote Access to a Switch .
• Install the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics Software. See No Link Title .
To install the scripts:
895
1. Log into the guest VM using the request app-engine virtual-machine-shell guest-VM-name. The maximum
length for the guest VM name is 255 characters. Make sure you are logged in as root when you enter
this command.
root> request app-engine virtual-machine-shell diagnostics
2. Enter a valid username and password combination for the guest VM.
3. Enter the guest-util diag-install guest VM IP address command at the shell prompt.
Use the same IP address you used for configuring the local management address for the guest VM.
[root@localhost ~] guest-util diag-install 192.168.1.10
4. Change directories to /var/tmp to edit the PFAD_params.cfg file.
[root@localhost ~] cd /var/tmp
5. Open the PFAD_params.cfg file using an editor of your choice.
Here is an example of what is contained in the file:
[params]
# log level
LOGLEVEL = 'TRACE'
# my variables
VLAN1_NAME = 'VLAN100'
VLAN1_ID = '100'
JUNOS_USERNAME = 'test'
ROOT_USERNAME = 'root'
JUNOS_PSWD = 'juniper123'
GUEST_PSWD = 'diag'
ROOT_PSWD = 'root123'
# my duts
DUTS = {
'R0': "10.204.43.170",
896
}
TOPOLOGY = 'IF1 = 'et-0/0/2’
IF2 = ‘et-0/0/3’
PFAD_params.cfg: unmodified: line 1
6. Configure the management IP address.
DUTS = {
‘R0':
"10.204.43.170”, }
7. Configure the PTP interfaces.
IF1 is the primary source, and IF2 is the secondary source.
Configure IF1 as et-0/0/2, and IF2 as et-0/0/3.
IF1 = '2’ <<<<< Change it
IF2 = ‘3’ <<<<< Change it
8. Save the changes you made to the PFAD_params.cfg file.
9. Run the scripts by issuing one of the following commands at the guest VM prompt.
• To test traffic orchestration:
python PFAD_exec.py -t 1
• To test PTP:
./run_ptp_test
• To test Broadsync:
