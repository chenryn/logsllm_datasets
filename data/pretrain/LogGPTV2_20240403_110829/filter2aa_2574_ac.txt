based, and others are private companies that offer their services to different parties 
such as government agencies and business corporations on a subscription basis. In this 
section, we will mention the main OSINT organizations worldwide.

 Government Organizations
Government organizations working in OSINT analysis are still considered the best 
because of the resources available from their governments to do their jobs. The two most 
famous government agencies that do OSINT globally are the Open Source Center in the 
United States and BBC Monitoring in Great Britain.
 Open Source Center
We already talked about the Open Source Center (OSC); it is the largest OSINT 
organization and has vast resources to do its job. OSC works closely with other local 
intelligence agencies in the United States and offers its services to U.S. government 
intelligence agencies.
 BBC Monitoring
BBC Monitoring (https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/login) is a department within the 
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) that monitors foreign media worldwide. It has 
a similar role as the Open Source Center in the United States, with the main difference 
being that it does not belong to British Intelligence. BBC Monitoring is funded from its 
stakeholders in addition to many commercial and governmental entities around the 
world. It was first established in 1939 and has offices in different countries around the 
globe. It actively monitors TV, radio broadcast, print media, Internet, and emerging 
trends from 150 countries in more than 70 languages. BBC Monitoring is directed by 
the BBC and offers its services on a subscription basis to interested parties such as 
commercial organizations and UK official bodies.
 Private Sector
You should not underestimate the private sector when looking at who supplies OSINT 
information; many private corporations have developed advanced programs and 
techniques to gathers data from public sources for commercial gain. Indeed, most 
private OSINT corporations partner with government agencies to supply them with such 
information. In this section, we will mention the main ones around the globe.

 Jane’s Information Group
Jane’s Information Group (http://www.janes.com) is a British company founded in 
1898. Jane’s is a leading provider that specializes in military, terrorism, state stability, 
serious and organized crime, proliferation and procurement intelligence, aerospace, and 
transportation subjects. It publishes many journals and books related to security matters 
in addition to its OSINT sources that track and predict security matters in 190 states and 
30 territories.
 Economist Intelligence Unit
The Economist Intelligence Unit (https://www.eiu.com/home.aspx) is the business 
intelligence, research, and analysis division of the British Economist Group. The main 
domain of the Economist Intelligence Unit is its business and financial forecasts; it offers 
a monthly report in addition to a country economic forecast for the coming five years 
with a comprehensive view about current trends on economic and political issues.
 Oxford Analytica
Oxford Analytica (http://www.oxan.com) is a relatively small OSINT firm compared 
with the previous two. Oxford Analytica specializes in geopolitics and macroeconomics 
subjects. It has a global macro expert network to advise its clients on the best practices of 
strategy and performance when accessing complex markets. Its expert networks contain 
more than 1400 experts. Most of them are scholars on their subject, senior faculty 
members in top universities, and high-profile specialists in their sector.
 Gray Literature Vendors
We already talked about gray literature as part of OSINF data. However, this type of data 
deserves to have its own reference when talking about the main sources of information 
used in OSINT gathering because of its great intelligence value.
Gray literature is mainly produced by the world’s publishing companies. It includes 
books, journals, newspapers, and anything published publicly. However, there is 
another type of gray literature called gray information that has different acquisition 
requirements.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe

Usually the terms gray literature and gray information are used interchangeably. 
However, in the intelligence arena, they are slightly different. Gray literature refers 
to all publications that can be obtained from traditional bookstore channels, while 
gray information refers to other publications that cannot be obtained from traditional 
routes. Hence, gray information has its own channels, and it may be difficult to identify 
and acquire it. Gray information includes the following and more: academic papers, 
preprints, proceedings, conference and discussion papers, research reports, marketing 
reports, technical specifications and standards, dissertations, theses, trade publications, 
memoranda, government reports and documents not published commercially, 
translations, newsletters, market surveys, trip reports, and festival agendas.
Gray literature can be divided into three main kinds.
• 
White: This includes anything published publicly for sale through 
traditional bookstore channels. The publication should have an ISBN 
or ISSN and can be obtained directly from its seller. Books, journals, 
and newspapers fall in this category.
• 
Ephemeral: This type is short-lived. Examples include flight 
schedules, draft versions, copies of invoices, advertisements, posters, 
tickets, business cards, and anything that is self-published.
• 
Gray: This contains a mix of the previously mentioned two types.
Generally, gray literature can be obtained by paying subscription fees for such 
content or through buying books, journals, magazines, and other publications directly 
from bookstores. To acquire more hidden gray information, you have to use other 
specialized services. The following are some of them.
 Factiva
Factiva (http://new.dowjones.com/products/factiva) is a global news database with 
licensed content. It harvests data from more than 33,000 premium sources, and many 
of these sources (74 percent) are licensed and cannot be found freely online. Factiva 
collects sources in 28 languages in addition to its unique service of being able to provide 
access to resources that have not been published yet by their creators.

 LexisNexis
LexisNexis (https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/gateway.page) is currently owned 
by RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier). It originally focused on providing high-quality 
legal and journalistic documents, but it has expanded its coverage to include more 
services such as media monitoring tools, supply management tools, sales intelligence 
solutions, market intelligence tools, and risk solutions that analyze public and industry-
specific content to predict risk and improve decision-making.
The following are other companies that specialize in gathering online intelligence 
from both public and private sources:
• 
InsideView (https://www.insideview.com)
• 
NewsEdge (www.newsedge.com)
• 
Semantic Visions (www.semantic-visions.com)

 Parties Interested in OSINT Information
OSINT can be beneficial for different actors. In this section, we will list them and explain 
what motivates each one to search for OSINT resources.
 Government
Government bodies, especially military departments, are considered the largest 
consumer of OSINT sources. The huge technological developments and widespread 
use of the Internet worldwide have made governments a huge consumer for OSINT 
intelligence. Governments need OSINT sources for different purposes such as national 
security, counterterrorism, cybertracking of terrorists, understanding domestic and 
foreign public views on different subjects, supplying policy makers with required 
information to influence their internal and external policy, and exploiting foreign media 
like TV to get instant translations of different events happening outside.
Intelligence agencies combine legally accessible information with their secretly 
acquired intelligence (for example, using spy satellite images, electronic listening 
stations, and spies) to answer a specific question or to predict the future. Those people 
have the required resources (money and equipment) to capture and analyze huge 
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe
11
quantities of data on the Internet. The act of mining OSINT data by governments is 
expected to intensify as we move steadily toward what is now a digital age.
 International Organizations
International organizations like the UN use OSINT sources to support peacekeeping 
operations around the globe. The UN balances superpowers’ and emerging nation- 
states’ concerns when creating its policy, which requires it to be as transparent as 
possible. To achieve this, the UN found that it is more convenient to exploit OSINT 
sources (including commercial satellite images) for intelligence needs instead of 
depending on reports from its member states, which may have conflicting policies.
Humanitarian organizations, like the International Red Cross, use OSINT sources to 
aid them in their relief efforts in a time of crisis or disaster. They use OSINT intelligence 
to protect their supply chain from terrorist groups by analyzing social media sites and 
Internet messaging applications to predict future terrorist actions.
NATO depends heavily on OSINT sources for intelligence purposes and for making 
plans for peacekeeping operations. It also benefits from commercial satellite imagery 
to plan operations because not all NATO member states have such facilities. NATO 
has published three standard references about how to exploit OSINT to the public. 
The first one is NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook (https://archive.org/
details/NATOOSINTHandbookV1.2). The second is NATO Open Source Intelligence Reader 
(http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nato/osint_reader.pdf). The third one is 
NATO Intelligence Exploitation of the Internet (http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/
NSAEBB436/docs/EBB-005.pdf).
 Law Enforcement Agencies
Police uses OSINT sources to protect citizens from abuse, sexual violence, identity theft, 
and other crimes. This can be done by monitoring social media channels for interesting 
keywords and pictures to help prevent crimes before they escalate.
Law enforcement uses OSINT to monitor and track a criminal’s networks across 
different countries. For example, they use OSINT tactics to compile information about 
people of interest to create a complete profile for each one. They also use OSINT sources 
for online counterfeiting and copyright violations.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe
12
 Business Corporations
Information is power, and corporations use OSINT sources to investigate new markets, 
monitor competitors’ activities, plan marketing activities, and predict anything that can 
affect their current operations and future growth. In the past, exploiting OSINT sources 
was limited to big businesses with good intelligence budgets. Nowadays, with the 
widespread use of the Internet, small companies with limited budgets can exploit OSINT 
sources effectively and merge acquired information into their business plans.
Businesses also use OSINT intelligence for other nonfinancial purposes such as the 
following:
• 
To fight against data leakage, knowing that the business exposure 
of confidential information and the security vulnerabilities of their 
networks is a cause of future cyberthreats
• 
To create their threat intelligence strategies through analyzing OSINT 
sources from both outside and inside the organization and then 
combining this information with other information to accomplish an 
effective cyber-risk management policy that helps them to protect 
their financial interests, reputation, and customer base
OSINT is specifically useful for companies working in the defense industry, as such 
companies need to be fully aware of the surrounding circumstances of their customers 
to develop and target them with the appropriate equipment.
 Penetration Testers and Black Hat Hackers/Criminal 
Organizations
OSINT is used extensively by hackers and penetration testers to gather intelligence about 
a specific target online. It is also considered a valuable tool to assist in conducting social 
engineering attacks. The first phase of any penetration testing methodology begins with 
reconnaissance (in other words, with OSINT). Figure 1-1 details the main phases of 
penetration testing.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe

Penetration testers are paid by companies to break into internal networks to show 
where weaknesses lie and how to keep outsiders out. This is different from black hat 
hackers who exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to confidential data; 
however, both use the same reconnaissance techniques and tools to achieve their work.
 Privacy-Conscious People
These are ordinary people who might want to check how outsiders can break into their 
computing devices and what their ISP knows about them. They also need to know their 
online exposure level to close any security gap and delete any private data that may 
have been published inadvertently. OSINT is a great tool to see how your digital identity 
appears to the outside world, allowing you to maintain your privacy.
Individuals can also use OSINT to fight against identity theft, for example, in case 
someone is impersonating you. During this book, we will teach you different techniques 
to search for text, images, and video, as well as digital file metadata.
Indeed, all Internet users are using OSINT techniques in one way or another, such 
as when searching for something online. Whether it is a company, school, university, or 
person you are looking for, you are collecting some form of OSINT intelligence.
 Terrorist Organizations
Terrorists use OSINT sources to plan attacks, collect information about targets before 
attacking them (like when using satellite images such as Google Maps to investigate the 
target location), procure more fighters by analyzing social media sites, acquire military 
information revealed accidentally by governments (like how to construct bombs), and 
spread their propaganda across the world using different media channels.

 Information Gathering Types
OSINT sources can be collected using three main methods: passive, semipassive, and 
active. The usage of one in favor of another is dependent on the scenario in which the 
gathering process operates in addition to the type of data that you are interested in. The 
three gathering techniques are generally used to describe the ways in which footprinting 
works, in other words, acquiring technical information about target IT infrastructure 
(types of OS, network topology, server names, and so on). However, bear in mind that 
this book will teach you different techniques to collect OSINT intelligence, and technical 
footprinting is considered a kind of information gathering.
 Passive Collection
This is the most used type when collecting OSINT intelligence. Indeed, all OSINT 
intelligence methods should use passive collection because the main aim of OSINT 
gathering is to collect information about the target via publicly available resources only. 
In this type, your target knows nothing about your intelligence-collecting activities. 
This kind of search is highly anonymous and should be done secretly. From a technical 
perspective, this type of gathering reveals limited information about the target because 
you do not send any traffic (packets) to the target server—either directly or indirectly—
and the main resources that you can gather are limited to archive information (mainly 
outdated information), unprotected files left on target servers, and content present on 
the target website.
 Semipassive
From a technical view, this type of gathering sends limited traffic to target servers to 
acquire general information about them. This traffic tries to resemble typical Internet 
traffic to avoid drawing any attention to your reconnaissance activities. In this way, you 
are not implementing in-depth investigation of the target’s online resources, but only 
investigating lightly without launching any alarm on the target’s side. Although this 
type of gathering is considered somehow anonymous, the target can know that there 
is reconnaissance happening if they investigate the issue (by checking the server or 
networking device logs). However, they should not be able to attribute it to the attacker’s 
machine.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe
15
 Active Collection
In this type, you interact directly with the system to gather intelligence about it. The target 
can become aware of the reconnaissance process since the person/entity collecting 
information will use advanced techniques to harvest technical data about the target IT 
infrastructure such as accessing open ports, scanning vulnerabilities (unpatched Windows 
systems), scanning web server applications, and more. This traffic will look like suspicious 
or malicious behavior and will leave traces on the target’s intrusion detection system (IDS) 
or intrusion prevention system (IPS). Conducting social engineering attacks on the target 
is also considered a type of active information gathering.
As we said earlier, active collection and semipassive collection are types of 
information gathering, but you usually do not use them in OSINT gathering. Passive 
collection is preferred because it can harvest information from public sources secretly, 
and this is the essence of OSINT.
 Benefits of OSINT
In today’s information age, no one can underestimate the vital role that OSINT plays 
in the different intelligence arenas. The benefits of OSINT span many areas in today’s 
world. The following are the main ones:
• 
Less risky: Using publicly available information to collect intelligence 
has no risk compared with other forms of intelligence such as using 
spying satellites or using human sources on the ground to collect 
information, especially in hostile countries.
• 
Cost effective: Collecting OSINT is generally less expensive compared 
with other intelligence sources. For instance, using human sources or 
spying satellite to collect data is costly. Small businesses with limited 
intelligence budgets can exploit OSINT sources with minimal costs.
• 
Ease of accessibility: OSINT sources are always available, no matter 
where you are, and are always up-to-date. OSINT sources can be 
used by different parties in any intelligence context; all you need 
are the required skills/tools to harvest and analyze OSINT properly. 
For example, military departments can predict future attacks by 
analyzing activities on social networking sites, while corporations can 
use it to build their new market expansion strategies.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe

• 
Legal issues: OSINT resources can be shared between different parties 
without worrying about breaching any copyright license as these 
resources are already published publicly. Of course, some limitations 
apply when sharing gray literature; we already covered this in a 
previous section.
• 
Aiding financial investigators: OSINT allows specialized government 
agencies to detect tax evaders, for instance. Many famous celebrities 
and some giant companies are involved in tax evasion, and 
monitoring their social media accounts, vacations, and lifestyles has 
a great value for a government inspector who may be chasing them 
for undeclared income.
• 
Fighting against online counterfeiting: OSINT techniques can be used 
to find false products/services and direct law enforcement to close 
such sites or to send warnings to users to stop dealing with them. 
This is a great advantage of OSINT, especially when fighting against 
counterfeit pharmaceutical and natural health products.
• 
Maintaining national security and political stability: This might be the 
most important role of OSINT; it helps governments to understand 
their people’s attitudes and act promptly to avoid any future clashes. 
Wise governments utilize OSINT in their future strategies, especially 
for their domestic policies.
 Challenges of Open Source Intelligence
All intelligence gathering methodologies have some limitations, and OSINT is not 
exempt from this rule. In this section, we will mention some of the challenges that face 
OSINT gathering.
• 
Sheer volume of data: Collecting OSINT will produce a huge amount 
of data that must be analyzed to be considered of value. Of course, 
many automated tools exist for this purpose, and many governments 
and giant companies have developed their own set of artificial 
intelligence tools and techniques to filter acquired data. However, the 
tremendous volume of data will remain a challenge for the OSINT 
gatherer.
Chapter 1  the evolution of open SourCe intelligenCe
17
• 
Reliability of sources: Bear in mind that OSINT sources, especially 
when used in the intelligence context, need to be verified thoroughly 
by classified sources before they can be trusted. Many governments 
broadcast inaccurate information to mislead the OSINT-gathering 
process.
• 
Human efforts: As we already mentioned, the sheer volume of data 
is considered the greatest challenge for OSINT collection. Humans 
need to view the output of automated tools to know whether the 
collected data is reliable and trustworthy; they also need to compare 
it with some classified data (this is applicable for some military and 
commercial information) to assure its reliability and relevance. This 
will effectively consume time and precious human resources.
 Legal and Ethical Constraints
Despite the great importance of OSINT, it has legal concerns when analyzed or captured 
in many cases. For example, if someone acquires OSINT sources by illegal means to 
justify an honest case, how should the legal system handle it? Another dilemma is when 
the OSINT sample is minimized or selected according to the collector’s need. They could 
effectively discard important sources purposely in favor of bringing about a specific
