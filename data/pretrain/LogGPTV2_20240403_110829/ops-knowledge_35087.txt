Assistant: This log chunk shows the QuorumCnxManager software component attempting to establish connections with other nodes. The SendWorker and RecvWorker threads are interrupted multiple times due to connection errors. Three connection requests are received from 10.10.34.11 and one from 10.10.34.12. In the end, the SendWorker thread is leaving the thread and the RecvWorker thread is interrupting the SendWorker.
