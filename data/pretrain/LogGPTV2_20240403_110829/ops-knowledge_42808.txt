User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is there a way to view the members of an Active Directory group if you aren't a domain admin and can't log into to a domain controller? Is there a way to view the members of an Active Directory group if you aren't a domain admin and can't log into to a domain controller?

Assistant: Absolutely. From a computer that's a member of the domain, open a command-prompt and run a:

NET GROUP "group name" /DOMAIN


Unless your administrators have changed the stock permissions on the group object you will be able to view the membership that way.

You can use AD Users and Computers even if you're not an administrator, but this, at least, can be done w/o installing anything.
