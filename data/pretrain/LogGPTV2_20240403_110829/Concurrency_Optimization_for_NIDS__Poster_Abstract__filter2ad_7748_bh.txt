The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated 34 million opioid users, and 19 million opiate users worldwide Opiates are associated 
with health outcomes such as cancers, infectious diseases and psychological disorders In the 1960s, research by Dole and Nyswander theorized 
that addiction is initiated through a metabolic disruption Opium and derivatives can modulate gene expression, and impact neural and hormonal 
mechanisms, which can be reflected by metabolites excreted in urine The Golestan Cohort Study, established in the northeast of Iran, includes 
more than 8,000 individuals who reported opium use with a mean duration of 127 years For our study, over 500 urine biospecimens were selected 
for individuals who either reported no opium use (control), or reported opium use (maximum amount of opium eaten or inhaled per week), with/
without tobacco Untargeted analysis of urine was conducted using a UPLC-Q-Exactive-HFx-Orbitrap-MS NMR data was acquired on a Bruker 
700 MHz NMR Data were modelled using logistic regression, multivariate analysis, and hypothesis testing with the phenotypes of non-user vs 
user, route and level of use, tobacco use, and opioid use disorder (OUD) Metabolite identifications and annotations were made using our RT, Mass, 
MS/MS in-house experimental physical standards library (Orbitrap data), Chenomx library (NMR), and Public Databases We found perturbations 
in endogenous metabolites involved in one carbon metabolism, Krebs cycle, tryptophan metabolism, mediation of cell signal transduction, and 
neuroexcitatory activity Metabolites of illicit drugs, tobacco products, carcinogens, phthalates, and plants also contributed to the phenotypes 
investigated [Funding: 1U24DK097193, Sumner; NIDA INVEST Fellow, Ghanbari]

Coupling DAD and MS data in untargeted metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ron Wehrens, Wageningen University & Research, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Ron Wehrens, Jasper Engel, Rob van Treuren, Ric de Vos, Kenneth Haug and Philippe Rocca-Serra
In untargeted metabolomics it is not uncommon to record UV/Vis absorbance data using a photodiode array detector (DAD) in addition to the mass 
spectrometry detector DAD data can contain key information on the biochemical class or even structural identity of compounds exhibiting specific 
UV/Vis absorbance characteristics, like benzenes, plant pigments and Maillard reaction products DAD data nowadays are typically used in a quality 
control context and are rarely seen as an autonomous source of information As a result, no accepted standards for storing and exchanging data 
exist yet Here we report on an open and general format for LC-DAD data based on the ISATAB standard, used in repositories like MetaboLights 
This format allows the DAD data to be uploaded as a separate experiment assay Motivating examples of multivariate DAD analyses and 
couplings with corresponding MS data are shown for a large LC-DAD-Orbitrap FTMS metabolomics data set on lettuce samples, available through 
MetaboLights There are many possibilities for exploiting synergy between the two data layers Since the chromatography of the two data layers 
is identical the DAD data can help in a better alignment of the more complex MS data, absorbance characteristics can be used to help annotating 
MS features, and in some cases quantitation of compounds may be easier in DAD data, too When more and more DAD data sets become available, 
including injections of pure standards, multivariate analyses will become easier and more reliable, further enhancing the value of data dissemination 
through open platforms like MetaboLights

A Room Temperature Metabolism Quenching Method for Automated Metabolomics Sample Preparation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Genevieve Van de Bittner, Agilent Technologies, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Alex Apffel, Kristin B. Bernick, Manuel Gomez, Brian P. Smart, Christine Miller, Steven Fischer, Laurakay Bruhn
Many existing methods for cell-based metabolomic sample preparation require low-temperature metabolism quenching procedures to prevent 
interconversion of metabolites in a rapid, controlled manner The low temperatures required to quench metabolism often utilize cold liquids, such 
as liquid nitrogen, which are difficult to handle and store Additionally, low temperatures complicate automation of metabolism quenching steps, 
since they promote collection of condensation on robotic components, which can hinder robotic movement and cause rusting We developed a 
mass-spectrometry-compatible method for room temperature metabolism quenching and simultaneous cell lysis to avoid the issues associated with 
low temperature quenching A metabolic flux analysis utilizing this room temperature quenching method confirmed rapid metabolism quenching 
with no detectable conversion of 13C-labeled glutamine, added in the quenching and lysis buffer, to glutamate or other TCA cycle intermediates 
Adenosine triphosphate stability testing indicated metabolite stability was maintained for at least a day at room temperature We have integrated 
the room temperature quenching method into a complete sample preparation workflow that includes protein and lipid removal steps, which have 
been optimized for metabolite recovery, to provide a clean metabolite sample for LC/MS analysis Targeted and untargeted LC/QTOF analyses 
of mammalian-cell-derived samples indicate our new sample preparation workflow extracts key central carbon metabolites and provides a wide 
coverage of the metabolome Our room temperature quenching method simplifies the time-critical portion of the metabolomics sample preparation 
process, enables robust automation, and fills an important need in the metabolomics community

Novel MALDI imaging solution empowered by a MALDI-Q-TOF and dedicated bioinformatics pipeline for identification  
of metabolites and lipids from tissue
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alice Ly, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Janina Oetjen, Michael Becker, Richard R. Drake, Anand Mehta, Lucy Woods, Shannon Cornett, Alice Ly
MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) has emerged as a technique to spatially resolve different metabolic processes in tissue sections 
We present a novel workflow solution consisting of a high spatial resolution MALDI source and stage mounted on a commercially available QTOF 
A range of metabolomics imaging applications will be highlighted This includes measurements of endogenous metabolites; typically these 
measurements were previously performed using extremely high mass resolving instruments Measurements of mouse intestine sections revealed 
differential abundance of multiple endogenous metabolites localized to different anatomical regions Kidneys from rats treated with substance 
Factor Xa antagonist and untreated rats were analyzed for the distribution of the compound, compound metabolites and lipid signals The 
compound (m/z 43215) and associated metabolites were detected in the renal medulla; neither were detected in the non-treated samples A number 
of lipid signals were increased or decreased in both the renal cortex and medulla of compound-treated animals when compared to those not 
receiving treatment When combined with a software processing pipeline for automatically annotating measured ions, this enabled generation of 
annotated images from MALDI-imaging data Glycoconjugates can be measured as metabolic endpoints of glucose metabolism N-glycan imaging 
was conducted on human liver carcinoma sections and results compared against a list of glycans generated using a high-mass-resolving MRMS 
system 61 out of 61 N-linked glycans signals were detected in the sample measured on the MALDI-QTOF, with clear differences in tumor versus non-
tumor regions These results demonstrate the capability of our MALDI-QTOF instrument for the MALDI-MSI of different metabolomics applications

New discovery from CE-FTMS based metabolome profiling applied into fasting rat
PRESENTING AUTHOR: MOON-IL KANG, Human Metabolome Technologies, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Kazunori Sasaki, Kaori Abe, Makoto Suzuki, Satoshi Ito, Tsutomu Negama, Kenjiro Kami
New unique platform, CE-FTMS, Capillary Electrophoresis coupled with a Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer, been established recently by our 
patent electrospray ionization (ESI) source adaptation In the application study with metabolomic profiling of multiple organ samples of fasted rats, 
we aimed to evaluate analytical performance whether CE-FTMS can be used as improved method compare to CE-MS for the purpose of analyzing 
charged metabolites comprehensively Here we report an overall appearance for plasma and soleus muscles in collected all 5 different organs with 
5 time-course points for 24 hours (n=5, each for 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24-hr) from fasted rats CE-FTMS platform resulted in successful detection of 323 and 
395 metabolites in plasma and soleus muscle separately, showed the increased detection number more than 17-fold or 18-fold compared to CE-MS 
Especially, 2-fold increase of detection number in anion mode of CE-FTMS at both plasma and soleus samples In spite of the significant difference in 
detection numbers between CE-FTMS and CE-MS, the movement of samples from starvation start (0 hr) to 24 hrs by CE-FTMS is pretty much the same 
as the CE-MS in PCA plot analysis, considering contribution of PC1 and PC2 Moreover, one third of metabolites within top or bottom 30 list of factor 
loading of PC1 and PC2 in CE-FTMS has not identified in CE-MS We also confirmed that several metabolites showing partly in CE-MS at the start or end 
of fasting time such as cytosine, S-methylmethionine, spermidine, and thymidine are identified every samples in CE-FTMS measurement

CO-AUTHORS: Padma Maruvada, Richard A. Yost
The NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Program has established a new consortium with the overall goal to realize the potential of metabolomics 
to inform basic, translational, and clinical research by (1) establishing an enduring national public repository for metabolomic data, (2) overcoming 
technical hurdles in analyzing and interpreting metabolomics data, including the ability to determine metabolite identities, and (3) developing 
consensus for, and promoting adoption of, best practices and guidelines to promote accuracy, reproducibility, and re-analysis of metabolomics data 
in collaboration with the national and international communities This presentation will provide a perspective on the consortium, and explore the 
opportunities to engage stakeholders and the international metabolomics community

In silico metabolite property libraries and quantitative chemical space analysis: a path toward novel molecule identification 
and false discovery assessment

Characterization of chemical “dark matter” is critical for human metabolome and exposure assessment, but the identity of many biologically-active 
compounds will remain unknown until analytical chemistry approaches are developed that (i) can identify compounds without reliance on data from 
analysis of authentic reference materials, (ii) have resolving power sufficient to resolve chemically similar compounds and (iii) have methods for 
comparing experimental data to reference libraries of chemical properties while accounting for the inherent accuracies in aspects of all associated 
analytical and computational pipelines To begin addressing this need, our team has developed a suite of tools that collectively assembles evidence 
for the presence of small molecules in complex samples through the use of libraries containing multiple measured and calculated chemical 
properties Here, we discuss the advancement of these tools and a current evaluation of this suite of standards-free identification methods on a 
set of natural products and microbial toxins Furthermore, we evaluated four existing and new methods for quantifying chemical space: (i) principal 
components calculated from over 50 chemical properties, (ii) K-means clustering on these properties, (iii) distribution of ClassyFire superclasses, 
and (iv) relative location in deep learning latent space The results show that compounds with similar behavior (eg detectable via MS) are best 
grouped using clustering, rather than by overall chemical class Finally, we discuss how these methods may enable determination of a conservative 
false discovery rate for molecular identification and lead to generation of novel candidate molecules that do not correspond to any currently known 
molecules

High speed untargeted 4D-lipidomics and -metabolomics LC-MS/MS workflows with Parallel Accumulation Serial 
Fragmentation (PASEF)
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sven Meyer, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Ulrike Schweiger-Hufnagel, Aiko Barsch
A crucial step in lipidomics and metabolomics studies is the acquisition of MS/MS data To reliably identify analytes, the MS/MS fragmentation has 
to be fast enough to generate a reasonable number of high quality spectra over a chromatographic peak This becomes even more complicated 
if the LC run times are very short While there is an in-depth oriented approach to ID as many lipids as possible, clinically-oriented projects often 
demand a high-throughput for large sample cohorts Therefore, a short cycle time per sample is needed to realize studies with hundreds or even 
more samples in a reasonable time frame In order to keep up with this, the analytical instrumentation needs to deliver a high data quality at high 
acquisition speeds This is realized by the PASEF (Parallel Accumulation Serial Fragmentation) acquisition mode For this presentation, extracts 
of the NIST reference standard SRM 1950 were investigated for the number of identified lipids using different LC run times The benefit of the 
additional ion mobility separation is to get clean MS/MS spectra of co-eluting compounds, eg isobaric lipids This is demonstrated on PC / PE lipids 
Furthermore, the ability to reliably identify differences between sample groups, even at short LC run times will be presented

Cytoprotective Effects of Wheat Sprout Extracts on tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide-Induced Oxidative Stress in HepG2 Cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hyeonmi Ham, National Institute of Crop Science, Rural Development Administration, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Hye-Young Seo, Hyun Young Kim, Woo Duck Seo, Mi Ja Lee, Ki-Chang Jang
Wheat sprout contains various ingredients that are beneficial to health It is reported that wheat sprout has antioxidant, hypoglycemic, 
anticarcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects Because of these health-promoting properties, wheat sprout is widely used in juice or tablet form 
However, the intracellular antioxidant mechanisms of wheat sprout are still poorly understood The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
protective effects of wheat sprout extracts against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells The levels of cellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated as biomarkers of 
cellular oxidative status HepG2 cells were treated with various concentrations of wheat sprout extracts (0~50 μg/ml) prior to treatment with TBHP 
for 4 h The incubation of HepG2 cells with TBHP led to decrease in cell viability However, pretreatment of the cells with the wheat sprout extracts 
rescued cell viability in a dose-dependent manner Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by TBHP treatment in HepG2 cells was 
markedly ameliorated after treatment with wheat sprout extracts Cellular depletion of GSH and formation of MDA were reduced by wheat sprout 
extracts Moreover, pretreatment of wheat sprout extracts prevented a significant increase in catalase and glutathione reductase induced by TBHP 
These results showed that treatments with wheat sprout extracts protect the cells against oxidative stress by modulating ROS production, GSH 
level, MDA generation, and antioxidant enzyme activities in HepG2 cells

NMR-based Metabolomics: A More Sensitive Bioindicator of Stream Ecosystem Health
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Robert Brua, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Adam G. Yates, Joseph M. Culp
Human modification of landscapes and subsequent degradation of aquatic ecosystems is a global threat to the ecological integrity of waterways 
This pervasive threat is evident in southern Manitoba, Canada where intensive agriculture has led to nutrient enrichment and habitat degradation 
of waterways In highly modified landscapes, there is great difficulty in assessing the ecological health of aquatic systems as few unimpaired sites 
exist and stream communities, such as benthic macorinvertebrates, traditionally used in biomonitoring have become more homogeneous Indeed, 
traditional bioassessment approaches have been unable to link human activities, such as the extent of agriculture in the watershed, and ecological 
condition of streams in southern Manitoba Therefore, a critical need exists to identify alternative techniques for assessing stream ecosystem 
health We used NMR-based metabolomics to evaluate the suitability of the metabolome of northern crayfish (Faxonius virilis) as a bioindicator 
of environmental exposure to stressors associated with agricultural and rural land use activities In contrast to past assessments using benthic 
macroinvertebrate composition, the metabolome of crayfish tail tissue was able to differentiate among streams with high, medium and low amounts 
of agriculture in the watershed Moreover, metabolite changes indicated stressor exposure altered energy metabolism pathways These results 
suggest the metabolome of crayfish tail tissue is a more sensitive indicator of human impacts on stream ecosystem condition in highly altered 
landscapes We conclude the use of NMR-based metabolomics to assess aquatic ecosystem condition should be encouraged We also recommend 
additional research to develop protocols and assessment models for aquatic biomonitoring using metabolomics

In the last decade, the increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) stabilized in Finland, coinciding with tighter regulation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS) In a mother-infant cohort study (n=264), we analyzed metabolite profiles of pregnant mothers and their offspring at birth with 
UHPLC-QTOFMS and GC-QTOFMS (260 identified lipids and metabolites) and quantified 22 PFAS in maternal samples during pregnancy (UHPLC-
QqQMS) We then further examined the impact of PFAS exposure on metabolome in non-obese diabetic mouse (NOD) model High PFAS exposure 
during pregnancy was associated with altered metabolic profiles, particularly with decreased phospholipids in the offspring This association was 
exacerbated with increased human leukocyte antigen-conferred risk of T1D in infants Importantly, we observed a remarkable similarity between 
the metabolic signature observed in the current study and the known signature associated with progression to T1D (Oresic et al, 2013) The NOD 
model verified our findings showing that prenatal exposure to PFAS resulted in a similar decrease in phospholipids also in the mice offsprings We 
conclude that high PFAS exposure may alter sphingolipid levels during fetal development which may then go on to play a pathogenic role in the 
development of T1D later in life Our data also highlight a potential role for a gene-environment interaction, which may lead to altered lipid profiles in 
newborn infants at-risk of developing T1D Taken together, our findings suggest that high PFAS exposure during pregnancy contributes to risk and 
pathogenesis of T1D in children

Xenometabolome of Mussel Exposed to Environmental Contaminants Mixtures in Field Conditions
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Diana Álvarez-Muñoz, Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research (IDAEA-CSIC), Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Álvarez-Muñoz Diana, Lidia Molina, Marinella Farré
In our daily life activities, thousands of chemicals compounds are released to aquatic the environment They can make their way first to river 
water and later on to sea water An interaction between the contaminants present in the aquatic media and the resident organisms may occur 
and some of them can be bioaccumulated Besides the importance of analyzing changes in the metabolome for understanding the effects of 
contaminants mixtures, it is also important to identify the xenobiotics accumulated that might be responsible of these alterations In order to study 
this a metabolomics approach was undertaken in mussels collected from Ebro Delta (Spain) The approach followed has allowed profiling the 
xenometabolome or exposome A field experiment was carried out and mussels from a shellfish farm allocated outside the Delta were transplanted 
into several sampling points for 1 month After this period, they were collected, haemolymph was extracted, centrifuged, snap frozen and kept at 
-80 °C until its analysis Prior injection in Orbitrap-Q-Exactive it was diluted 1:1 with methanol and filtered through a phospholipid removal plate A 
non-target approach was followed by using Compound Discoverer 21 The differential analysis was carried out by using the organisms from the 
“clean site” as a control group, and the organisms from the other sampling points as exposed groups Data sets were also exported to the statistical 
software “R” for multivariate analysis Preliminary results show bioaccumulation of pesticides such as bentazone, pharmaceutical compounds like 
venlafaxine, and other compounds with endocrine disrupting properties (ie triclosan and methylparaben)

Mosquitoes can carry infectious diseases from person to person and from place to place Presence and establishment of invasive mosquito 
species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus is rapidly increasing in the European environment The European Directive in 1998 led to the 
increasing use of biological insecticides such as cry proteins produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) that kill mosquito 
larvae after being ingested Considering the interest in Bti as more environmentally sustainable bioinsecticide, it is important to examine in detail 
environmental fate and impact of Bti The available tool such as half-life, t1/2, does not considers the biodegradation and biotransformation 
phenomenon of complex formulations To address this challenge, ‘Environmental Metabolic Footprinting’ (EMF), giving an idea of the resilience time 
was recently developed in the laboratory (Patil et al 2016; Salvia et al, 2017) to evaluate the impact of synthetic, botanical and microbial insecticides 
on soil and sediment matrix The project ‘EnvFate’ aims to employ an EMF approach, to dynamically characterize environmental markers of Bti 
pollution found among the sediment matrix meta-metabolome Metabolome characterization will require to develop and optimize extraction and 
detection protocols using LC-MS platform In addition, metabarcoding approach will allow to understand microbial community responses to the Bti 
pollution We performed a year long experiment to know the changes in the meta-metabolome after Bti and α-cypermethrin treatment in the three 
different sediment matrix These activities pave the way for the development and adaptation of new environmental monitoring tools

The ever increasing production and use of chemicals augment their occurrence in drinking water and its sources so that monitoring using targeted 
chemical analyses alone is no longer sufficient High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) based non-target screening (NTS) has therefore become 
a promising tool to assess chemical water quality as well as the changes thereof during water treatment However, to date the high number of 
features, ie unique combinations of accurate mass and retention time, resulting from NTS renders structural identification virtually impossible and 
prioritization is required Here, we developed an approach to interpret and prioritize features based on the integration of chemical and effect-
based data with data science methods, and applied it to the assessment of water quality changes in drinking water treatment trains at three pilot 
installations These installations included advanced oxidation processes, ultrafiltration with reverse osmosis, and granular active carbon filtration A 
selection of organic micro-pollutants relevant for the drinking water sector was spiked into the water treated in these installations LC-HRMS based
