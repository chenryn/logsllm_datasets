### Untargeted Metabolomics of Urine from Opium Users and Non-Users: A Golestan Cohort Study

**Presenting Author:**
Susan Sumner, UNC Chapel Hill, Nutrition Research Institute, United States

**Co-Authors:**
Reza Ghanbari, Wimal Pathmasiri, Susan McRitchie, Yuan Li, Arash Etemadi, Christian Abnet, Jonathan Pollock, Reza Malekzadeh

**Background:**
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates 34 million opioid users and 19 million opiate users worldwide. Opiates are associated with health outcomes such as cancers, infectious diseases, and psychological disorders. Research by Dole and Nyswander in the 1960s suggested that addiction is initiated through metabolic disruption. Opium and its derivatives can modulate gene expression and impact neural and hormonal mechanisms, which can be reflected in the metabolites excreted in urine.

**Study:**
The Golestan Cohort Study, established in northeastern Iran, includes over 8,000 individuals who reported opium use, with a mean duration of 12.7 years. For this study, over 500 urine biospecimens were selected from individuals who either reported no opium use (control) or reported opium use (maximum amount of opium eaten or inhaled per week), with or without tobacco.

**Methods:**
Untargeted analysis of urine was conducted using UPLC-Q-Exactive-HFx-Orbitrap-MS. NMR data were acquired on a Bruker 700 MHz NMR. Data were modeled using logistic regression, multivariate analysis, and hypothesis testing, considering phenotypes such as non-user vs. user, route and level of use, tobacco use, and opioid use disorder (OUD). Metabolite identifications and annotations were made using our RT, Mass, MS/MS in-house experimental physical standards library (Orbitrap data), Chenomx library (NMR), and public databases.

**Results:**
We found perturbations in endogenous metabolites involved in one-carbon metabolism, the Krebs cycle, tryptophan metabolism, cell signal transduction, and neuroexcitatory activity. Metabolites of illicit drugs, tobacco products, carcinogens, phthalates, and plants also contributed to the investigated phenotypes.

### Coupling DAD and MS Data in Untargeted Metabolomics

**Presenting Author:**
Ron Wehrens, Wageningen University & Research, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:**
Jasper Engel, Rob van Treuren, Ric de Vos, Kenneth Haug, Philippe Rocca-Serra

**Introduction:**
In untargeted metabolomics, it is common to record UV/Vis absorbance data using a photodiode array detector (DAD) in addition to mass spectrometry (MS). DAD data can provide key information on the biochemical class or even the structural identity of compounds with specific UV/Vis absorbance characteristics, such as benzenes, plant pigments, and Maillard reaction products. However, DAD data are typically used for quality control and are rarely seen as an independent source of information.

**Objective:**
To develop an open and general format for LC-DAD data based on the ISATAB standard, used in repositories like MetaboLights. This format allows DAD data to be uploaded as a separate experiment assay.

**Examples:**
Motivating examples of multivariate DAD analyses and couplings with corresponding MS data are shown for a large LC-DAD-Orbitrap FTMS metabolomics dataset on lettuce samples, available through MetaboLights. The chromatography of the two data layers is identical, allowing DAD data to help in better alignment of the more complex MS data. Absorbance characteristics can aid in annotating MS features, and in some cases, quantitation of compounds may be easier in DAD data.

**Future Directions:**
As more DAD datasets become available, including injections of pure standards, multivariate analyses will become easier and more reliable, further enhancing the value of data dissemination through open platforms like MetaboLights.

### A Room Temperature Metabolism Quenching Method for Automated Metabolomics Sample Preparation

**Presenting Author:**
Genevieve Van de Bittner, Agilent Technologies, United States

**Co-Authors:**
Alex Apffel, Kristin B. Bernick, Manuel Gomez, Brian P. Smart, Christine Miller, Steven Fischer, Laurakay Bruhn

**Background:**
Many existing methods for cell-based metabolomic sample preparation require low-temperature metabolism quenching procedures to prevent interconversion of metabolites. These low temperatures often involve cold liquids like liquid nitrogen, which are difficult to handle and store. Additionally, low temperatures complicate automation due to condensation and rusting of robotic components.

**Method:**
We developed a mass-spectrometry-compatible method for room temperature metabolism quenching and simultaneous cell lysis. A metabolic flux analysis confirmed rapid metabolism quenching with no detectable conversion of 13C-labeled glutamine to glutamate or other TCA cycle intermediates. Adenosine triphosphate stability testing indicated metabolite stability for at least a day at room temperature.

**Workflow:**
The room temperature quenching method has been integrated into a complete sample preparation workflow that includes protein and lipid removal steps, optimized for metabolite recovery. Targeted and untargeted LC/QTOF analyses of mammalian-cell-derived samples indicate that this new workflow extracts key central carbon metabolites and provides wide coverage of the metabolome.

**Conclusion:**
Our room temperature quenching method simplifies the time-critical portion of the metabolomics sample preparation process, enables robust automation, and meets an important need in the metabolomics community.

**Presenting Author:**
Alice Ly, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany

**Co-Authors:**
Janina Oetjen, Michael Becker, Richard R. Drake, Anand Mehta, Lucy Woods, Shannon Cornett, Alice Ly

**Introduction:**
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) has emerged as a technique to spatially resolve different metabolic processes in tissue sections. We present a novel workflow solution consisting of a high spatial resolution MALDI source and stage mounted on a commercially available QTOF.

**Applications:**
Measurements of endogenous metabolites in mouse intestine sections revealed differential abundance of multiple endogenous metabolites localized to different anatomical regions. Kidneys from rats treated with a Factor Xa antagonist and untreated rats were analyzed for the distribution of the compound, compound metabolites, and lipid signals. The compound (m/z 432.15) and associated metabolites were detected in the renal medulla, but not in non-treated samples. Several lipid signals were increased or decreased in both the renal cortex and medulla of compound-treated animals compared to those not receiving treatment.

**Software:**
When combined with a software processing pipeline for automatically annotating measured ions, this enabled the generation of annotated images from MALDI-imaging data. N-glycan imaging was conducted on human liver carcinoma sections, and results were compared against a list of glycans generated using a high-mass-resolving MRMS system. 61 out of 61 N-linked glycan signals were detected in the sample measured on the MALDI-QTOF, with clear differences in tumor versus non-tumor regions.

**Conclusion:**
These results demonstrate the capability of our MALDI-QTOF instrument for MALDI-MSI in various metabolomics applications.

### New Discovery from CE-FTMS Based Metabolome Profiling Applied to Fasting Rat

**Presenting Author:**
Moon-Il Kang, Human Metabolome Technologies, Japan

**Co-Authors:**
Kazunori Sasaki, Kaori Abe, Makoto Suzuki, Satoshi Ito, Tsutomu Negama, Kenjiro Kami

**Introduction:**
A new platform, Capillary Electrophoresis coupled with a Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer (CE-FTMS), has been established recently by adapting our patented electrospray ionization (ESI) source. In this application study, we aimed to evaluate the analytical performance of CE-FTMS in metabolomic profiling of multiple organ samples from fasted rats.

**Methods:**
We collected samples from five different organs (plasma and soleus muscle) at five time points (0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours) from fasted rats (n=5). CE-FTMS resulted in the detection of 323 and 395 metabolites in plasma and soleus muscle, respectively, showing a 1.7-fold and 1.8-fold increase in detection numbers compared to CE-MS. Particularly, there was a 2-fold increase in detection numbers in the anion mode of CE-FTMS for both plasma and soleus samples.

**Results:**
Despite the significant difference in detection numbers between CE-FTMS and CE-MS, the movement of samples from the start of starvation (0 hours) to 24 hours in PCA plot analysis was similar, considering the contribution of PC1 and PC2. One-third of the metabolites within the top or bottom 30 list of factor loading of PC1 and PC2 in CE-FTMS were not identified in CE-MS. Several metabolites, such as cytosine, S-methylmethionine, spermidine, and thymidine, which were only partially detected in CE-MS at the start or end of fasting, were identified in all samples in CE-FTMS measurements.

**Conclusion:**
CE-FTMS offers improved detection and comprehensive analysis of charged metabolites, making it a valuable tool for metabolomic studies.

### In Silico Metabolite Property Libraries and Quantitative Chemical Space Analysis: A Path Toward Novel Molecule Identification and False Discovery Assessment

**Presenting Author:**
Ryan Renslow, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, United States

**Co-Authors:**
Sean Colby, Jamie Nuñez, Yasemin Yesiltepe, Niranjan Govind, Dennis Thomas, John Cort, Justin Teeguarden, Karen Wahl, David Wunschel, Thomas O. Metz

**Background:**
Characterizing chemical "dark matter" is critical for human metabolome and exposure assessment. Many biologically active compounds remain unknown until analytical chemistry approaches are developed that can identify compounds without reliance on authentic reference materials, have sufficient resolving power to differentiate chemically similar compounds, and have methods for comparing experimental data to reference libraries of chemical properties.

**Methods:**
Our team has developed a suite of tools that collectively assemble evidence for the presence of small molecules in complex samples using libraries containing multiple measured and calculated chemical properties. We evaluated four existing and new methods for quantifying chemical space: (i) principal components calculated from over 50 chemical properties, (ii) K-means clustering on these properties, (iii) distribution of ClassyFire superclasses, and (iv) relative location in deep learning latent space.

**Results:**
Compounds with similar behavior (e.g., detectable via MS) are best grouped using clustering rather than by overall chemical class. These methods may enable the determination of a conservative false discovery rate for molecular identification and lead to the generation of novel candidate molecules that do not correspond to any currently known molecules.

**Conclusion:**
These methods provide a path toward the identification of novel molecules and the assessment of false discoveries in metabolomics studies.

### High-Speed Untargeted 4D-Lipidomics and -Metabolomics LC-MS/MS Workflows with Parallel Accumulation Serial Fragmentation (PASEF)

**Presenting Author:**
Sven Meyer, Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany

**Co-Authors:**
Ulrike Schweiger-Hufnagel, Aiko Barsch

**Introduction:**
A crucial step in lipidomics and metabolomics studies is the acquisition of MS/MS data. To reliably identify analytes, the MS/MS fragmentation must be fast enough to generate a reasonable number of high-quality spectra over a chromatographic peak. This becomes more challenging with short LC run times. Clinically-oriented projects often demand high throughput for large sample cohorts, necessitating a short cycle time per sample.

**Solution:**
The PASEF (Parallel Accumulation Serial Fragmentation) acquisition mode delivers high data quality at high acquisition speeds. Extracts of the NIST reference standard SRM 1950 were investigated for the number of identified lipids using different LC run times. The benefit of additional ion mobility separation is to obtain clean MS/MS spectra of co-eluting compounds, such as isobaric lipids (demonstrated on PC/PE lipids).

**Results:**
The ability to reliably identify differences between sample groups, even at short LC run times, will be presented. This approach enhances the efficiency and accuracy of lipidomics and metabolomics studies.

### Cytoprotective Effects of Wheat Sprout Extracts on tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide-Induced Oxidative Stress in HepG2 Cells

**Presenting Author:**
Hyeonmi Ham, National Institute of Crop Science, Rural Development Administration, South Korea

**Co-Authors:**
Hye-Young Seo, Hyun Young Kim, Woo Duck Seo, Mi Ja Lee, Ki-Chang Jang

**Background:**
Wheat sprout contains various ingredients beneficial to health, including antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anticarcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite these properties, the intracellular antioxidant mechanisms of wheat sprout are still poorly understood.

**Objective:**
To evaluate the protective effects of wheat sprout extracts against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells.

**Methods:**
HepG2 cells were treated with various concentrations of wheat sprout extracts (0-50 μg/ml) prior to treatment with TBHP for 4 hours. Biomarkers of cellular oxidative status, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and antioxidant enzyme activities, were investigated.

**Results:**
TBHP treatment led to a decrease in cell viability, but pretreatment with wheat sprout extracts rescued cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. ROS generation induced by TBHP was markedly ameliorated after treatment with wheat sprout extracts. Cellular depletion of GSH and formation of MDA were reduced, and pretreatment with wheat sprout extracts prevented a significant increase in catalase and glutathione reductase induced by TBHP.

**Conclusion:**
Wheat sprout extracts protect cells against oxidative stress by modulating ROS production, GSH levels, MDA generation, and antioxidant enzyme activities in HepG2 cells.

### NMR-Based Metabolomics: A More Sensitive Bioindicator of Stream Ecosystem Health

**Presenting Author:**
Robert Brua, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Canada

**Co-Authors:**
Adam G. Yates, Joseph M. Culp

**Background:**
Human modification of landscapes and subsequent degradation of aquatic ecosystems is a global threat to the ecological integrity of waterways. In southern Manitoba, Canada, intensive agriculture has led to nutrient enrichment and habitat degradation of waterways. Traditional bioassessment approaches, such as benthic macroinvertebrate composition, have been unable to link human activities and the ecological condition of streams.

**Objective:**
To evaluate the suitability of the metabolome of northern crayfish (Faxonius virilis) as a bioindicator of environmental exposure to stressors associated with agricultural and rural land use activities.

**Methods:**
NMR-based metabolomics was used to assess the metabolome of crayfish tail tissue. Crayfish were collected from streams with high, medium, and low amounts of agriculture in the watershed.

**Results:**
The metabolome of crayfish tail tissue was able to differentiate among streams with varying levels of agricultural activity. Metabolite changes indicated alterations in energy metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the metabolome of crayfish tail tissue is a more sensitive indicator of human impacts on stream ecosystem condition in highly altered landscapes.

**Conclusion:**
The use of NMR-based metabolomics to assess aquatic ecosystem condition should be encouraged. Additional research is recommended to develop protocols and assessment models for aquatic biomonitoring using metabolomics.

**Background:**
The increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) stabilized in Finland, coinciding with tighter regulation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In a mother-infant cohort study (n=264), we analyzed metabolite profiles of pregnant mothers and their offspring at birth using UHPLC-QTOFMS and GC-QTOFMS. We also quantified 22 PFAS in maternal samples during pregnancy using UHPLC-QqQMS.

**Methods:**
We examined the impact of PFAS exposure on the metabolome in a non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. High PFAS exposure during pregnancy was associated with altered metabolic profiles, particularly with decreased phospholipids in the offspring. This association was exacerbated in infants with increased human leukocyte antigen-conferred risk of T1D.

**Results:**
The metabolic signature observed in the current study was remarkably similar to the known signature associated with progression to T1D. The NOD model verified our findings, showing that prenatal exposure to PFAS resulted in a similar decrease in phospholipids in the mice offspring.

**Conclusion:**
High PFAS exposure may alter sphingolipid levels during fetal development, potentially playing a pathogenic role in the development of T1D later in life. Our data highlight a potential gene-environment interaction leading to altered lipid profiles in newborn infants at risk of developing T1D. High PFAS exposure during pregnancy contributes to the risk and pathogenesis of T1D in children.

### Xenometabolome of Mussel Exposed to Environmental Contaminants Mixtures in Field Conditions

**Presenting Author:**
Diana Álvarez-Muñoz, Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research (IDAEA-CSIC), Spain

**Co-Authors:**
Lidia Molina, Marinella Farré

**Background:**
Thousands of chemicals are released into aquatic environments through daily activities, potentially bioaccumulating in resident organisms. It is important to analyze changes in the metabolome to understand the effects of contaminant mixtures and to identify the xenobiotics responsible for these alterations.

**Methods:**
A metabolomics approach was undertaken in mussels collected from the Ebro Delta (Spain). A field experiment was conducted, transplanting mussels from a shellfish farm outside the Delta into several sampling points for one month. After collection, haemolymph was extracted, centrifuged, snap-frozen, and kept at -80°C until analysis. Prior to injection into an Orbitrap-Q-Exactive, the samples were diluted 1:1 with methanol and filtered through a phospholipid removal plate. A non-target approach was followed using Compound Discoverer 2.1, and differential analysis was carried out using the organisms from the "clean site" as a control group.

**Results:**
Preliminary results show bioaccumulation of pesticides such as bentazone, pharmaceutical compounds like venlafaxine, and other compounds with endocrine-disrupting properties (e.g., triclosan and methylparaben).

**Conclusion:**
This study highlights the importance of using a metabolomics approach to profile the xenometabolome and understand the effects of environmental contaminants on aquatic organisms.

### Metabolic Footprinting Approach to Study Long-Term Environmental Impacts of Biological and Synthetic Insecticides

**Presenting Author:**
Cédric Bertrand, AKINAO / CRIOBE / UPVD, France

**Co-Authors:**
Chandrashekhar Patil, Amani Ben Jrad, Hikmat Ghosson, Delphine Raviglione, Marie-Virginie

**Background:**
Mosquitoes can carry infectious diseases, and the presence and establishment of invasive mosquito species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are rapidly increasing in Europe. The European Directive in 1998 led to the increased use of biological insecticides such as cry proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), which kill mosquito larvae after ingestion. It is important to examine the environmental fate and impact of Bti.

**Objective:**
To address the challenge of evaluating the biodegradation and biotransformation of complex formulations, 'Environmental Metabolic Footprinting' (EMF) was developed to dynamically characterize environmental markers of Bti pollution in the sediment matrix meta-metabolome.

**Methods:**
A year-long experiment was performed to assess changes in the meta-metabolome after Bti and α-cypermethrin treatment in three different sediment matrices. Metabolome characterization required the development and optimization of extraction and detection protocols using LC-MS. Metabarcoding was used to understand microbial community responses to Bti pollution.

**Conclusion:**
These activities pave the way for the development and adaptation of new environmental monitoring tools to assess the long-term impacts of biological and synthetic insecticides.

**Presenting Author:**
Andrea Mizzi Brunner, KWR Watercycle Research Institute, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:**
Cheryl Bertelkamp, Milou Dingemans, Annemieke Kolkman, Bas Wols, Bram Martijn, Ton Knol, Thomas ter Laak

**Background:**
The increasing production and use of chemicals augment their occurrence in drinking water and its sources, making monitoring using targeted chemical analyses alone insufficient. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) based non-target screening (NTS) has become a promising tool to assess chemical water quality and the changes thereof during water treatment.

**Objective:**
To develop an approach to interpret and prioritize features based on the integration of chemical and effect-based data with data science methods, and apply it to the assessment of water quality changes in drinking water treatment trains at three pilot installations.

**Methods:**
Three pilot installations, including advanced oxidation processes, ultrafiltration with reverse osmosis, and granular active carbon filtration, were used. A selection of organic micro-pollutants relevant to the drinking water sector was spiked into the water treated in these installations. LC-HRMS based NTS was performed, and the resulting features were prioritized using integrated chemical and effect-based data.

**Results:**
This approach allowed for the prioritization of features and the interpretation of water quality changes during treatment. The integration of NTS and effect-based monitoring provides a comprehensive assessment of the impact of organic micro-pollutants on water quality.

**Conclusion:**
This approach paves the way for the development of new tools and methods to monitor and manage the quality of drinking water, ensuring the safety and sustainability of water resources.
