User:  How to build a highly available web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
Assistant: To build a highly available web application using AWS, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Use AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): ELB can distribute incoming network traffic to different Amazon EC2 instances to prevent single point of failure and improve usability. 2. Select multiple regions: In AWS, applications can be replicated to multiple Availability Zones (AZs) so that in the event of a regional failure, requests can be serviced in another AZ. 3. Utilize Amazon RDS: Utilize Amazon RDS to store all the data of the application and ensure that the data is backed up in multiple availability zones. 4. Use Amazon S3 to store media files: Store all media files in the application via AWS S3 to support individual media storage availability. 5. Using Auto Scaling: Using the automatic scaling service, EC2 instances can be dynamically expanded to cope with changing traffic demands when more computing resources are needed. In summary, using the power of AWS is key to building highly available web applications. Properly designed and applied these tools will ultimately enhance the reliability and availability of applications.
