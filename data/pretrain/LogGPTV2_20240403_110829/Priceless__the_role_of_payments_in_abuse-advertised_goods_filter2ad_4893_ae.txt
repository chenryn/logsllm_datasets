ple, in response to RxPayouts’ photo ID requirement for new cus-
tomers (started in late January of 2012), there was an uproar among
its afﬁliates. On one English-speaking forum catering to pharma-
ceutical afﬁliates, an RxPayouts afﬁliate wrote, “This new rule is
killing me, my conversion rate for new customers have dropped to
cero [sic]. As soon as my new customers ﬁnd out they have to fax
their customer service a Photo-ID, they cancel their order.” Another
commented “right now I am getting approx. only 10% of my orders
being completed.”
Blacklisting
Before processing a transaction, it is common to evaluate the fraud
risk of a customer. New customers, for example, have higher risk.
If the transaction is from an IP address used by a previous customer
who has had a chargeback or a decline in the past, then it has higher
risk. We are aware of shop runners manually ﬁltering out the orders
of particular individuals whom they believe to be under-cover op-
eratives [8]. We have encountered shops that ﬁlter out IP addresses
used on previously unsuccessful orders, and we have encountered
shops that refuse to process payments on credit cards with partic-
ular BINs (indeed, this approach forced our group to partner with
multiple issuers to obtain a diverse set of BINs for the payment
cards used in our study).16 Similarly, we have identiﬁed distressed
programs that use IP geo-location to specialize payment options
(i.e., to weed out US purchases). For example, after having a num-
ber of merchant accounts shut down the 4RX program stopped of-
fering Visa to US customers, but accessing one of the sites via a
European IP address would still provide a Visa payment option.
All of these techniques raise the stakes for undercover purchasing
since it again creates an increased “cover burden” for IP diversity,
geographic diversity, BIN diversity, name diversity, etc.
Finally, we are aware that there are some programs who have
chosen to “weather the storm” by only accepting orders from ex-
isting customers. This strategy again can have signiﬁcant revenue
drawbacks; even so, McCoy et al. have previously documented that
repeat orders can constitute 30% of overall sales [11].
5.2 Complaint bypass
The nature of the complaint process used for these targeted in-
terventions is that a brand holder makes a claim that a given site is
infringing on their intellectual property. Having identiﬁed the ac-
quiring bank, the “lever” for forcing action is embedded in the card
association’s contract rules that stipulate that the acquirer should
not support infringing merchants. However, it is only the brand
16We identiﬁed BIN ﬁltering by placing orders from programs using
two fresh cards with new IP addresses, addresses and names but
from different issuers (and hence completely different BINs).
854holder who has “standing” to issue such a complaint, since pre-
sumably only they are in a position to know that a site is not duly
authorized to sell these goods.
During the OEM software action, we identiﬁed two afﬁliate pro-
grams, that we call OmegabidSoft and CD OEM, who actively took
advantage of this structure to maintain their existing banking rela-
tionships. In particular both programs removed the software offered
by the brandholder making the complaint and thus, while they con-
tinued to sell counterfeit software by other brands, the complainant
no longer had standing to make a case. We believe that this is the
reason that the two associated banks, B+S Card Services and Wire-
card, continued to allow these merchant accounts to process orders
in spite of multiple such complaints. In principal, another affected
brandholder (i.e., whose software was still being sold) could have
complained as well, but this would require more organization than
existed in this initial effort.
For similar reasons, in the last two months a number of phar-
maceutical programs have started replacing brand name drugs with
their generic equivalents (e.g., Sildenaﬁl Citrate instead of Viagra,
Tadalaﬁl instead of Cialis, etc). The operators of these programs ar-
gue to their afﬁliates that such actions will eliminate the brand and
trademark issues and thus undermine the ability of brandholders to
shutdown both individual sites as well as the associated merchant
accounts. The tradeoff in brand avoidance is the impact on con-
sumer conversion (e.g., do US customers know what Sildenaﬁl Cit-
rate is?). It also remains unclear to what extent this ruse will work.
While trademark infringement indeed provides a clear “bright line”
standard to evaluate, card associations may still have sufﬁcient ﬂex-
ibility in their contracts to include patent violations as well.
5.3 Evasion
Independent of targeted complaints, afﬁliate programs must ﬁrst
deal with additional scrutiny from card associations and the com-
plexity of obtaining new merchant accounts when the old accounts
have been shut down. For example, from surveying forums catering
to merchant account brokers, it is clear that it has become extremely
difﬁcult to obtain new merchant accounts for online pharmacies.
Thus, many pharmaceutical programs have engaged in one or
more efforts to bypass these restrictions in practice. The most clear-
cut of these is miscoding. When this study was started in 2010,
close to 90% of pharmaceutical transactions were correctly coded
with either MCC 5192 or MCC 5122 (the appropriate codes for
pharma) and virtually all such transactions from “long-lived” banks.
The reason to code these transactions correctly is that miscoding is
a serious infraction, potentially carrying large penalties. However,
after these two codes were speciﬁcally called out in Visa’s GBPP
announcement (Section 2.3), correct coding swiftly diminished. In-
deed, almost 50% of pharmaceutical transactions over the past eight
months are miscoded (e.g, as Cosmetics, Grocery Stores, etc.), and
in the last two months this fraction is closer to 70%. Today, the only
bank that both correctly codes such transactions and supports large
numbers of afﬁliate programs is the State Bank of Mauritius.
Associated with this change, we observe compelling evidence
that some programs (or their PSPs) are driven to ever more risky
processing arrangements, including laundering the nature of their
business through an existing business of some other character. For
example, between August and October of 2011, both RXAfﬁli-
ateNetwork and ZedCash used processing laundered through the
merchant account of an online wallet provider (similar to PayPal)
using it as an aggregator. On another occasion we observed an
OEM software afﬁliate (that we call Eurosoft) processing through
the existing merchant account of a rental car agency in Spain. Fi-
nally, with increased pressure on OEM software afﬁliate programs,
we have recently found them attempting to execute payment through
banks located in the United States (which have not otherwise played
a role across our dataset). While we do not present the data here,
we have witnessed similar attempts with fake anti-virus afﬁliate
programs as well. All of these arrangements are considerably more
fragile than traditional merchant accounts because they are de facto
violations and are aggressively shut down by many banks as soon
as they are made aware (and for the same reason there is no require-
ment for a complainant to have standing).
5.4 Alternative payments
Finally, while payment card networks have, by far, the largest
footprint for Western consumers, they are not the only mechanism
for payment. Thus, we have seen a number of pharmaceutical pro-
grams with disabled processing (e.g., 4RX) attempt to continue
business after losing Visa and MasterCard processing fusing a com-
bination of Western Union and eCheck payments (eCheck is ba-
sically payment via ACH transfer from a checking account, the
mechanism used by online bill pay in the US). A few US-based
pharmaceutical programs, notably Health Solutions Network (which
we did not study in our analysis), enabled Cash-On-Delivery (COD)
payments for their customers when their Visa processing was dis-
abled. Ultimately, the effectiveness of such mechanisms depends
on their familiarity and overhead to consumers, the readiness of al-
ternative sites offering more traditional payments, and the extent to
which consumers are well motivated. Indeed, while we witnessed
some programs (notably in the OEM software space) attempt to
continue their businesses using alternative payment mechanisms
including PayPal and, most recently, Bitcoin, by all accounts this
has not been successful.
6. CONCLUSION
Security interventions should ultimately be evaluated on both
their impact in disrupting the adversary and their cost to the de-
fender. On both counts, the payment tier of abuse-advertising ap-
pears to be a ripe target. For the few tens of dollars for a modest on-
line purchase, our data shows that it is possible to identify a portion
of the underlying payment infrastructure and, within weeks, cause
it to be terminated. This termination cost is inevitably far higher—
in ﬁnes, in lost holdback, in time and in opportunity cost—than the
cost of the intervention itself. Moreover, as we have shown, there
are at any time only a modest set of banks providing high-risk ser-
vices and a smaller set still that cater signiﬁcantly to this clientele.
Thus, relatively concentrated actions with key ﬁnancial institutions
can have outsized impacts. Finally, based on our observations, this
approach is most successful when there is both comprehensive in-
telligence about the full set of programs involved and a willingness
to “follow up” on a per-program basis relentlessly. Taking down
accounts “here and there” does raise the cost structure for program
sponsors, but ultimately it takes focus to convince such operators
to close up shop.
Acknowledgments
This study involved support from a great number of individuals and
organizations who we would like to thank. On the purchasing side,
we are deeply indebted to our card issuers and people that helped
place trace purchases on our behalf, without whom this study would
have been impossible. As well, we have beneﬁted from strong re-
lationships with key brand holders and ﬁnancial service providers
whose insight and support has been equally critical. Throughout
our efforts we have beneﬁted from legal and ethical guidance from
Erin Kenneally, as well as oversight from Daniel Park, UCSD’s
855Chief Counsel, and Patrick Schlesinger from UC’s System-wide
Research Compliance ofﬁce. We would also like to thank Brian
Kantor and Cindy Moore for supporting our ongoing systems and
storage needs and, ﬁnally, we recognize the anonymous reviewers
for their helpful feedback and critiques.
