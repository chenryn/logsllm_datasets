### System info

  * Browser: Chromium
  * Other info: n/a
### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Link to the GitHub repository with the repro**
kumarchandresh/playwright-issues
**Steps**
  1. Run the test.
  2. See it fail.
  3. Replace `/ancestor::` with `xpath=/ancestor::` or `//ancestor::` in the source code.
  4. Run the test again.
  5. See it pass.
**Expected**
Test should NOT fail at step 2.
NOTE: If `xpath=/ancestor::` is a valid selector for Playwright, then
`/ancestor::` should be too since Playwright can auto detect the type of
selector being used.
**Actual**
Test fails at step 2.
