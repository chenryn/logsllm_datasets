committed, a small number of users pointed out how the in-
timate partner may be experiencing this level of privacy in-
trusion. We demonstrate this ‘pushback’ against IPS through
this responder on Forum B, after a thread starter admits to
monitoring his partner through a home security system:
“You sound crazy to watch her like that! The fact that
you’ve analyzed every little detail on the system tells ev-
eryone a lot about your own insecurities ... come on dude,
you’re trying to make something out of nothing here.”
Some de-escalating responders also reminded thread
starters of the potential legal consequences of engaging in
IPS. This included warnings that the use of some attacks
could result in a criminal record, failed divorce proceedings
due to misbehavior, or expulsion from social groups.
7 Taxonomy of IPS Attacks
We now describe the IPS tools and tactics discussed within
these forums. We present a taxonomy (Table 3) of four types
of attacks: (1) tool-based attacks requiring physical access,
including installing spyware on a partner’s phone and attach-
ing GPS trackers to their person; (2) tool-based attacks not
requiring physical access, including leveraging shared cloud
accounts; (3) strategies involving coercion and subterfuge, for
example convincing a partner to provide access, or tricking
them into connecting with falsiﬁed social media proﬁles; and
(4) outsourced attacks, namely hiring private investigators.
7.1 Tools that require physical access
Our analysis surfaced many attacks requiring access to a
target’s devices. These attacks are particularly possible in
IPS, due to the proximity between intimate partners [19].
Backup recovery tools. Recall that a common goal for at-
tackers was the discovery of what a partner said in their texts
or emails. To this end, responders promoting IPS often rec-
ommended the use of cellphone backup recovery tools: both
speciﬁc software dedicated to reading data from phones or
SIM cards, and creative workarounds leveraging built-in iOS
or Android features to access that same information. Some of
the spyware previously reported [6] works by accessing simi-
lar data stores; our data show for the ﬁrst time how attackers
share these products with each other, and how they homebrew
their own tools for accessing this information.
In particular, a substantial number of threads were dedi-
cated to tools that recovered deleted texts from iPhones. Sim-
ilar tools were available for Android phones, and in older
threads we even surfaced evidence of responders helping
attackers retrieve texts from Blackberries. While some re-
sponders in these threads advocated for the use of speciﬁc
products, others presented instructions for homebrewed tools
they had developed to read messages from a partner’s backup
ﬁles synced to shared iTunes or iCloud storage. Some respon-
ders posted code anyone could use to convert such backup
ﬁles into text ﬁles for easy reading, and many also offered
one-on-one technical support.
Keyloggers and screen recorders. Many attackers were in-
terested in continuous capture of their partners’ digital activ-
ities, such as websites they visited or passwords they used.
For these attackers, responders often recommended installing
keyloggers and screen recorders on a partner’s devices. These
tools had been surfaced as potential spyware in prior work [6],
but our data highlight they are actively shared as solutions
for attackers on these forums. One responder on Forum C
claimed he had installed keyloggers on all PCs and laptops in
his home, describing the beneﬁts of these tools:
“Great for capturing passwords & her true thoughts when
messaging (things she backspaced over and didn’t send).”
Many responders also recommended screen recorders, such as
those built for companies to install on workers’ devices—in
fact, this use case was often invoked to prove a product’s legit-
imacy. Responders also discussed the beneﬁts and drawbacks
of speciﬁc products, including whether the paid tiers of some
tools were worth purchasing.
Location tracking and audiovisual recording. We saw
many instances of responders recommending tools for en-
vironmental surveillance of a partner’s activities, conversa-
tions and whereabouts, e.g., voice-activated recorders and
GPS tracking devices placed in key locations like a partner’s
car. Responders were quick to make recommendations about
where to obtain these devices, how much one should expect to
pay for them, and best practices for hiding them from targets:
“A GPS tracker can ﬁt into a purse without them knowing.
I’m positive you can ﬁgure out a place to stash one in a
car. People track autistic kids and animals with them.”
1900    29th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
Surveillance of partners in cars was a recurring theme
throughout our data. In addition to providing recommenda-
tions on the best places in a car to place a GPS tracker, several
threads promoted the use of more sophisticated tools that plug
into a car’s on-board diagnostics (OBD) system and continu-
ously report the car’s location to a remote database, to which
an attacker can then subscribe. These tools would be useful,
one responder said, because “unless a person knows to check
the OBD they would never think to look for it.”
7.2 Tools that do not require physical access
For would-be attackers who were unable to access a partner’s
phone to install spyware or car to plant a GPS tracker, the
responders in our data readily provided tools that did not
require physical access to partner or device.
Leveraging shared phone plans. Many would-be attackers
sought ways to leverage the fact that they shared a phone
plan with their intended target. Most seemed to know that a
partner’s call and SMS histories were accessible on a phone
bill; in fact, viewing these was often the ﬁrst thing an attacker
tried, and the use of these records as vectors for abuse has
been documented [19]. But the contents of messages are often
left off of phone bills; in response, our data show these at-
tackers come to the forums to ﬁnd other ways to obtain more
information from their service providers.
Responders regularly provided tips on how to contact ser-
vice providers and obtain more detailed records: for example,
in one thread on Forum B, a responder described how to con-
tact Verizon and set up a monthly spreadsheet dump of all
call activity. Phone companies were required to provide these
records to account owners, the responder claimed, as a form
of consumer protection.
Attackers were also savvy to the many other ways a
provider’s plan management tools could be used to surveil
a partner. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile were purported to
have capabilities ranging from email monitoring to mobile
keylogging. Consider the following exchange on Forum A:
Attacker: “We are in the process of choosing new cell-
phones and a new company. Which is the best company
to keep tabs, records, etc? We currently have iPhones on
AT&T, and their Family Map did help me prove his affair.”
Responder: “If you’re getting everything you need with
AT&T, I would stay with them. They have immediate online
access [to phone records] and their GPS is good.”
In this example, we see responders outline the features of
shared plans that make them useful to an attacker: immediate
online access to call and text histories, quality GPS for loca-
tion tracking, and family sharing products that provide easy-
to-use interfaces for surveillant capabilities. This last type
of tool was especially common in our data, conﬁrming prior
work [6, 19]. This example also highlights the collaborative
nature of how attacks surface in these forums, with a respon-
der echoing and encouraging an attacker towards IPS. Of
note, the responder in this example is the third-most-proliﬁc
superuser of Forum A, and many of their posts are similarly
IPS-related.
Features of shared cloud services. Many tools that did not
require physical device access took advantage of the built-in
features of cloud-based sharing tools. The use of cloud tools
for abuse has been reported in prior work [19]; however, our
data show for the ﬁrst time how attackers share these tools
with each other as ways to overcome targets’ defenses.
In many threads, attackers seemed aware of the ways
iCloud tools in particular could be used to surveil partners
who had not provided device access. One thread began:
“What is the best spyware if I can’t get their phone, but
have their Apple ID and password?”
In this example and many others, our data show attackers
are encouraged by the forum to use their partner’s Apple ID to
view their personal messages and photos from a web browser—
no device access necessary. This was commonly invoked as a
solution for attackers who sought more detailed information
on their partner’s texts than records from a service provider
contained. Many of these attackers reported they arrived at
this method of attack because they had seen a drop-off in their
partner’s texting activity as reported by their phone bills, and
had inferred the partner had moved to iMessage or another
messaging service that used data rather than SMS. (Messaging
that uses data is not typically itemized on a phone bill.)
Some of these attacks, however, did not even require an
attacker to use a partner’s login, because their personal data
was already syncing to a shared Apple device. For example, an
attacker on Forum C described discovering she could view a
partner’s messages on a family iPad, which was synced to her
partner’s iCloud account. Our data show attacks of this nature
also levied against third-parties, namely the affair partners: in
one thread on Forum B, an attacker describes realizing her
partner’s affair partner was using an iPad synced to an iCloud
account shared by all three-parties, making her purchasing
and Internet history accessible for the attacker to browse.
Attackers were particularly eager to share how iCloud tools
could be used for location tracking. One attacker on Forum A
described how to use the Signiﬁcant Locations feature within
iOS to examine a partner’s recent location history. In an-
other thread on Forum A, a user shared an article on Find My
Friends and called out its abusive potential:
“Interesting article about an iPhone app called ‘Find My
Friends’, which you may be able to load on your spouse’s
phone to track their whereabouts.”
Cloud-based tools outside of the Apple ecosystem were
also called out for similar purposes. One responder on Fo-
rum C shared how Android users could view a “timeline” of
USENIX Association
29th USENIX Security Symposium    1901
a partner’s visited locations via their Google Maps account.
Another shared how WhatsApp’s phone-to-Web syncing fea-
tures could be used in concert with one-time physical access
to maintain continuous access to a partner’s messages. This
responder described the initial connection as a “one-minute
job” best done while a partner sleeps, and claimed they were
“actually shocked at what a privacy ﬂaw this seems to be.”
Lastly, our forums contained many suggestions for mobile
spyware products that leveraged cloud-based access to a tar-
get’s device, such as tools marketed for use in parental control
contexts. Much of the discussion of these products also of-
fered advice on free versus paid tiers, setup and conﬁguration,
and even best practices for contacting customer service teams.
Web trafﬁc trackers on shared networks. In several fo-
rums, we discovered threads in which responders offered ad-
vice on how to install web trafﬁc monitoring tools on a shared
WiFi network. The scope of this attack and the level of detail
in which it was described was noticeably more sophisticated
than others in our data, or what has to our knowledge been
previously reported.
In one thread on Forum C, a person who described them-
selves as a “heartbroken techie” with a background in soft-
ware development started a thread detailing how they used a
DNS resolution service to monitor the trafﬁc on their home
router. With their tool, the attacker said, they could record
every website their partner visited, regardless of whether they
deleted their Internet history, in the form of reports issued
within 24 hours. The attacker shared the command line scripts
and conﬁgurations they had used, and even offered to share
a GitHub repository where others could retrieve their code.
In addition to describing how they used the service to mon-
itor router trafﬁc, they went on to discuss how they used its
domain blocking alerts to manipulate their partner:
“You can set up a customized message (as I call it, the ‘oh
shit’ alert) that will pop up if they try accessing a site that
is blocked. It’s amazing how much someone will confess
if they know you’re tech-savvy and you tell them you have
a detailed history of their actions (even if you don’t.)”
In another case, a responder on Forum A who claimed to
be a computer security professional introduced the forum to
the concept of a man-in-the-middle attack and recommended
an entry-level tool for mounting one. As they described, the
tool was able to obtain not just a history of websites visited,
but also copies of data sent over the network, e.g. the contents
of emails and chats. Most notably, they described the tool as
a way to actively manipulate a partner’s activity:
“[You can also] modify the data trafﬁc in real time. This
can be used for tactics like replacing phone numbers,
names and addresses as they travel over the network.
Think about creative ways to change the contents of the
websites/emails/chats that they’re looking at.”
This last example was sourced from one of the ‘resource
threads’ in Forum A. The responder goes on to offer his
services to community members who want help mounting
such attacks. We discuss the implications of these types of
attacks and the role of technologists providing such support
in Section 8.
Reverse lookup directories. Lastly, our data show would-
be attackers seeking and receiving tips for investigating their
partners’ prior actions via reverse lookup tools, used most
commonly to identify people from their phone numbers. Most
cases presented as a thread starter ﬁnding an unknown number
in a partner’s texts or call records via other attacks, and then
asking the forum for advice on how to discover whether it
belonged to an affair partner or an escort service:
“If anyone knows a really good reverse cell lookup, please
let me know. Just found a few unknown numbers on my
husband’s phone.”
Many solutions offered were simple websites containing
databases of people’s personal information—one thread even
offered tips on how to search Facebook by phone number.
But responders in our data also recommended a wide array of
commercial products that market themselves as collators of
public information on individuals (e.g., WhitePages). Many
of these tools offer a free tier enabling lookup of names, ad-
dresses, and phone numbers in addition to a paid service for
more thorough background checks. Although these tools are
relatively unsophisticated from a technical perspective, they
featured in several stories that resulted in an attacker con-
fronting their partner or suspected affair partner at an address
or phone number located through these services.
7.3 Coercion and subterfuge
In addition to recommending speciﬁc tools, many responders
had advice for coercing or subverting a target into providing
access to their data and accounts, most often passwords.
Leveraging physical proximity to gain access. Attackers
frequently shared how they used their close physical proximity
to their targets to overcome common defenses without speciﬁc
tooling. While many of these tactics had been previously
reported from victims’ perspectives [19], we report for the
ﬁrst time attackers jointly developing such coercive strategies
in public forums.
In many cases, attackers advised each other to manipulate
a partner into ‘accidentally’ revealing a password, as seen in
the following example from Forum A:
“Get her to send texts . . . while you are sitting next to her.
Then try to make out the password as she types it in.”
These strategies often did not require active manipulation.
In some cases, gaining access was as simple as waiting for a
partner to fall asleep:

“My wife would get drunk and pass out. It was simple to
just hold the iPhone up to her thumb to unlock it. Took
pictures of a lot of conversations so I have a record.”
Some would-be attackers sought help creating opportuni-
ties like these. In one thread on Forum A, an attacker asks:
“I have wondered if there is a relaxing drug that will knock
