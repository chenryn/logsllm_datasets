User: How to optimize database performance? Please list common optimization measures and describe their rationale.
Assistant: Common measures for database performance optimization include the following aspects: 1. Establishing appropriate indexes Indexes are an important means to improve query efficiency. Building indexes for frequently used data columns can increase the query speed by several times or even dozens of times. The purpose of index creation is to quickly locate data, thereby avoiding scanning the entire table. However, it should be noted that the establishment of the index should be determined according to the specific query requirements. Too many or too few indexes will lead to performance degradation, and even problems such as deadlocks. 2. Optimize query statements For complex query statements, methods such as batch query and on-demand query can be used to reduce the pressure on the database. At the same time, you should try to avoid using subqueries, fuzzy queries, unnecessary joint queries and other statements that are likely to cause performance waste. 3. Properly adjust cache configuration Database cache is a common means to improve read and write efficiency. Properly adjusting the cache configuration can reduce the I/O pressure and speed up the query. The cache configuration can be optimized by optimizing the cache size, cache hit rate, and cache invalidation mechanism. 4. Database sharding/sharding For databases with a huge amount of data, sharding operations can be considered, and large tables are distributed to multiple tables or even multiple servers according to a certain rule, so as to improve the concurrent read and write capabilities of the database and the overall performance. 5. Rational use of storage engine The storage engine is the core module at the bottom of the database, and different storage engines have different advantages and disadvantages. For example, MyISAM is suitable for scenarios with more reads and fewer writes, while InnoDB is suitable for scenarios with high concurrent reads and writes. Correct choice of storage engine can greatly improve database performance. To sum up, the key to database performance optimization is to choose appropriate optimization measures according to the actual situation, avoid blind optimization, and improve database efficiency and stability.
