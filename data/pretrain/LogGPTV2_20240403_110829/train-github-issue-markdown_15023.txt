This issue makes TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks fails in some path
configuration from at least Go 1.4 up to Go 1.6. The problem exists only on
windows.
My current setup has go installed at the location G:.go. When running
all.bash, the test TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks will fail with this result:
> \--- FAIL: TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks (0.00s)  
>  path_test.go:1200: Results of EvalSymlinks do not match:
> "G:.go\src\path\filepath" and "G:.GO\src\path\filepath"
I tracked down the issue to the case-correcting procedure in
symlink_windows.go. It seems that Windows's GetLongPathName will not correct
the casing of a folder if it starts with a period.
The issue seem to be on Windows side and not on Go's. But it makes all.bat
fail when someone's GOROOT has a folder starting with a dot in it so I
prefered to make an issue for it.
