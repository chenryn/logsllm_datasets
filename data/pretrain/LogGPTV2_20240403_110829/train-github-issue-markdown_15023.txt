This issue causes `TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks` to fail in certain path configurations, specifically from Go 1.4 up to Go 1.6, and it only occurs on Windows.

In my current setup, Go is installed at the location `G:\.go`. When running `all.bash`, the test `TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks` fails with the following result:

```
--- FAIL: TestDriveLetterInEvalSymlinks (0.00s)
path_test.go:1200: Results of EvalSymlinks do not match:
"G:\.go\src\path\filepath" and "G:\.GO\src\path\filepath"
```

I traced the problem to the case-correcting procedure in `symlink_windows.go`. It appears that Windows' `GetLongPathName` function does not correct the casing of a folder if it starts with a period.

While the root cause seems to be on the Windows side rather than in Go, this issue causes `all.bat` to fail when the `GOROOT` contains a folder starting with a dot. Therefore, I have reported this as an issue.
