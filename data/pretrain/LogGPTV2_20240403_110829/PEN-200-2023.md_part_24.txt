### Listing 89 - Using `snmpwalk` to Enumerate Installed Software

When combined with the running process list obtained earlier, this information can be extremely valuable for cross-checking the exact software versions running on the target host.

#### Example Command:
```bash
kali@kali:~$ snmpwalk -c public -v1 192.168.50.151 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.13.1.3
```

#### Output:
```

### Listing 90 - Using `snmpwalk` to Enumerate Open TCP Ports

The integer values in the output represent the current listening TCP ports on the target. This information can be extremely useful as it can disclose ports that are listening only locally and thus reveal new services that were previously unknown.

### 6.4 Wrapping Up

In this module, we explored the foundational aspects of the iterative process of both passive and active information gathering. We covered a variety of techniques and tools to locate information about companies and their employees. This information can often prove invaluable in later stages of the engagement. We then focused on how to actively scan and enumerate services that are commonly exposed, using both Kali Linux and a Windows client.

There is no single "best" tool for any given situation, especially since many tools in Kali Linux overlap in function. It’s best to familiarize yourself with as many tools as possible, learn their nuances, and measure the results to understand what’s happening behind the scenes. In some cases, the "best" tool is the one the pentester is most familiar with.

### 7 Vulnerability Scanning

In this learning module, we will cover the following topics:

- **Vulnerability Scanning Theory**
- **Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus**
- **Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap**

#### 7.1 Vulnerability Scanning Theory

This learning unit covers the following objectives:

- Gain a basic understanding of the vulnerability scanning process.
- Learn about the different types of vulnerability scans.
- Understand the considerations of a vulnerability scan.

##### 7.1.1 How Vulnerability Scanners Work

Every vulnerability scanner has its own customized workflow, but the basic process is generally the same:

1. **Host Discovery**: The scanner determines if the target is up and responding.
2. **Port Scanning**: The scanner identifies all open ports on the system.
3. **Operating System, Service, and Version Detection**: The scanner detects remotely accessible services and their versions.
4. **Matching Results to a Vulnerability Database**: The scanner queries a vulnerability database to match the found data to known vulnerabilities.

Commercial vulnerability scanners often have the functionality to verify found vulnerabilities by attempting to exploit them, which can reduce false positives but may impact the stability of the service or system.

##### 7.1.2 Types of Vulnerability Scans

- **Internal vs. External Scans**: 
  - **External Scan**: Analyzes systems accessible from the internet.
  - **Internal Scan**: Analyzes systems within the internal network.
- **Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans**:
  - **Unauthenticated Scan**: Scans without providing credentials, focusing on externally accessible services.
  - **Authenticated Scan**: Logs in to the target with valid credentials to check for local security flaws.

##### 7.1.3 Considerations in a Vulnerability Scan

- **Scanning Duration**: Plan accordingly for large lists of IP addresses.
- **Target Visibility**: Ensure targets are accessible and consider firewalls and access restrictions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Adjust scan settings to avoid rate limiting issues.
- **Network and System Impact**: Be mindful of the potential impact on network and system stability.

### 7.2 Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus

This learning unit covers the following objectives:

- Install Nessus.
- Understand the different Nessus components.
- Configure and perform a vulnerability scan.
- Work with the results of a vulnerability scan.
- Provide credentials for authenticated scans.
- Gain a basic understanding of Nessus plugins.

Nessus is one of the most popular vulnerability scanners, containing over 67,000 CVEs and 168,000 plugins. It is available in two versions: Nessus Essentials (free) and Nessus Professional.

#### 7.2.1 Installing Nessus

For this learning unit, we’ll need to install Nessus on the Kali Linux VM. An internet connection and email address are required to download and activate Nessus. The minimum hardware requirements recommended by Tenable are 4 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM, but 2 CPU cores and 4GB of RAM are sufficient for our exercises.

Nessus is not available in the Kali repositories and needs to be installed manually. Download the current version of Nessus as a 64-bit `.deb` file from the Tenable website. Verify the SHA256 checksum to ensure the integrity of the installer.

#### Example Steps:
1. **Download the Installer**:
   - Go to the Tenable website and select the appropriate platform (Linux - Debian - amd64).
   - Download the installer and copy the SHA256 checksum.

2. **Verify the Installer**:
   - Use the `sha256sum` command to validate the downloaded file against the provided checksum.

```bash
sha256sum /path/to/nessus-installer.deb
```

3. **Install Nessus**:
   - Install the `.deb` file using `dpkg` and complete the installation process.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/nessus-installer.deb
```

By following these steps, you can successfully install and configure Nessus for your vulnerability scanning needs.
