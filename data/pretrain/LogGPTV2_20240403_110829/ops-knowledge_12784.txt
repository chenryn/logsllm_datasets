User: How to use Ansible automation tool to configure and manage Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL and other services on multiple servers, and maintain high availability and stability of the server?
Assistant: Here is an Ansible-based solution: 1. Install Ansible on all servers and make sure they can communicate with each other. 2. Create an Ansible Inventory file listing all servers that need to be configured and managed. 3. Create basic configuration files, such as nginx.conf, php.ini, MySQL configuration files, etc. 4. Define tasks in Ansible Playbook, such as installing Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL and other services and necessary dependencies. 5. Set roles (Role), including Nginx, PHP-FPM and MySQL, and define tasks for each role. 6. Use the template file in the role, upload the basic configuration file to the server and make necessary modifications. 7. Define firewall rules to ensure server security. 8. Set monitoring parameters to ensure server availability and stability. 9. Check and update the application version and configuration on all servers. 10. Execute Ansible Playbook to automatically configure and manage services such as Nginx, PHP-FPM, and MySQL on all servers, and ensure high availability and stability of the servers. By using Ansible to automate the configuration and management of Nginx, PHP-FPM, MySQL and other services, the workload of manual configuration and management can be greatly reduced, and efficiency and accuracy can be improved, thereby ensuring high availability and stability of the server.
