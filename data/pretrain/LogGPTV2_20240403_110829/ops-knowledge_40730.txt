It seems like you are experiencing an issue with PyDev not appearing in the New Project options or the Windows perspective in Eclipse, despite having installed it from the Eclipse Marketplace. I had a similar problem recently, and it was due to downloading an incompatible version of PyDev for my Python version.

To resolve this, please follow these steps:

1. **Uninstall the Current Version of PyDev:**
   - Go to `Help` > `Eclipse Marketplace`.
   - Search for "PyDev" and click on the `Uninstall` button next to the installed version.
   - Follow the prompts to complete the uninstallation process.

2. **Install the Correct Version of PyDev:**
   - Go to `Help` > `Install New Software...`.
   - In the `Work with` field, enter the following URL: `http://www.pydev.org/updates`.
   - Uncheck the box that says "Show only the latest versions of available software."
   - Select the version of PyDev that matches your Python version (e.g., if you are using Python 2.7.5, choose a compatible PyDev version).
   - Click `Next` and follow the installation wizard to complete the installation.

After completing these steps, PyDev should be available in the New Project options and the Windows perspective in Eclipse. If you still encounter issues, make sure that your Eclipse and Java environments are properly configured and compatible with the version of PyDev you are installing.
