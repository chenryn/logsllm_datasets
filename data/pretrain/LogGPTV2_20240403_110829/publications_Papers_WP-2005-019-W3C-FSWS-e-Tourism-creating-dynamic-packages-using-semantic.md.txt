**Abstract:**
Dynamic packaging systems have emerged as a critical component in the modern travel industry, enabling airlines, hotels, tour operators, and travel agencies to offer customized packages to consumers. This paper outlines the development of a platform that leverages the latest Internet technologies, including the semantic Web, ontologies, Web services, and Web processes, to facilitate dynamic packaging. The objective is to create a robust and flexible system that can integrate and process diverse tourism-related information sources to generate personalized travel packages.

### 1. Introduction

Tourism has become the world's largest industry, with consistent year-on-year growth. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) predicts a 200% increase in tourist arrivals by 2020. In this highly competitive landscape, gaining a competitive advantage increasingly depends on the effective use of science, information technology, and innovation.

The Internet is now the primary source of information for travelers, with approximately 95% of Web users relying on it for travel-related information. The number of people using the Internet for vacation and travel planning has increased by over 300% in the past five years.

Tourism Information Systems (TIS) serve and support e-tourism and e-travel organizations by integrating travel-related information from various sources to create tourism products and services. A key application within TIS is dynamic packaging, which involves combining different travel components in real-time based on consumer or booking agent requests.

Our focus is on developing a dynamic packaging platform that utilizes the latest information technologies, such as the semantic Web, Web services, and Web processes. These technologies are particularly well-suited for e-tourism, where information dissemination and exchange are crucial.

### 2. Dynamic Packaging Applications

Currently, travelers must manually visit multiple independent websites to plan their trips, repeatedly enter personal information, wait for responses, and make multiple payments. This process is time-consuming and often discouraging for consumers. Dynamic packaging technology aims to address these issues by allowing travelers to build customized trips that combine flights, car rentals, hotel stays, and leisure activities into a single package with a single price.

A dynamic packaging application enables consumers or travel agents to bundle trip components based on specified preferences. For example, a user might request a five-day stay on Madeira Island, and the system would dynamically access and query various information sources to find and combine relevant components in real-time.

### 3. Dynamic Packaging System Architecture

Our architecture for developing a dynamic packaging infrastructure consists of four main phases: integration of e-Tourism information sources, semantic mediator generation, dynamic packaging process generation, and final product delivery. Each phase is briefly described below.

#### 3.1 Integration of e-Tourism Information Sources

One of the major challenges in developing dynamic packaging applications is the lack of standardization in defining e-tourism products and services. Different websites may express prices in various currencies, use inconsistent time units, and vary in how they represent dates and temperatures. To address this, we use ontologies and semantic annotation to enable data integration.

##### 3.1.1 Lack of Standards

Our analysis of various travel, leisure, and transportation websites revealed significant inconsistencies, such as:
- Prices expressed in different currencies (euros, dollars, British pounds, etc.).
- Time units represented in various formats (hours, minutes, hours and minutes, etc.).
- Dates and days of the week expressed inconsistently (e.g., Monday vs. M, Tuesday vs. T, etc.).
- Temperature units varying (degrees centigrade vs. degrees Celsius).

To overcome these inconsistencies, we propose using sophisticated technologies like semantics and ontologies to automatically understand and structure the diverse ways of expressing tourism products and services.

##### 3.1.2 E-Tourism Ontology

The e-Tourism ontology provides a structured view of the tourism domain, organizing related information and concepts. It enables interoperability by establishing a shared vocabulary and meanings. We developed a partial e-Tourism ontology using Protégé and the OWL language, focusing on real-world tourism activities and infrastructures. This ontology is still a work in progress, with ongoing efforts to expand its taxonomy and axioms.

##### 3.1.3 Semantic Annotation

Semantic annotation is used to resolve differences among data from various e-Tourism websites. By annotating unstructured web pages with the e-Tourism ontology, we can store and query the semantically annotated data in a uniform manner across multiple heterogeneous sources.

#### 3.2 Semantic Mediators Generation

Semantic mediators support a virtual view that integrates semantically annotated e-Tourism information sources. These mediators do not store data but provide uniform access to various sources. They are automatically generated based on the e-Tourism ontology, forming a hierarchical structure derived from the ontology's taxonomy.

#### 3.3 Generate Dynamic Package Processes

This phase involves constructing processes that can compose valid dynamic packaging solutions. It includes:
1. **Abstract Semantic Web Process:** Specifies the control-flow and data-flow without defining specific Web services.
2. **Dynamic Packaging Web Process Generator:** Automatically creates concrete processes, optimizing them based on available Web services.
3. **Concrete Dynamic Packaging Web Process:** Executes the abstract process with specific Web services, ensuring functional validity.

#### 3.4 Dynamic Packaging Products

Final dynamic package processes are created using conditional planning, ranking, and selection. Conditional planning ensures that the packages are valid, while ranking and selection help identify the most suitable options based on the traveler's preferences. The Quality of Service (QoS) of each package is evaluated using the SWR algorithm, and the best options are presented to the traveler for selection.

### 4. Conclusions

Dynamic packaging is essential for the future of the tourism industry, allowing for the real-time combination of different travel components based on consumer requests. Our proposed architecture, which will be developed over the next two years as part of a funded project, leverages the latest information technologies to create a generic and reusable platform for dynamic packaging. This system represents a significant step towards the adoption of the semantic Web and modern information systems in the tourism industry.
