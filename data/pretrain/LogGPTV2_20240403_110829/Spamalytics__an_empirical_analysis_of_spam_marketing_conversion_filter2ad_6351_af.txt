8. CONCLUSIONS
This paper describes what we believe is the ﬁrst large-scale quan-
titative study of spam conversion. We developed a methodology
that uses botnet inﬁltration to indirectly instrument spam e-mails
such that user clicks on these messages are taken to replica Web
sites under our control. Using this methodology we instrumented
almost 500 million spam messages, comprising three major cam-
paigns, and quantitatively characterized both the delivery process
and the conversion rate.
We would be the ﬁrst to admit that these results represent a sin-
gle data point and are not necessarily representative of spam as a

Different campaigns, using different tactics and marketing
different products will undoubtedly produce different outcomes.
Indeed, we caution strongly against researchers using the conver-
sion rates we have measured for these Storm-based campaigns to
justify assumptions in any other context. At the same time, it
is tempting to speculate on what the numbers we have measured
might mean. We succumb to this temptation below, with the under-
standing that few of our speculations can be empirically validated
at this time.
After 26 days, and almost 350 million e-mail messages, only 28
sales resulted — a conversion rate of well under 0.00001%. Of
these, all but one were for male-enhancement products and the av-
erage purchase price was close to $100. Taken together, these con-
versions would have resulted in revenues of $2,731.88 — a bit over
$100 a day for the measurement period or $140 per day for peri-
ods when the campaign was active. However, our study interposed
on only a small fraction of the overall Storm network — we esti-
mate roughly 1.5 percent based on the fraction of worker bots we
proxy. Thus, the total daily revenue attributable to Storm’s phar-
macy campaign is likely closer to $7000 (or $9500 during periods
of campaign activity). By the same logic, we estimate that Storm
self-propagation campaigns can produce between 3500 and 8500
new bots per day.
Under the assumption that our measurements are representative
over time (an admittedly dangerous assumption when dealing with
such small samples), we can extrapolate that, were it sent con-
tinuously at the same rate, Storm-generated pharmaceutical spam
would produce roughly 3.5 million dollars of revenue in a year.
This number could be even higher if spam-advertised pharmacies
experience repeat business. A bit less than “millions of dollars ev-
ery day”, but certainly a healthy enterprise.
The next obvious question is, “How much of this revenue is
proﬁt”? Here things are even murkier. First, we must consider how
much of the gross revenue is actually recovered on a sale. Assum-
ing the pharmacy campaign drives trafﬁc to an afﬁliate program
(and there are very strong anecdotal reasons to believe this is so)
then the gross revenue is likely split between the afﬁliate and the
program (a annual net revenue of $1.75M using our previous es-
timate). Next, we must subtract business costs. These include a
number of incidental expenses (domain registration, bullet-proof
hosting fees, etc) that are basically ﬁxed sunk costs, and the cost to
distribute the spam itself.
Anecdotal reports place the retail price of spam delivery at a bit
under $80 per million [22]. This cost is an order of magnitude
less than what legitimate commercial mailers charge, but is still a
signiﬁcant overhead; sending 350M e-mails would cost more than
$25,000. Indeed, given the net revenues we estimate, retail spam
delivery would only make sense if it were 20 times cheaper still.
And yet, Storm continues to distribute pharmacy spam — sug-
gesting that it is in fact proﬁtable. One explanation is that Storm’s
masters are vertically integrated and the purveyors of Storm’s phar-
macy spam are none other than the operators of Storm itself (i.e.,
that Storm does not deliver these spams for a third-part in exchange
for a fee). There is some evidence for this, since the distribution of
target e-mail domain names between the self-propagation and phar-
macy campaigns is virtually identical. Since the self-propagation
campaigns fundamentally must be run by the botnet’s owners, this
suggests the purveyor of the pharmacy spam is one and the same.
A similar observation can be made in the harvesting of e-mail ad-
dresses from the local hard drives of Storm hosts. These e-mail
addresses subsequently appear in the target address lists of the phar-
macy campaign and self-propagation campaigns alike. Moreover,
neither of these behaviors is found in any of the other (smaller)
campaigns distributed by Storm (suggesting that these may in fact
be fee-for-service distribution arrangements). If true, then the cost
of distribution is largely that of the labor used in the development
and maintenance of the botnet software itself. While we are unable
to provide any meaningful estimates of this cost (since we do not
know which labor market Storm is developed in), we surmise that
it is roughly the cost of two or three good programmers.
If true, this hypothesis is heartening since it suggests that the
third-party retail market for spam distribution has not grown large
or efﬁcient enough to produce competitive pricing and thus, that
proﬁtable spam campaigns require organizations that can assemble
complete “soup-to-nuts” teams. Put another way, the proﬁt margin
for spam (at least for this one pharmacy campaign) may be mea-
ger enough that spammers must be sensitive to the details of how
their campaigns are run and are economically susceptible to new
defenses.
9. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This was one of the most complex measurement studies our
group has ever conducted and would have been impossible without
the contributions of a large and supportive cast. Here we offer our
thanks for their insightful feedback and individual contributions to
our effort.
Jordan Hayes provided decidedly non-trivial help with site do-
main registration. Peter Blair, Paul Karkas, Jamie Knight and Gar-
rick Lau at Tucows supported this activity (once we convinced them
we weren’t spammers) and allowed us to use reputable registrars.
Randy Bush provided overall guidance and help concerning Inter-
net operations and policy issues while Erin Kenneally advised us on
legal issues. Brian Kantor set up and managed our DNS, Web and
SMTP servers, while Scott Campbell and Stephen Chan performed
massive DNS lookups for us. Jef Poskanzer provided data access
for debugging our experiment, Stephen Chenette provided techni-
cal assistance and Fallon Chen was our in-house graphic designer.
Bill Young and Gregory Ruiz-Ade set up target e-mail accounts
in UCSD’s CSE department. Special thanks to Gabriel Lawrence
and Jim Madden of UCSD’s ACT for supporting this activity on

mous reviewers for their time and commentary.
