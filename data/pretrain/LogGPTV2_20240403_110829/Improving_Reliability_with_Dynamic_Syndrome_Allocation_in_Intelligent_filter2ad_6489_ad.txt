### Figure 9: Reliability Changes with Additional Syndrome Coverage

**Figure 9** illustrates the changes in reliability, measured as the expected annual block loss, for systems with initial RAID5 configurations of 5+1, 8+1, and 10+1. The additional syndrome coverage indicates the percentage of blocks covered by additional reliability syndromes (e.g., 0.25 indicates 25% coverage of one additional syndrome, while 2.25 indicates 100% coverage of two additional syndromes and 25% coverage of a third).

#### Observations and Analysis

**Observation 7: Non-linear Behavior with Few Clusters**

We observe that non-linear behavior can occur when too few clusters are used. This is due to the formation of larger, more inclusive clusters, which become more risk-averse for our quartile-based estimators as they include more large-scale write operations within a given class of I/O transactions. Additionally, the ability to allocate additional syndromes to the dataset is inversely proportional to the number of clusters used. As the system becomes more risk-averse and uses fewer clusters, the estimated space for additional syndromes shrinks, reducing the available space for additional reliability.

**Observation 8: Optimal Number of Clusters**

Based on observations 5, 6, and 7, we find that the optimal number of clusters for the data collected from the Illinois Natural History Survey is either seven or eight. A classification using seven clusters provides slightly higher reliability with a slightly lower under-prediction rate, while the opposite is true for eight clusters. Decisions involving parameterization are system-dependent, and data from System-S proved to be a poor predictor of behaviors seen in System-R. We have yet to derive any universal dynamics or models of user behavior, suggesting that it is domain-specific. Therefore, individual systems will need to train the S2DDC algorithm through an initial period of user observation.

**Observation 9: Diminishing Returns with Additional Syndromes**

Using S2DDC methods can improve system reliability, but beyond a certain point, we face diminishing returns. An unexpected result was the level of overprovisioning typically seen in a system, with three to seven additional syndromes available 50% of the time. As shown in Figure 9, beyond a certain point (two additional syndromes in our case), the additional reliability is of limited value, having already achieved less than one expected block loss per year. This observation leads us to conclude that additional uses of additional syndromes, such as improving availability or performance, should be devised.

### Cumulative Density Function of Syndrome Counts

The following figures show the cumulative density function (CDF) of syndrome counts for different scenarios:

- **Figure (a)**: Additional syndromes allocated by our algorithm using the statistical model and a 0.95 worst-case quartile prediction.
- **Figure (b)**: Additional syndromes allocated by our algorithm using the statistical model and a 0.999 worst-case quartile prediction.
- **Figure (c)**: Additional syndromes allocated by our algorithm using a k-means clustered Markov model with 9 clusters and a 0.95 worst-case quartile prediction.
- **Figure (d)**: Additional syndromes allocated by our algorithm using a k-means clustered Markov model with 9 clusters and a 0.999 worst-case quartile prediction.

These figures provide a visual representation of the proportion of blocks covered by additional syndromes and the corresponding cumulative probability.
