Let's say I have andpoint GET https://example.com/foo
When I use:  
$app->match('/foo', function...)  
-> OK, it doesn't redirect to https://example.com/foo/
BUT when I use:  
$app->mount('/foo', new SomeRouteController());  
and then in route controller:  
$controllers->get('/', function...)  
OR  
$controllers->get('', function...)
it automatically redirects to https://example.com/foo/ (with trailing slash).
It's very annoying. It makes run my middleware twice without need and
generating redundant requests.  
Can you fix it or provide a way to disable this new redirects at all?
