prove in many cases. At the same time, for some messages,
paths are independent and Markowitz utilizes the path diver-
sity to achieve better performance.
While Markowitz-Numeric and Markowitz have diﬀerent per-
formance, the diﬀerences are not generally signiﬁcant. To un-
derstand the importance of accounting for correlations, we con-
sider a modiﬁed version of Markowitz (labeled MkwIg) that
ignores any correlations between paths, and note that its per-
formance is notably degraded. This highlights the importance
of systematically incorporating correlations. As a ﬁnal note, we
see that Proportional performs worse in all cases.
In summary, the beneﬁts of using erasure coding are limited
because of dependencies among paths. In many cases, simple
replication will likely be suﬃcient, and the complexity of the
erasure coding based techniques may not be justiﬁed. How-
ever, if very high assurance is required, using erasure coding
techniques allows us to increase the “nines” of delivery success
(i.e., go from a success probability of .9 to one of .99).
8. SENSOR NETWORK SCENARIO
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss some early results obtained
by applying our ideas to address the reliable communication
problem in a multi-hop dense sensor network scenario. This
scenario is diﬀerent from the previous two cases as it represents
a case of partial failures. We consider a loss model in which
packet loss occurs because of poor channel quality. Poor chan-
nel quality may be the result of obstacles, interference, hidden
terminal problems, multi-path eﬀects, etc. Every link is char-
acterized by a success probability, which is the probability that

a transmitted packet is received successfully at the receiver. If
multiple code-blocks are sent over a contact opportunity, then
the resultant behavior can be approximated by a binomial dis-
tribution [24]. This is diﬀerent from the previous two scenarios
where Si were Bernoulli. We also assume that the sensors sleep
periodically with a low duty cycle to save energy [19]. This
causes frequent disconnection in the network and it represents
an instance of a DTN where no immediate feedback may be
possible.
Simulation Setup and Parameters
Our simulation topology is borrowed from a real 97 node de-
ployment of a sensor network in an oﬃce lab environment [15].
The sensor nodes are placed in a 40x16 foot grid with a grid
size of 8ft. We use prior results to characterize packet loss
based on distance [24]. The basic routing algorithm used was a
minimum-cost algorithm. Edge costs were deﬁned based on the
distance between the endpoints of edges. The algorithm was
extended to ﬁnd the k best edge-disjoint paths. We found that
the average number of paths from a node to the base-station
was 7, and the path loss rates ranged from 0.4 to 0.6. This is
consistent with an ongoing study to measure path loss rates for
that network [15]. r was chosen to be two.

Results
The mean failure rates for diﬀerent techniques and the per-
centiles (5th, 50th and the 95th) are shown in Figure 6. As ex-
pected, SRep has signiﬁcantly higher failure rates (95%). This
is natural because we only receive fragments of a message over
the two paths, and since erasure coding is not used, at least one
copy of each fragment is needed to be able to reconstruct the

message. This is similar to the situation in the MULE scenario
where splitting occurs (Section 6.2). We again use SRep-Code
to understand the eﬀect of a greedy allocation technique which
works by sending code blocks on the best r paths. SRep-Code
has a signiﬁcantly better performance with a failure rate of only
2.88%. The Markowitz approach again gives additional bene-
ﬁts, more evident in terms of higher percentiles. For example,
the 80th percentile (i.e., for 20% of the messages) failure prob-
ability for Markowitz was less than two percent and more than
six percent for SRep-Code.
9. SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The three scenarios are interesting because they exhibit a
range of network scales and path failure models. The MULE
scenario considers single-hop, uncorrelated delivery paths with-
out volume constraints. The SFO city bus scenario uses multi-
hop, correlated paths with volume constraints. Finally, the
sensor network scenario has a large number of disjoint routing
paths available, allowing us to explore partial path failures.
One consistent theme throughout our results is the existence
of three operating regimes (based on the concept of the product
p· r) that profoundly aﬀect the best choice. Figure 7 shows the
classiﬁcation of the eﬃcacy of the diﬀerent techniques in these
diﬀerent regimes.
The ﬁrst question we addressed is to determine the beneﬁts of
erasure coding in the various regimes. When paths have lower
probability (regime 1), erasure coding does not provide addi-
tional beneﬁts over simple replication, regardless of the number
of available paths. In the second regime, the situation is slightly
more complex, as the beneﬁts of erasure coding are only evi-
dent when there are many paths on which to split code blocks.
Finally, in the third regime, while all techniques achieve high
success probabilities, the erasure coding based techniques can
approach a near-perfect success rate.
An encouraging result is that our Markowitz technique is
able to handle all three regimes and performs close to optimal
in most cases. Using the Sharpe-Ratio as an alternate objec-
tive function turned out to be eﬃcient and eﬀective in captur-
ing complex aspects such as path dependencies. While simple
heuristics like the proportional approach may do well in certain
situations, in others they have notably worse performance. Fi-
nally, for the case of partial path failures and forced splitting
due to limited contact volume, the use of erasure coding is a
clear win.
Use of replication to improve reliability in a DTN context has
been suggested in recent work [8, 9]. To our knowledge, this
work is the ﬁrst attempt to systematically examine how repli-
cation and erasure coding can be used to combat uncertainties,
lack of information, and failures in DTN scenarios. We now dis-
cuss various related ﬁelds from which we draw our techniques.
Portfolio Theory
Modern portfolio theory has a vast literature and an extensive
survey is not possible here. The theory of eﬃcient frontiers
and utility maximization was developed by Henry Markowitz in
the late 1950s. The concept of the Sharpe-Ratio was proposed
by William Sharpe, in the context of stock-market equilibrium
and optimal investment when a bank provides a risk free rate
r. Markowitz and Sharpe (along with Merton Miller) won the
Nobel Prize for Economics in 1990 for this work.
To our knowledge, numerical search is the only method for
maximizing the Sharpe-Ratio if there are volume constraints.
However, unconstrained optimization is covered in detail in sev-
eral sources [1, 13, 6]. Furthermore, the existence of a unique
maximum on the eﬃcient frontier and the various approaches
for ﬁnding it using numerical methods are also covered in prior
work [13, 20].
Optimizing the utility function P rob(Y > c) for general dis-
tributions is not well studied due to the complex nature of the
distribution of Y . Most of the literature focuses on concave util-
ity functions expressed in terms of the mean and the variance of
the return Y [1, 6]. Some approaches discuss the minimization
of the shortfall probability P rob(Y  c) is discussed in litera-
ture dealing with reliability of k−out-of−n systems [11], where
systems fail if more than k components fail. The work focuses
on computing P rob(Y > c) for a given conﬁguration and not on
optimizing P rob(Y > c). We believe that the problem raised
here presents an interesting avenue for future work.
11. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this paper, we investigate the problem of improving the
probability of successful message delivery in DTNs with path
failures by applying a combination of erasure coding and repli-
cation. Although erasure coding is a well-known technique to
address failures in traditional networks, the notions of path fail-
ures and volume constraints in DTNs signiﬁcantly alter the best
solution approaches. With attention paid to these diﬀerences,
we formulate the optimal allocation problem of erasure code
blocks over multiple paths. Solving this problem, even for the
simple case of Bernoulli failures, turns out to be a challenging
task. To do so, we used a mixed integer program. Unfortu-
nately, it has too high a computational complexity to be prac-
tically useful, but it does serve as a yardstick to evaluate other
methods.
Our primary solution technique relies on ideas from modern
portfolio theory. This allows us to optimally solve the problem
for a Gaussian failure model and gives us good approximations
for other cases. In spite of a complex derivation, the ﬁnal al-
gorithm is simple and elegant. It is quite general and accounts
for path dependencies and volume constraints. Through sim-
ulations of various DTN scenarios, we demonstrate that this
approach oﬀers signiﬁcant beneﬁts over simple heuristics such
as greedy and proportional allocation and works well in most
scenarios. Interestingly, a similar problem arises in two other
contexts; replica placement in wide-area storage systems and
virtual node mapping in distributed hash tables (DHTs). The
ideas presented here should provide useful insights for these
problems as well.
This paper is only a ﬁrst step in understanding the reliability
issues in DTN. Our formulation assumes that the underlying
probabilities remain constant over time. Violations of this as-
sumption present additional challenges we have not addressed
here, and some form of adaptation might be required to handle
dynamic conditions.
In investigating the combinatorial version (Bernoulli case) of
our problem, we were unable to compute optimal solutions at
any large scale. Eﬃcient approximation algorithms (e.g. using
Chernoﬀ bounds) present an encouraging avenue of exploration
for this and related problems. Another interesting direction
would be to alter the optimization criteria. One possibility
would be to to optimize the replication factor given constraints
on delivery probabilities. The analysis included here provides
hints along these lines, but this direction is still wide open.
Finally, we have some experience with the impact of erasure
coding on the delay distribution of message delivery in oppor-
tunistic DTN networks, which we discuss separately in [22].
This is another potentially rich direction for future work.
