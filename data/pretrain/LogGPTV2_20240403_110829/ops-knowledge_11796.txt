User: Use Python to write a script to periodically back up the database and store the backup file to a specified location.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script for backing up the MongoDB database and storing the backup file to a specified location: ```python import os import datetime import subprocess # Set the backup file storage directory backup_dir = '/path/to/backup/directory/ ' # Get the current date and time now = datetime.datetime.now() # Create a backup filename filename = 'backup-' + now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S' ) + '.gz' # build mongodump command mongodump_cmd = ['mongodump', '--gzip', '--archive=' + os.path.join(backup_dir, filename)] # execute mongodump command try: subprocess.check_call (mongodump_cmd) print('Backup created successfully!') except subprocess.CalledProcessError: print('Backup failed!') ``` This script uses the mongodump command to back up the MongoDB database, and stores the backup file in the specified directory, the backup file name Contains the current datetime and the `.gz` file extension. You can use scheduled tasks or any other scheduler to automate running this script to take regular backups of your MongoDB database.
