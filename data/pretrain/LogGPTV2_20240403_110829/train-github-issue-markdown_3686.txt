On the commit `4376c2e`, Adding a backref into a `viewonly` relationship was
deprecated to avoid the issue where a backref one2many collection is modified,
but the respective many2one relationship cannot be assigned.
However, if the `backref` is `lazy="dynamic"`, there is no risk of the
collection in the one2many side of the relationship being modified in this
case, so forgive me if I misunderstood the deprecation, but I think it is
unwarranted in this specific case.
Conversely, if the `backref` is `lazy="select"` but both sides of the
relationship are `viewonly`, then there should also be no harm, hence no
warning, but you might consider this a separate issue.
Here is a simple example file showing the warning that I think is unwarranted
(`.txt` added so it can be attached to a github issue):
