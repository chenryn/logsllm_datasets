##### Description of the problem
Rendering an InstancedBufferGeometry with no (used) attributes does not
render.
This happens when a shader uses only (implicit) gl_InstanceID and/or
gl_VertexID,  
and user program establishes count with 'geom.maxInstancedCount = ...'  
(It only applies to WebGL2 as earlier shaders do not support this.)
The internal value geometry._maxInstanceCount is never established, so  
var instanceCount = Math.min( geometry.instanceCount,
geometry._maxInstanceCount );  
does not set a sensible value.
A workaround is to set geometry._maxInstanceCount in the user's program (eg to
Infinity),  
but this is obviously not the correct solution.
##
With earlier versions of three.js (eg 109) a program could provide a 'dummy'
attribute not actually used in the shader to establish count; but 117 is
clever enough to realize this dummy is not used, and therefore does not take
account of it in the count calculation.
