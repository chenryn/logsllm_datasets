User: How to configure Nginx reverse proxy and explain what it does?
Assistant: The steps to configure the Nginx reverse proxy are as follows: 1. Install Nginx; 2. Modify the Nginx configuration file, add the server block under the http module, and specify the host address and port of the proxy; 3. Configure the reverse proxy in the location module and specify the proxy address and port. For example, a simple Nginx reverse proxy configuration file is as follows: ``` http { server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://10.0.0.2:8080; } } } ``` This configuration The file will forward the request to the web application running on 10.0.0.2 and return the response to the client. The function of the Nginx reverse proxy is to forward the client request to the backend server, so that the client sees the response from the proxy server. The benefits of this are: 1. Improve security and prevent the back-end server from being directly exposed to the public network; 2. Reduce the burden on the back-end server and forward the request to multiple back-end servers to achieve load balancing; 3. Realize the request Cache, cache the result of the request in the proxy server to avoid multiple requests to the server.
