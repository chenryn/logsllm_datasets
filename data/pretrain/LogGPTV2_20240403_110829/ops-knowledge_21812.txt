User: I have written a Python script that checks a certain e-mail address and passes new e-mails to an external program.  How can I get this script to execute 24/7, such as turning it into daemon or service in Linux.  Would I also need a loop that never ends in the program, or can it be done by just having the code re executed multiple times?
Assistant: how about using $nohup command on linux?
I use it for running my commands on my Bluehost server.
Please advice if I am wrong.
