involved.  
Multi-agency interoperability communication 
systems encompass the ability to exchange 
information among fixed facilities, mobile 
platforms, and portable (personal) devices. 
2.1.1 Importance of Multi-Agency 
Communication 
Effective and efficient emergency response 
requires coordination, communication, and 
sharing of information among numerous 
public safety agencies.  Thousands of inci-
dents that require mutual aid and coordi-
nated response happen each day.  
High profile incidents, such as bombings or 
plane crashes, test the ability of emergency 
service 
organizations 
to 
mount 
well-
coordinated responses.  In an era where 
technology can bring news, current events, 
and entertainment to the farthest reaches of 
the world, many law enforcement, fire-
fighter, emergency medical service, and 
other emergency response personnel can-
not communicate with each other during 
routine operations let alone major emergen-
cies. 
Voice communication is not the only issue.  
Advances in technology have placed an in-
creased dependence on the sharing of data, 
images, and video.  As a result, interopera-
bility (the ability of two or more organiza-
tions to communicate and share informa-
tion, be it voice, data, images, or video) has 
been brought to the forefront as a key issue 
for our nation's emergency response agen-
cies. 
2.1.2 The Interoperability Solution 
A fundamental interoperability challenge 
today is wireless voice communication 
among agencies that have different radio 
systems operating on various radio fre-
quencies.  It is intended that the AGILE pro-
gram will ultimately address this issue 
through adoption of interoperability stan-
dards.  However, while those standards are 
being developed, other mechanisms are 
needed that can address the interoperability 
requirements.  One solution is the Gateway 
Switch device, also called an audio matrix 
or cross band switch, that links different ra-
dio systems. 
Not unlike a dispatcher's patch panel, the 
Gateway Switch device simply passes base 
band audio signals from the receiver portion 
of one radio to the transmitter portion of a 
dissimilar radio system.  For example, audio 
from the receiver function of a Very High 
Frequency (VHF) transceiver can be passed 
to the transmitter circuitry of an Ultra High 
Frequency (UHF) transceiver.  An advan-
tage of the Gateway Switch device over the 
dispatcher's patch panel is that it requires 
no manual intervention once configured. 
The Gateway Switch device automatically 
routes voice calls from one radio system to 
another via control signals input by a radio 
user.  It will also allow a connection be-
tween radios and telephone or cellular 
phones, or vice versa.  In addition, the 
Gateway Switch has a degree of versatility 
that is not available via the dispatch patch 
panel.  
The Gateway Switch device can be config-
ured either as a fixed base unit or for use in 
a mobile platform that is transportable in a 
van, sports utility vehicle or command vehi-
cle.  In a transportable mode, the Gateway 
Switch device becomes a mobile repeater, 
allowing different radio systems to commu-
nicate in a wide geographical radius around 
an incident.

2.2 ACU-1000 & TRP-1000 Inter-
operability Communication 
Systems 
This handbook discusses both the fixed 
base and mobile interoperable communica-
tions systems.  The ACU-1000 Modular In-
terconnect System (as shown in Figure 2-1) 
is designed for fixed base operations.  This 
system, manufactured by JPS Communica-
tions, Inc., contains the Gateway Switch, 
and is capable of interconnecting diverse 
radio, telephone, and cellular units to allow 
multi-agency communication.  This system 
has the added benefit of adding a backup 
capability to regular communication and 
dispatch systems. 
The TRP-1000 Transportable Radio Inter-
connect System puts the Gateway Switch in 
a shock-resistant case for mobile transpor-
tation and operation.  It incorporates all the 
same functions as the ACU-1000 system, 
plus it comes standard with five UHF and 
five VHF radios for field use. 
The greatest asset of both the ACU-1000 
and the TRP-1000 systems is their ability to 
provide communications interoperability be-
tween HF, VHF low band, VHF high band, 
UHF, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, trunking talk-
groups, and encrypted networks. 
2.3 ACU-1000 Modular Intercon-
nect System 
The ACU-1000 units are designed to inter-
connect dissimilar radio systems by distrib-
uting the audio or voice-band signals from 
selected radios or telephone connections to 
other specified radios or telephones con-
nected via the Gateway Switch.  By con-
necting directly to each radio's control cir-
cuitry, the ACU-1000 can detect when a ra-
dio on the switch is receiving audio (to be 
distributed to other radios) and assert the 
"push-to-talk" on those radios to which the 
audio is to be transmitted.

2.4 TRP-1000 Transportable Ra-
dio Interconnect System 
The TRP-1000 is a package consisting of 
one or more transportable cases that in-
cludes multiple radios pre-wired to a Gate-
way Switch.  The radios, which cover all 
possible frequency bands or interoperations 
needed, can be cross-connected through 
the Gateway Switch. 
The TRP-1000 (as shown in Figure 2-2) 
contains multiple radios that can be quickly 
programmed to the (transmit and receive) 
frequencies of involved agencies.  These 
radios can then be cross-connected by the 
built-in Gateway Switch in a variety of ways, 
including a mixture of 2-way and conference 
conversations as well as a mix of perma-
nent and temporary connections to include 
radios, telephones, and cellular phones.

2.4.2 Potential Applications of the 
Interoperable Communication 
Systems 
Both the ACU-1000 and the TRP-1000 sys-
tems are excellent tools for emergency 
agencies responding to an incident requiring 
coordination among multiple agencies.  The 
ACU/TRP-1000 systems provide crossband 
operation between agencies as diverse as 
FEMA, Red Cross, the National Guard, local 
emergency management, law enforcement, 
fire departments, and emergency medical 
services, as well as other public service 
agencies that might be involved. 
In instances where it is needed, the 
ACU/TRP-1000 systems can assist in 911 
call center applications.  The ACU/TRP-
1000 systems can prevent overloading of 
the local 911 center communications circuits 
during a large-scale emergency by provid-
ing direct radio interoperability for emer-
gency personnel outside the 911 center's 
normal communications systems.  For in-
stance, the ACU/TRP-1000 systems can 
facilitate interoperable communication at a 
hazardous materials spill in which HazMat, 
EMS, fire, and law enforcement personnel 
operate on alternate cross-connected fre-
quencies.  The interoperability system al-
lows the 911 center to return to handling 
normal emergency call traffic rather than 
serving as the network communication cen-
ter for the HazMat incident.  
ACU/TRP-1000 systems can be set up 
within minutes to solve several communica-
tion problems such as: 
• 
first response communications 
interoperability during the initial 
24 to 48 hours of an emergency 
• 
supplementing or extending the 
reach of fixed base radio com-
munications coverage 
• 
transportable communications 
backup with flexible system con-
figuration 
• 
enhancing local, state and fed-
eral interoperability during emer-
gency situations and special 
events.

3 ESTABLISHING INTEROP-
ERABILITY 
The advents of more and more multiple 
agency emergency response incidents have 
brought with them the need of multi-agency 
inter-communication. This dynamic compo-
nent of multi-agency emergency response 
has become a major problem. 
Now, with assistance of new technology, the 
capability to have seamless communica-
tions across the full radio spectrum is possi-
ble.  However, many jurisdictions are reluc-
tant to establish new operational ap-
proaches and implement new communica-
tions methods. 
Based on ACU/TRP-1000 System demon-
strations, the Office for Domestic Prepared-
ness (ODP) funded a pilot program to place 
approximately 50 units in around 10 jurisdic-
tions to determine the practicality of com-
munications interoperability and the func-
tionality of the ACU/TRP-1000 System. 
Every jurisdiction that received the units for 
testing and deployment had positive evalua-
tions of the equipment.  Many of the jurisdic-
tions are well advanced in their plans to de-
ploy the unit, and some have devised crea-
tive approaches to using the equipment.  A 
few jurisdictions have passed the formal 
implementation stage and have developed 
operating procedures that incorporate use 
of the system into their emergency re-
sponse plans. 
3.1 Set-Up and Operation 
Emergency response agencies provided 
with the ACU/TRP-1000 System reported 
minimal problems in setting-up the unit for 
use.  Many agencies indicated they were 
able to operate the unit within minutes after 
unpacking the equipment.  Other agencies 
had minor set-up issues that were quickly 
resolved by contacting JPS Communica-
tions for technical assistance. 
The first out-of-the-box initial setup, pro-
gramming, and installation of additional ra-
dios may require a communications special-
ist/technician.  However, operation of the 
unit once assembled is easily handled by 
dispatchers or other communications staff.  
Brief training on use of the unit is generally 
sufficient for operating.  Most users find the 
software easy to understand and intuitive to 
use. 
3.1.1 Cabling 
The TRP-1000 comes with 10 multi-channel 
conventional radios pre-connected to the 
unit and covers a wide range of frequencies.  
All of these radios can be programmed to 
various jurisdictions' frequencies.  Additional 
radios can be added (to cover other fre-
quencies or to expand capability) of the 
TRP-1000 by connecting them via a cable 
connection to an open port on the system, 
or by replacing one of the radios supplied 
with the unit.  
Constructing the proper cabling to connect 
these additional radios to the TRP-1000 re-
quires the ability to read and interpret elec-
trical schematics.  This is a simple but criti-
cal task for a radio technician.  This task 
involves creating a connection cable (or re-
wiring an existing cable) for each radio 
brand or type so that it can interface with 
the TRP-1000 generic audio port.  One ca-
ble is needed for every additional brand or 
type of radio connected to the TRP-1000.

toring equipment connected to TRP-1000 
system. 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 3-2 
It is recommended that new users develop a 
collection of pre-constructed cables to be 
transported with the TRP-1000 that can in-
terface with radios from neighboring jurisdic-
tions as well as state and federal assets.  
As with most emergency response issues, 
pre-planning to handle communications 
needs will speed the integration of other 
agencies into the system. 
3.1.2 Interconnection Schematics 
The manufacturer of the ACU/TRP-1000 
system, JPS Communications, notes that 
many of the schematics supplied by radio 
manufacturers for pin-out configurations are 
not correct.  This can prevent proper con-
nection of the radio to the TRP-1000 unit.  
JPS will provide schematics for any radio if 
the jurisdiction wishes to make their own 
cables, or JPS will provide pricing for pre-
manufactured cables if the agency wishes 
to purchase them.  
The user should check model numbers 
carefully as similar looking radios and simi-
lar sounding model numbers may have 
completely different pin-out configurations 
requiring separate cables.  They should 
contact JPS with any problems in connect-
ing radios to the unit.  Several jurisdictions 
were able to quickly resolve their connection 
problems with one call to JPS staff, which 
provided fax versions of correct pin-out con-
figurations. 
3.1.3 Security Issues - Encryption 
Since the ACU/TRP-1000 systems operate 
on the principle of taking the analog voice 
signal from any radio, telephone or other 
electronic equipment, and re-transmitting 
this signal over another radio channel, it is 
possible to connect them to a radio operat-
ing on an encrypted system, or to connect 
encrypted radios from separate systems 
together.  
Because there is the capability of connect-
ing an encrypted radio system to a non-
encrypted system, use of JPS equipment 
with encrypted systems should be carefully 
engineered to limit the system only to con-
necting one encrypted system to another.  
JPS has recommendations for setup and 
operation of the system using encrypted 
radios to minimize the potential for inadver-
tently interconnecting encrypted radios into
