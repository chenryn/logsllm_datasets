### Multi-Agency Interoperability Communication Systems

Multi-agency interoperability communication systems facilitate the exchange of information among fixed facilities, mobile platforms, and portable (personal) devices.

#### 2.1.1 Importance of Multi-Agency Communication

Effective and efficient emergency response requires coordination, communication, and information sharing among numerous public safety agencies. Thousands of incidents that necessitate mutual aid and coordinated responses occur daily. High-profile events, such as bombings or plane crashes, test the ability of emergency service organizations to mount well-coordinated responses. In an era where technology can disseminate news, current events, and entertainment to the farthest corners of the world, many law enforcement, firefighters, emergency medical services, and other emergency response personnel still struggle to communicate with each other during routine operations, let alone major emergencies.

The issue is not limited to voice communication. Advances in technology have increased the reliance on data, images, and video sharing. Consequently, interoperability—the ability of two or more organizations to communicate and share information, whether it be voice, data, images, or video—has become a critical concern for our nation's emergency response agencies.

#### 2.1.2 The Interoperability Solution

A fundamental challenge in achieving interoperability today is the wireless voice communication among agencies using different radio systems operating on various frequencies. The AGILE program aims to address this issue through the adoption of interoperability standards. However, while these standards are being developed, other mechanisms are needed to meet the immediate interoperability requirements. One solution is the Gateway Switch device, also known as an audio matrix or cross-band switch, which links different radio systems.

Similar to a dispatcher's patch panel, the Gateway Switch device simply passes baseband audio signals from the receiver portion of one radio to the transmitter portion of another. For example, audio from the receiver function of a Very High Frequency (VHF) transceiver can be passed to the transmitter circuitry of an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) transceiver. The advantage of the Gateway Switch over a dispatcher's patch panel is that it requires no manual intervention once configured. It automatically routes voice calls from one radio system to another via control signals input by a radio user and can also connect radios with telephone or cellular phones, and vice versa. Additionally, the Gateway Switch offers greater versatility than a dispatch patch panel.

The Gateway Switch can be configured as a fixed base unit or for use in a mobile platform, such as a van, sports utility vehicle, or command vehicle. In a transportable mode, the Gateway Switch acts as a mobile repeater, enabling different radio systems to communicate over a wide geographical radius around an incident.

#### 2.2 ACU-1000 & TRP-1000 Interoperability Communication Systems

This handbook discusses both fixed base and mobile interoperable communication systems. The ACU-1000 Modular Interconnect System (Figure 2-1) is designed for fixed base operations. Manufactured by JPS Communications, Inc., it includes the Gateway Switch and can interconnect diverse radio, telephone, and cellular units, allowing multi-agency communication. This system also provides a backup capability to regular communication and dispatch systems.

The TRP-1000 Transportable Radio Interconnect System places the Gateway Switch in a shock-resistant case for mobile transportation and operation. It incorporates all the functions of the ACU-1000 system and comes standard with five UHF and five VHF radios for field use.

Both the ACU-1000 and TRP-1000 systems excel in providing communications interoperability between HF, VHF low band, VHF high band, UHF, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, trunking talk groups, and encrypted networks.

#### 2.3 ACU-1000 Modular Interconnect System

The ACU-1000 units are designed to interconnect dissimilar radio systems by distributing audio or voice-band signals from selected radios or telephone connections to other specified radios or telephones via the Gateway Switch. By connecting directly to each radio's control circuitry, the ACU-1000 can detect when a radio on the switch is receiving audio and assert the "push-to-talk" function on those radios to which the audio is to be transmitted.

#### 2.4 TRP-1000 Transportable Radio Interconnect System

The TRP-1000 is a package consisting of one or more transportable cases that include multiple radios pre-wired to a Gateway Switch. These radios cover all possible frequency bands or interoperations needed and can be cross-connected through the Gateway Switch.

The TRP-1000 (Figure 2-2) contains multiple radios that can be quickly programmed to the transmit and receive frequencies of involved agencies. These radios can then be cross-connected by the built-in Gateway Switch in various ways, including a mixture of two-way and conference conversations, as well as permanent and temporary connections involving radios, telephones, and cellular phones.

#### 2.4.2 Potential Applications of the Interoperable Communication Systems

Both the ACU-1000 and TRP-1000 systems are valuable tools for emergency agencies responding to incidents requiring coordination among multiple agencies. They provide cross-band operation between diverse agencies such as FEMA, Red Cross, the National Guard, local emergency management, law enforcement, fire departments, and emergency medical services, as well as other public service agencies.

In large-scale emergencies, the ACU/TRP-1000 systems can assist in 911 call center applications by preventing the overloading of local 911 center communications circuits. For example, during a hazardous materials spill, the ACU/TRP-1000 systems can facilitate interoperable communication among HazMat, EMS, fire, and law enforcement personnel, allowing the 911 center to handle normal emergency call traffic.

The ACU/TRP-1000 systems can be set up within minutes to solve several communication problems, including:
- First response communications interoperability during the initial 24 to 48 hours of an emergency.
- Supplementing or extending the reach of fixed base radio communications coverage.
- Providing transportable communications backup with flexible system configuration.
- Enhancing local, state, and federal interoperability during emergencies and special events.

### 3 Establishing Interoperability

The increasing number of multi-agency emergency response incidents has highlighted the need for multi-agency inter-communication, which has become a significant challenge. With the help of new technology, seamless communications across the full radio spectrum are now possible. However, many jurisdictions are hesitant to adopt new operational approaches and implement new communication methods.

Based on demonstrations of the ACU/TRP-1000 System, the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) funded a pilot program to place approximately 50 units in about 10 jurisdictions to evaluate the practicality of communications interoperability and the functionality of the ACU/TRP-1000 System. Every jurisdiction that received the units for testing and deployment provided positive evaluations of the equipment. Many jurisdictions are well-advanced in their plans to deploy the unit, and some have devised creative approaches to using the equipment. A few jurisdictions have passed the formal implementation stage and have developed operating procedures that incorporate the use of the system into their emergency response plans.

#### 3.1 Set-Up and Operation

Emergency response agencies reported minimal problems in setting up the ACU/TRP-1000 System. Many agencies were able to operate the unit within minutes after unpacking the equipment. Others had minor setup issues that were quickly resolved with technical assistance from JPS Communications.

The initial setup, programming, and installation of additional radios may require a communications specialist/technician. However, once assembled, the unit can be easily operated by dispatchers or other communications staff with brief training. Most users find the software easy to understand and intuitive to use.

##### 3.1.1 Cabling

The TRP-1000 comes with 10 multi-channel conventional radios pre-connected to the unit, covering a wide range of frequencies. These radios can be programmed to various jurisdictions' frequencies. Additional radios can be added to cover other frequencies or expand the capability of the TRP-1000 by connecting them via a cable connection to an open port on the system, or by replacing one of the radios supplied with the unit.

Constructing the proper cabling to connect these additional radios to the TRP-1000 requires the ability to read and interpret electrical schematics. This task involves creating a connection cable (or rewiring an existing cable) for each radio brand or type so that it can interface with the TRP-1000 generic audio port. One cable is needed for every additional brand or type of radio connected to the TRP-1000.

It is recommended that new users develop a collection of pre-constructed cables to be transported with the TRP-1000, which can interface with radios from neighboring jurisdictions, as well as state and federal assets. Pre-planning for communication needs will expedite the integration of other agencies into the system.

##### 3.1.2 Interconnection Schematics

JPS Communications, the manufacturer of the ACU/TRP-1000 system, notes that many of the schematics supplied by radio manufacturers for pin-out configurations are incorrect, which can prevent proper connection of the radio to the TRP-1000 unit. JPS will provide schematics for any radio if the jurisdiction wishes to make their own cables, or they can provide pricing for pre-manufactured cables if the agency prefers to purchase them.

Users should carefully check model numbers, as similar-looking radios and model numbers may have different pin-out configurations requiring separate cables. Any connection problems should be addressed by contacting JPS staff, who can provide correct pin-out configurations via fax.

##### 3.1.3 Security Issues - Encryption

Since the ACU/TRP-1000 systems operate by taking the analog voice signal from any radio, telephone, or other electronic equipment and re-transmitting it over another radio channel, it is possible to connect them to a radio operating on an encrypted system or to connect encrypted radios from separate systems together.

Because there is the potential to connect an encrypted radio system to a non-encrypted system, the use of JPS equipment with encrypted systems should be carefully engineered to limit the system only to connecting one encrypted system to another. JPS has recommendations for setup and operation of the system using encrypted radios to minimize the risk of inadvertently interconnecting encrypted radios into non-encrypted systems.
