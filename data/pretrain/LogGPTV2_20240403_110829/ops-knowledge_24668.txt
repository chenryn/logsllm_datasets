User: What editors are best for use with the "Edit" button in GoogleAppEngineLauncher for Mac? A good editor would preferably be able to edit Python and YAML and be able to open directories.
Assistant: Why not use your favorite editor? Textmate or gvim or emacs anything should do here. All them support Python and YAML syntax.
