User: I am developing a load balancing between multiple controllers in sdn. Once a load is calculated on a controller-1 I need to migrate some part of that to controller-2. I have created the topology using mininet and running 2 remote pox controllers one on 127.0.0.1:6633 and other on 127.0.0.1:6634.How do I communicate between these controllers? How can I send load information of controller-1 to controller-2 and migrate some flows there?
Assistant: POX is not a distributed controller. I would really recommend you to migrate immediately to ONOS or opendaylight. You would implement your solution on top of ONOS.
