Abstract
Online social network (OSN) accounts are often more user-
centric than other types of online accounts (e.g., email ac-
counts) because they present a number of demographic at-
tributes such as age, gender, location, and occupation. While
these attributes allow for more meaningful online interactions,
they can also be used by malicious parties to craft various
types of abuse. To understand the effects of demographic
attributes on attacker behavior in stolen social accounts, we
devised a method to instrument and monitor such accounts.
We then created, instrumented, and deployed more than 1000
Facebook accounts, and exposed them to criminals. Our re-
sults conﬁrm that victim demographic traits indeed inﬂuence
the way cybercriminals abuse their accounts. For example,
we ﬁnd that cybercriminals that access teen accounts write
messages and posts more than the ones accessing adult ac-
counts, and attackers that compromise male accounts perform
disruptive activities such as changing some of their proﬁle
information more than the ones that access female accounts.
This knowledge could potentially help online services develop
new models to characterize benign and malicious activity
across various demographic attributes, and thus automatically
classify future activity.
1 Introduction
Social accounts are almost indispensable in our daily lives.
Discovering old and new friends, consuming news, and secur-
ing the next lucrative job are a few of the many activities that
social accounts facilitate. Compared to webmail and instant
messaging accounts, social accounts provide much more than
messaging functionality alone. Social accounts also accumu-
late personal information over time which unfortunately puts
them within the sight of cybercriminals.
In this paper, we aim to understand what happens to so-
cial accounts after cybercriminals acquire credentials to them
through illicit means. Speciﬁcally, we focus on understanding
how the demographic attributes of stolen accounts inﬂuence
the activity of criminals that connect to them. To this end we
created, deployed, and monitored 1008 realistic decoy Face-
book accounts (for ethical reasons, it is not possible for us to
study accounts that belong to real persons, to avoid harming
them). We incorporated various age and gender conﬁgurations
in the accounts. To lure criminals into interacting with the
accounts, we leaked credentials to a subset of them on the
Surface Web and Dark Web, mimicking the modus operandi
of cybercriminals that distribute stolen account credentials.
We monitored the accounts for six months, extracted compre-
hensive activity records of people who visited the accounts,
and analyzed those records ofﬂine.
Our research questions are as follows. How can we char-
acterize the behavior of criminals in stolen accounts? Do
differences in account demographics (age and gender) affect
the activity of criminals in compromised social accounts? For
how long do criminals stay in social accounts after logging
in? What is the nature of content that they search for? What
is the nature of content that they post?
In the course of experiments, we observed 322 unique ac-
cesses to 284 accounts. We show that the age and gender of
an account owner indeed have a relationship with the types of
actions that criminals carry out in the account; for example,
attackers tend to search the friend list and start chats when
interacting with teen accounts more than with adult ones, and
perform disruptive activities while interacting with male pro-
ﬁles (e.g., editing their proﬁle), while we never observed this
behavior for female accounts. Our ﬁndings suggest that pro-
ﬁle attributes have an inﬂuence on the actions that attackers
take when compromising accounts, and open up future in-
teresting research directions in both better understanding the
modus operandi of attackers and developing better mitigations
against account hijacking.
Key Lesson. Age and gender differences (in victims) inﬂu-
ence the way cybercriminals behave when they access stolen
Facebook accounts. This is in line with existing research liter-
ature which shows that age and gender are signiﬁcant factors
in cybercrime and online abuse victimization [37, 51, 59]. In
view of this, we propose that mitigation systems and inter-

ventions should be customized along various demographic
groups. In other words, we need to evolve security systems
away from defending the mythical “average user” towards de-
veloping adaptive defense systems that address the signiﬁcant
differences in cybercrime victimization.
Contributions. First, we present a system to deploy and mon-
itor honeypot accounts on Facebook. Our approach can be
ported to other social networks to help understand the use of
stolen accounts. Second, we instrument over 1000 Facebook
accounts and collect 322 unique accesses over a period of
six months. Third, we analyze how different demographic
traits inﬂuence the way attackers interact with compromised
Facebook accounts. Fourth, we put our results in the context
of existing research, and discuss the need to develop tailored
mitigation systems along the demographic attributes of users
of online services.
2 Background
In this section, we ﬁrst motivate our work in light of previ-
ous research. We then discuss related work and introduce
Facebook accounts and the tools that we use to build our
measurement infrastructure. Finally, we discuss our threat
model.
2.1 Motivation
The existing research literature has explored various factors
that inﬂuence cybercrime victimization. Victims suffer from
different harms depending on their age, gender, and personal-
ity. Henson et al. [29] surveyed 10K undergraduate college
students on their use of OSNs. They show that male and
female users utilize OSNs in different ways, especially re-
garding the type and amount of content they upload, their
ﬂirting behavior, and the amount of time they spend on OSNs.
Lévesque et al. [37] studied factors in malware victimization:
they demonstrate that age and gender inﬂuence the likelihood
malware victimization. In particular, Lévesque et al. show that
men are at more risk of encountering malware than women,
across most types of malware. Multiple studies show that
women are disproportionately targeted by sexual harassment
and stalking online [22, 36, 51], and that younger people are
more likely to receive online harassment [51].
Age also plays a signiﬁcant role in victimization. Näsi et
al. [40] reported that younger people are more likely to be
victims than the older ones (participants were selected from
people between ages 15 and 30). Oliveira et el. [41] demon-
strated that older women are more susceptible to phishing
attacks than people from other age groups. On the other hand,
Sheng et al. [45] showed that younger people (18 to 25 years
old) are more likely to be victims of phishing attacks.
On a related note, van de Weijer and Leukfeldt [54] studied
the Big Five personality traits as factors related to the like-
lihood of cybercrime victimization. They reported conscien-
tiousness and emotional stability (lower scores) and openness
to new experiences (higher scores) as factors that predict cy-
bercrime victimization. Egelman and Peer [24] dispelled the
myth of the “average user,” and proposed a targeted approach
to nudge individual users towards better security and privacy
controls. Although [54] and [24] disagree on the utility of
the Big Five personality traits, they both point to the need for
individualized interventions for users and victims alike.
Since age, gender, and personality play a signiﬁcant role
in online victimization, it is therefore logical to expect that
the behavior of a criminal on breaching a speciﬁc online ac-
count would depend on those attributes (of the victim). The
existing research literature has focused more on victims and
their susceptibility to online crimes and abuse; instead, we
study how the demographic attributes of a victim account
inﬂuences the behavior of criminals. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst paper that explores such activity within
Facebook accounts. In the following section, we highlight
existing literature in account compromise.
2.2 Related Work
Account Takeover. Cybercriminals gain access to online ac-
counts through various means, including information-stealing
malware [15, 47], data breaches [27, 55], and manual account
hijacking [18]. Redmiles [43], via qualitative interviews, stud-
ied how people respond to attacks on their Facebook accounts.
Thomas et al. [52] examined suspended accounts on Twitter
and thus characterized spam accounts and techniques that
spam actors rely on. Social spam and fake accounts have been
studied extensively [16,35,53,56,57,61]. Work has been con-
ducted on understanding the threat of compromised accounts
and developing systems to detect such attacks [23,49]. Instead,
we focus on understanding how the demographic attributes
of online accounts inﬂuence the activity of criminals when
they compromise such accounts; we explored age range and
gender variables but this approach could be extended to other
demographic attributes as well. In the next section, we high-
light a number of papers that employed honeypot approaches
related to ours.
Honeypots. DeBlasio et al. [20] studied compromised web-
sites by leveraging honey webmail accounts. Han et al. [28]
studied the phishing ecosystem by deploying sandboxed
phishing kits and recording live interactions of various par-
ties that accessed those kits. Other papers studied the behav-
ior of criminals in compromised webmail and cloud docu-
ment accounts by deploying honey accounts and honey docu-
ments [18,34,42]. In this paper, we focus on the inﬂuence that
demographic traits have on the activity of malicious actors
accessing compromised accounts; elements that the online
services studied by previous work did not have available.
Kedrowitsch et al. [32] explored ways to improve Linux
sandboxes for evasive malware analysis. Cao et al. [19] de-
ployed an operational network honeypot to automatically

detect and evade SSH attack attempts. Barron and Niki-
forakis [14] deployed honeypot machines and observed how
the system properties of those machines inﬂuenced the be-
havior of attackers. In this paper, we focus on compromised
social network accounts instead of compromised machines.
2.3 Facebook Accounts
A potential Facebook user ﬁrst creates an account and an as-
sociated proﬁle. Afterwards, they can send friend requests to
their peers. They can post updates on their proﬁle timeline, for
instance, by writing text, uploading a photo, or posting a URL
(or a combination of those actions). Facebook also allows
users to send private messages to their friends via Messen-
ger (Facebook’s messaging application). Users can click like
(and other “reactions”) on posts, photos, and other content
of interest to them. Facebook usage is not limited to individ-
ual users. Informal groups, businesses, and corporate entities
can also maintain Facebook presence by creating pages and
groups. Users can search for, and connect to, friends, groups,
and pages they are interested in. These features, among others,
highlight the social nature of Facebook.
2.4 Test Accounts
In addition to regular accounts, Facebook provides sandboxed
accounts that are disconnected from their main social graph.
These accounts, known as test accounts, are similar to real
accounts, but exist in an isolated environment (a sandbox).
Hence, they cannot connect to regular Facebook accounts, but
can connect to other test accounts (i.e., as “friends”). They are
often used for testing purposes, for instance, in security vul-
nerability testing [6]. The inherent isolation of test accounts
makes them particularly suitable for our studies in understand-
ing malicious activity in compromised social accounts, since
it ensures that real users will not be harmed in any way during
experiments, and this matches our ethics requirements for
studies of this nature. We discuss these ethical considerations
in Section 3.5. At the same time, we ensure that the accounts
look believable. Facebook also provides a dashboard for man-
aging test accounts. The dashboard, which is accessible only
from a real Facebook account, allows the account manager to
reset passwords of test accounts under their control.
Although test accounts look similar to real Facebook ac-
counts, there are limits to their capabilities. Since test ac-
counts are disconnected from the regular Facebook graph,
attempts to interact with regular accounts will fail. For in-
stance, attempts to search for a real account or fan page will
not succeed. Nevertheless, such search terms will be recorded
in the test account’s activity records and will be available to
the researcher in control of the test accounts. Also, attempts
to authenticate to other Facebook-afﬁliated platforms (e.g.,
Instagram) using test accounts will fail, while such attempts
via real accounts will succeed (for valid account credentials).
Despite these limitations, test accounts provide a level of re-
alism that is close to that of real Facebook accounts, hence are
a good ﬁt for this paper. Therefore, we only use test accounts
to conduct this research.
2.5 Download Your Information (DYI)
A Facebook user may desire to download and review their
own account data and activity. To facilitate this, Facebook
accounts present a built-in tool known as Download Your In-
formation (DYI) which allows users to request and download
a compressed archive containing their account data and activ-
ity over time [1]. The DYI tool is available via the Settings
menu of Facebook accounts. After requesting and download-
ing the compressed archive (DYI archive), the user can then
uncompress the archive ofﬂine and peruse its contents. It is
usually structured like an ofﬂine web site organized in direc-
tories (sections) and web pages that can be viewed ofﬂine in
a Web browser. Alternatively, DYI data can be downloaded
in JavaScript Object Notation format (JSON).
A DYI archive provides information on login times, IP
addresses, user-agent strings, messages, group chats, timeline
posts, proﬁle edits, and photo uploads, among others. It pro-
vides a comprehensive record of activity within a Facebook
account. However, it does not provide 100% coverage of all
observable phenomena within a Facebook account—for in-
stance, it does not record page scrolling information. Despite
this, DYI archives constitute a rich source of information for
our experiments. For these reasons, we rely on DYI function-
ality in Facebook accounts to retrieve activity data from test
accounts at the end of experiments (see Section 3.2). Note
that we also refer to test accounts as honey accounts.
2.6 Threat Model
Attackers compromise credentials of online accounts through
phishing attacks, information-stealing malware, network at-
tacks, and database breaches, among other ways [21, 47, 49].
Afterwards, they connect to the accounts to search for valuable
information to monetize. Some criminals also use compro-
mised accounts to send spam messages [26]. In this paper,
we focus on attackers that target social accounts and misuse
them in various ways, for instance, by sending unsolicited
messages to contacts of the victim or stockpiling stolen social
credentials for sale. The attackers under study have similar
privileges (within the stolen accounts) to owners of the ac-
counts, since those attackers have knowledge of the access
credentials that owners possess. Attackers also have the abil-
ity to extend the reach of their malicious activity to other
entities (i.e., accounts) connected to the victim’s social graph,
for instance, by abusing inherent trust and sending malicious
payloads to them.

3 Methods
We created 1008 Facebook test accounts in total, compris-
ing equal numbers of female adult, male adult, female teen,
and male teen accounts. In this section, we describe how we
created, instrumented, and deployed them.
3.1 Setting Up Honey Accounts
The process of populating the test accounts with data spanned
about 6 months, from November 7, 2017 until May 16, 2018.
We discuss those speciﬁc steps next.
Demographic Factors. Lévesque et al. [38] examined gen-
der and age, among other demographic factors, as risk factors
in malware infections. Inspired by their approach, we de-
signed personas around two demographic attributes, namely
age range (teen/adult) and gender (male/female). We wanted
to observe differences or similarities in the behavior of crim-
inals to the honey accounts, depending on the demographic
attributes of the accounts.
Proﬁle Names and Passwords. We assigned ﬁrst and last
names to the proﬁles by generating random combinations of
