### Abstract
Online social network (OSN) accounts are more user-centric than other types of online accounts, such as email, due to the presence of demographic attributes like age, gender, location, and occupation. While these attributes enhance meaningful online interactions, they can also be exploited by malicious actors for various forms of abuse. To investigate the impact of demographic attributes on attacker behavior in stolen OSN accounts, we developed a method to instrument and monitor such accounts. We created, instrumented, and deployed over 1,000 Facebook accounts, exposing them to potential criminals. Our findings confirm that the demographic traits of victims significantly influence the actions of cybercriminals. For example, attackers who access teen accounts tend to write more messages and posts compared to those accessing adult accounts. Additionally, attackers compromising male accounts are more likely to engage in disruptive activities, such as altering profile information, compared to those accessing female accounts. This knowledge can help online services develop new models to characterize benign and malicious activity across different demographic groups, enabling the automatic classification of future activity.

### 1. Introduction
Social media accounts have become indispensable in our daily lives, facilitating activities such as connecting with friends, consuming news, and securing job opportunities. Unlike webmail and instant messaging accounts, social media accounts provide extensive personal information, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals.

In this paper, we aim to understand the behavior of cybercriminals after they acquire credentials to social media accounts through illicit means. Specifically, we focus on how the demographic attributes of stolen accounts influence the activities of the criminals who access them. To achieve this, we created, deployed, and monitored 1,008 realistic decoy Facebook accounts. These accounts were designed with various age and gender configurations. To attract criminals, we leaked the credentials of a subset of these accounts on both the Surface Web and Dark Web, mimicking the methods used by cybercriminals to distribute stolen account credentials. We monitored the accounts for six months, extracted comprehensive activity records, and analyzed the data offline.

Our research questions include:
- How can we characterize the behavior of criminals in stolen accounts?
- Do differences in account demographics (age and gender) affect the activity of criminals in compromised social accounts?
- How long do criminals stay in social accounts after logging in?
- What type of content do they search for and post?

During our experiments, we observed 322 unique accesses to 284 accounts. Our results show that the age and gender of an account owner influence the types of actions criminals perform. For instance, attackers tend to search friend lists and initiate chats more frequently with teen accounts compared to adult ones. They also perform more disruptive activities, such as editing profiles, when interacting with male accounts, which was not observed for female accounts. These findings suggest that profile attributes play a significant role in the actions taken by attackers, opening up new research directions for better understanding and mitigating account hijacking.

**Key Lesson:** The age and gender of victims influence the behavior of cybercriminals when they access stolen Facebook accounts. This aligns with existing literature, which highlights the significance of age and gender in cybercrime and online abuse. Therefore, mitigation systems should be customized for different demographic groups, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to more adaptive defense systems.

**Contributions:**
1. We present a system to deploy and monitor honeypot accounts on Facebook, which can be adapted to other social networks.
2. We instrumented over 1,000 Facebook accounts and collected 322 unique accesses over six months.
3. We analyzed how different demographic traits influence the way attackers interact with compromised Facebook accounts.
4. We contextualize our results within existing research and discuss the need for tailored mitigation systems based on user demographics.

### 2. Background
#### 2.1 Motivation
Previous research has explored various factors influencing cybercrime victimization, including age, gender, and personality. For example, Henson et al. [29] found that male and female users utilize OSNs differently, particularly in terms of content uploaded, flirting behavior, and time spent on the platforms. Lévesque et al. [37] demonstrated that age and gender influence the likelihood of malware victimization, with men being at higher risk. Multiple studies show that women are disproportionately targeted by sexual harassment and stalking online, and younger people are more likely to experience online harassment [51].

Age also plays a significant role in victimization. Näsi et al. [40] reported that younger people are more likely to be victims, while Oliveira et al. [41] found that older women are more susceptible to phishing attacks. Conversely, Sheng et al. [45] showed that younger individuals (18 to 25 years old) are more likely to fall for phishing scams.

Personality traits, such as conscientiousness and emotional stability, also influence cybercrime victimization [54]. Egelman and Peer [24] emphasized the need for individualized interventions to improve security and privacy controls. Given the significant role of age, gender, and personality in online victimization, it is logical to expect that the behavior of a criminal upon breaching a specific online account would depend on these attributes. Our study focuses on how the demographic attributes of a victim account influence the behavior of criminals, which, to our knowledge, is a novel approach in the context of Facebook accounts.

#### 2.2 Related Work
**Account Takeover:**
Cybercriminals gain access to online accounts through various means, including information-stealing malware, data breaches, and manual account hijacking [15, 47, 27, 55, 18]. Redmiles [43] studied how people respond to attacks on their Facebook accounts, while Thomas et al. [52] examined suspended Twitter accounts to characterize spam techniques. Extensive work has been done on social spam and fake accounts [16, 35, 53, 56, 57, 61], and on developing systems to detect compromised accounts [23, 49]. Our focus, however, is on understanding how demographic attributes influence the behavior of criminals in compromised accounts.

**Honeypots:**
DeBlasio et al. [20] used honey webmail accounts to study compromised websites, while Han et al. [28] deployed sandboxed phishing kits to observe interactions. Other studies have used honeypot approaches to study the behavior of criminals in compromised webmail and cloud document accounts [18, 34, 42]. Kedrowitsch et al. [32] improved Linux sandboxes for evasive malware analysis, and Cao et al. [19] deployed network honeypots to detect SSH attacks. Barron and Nikiforakis [14] observed how system properties influenced attacker behavior. Our study, however, focuses on compromised social network accounts rather than machines.

#### 2.3 Facebook Accounts
A Facebook user creates an account and profile, sends friend requests, posts updates, and uses Messenger for private communication. Users can also like and react to content, and businesses and groups can maintain a presence through pages and groups. These features highlight the social nature of Facebook.

#### 2.4 Test Accounts
Facebook provides sandboxed test accounts, which are isolated from the main social graph but can connect to other test accounts. These accounts are suitable for testing, including security vulnerability testing [6]. The isolation ensures that real users are not harmed during experiments, meeting ethical requirements. Test accounts look similar to real accounts but have limitations, such as the inability to interact with regular accounts or authenticate on other Facebook-affiliated platforms. Despite these limitations, test accounts provide a realistic environment for our research.

#### 2.5 Download Your Information (DYI)
Facebook's "Download Your Information" (DYI) tool allows users to download a compressed archive of their account data and activity. The DYI archive includes login times, IP addresses, user-agent strings, messages, group chats, timeline posts, profile edits, and photo uploads. Although it does not cover all observable phenomena, it provides a rich source of information for our experiments. We use the DYI functionality to retrieve activity data from test accounts.

#### 2.6 Threat Model
Attackers compromise online accounts through phishing, malware, network attacks, and database breaches [21, 47, 49]. They then use the accounts to search for valuable information, send spam, or stockpile credentials for sale. In this paper, we focus on attackers who misuse social accounts, such as sending unsolicited messages or abusing trust. These attackers have similar privileges to the account owners and can extend their malicious activities to other connected entities.

### 3. Methods
We created 1,008 Facebook test accounts, equally divided among female adults, male adults, female teens, and male teens. This section describes the process of creating, instrumenting, and deploying these accounts.

#### 3.1 Setting Up Honey Accounts
The process of populating the test accounts with data took about six months, from November 7, 2017, to May 16, 2018. We designed personas around two demographic attributes: age range (teen/adult) and gender (male/female). We assigned first and last names to the profiles using random combinations.
