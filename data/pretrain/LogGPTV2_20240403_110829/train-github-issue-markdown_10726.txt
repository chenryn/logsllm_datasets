It appears that the `go get` command is experiencing issues when used with SSH-based Git repositories. Here's a detailed description of the problem and the environment in which it was observed:

### Issue Description
When attempting to use `go get` with SSH-based Git repositories, the following error occurs:
```
$ go get -v -f -u -insecure ./...
package github.com/marcopeereboom/gck: unable to parse output of git config remote.origin.url
package github.com/marcopeereboom/gck/ast: unable to parse output of git config remote.origin.url
...
```

This issue also arises for SSH-based Git repositories with an explicitly defined origin, such as:
```
ssh://my.server.com/git/myrepo.git
```

However, HTTPS-based repositories continue to function correctly.

### Example Output
To illustrate the problem, consider the following commands and their outputs:

1. **`go get` Command:**
   ```sh
   $ go get -v -f -u -insecure ./...
   package github.com/marcopeereboom/gck: unable to parse output of git config remote.origin.url
   package github.com/marcopeereboom/gck/ast: unable to parse output of git config remote.origin.url
   ...
   ```

2. **`git config remote.origin.url` Command:**
   ```sh
   $ git config remote.origin.url
   PI:EMAIL:marcopeereboom/gck.git
   ```

3. **Explicit SSH Origin:**
   The issue also occurs with repositories using an explicit SSH origin, such as:
   ```sh
   ssh://my.server.com/git/myrepo.git
   ```

### Environment Details
- **Go Version:**
  ```sh
  $ go version
  go version devel +60b7d27 Tue Jul 14 06:21:57 2015 +0000 darwin/amd64
  ```

- **Git Version:**
  ```sh
  $ git version
  git version 2.3.8 (Apple Git-58)
  ```

- **Operating System:**
  This issue has been observed on both macOS (Darwin) and OpenBSD.

### Summary
The `go get` command is failing to parse the `remote.origin.url` for SSH-based Git repositories, leading to errors. This issue does not affect HTTPS-based repositories. The problem has been confirmed on both macOS and OpenBSD.
