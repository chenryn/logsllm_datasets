User: Some Linux commands provide a single option that is equivalent to a given group of options, for convenience. For example, rsync has an option -a which is equivalent to -rlptgoD. For a Python script, is it possible to implement this behaviour using argparse? Or should I just pass the -a option to my code and handle it there?
Assistant: rsync has been around long enough that it (or many implementations) probably uses getopt for parsing the commands (if it doesn't do its own parsing).  Python has a version of getopt.  Neither the c version or the python has a mechanism for replacing a -a command with -rlptgoD.  Any such replacement is performed after parsing.
The primary purpose of a parser is to decode what the user wants.  Acting on that information is the responsibility of your code.  
I can imagine writing a custom Action class that would set multiple attributes at once.  But it wouldn't save any coding work.  It would look a lot like a equivalent function that is used after parsing.
