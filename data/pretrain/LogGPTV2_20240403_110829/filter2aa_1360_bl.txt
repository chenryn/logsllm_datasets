### Social Networks: Instagram
#### Chapter 12: Social Networks: Instagram
Instagram is a photo-sharing service owned by Facebook with over 1 billion active monthly users. It is popular among photo-sharing Twitter users and should not be ignored in social media investigations. For downloading an entire Instagram profile, Python tools like Instalooter and Instaloader are recommended.

**Basic Searches on Instagram:**
- **Username Search**: Instagram's search field only identifies users and hashtags, not providing a true keyword search.
- **Custom Google Search**: Using Google for keyword searches can yield more comprehensive results. For example, searching for "OSINT" on Google produces 963 results related to Instagram posts.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Viewing Page Source**: Right-click on the profile and select "View Page Source" to access the HTML code. Search for "og:image" to find high-resolution images.
- **High-Resolution Images**: Replace "\u0026" with "&" in the image URL to get higher resolution images.
- **User ID and Timestamps**: Use the user ID (e.g., 340416780) to query the Instagram API for detailed information, including timestamps of posts.

**Documenting Followers and Following:**
- **Manual Method**: Log in to your account, navigate to the target profile, and click on "Followers" or "Following". Use "Ctrl" + "A" or "command" + "A" to highlight the list and copy the links. Paste them into Excel or a similar tool.
- **API Query**: Use the following URL to get the first 50 people a user is following:
  ```
  https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query/?query_hash=d04b0a864b4b54837c0d870b0e77e076&variables={"id":"340416780","include_reel":true,"fetch_mutual":false,"first":50}
  ```

**Hashtags:**
- **Hashtag Search**: Use direct URLs to view all posts tagged with a specific hashtag. For example, `https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/osint/`.
- **Keyword vs. Hashtag**: Focus on keyword searches rather than hashtags, as many posts may not be properly tagged.

**Likes and Comments:**
- **Post Analysis**: Analyze likes and comments for additional context. For instance, a post with a Unix timestamp of 1543045570 translates to 11/24/2018 @ 2:27pm (UTC).

By using these techniques, you can gather more detailed and valuable data from Instagram for your investigations.
