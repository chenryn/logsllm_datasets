This same term searched on an Instagram page only displayed users that have the term within the username. 
When searching "#OSINT" on Instagram, I was provided a list of hashtags that include the keyword. Each of 
these hashtags are associated with multiple Instagram posts. Consider the following example in order to identify 
the benefits of searching away from the Instagram website. While on an Instagram page, 1 searched for my target 
"Darren Kitchen" from Hak5. This presented several profiles associated with people having that name, but none 
of them were my target. Instead, I went to Google and conducted the following search.
In previous editions of this book, I detailed several third-party Instagram search options that unlocked a lot of 
hidden content within user accounts. On June 1, 2016, Instagram tightened their API, and this killed most of 
the useful websites. My own Instagram tools page suffered drastically from the new restrictions in 2018 and 
2020, and 1 had to start over with new options. Fortunately, you still have many search options for your next 
Instagram investigation. Let's start with keyword searching. 1 have found greater success with a custom Google 
search instead of an Instagram search field. The following query on Google will produce 963 results that displa’ 
Instagram posts that mention "OSINT" within the post tide or comments.
While Facebook and Twitter are likely going to offer the most bang for your buck in terms of web-based social 
network presence, Instagram has captured a large share of the market over the past two years. Instagram is a 
photo-sharing service that is now owned by Facebook. With well over 1 billion active monthly users, the amount 
of content available here is overwhelming. This application works alone or in correlation with Facebook and 
Twitter to distribute the photos. This sendee is very popular with most photo sharing Twitter users and should 
not be ignored. My preferred method of downloading a person's entire Instagram profile is through the Python 
tools Instalooter and Instaloader, as previously explained in the Linux, Mac and Windows chapters. These 
utilities will download all the images from a profile, but there is much more data out there which may be valuable 
to your investigations. You will need to be logged in to an Instagram account for most techniques in this chapter. 
First, let's start with some basics.
These are the various pages and posts that contain the text of my target's username. Many of these are posts 
from the target, which we have already seen by looking at his profile. A few are from associates of the target
Surprisingly, there is no search feature on the Instagram home page. If you want to search Instagram, you must 
connect directly to an account such as Instagram.com/mikeb. However, this search field only identifies users 
and hashtags related to the search terms. It does not provide a true keyword search. We will use search engines 
for this in a moment.
The first result was my target's profile (@hak5darren). Similar to Facebook and Twitter, a person's Instagram 
profile only tells a small portion of the story. Conducting the following search on Google revealed 215 results.
This produced one result, but it was not connected to my target. Since people seldomly use last names on 
Instagram, I modified my search to the following.
site:instagram.com "@hak5darren"
site:instagram.com "@hak5darren"
site:instagram.com "hak5darren"

Similar to the previous search, it forces Google to ignore the target's profile, and only focus on people that are

Copying this URL into your browser likely presents "Bad URL timestamp". This is because Instagram wants to 
make it difficult to obtain images with higher resolution. Fortunately, some minor modification of the URL 
returns the feature. If we simply replace every instant of "\u0026" within the URL with 
it loads fine. This
example would be the following.

This URL presents a profile image which is now twice as large as the original image provided within the profile. 
This is not the full-size image, but it possesses a higher resolution. Fortunately, we can do much better in regard 
to the images from his posts. When clicking on the first image on his profile, we are given a new URL of 
https://www.instagram.eom/p/CGVRO3uglqB/ which displays the image and comments. The image is highl}’ 
compressed. Clicking on the image does nothing, and right-clicking gives us no options associated with photos. 
Instead, right-click on this post image and select "View Page Source" again. This opens a new' tab similar to the 
following.
This image has much higher resolution, and is our best option for viewing and archiving. Once you load this 
URL in the browser, you can right-click on the image and easily save it. Does this seem like too much trouble 
for ever}’ image of interest on Instagram? No argument here. If you prefer to allow’ a third-part}’ service to 
replicate this for you, the following sites will download the best quality image available within a post. Regardless 
of your method, you should understand the functions allowing for the capture of these high-resolution images.

Notice the section of "si 50x150". This tells Instagram to only display a 150-pixel square icon of the target. This 
is a highly compressed thumbnail image. In previous years, we could remove that section and display the full- 
sized image, but that no longer functions. Instead, we can only enlarge the profile image slightly. In the previous 
URL notice the number directly before ".jpg". The last set of numbers is "1916767107". Back in the page of 
source code for the profile, conduct a search for these numbers. You should receive three results, the third is a 
URL similar to the following.

The text-only result should display pages of details, but I find the following of most interest.
"pk": 340416780, 
"username”: "hak5darren", 
"full_name": "Darren", 
"is_private": false, 
"media_count": 949,

"has_highlight_reels": true, 
"has_guides": false, 
"can_be_reported_as_fraud": false, 
"is_business": false,
You should also consider digging into the source code of your evidence in order to identify further details that 
could be valuable. First, I like to identify the user number of an account. Similar to Facebook and Twitter, people 
can change their username on Instagram, but not their user number. Right-click on your target profile page and 
select the option to view the source code. This will open a new tab with a lot of pure text. Using either "Ctrl" + 
"F" or "command" + "F", conduct a search for exactly the following. The numbers directly after this data will 
be the user number of your target. In our previous example, his user number is 340416780.
Viewing the source code of this page, search for "taken_at_timestamp". This produces a Unix timestamp of 
1549225611". Converting this from Unix to standard time on the website located at epochconverter.com
reveals the image was uploaded on Sunday, February 3, 2019 at 8:26:51 PM in universal time (GMT) format
Your target may change their username, but they cannot change their user ID. If you know that your target's 
user ID is 340416780, but you can no longer access their profile based on the username, we can query the 
Instagram API to get the new details. However, you must first spoof your user-agent. In Chapter Two, I 
explained the Firefox extension called User-Agent Switcher and Manager. Open this menu within your Firefox 
browser; change the second drop-down menu to "Android"; change the first drop-down menu to "Instagram"; 
select the first option; click "Apply" (container on window); and navigate to the following page.
I realize these details are very minor. However, documenting this content can announce the difference between 
an average OSINT investigator and an expert. If you plan to serve any legal process later, knowing the user 
number and exact time of activity will be crucial.
If the target had changed his username, we would see it here. While inconvenient, this is the most stable way to 
translate a user ID back into a username. While we are looking at the source code of pages, we can use this 
technique to identify the exact time that a post was published. Instagram only identifies the date of a post, and 
not the time. This detail can be crucial to a legal investigation. For this example, I located an image posted by 
our target at the following address.

After logging in to your account and navigating to the target profile, you will be able to simply click on 
"Followers'* or "Following". In this demonstration, I chose the people he is "following", often referred to as 
friends. This opened a new window on my screen with the first twenty people displayed. Since hakodarren 
follows 215 people, 1 can scroll down the entire list to load all of the accounts. You will not be able to see all of 
the accounts at once because the window only displays ten within its boundaries. This causes screen capture 
tools to be useless in this scenario. If you are using either the Firefox browser we created within Linux or your 
own version of Firefox with the recommended add-ons, you can easily copy this list. After scrolling down to 
load all of the users, press either "Ctrl" + "A" (Windows & Linux) or "command" + "A" (Mac) on your keyboard. 
This will highlight or "select" the enure list. Next, right-click within this window and choose "Copy selected 
links". This copies all of the Instagram account hyperlinks within the target's following list into your computer 
clipboard. Open your desired documentation software, such as Word, Excel, or any text editor, and paste the 
contents into the application. 1 prefer Excel (or Calc within the free LibreOffice suite) for this task. Pasting the 
results confirmed 199 accounts, four of which are shown in Figure 12.03. Repeat the process with "Followers".
Instagram now requires users to be logged in to an account in order to view the followers of a target or the 
profiles that a target follows (friends). Viewing these lists is not a challenge, but proper documentation can be 
tricky. The following explains how 1 choose to view and document every Instagram follower and friend of my 
target account, using hakodarren as an example.
In my experience, Instagram limits the number of accounts within this window to 1,000. This should be 
sufficient for most friends of the target, but may be limited when looking at the followers of famous people. 
While Instagram offers a text-only view of followers and following, it appears limited to 50 random profiles. 1 
included these long links within the search tools, but I do not rely on them. 1 prefer this manual method. If your 
target's user ID was 340416780, the following URL presents the first 50 people he is following.
I do not pay much attention to hashtags within my investigations. I prefer to focus more on search terms. Many 
people do not properly tag a post, and you can miss a lot by limiting your search to a hashtag. If I search for 
hashtags of #shooting, I may see valuable data. If a potential target only posts the term "shooting" without the
I would miss the post. This is why I rely much more heavily on searching within Google, as explained 
momentarily.
A hashtag is a word or phrase preceded by a hash sign (#) used on social media websites and applications, 
especially Twitter and Instagram, in order to identify messages on a specific topic. If 1 wanted to view all posts 
tagged with "osint", the following direct URL would be appropriate.

1543045570 is a Unix timestamp as we saw before within Instagram source code. This is a way to track time as 
a running total of seconds. This count starts at the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC. Therefore, the 
Unix timestamp is the number of seconds between a particular date and the Unix Epoch. In our example, 
1543045570 represents 11/24/2018 @ 2:27pm (UTC). I used unixtimestamp.com for this translation.
