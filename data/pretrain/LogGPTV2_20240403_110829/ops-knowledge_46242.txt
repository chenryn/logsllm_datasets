User: I have installed python 2.6.6 and python 2.5.5 on the same machines (Ubuntu 10.0.4), since 2.6 is my default version and 2.5 I need for maintaining old stuff.
But I have a problem to install modules(MySQLdb and net-snmp) to non-default 2.5v. It seems that only 2.6 is updated when 'sudo apt-get install _module_name_' is called. 
Is there a way to tell for which version module should be installed?
Thanks in advance
Assistant: You can use easy_install. To use it for particular version, you just execute it like for example sudo python2.5 easy_install package_name.
