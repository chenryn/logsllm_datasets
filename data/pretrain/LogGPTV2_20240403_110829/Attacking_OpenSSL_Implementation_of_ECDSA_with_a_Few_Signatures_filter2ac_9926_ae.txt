MSD of the ephemeral key k and the sign of kl−1.
Assuming for some ephemeral key k, we have kl = 1 and
Next we will show how we will use the results of Proposi-
tion 1 and Proposition 2 to improve the lattice attack. We
only take the case of LAD = L0 as an example, the case of
LAD > L0 can be dealt with similarly so we will omit for
simplicity.

1 6 kl−1 6 2w − 1. Then we have k =
j=1 kj · 2(cid:21)j =
j=1 kj · 2(cid:21)j . Let kj = 2(dj − 2w−1) + 1,
2(cid:21)l + kl−1 · 2(cid:21)l−1 +
l−2

where 0 6 kl−1  2L0−1 and (2kl − 1)2LAD−2  2L0−LAD and kl <
2L0−LAD+1 since kl is an odd. This (cid:12)nishes the proof.
From Proposition 3, if LAD < L0, the number of all the
possible cases of the MSD is 2L0−LAD−1, which is no greater
than 2w−2 since L0 − LAD 6 w − 1. So we can enumerate
all the possible values of MSD if the number of signatures
are small.
If L0 − LAD = 1, we can determine
kl = 3; if L0 − LAD = 2, the only possible values of MSD
are kl = 5, 7. According to our statistical results on the
secp256k1 curve, about 45% among all the cases of LAD <
Suppose w = 3.
1513L0 satis(cid:12)es that L0 − LAD = 1, while the remaining satis(cid:12)es
L0 − LAD = 2. The average time of using the enumeration
method is prolonged by 20:403×0:55u ≈ 1.167u times, where
u is the number of signatures used to recover the secret key.
If u = 4, 5 and 6, the time of using enumeration is separately
prolonged by about 1.849, 2.156 and 2.514 times.
As we can see that, the use of enumeration can decrease
the number of non-zero digits of k, thus reducing the di-
mension of the corresponding lattice with just a little cost
of time.
5. EXPERIMENT RESULTS
We applied our attack to the secp256k1 curve, whose
window size is w = 3. All executions were performed on
an Intel Core i7-3770 CPU running at 3.40GHz in single
thread. We use the BKZ algorithms with blocksize 20 and
25 implemented in the NTL library to solve the SVP in-
stances. All of our codes are written in C++. As stated
above, our attack is applied on the basic assumption that a
perfect double-and-add chain of the ephemeral key k can be
obtained. As the success probability of the original method
in Section 3.2 is too low, we only give the experiment re-
sults using the improved methods. Given the number of
signatures u = 4, 5, 6, 7, various combinations of improved
attack methods, and di(cid:11)erent lattice reduction algorithms,
we execute 200 experiments each time to recover the secret
key, with the success probability computed by the ratio of
the number of success attacks and 200. We list the results
of attacks in Table 3. As we can see, only 4 signatures are
enough to recover the secret key, while using 5 signatures
we can succeed with probability of 37.5%, using 6 signa-
tures with probability of 90% and using 7 signatures with
probability of 94%.
According to [26],
it is quite easy to identify 581 full
double-and-add chain among 1000 random Flush+Reload
attack results, containing only 4 error chains. So it is pos-
sible to get a perfect double-and-add chain with probability
being about 57.7%. As we can succeed recovering the secret
key with 4, 5, 6 and 7 signatures with perfect double-and-
add chain, the actual number of signatures we need is about
7, 9, 11 and 13. Note that the success probability using 4
signatures is not high enough, we believe that if our attack
use other powerful reduction algorithm, like the BKZ 2.0
algorithm [6], the success probability will be increased.
Our attack can be applied to other curves implemented
by wNAF method like the secp521r1 curve, and can also
be extended to any cryptographic implementation using the
wNAF representation, like DSA, SM2, etc.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we demonstrated that ECDSA implemented
by OpenSSL using the wNAF representation can be broken
using the lattice attack with the help of the Flush+Reload
attack. We develop a new e(cid:14)cient method of extracting and
utilizing side-channel information to mount a lattice attack
to ECDSA. After that, the methods of elimination, merging,
MSD recovering and enumeration are used to remarkably
increase the success probability of key recovery. Our attack
is mounted to the secp256k1 curve in experiments. It is
shown that given results of perfect Flush+Reload attack,
4 signatures would be enough to recover the secret key.
