This is not really bugging me, but just would like to know if there is
anything wrong with the code (I am on Ubuntu 18.04 if that helps).
#### Reproducing code example (`test.py`):
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.interpolate import LSQBivariateSpline
    # generate data
    x, y = np.meshgrid(
        np.linspace(0, 10, 30),
        np.linspace(0, 5, 40)
    )
    x = x.flatten()
    y = y.flatten()
    z = np.exp(-(x-5)**2/4) + np.exp(-(y-2)**2/3)
    # define the knot positions
    tx = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
    ty = [0.2, 0.8, 1.1, 1.8, 2.5, 3, 3.7, 4.2, 4.9]
    # get spline fit
    s = LSQBivariateSpline(x, y, z, tx, ty, kx=3, ky=3)
    # new evaluation
    x2, y2 = np.meshgrid(
        np.linspace(0, 10, 50),
        np.linspace(0, 5, 60)
    )
    z_new = s(x2, y2, grid=False)
#### Error message:
Run code in terminal as `python -i test.py`, with the following error bumps
out before quitting Python terminal:
    python -i tmp.py 
    >>> 
    corrupted size vs. prev_size
    Aborted (core dumped)
or
    python tmp.py 
    Segmentation fault (core dumped)
This error message shows up randomly, roughly 1 out of 5 trials will trigger
the error.
