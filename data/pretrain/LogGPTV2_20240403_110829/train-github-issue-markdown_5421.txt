# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

When the user presses `Shift + Insert`, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) should paste the content from the clipboard into the command line.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

To implement this feature, we can modify the WSL input handling to recognize the `Shift + Insert` key combination. When this key combination is detected, the system should retrieve the current clipboard content and insert it into the command line at the cursor position. This can be achieved by integrating with the Windows Clipboard API to access and paste the clipboard content. Additionally, we need to ensure that this behavior is consistent across different terminal emulators and WSL distributions.
