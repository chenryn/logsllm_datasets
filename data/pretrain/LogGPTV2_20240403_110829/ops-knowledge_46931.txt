User: Designing an online video platform based on microservice architecture requires high concurrency and high availability.
Assistant: The following is the design of an online video platform based on microservice architecture: 1. Authentication and authorization microservices: used for user authentication and authorization processing, including user registration, login, password modification, password retrieval, basic user information query, role Rights management and other functions. 2. Video storage and management microservice: used to process video upload, storage, and management, including functions such as video upload interface, video management interface, video viewing interface, and video deletion interface. 3. Search micro-service: used to process user search video requests, including keyword search, category search and other functions. 4. Playback microservices: used to process user requests for playing videos, including video transcoding, video fragmentation, video playback, barrage functions, etc. 5. Comment microservice: used to process user comments, likes, forwarding and other operations on videos, including comment posting interface, comment query interface, comment like interface, comment forwarding interface and other functions. 6. Recommendation micro-service: Recommend relevant videos based on user historical behavior and information, including manual recommendation and algorithm recommendation. 7. Order micro-service: used to process user's order payment, order query, order refund and other functions. 8. Advertising microservice: used to manage and display various advertisements during video playback, including carousel advertisements, interstitial advertisements, and floating advertisements. 9. Monitoring and log microservices: used to monitor and record the operating status and abnormal conditions of the entire system, and perform log management. 10. Gateway service: It is used to integrate the unified interface provided by all microservices to the outside, while providing functions such as security authentication, flow control and load balancing. Optimization aspects: 1. Adopt distributed storage and cache technology to improve the efficiency and reliability of the system. 2. Use CDN technology to accelerate video transmission and playback. 3. Use technologies such as distributed message queues to improve the concurrency and scalability of the system. 4. Monitor system running status in real time, and adjust and optimize system architecture in time. High concurrency and high availability requirements can be achieved through the above design and optimization measures.
