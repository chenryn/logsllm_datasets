parties, and even democracy. The high proﬁle attacks of 2016
were a catalyst, raising questions about the digital security
responsibilities of campaigns. What we likely observed in
our study is a population in the midst of a shift. We don’t yet
know the scope of the changes that campaigns will implement
over the next decade. Time will reveal how their work culture
evolves, what security norms become commonplace, and what
tools and processes they adapt from security best practices
(e.g., risk assessments, auditing, automated threat scanning,
managed hardware, zero-trust environments, or hiring dedi-
cated security professionals). Behavior change is difﬁcult and
often takes time. We believe that changing the direction of
campaign security culture will require the help of a diverse
group of experts, including from political committees and
organizations, technology companies, and academia.
In this section, we offer ideas to help guide the shift toward
prioritizing security. In particular, we propose three near-
term areas of investment for those who support campaigns:
(1) establishing effective, consistent security guidance; (2)
improving the usability of account security; and (3) improving
the affordability of security protections. We also suggest long-
term areas for future research. See Table 2 for a summary of
our ﬁndings and recommendations.
5.1 Education & consistent guidance
Most users do not prioritize security [44, 93], and that often
seems to apply to campaign workers as well. We believe that
security training for people involved with campaigns will be
an important part of a work culture shift towards prioritizing
security, and many of the experts involved in our roundtable
agreed [25].
Some participants described efforts by various party com-
mittees and organizations that are already underway to train
campaign staff, consultants, and party committee members
on security. For example, the DDC ramped up educational
efforts across many federal campaigns in the 2020 election
cycle and gave free hardware security keys to staff on over
140 campaigns. However, these efforts are relatively new,
and they often reference guides (such as the D3P Cybersecu-
rity Campaign Playbook [10], Device and Account Security
Checklist 2.0 [56], and others) that, while offering good secu-
rity advice, differ in the order of which security actions they
ask campaigns to prioritize. This echoes prior work on secu-
rity advice for general Internet users, which shows that the
security expert community lacks consensus [73]. Inconsistent
advice—even when the inconsistencies seem small to security
experts—can cause confusion and inaction. Similar to Her-
ley’s recommendation to clearly prioritize security advice for
users [44], it would be helpful if the people and organizations
that campaigns trust (political inﬂuencers, political commit-
tees, technology providers, policy makers, etc.) recommend
the same top-priority security protections for campaigns to
employ. People on campaigns would also beneﬁt from consis-
tent technical language when guidance from various sources
refers to technical concepts and features.
Education and training efforts will be a key component of
improving the security of campaigns going forward, though
alone are not a panacea. To be successful, people should be
trained as early as possible in their work with any campaign.
Security guidance needs to be championed by the people who
inﬂuence campaign work culture. Experts in our roundtable
emphasized that this would typically include the campaign
manager, senior staff, and certain consultants [25]. These are
important people to train ﬁrst. The candidate was not typically
described as the “right” person to set security priorities, since
they tend to focus on public appearances and fundraising, but
many thought that candidates could be inﬂuential in commu-
nicating priorities for the campaign. We acknowledge that
even with more consistent guidance, educational efforts will
still be limited by the pace, resources, attention, and priorities
of campaign workers.
5.2 Usable account security
While campaigns face a multitude of vulnerabilities and po-
tential threats, we argue that solutions should prioritize the
ability and willingness of people involved with campaigns to
successfully use strong account security protections.
2FA. Usability issues with 2FA are known for creating
adoption challenges, even in cases where the motivation to
employ it appears to be high (e.g., for banking [39, 50]). Sim-
ilarly, our results show that 2FA adoption continued to lag
among campaign workers, and even when present, weaker
options like SMS codes were among the most popular. Many
participants had a poor understanding of 2FA, the protections
offered by different second factors, and the importance of
using 2FA on most accounts. We also learned that people
involved with campaigns used many accounts and providers,
but that the user experience of 2FA differed across providers.
To better support people involved with campaigns, tech-
nology providers could explore how 2FA usability across
different platforms can be improved—users are likely to be

Recommendations for Safer Campaigns
Overall
Campaign security—including changing work cultures to prioritize
security—must be a joint effort, involving technology companies, policy
makers, political organizations, academic institutions, and campaigns
Education
– All supporters should provide consistent guidance on top security
priorities for campaigns
– Train campaign workers as early as possible
– Include motivational content aimed to establish security culture on
campaigns
– Recruit inﬂuencers (e.g., campaign manager, senior staff, consultants)
to champion security
Technology
– Standardize 2FA across providers
– Reduce password manager errors and overhead
– Evaluate usability of security products with campaign workers in situ
– Improve multi-tenant account usability
Policy
– Ease ﬁnancial burden on campaigns for security costs
Research community
– More research on campaign security around the world, more types of
campaigns/roles

confused by differing terminology, requirements, second fac-
tor options, and locations of settings. Part of this includes
exploring if it is possible to offer consistency in what second
factors and other requirements providers support. And as part
of the educational efforts described above, this population
needs clear advice about what type of 2FA they should turn
on and for what accounts, as well as help to understand why
2FA is important to winning elections.
Password practices.
Passwords are the ﬁrst layer of de-
fense for accounts, and password managers can be an effective
way to help users manage strong, unique passwords and mini-
mize the chance that they will accidentally enter their authen-
tication credentials into a phishing site. For shared accounts,
password managers can help manage and secure strong cre-
dentials when multiple people need access. However, most
participants thought that password managers took signiﬁcant
enough overhead to set up and use that widespread adoption
by people involved with campaigns was very unlikely.
Technology providers can better support this population by
continuing to improve the integration and interoperability of
password managers, browsers, and apps. Password managers
could ensure users are explicitly warned when they attempt
to enter credentials on an unknown site or one that might be a
phishing site, with advice on how to tell if there is a problem.
Shared & transiently owned accounts.
Participants ob-
served that shared and transiently owned accounts tended to
have weak security protections. Technology providers can
help by improving multi-tenant account usability and making
it easier to audit and change account access and ownership.
5.3 Policy: Affordable technology & training
Campaigns need help with the cost of security technologies
and training. Regarding training, it is hard for campaigns to
invest in training staff when they will be on to their next job
in a year or less. Part of the return on investment with training
is in the longer careers of those individuals in campaigns
and politics, which is an expense that might be difﬁcult for
a budget-constrained campaign to justify. The typical staffer
will change jobs frequently, and consultants work across many
campaigns, so staffers and consultants who do receive security
training can bring the knowledge and practices with them
to the next campaign. Regarding security technologies, it
is hard to justify investments in infrastructure that will no

longer be used after election day. The decision to invest in
security technology and training is easier if such resources are
freely available. In many instances, campaign ﬁnance laws
and regulations prevent companies and organizations from
making contributions to campaigns, including providing free
security services or technologies (such as hardware security
keys or shared password manager accounts that cost money
for others), absent speciﬁc exemptions [92]. Policy makers
could consider ways to enable all campaigns to leverage free,
effective, easy-to-use security support, to protect themselves
and democracy.
5.4 Future research
We believe that more research would help a diverse group of
experts from political committees and organizations, technol-
ogy companies, and academia improve security for political
campaigns. They would beneﬁt from foundational research ex-
ploring campaign security around the world, and with an even
broader range of campaigns and campaign workers, including
down-ballot races, candidates’ family members, and more.
Technology providers could beneﬁt from usability studies
of speciﬁc protections (such as 2FA, password management,
shared accounts, and more), especially recruiting from this
population and observing product use in realistic contexts.
6 Conclusion
“Security and politics should be separate. If you’re a candi-
date, you should win or lose on your best day, based on who
you are. Not because your email got popped and posted on-
line by a . –A participant
Our study highlighted how ongoing security challenges
facing political campaigns stem from a combination of work
culture, technology practices, and underdeveloped threat mod-
els. Campaigns are transient organizations with tight budgets
and amorphous boundaries that are made up of busy people
with limited security knowledge. Participants described dig-
ital security as a relatively new need for campaigns—one
not often viewed as essential to winning elections—making
investments in security hard to justify.
People on campaigns presently rely on a variety of per-
sonal and work accounts across platforms and domains. Their
ad hoc adoption of 2FA, strong passwords, encryption, and
access controls introduced vulnerabilities that were not con-
sistently mitigated. Participants recognized a growing risk of
state-sponsored attacks (and phishing in particular), though
expressed that strong protections continue to lag in adoption.
No one company, organization, institution, or campaign
can solve the problems described in this paper on their own.
Protecting campaign accounts and data will be more success-
ful as a joint effort, involving a variety of perspectives and
collective action from technology companies, the policy com-
munity, committees and organizations that support campaigns,
academic institutions, and individual users who are involved
with campaigns. We provide an initial understanding of this
complex problem space that we hope will be used to help
work toward solutions that are effective for this population.
We suggest that, in the near-term, effective, consistent security
guidance should be prioritized to inform security education;
investigations should be performed on how to coordinate the
standardization of usable account security protections (includ-
ing 2FA, password managers, and multi-tenant accounts); and
the affordability and availability of security technologies and
training should be improved. In the longer-term, people work-
ing to support campaigns could explore how to shift the work
culture of campaigns to prioritize security. With such collec-
tive action, we in the security community can do our part
to improve digital security for campaigns, helping to protect
future elections and democracy.
