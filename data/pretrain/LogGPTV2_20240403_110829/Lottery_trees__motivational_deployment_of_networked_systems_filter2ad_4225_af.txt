Table 2: Sensitivity analysis—competitive ratios
table shows the worst competitive ratio achieved by our choices of
β and δ across the simulated range. With one exception, our choice
of β and δ achieves a competitive ratio of at least 0.7 for all para-
meter sweeps. The exception is STC as shown in Figure 4 (right);
the competitive ratio of our parameters starts dropping signiﬁcantly
as STC increases. In all other cases, our choices were robust to
changes in model settings.
Interestingly, this holds even as we
substituted entire model blocks (social network model, diffusion
model, etc...) by other models. For instance, our choices of β and
δ achieve a competitive ratio of more than 0.9 when replacing the
availability-based contribution model [15] by a uniform contribu-
tion model, or when replacing the independent cascade diffusion
model with a model that is based on real diffusion data reported for
the LiveJournal community in [6].
8. LEGAL ISSUES
This section2 applies only to laws of the United States; laws in
other countries may differ considerably.
There are three classes of law that have technical bearing on the
lottree mechanism as presented in this paper: promotion law, tax
law, and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.
Two aspects of promotion law impact lottree deployment. First,
depending on the effort required, the installation and running of
a distributed-system component may be judged to be “considera-
tion”, meaning that it is legally regarded as a transfer of tangible
value from the participant to the executive. If so, the executive is
obligated to provide an alternate means of entry (AMOE) by which
a person can become eligible for the payout without participating
2Although we address only those legal issues with direct technical impact,
it exceedingly important to respect all applicable laws when deploying a
lottree system. It is a misdemeanor to run any system in which some form
of value is distributed randomly, if not constructed in accordance with ap-
plicable laws.
in the system. This is the reason behind the “no purchase nec-
essary” disclaimers that typically accompany commercial sweep-
stakes. The potential impact on a lottree deployment is that some
small fraction of “participants” may not actually be contributing in
any way to the system. Second, promotion law generally disallows
variable prize pools, which precludes use of the rescaling technique
described in Section 5.3.
The main issue involving tax law is that any payment in excess
of the 1099 threshold requires the ﬁling of a 1099-MISC tax form.
This threshold is set for each tax year and is 600 dollars for tax
year 2007. The impact on lottree deployment is that a payment in
excess of 600 dollars may be more burdensome for both the system
executive and the lottree winner.
The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 was designed to legally inhibit
companies from sending unwanted commercial email. It also re-
stricts the degree to which a company can encourage others to send
commercial email on the company’s behalf. This law impacts lot-
tree deployments in two ways: First, the lottree must not encour-
age email solicitations in preference to other modes of solicitation.
Second, the lottree should limit the number of solicitations each
participant can issue per day; in our simulations, we limited this
number to three.
We believe that the Pachira scheme, which we plan to employ to
spur deployment of our own networked system, complies with all
the above laws.
9. RELATED WORK
There exists a vast literature on incentive mechanisms and tech-
niques in the networking literature. However, most prior schemes
are relevant only to symmetric systems in which every node has a
rational interest in participating or contributing. As pointed out in
the introduction, such mechanisms are unsuited to be employed as
a means for motivational deployment to bootstrap asymmetric sys-
tems or symmetric systems that require a sufﬁciently large network
effect to become self-sustained. Much of this work, for instance,
is tailored to speciﬁc peer-to-peer applications, including ﬁle shar-
ing [32], routing [8], content distribution [31], and multicast [27].
There has also been research into application-generic symmetric
incentives such as bartering [11], economic systems [36], tit-for-
tat [23] as in BitTorrent, or robustness in BAR models [22].
In
the context of asymmetric systems, CompuP2P [18] is a peer-to-
peer system that constructs decentralized markets for buying and
selling computing resources. CompuP2P assumes the availability
of a electronic payment mechanism to scalably and securely trans-
fer funds from the system’s beneﬁciaries to its contributors, in ex-
change for use of the contributors’ resources. Kamvar et al. [19]
consider a pay-per-transaction ﬁle-sharing system, wherein peers
are in competition for the opportunity to proﬁt by providing re-
quested ﬁle content. They show that such competition can lead to
non-cooperation, similar to a lottree without the WSI property.
10. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we addressed the question of how to motivate peo-
ple to join or contribute to a networked system that does not (or
not yet) offer them inherent participation beneﬁt. In answer, we
proposed a lottery tree, a mechanism that probabilistically rewards
each participant in a manner dependant on its contribution as well
as on the contributions of others whose participation it has solicited.
Lottrees are most effective at spurring deployment when systems
are small or medium-sized, which are the scales at which motiva-
tional deployment is most challenging. As the system scale in-
creases, the lottree’s effectiveness begins to wane, just as the self-
sustaining aspects of the networked system can be expected to be-
come active.
We formally deﬁned seven desirable properties for lottrees and
constructed the Pachira lottree scheme, which simultaneously sat-
isﬁes a maximal satisﬁable subset of these properties. We further
showed relatively straightforward work-arounds for the two prop-
erties that Pachira does not satisfy.
We then conducted extensive simulations, with which we derived
good choices for the Pachira lottree’s parameters, determined an
appropriate payout amount based on target deployment scale and
expected participation effort, and determined the required count of
initial participants to preclude stunted deployment. We also per-
formed a wide range of simulation experiments to analyze the sen-
sitivity of our evaluation to our modeling assumptions and hidden
parameters.
We conclude that Pachirais a practically ideal candidate for de-
ploying real networked systems, and we plan to employ this scheme
as part of an ongoing distributed-systems project requiring contri-
butions of CPU and bandwidth from a large number of PC users.
A looming open problem is auditing. The lottree mechanism is
inherently based on the assumption that each participant’s contribu-
tion can be reliably and securely measured and reported to the exec-
utive entity. Depending on the properties of the system in question,
this may be anywhere from thoroughly straightforward to exceed-
ingly challenging.
It may be interesting to consider generalized versions of lottree
systems, such as those not constrained to a tree structure. This
could be relevant, for example, in cases in which a potential partic-
ipant is concurrently solicited by more than one active member of
the system.
