  * TensorFlow version: 1.12.0
  * Python version: 3.6.7

**Describe the problem**
**Provide the exact sequence of commands / steps that you executed before
running into the problem**  
I have been working with some code in keras that works fine with the cpu
version of tensorflow (pip install tensorflow) Since each epoch was taking a
minute to run, I wanted to throw my 1070ti at the problem. I installed
tensorflow-gpu (pip install tensorflow-gpu) along with CUDA and CuDNN. I then
did a quick restart but when I went to run my code again it didn't make keras
use the gpu version of tensorflow. I uninstalled tensorflow (pip uninstall
tensorflow) gave it another restart and now getting the following error with
the DLL load failing. Reinstalling the cpu version of Tensorflow getting it
working again but only on the CPU. I can't see what I have done wrong but any
help is appreciated. I have a look through some of the past issues but the
solutions only seem to be for the CPU package not importing. Might have missed
some finesse there so please do point out the obvious.
