### The Schlage Primus
- **Design:** Based on a pin-tumbler lock with an additional independent locking mechanism.
- **Security:** Manipulation is possible but extremely difficult. Some experts can pick these in under a minute, but most cannot.
- **Focus:** This presentation will focus on key duplication and its implications.

### Modeling the Side Bitting
- **Design Requirements:**
  1. **Minimum Slope:** Finger pin must settle to the bottom of its valley.
  2. **Maximum Slope:** Key must go in and out smoothly.
  3. **Radiused Bottom:** Matches the radius of a finger pin.

### Key Cross-Section
- **Universal Shape:** One shape fits all Primus locks.
- **Physical Constraints:** Pins and control surfaces are always in the same relative position to the cylinder housing.

### 3D Modeling in OpenSCAD
- **Language:** OpenSCAD, a programming language that compiles to 3D models.
- **First Use:** Nirav Patel in 2011.
- **Implementation:** A full implementation of a Primus key is a few hundred lines of code.

```scad
// top_code is a list of 6 integers.
// side_code is a list of 5 integers.
// If control = true, a LFIC removal key will be created.
module key(top_code, side_code, control = false) {
    bow();
    difference() {
        envelope();
        bitting(top_code, control);
        sidebar(side_code);
    }
}
```

### Hand Machining
- **Materials:**
  - Hardware store key blank ($1)
  - Dremel-type rotary tool ($80)
  - Calipers ($20)
- **Process:** Cut, measure, and repeat.
- **Time:** Rob can produce a key in less than an hour.

### Computer-Controlled Milling
- **Factory Method:** Used by Schlage.
- **Cost:** High setup cost (hundreds of dollars), not practical for one-off jobs.
- **Future:** Keep an eye on low-cost precision micromills.

### 3D Printing
- **Technology:** Game-changing for key fabrication.
- **Materials:**
  - Low-resolution plastic
  - High-resolution plastic
  - Titanium

### 3D Printing Results
- **Working Keys:**
  - Standard plastic (Shapeways “White Strong and Flexible”): $1 to $5
  - High-resolution plastic (Shapeways “Frosted Ultra Detail”): $1 to $5
  - Titanium (i.materialise): $100
- **Performance:**
  - Plastic keys have some strength issues but are workable.
  - Titanium keys outperform genuine Schlage keys.
- **Resolution:** Sufficient for all processes.
- **Future:** Expect prices to decrease over the next few years.

### Results
- **Key Decoding:** Easy with high-resolution photos and known dimensions.
- **Key Duplication:** Inexpensive and straightforward with this presentation's content.
- **Master Key Extrapolation:** Similar to cracking a standard pin-tumbler system.
- **Keyless Manipulation:** Still challenging; requires a photo of a key or disassembling a lock.

**Recommendations:**
- **Primus Usage:** Not suitable for high-security applications.
- **Existing Installations:** Reevaluate security needs.

### Implications
- **Security Transformation:** Physical security is now translated into information security.
- **Patent Protection:** Defends against physical reproduction but not electronic distribution of 3D models.
- **Power Shift:** Unskilled attackers gain significant power once a class of keys is 3D modeled.

### Future Work
- **Integrated Process:** Combine 3D modeling software with image-to-key decoding and 3D printing services.
- **One-Click Solution:** Snap a picture of a key, enter credit card details, and receive a 3D printed key in the mail.
- **New York City "Master Keys" Debacle:** How long until 3D models become available? What will be the impact?
