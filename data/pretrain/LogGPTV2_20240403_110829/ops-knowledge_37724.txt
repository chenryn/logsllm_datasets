User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows 2003 Server freezes We currently have a web server running windows server 2003 with a combination of asp and asp.net sites.

This server has stopping responsing 3 times over the last 3 months, despite having the generation of a kernel memory dump and write an entry in the event logs when an bsod occurs nothing is been logged.  When viewing the server locally it is nonresponsive with a blank screen we have to power cycle the server to bring it back up.

After the last time we replaced all of the hardware with the expection of the hard disks, does anyone have any idea what could be causing this or what we should look at?

Thanks

Neil

Edit

One thing I've find in google is a blog posting saying that a fragmented hard disk could be the cause, as the disk is fragmented we will defrag it to see if that helps. Has anyone experienced this before?

Assistant: So is a BSOD actually occurring?  I'd recommend un-ticking the "automatically restart" option; this gives you a chance to actually see the BSOD.  If it is BSOD'ing, you'll be able to see the problem (e.g.: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL), hopefully the culprit (e.g.: XYZ.SYS) and the STOP code.
