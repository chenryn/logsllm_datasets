tools, such as Telegram, allow users to set up a passcode
to lock their accounts. However, 45 participants said they do
not set up a passcode because it is time-consuming to unlock
accounts. They see the phone lock of their handset as sufﬁcient
(i.e., Apple’s touch ID or passcode, Android’s pattern/PIN
lock). Others (P4, P11, P14, P15, P39, P40, P56) explicitly
said that locking the application has the undesirable effect of
being notiﬁed that a message has been received without the
sender’s name and text. This is another example of a security
feature reducing the utility users are looking for.
57 participants (excluding P2, P4 and P5) provided various
incorrect explanations of digital signatures: (1) inserting a
USB stick into the PC to sign a document using a unique
code, (2) scanning a hand-written signature and then adding
the signature electronically to a document, or (3) signing a
digital document using a stylus pen. P29 described a digital
signature as a speciﬁc font type in Microsoft Word used to
type names. Only P2 and P5 correctly explained what digital
signatures are.
We also asked about veriﬁcation ﬁngerprints, and only P2
was able to explain them. All participants who use Telegram,
for example, believe that the ﬁngerprint in the Secret Chat
mode is the encryption key shared between the sender and the
recipient to encrypt and decrypt messages in transit, or the
encrypted message itself.
Account Deletion. At
the beginning of the study, we
asked our participants to take out their mobile phones and
check all the communication tools they have downloaded. All
participants (except for P2, P4, P5 and P28) uninstalled a
communication tool when they decided to stop using it, be-
lieving their accounts and chat history have been removed. We
can attribute this misconception to misleading feedback from
devices: both iPhone and Nexus warn their users that their
data will be deleted if they “delete” a particular application.
The warning message does not specify whether “all” the data
deleted is the application-related data stored on the phone, or
the data associated with the account on the provider’s servers.
F. Security Ranking of Communication Services: Calling vs.
Messaging
We asked our participants to rank the communication tools
they have used in terms of how secure they are. Many partici-
pants ranked the services offered by the tools ﬁrst, rather than
ranking the tools. Our participants exhibited high agreement
on the relative ranking of services (calling and messaging).
All, but seven participants, agreed on the following ranking,
ordered from the most to least secure:
1) Voice calls via the mobile network.
2) Voice calls via the Internet (e.g., Wi-Fi).
3) SMS messages (mobile network).
4) Emails (Internet).
5) Instant messages (Internet).
Seven participants (P2, P5, P37, P42, P45, P47 and P51)
disagreed with the ranking above, noting that voice calls
have the same security level as messages because several
communication tools (e.g., WhatsApp, Google Hangouts) offer
both services.
Calls are more secure than messages. Below, we discuss
the reasons given by our participants for why calls are more
secure than messages:
1) According to most participants (53 out of 60), there
is no mass surveillance of phone calls. They are aware that
phone calls can be intercepted, but think it is unlikely unless a
government agency is monitoring a speciﬁc person. According
to P17, the calling parties “need to be targeted during their
conversation. This requires special wiretapping equipment”.
2) Nine participants believe that routine recording of phone
calls requires many resources, such as disk space. Hence, they
do not consider phone calls being recorded and stored on the
provider’s servers a threat. P17 also mentioned that text and
multimedia messages are “discarded from the servers as long
as they were not suspicious”. In fact, providers store messages
for long periods of time [72].
3) Nine participants mentioned that a phone call requires
a lot of time and effort to process and analyze, compared to
a text message. They stated that a human has to listen to a
phone call and extract the sensitive information (as portrayed
in movies, perhaps most memorably “The Lives of Others”).
It is onerous to convert audio to text for analysis, whereas
text messages can be easily searched for speciﬁc keywords.
We speculate this is because participants are used to word
processors that scan text for words, but have never seen this
technology for scanning audio.
4) Seven participants mentioned that there is a record of
text messages stored on the user’s device. They said that if
the user’s device gets compromised, the adversary can access
all previously sent messages, unless the user deletes their
chat history regularly (something none of our participants
regularly does). P12 also mentioned that it should be common
practice not to write sensitive information down on a piece
of paper or as a text message, regardless of whether the
tool is secure or not. Sensitive information should be shared
in person, or via a phone call (if the situation is urgent)

“because there is no chat history of calls”. 16 participants
mentioned that it is possible to capture a sensitive exchange
by taking a screen-shot of a message, not something attackers
can do with a phone call. This ﬁnding suggests users have a
rudimentary understanding of forward secrecy, unconnected to
the cryptographic deﬁnition.
SMS is the most secure messaging service. We have
discussed why users regard voice calls more secure than
messages above. We here provide the rationale behind why
SMS messages are perceived as the most secure, while emails
the second most secure, and instant messages the least secure.
According to our participants:
1) Telephone service providers, as opposed to email (and
IM) service providers, are regulated by the government. Hence,
the mobile phone network can protect against competing
companies seeking intelligence, as opposed to the Internet (33
out of 60).
2) Many banks send banking details and notiﬁcations (re-
garded as sensitive information by our participants) via SMS
messages, so SMS must be secure (32 out of 60).
3) SMS is accessible only through the “Messages” applica-
tion on the phone, whereas email systems and IM tools can
be accessed through the PC as well, increasing the scope of
vulnerability (P21, P26, P29, P39 and P50).
4) Emails and instant messages (text and multimedia mes-
sages) are less secure than SMS messages because email
systems and IM tools are “free” (30 out of 60), and the Internet
is less secure than other networks (e.g., 3G) (see point 1
above). According to P12, “privacy is a general problem of
the Internet”. In contrast, P2 and P5 believe it is possible to
communicate over the Internet securely if vulnerabilities do
not exist.
5) Email was designed to send formal messages and not
to socialize, as opposed to IM tools (28 out of 60). As far as
our participants are concerned, formality of messages indicates
better security. In contrast, P12 believes that Gmail (an email
service) and Google Hangouts (an IM tool) are one entity,
hence, they have the same level of security. Also, P17 and P24
mentioned that their Yahoo! email account has been hacked,
hence, Yahoo! Messenger is perceived as insecure because
Yahoo! email and Yahoo! Messenger are one entity. We discuss
this theme in more detail in Section IV-G.
Some participants (29 out of 60) believe that “professional”
email (e.g., Outlook, P11’s university email) is more secure
than “commercial” email services (e.g., Gmail), provided that
the sender and the recipient have professional email accounts.
According to P11, there is no clear evidence that Outlook is
more secure than Gmail. However, since she receives more
spam emails in her Gmail’s spam folder, she believes that
Gmail is less secure. Also, P11’s university sends regular
warnings about spam emails, which is interpreted as a sign
that the university cares about protecting Outlook, as opposed
to Gmail that “only has a folder for spams”. Here, we have
an example of effortful but visible security that makes the
participant believe that Outlook is secure, whereas security
being done automatically (i.e., the ﬁltering done by Gmail)
makes her perceive Gmail as insecure due to invisible security.
Other participants (15 out of 60) feel secure as long as
they use their university email account, even if the recipient
does not use the same email system. P14 and P18 believe
that the university email account is more secure than Gmail
because the university (an educational, non-proﬁt organization)
owns the service and is responsible for protecting it. This
misconception can be attributed to the ego-centric models
explained earlier in Section IV-E.
G. Security Ranking Criteria of Communication Tools
We here discuss the reasons for our participants’ rankings
of the communication tools they have used, not the services
offered by the tools. We provided participants with cards with
the names and logos of the tools, and then asked them to
rank them from the most to the least secure. Our aim was
not to analyze the rankings, but to elicit the rationale behind
our participants’ choices. We found that our participants base
their security rankings of communication tools on several
adoption criteria discussed earlier in Section IV-A, namely
(1) users bases, (2) QoS, (3) cost of use, (4) registration:
telephone numbers vs. usernames, and (5) social inﬂuence,
rather than on the security properties they expect from a
secure tool. Below, we discuss the different reasons given by
our participants to justify their rankings of the tools (without
necessarily mentioning the most recurrent reasons ﬁrst).
User bases. 20 participants believe that popular communi-
cation tools (e.g., Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp) have large
user bases and, hence, they are more likely to be targeted. 10
participants, on the other hand, believe that Facebook Mes-
senger is more secure than Yahoo! Messenger because more
people use the former and, hence, there is more investment to
secure it.
QoS. The QoS our participants experience while using a
tool inﬂuences their perceptions of how secure the tool is
(40 out of 60). For example, P7 and P17 said that Viber
has low audio/video quality: “the signal is bad, and there
are continuous disconnections” (P7), which means it is also
less secure compared to other tools. P12 believes that Google
Hangouts is secure because its audio/video quality is better
than that of, for example, Skype.
Cost of use. 40 participants mentioned that “cheap” tools
should not be trusted. For example, P59 thinks that Blackberry
Messenger Protected offers better security compared to “other
free tools” because its subscription cost is high. 22 participants
also said that tools with advertisements are insecure.
Registration: telephone numbers vs. usernames. 27 par-
ticipants perceive WhatsApp as more secure than other tools
because it requires a phone number when creating an account.
They said that using the phone number is a guarantee the
account can only be accessed from the users’ phone. The
phone is seen as strongly linked to the communication partner,
whereas other IM tools that require a username and a password
can be “easily hacked”. P2, P5 and P48 see no difference
between both methods.

Integration with other tools. 25 participants distrust tools
used in combination with other less secure tools. For instance,
10 participants said that if a user imports their personal details
from Facebook to WhatsApp, WhatsApp’s security will drop
to that of Facebook.
Tools integrated with SMS. Many participants believe that
SMS is more secure than IM for several reasons previously
discussed in Section IV-F. However, 12 participants who use
iMessage and Google Hangouts on their phone have the mis-
conception that these two IM tools are equivalent to SMS and,
hence, have the same security level. For instance, P6 stated
that “iMessage is designed as part of Apple’s SMS service”.
He sends banking details via iMessage for this reason.
Attractive UIs. 22 participants stated that if the tool creators
care enough to make the tool usable, they will also care
about its security. A “bad” (unattractive) UI is a sign that the
developer “does not care” or is not competent, so the security
of the tool is also likely to be shoddy. P17 and P23 cited Kik
and Ebuddy XMS as examples. This ﬁnding shows that a good
user experience on one aspect of the tool increases trust in the
competence and motivation of the developers.
Visible security. Visible security indicates “there must be
a threat”. 21 participants believe that the mobile version of a
communication tool is more secure than other tools accessed
via browsers because users do not have to deal with HTTPS
locks and certiﬁcates. Hence, they prefer to have a stand-
alone desktop application similar to that on the mobile phone.
According to P27, “the information is just on your device, it
is not easy to access data on a personal device, as opposed
to the web browser”.
An emerging theme is that our participants’ experience of
warning messages and need for security indicators lead them
to perceive the services they access via web browsers as
insecure. Applications on mobile phones have comparatively
fewer indicators and warnings and are, thus, perceived to be
more secure, despite this being technically incorrect [73], [74].
30 participants also think that the probability of a mobile
phone getting infected by a “virus” is lower than that of a
PC because (1) they have never experienced any issue with
their phones, unlike PCs, and have never installed a mobile
phone version of an anti-virus program, and (2) the sender of
an instant message is known, unlike SMS and email: “there
are spam emails, but not spam instant messages” (P18).
Social inﬂuence. Social factors largely inﬂuence partici-
pants’ perceptions of the security offered by a communication
tool (54 out of 60). Some tools are deemed more secure
and trustworthy than others because a friend, colleague, or
newspaper article said so.
Geopolitical context. The local laws and practices that
a service provider is subject
to inﬂuence perception. P12
believes Facebook Messenger is less secure than other tools
because Facebook is US-based. She believes that US gov-
ernment agencies, the NSA in particular, are able to read
transmitted data. Hence, she does not share sensitive infor-
mation via Facebook Messenger. Five participants mentioned
that Threema is the most secure tool because Germans “who
are more privacy-concerned” use it extensively, showing the
“crowd follower” characteristics described in [75].
Self-destructing messages. P15 and P43 believe Telegram’s
Secret Chat mode deceives participants into thinking that
messages are deleted from the recipient side, when they are
actually stored on the server. They compare Telegram to
Snapchat and believe both are insecure.
Open-source vs. proprietary tools. Kerckhoffs’ principle
of avoiding security-by-obscurity is well-established in the
cryptographic literature. However, 51 out of 60 participants
largely believe obscurity is necessary for security. P6, P12,
P13, P18, P26, P36 and P59 explicitly stated that Apple
products are secure because they are closed-source. However,
Garman et al. found signiﬁcant vulnerabilities in iMessage
that can be exploited [76]. Our participants are not aware of
the long line of cases where proprietary encryption schemes
have been broken, despite recent high-proﬁle cases, such as
the Volkswagen key [77].
Finally, seven participants (P3, P4, P8, P11, P19, P22 and
P26) did not rank the communication tools, perceiving them
to have the same level of security for several reasons:
No clear understanding of security. P3, P4, P8, P11
and P26 did not compare the tools. They said they do not
