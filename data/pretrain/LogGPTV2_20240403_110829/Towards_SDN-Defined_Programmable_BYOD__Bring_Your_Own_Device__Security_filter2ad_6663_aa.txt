## Abstract
The increasing adoption of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) in corporate environments has introduced new security challenges. While existing solutions like Mobile Device Management (MDM) focus on device data control and protection, they lack the capability to provide a comprehensive network security system. This paper introduces PBS (Programmable BYOD Security), a novel security solution that leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enable fine-grained, application-level network security programmability. PBS abstracts mobile device elements into conventional SDN network elements, allowing for context-aware, app-specific policy enforcement without significant overhead on mobile devices or the need for SDN switches in enterprise networks. We implement a prototype system, PBS-DROID, for Android devices, and our evaluation demonstrates that PBS is an effective and practical solution for BYOD security.

## 1. Introduction
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a paradigm shift in the modern workplace, enabling enterprises to leverage employee-owned devices while reducing the cost overhead of device acquisition. However, this shift also introduces new security challenges, as traditional management and security solutions are not well-suited to handle the dynamic nature of BYOD devices. Existing solutions, such as Google's Android Device Administration (ADA) and Mobile Device Management (MDM), primarily focus on device and app data control, but lack the necessary network management features for comprehensive security.

In this paper, we propose PBS (Programmable BYOD Security), a new security solution that addresses these challenges by providing fine-grained, programmable network policy enforcement for BYOD devices. PBS is inspired by the principles of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which offers network-wide visibility, programmability, and control. Unlike traditional SDN, PBS does not require changes to the existing network infrastructure; instead, it applies the SDN concept to mobile devices, abstracting them as logical switches with apps as logical hosts and network interfaces as logical ports.

## 2. Background and Problem Statement
### 2.1. Background of SDN
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a networking architecture that separates the control plane from the data plane, enabling centralized control and programmability. SDN provides a global view of the network, allowing for dynamic and flexible policy enforcement. In the context of BYOD, SDN can be used to manage and secure mobile devices more effectively.

### 2.2. Challenges in BYOD Security
#### 2.2.1. Application Awareness and Network Visibility
A key challenge in BYOD security is maintaining a holistic view of devices and their application behaviors on the network. Traditional monitoring tools can observe basic device connection activities, but they lack the ability to provide detailed information about application contexts and network flows. For example, applications may use network interfaces (e.g., 3G/4G) that are not visible to the network administrator, making it difficult to enforce detailed management policies.

#### 2.2.2. Enforcing Network-Wide Security Policies
Enforcing network-wide security policies on BYOD devices is critical. For instance, an administrator may want to restrict access to a data server to only specific enterprise-allowed applications when a device is in the server room. Traditional methods, such as static firewall rules, cannot account for device and application contexts, and they cannot react to changing network dynamics.

#### 2.2.3. Dynamic Policy Programming
Dynamic policy programming is essential for managing BYOD devices. Administrators may need to specify time- and location-based restrictions for applications, or dynamically redirect suspicious traffic for further inspection. Traditional security solutions, such as ACLs and firewalls, are inflexible and difficult to manage in dynamic, application-aware security policy enforcement scenarios.

## 3. Research Questions
Motivated by the challenges outlined above, we address the following research questions:
- Can traditional security solutions be effectively used for dynamic, application-aware security policy enforcement in BYOD scenarios?
- How can we design a system that provides fine-grained, context-aware, and programmable network policy enforcement for BYOD devices?

## 4. Design of PBS
### 4.1. Overview
PBS is a two-tiered network-wide policy enforcement scheme that leverages SDN/OpenFlow techniques to control BYOD devices. The system consists of a remote controller and a client component, PBS-DROID, running on Android devices. The controller runs user-defined security policy programs, while PBS-DROID enforces these policies at the device level.

### 4.2. System Architecture
#### 4.2.1. Logical Abstraction
PBS abstracts mobile devices as logical switches, with apps as logical hosts and network interfaces as logical ports. This abstraction allows for the application of SDN principles to mobile devices, enabling fine-grained, context-aware, and dynamic policy control.

#### 4.2.2. Policy Language
To facilitate ease of use, PBS introduces a rich policy language that enables administrators to specify device management decisions without requiring intricate knowledge of SDN. This lowers the barrier of entry for real-world use cases.

### 4.3. Implementation
We implemented a prototype system, PBS-DROID, for Android devices, and an enterprise network PBS controller instantiated in an SDN controller. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of PBS in providing fine-grained, programmable network policy enforcement for BYOD devices.

## 5. Evaluation
### 5.1. Performance Evaluation
We evaluated PBS-DROID using real-world Android applications. The results show that PBS-DROID introduces negligible performance overhead and minor impact on battery life, while achieving the desired policy control functions for BYOD.

### 5.2. Use Cases
We present several use cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of PBS in various scenarios, including time- and location-based access control, and dynamic policy updates in response to changing network conditions.

## 6. Related Work
We review related work in the areas of BYOD security, MDM, and SDN, highlighting the unique contributions of PBS in addressing the challenges of dynamic, application-aware security policy enforcement.

## 7. Conclusion
This paper presents PBS, a novel security solution for BYOD that leverages SDN to provide fine-grained, programmable network policy enforcement. Our evaluation demonstrates that PBS is an effective and practical solution for BYOD security, offering a holistic and dynamic approach to managing and securing mobile devices in enterprise networks.
