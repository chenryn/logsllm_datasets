Abstract—An emerging trend in corporate network admin-
istration is BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). Although with
many advantages, the paradigm shift presents new challenges in
security to enterprise networks. While existing solutions such as
Mobile Device Management (MDM) focus mainly on controlling
and protecting device data, they fall short in providing a holistic
network protection system. New innovation is needed in providing
administrators with sophisticated network policies and control
capabilities over the devices and mobile applications (apps). In
this paper, we present PBS (Programmable BYOD Security),
a new security solution to enable ﬁne-grained, application-
level network security programmability for the purpose of
network management and policy enforcement on mobile apps
and devices. Our work is motivated by another emerging and
powerful concept, SDN (Software-Deﬁned Networking). With
a novel abstraction of mobile device elements (e.g., apps and
network interfaces on the device) into conventional SDN network
elements, PBS intends to provide network-wide, context-aware,
app-speciﬁc policy enforcement at run-time without introducing
much overhead on a resource-constrained mobile device, and
without the actual deployment of SDN switches in enterprise
networks. We implement a prototype system of PBS, with a
controller component that runs a BYOD policy program on
existing SDN controllers and a client component, PBS-DROID,
for Android devices. Our evaluation shows that PBS is an effective
and practical solution for BYOD security.

INTRODUCTION
BYOD is the new paradigm in the workplace. The enter-
prise is facing growing limitations of traditional infrastructure,
rising cost overheads, and a slowing pace in adopting new
technology. In lieu of utilizing company resources to keep up
with the torrential downpour of new devices and gadgets year
after year, BYOD enables the enterprise to leverage employee-
owned devices in the workplace. This fresh concept, bring
your own device, shifts the cost overhead of device ownership
away from the corporation. No longer do administrators and
infrastructure managers handle acquisition of new hardware.
The tempting offer of ofﬂoading the cost of device acquisition
onto the employee has seen a rapid growth in adaptation

amongst enterprise networks. In fact, studies in 2012 [16]
have shown that 44% of users in developed countries and
75% in developing countries are now utilizing BYOD in the
workplace. This adoption rate shows no signs of slowing, and
we cannot ignore this paradigm shift.
traditionally fostered by administrators,
The crux of BYOD, however, is its close and convoluted
interplay with network security. While some of the physical
devices have changed ownership,
the role of management
remains ﬁrmly in the realm of corporate administrators. Mis-
management by the users potentially opens the workplace to
an array of unwanted or even malicious applications. Providing
device security,
is
now made signiﬁcantly more complex in BYOD. Today, the
challenge for administrators is the management of dynamic
BYOD-enabled devices and the diverse apps running on them.
Migrating to-and-from work,
this new breed of corporate
device leaves the safe haven of the company at the end of
the workday. These devices require additional security against
outside threats. More importantly, the corporate network itself
now needs more security and management capabilities to
handle its devices. Without proper management
the
beneﬁt provided by BYOD is overshadowed by the holes
created in the enterprise security environment.
tools,
Existing solutions have sought to plug the gap in device
management through on-device administration and network-
wide device management systems. For example, Google has
provided such a system, Android Device Administration
(ADA), as early as Android 2.2. This system seeks to provide
management features via APIs [2], which facilitate the creation
of security-aware applications on the device. Capabilities such
as strong password policy enforcement and remote device wip-
ing are natively provided by ADA. However, today’s complex
deployments require more features and dynamic reconﬁgura-
bility in order to effectively manage and secure the evolving
network. Recent systems, such as Mobile Device Management
(MDM) solutions proposed in
[3], [5], [6], [8], [4], have
come to supplement ADA and have led the technical trend
in BYOD management. These solutions provide additional
granularity and complexity in management capabilities. More
recently, Android for Work [1] introduced a dedicated “Work
Proﬁle” to separate corporate and personal application data for
BYOD deployments. The proﬁle supports OS-level encryption
and additional management APIs to third-party MDM/Enter-
prise Mobility Management (EMM) partners via ADA. This
enabled administrators to build new management solutions for
employee devices.
However, these solutions focus mainly on device/app data
control and protection (e.g., through domain isolation as in
Samsung KNOX [7] and Android for Work [1]). They lack
sufﬁcient network management features, such as ﬁne-grained
network security policy enforcement or access control, which
are imperative to a comprehensive enterprise device manage-
ment scenario. One practice may attempt to apply existing
security policies to new BYOD devices using extra network
access control solutions/infrastructure. Yet simple adoption of
traditional solutions is not well-suited to reﬂect dynamics of
BYOD devices.
Complementing existing work, our approach focuses on
addressing the issues posed by BYOD in the context of mobile
devices, such as phones and tablets. Our intent is to provide a
new system for BYOD management which features dynamic
programmability and security policy enforcement with un-
precedented granularity. Different from existing solutions, we
do not aim to control user actions or the device storage implic-
itly. Rather, we wish to secure and manage the network access
capabilities of the BYOD device, with high ﬁdelity such as
individual-application-speciﬁc and device-context-aware net-
work access. We seek to provide such detailed access control
in a sophisticated and easy-to-use system, providing a holistic
network-wide management platform.
A unique requirement in today’s mobile BYOD networks is
the management of the dynamic network devices. In this case,
the device may physically move or change its run-time contexts
(e.g., add/remove applications) during its operation. While the
device exists on the network, administrators require real-time
adaptability and control of device network actions. For in-
stance, while an administrator wishes to restrict network com-
munication between speciﬁc apps/devices/network-resources,
they may not possess intricate knowledge of all applications
which enable such functionality. It may be useful
to ﬁrst
learn device communication behavior and context information
(e.g., location, time) and then programmatically apply a policy
which limits unwanted capability in the workplace. Thus, an
administrator requires additional capabilities to complement
existing management systems. Such capabilities require rich
granularity and dynamic conﬁgurability, which are difﬁcult to
provide in existing, mostly static management systems.
To address these dynamic network management concerns,
we propose our system, PBS (Programmable BYOD Security),
a new security solution to bring ﬁne-grained, programmable
network policy enforcement to BYOD devices in enterprise
networks. Our solution is inspired by the concept of Software-
Deﬁned Networking (SDN), which provides a new networking
architecture to enable network-wide visibility, programmabil-
ity, and control. Different from existing SDN techniques that
require revolutionary changes and replacement of the network
equipment infrastructure, such as routers and switches, PBS
applies the SDN concept to the mobile-device level hardware,
and does not require any changes to the existing network
infrastructure (i.e., PBS does not require the actual deploy-
ment of SDN/OpenFlow network switches). Analogous to
conventional SDN, yet tailored to mobile environment, we
abstract a user’s mobile device as a logical switch, with apps
running on the device as logical hosts and all the available
network interfaces as logical ports. We map the user’s context
and mobile device management features to functionalities of
SDN. We extend conventional SDN ﬂow control capabilities
to perform ﬁne-grained app-level, context-aware, dynamic,
programmable policy control. Our remote PBS controller can
run a user-deﬁned security policy program that controls and
monitors application-aware ﬂows with the user’s contexts at
the mobile device level at run-time; thereby, all the ﬂows
between applications and device network interfaces are visible
and programmable with ease. Additionally, in order to facilitate
ease of use of the remote controller, PBS introduces a rich
policy language for the conﬁguration and management of
BYOD devices. The policy language enables the enterprise
administrator to specify device management decisions without
modifying the PBS controller program, thus allowing the easy
administration of PBS and its management devices without
intricate knowledge of SDN, lowering the barrier of entry for
real world use cases.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• We propose a novel two-tiered network-wide policy
enforcement scheme to control BYOD devices based
upon SDN/OpenFlow techniques. Different from ex-
isting architecture of SDN/OpenFlow, our approach
leverages novel
transparent application abstraction,
efﬁcient ﬂow-policy architecture, and optimization
schemes, which are tailored to mobile BYOD devices.
Our solution empowers global visibility and ﬂexible
security programmability to enterprise BYOD network
administrators as well as reactive policy update in
Android devices.
• We present dynamic and ﬁne-grained access control
over context-aware ﬂows at a mobile application level.
In particular, we dynamically enforce access control
logic over application ﬂows by considering the run-
time contexts of mobile users.
• We design and implement a PBS client prototype
system on Android, called PBS-DROID, as well as
an enterprise network PBS controller instantiated in
an SDN controller. We choose Android because it is
open-source and dominating the mobile device market.
Our techniques should be applicable to other mobile
platforms, or even the regular PC platform.
• We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of
PBS-DROID with real-world Android applications.
The results show that PBS-DROID introduces a neg-
ligible performance overhead and minor impact to
battery life, while achieving desired policy control
functions for BYOD.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces the background of SDN/OpenFlow and problem
statement. Section III provides design details of our PBS
solution. Performance evaluations with use cases are presented
in Section IV and further discussions are addressed in Section
V. We review related work in Section VI and conclude the
paper in Section VII.
II. BACKGROUND & PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this section, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the background
of SDN. Next, we motivate the need for a dynamic, pro-
grammable system for the granular management of BYOD

doing so, the employer beneﬁts in a reduced cost overhead
associated with physical device acquisition. However, support-
ing employee-owned devices creates new issues in network
administration and security.
Application Awareness & Network Visibility. A key issue
in BYOD enterprise network administration is the maintenance
of a holistic view of devices and their application behaviors
on the network. Although it is possible to observe basic device
connection activities via traditional network monitoring tools.
Advanced information, such as device context and detailed
application-connection information is invisible to traditional
tools. For example, an application could send data through
a network interface, such as 3G/4G interfaces, normally not
visible to the enterprise network administrator. Furthermore, it
is currently not possible to correlate application network activ-
ities with the hosting device’s physical location. Such physical
information is highly useful in crafting detailed management
policies in the enterprise, but cannot be discerned by traditional
tools.
Additionally, the issue of enforcing network-wide security
policies on BYOD devices is of critical
importance. For
example, a scenario in which the administrator attempts to
restrict access to company resources, such as a data server,
only to a speciﬁc enterprise-allowed application while a
device is present in the server room. Access restriction by
devices could be implemented by traditional infrastructure via
a static scheme, e.g., a network-wide ﬁrewall rule. However,
it has two limitations: First, existing methods cannot account
for device and application context, e.g., application context,
mobile location, and network ﬂow information speciﬁc to
the device/application; Second, static policies cannot react
to changing network dynamics. For instance, events such as
new devices entering the network, device context updates or
suspicious activity analysis all require additional logic beyond
static conﬁguration.
Dynamic Policy Programming. The ability to provide
dynamic policy programming/updates is a key motivation in
our work. For example, a network administrator may wish to
provide application-speciﬁc time and location context restric-
tion, such as allowing social media applications only during
lunch hours and in areas designated as break areas during
predeﬁned hours. It would also be advantageous to specify
dynamic policies, capable of redirecting malicious/suspicious
trafﬁc for further inspection or quarantine at security middle
boxes, e.g., in the case of a device/application which suddenly
exhibits suspicious network behavior.
C. Research Questions
The aforementioned functions require detailed, ﬁne-grained
device and application monitoring not possible in existing
solutions. Motivated by the issues outlined above, we discuss
the following research questions.
•
Can we use traditional solutions? Traditional secu-
rity solutions (e.g., ACLs/ﬁrewalls) are difﬁcult and
inﬂexible to program, deploy, and manage in dy-
namic, network- and application-aware security policy
enforcement for BYOD scenarios. Also, traditional
access control policies are typically coupled with
physical devices/resources instead of applications. We
