    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import { Lower } from "./lower";
    import "./styles.css";
    function App() {
      const [state, setState] = React.useState("nochange");
      const change = () => {
        console.log("runs");
        setState("change");
      };
      return (
           change()}>click to change
      );
    }
    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
    ReactDOM.render(, rootElement);
    import React from "react";
    export const Lower = props => {
      const [state, setState] = React.useState(1);
      console.log(props.mode);
      React.useEffect(() => {
        props.mode === "change" && setState(2);
      });
      return state;
    };
My repo is https://codesandbox.io/s/kkkl61mrzv and I am trying to send a prop
to my child via manipulating the state with the new hooks. the component does
work however in my console.log I can see that the component rerenders quite a
few times. please help me find a proper way to have this done with rerendering
once.
