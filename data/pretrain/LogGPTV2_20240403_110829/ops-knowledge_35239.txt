User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Shell command to monitor changes in a file I know there was a command on Unix that I could use to monitor a file and see changes that are getting written to it. This was quite useful especially for checking log files.

Do you know what it is called?

Assistant: Do you mean 

tail -f logfile.log


?

(Man page for tail)
