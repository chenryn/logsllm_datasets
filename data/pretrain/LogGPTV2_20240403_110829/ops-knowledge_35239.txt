**Question:**
I recall there was a Unix command that allows me to monitor a file and see changes as they are written to it. This is particularly useful for checking log files. Could you tell me what this command is called?

**Answer:**
Are you referring to the `tail -f` command? For example:

```sh
tail -f logfile.log
```

This command will display the last 10 lines of the file and continue to show new lines as they are added. 

For more information, you can refer to the `tail` man page.
