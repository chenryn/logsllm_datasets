# A keyboard shortcut to change the current fancyzones template to a next
template in a list
Let's say I mostly use a two column configuration on my main desktop but I
would like sometimes to have three columns or divide the desktop on four areas
so I have three templates that I would like to use in the same desktop but in
order to switch between them I have to go to the app settings and set the
template.
I would like to:  
1- Add the templates I create or use the default templates to a list that is
assigned to the desktop  
2- When I press the keyboard shortcut key to change to the next template in
the list the zones are displayed on top of the current windows and they are
selected when I release the keys from the keyboard.
