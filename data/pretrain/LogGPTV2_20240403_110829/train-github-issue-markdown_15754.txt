### Proposal for a Keyboard Shortcut to Switch Between FancyZones Templates

**Background:**
I primarily use a two-column layout on my main desktop. However, there are times when I need to switch to a three-column layout or divide the desktop into four areas. Currently, switching between these templates requires navigating to the app settings and manually selecting the desired template.

**Objective:**
To streamline this process, I propose the following enhancements:

1. **Template List Assignment:**
   - Allow users to add custom templates or select from default templates and assign them to a specific desktop.
   - This list of templates should be easily manageable, allowing users to add, remove, or reorder templates as needed.

2. **Keyboard Shortcut for Template Switching:**
   - Implement a keyboard shortcut that cycles through the assigned templates in the list.
   - When the shortcut is pressed, the next template in the list should be previewed on top of the current windows.
   - The new template should be applied and the zones selected once the user releases the keyboard keys.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. **Setup:**
   - Users can define a list of templates for each desktop.
   - These templates can be custom or chosen from the default options provided by the application.

2. **Switching Templates:**
   - Press the designated keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + T`).
   - The next template in the list is displayed as an overlay on the current desktop.
   - Upon releasing the keys, the new template is applied, and the zones are activated, ready for window placement.

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Quickly switch between different layouts without navigating through settings.
- **Customization:** Tailor the list of templates to specific desktops and workflows.
- **User Experience:** A more intuitive and seamless way to manage and switch between different zone configurations.

By implementing these features, users will have a more efficient and flexible way to manage their desktop layouts, enhancing productivity and workflow.
