I want to log the commands executed by all users on the server. Is there any better way than using script command?

Assistant: A possible application to do this is rootsh. see: http://sourceforge.net/projects/rootsh/

Be careful though, you will be capturing all sorts of passwords, confidential data and other things that need to be stored in the highest security you have available. Think of what could happen if this information was captured. Also, depending on the number of users on your system there could be a lot of data.
