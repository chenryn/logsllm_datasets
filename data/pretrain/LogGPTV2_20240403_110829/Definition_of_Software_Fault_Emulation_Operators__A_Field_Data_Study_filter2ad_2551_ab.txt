### 3.3 Detailed Classification and Fault Emulation Discussion

For practical fault injection, the fault types provided by Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) are too broad, encompassing many different faults under the same category. Clearly, further refinement is necessary, not as an alternative classification but as an additional layer of detail to ODC.

We propose to implement this step by analyzing faults from the perspective of the program context in which they occur and relating them to programming language constructs. From this perspective, a defect can be one or more programming language constructs (statements, expressions, etc.) that are either missing, wrong, or extraneous. According to this idea, we classified each fault based on its nature, which can be one of the following: Missing Construct, Wrong Construct, or Extraneous Construct. This classification is particularly pertinent for fault emulation, as emulating an omission (missing construct) is substantially different from emulating an extraneous construct.

As shown in Table 4, faults of the extraneous nature are less frequent than the other two categories, with missing programming constructs being the dominant type of software bug.

Table 5 presents the total number of missing, wrong, or extraneous faults for each of the five ODC fault types addressed in this work. As we can see, for the assignment and interface types, missing program construct faults are less frequent than wrong construct faults.

**Table 5 - Fault Nature Totals Across ODC Types**

| ODC Types | Missing | Wrong | Extraneous |

Sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.5 present the occurrences of all faults collected according to their nature and source program. Each fault type is assigned a code for easier reference.

#### 3.3.1 Assignment Faults

Table 6 shows the results for assignment faults. Faults related to initialization were considered different from general assignment faults. Missing parts of logical expressions were considered different from situations where a logical expression was completely wrong.
