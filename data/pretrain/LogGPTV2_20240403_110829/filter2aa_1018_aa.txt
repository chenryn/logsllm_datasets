### 1.0 Role of Smart Meters

The global electrical grid is rapidly transitioning to smart meters, as evidenced by numerous public disclosures of smart meter sales and implementations.1 Smart meters, a key component of a utility's Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), enhance the stability, efficiency, and reliability of the modern electrical grid. They provide utilities with accurate, real-time, and historical consumption data, enabling better management and peak load reduction.2,3

While smart meters offer significant benefits, they also introduce new security challenges. Utilities have long relied on the stability and resilience of their hardware, with some equipment lasting over 40 years.4 The initial focus on reliability has led to design considerations that may not fully address the security implications of AMI. As smart meters include features such as two-way communications, microcontrollers, data storage, and radios, they become more vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation. This has sparked a race to secure these devices from potential threats posed by both amateur enthusiasts and criminals.

### 2.0 Risk Presented by the Optical Port

The optical port on a smart meter allows field technicians to directly manage individual meters, ensuring reliability under various field conditions. To interact with the optical port, attackers or security researchers must either obtain the vendor’s maintenance software or develop specialized software. Both scenarios require authentication credentials, which can be extracted from the meter's components, including microcontroller firmware and memory.

On January 5, 2009, InGuardians, as part of the AMI Security Acceleration Project Red Team, released the AMI Attack Methodology. Updated to version 2 on March 1, 2011, this methodology outlines techniques for extracting information from smart meter components. These methods, while not novel, consolidate the knowledge required for analyzing embedded devices.

Valuable data can often be extracted by following the steps in the AMI Attack Methodology. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate common methods for extracting data from EEPROM and NAND Flash components, respectively.

**Figure 2:** Extracting NAND Flash Data Using XELTEK SuperPro 5000

Extracting and identifying significant information are separate tasks. Prior knowledge of data locations, such as security codes and encryption keys, can aid in this process. Brute force methods can be used to identify useful data, but these actions should be detectable through proper logging. Component-to-component bus monitoring can also help in identifying sensitive information, as shown in Figure 3.

If hardware extraction methods fail, attackers may resort to brute-force attacks. However, well-designed security codes can make this approach impractical due to the vast number of possible combinations. Dictionaries generated with common vendor names, utility names, and default passwords can narrow the possibilities.

Once the security code is identified, communication via the optical port requires the appropriate software and equipment. Each smart meter vendor provides specific software, and optical probes, like the one in Figure 4, are commonly used to connect to meters.

Utilities and vendors are aware of the risks associated with the optical port. Unauthorized access can lead to several concerns:

- **Disconnect/Reconnect:** Remote control of meter connections.
- **Rate Modification:** Altering meter settings to change calculated consumption.
- **Attack Platform:** Modifying meters to interact with other devices and networks.
- **Brand Impact:** Negative public perception due to successful attacks.

### 3.0 OptiGuard

Developing tools to communicate with smart meters and AMI components starts with understanding communication standards. In North America, ANSI standards C12.18, C12.21, and C12.22 define AMI communications, while C12.19 describes the protocol for formatting standard and manufacturer-based information. European standards include IEC 62056-21, 62056-53, and 62056-61.

OptiGuard is a collection of Python modules designed to provide C12.18 and C12.19 communication and assessment capabilities. The libraries manage the sending and receiving of C12.18 packets and can parse C12.19 information. A Python-based serial interface is included for direct hardware interactions and to leverage optical probes used by field technicians.

Three communication clients are included in the OptiGuard toolkit, tested with various meters but may require modifications for different manufacturers and models. The `c12_18_hw_client.py` script generates and sends C12.18/19 messages, and the `c12_18_csv_parser.py` tool parses captured messages.

**Usage:**
```bash
user$ python c12_18_hw_client.py -h
Usage: c12_18_hw_client.py [-h] [-D] [-P ] [-f ] [-no] -a  
[-t ] [-d ] [-p ] [-s ] [-lp ]
   -h: print help
   -D: turn on debugging statements
   -P : Start pause seconds
   -a : Perform specific action:
       test_login
       read_table: requires -t and table number or defaults to 0
       read_decade: requires -d and decade number or defaults to 0
```
