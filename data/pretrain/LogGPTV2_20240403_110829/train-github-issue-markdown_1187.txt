# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement
I would like to request the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI) for settings and preferences. This will allow users to easily configure and manage their settings through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To implement this feature, we can develop a GUI that provides a visual representation of all available settings and preferences. The GUI should include:

1. **User-Friendly Design**: A clean and intuitive layout that makes it easy for users to find and modify their settings.
2. **Categorization**: Group settings into logical categories (e.g., General, Security, Notifications) to help users navigate more efficiently.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Ensure that changes made in the GUI are applied immediately and reflect in the application.
4. **Validation and Feedback**: Provide real-time validation and feedback to users as they make changes, to prevent incorrect configurations.
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the GUI is accessible to users with disabilities, following best practices for accessibility standards.

This GUI will enhance the user experience by providing a more interactive and visually appealing way to manage settings and preferences.
