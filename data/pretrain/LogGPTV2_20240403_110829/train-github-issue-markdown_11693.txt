The recent update of the Express types break all my apps because
`express.Response` obviously no longer has any accessible properties. Example:

Not sure if I might be using it incorrectly but since I also only see one tiny
test with a very specific testcase (sending `json()` as response) I think
there's a chance that this is a bug.
