Kind of an edge case I would say, but still it would be nice to get an error
or have an automatic renaming of the columns. If a simple error is acceptable
as a first step I could definitely put together a PR.
The following snippet shows that when you concatenate a column of zeros and a
column of ones the resulting dataframe has two columns of ones:
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    ts0 = pd.Series(np.zeros(5))
    ts1 = pd.Series(np.ones(5))
    ts0.name = ts1.name = 'same name'
    df = pd.concat([ts0, ts1], axis=1)
    print df
and the output (pandas 0.10.1):
       same name  same name
    0          1          1
    1          1          1
    2          1          1
    3          1          1
    4          1          1
whereas I would expect:
       same name  same name
    0          0          1
    1          0          1
    2          0          1
    3          0          1
    4          0          1
Looks like this is due to `pandas.tools.merge._Concatenator._get_concat_axis`
which doesn't check for name uniqueness, here is the relevant snippet:
    names = []
    for x in self.objs:
        if x.name is not None:
            names.append(x.name)
        else:
            return Index(np.arange(len(self.objs))
    return Index(names)
