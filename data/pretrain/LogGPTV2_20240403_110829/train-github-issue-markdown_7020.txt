### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * `7.1.8`
  * **Operating System:**
    * `macOS 10.13.6`
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * `N/A`
### Expected Behavior
`titleBarStyle: 'customButtonsOnHover'` should only affect the buttons and not
change the shape of the window to be a rectangle
### Actual Behavior
The buttons are rendered properly, but the window loses its rounded corners
**Here's a sample of the upper-right corner of a window with each mode:**

**Left** \- `'hidden'`  
**Right** \- `'customButtonsOnHover'`
### To Reproduce
Create a `BrowserWindow` with `titleBarStyle: 'customButtonsOnHover'` and
observe the lack of rounded borders
### Additional Information
`customButtonsOnHover` didn't work at all in `4.1.5`, so it's really awesome
to see it working so close to perfectly!
