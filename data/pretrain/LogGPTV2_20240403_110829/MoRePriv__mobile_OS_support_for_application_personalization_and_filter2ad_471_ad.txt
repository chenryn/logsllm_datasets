spell-checking, and voice recognition on the persona.
6.1 Personalization Scenarios
RSS News Feed Personalization: To test the usefulness of the
MOREPRIV APIs, we built a custom RSS reader called MoRSS.
This app pulls stories from 10 RSS news feeds, and samples from
these feeds to display a list of stories to the user. MoRSS disables
the OS-level GUI enhancements described in Section 4. Instead,
MoRSS relies on the built-in table in Figure 3 to rate how interest-
ing each feed will be to each persona.
MoRSS can operate with no personalization, in which case sto-
ries from each RSS feed will be sampled uniformly and displayed
to the user in the order in which they are sampled. When person-
alization is enabled, MoRSS queries the MOREPRIV API to deter-
mine the top persona of the user’s proﬁle, and then samples accord-
ing to the column of Figure 3 for that persona.
MoRSS demonstrates the advantages of exposing limited infor-
mation to third party applications: Developers have the ﬂexibility
to reinterpret the top proﬁle in any way that they see ﬁt. Apps such
as MoRSS are free to sample tech stories for the homemaker, even
though the built-in Bayesian classiﬁer for that proﬁle does not have
tech keywords. Furthermore, the personalization can be done in a
privacy-preserving way: MoRSS uses client-side personalization,
so even the owner of the RSS feeds cannot learn the top proﬁle of
the user from the requests that MoRSS makes.
Application Skinning: OS-level personalization has broad appli-
cability, even beyond networked device use. As a demonstration,
we implemented a simple calculator that is re-skinned using the
MOREPRIV API for each persona. For instance, when the top pro-
ﬁle is retiree, the calculator goes into a high contrast mode with large
text and buttons.
We highlight this example to show that MOREPRIV provides
an alternative to forcing complicated conﬁguration menus on users
who nonetheless prefer different conﬁgurations. An app like the
calculator could use proﬁle data to provide an initial conﬁguration
that is likely to be close to what the user wants, and allow her to
tweak conﬁguration options from there.
6.2 Personalization Case Study: Yelp
The goal of the rest of the section is to demonstrate that persona-
level personalization is useful and would be appreciated, were it
provided by the operating system natively. However, effective per-
sonalization is not an easy task.
It is both an art and a science,
requiring a combination of technical and design skills, deep under-
standing of the target market, and the particulars of the application.
Thus, we believe that a dedicated effort to create such a service
would have even better results.

Personalizing Yelp: For our personalization target, we have cho-
sen business recommendations using the Yelp API to get location-
aware reviews and listings for businesses such as restaurants, hair
salons, doctors, etc. popular in the US. The app includes a sub-
set of the Yelp categories at http://bit.ly/441TNj relevant to a
persona. When run, it pulls in a large number of Yelp listings, and
prioritizes those in categories relevant to the top proﬁle.
We have manually curated a list of 28 categories in the Yelp tax-
onomy (out of about 700) for business executive, intended to sug-
gest an activity that an executive might bring business associates
to. Categories fall into a more upscale niche, such as steakhouses,
wine bars, or auction houses. To personalize, we sort the full set
of Yelp results returned by reviewer rating “stars”. We then search
for a listing in a category relevant to the top persona not already
selected for display.
If there are no such listings, we select the
highest ranked remaining listing in a category relevant to the top
persona (even if we have already selected another listing in that
category). We note that there are many additional features upon
which to select listings, such as price, ambiance, availability of Wi-
Fi, etc. Our experiment does not use these features, as doing so
violates the Yelp API terms of use. Such restrictions could be ig-
nored by an ofﬁcial Yelp app. In a general sense, we assume that
the business executive persona applies at all times, which may not
always be valid [12].
Methodology: Using the Instant.ly crowd-sourcing platform, we
hired survey takers to answersix preference questions pertaining
to the following cities: Chicago, LA, Madison, NY, SF, and Seat-
tle. A sample survey can be seen at http://www.instant.ly/
s/B55pX. One question was asked for every city, phrased as fol-
lows:
We are trying to understand which listing is more relevant for
YOU. In other words, where are you more likely to go to and spend money
at? Which listing below do you ﬁnd more relevant and why?
Of course, any such survey measures expressed preferences, not
actual preferences, as noted in [36, 42]. However, short of deploy-
ing a modiﬁed app in the wild and watching users (who would have
to opt into the study), this is a good initial assessment.
Selecting users: Using the Instant.ly built-in crowd, we created
two survey groups general (21 respondents) and executive (41 re-
spondents). Executives were selected based on the following cri-
teria: age of 35–65, education of college graduate with a four-
year degree or an advanced degree, employed full-time or self-
employed, income in excess of $125,000, and married or living
with a partner. This is a fairly simplistic way to reach that demo-
graphic, but we believe it sufﬁces for our experiments. Given that
these listings are somewhat location-speciﬁc, we tried to avoid lo-
cation biases that might have been present in the recruiting process.
Results: Figure 4 presents the results of our study. We show pref-
erence for the executive treatment over the generic Yelp results for
the general user group and the executive user group, reﬂecting the
percentage of users who prefer the executive personalization. Over-
all, the boost, i.e. the difference in preference for executive in the
executive demographics vs.
the general population is most pro-
nounced for Los Angeles (43%) and San Francisco (18%). The
average boost across the cities is about 30%, which indicates that,
