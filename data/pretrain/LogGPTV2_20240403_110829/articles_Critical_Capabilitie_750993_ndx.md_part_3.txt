deployment of emerging technologies with cloud-native architectures, as well as
increasing the separation of responsibilities between core IT functions and developers.
Ultimately, the role responsible for developing and supporting software visibility and
instrumentation is a key element. This role also includes some elements of application
testing through the application life cycle. A key buying criterion of application developers
is method-level code visibility, including the ability to compare and profile code in
production environments. Problem isolation is another key capability that is often shared
with application support. Infrastructure visibility provides increased understanding of the
impact the code has on infrastructure elements.

DevOps and App/Dev use cases generally have the same APM and observability
requirements, although they are often distinct functions in an organization.
Application Owner/Line of Business
Application owners, LOB managers and those responsible for service delivery from a
nontechnical perspective are becoming interested in APM technologies.
These users formerly had been provided limited infrastructure metrics and health data
from IT operations organizations. However, because this information was not enough to
make business decisions, LOB buyers are driving APM suite tool purchases. The primary
focus of these users is on business metrics and customer journeys, but end-user
experience data is also important to detect trends before they manifest into something
that might harm the business.
SRE/Platform Operations
This provides a self-service development, deployment and operational platform that
enables multiple software delivery teams to build and operate their own products.
SRE enables cross-functional teams to design and operate scalable, resilient systems with
complex modern architectures, usually in cloud environments.
As development of cloud-native applications continues to increase, APM and observability
vendors have continued to evolve their support for applications built, using microservices,
packaged in containers and deployed across flexible, intelligent infrastructures. Typically,
the containers are orchestrated using Kubernetes. As such, the line between the
application and the intelligent infrastructure becomes blurred. This is especially true as
cloud-native applications are isolated or abstracted from server, OS and even traditional
network dependencies. These architectures are of enormous value to the business in
terms of cost and agility, and they present new challenges to monitoring tools, such as the
short lifetime of containers, which is often only seconds.
Most often, platform operations or SRE are the personas managing cloud-native
applications and responsible for their performance and availability. Their skills are a
combination of DevOps and traditional ITOps skills, and they work with cloud
management, infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring and observability tools, such as
those from these vendors.

Inclusion Criteria
Gartner’s Critical Capabilities research identifies and then analyzes the most relevant
providers and their products in a market. Gartner uses, by default, an upper limit of 20
providers to support the identification of the most relevant providers in a market. On some
specific occasions, the upper limit may be extended by Methodologies where the intended
research value to our clients might otherwise be diminished.
The inclusion criteria represent the specific attributes that analysts believe are necessary
for inclusion in this research.
To qualify for inclusion, providers must demonstrate the capability to observe an
application’s complete HTTP/S transaction behavior, either through proprietary agent
technology and/or distributed tracing. The vendor must demonstrate the capability to
automatically collect data from at least three modern application frameworks:
■ Java Virtual Machines (JVMs)
■ .NET CLRs
■ PHP
■ Ruby
■ Node.js
■ AngularJS

This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Python
■ Go
The vendor must show at least three of the following core capabilities:
■ Automated discovery and mapping of application and its infrastructure components
(including cloud services).
■ Monitoring of applications running on mobile (native and browser) and desktop
browser.
■ Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on
business outcomes.
■ Native integration capabilities with automation and service management tools, as
well as native integration with public cloud providers (for example, AWS Cloudwatch,
Azure Monitoring, Google Cloud Operations, etc.)
■ Analysis of business KPIs and user journeys (for example, login to check-out).
■ The ability to perform interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (that is,
traces, metrics, logs) to detect “unknown unknowns”; that is, the ability to identify
underlying issues to unexpected events.
■ Application security functionality, delivered via a common agent or framework for
APM.

Table 1: Weighting for Critical Capabilities in Use Cases
(Enlarged table in Appendix)
This methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of
products/services. Each capability is then weighted in terms of its relative importance for
specific product/service use cases.
Critical Capabilities Rating
Each of the products/services has been evaluated on the critical capabilities on a scale of
1 to 5. A score of 1 equals Poor (most or all defined requirements are not achieved), while
5 equals Outstanding (significantly exceeds requirements). However, readers are
cautioned not to compare scores of the 2021 APM critical capabilities ratings with those
in the prior version (see Critical Capabilities for Application Performance Monitoring),
because the evaluation process has been updated.
In the prior evaluation, Gartner developed persona-based scenario elements against which
vendors were asked to demonstrate their product and/or service capabilities. Thus, if the
score in the current research is either higher or lower than in the prior version, you should
not conclude that the vendor’s offering in some way performed better or worse than last
year.

Table 2: Product/Service Rating on Critical Capabilities
(Enlarged table in Appendix)
Table 3 shows the product/service scores for each use case. The scores, which are
generated by multiplying the use-case weightings by the product/service ratings,
summarize how well the critical capabilities are met for each use case.

Table 3: Product Score in Use Cases
(Enlarged table in Appendix)
To determine an overall score for each product/service in the use cases, multiply the
ratings in Table 2 by the weightings shown in Table 1.
Critical Capabilities Methodology
This methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of
products or services. Each capability is then weighted in terms of its relative importance
for specific product or service use cases. Next, products/services are rated in terms of how
well they achieve each of the critical capabilities. A score that summarizes how well they
meet the critical capabilities for each use case is then calculated for each product/service.
"Critical capabilities" are attributes that differentiate products/services in a class in terms
of their quality and performance. Gartner recommends that users consider the set of
critical capabilities as some of the most important criteria for acquisition decisions.

This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
In defining the product/service category for evaluation, the analyst first identifies the
leading uses for the products/services in this market. What needs are end-users looking to
fulfill, when considering products/services in this market? Use cases should match
common client deployment scenarios. These distinct client scenarios define the Use
Cases.
The analyst then identifies the critical capabilities. These capabilities are generalized
groups of features commonly required by this class of products/services. Each capability
is assigned a level of importance in fulfilling that particular need; some sets of features
are more important than others, depending on the use case being evaluated.
Each vendor’s product or service is evaluated in terms of how well it delivers each
capability, on a five-point scale. These ratings are displayed side-by-side for all vendors,
allowing easy comparisons between the different sets of features.
Ratings and summary scores range from 1.0 to 5.0:
1 = Poor or Absent: most or all defined requirements for a capability are not achieved
2 = Fair: some requirements are not achieved
3 = Good: meets requirements
4 = Excellent: meets or exceeds some requirements
5 = Outstanding: significantly exceeds requirements
To determine an overall score for each product in the use cases, the product ratings are
multiplied by the weightings to come up with the product score in use cases.
The critical capabilities Gartner has selected do not represent all capabilities for any
product; therefore, may not represent those most important for a specific use situation or
business objective. Clients should use a critical capabilities analysis as one of several
sources of input about a product before making a product/service decision.
