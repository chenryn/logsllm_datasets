### Deployment of Emerging Technologies with Cloud-Native Architectures

The deployment of emerging technologies with cloud-native architectures, as well as the increasing separation of responsibilities between core IT functions and developers, is a key trend in modern software development. The role responsible for developing and supporting software visibility and instrumentation is crucial. This role also includes aspects of application testing throughout the application lifecycle. A critical requirement for application developers is method-level code visibility, including the ability to compare and profile code in production environments. Problem isolation, often shared with application support, is another essential capability. Infrastructure visibility provides a deeper understanding of the impact that code has on infrastructure elements.

### DevOps and App/Dev Use Cases

DevOps and App/Dev use cases generally have the same Application Performance Management (APM) and observability requirements, although they are often distinct functions within an organization.

### Application Owner/Line of Business

Application owners, Line of Business (LOB) managers, and those responsible for service delivery from a non-technical perspective are increasingly interested in APM technologies. Historically, these users were provided with limited infrastructure metrics and health data from IT operations organizations. However, this information was insufficient for making business decisions. As a result, LOB buyers are now driving the purchase of APM suite tools. Their primary focus is on business metrics and customer journeys, but end-user experience data is also important for detecting trends before they become problematic.

### SRE/Platform Operations

SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) provides a self-service development, deployment, and operational platform that enables multiple software delivery teams to build and operate their own products. SRE enables cross-functional teams to design and operate scalable, resilient systems with complex modern architectures, typically in cloud environments.

As the development of cloud-native applications continues to grow, APM and observability vendors are evolving their support for applications built using microservices, packaged in containers, and deployed across flexible, intelligent infrastructures. Typically, these containers are orchestrated using Kubernetes. This blurs the line between the application and the intelligent infrastructure, especially as cloud-native applications are isolated or abstracted from server, OS, and even traditional network dependencies. These architectures offer significant value to businesses in terms of cost and agility but present new challenges to monitoring tools, such as the short lifetime of containers, which can be just seconds.

Platform operations or SRE are usually the personas managing cloud-native applications and responsible for their performance and availability. Their skills combine DevOps and traditional ITOps, and they work with cloud management, infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring and observability tools from various vendors.

### Vendors Added and Dropped

**Added:**
- Amazon Web Services
- Honeycomb
- Logz.io
- SumoLogic
- VMware (TO)

**Dropped:**
- Tingyun did not meet the inclusion criteria.

### Inclusion Criteria

Gartner’s Critical Capabilities research identifies and analyzes the most relevant providers and their products in a market. By default, Gartner uses an upper limit of 20 providers to identify the most relevant providers in a market. On specific occasions, the upper limit may be extended if the intended research value to clients might otherwise be diminished.

To qualify for inclusion, providers must demonstrate the capability to observe an application’s complete HTTP/S transaction behavior, either through proprietary agent technology and/or distributed tracing. The vendor must also demonstrate the capability to automatically collect data from at least three modern application frameworks, such as:
- Java Virtual Machines (JVMs)
- .NET CLRs
- PHP
- Ruby
- Node.js
- AngularJS
- Python
- Go

The vendor must show at least three of the following core capabilities:
- Automated discovery and mapping of application and its infrastructure components (including cloud services).
- Monitoring of applications running on mobile (native and browser) and desktop browsers.
- Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on business outcomes.
- Native integration capabilities with automation and service management tools, as well as native integration with public cloud providers (e.g., AWS Cloudwatch, Azure Monitoring, Google Cloud Operations).
- Analysis of business KPIs and user journeys (e.g., login to check-out).
- The ability to perform interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (traces, metrics, logs) to detect "unknown unknowns" and identify underlying issues to unexpected events.
- Application security functionality, delivered via a common agent or framework for APM.

### Table 1: Weighting for Critical Capabilities in Use Cases

(Enlarged table in Appendix)

This methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of products/services. Each capability is then weighted in terms of its relative importance for specific product/service use cases.

### Critical Capabilities Rating

Each of the products/services has been evaluated on the critical capabilities on a scale of 1 to 5. A score of 1 equals Poor (most or all defined requirements are not achieved), while 5 equals Outstanding (significantly exceeds requirements). Readers should not compare scores of the 2021 APM critical capabilities ratings with those in the prior version, as the evaluation process has been updated.

In the prior evaluation, Gartner developed persona-based scenario elements against which vendors were asked to demonstrate their product and/or service capabilities. Thus, if the score in the current research is either higher or lower than in the prior version, it does not necessarily mean the vendor’s offering performed better or worse than last year.

### Table 2: Product/Service Rating on Critical Capabilities

(Enlarged table in Appendix)

Table 3 shows the product/service scores for each use case. The scores, generated by multiplying the use-case weightings by the product/service ratings, summarize how well the critical capabilities are met for each use case.

### Table 3: Product Score in Use Cases

(Enlarged table in Appendix)

To determine an overall score for each product/service in the use cases, multiply the ratings in Table 2 by the weightings shown in Table 1.

### Critical Capabilities Methodology

This methodology requires analysts to identify the critical capabilities for a class of products or services. Each capability is then weighted in terms of its relative importance for specific product or service use cases. Next, products/services are rated in terms of how well they achieve each of the critical capabilities. A score that summarizes how well they meet the critical capabilities for each use case is then calculated for each product/service.

"Critical capabilities" are attributes that differentiate products/services in a class in terms of their quality and performance. Gartner recommends that users consider the set of critical capabilities as some of the most important criteria for acquisition decisions.

### Defining the Product/Service Category for Evaluation

The analyst first identifies the leading uses for the products/services in this market. What needs are end-users looking to fulfill when considering products/services in this market? Use cases should match common client deployment scenarios. These distinct client scenarios define the Use Cases.

The analyst then identifies the critical capabilities. These capabilities are generalized groups of features commonly required by this class of products/services. Each capability is assigned a level of importance in fulfilling that particular need; some sets of features are more important than others, depending on the use case being evaluated.

Each vendor’s product or service is evaluated in terms of how well it delivers each capability, on a five-point scale. These ratings are displayed side-by-side for all vendors, allowing easy comparisons between the different sets of features.

Ratings and summary scores range from 1.0 to 5.0:
- 1 = Poor or Absent: Most or all defined requirements for a capability are not achieved.
- 2 = Fair: Some requirements are not achieved.
- 3 = Good: Meets requirements.
- 4 = Excellent: Meets or exceeds some requirements.
- 5 = Outstanding: Significantly exceeds requirements.

To determine an overall score for each product in the use cases, the product ratings are multiplied by the weightings to come up with the product score in use cases.

The critical capabilities Gartner has selected do not represent all capabilities for any product; therefore, they may not represent those most important for a specific use situation or business objective. Clients should use a critical capabilities analysis as one of several sources of input about a product before making a product/service decision.
