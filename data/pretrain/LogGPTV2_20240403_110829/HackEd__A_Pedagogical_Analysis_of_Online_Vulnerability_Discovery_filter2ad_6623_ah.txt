B. Analysis Review
Moving on to our review of your exercise, now I’ll go
through each core pedagogical principle and its dimensions.
For each, I will give you our deﬁnition and our decision and
then get your response.
For each core principle and related dimension, we provided
the interviewee with the textual deﬁnitions given throughout
Section III
For each dimension coded No or Partial, we explained the
reasoning behind our decision and asked the following question
progression:
1) Do you agree?
a) If no: Why not?
b) If yes: Do you agree that this pedagogical dimension
would be helpful to students if implemented?
i) If no: Why not?
ii) If yes: Why did you choose not to implement it?
A) If they said it was too difﬁcult: What are the
challenges?
APPENDIX B
CODEBOOK
In this appendix, we provide the codebook used to categorize
organizer decisions for not fully implementing reviewed
pedagogical principles.
• Does not ﬁt our goals: The organizer considered imple-
menting the dimension, but chose not to because it did not
ﬁt within the structure and intended goals of the exercise.
• Challenging: The organizers considered implementing
the dimension, but decided that implementation would be
