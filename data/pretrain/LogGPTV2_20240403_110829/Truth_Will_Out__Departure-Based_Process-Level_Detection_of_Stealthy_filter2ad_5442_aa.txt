**Abstract:**
Recent incidents have shown that Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated and targeted attacks by highly motivated, knowledgeable, and well-resourced adversaries. While traditional security mechanisms can be implemented at the IT-infrastructure level, it is essential to monitor process-level activity as well, since attacks on ICS can significantly impact the physical process. In this paper, we introduce PASAD, a novel stealthy-attack detection mechanism that monitors sensor measurements in real time for structural changes in process behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and experiments on data from real systems. Our results show that PASAD can detect not only significant deviations but also subtle attack-indicating changes, raising the bar for strategic adversaries who may attempt to maintain their malicious manipulation within the noise level.

## 1. Introduction

Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are critical components of infrastructure such as transportation, aerospace, electricity grids, nuclear plants, and gas distribution systems. Unlike traditional IT systems, which primarily manage data, ICS control physical processes. The need to secure these cyber-physical systems is paramount, as cyber attacks can cause irreparable physical damage, environmental disasters, and severe disruptions to societal functioning. Recent incidents, including Stuxnet, the German steel-mill attack, and the Maroochy water breach, highlight the increasing vulnerability of ICS to targeted attacks by skilled adversaries.

Due to the high stakes involved, ICS are becoming attractive targets for cyber criminals. This has led to the development of ICS-specific malware and sophisticated attacks, such as the Dragonfly malware, PLC-Blaster worm, Ladder Logic Bombs, and PLC Pin Control attack. As ICS adopt more standard IT solutions, they become less isolated and more vulnerable to new types of threats. According to a 2017 SANS survey, 69% of security practitioners perceive the current cyber-threat level in ICS as critical or high, a 26% increase from two years prior.

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) are ill-suited for ICS because they do not account for process semantics. Researchers are increasingly focusing on developing techniques that can detect sophisticated attacks at the process level. These systems monitor sensors and control commands to detect deviations from normal behavior. One common approach is to build a Linear Dynamical State-Space (LDS) model of the physical process, but this requires significant human effort and detailed knowledge of the system, which is often unavailable.

In this paper, we propose PASAD, a specification-agnostic, data-driven, and model-free Process-Aware Stealthy-Attack Detection mechanism. PASAD monitors sensor readings in real time and raises an alarm when a structural change in the process behavior is detected. We compare PASAD with existing methods, such as Auto-Regressive (AR) models, and show that PASAD performs better, especially in detecting subtle changes. We validate our approach using the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process control model, the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) plant, and network traffic from a real ICS.

**Contributions:**
1. We present a novel technique for process-level detection of stealthy attacks on control systems, capable of detecting strategic attackers who camouflage malicious changes with noise.
2. We introduce the concept of "departure" as a specific type of anomaly, where a process regulated by a control system deviates from its normal state due to a structural change. We develop an efficient algorithm to detect this departure.
3. We create and publicly release new, carefully crafted attacks ranging from easily detectable to highly stealthy, and explore their impact on the TE process.
4. We validate our approach through extensive experiments using a simulation platform, data from a physical testbed, and real ICS network traffic. We compare PASAD with a popular existing method and show superior performance.

In Section 2, we describe PASAD in detail, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. In Section 3, we establish a framework for validating our approach. Section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results. Section 5 reviews related literature, and Section 6 concludes the paper.

## 2. PASAD: Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection

PASAD is an anomaly-based process-level intrusion detection system that monitors ICS process activity in real time to determine whether the system operation is normal or anomalous. Initially, PASAD learns the normal behavior recorded in a time series of sensor measurements during normal process operation. It then actively checks whether current observations are departing from historical normal behavior. To extract signal information, PASAD uses ideas from Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), a non-parametric exploratory tool for time series that separates the deterministic part of a dynamical system from the chaotic part, purely from noisy measurements.

Once signal information is extracted, PASAD identifies a signal subspace that describes the deterministic variability in the time series produced by the process during normal activity. The most recent observations are projected onto this subspace, and a departure score is computed for each new observation. A persistent increase in the score suggests that current observations are not in accordance with the estimated dynamics, indicating a potential malicious change in the process.

Our method is based on a rich and sound theory and has a low computational overhead. A key component is the "isometry trick," a mathematical property that reduces the computations needed to evaluate the departure score and allows for visual validation of the underlying theory. We dedicate Section 2.6 to explaining and proving this fundamental property.
