ABSTRACT
Recent incidents have shown that Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
are becoming increasingly susceptible to sophisticated and tar-
geted attacks initiated by adversaries with high motivation, domain
knowledge, and resources. Although traditional security mecha-
nisms can be implemented at the IT-infrastructure level of such
cyber-physical systems, the community has acknowledged that it
is imperative to also monitor the process-level activity, as attacks
on ICS may very well influence the physical process. In this paper,
we present pasad, a novel stealthy-attack detection mechanism
that monitors time series of sensor measurements in real time for
structural changes in the process behavior. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through simulations and experiments
on data from real systems. Experimental results show that pasad is
capable of detecting not only significant deviations in the process
behavior, but also subtle attack-indicating changes, significantly
raising the bar for strategic adversaries who may attempt to main-
tain their malicious manipulation within the noise level.

1 INTRODUCTION
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are often found in critical infras-
tructures, such as transportation, aerospace, electricity grids, nu-
clear plants, and gas distribution systems to name a few. Unlike
traditional IT systems, which mainly manage data, ICS control
physical processes. The need to secure these critical cyber-physical

systems cannot be overemphasized as the impact of cyber attacks
is no longer bounded by financial losses due to some service dis-
ruption or loss of data. Cyber attacks on control systems can cause
irreparable physical damage to equipment in safety-critical facili-
ties, raw sewage to spill out into local parks and rivers, large-scale
power blackouts, and severe damage to a nation’s critical assets on
which normal societal functioning depends. In recent years, sev-
eral incidents have been reported indicating that ICS are becoming
increasingly exposed to targeted attacks, allegedly initiated by ad-
versaries with enough skills and resources to circumvent security
measures at the IT-infrastructure level and trigger unwanted behav-
iors in the underlying physical process. Stuxnet [10, 14], the German
steel-mill attack [33], the Maroochy water breach [2], Triton [25],
and the growing number of attacks on energy networks [34, 53] are
just a few cases in point. This issue is even being addressed in high-
level forums such as in the 2018 World Economic Forum meeting in
Davos, where concerns have been raised about the consequences
of successful attacks on water supply or nuclear power stations,
which have potential to claim many lives and throw communities
into chaos [3].
Due to the high rewards that the attacks on ICS can realize, these
systems are becoming attractive targets for cyber criminals. Con-
sequently, ICS-specific malware and targeted attacks are growing
both in diversity and sophistication. In addition to the prominent
Stuxnet worm, other pieces of malware designed specifically for
ICS, such as the Dragonfly malware [41], and attacks specifically
targeting Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), including the
PLC-Blaster worm [47], the Ladder Logic Bombs [20], and the PLC
Pin Control attack [1] have started to surface.
Evolving from isolated systems running proprietary control pro-
tocols using specialized hardware and software, ICS are increas-
ingly adopting IT solutions by using industry-standard network
protocols and operating systems to promote corporate connectiv-
ity and meet performance requirements [48]. The integration of
standard IT-based solutions is making these systems considerably
less isolated from the outside world, and introducing a host of new
vulnerabilities inherited from the IT sector. According to a 2017
SANS survey [21], 69% of security practitioners perceive the cur-
rent cyber-threat level in ICS as critical or high, a whooping 26%
increase from just two years before.
One fundamental difference between traditional IT-based sys-
tems and industrial control systems is that the latter interact with
the physical world. Conventional off-the-shelf intrusion detection
systems prove ill-fit for the ICS domain because they do not take
process semantics into account [22]. Reportedly, in the latest attack
on the power grid in Ukraine, hackers are thought to have hidden,
undetected for six months, in the energy company’s IT network,

where researchers have shown growing interest in developing tech-
niques that can detect such sophisticated attacks at the process
level [8, 9, 22, 28, 31, 35, 46, 50, 51]. Although intruders may be able
to hide in the IT network while figuring out their workings, the
main driver of this trend is the observation that they can hardly hide
their final goal, which is to cause an adverse effect on the physical
process by maliciously manipulating sensor and control data [8].
A process-level intrusion detection system monitors sensors—the
eyes and ears of control systems—and possibly control commands,
to determine if the physical process is drifting from the normal or
expected behavior. One popular approach frequently used in this
domain proposes to build a Linear Dynamical State-Space (LDS)
model of the physical process, through what is known as system
identification (see [51] and references therein), which is subse-
quently used to detect anomalies in the system behavior. Although
such approaches might detect anomalous behaviors, models are
difficult to build, requiring massive human effort at the preliminary
stage [15], and a complete and highly detailed model of the physical
process that is not always available [28].
In this paper, we propose a specification-agnostic approach that is
purely data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the system
dynamics. We present pasad, a light-weight and fast model-free
Process-Aware Stealthy-Attack Detection mechanism that monitors
sensors in ICS in real time and raises an alarm whenever a structural
change in the behavior of the physical process is suspected.
A data-driven approach has also been proposed in [22], where his-
torical sensor readings are used to fit a linear Auto-Regressive (AR)
model, which is then used to detect deviations from what the model
expects. We argue that attempting to fit a simple linear model to
a time series of noisy sensor measurements may often yield inac-
curate detection results when the changes in the time series are
subtle. In §4.4, we present a comparison between AR and pasad
and show that our method performs better.
acquiring privileges to access systems before taking methodical
steps to take the power offline [44]. In the attack on the Iranian
nuclear plant, the Stuxnet worm used zero-day exploits to infect
systems while hiding its changes using sophisticated rootkits and
validating its drivers with stolen trusted certificates [8, 14]. The
fundamentally different nature of these systems calls for security
approaches that are tailored to the ICS environment.
Most of the existing approaches use prediction-based methods
where a predicted value ˆyk of the sensor reading yk at time k is
computed, and the difference rk = | ˆyk − yk| is checked against a
threshold θ such that if rk ≥ θ, an alarm is raised. Instead of pre-
dicting the future, pasad seeks to solve the easier problem of deciding
whether present sensor readings are departing from past readings due
to a change in the mechanism generating them. We review related
literature in more detail in §5.
In addition to the aforementioned benefits, what we consider the
chief advantage of our approach over existing methods is the fact
that pasad is capable of detecting slight variations in the sensor
signal, owing to its impressive noise-reduction capabilities. This
leads to the possibility of detecting strategic attackers who may try to
hide their attacks even at the process level, by injecting just enough
false data that the compromised sensor values remain roughly
within the noise level. Such stealthy integrity attacks are hard
to detect by failure detectors or anomaly detectors that are not
insensitive to noise. Mo and Sinopoli [38] argue that a strategic
adversary may inject an attack that inflicts a large perturbation on
the system state while only causing a slight increase in the detection
rate of these detectors. We further motivate our approach in §2.1.
Pasad initially extracts noise-reduced signal information from a
time series of sensor measurements during normal process opera-
tion and then actively checks whether present realizations of the
process are departing from historical normal behavior. To extract
signal information, pasad borrows ideas from Singular Spectrum
Analysis (SSA) [7, 13, 17–19, 23, 52], a non-parametric exploratory
analysis tool for time series that is particularly suitable for separat-
ing the deterministic part of a dynamical system behavior from the
chaotic part, purely from noisy time series of measurements.
Once signal information has been extracted, pasad proceeds
by identifying a signal subspace that describes the deterministic
variability in the time series produced by the process during normal
activity. Afterwards, the most recent observations (lagged vectors
thereof) are projected onto this subspace and a departure score is
computed for every new observation. A persistent increase in the
computed score suggests that current observations are not in accor-
dance with the estimated dynamics, and that a malicious change in
the mechanism generating the time series may be occurring.
Our method is based on a rich and sound theory and at the same
time enjoys a low computational overhead. A key ingredient to
this desired combination is a direct result of what we refer to as
the isometry trick. The trick is based on a mathematical property
and has two added benefits for pasad: one pertaining to efficiency,
where the computations needed to evaluate the departure score are
reduced significantly; and another pertaining to validation, where
one can visualize the time-series data in the signal subspace, which
helps validating the underlying theory. We dedicate §2.6 to explain-
ing and proving this fundamental property.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of pasad using the Tennessee-
Eastman (TE) process control model under various attack scenarios.
While it is shown how direct attacks that aim to sabotage the con-
trol system by forcing controllers to operate outside their specified
boundaries can be trivially detected, we demonstrate how stealthy
integrity attacks, which are designed to cause tangible impact in a
stealthy manner, may as well be detected in reasonable time. Fur-
thermore, we test pasad using data from the Secure Water Treat-
ment (SWaT) plant—a physical testbed dedicated for ICS security
research—and on data from a relatively long network trace captured
from an operational water distribution plant in Sweden, to investi-
gate its applicability to real industrial settings. Finally, we compare
our method with an enhanced version of the AR method proposed
in [22], and demonstrate how, in contrast to simple linear mod-
els like AR, pasad is capable of detecting subtle attack-indicating
changes in the process behavior.
More specifically, our contributions in this paper are the follow-
ing: (i) We present a novel technique for process-level detection
of stealthy attacks on control systems that is capable of detect-
ing strategic attackers who may attempt to camouflage malicious
changes with noise. We provide theoretical arguments and empir-
ical results validating our principled approach; (ii) we introduce
the notion of departure as a specific type of anomaly, whereby a
process regulated by some control system departs from the normal
Session 5A: CyberphysicalCCS’18, October 15-19, 2018, Toronto, ON, Canada818state due to a structural change in the process behavior. We devise
an algorithm that detects this departure accurately and efficiently;
(iii) we create new carefully crafted attacks ranging from easy to
detect to fairly stealthy, explore their impact on the TE process, and
make the attack data publicly available; and (iv) we validate our
approach by conducting extensive experiments using a simulation
platform, data from a physical testbed, and network traffic from
a real ICS. Moreover, we compare pasad with a popular existing
method and show that the results are in favor of our approach.
In §2, we describe pasad in detail, treating both its theoretical
and practical aspects. We establish a framework for validating our
approach in §3. Then, we describe and discuss the experiments and
the results thereof in §4. In §5, we review related literature, and
finally, we conclude this work in §6.
