User:  Please describe what is a Restful API and give some design principles.
Assistant: The Restful style API is a web service design style based on the HTTP protocol. Its main feature is to regard all resources as URL addresses and use the HTTP protocol for data interaction. It is concise, clear, easy to understand and use. . The design principles of Restful API include: 1. Each resource has a unique URL address; 2. Use HTTP methods to indicate different operations on resources; 3. Use HTTP status codes to feedback the results of resource operations; 4. Support Multiple representations of resources, such as JSON, XML, etc.; 5. Following the principle of statelessness, all requests contain the information it needs. By following these principles, an API with good readability, maintainability and scalability can be designed, which is convenient for clients to operate and develop. At the same time, the Restful API can also provide efficient, safe, and reliable services, helping to improve the client experience.
