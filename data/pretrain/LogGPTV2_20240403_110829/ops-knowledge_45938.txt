User: Lets assume a python code written and tested on linux system with python 2.7.1. It utilizes only the default python libraries like: os, itertools, tkinter, csv, collections.
If we take this code and put into a python 2.7.1 on a windows system, will it work fine?
Assistant: The Python bytecode itself is not platform-dependent, assuming a full Python VM implementation.
There are specific modules and functions that are only available on certain platforms, therefore Python source code can be made platform-dependent if it uses these. The documentation specifies if a name is only available on a restricted subset of platforms, so avoiding these will go far to make it platform-independent.
