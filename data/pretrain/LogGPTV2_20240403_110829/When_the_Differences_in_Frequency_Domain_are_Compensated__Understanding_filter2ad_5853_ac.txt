In this section, we propose a countermeasure called DualGuard against
the modulated replay attack. Due to the similarity of the amplitude
spectrum between the modulated replay signals and the genuine
signals, the defense will be conducted not only in the frequency
domain, but also in the time domain.
4.1 Defense Overview
In our scheme, our countermeasure contains two inseparable parts:
frequency-domain defense and time-domain defense. A voice com-
mand must pass both defenses in time and frequency domains
before it can be accepted by ASR systems.
The frequency-domain defense is proved to be effective against
classical replay attacks. Because of the frequency spectrum dis-
tortion caused by the replay process, we use the power spectrum
distribution (timbre) to distinguish the classical replay audio. The
area under the CDF curve (AUC) of the power spectrum distribution
is extracted as the key frequency-domain feature. We find that the
AUC value of the genuine audio is statistically larger than that of
the replay audio. By utilizing the frequency-domain defense, we
filter out the threat from the classical replay attacks.
The modulated replay audio has the same amplitude spectrum as
the genuine audio. Hence, we need to detect the modulated replay
audio in other domains. In the phase domain, there is no useful
information in the phase spectrum, which records the starting
points of each frequency component in the time axis. But in the time
domain, we discover and formally prove the following theorem.
Theorem. There are inevitably spurious oscillations (ringing arti-
facts) in the modulated replay audio. The amplitude of the ringing
artifacts is restricted by the signal amplitude spectrum and absolute
phase shifts.
The mathematical proof of the theorem is demonstrated in Ap-
pendix A. In the time domain, based on this theorem, there are
small ringing artifacts in the modulated replay signals. However,

is statistically smooth.
We define a new metric called local extrema ratio to quantita-
tively describe the strengths of the ringing artifacts. We utilize local
extrema ratios at different granularity as the key time-domain fea-
ture and filter out modulated replay attacks using an SVM classifier.
4.2 Time-domain Defense
Because of the difficulty in detecting the modulated replay audio
via frequency and phase features, we seek the defenses in the time
domain. By our observations and mathematical proof (see Appen-
dix A), we find there are small ringing artifacts in the time-domain
signals when performing the modulated replay attack. Although
these time-domain artifacts correspond to the high-frequency com-
ponents, the power of the artifact is too small to be detected in the
frequency domain because the maximum amplitude is constraint
by the Equation (11). In the frequency domain, the ringing artifacts
can be easily mistaken for the ambient noise. Hence, we propose
a time-domain defense method that utilizes the pattern of small
ringing artifacts in the modulated replay audio.
The ringing artifacts pattern is a robust feature that cannot be
further compensated by a higher-order filter. The ringing artifacts
are caused by the physical property, but not the modulated process
itself. When we modulate the recorded audio, there are no ringing
artifacts in the processed audio. The ringing artifacts only occur
after replaying the processed audio, thus becoming an inevitable
feature in the modulated replay audio. In order to describe the
ringing artifacts in the time-domain signals, we take local extreme
ratio as the metric. We firstly give a definition of local extrema.
Definition: In a signal segment 𝑦, if a sampling point 𝑦𝑖 is the
maximum value or the minimum value in the (2𝑟+1)-length window
[𝑦𝑖−𝑟 , 𝑦𝑖+𝑟], 𝑦𝑖 is a local extrema in the time-domain signal. Note
that if the index of the window element is out of bounds, we will
pad the window with the nearest effective element.
Local extrema ratio (LER) is defined as the ratio of the local
extrema amount to the total signal length. Given an input signal
segment, the local extrema ratio correlates with the window pa-
rameter 𝑟. When the window size is small, the LER calculation is
in fine granularity that reflects the small ringing artifacts in the
time-domain signals. When the window size is large, LER shows the
overall change trend of the signals. The modulated replay signals
and the genuine signals have different patterns in local extrema
ratio with different granularity. We can detect the modulated replay
attack via identifying the LER patterns with different parameter
𝑟 ∈ [1, 𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑥]. Algorithm 1 shows the function of obtaining the local
extrema patterns and detecting the modulated replay audio.

the number of local extrema does not differ much between modu-
lated replay audio and genuine audio. However, in Figure 5(b), the
situation would be different under the fine granularity (smaller win-
dow size). Due to the ringing artifacts, small spurious oscillations
occur in modulated replay audio. The number of local extrema in
modulated replay audio will be significantly larger than that in
genuine audio, which becomes a critical feature that helps us de-
tect the modulated replay attack. A Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier is trained to distinguish modulated replay audio by deter-
mining the local extrema pattern (LEP) with different granularity.
The time-domain attack detection is shown in Algorithm 1. The
audio will become the candidate audio for the frequency-domain
checking if it does not come from the modulated replay attack.

4.3 Frequency-domain Defense
The frequency-domain defense is used to counter the classic replay
attack. It is based on the noticeable different timbre of the voice
sounded from human and electronic speakers.
In the replay model, each component frequency in the genuine
audio is exactly the same as that in the replay audio, no matter
the fundamental frequency or the harmonics. For example, if the
fundamental frequency of the genuine audio is 500 Hz, the replay
audio will also have a fundamental frequency of 500 Hz. However,
even with the same component frequencies, the genuine human
voice and the replay voice sound different in our perception. The
main reason is the power distributions of the frequency components,
namely the timbre, are different.
For human, our voice is sounded from the phonatory organ. The
typical sound frequency for human is within the range from 85 Hz
to 4 kHz, where the low-frequency components are dominant. For
electronic speakers, there is an acoustic defect on the low-frequency
components due to the speaker structure, materials, and the limited

tribution for genuine and direct replay audios.
size. The power of the replay signals decays dramatically in the low-
frequency range, especially under 500 Hz. Meanwhile, the human
fundamental frequency range is 64-523 Hz for men, and 160-1200
Hz for women. Hence, the electronic speakers will attenuate the
power in the human fundamental frequency because of the speaker
properties. With respect to the power distribution, the power of
the genuine audio is mainly concentrated in the low-frequency
range, while the power of the replay audio is more distributed in
the speech frequency range. Our frequency-domain defense utilizes
these timbre features to defeat the classic replay attack.

Timbre is described by the power distribution of different fre-
quency components. It is necessary to define a mathematical de-
scription for the timbre. When an ASR system captures a voice
signal from the air with a sampling rate of 𝑓𝑠, we firstly obtain
the amplitude spectrum of the signal through 𝑁 -point fast Fourier
transform. The signal amplitude spectrum is denoted as 𝐾(𝑛), 𝑛 =
0, ..., 𝑁 − 1, with the frequency resolution Δ𝑓 = 𝑓𝑠/𝑁 . The fre-
quency value of the 𝑖-th component is 𝑖 · Δ𝑓 , while the ampli-
tude is 𝐾(𝑖). Hence, the signal power spectrum is 𝐾2(𝑛), and the

𝐴(𝑛) is a monotonically increasing function, with a range of
[0, 1]. As shown in Figure 6, the power spectrum CDF of genuine
audios and replay audios are quite different. For genuine audios, the
power is concentrated in the low-frequency range, so the CDF rises
more quickly. For replay audios, the CDF function grows slower
due to the more distributed power spectrum. We utilize the CDF
characteristic to distinguish replay audios from genuine audios.

We utilize the area under the CDF curve (AUC) to verify and
If the AUC value is less than a specific threshold 𝐴𝑇 𝐻 ∈ (0, 1), there
is a classic replay attack. We show the frequency-domain attack
detection in Algorithm 2.
4.4 Security Analysis
We discover and prove that there are inevitably either ringing arti-
facts in the time domain or spectrum distortion in the frequency
domain, no matter if replay signals are modulated.
For the frequency-domain defense, the principle comes from the
signal difference of the power spectrum distributions. It is known
that human speech is not a single-frequency signal, but a signal with
fundamental frequency 𝑓 and several harmonics 𝑛𝑓 , 𝑛 ≥ 2. Within
the human voice frequency range, the speaker response has a great
difference in the low-frequency band and the high-frequency band,
which means 𝐻(𝑓 ) ≠ 𝐻(𝑛𝑓 ). As a result, the power ratio of genuine
audio 𝐴(𝑓 )/𝐴(𝑛𝑓 ) is different from that of the corresponding replay
audio (𝐻(𝑓 ) · 𝐴(𝑓 ))/(𝐻(𝑛𝑓 ) · 𝐴(𝑛𝑓 )). The different power ratios
cause the difference in the power spectrum distributions.
For the time-domain defense, we can prove that there are in-
evitably spurious oscillations (ringing artifacts) in the modulated
replay audio. The critical factor is the inevitable phase shifts that
cannot be accurately measured (see details in Appendix A). Al-
though the amplitude spectrums are the same, the signal phase
spectrums can be different. The relationship between the amplitude
spectrum to the time-domain signals is a one-to-many relationship.
Moreover, we cannot compensate for the phase shifts due to the
limits of the accuracy in measurements. Even a small phase error
can cause ringing artifacts in the time-domain. That is why we need
to check the signals in both frequency domain and time domain.
Besides, the high local extrema ratio in the modulated replay
audio can result from other aspects, i.e. the measurement error, the
