### reg export

The `reg export` command allows you to copy specified subkeys, entries, and values from the local computer's registry into a file, which can then be transferred to other servers.

#### Syntax
```
reg export <keyname> <filename> [/y]
```

#### Parameters

- **<keyname>**: Specifies the full path of the subkey. The export operation is only applicable to the local computer. The key name must include a valid root key. Valid root keys for the local computer are: `HKLM`, `HKCU`, `HKCR`, `HKU`, and `HKCC`. If the registry key name contains spaces, enclose the key name in double quotes.
  
- **<filename>**: Specifies the name and path of the file to be created during the operation. The file must have a `.reg` extension.

- **/y**: Overwrites any existing file with the specified filename without prompting for confirmation.

- **/?**: Displays help information at the command prompt.

#### Return Values

- **0**: Success
- **1**: Failure

#### Examples

To export the contents of all subkeys and values of the key `MyApp` to the file `AppBkUp.reg`, type:
```
reg export HKLM\Software\MyCo\MyApp AppBkUp.reg
```

This command will create a `.reg` file named `AppBkUp.reg` containing the specified registry key and its subkeys, which can be used to transfer or back up the registry settings.
