User: In the MySQL database, how to use the JOIN operation to merge the data of two tables?
Assistant: You can use the following SQL statement to merge the data of two tables using the JOIN operation: ``` SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column; ``` where table1 and table2 are the two tables to be merged The name of the table, column is the common column name in the two tables, which can be any column, and is used to establish the relationship between the two tables. The specific explanation is as follows: - JOIN operation is the operation of merging the data in the two tables that meet the association conditions. - SELECT * means to select all columns, and you can also specify the selected column name. - table1 and table2 are the names of the two tables to be merged. - The ON clause is used to specify the association condition for connecting the two tables, that is, the key value for connecting the two tables. The JOIN operation needs to specify the connection condition in order to determine the merged data. For example, the following is an example of a JOIN operation: ``` SELECT * FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id; ``` In this example, customers and orders are two tables to be merged, and they both have a A column named customer_id. The join condition is specified in the ON clause, that is, when the customer_id column in the customers table is equal to the customer_id column in the orders table, the data in the two tables will be merged.
