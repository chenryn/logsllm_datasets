companies like Amazon, SoftLayer Technologies, and Send-
Grid were added by a large number of domains. All these
domains would be the perfect target for an attacker as she
would be able to pass the SPF validation of a large number of
domains if she gets access to a single system that is listed in
the SPF record. On the other hand, we observed that a small
number of domains trusts a variety of IP addresses from up
to 9,000 different ASes. This implies that some individual do-
mains trust almost the whole Internet, indicating that some
individual configurations are not reasonable at all.
5.2.1 Domains and their Includes. The data set analyzed for
this purpose contains all domains with a valid SPF record
(481,959 domains). Of these domains, about 66% (319,349 do-
mains) use the include mechanism in their SPF records to
add external SPF records. For graph creation, each domain
represents one node, each domain in the include mechanism
represents a node, and each use of the include mechanism
is an edge between the domain and the SPF-included do-
main. The two largest nodes are Google with _spf.google.com
RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain
and Microsoft with spf.protection.outlook.com which both are
trusted by about 30%. Many nodes with a degree of zero lead
to an average degree of 0.98. The average path length is 1.68,
representing one or two include records. The value of the
network diameter is 10, which represents the longest path of
the graph. The majority of the SPF records has a path length
of one or two and only a small number of nodes has a path
length of nine or ten. Larger path lengths result in an invalid
SPF record as the number of DNS lookups must be limited
to ten and thus are not found in our graph.
IP Addresses and AS. In total, all domains with a valid
5.2.2
SPF record contain almost nine million IP addresses. Never-
theless, the number of unique IP addresses is much smaller,
showing that many IP addresses are more often than others
trusted. In our analyzed data set, there are 579,690 unique IP
addresses. We define for the graph creation that each node
is a domain, as well as an AS derived from the IP addresses.
The edges reflect the relationships between the domains and
the included ASes.
In a SPF record, not only individual IP addresses can be
added, but also entire subnets. Therefore, we checked which
subnet size is often used. We found that /32 networks, i.e.,
single IP addresses, are most frequently used. However, also
/24 subnets are often applied (1,747,501 times). Interestingly,
/8 subnets are found in 1,181 cases and subnets larger than
/8 in 41 cases. We even discovered /0 in 11 cases. To make
the following analysis reasonable, we have to determine a
subnet size that is as small as possible, but covers as many
used subnets as possible. We calculated a cumulative distri-
bution function. We cover about 60% of all addresses with
/24 and apply this subnet size in the following for the analy-
sis of the relations between IP address and AS. This means
that networks larger than /24 are divided into multiple /24
networks. This procedure does not change the results about
ASes, as these are divided into larger networks. This modifi-
cation only minimizes the number of duplicate connections
between trusted IP addresses of a domain and its AS.
The three largest ASes are AS8075 (Microsoft), AS15169
(Google LLS), and AS16509 (Amazon). The Amazon simple
email service was only used by 2%, however, many companies
host their email server on Amazon Web Services (AWS),
which results in a large number of trusted IP addresses for
the AS of Amazon. Google and Amazon even have both a
second AS that is trusted by a smaller but still large number
of domains. Besides Google, Microsoft and Amazon, cloud
computing providers and ISPs are among the top connected
nodes. We identified that the average degree of this graph is
3.3, which means that on average domains use IP addresses
from three different ASes. Since we have no connections
between the ASes and only from domains to AS, the average
path length and also maximum path length is one. If we take
360RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain
Tatang, et al.
a look at the out-degree, the majority of the domains uses
IP addresses from one to six different ASes. However, some
trust an enormous number of IP addresses from up to 9,000
different ASes.
5.3 DMARC Measurements
5.3.1 Adoption Rates. According to our most recent scan,
DMARC is only used by up to 11.5% of all examined domains.
Nevertheless, the adoption rate of DMARC is rising contin-
uously ; in comparison, it rises faster than SPF. The total
adoption rates, however, are five times smaller compared to
the SPF measurements. In particular, e.g., in the Alexa scans,
we notice a rise of more than ten times between January
2015 and December 2019. Regarding the adoption rates for
higher-ranked domains, again, we find that higher-ranked
ones implement DMARC with a higher probability similar
to the behaviour we already observed for the SPF measure-
ments. However, the adoption rate drops rather quickly and
especially low-ranked domains rarely adopt DMARC.
5.3.2 Trend analysis. To show that our measured values
represent a significant increase over time, we performed a t-
test (paired two samples for means) for all our scans. We used
our first four measuring points and the last four measuring
points to perform the t-test and set an alpha value of 0.05
for each individual list. The result of the t-test is that the
p-value is in each case smaller than 0.05. This allows us to
reject the null hypothesis on all lists and conclude that we
measured a significant difference, i.e., a significant increase
in the use of DMARC in all measured domain lists between
our first and last conducted scans.
5.3.3 Policies and Content. Considering not only the adop-
tion but also the content of the DMARC records, we observe
that almost one percent invalid DMARC records exist. This
implies if DMARC is in use, mostly it is implemented cor-
rectly. However, we notice that the none policy accounts for
about 75% of all used policies. The most recommended reject
policy is only applied by about 15%. The quarantine policy
is the least used with about 14%. Table 3 summarizes the
number of invalid and valid DMARC records, including their
applied policies across related work [13], our first, and last
Alexa measurements.
5.4 Governmental Domains
Finally, we consider government domains and their use of
DNS-based email authentication mechanisms. Especially the
.gov top-level domain is exclusively used by authorities in
the USA. A primary goal of this analysis is to find out if .gov
domains comply with the Binding Operational Directive
18-01 [4] and implement all email authentication methods
according to the directive. A blogpost from October 2018

showed that one year before the directive came into force
(October 2017) only 20% of US federal domains had imple-
mented DMARC, compared to 74% at the time the directive
came into force [32]. Internationally there are comparable
directives in the UK for .gov.uk domains [40] and a recom-
mendation for the EU to use DMARC for administrative
domains [12]. Other countries with specific top-level do-
mains for their government institutions are, e.g., China with
.gov.cn and France with .gov.fr. In the following, we compare
the usage rates among government agencies. In addition,
we include Japan and Germany, as these are two economi-
cally significant countries. There are significant differences
between the countries. The USA has the highest adoption
rate of DMARC (88%) and SPF (92%) regarding the newest
scan. Especially from 2018 to 2019, both methods were imple-
mented significantly more widely. However, some domains
are still missing to meet BOD-18-01. A domain that is not
implemented correctly is, e.g., cia.gov. The official domains
of the UK are in second place with their adoption rate and
are only slightly worse. There are major differences between
other countries. Interestingly, SPF usage in Japan is very
high, but DMARC usage is shallow. The results underline
that regulatory directives in the US and Britain help to in-
crease the deployment of these security mechanisms in a
specific set of domains (government domains) significantly.
Pure recommendations that also exist in the EU, however,
only lead to small improvements due to their non-binding
character.
5.5 DKIM Measurements
To complement our study, we performed two comprehensive
analyses of the DKIM records and their corresponding DKIM
keys collected in August 2019 and January 2020. This study
is a so far new perspective of DKIM usage in the wild. The
results of both analyses are comparable; the following results
are based on our first collection in August 2019.
5.5.1 Created Selector List. To perform DKIM measurements,
we require a practical DKIM selector list to extract DKIM
keys from the domains. From the analysis of the email dumps,

we learned three types of selectors. First, selectors with syn-
tax [year]-[month]-[day] with and without hyphen. Second,
selectors consisting only of four numbers (year). Third, a
group of 19 different strings. In our created list, there are
3,498 selectors in total, 3,468 entries belong to the first group
starting with the year 2014. For the second group there
are 11 entries from 2008 to 2018, and the strings for the
last group are: default, dkim, google, selektor, selector,
selector1, s1024, s2048, s512, s1, postout, alpha, beta,
gamma, test, mandilla, mailjet, mail, and mail2. Table 4
shows the top 10 most seen DKIM selectors. Note that the
distribution has a long tail, the top 10 only represent 12.9%
of all selectors.
Spam email DKIM Usage. To verify our list, we re-
5.5.2
trieved 1,232,160 spam emails from a spam archive available
at http://artinvoice.hu/spams/. The emails were collected
over 10 years (from 15/5/2009 to 20/08/2019). Altogether, the
files were over 7 GB zipped. We found 26,062 emails with
DKIM-Signature headers in the whole archive. 23,489 (90%)
include valid DKIM selectors. This represents about 2% of all
emails and shows that a few individual cases also use DKIM
for spam messages. About 89% (20,789) of the selectors are al-
ready in our list. Completely randomized selectors, selectors
without patterns, or selectors not found in our generated
list are at 11% (2,700). We argue that our created selector list
is working properly and thus we use it in the following for
collecting DKIM keys.
5.5.3 Gathered DKIM Keys. The DKIM keys were deter-
mined by analyzing email dumps and the selector list with
3,498 selector strings based on the results of the analysis
presented above. In total, we gathered 998,336 DKIM records
from 113,855 different domains. Altogether, we identified
757,470 valid keys and 259,720 invalid ones. As noted earlier,
the adoption rate (11.4%) of DKIM may be higher as truly
random selectors were not included in the created selector
list. The same applies to the analysis of received emails, as
the dataset did not contain emails from all the top 1 million
domains. In total, we identified 105,683 unique DKIM keys.
Among the identified keys, we discovered a total of 4,312
weak keys. A key is weak if it is not RFC 8301 [21] compliant
RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain
and therefore its key length is less than 1,024 bits. We also
found 2,302 duplicate keys, i.e., keys used by more than one
domain. We found that a total of 29,308 keys were invalid
and 211,215 were withdrawn. Withdrawn keys contain an
empty public key. As a result, they can no longer be used
for signing. Invalid keys are DKIM keys that are flawed and
thus do not provide a valid signature key.
5.5.4 Weak Keys. We first focus on the key length. We di-
vided weak keys into keys with 384 bits (66 times) and 786
bits (4,246 times) key length. Weak keys are critical since they
can be factorized in a reasonable amount of time and effort.
Once an attacker is able to factorize a public key, she can
obtain the private key and sign messages on behalf of a par-
ticular domain. The 384 bit keys use three different selector
strings only. 56 domains use as selector dkim, nine domains
default, and one domain mail. The most seen top-level do-
main is nl with more than half of all domains (36 domains).
The 768 bit keys use 3,366 unique selector strings. A conspic-
uous domain here is audiomicro.com, which alone makes up
3,366 of the DKIM records with 768 bit keys. This domain
also uses a date selector string which is apparently renewed
every day. If we remove this domain, 880 domains remain.
In 766 cases, these use default as selector string. Fortunately,
the majority of more than 99% of the keys have either a key
length of 1,024 (693,245 times) or 2,048 bits (59,910 times).
These keys conform to the most recent RFC 8301 document
that specified a recommendation for the used cryptographic
algorithm for signing and the key length for DKIM [21].
Most domains with a weak key are ranked at lower po-
sitions and represent a negligible amount of the top 1,000
domains. However, individual cases that affect a large num-
ber of users exist. One case is Facebook with the domain
facebook.com. This domain is using a weak key with 768
bits length and default as the DKIM selector. Other domains
using weak keys as illustrated in Table 5, which represents
the top 10 highly ranked domains with weak keys.
Shared Duplicate Keys. Next, we consider duplicated
5.5.5
keys in detail. In total, we detected 2,302 duplicated keys
which were used by 654,089 domains. In some cases, du-
plicated keys were used across different top-level domains,
but with the same second-level domain. For example, Ama-
zon uses the same DKIM key for the domains amazon.com,
amazon.de, and amazon.co.uk. This behavior is not critical,
as these domains belong to the same organization or com-
pany. A second scenario is a duplicated key for the same
domain with different selectors. Obviously, this is not critical
either. Therefore, we remove all domains that share keys
only with the same second-level domain, but different top-
level-domains and domains sharing keys among their alias
domain names. This results in 13,373 remaining domains
with 1,881 keys.
