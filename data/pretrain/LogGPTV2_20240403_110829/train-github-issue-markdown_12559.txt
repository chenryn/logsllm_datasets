On Mac OS X, you can change the text of the primary "OK" button in open and
save dialogs by providing a "prompt":

It'd be great to make this an option on the dialog APIs. We want to show an
open dialog and ask the user to create / select a folder where files will be
saved, and change the prompt from "Open" to "Choose".
