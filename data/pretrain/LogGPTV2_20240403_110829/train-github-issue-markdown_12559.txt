On macOS, you can customize the text of the primary "OK" button in open and save dialogs by setting a "prompt." This can be achieved using the `NSSavePanel` class, as documented in the Apple Developer documentation:

- [NSSavePanel Class Reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nssavepanel/1525079-prompt)

It would be beneficial to add this functionality as an option in our dialog APIs. Specifically, we want to display an open dialog that asks the user to create or select a folder where files will be saved. In this case, we would like to change the button text from "Open" to "Choose."

This feature is somewhat related to issue #5178.
