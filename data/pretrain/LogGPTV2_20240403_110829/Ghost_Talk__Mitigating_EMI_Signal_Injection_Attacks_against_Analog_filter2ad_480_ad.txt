transmission over EMI, we used the Speech Transmission In-
dex (STI) [28], a standard measure to predict speech intelli-
gibility. The index is computed from the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) at 8 octave bands covering the range from 125 Hz to
], where
n = 8 for most applications, Wi is a predeﬁned weight
assigned to each octave band, and SN Ri is the received
audio SNR at the octave band i. The STI ranges from 0 to
1, where 1 indicates a high likelihood of intelligible speech
transmission. We compared results between the injected
audio over EMI and the legitimate acoustic channel.
Experimental setup. We chose three devices with micro-
phones: the Bluetooth headset and webcam used earlier, in
addition to another webcam, a Logitech Quickcam Vision
Pro. For the audio, we used a standard STI test waveform
consisting of a uniform mixture of frequencies to allow
an objective assessment of the response proﬁles. For the
acoustic channel, the STI waveform was played through a
MacBook Pro speaker system and recorded by the micro-
phone of the device under test. For the EMI channel, we
modulated the STI waveform on the resonant frequencies of
each device and transmitted the result over the air.
Results. We computed the average STI for the 3 devices
over audio with a mean of 0.69, and over EMI with a mean
of 0.72, indicating that both channels are comparable for
speech transmission. Notice that the waveform transmitted
via the EMI channel has a slightly higher STI. The injected
signal induces voltages on the conducting path between the
microphone and the ampliﬁer and is therefore free of the
mechanical limits of the microphone itself. That effect is
also apparent in the lower octave bands in Figure 11.

Figure 12. Overview of the defenses, integrated in a single system. The signal ﬁrst goes through a number of analog defenses to attenuate the induced signal
before conversion into a digital format. A subsystem simultaneously takes readings of the EMI level in the environment to determine the contamination
level. Further ﬁltering is then possible based on the estimated EMI level. Active probing can also be used to help discriminate between induced and
measured signals. Finally, if the probing results indicate a forged waveform capable of forcing improper actuation, we revert to a safe default.
V. DEFENSES
A. Analog defenses
The goal of our defense set is to improve the trustwor-
thiness of the sensor readings by attenuating the induced
signals or at minimum detect EMI attacks. We propose a
system (Figure 12) composed of a series of analog and
digital defenses that can attenuate the EMI on the analog
sensor circuit, differentiate between induced and measured
signals in the digital circuit, remove the induced signals
if possible, and revert to known safe defaults if the inter-
fering signal is too strong. Although the analog defenses
are known and some are already applied to implantable
medical devices, consumer electronics are less protected. As
the cost of deploying those defenses is device-speciﬁc, we
instead quantiﬁed the attenuation which can be used for the
cost/beneﬁt analysis. The analog defenses on their own may
not be enough against strong emitters or baseband emitters.
Thus in addition, we propose to use some digital defenses:
adaptive ﬁnite impulse response ﬁlters that can improve the
SIR, a probing-based method that can distinguish between
induced and measured signals, and a safe default mode for
devices in the presence of strong EMI attackers.
In the analog portion of the sensing circuit, there are
three common defenses: shielding, differential comparators,
and ﬁlters. All of these are used to some extent in modern
CIEDs, but not in commodity electronics. In this section we
apply those techniques and measure the resulting attenuation
with waveforms used in our modulated attacks. Those results
can then be used for cost/beneﬁt analysis to improve the
design of current systems.
1) Shielding: The application of a conducting material
to shield a component from electromagnetic radiation is
well-known but absent from most commodity devices we
tested. We coated the exterior of one of our webcams
with a conducting surface leaving large holes for a number
of components. Those include the camera lens, two large
buttons on the side, the microphone and the mechanical
stand. Even with large imperfections in the shield,
the
attenuation of the recovered EMI signal was over 40 dB,
forcing an attacker to transmit 104 times more power to
have the same effect.

possible or not sufﬁcient, a reference signal can be used
to remove the common mode voltage using a differential
circuit, commonly used in analog electronics [32]. By mea-
suring the difference in potential between two voltages,
the common mode interference present on both signals is
effectively ﬁltered out.
Early designs of pacemakers used unipolar leads (one sin-
gle conductor in lead connected to the cardiac tissue), which
was eventually phased out in favor of the “true bipolar”
design [27]. Under similar conditions with a signal injection
waveform (see Section III) we measured the attenuation of
the induced signal from a bipolar lead to be 30 dB, showing
a signiﬁcant reduction in EMI induced signal with a simple
defense.
Even with a bipolar design, our results indicate a possibil-
ity to induce a differential mode signal across the anode and
the cathode of the leads. In free air, with a 100 Hz sinusoid
on an 80 mW source at 20 cm, we measured that the induced
voltage difference is on the order of 5 mV and the phase shift
is on the order of π/10. The differential voltage and phase
difference became very small with the tips dipped in the
saline solution, leading to a severe drop in the differential
voltage. We had to signiﬁcantly increase the transmit power
of our emitter to return the measured differential voltages to
around 5 mV even when dipped in saline solution, indicating
that the attacker can compensate with increased power.
3) Filters: A ﬁlter that attenuates signals outside a sen-
sor’s baseband frequency can reduce the vulnerable fre-
quency range of that sensor. Such ﬁlters are already in use
in medical devices, but they seem more sparse in com-
modity electronics. Those are therefore more vulnerable to
signal injection attacks with a high frequency carrier, better
matched to the vulnerable circuit. To test the effectiveness
of ﬁlters for commodity electronics, we used a custom-built
active low-pass ﬁlter at 500MHz to attenuate high-frequency
components while allowing audio signals (below 50 kHz) to
pass. In the case of the 836 MHz carrier from the attack
waveform we suggested in Section IV, an attenuation of
over 40dB was measured, making it a very good attenuator
against our signal.
B. Digital Defenses
Due to physical requirements or packaging limitations of
implantable medical devices, some of the analog defenses
outlined above may have a limited effect, especially against
a strong emitter. As a result, the output of the sensor may still
contain injected signals. In addition to the analog attenuation
defenses, we propose techniques on the digitized signal to
estimate, track, clean, and verify the state of the signal as it
moves through the system.
1) Signal contamination: A necessary component of our
signal injection attack is an EM wave to carry the signal. If
a component in the victim’s device is available to capture
only the radiated signal, we can estimate the EMI level
this estimation the signal
in the environment. We call
contamination. Components downstream can then use the
contamination level to determine the appropriate defenses
to apply.
As a metric of the required conditions for EMI attacks,
we use the root mean square of the waveform amplitude
in a window of size w ms to estimate the EMI level in the
environment. To compute the contamination level, lc, we
compare the measured level (At) to one calibrated in a quiet
environment(A0).
lc = RM S(At)

where t is the start time for a window of size w under
consideration, and RM S is the root mean square of the
waveform amplitude as deﬁned by

where T < t < T + w.
In communicating implantable medical devices, the RF
antenna can be used to estimate the ambient EMI. In non-
communicating devices that lack an antenna, a reference
conductor can be used instead. We assume that the monitor-
ing component is located close enough to the vulnerable part
of the sensor to receive comparable levels of EMI radiation.
In the presence of a pulsed EMI signal with increasing
power, similar to the pulse from Section III, the commu-
nication antenna on our disassembled CIED recovered the
signal shown in the spectrogram in Figure 13 (Top). The
300 Hz pulses with increasing power are clearly visible.
The bottom graph shows the computed contamination level
with a window of size w = 100 ms based on the observed
waveforms. In our free air experiments, a pacing inhibition
would occur for devices exposed to contamination levels of
2.1 and higher.

2) Adaptive ﬁltering: If the contamination level exceeds a
threshold that can cause improper actuation, we can activate
an adaptive ﬁltering mechanism [33] and use the measured
contamination waveform to estimate the RF-induced voltage
at the leads and clean the received signal. The adaptive ﬁlters
dynamically adjust the signals between the leads and the
antenna to determine a map that can be used to translate the
waveform between the two components†. Our end goal is
to attenuate the EMI-induced waveform on the signal at the
leads, thus increasing the Signal-to-Interference ratio.
Figure 14. Adaptive noise canceling system adapted to cancel the forged
signal. The output of the system is used to estimate the forged signal given
the waveform on the compensating circuit.
Figure 14 summarizes a typical design for an adaptive
noise cancelling system [33]. The sensing circuit and the
compensating circuit act differently to the forged signal m[n]
added to them. y[n] is the observed signal composed of the
measured signal x[n] added to some noise w1[n] and the
forged signal m[n]. We assume that the antenna component
is a linear system of otherwise unknown properties. The
output from that circuit is v2[n] and feeds into the adaptive
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) ﬁlter. That ﬁlter uses the
output from the adaptive algorithm to estimate the original
forged waveform ˆm[n]. The resulting waveform is subtracted
from the observed waveform at the lead to yield the cleaned-
up output which feeds back into the adaptive algorithm to
allow the system to adapt to changing waveform amplitude.
The reaction time of the ﬁlter depends on coefﬁcients used
in the adaptive algorithm.
We tested the algorithm against one of our most effective
attacking waveforms from Section III, namely the EC13
modulated on a 100 Hz sinusoid. The results shown in
Figure 15 indicate a large error at the onset of the attacker’s
signal (top plot), but the error quickly decreases allowing a
recovery of the original measured waveform (bottom plot).
The forged signal
in this case was severely attenuated,
leaving a relatively clean measured signal that would be
otherwise obscured.
3) Cardiac probe: Systems that can measure the result of
their actuation may be able to distinguish if they are under
attack. The basic idea is to use the actuation to determine
if the sensor readings follow the expected readings. If
the attacker cannot observe the actuation, the advantage is
further tipped towards the victim.
†The mapping accounts for differences in the locations, impedance, and
shapes of the two antennas

FIR ﬁlters against one of our most effective attacking
waveforms. The measured signal waveform is the original ANSI/AAMI
EC13 ﬁg 3a, used to simulate a human heart beat. We observe that the
estimation error is a maximum in the ﬁrst cycles of a large amplitude
change, but the system quickly adapts, reducing the level of the forged
signal, thereby increasing the SIR and the probability that the system would
behave correctly in the presence of this waveform.
For CIEDs, in the presence of a sufﬁciently powerful at-
tacker, the signal received at the processing point in a cardiac
pacing device may still contain a residual interference with
a contamination level above 2.1 that could cause improper
actuation. To discern between the measured and induced
waveforms, a CIED can use its direct connection to the
cardiac tissue to test if the signal was legitimate.
During a normal cardiac cycle, the tissue contraction pro-
duces voltage peaks observable on electrograms measured
by the intra-cardiac implanted leads. Immediately after a
contraction, during a brief time span called the absolute
refractory period (ARP), the cardiac tissue will not contract
again, even if stimulated with a low-energy pacing pulse
(around 10 µJ.) We use this property to discern between real
and forged signal. We send a pacing pulse immediately after
detecting a voltage peak that may result from a contraction
in the tissue around the lead tip. That pulse should reach
the cardiac tissue while it is still in the ARP and therefore
we expect no signal back on the lead for about 200 ms [22].
If we observe another peak immediately after sending our
pacing pulse, there are two possible causes:
1. The cardiac tissue contracted, indicating that a forged
peak was present in the signals; or
2. Independent of the tissue response, there was an induced
peak on the lead.
In either case, the signal from the lead is not trustworthy
and the sensing signal should not be used.
To test the response of the cardiac tissue to our pacing
pulse probe method, we used the University of Pennsylva-
nia’s Virtual Heart Model [34], [35]. We set the simulator to
the default cardiac conﬁguration with no running pacemaker
and the intra-cardiac monitoring probe and pacing lead
at the tip of the right ventricle. After obtaining a stable
cardiac rhythm, we sent pulses both during the absolute

cardiac tissue pulse was observed within 40 ms of the onset
of the 10 ms pacing pulse. These results suggest that a pacing
pulse could give us information on the current state of the
cardiac tissue. However, more studies are necessary on the
health care aspect of this proposed method.

That technique is heavily dependent on the sensor and the
application and is left as future work on speciﬁc systems. In
the third case, the victim can be notiﬁed through an audible
alarm about the possibility of an attack, and allow the victim
to be moved away from the attacking emitter.
VI. RELATED WORK
The effects of electromagnetic interference either received
on electronic circuits or emitted from them are known,
although the intentional injection of forged signals due to
“back-door” coupling on the analog sensing circuit remains
to be investigated. Anderson [6] outlines situations allow-

methods for information exﬁltration due to EMI sometimes
referred to as TEMPEST in the military milieu. Further, the
