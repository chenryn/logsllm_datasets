User: I'm looking into Pylons and was wondering, should I use Paste as the webserver or can I use Apache? 
Are there advantages to using Paste?
Would you recommend against using Apache?
How should I host the sites?
Assistant: I'm using Nginx (with fastcgi) or Apache for hosting Pylons sites, mostly because lack of some "production" features in Paste, but for development Paste is very usefull and handy.
