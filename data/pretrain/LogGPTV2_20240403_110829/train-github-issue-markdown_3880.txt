I've updated to **2.7** and changed my choice types to use
`choices_as_values`.  
Most of my choices are simple "No" or "Yes". But they must not be preselected
- the user is forced to choose. That is why none of my radio buttons is
initially checked.
I tried this with **2.7** :
    $builder->add('aberdeenBlind', 'choice', array(
                    'choices' => array(
                        'Ja' => true,
                        'Nein' => false
                    ),
                    'choices_as_values' => true,
                    'expanded' => true,
                    'required' => true
                ))
Unfortunately the second radio button (false => 'Nein') is preselected. This
also happens when flipping the order of the `choices`. The `false` choice is
always preselected.
I played around with other options e.g. `placeholder`, `empty_*` etc. but then
I recognized:  
**This only seems to happen when using`boolean` values. The following example
would not preselect any value**:
    $builder->add('aberdeenBlind', 'choice', array(
                    'choices' => array(
                        'Ja' => 'Y', // or '1'
                        'Nein' => 'N' // or '0'
                    ),
                    'choices_as_values' => true,
                    'expanded' => true,
                    'required' => true
                ))
