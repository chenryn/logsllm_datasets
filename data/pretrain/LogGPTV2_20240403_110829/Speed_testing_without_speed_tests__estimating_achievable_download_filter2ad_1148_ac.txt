the aggregated measurements from all regions in roughly the
Paciﬁc and Central timezones.
We perform active throughput measurements from probes
in several stationary locations. Each probe performs a
throughput measurement by downloading a 3MB ﬁle via
FTP from a well-provisioned server close to the Gn inter-
face. 2 to 3 measurements per probe are collected each hour.
Each region we consider in this section has probes in 3 to
12 diﬀerent vantage points. The active max-throughput es-
timate we report each hour is the mean of all measurements
from all probes in a region. We note that the active probes
are generally placed in locations with good RF conditions.
Thus, we expect that they would perform better than the
average subscriber handset.

24-30, 2010. Then, we compute the TI-F and TI-T esti-
mates based on traﬃc observed on April 3-7, 2010. We
also compute the na¨ıve All 1MB+ Flows estimate, which
corresponds to the mean throughput of all ﬂow records with
total bytes ≥ 1 MB. We compare these passive max-
throughput estimates to the active estimates for each hour
during the same time period.
4.2 Results
Figure 5 shows a scatter plot comparing active and pas-
sive estimates. Each point represents the estimate for one
hour in the largest region. If active and passive estimates re-
port the same values, then the points would fall on the x=y
line. We see that the All 1MB+ Flows approach produces
estimates that are signiﬁcantly less than the active measure-
ments. TI-F produces estimates that are much closer, but are
still generally less. This may be because some ﬂows in the
TI are still rate-limited by application behaviors that we do
not detect. It may also be because the active measurement
probes are in higher quality vantage points (i.e., better RF
conditions) than most real users. During a few hours, the
TI-F estimate is higher than the active measurement (i.e.,
the points above the diagonal). These cases can probably
be attributed to variance in the small number of active mea-
surement samples. Evaluating which set of measurements is
closer to the “ground truth” is the subject of future work,
but we are encouraged that both active estimates and the
TI-F estimates show a similar trend over time.
Relative Diﬀerence. To see if this trend generalizes, we
compare the relative diﬀerence between the passive and ac-
tive estimates in other regions. Figure 6 compares the rel-
ative diﬀerence between each set of passive and active esti-
mates for all regions and the 10 regions with the most active
probe vantage points. The top of each bar indicates the me-
dian relative diﬀerence (over all hours) and the error bars
show the 25th and 75th percentiles. We see that both the
TI-F and TI-T estimates have roughly the same relative dif-
ference over all regions and both have relative diﬀerences
substantially less than the All 1MB+ Flows approach. Most
TI-F and TI-T estimates are less than 30% diﬀerent than the
active measurements, while most All 1MB+ Flows estimates

are more than 50% diﬀerent. One anomaly is region R7,
where the TI estimates have greater relative diﬀerences. We
believe this is due to the active probes being in unrepre-
sentative locations because this is the only location where
the active estimates are lower than all passive estimates, on
average.
Correlation. In addition to similar estimate values, we also
expect good passive estimates to be correlated with the ac-
tive estimates over time. That is, when the active estimate
goes down (e.g., due to contention) we also generally expect
the passive estimate to go down. Figure 7 shows Pearson’s
correlation coeﬃcient between each passive estimate time
series and the corresponding active estimate time series in
all regions and the top 10. The error bars show 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals of the correlation coeﬃcients. Two perfectly
correlated signals would have a correlation of 1 and any cor-
relation greater than 0.6 is well correlated. We see that both
TI-F and TI-T are at least as correlated with the active esti-
mates as the All 1MB+ Flows estimates. The correlation is
substantially greater than the All 1MB+ Flows estimates in
some regions, such as R2 and R6.
The regions where the TI estimates are less correlated
with the active estimates, such as R2, R4, R5, and R7, are
regions where there are fewer samples either in the TI or
from the active probes. When many vantage points are ag-
gregated, such as in the All case, the TI and active estimates’
correlations are very high (close to 0.9). This suggests that
when enough samples are available, the TI estimates corre-
late well to aggregate network-level eﬀects such as shared
congestion. To improve the TI’s correlation of these eﬀects
at ﬁner network granularities, we are currently increasing
the sampling rate of ﬂow types in the TI from 3% to 100%
of users. This is feasible because the number of TI ﬂows is
small relative to the total ﬂows that traverse the network.
5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Our results demonstrate that max-throughput can be es-
timated using passive measurements via judicious selection
of ﬂows. In this paper, we presented our initial attempt at
such a selection by identifying non-rate-limited ﬂow types
to place in a Throughput Index.
By applying the TI approach to more real traﬃc, we hope
to resolve a few outstanding issues. First, the the minimum
ﬂow size necessary to reach TCP steady-state depends on the
RTT and the available capacity, both of which are dynamic
quantities. We plan to explore how this ﬂow size can be
varied based on network conditions, which should improve
the TI’s max-throughput estimates when available capacity
grows. Second, the ﬁltering of certain ﬂow records presents
a trade-oﬀ between the number of samples and their aggre-
gate accuracy. We plan to explore how to utilize the noisier
rate-limited samples when an insuﬃcient number of non-
rate-limited samples exist. Third, application protocol and
content-provider behavior can change over time. We plan to
explore how to detect such changes dynamically by exam-
ining how each ﬂow type contributes to the TI over time.
Fourth, our approach assumes that most ﬂows in the TI are
typical and benign. In the future, we will explore how ma-
licious and abnormal ﬂows that skew the max-throughput
estimate can be detected. Finally, while we believe the
TI approach generalizes to wired networks, further study
is needed to understand the impact of the greater hetero-
geneity in vantage points and TCP stacks.
