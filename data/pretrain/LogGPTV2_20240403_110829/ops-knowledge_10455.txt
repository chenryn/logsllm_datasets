User: My website runs on Python on Google App Engine, and I've setup a Virtual Machine to use libraries that weren't supported by the default App Engine environment. Now I need to send data from my app to the VM and retrieve the response. Data in this case will be an email address and an email message. 
Currently I am testing with a POST request through urllib2. Is there a better way to do this?
Assistant: Sticking with the described POST request using urllib2. We decided we might move this part of the project to a different provider so better to not use Google Cloud only methods.
