### Offline Disk Command

#### Description
The `offline disk` command transitions an online disk, which is currently in focus, to an offline state. If a dynamic disk within a disk group is taken offline, its status changes to "missing," and the group will indicate that a disk is offline. The missing disk is then moved to the "invalid" group. If the dynamic disk is the last one in the group, its status changes to "offline," and the now-empty group is removed.

#### Important Notes
- A disk must be selected for the `offline disk` command to succeed. Use the `select disk` command to choose a disk and shift the focus to it.
- This command also works on disks in SAN (Storage Area Network) online mode by changing the SAN mode to offline.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
offline disk [noerr]
```

#### Parameters
- **noerr**: For scripting purposes only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process subsequent commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

#### Examples
To take the disk with the current focus offline, type:
```plaintext
offline disk
```

This command will transition the selected disk to an offline state, following the rules and behaviors described above.
