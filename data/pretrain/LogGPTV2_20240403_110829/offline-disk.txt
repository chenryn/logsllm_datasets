offline disk
Takes the online disk with focus to the offline state. If a dynamic disk in a disk group is taken offline, the status of the disk changes to missing and the group shows a disk that's offline. The missing disk is moved to the invalid group. If the dynamic disk is the last disk in the group, then the status of the disk changes to offline, and the empty group is removed.
Note
A disk must be selected for the offline disk command to succeed. Use the select disk command to select a disk and shift the focus to it.
This command also works on disks in SAN online mode by changing the SAN mode to offline.
Syntax
offline disk [noerr]
