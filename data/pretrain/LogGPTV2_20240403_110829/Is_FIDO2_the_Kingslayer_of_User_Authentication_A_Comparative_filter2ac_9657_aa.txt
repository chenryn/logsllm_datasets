**Abstract:**
The latest contender to replace text-based passwords as the primary web authentication method is the FIDO2 standard. Developed and supported by the FIDO Alliance and the W3C, FIDO2 has gained widespread support across browsers and is increasingly adopted by service providers. While it supports multi-factor and two-factor authentication, its single-factor, passwordless authentication using security tokens has garnered significant attention. Despite its clear security and deployability advantages, the shift from a familiar knowledge factor (passwords) to a possession factor (security tokens) raises questions about user acceptance.

This paper presents the first large-scale lab study of FIDO2 single-factor authentication, gathering insights into users' perceptions, acceptance, and concerns regarding passwordless authentication. Participants engaged in hands-on tasks using a security key and then provided feedback through a survey. The results indicate that users are willing to accept a direct replacement of text-based passwords with a security key for single-factor authentication. However, new concerns were identified that could hinder the widespread adoption of FIDO2. To address these, we provide concrete recommendations to support the ongoing proliferation of passwordless authentication on the web.

## 1. Introduction

For decades, efforts have been made to replace text-based passwords with more secure alternatives for web authentication. However, no alternative has yet achieved this goal due to the inability to improve security while maintaining the same level of deployability and usability as passwords. The FIDO2 standard, jointly developed by the FIDO Alliance and the W3C, is the latest contender. FIDO2 builds on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard and offers a standardized way for websites to use hardware authentication devices, such as security keys. It supports these devices as both a second factor and, more importantly, as a single factor for passwordless authentication.

Given the backing of major institutions, FIDO2 has been hailed in the media as a "password-killer." From an academic perspective, FIDO2 appears to be a promising candidate for replacing text-based passwords. It provides credentials that cannot be phished, replayed, or compromised by server breaches. As an open web authentication standard (WebAuthn), it is supported by virtually all browsers and has native implementations on platforms like Android and Windows. It also supports various authenticator devices, including security keys and integrated authenticators like Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and biometric sensors.

While FIDO2 offers strong security, high convenience, and potential for widespread adoption, it remains uncertain whether end-users will accept the paradigm shift from "something they know" (passwords) to "something they have" (security tokens). Specifically, we aim to determine if end-users accept FIDO2-based single-factor authentication and, if not, what factors could inhibit adoption and how these concerns can be addressed.

To answer these questions, we conducted the first large-scale comparative user study of FIDO2 passwordless authentication. We recruited 94 participants and randomly assigned them to two groups. One group used a Yubico Security Key for single-factor authentication, while the other group, serving as a control, used traditional text-based passwords. Participants then reflected on their experiences through a survey. The study measured the usability and acceptance of the authentication methods, as well as user-specific factors that may influence these variables.

Our results show that users are very satisfied with directly replacing text-based passwords with a security key and are willing to accept passwordless authentication. This is encouraging for the goal of replacing passwords. However, we also identified several potential obstacles. These include the need for secure and efficient authenticator revocation and account recovery, concerns about the physical form factor and everyday usability of security keys, and difficulties in trusting the new technology. Despite these issues, users' strong acceptance of single-factor authentication with security keys suggests that the disadvantages of text-based passwords have become overwhelming.

In summary, while FIDO2 has the potential to be the "kingslayer" of passwords, further development must consider user perspectives and needs. Based on our findings, we provide concrete recommendations for FIDO2 supporters, web developers, and researchers to foster the adoption of passwordless authentication on the web.

## 2. Background on FIDO2

FIDO2 is an open authentication standard developed jointly by the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It extends the work of the FIDO Alliance on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard. FIDO2 consists of two specifications:

1. **WebAuthn Protocol**: This protocol provides a standardized way for websites to authenticate users via cryptographic authenticators. It supports both CTAP2 (the latest version) and backwards-compatible U2F (now considered CTAP1).

2. **Client-to-Authenticator-Protocol (CTAP2)**: This application-layer protocol enables communication between a WebAuthn client (e.g., a browser) and a cryptographic authenticator device. Authenticators can be external (e.g., security keys, smartphones) or internal (e.g., TPMs, biometric sensors).

Unlike U2F, FIDO2 supports two-factor, multi-factor, and single-factor (passwordless) authentication. In single-factor mode, user verification can be as simple as pressing a button on the authenticator or more complex, such as entering a PIN or using biometrics.

At the time of writing, major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge have integrated stable support for WebAuthn. Several websites, including Dropbox, Microsoft accounts, Google accounts, and Twitter, offer FIDO2-based second factors. Native platform support is also forthcoming, with Microsoft integrating FIDO2 into Windows Hello. Additionally, there is growing support for FIDO2 through libraries and tutorials.

In terms of security, FIDO2 is an extension of FIDO U2F and offers high-level security based on public key cryptography. It provides various advantages over text-based passwords, including no shared secrets, unlinkable reuse of authenticators, and resilience to replay attacks.

**Yubico Security Key**: The Yubico Security Key is an implementation of a FIDO2 roaming authenticator. It is designed to be a portable and secure device for single-factor authentication.
