Abstract—The newest contender for succeeding passwords as
the incumbent web authentication scheme is the FIDO2 standard.
Jointly developed and backed by the FIDO Alliance and the
W3C, FIDO2 has found support in virtually every browser,
ﬁnds increasing support by service providers, and has adoptions
beyond browser-software on its way. While it supports MFA and
2FA, its single-factor, passwordless authentication with security
tokens has received the bulk of attention and was hailed by
its supporters and the media as the solution that will replace
text-passwords on the web. Despite its obvious security and
deployability beneﬁts—a setting that no prior solution had in
this strong combination—the paradigm shift from a familiar
knowledge factor to purely a possession factor raises questions
about the acceptance of passwordless authentication by end-users.
This paper presents the ﬁrst large-scale lab study of FIDO2
single-factor authentication to collect insights about end-users’
perception, acceptance, and concerns about passwordless au-
thentication. Through hands-on tasks our participants gather
ﬁrst-hand experience with passwordless authentication using a
security key, which they afterwards reﬂect on in a survey. Our
results show that users are willing to accept a direct replacement
of text-based passwords with a security key for single-factor
authentication. That is an encouraging result in the quest to
replace passwords. But, our results also identify new concerns
that can potentially hinder the widespread adoption of FIDO2
passwordless authentication. In order to mitigate these factors,
we derive concrete recommendations to try to help in the ongoing
proliferation of passwordless authentication on the web.
I. INTRODUCTION
For decades we have tried to replace text-based passwords
with more secure alternatives for end-user authentication on
the web. But none of the alternatives has achieved this goal
until today [1], [2], since none of them could improve security
while at the same time offering the same level of deployability
and usability as passwords. The newest contender for suc-
ceeding text-based passwords is the FIDO2 standard that was
jointly developed by the FIDO Alliance—an organization with
more than 250 member companies worldwide [3], including
Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, or VISA—and the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international
standards organization for the web. FIDO2 continues the
development of the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) authentication
standard and offers websites a standardized way to make use
of hardware authentication devices, such as security keys. Like
U2F, it supports hardware authentication devices as a second-
factor, however, most importantly, it also supports them as
a single-factor for passwordless authentication. Considering
the institutions backing FIDO2, this new standard has been
presented in the media as a "password-killer" [4], [5], [6],
[7]. Also from an academic point of view, using the frame-
work by Bonneau et al. [1] (as we explain in Section II),
FIDO2 seems like a promising candidate for succeeding text-
based passwords as the incumbent end-user authentication
scheme: it provides credentials that cannot be phished, re-
played, nor are they subject
to server breaches; being an
open web authentication standard (WebAuthn), it is supported
by virtually all browsers, and native implementations, like
on Android and Windows, exist and more are forthcoming;
it can provide a consistent user experience; and it supports
various authenticator devices, including security keys, like the
ones from Yubico or Feitian, but also integrated authenticators
commonly available on end-user devices, like Trusted Platform
Modules, Android keystore, or Apple TouchID. In fact, in our
expert assessment, none of the existing alternatives to text-
based passwords offers as many beneﬁts in Bonneau’s et al.
framework as FIDO2 with single-factor authentication.
Thus, while FIDO2 offers strong end-user authentication,
high convenience, and has great potential for widespread
availability, it is an open question whether end-users accept
this paradigm shift from "something they know" to "something
they have" (i.e., passwordless authentication). More concretely,
we want
to ﬁnd an answer to "whether end-users accept
FIDO2-based authentication as a single factor" and if not,
"which factors could inhibit an adoption by end-users and
which potential paths exist to address the end-user concerns?"
To answer these questions, we conducted the ﬁrst large-scale
comparative user study of FIDO2 passwordless authentication.
We recruited 94 participants and randomly distributed them
among two groups. In the course of hands-on tasks, one group
used a Yubico Security Key as 1FA (passwordless) and the
other group, here acting as a control group, used regular text-
based passwords for web authentication. Afterwards, we asked
participants to reﬂect on this experience in a survey. The
usability and the acceptance of the authentication mechanisms
as well as user-speciﬁc factors that may effect these variables
were measured using standardized methods. In order to get a
more complete picture of user perception, we then used free

text questions to capture the ideas/beneﬁts/drawbacks/concerns
regarding the two authentication methods. As a result, our
collected data allowed us to evaluate the usability and ac-
ceptance of FIDO2 passwordless authentication and to gather
user concerns and feedback about the paradigm shift to FIDO2
passwordless authentication.
Our results show that lay users are very satisﬁed when
directly replacing text-based passwords with a security key and
are willing to accept such passwordless authentication over
regular text-based passwords. This is an encouraging result on
the road to replace passwords and indicates that FIDO2 has the
potential to be the kingslayer of text-based passwords. How-
ever, we also identiﬁed several potential obstacles that could
stop FIDO2 from reaching its goal. Besides known problems
of token-based authentication, we identify new issues: First,
we ﬁnd that in case of 1FA, users associate possession of the
authenticator with the implicit guarantee that no one else can
access the account and, vice versa, the loss of the device with
an (impending) illegal account access. This raises the question
for a secure and efﬁcient authenticator revocation in addition
to account recovery—none of which exists as of today. Second,
our study identiﬁes new problems with the physical form factor
and features of authenticators. Our participants questioned
the suitability for everyday use and mentioned authentication
scenarios for which, in contrast to passwords, they do not see
the possibility to use a security key (e.g., public computers
without connectivity or delegation of account access to trusted
persons). Last but not least, we ﬁnd that it is often very difﬁcult
for users to trust this new technology, mainly because it is
such a strong break to previous authentication methods. Our
participants had no mental models to understand and evaluate
the functionality and security of such security keys.
In this light, we ﬁnd it astonishing that users accept 1FA
authentication with security keys so strongly despite these
shortcomings. The main reason could be that the disadvantages
and weaknesses of text-based passwords have become so
obvious and overwhelming for users that they are looking
for a technology that can free them from this burden. In
summary, we ﬁnd that there is still a gap between the users’
concerns and what
the current status-quo of FIDO2 1FA
provides. While FIDO2 has the potential to be the kingslayer
of passwords, the further development of the standard and
of authenticator devices has to more strongly include the
perspective of the users and their needs to gain the support
of lay end-users. Building upon our results, we try to give
concrete recommendations for the supporters of FIDO2, web
developers, and further research that hopefully help to foster
the proliferation of passwordless authentication on the web.
II. BACKGROUND ON FIDO2
FIDO2 is an open authentication standard developed jointly
by the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance and the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C), extending prior work by the
FIDO Alliance on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard,
which has also been subject of the academic studies (see
Section III). The standard consists of two speciﬁcations that

reﬂect the two authoring organizations (see Figure 1): (1) the
WebAuthn protocol [8] for a standardized access by WebAuthn
relying parties (e.g., website) to authenticate users via CTAP2
or backwards-compatible via U2F (now considered CTAP1)
through a WebAuthn conforming client
like the browser;
(2) the Client-to-Authenticator-Protocol (CTAP2) [9], an ap-
plication layer protocol used for communication between a
WebAuthn client (like browser) and a conforming crypto-
graphic authenticator device that can either be external and
roaming via USB, Bluetooth, or NFC communication (e.g.,
security key or Android smartphone [10]), or internal (e.g.,
TPM, Trusted Execution Environment, or TouchID [11]). In
contrast to its predecessor U2F, FIDO2 supports two-factor as
well as multi-factor and even single-factor (i.e., passwordless)
user authentication [12]. As a result, FIDO2 supports different
levels of user veriﬁcation, such as a simple test-of-user-
presence (e.g., pressing the button on the authenticator) or
user authentication to the authenticator via PIN or biometrics.
Particularly in single-factor mode, this should ensure user
consent to the authentication process.
At the time of writing, various browsers have already inte-
grated stable support for WebAuthn [13], including Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, and Edge, and also the number of websites
that support WebAuthn is steadily increasing, for instance,
Dropbox [14], Microsoft accounts [15], [16], Google accounts,
Twitter [17], and others [18] offer FIDO2-based second fac-
tors. Also native platform support for FIDO2 is forthcoming,
for instance, Microsoft supports it as part of their Windows
Hello authentication [19]. Adopters of FIDO2 for non-browser
clients or for websites (relying parties) are also supported in
their task through an increasing number of FIDO2 libraries
and tutorials [20], [16], [21], [22], [23], [24].
In terms of security, FIDO2 is an extension of FIDO U2F
and offers the same high security-level based on public key
cryptography (see [25] for an overview). At its core, FIDO2
is a challenge-response protocol with mutual authentication
using hardware-based authenticators, which offers various ad-
vantages over text-based passwords: no shared secrets between
user and websites that can be leaked through server breaches,
phishing, or key-loggers; unlinkable reuse of the same authen-
ticator for different accounts; or resilience to replay attacks.
