Table 8: Information on the hosting infrastructure used
by the two mobile threats.
5.3.2 Hosting Infrastructure
Here we describe in detail the Internet infrastructure used
by both threats. Table 8 shows the autonomous systems,
country codes, and the number of hosts within each AS
4 pointed to throughout their life-
that qnameǫ or qnameβ
time. Figure 12 shows how the host pointed to by qnameǫ
changed over time. The host was primarily located in AS
6389, but for brief periods of time the domain resolves to
hosts outside AS 6389. Comparing the activity of threat ǫ
(Figure 10) to the changes in the host (Figure 12) reveal
that host changes were correlated with activity peaks (as
seen in April 2011). Figure 13, shows host changes over-
time for threat β. Like threat ǫ, the host infrastructure was
relatively stable until peak activity (January – June 2011).
The changes in this case may have been to add redundancy
to the C&C infrastructure as it grew.
These case studies provide three key insights into the
life-cycle of mobile threats. First, in the case of threat ǫ, the
malicious app was not publicly disclosed until months af-
ter its peak activity. In this case, reactive security measures
failed to detect a threat until well after it was most effective.
Second, both of these threats show a growth pattern similar
to those shown in non-mobile malware studies [8]. Third,
4Only the top four ASes are presented; these comprise all hosts for
threat ǫ and 308 out of the 316 hosts used by threat β.
Figure 12: Threat ǫ’s host infrastructure shows agility
comparable to non-mobile botnets
Figure 13: Threat β’s host infrastructure also shows
agility comparable to non-mobile botnets
the agility in the hosting infrastructure used by these threats
does not resemble professional DNS hosting. Rather, they
are similar to non-mobile botnet operators that commonly
use tactics like moving to hosts in different networks and
countries to provide agility to their illicit operations. In fu-
ture work, the agility seen in these mobile threats may be
exploited by traditional DNS reputation systems to detect
potentially suspicious domain names in the mobile space.
6 Related Work
The importance of mobile networks is increasing as
society becomes more reliant on mobile devices such as
smartphones, tablets, and mobile broadband cards. Sev-
eral works have examined mobile device network trafﬁc
to learn about the general network characteristics of those
devices [19, 24, 18]. Past studies have shown that certain
design considerations have made these networks inherently
vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Traynor et
al. [41, 42] proposed a text messaging DoS with only the
bandwidth of a cable modem. This research demonstrated a
growing class of vulnerabilities due to the increasingly in-
tertwined connectivity between the Internet and traditional
voice networks. Other work has shown that the use of data
communication protocols on voice networks creates the po-
tential for failure under modest loads [35, 44, 43, 40]. Ac-
cordingly, signiﬁcant effort has now been directed towards
the analysis of potentially malicious mobile applications.
Numerous studies have highlighted the weaknesses and
potential for misuse of various aspects of the Android se-
curity model [16, 23, 20, 22, 12]. Other work on Android
devices suggests that it is difﬁcult to tell if an application
breaks any phone-wide security policies [17] and has re-
sulted in tools to aid in the analysis of Android applications
[14, 15]. Additional studies have surveyed the types of mal-
ware seen in the wild and evaluated the efﬁcacy of different
techniques in preventing and identifying such threats in the
future [21]. However, app analysis alone provides an in-
complete picture of the current state of malware on mobile
devices and networks.
Network level analysis of malicious behavior offers
a complementary means of characterizing and mitigating
malware. For example, a popular method of preventing or
limiting the spread of malware is the use of Internet black-
lists.
IP blacklists provide a list of known bad actors in
the form of IP addresses which network operators can sub-
sequently block; however, the use of DNS to build mali-
cious network infrastructures has grown due to its resilience
against IP blacklisting [36, 37]. Consequently, a signiﬁcant
amount of work has focused on analyzing those networks at
the DNS level [27, 45, 29, 13, 25]. This has led to the cre-
ation of systems that are able to detect malicious domains
through the use of passive DNS monitoring and machine
learning [7, 10]. Furthermore, recent work has shown that
detection of malicious domains can also be accomplished
by passively monitoring DNS at the upper levels of the DNS
hierarchy; this allows DNS operators to independently de-
tect malicious domains without relying on local recursive
DNS servers [8]. Ultimately, these systems allow network
operators to assemble DNS blacklists of malicious and sus-
picious domains in order to detect and prevent malicious
activity on the network.
Though there has been considerable effort targeted to-
wards detecting network malware, it has been focused pri-
marily on traditional wired networks. The question of
whether such threats differ or even exist in real mobile net-
works has yet to be evaluated through empirical results.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a study of trafﬁc obtained
from a major US cellular provider as well as a major US
non-cellular Internet service provider. Our work provides
an in-depth understanding of the Internet infrastructure used
for mobile malware. In particular, we showed that the net-
work infrastructure used by mobile applications is part of
the core Internet infrastructure used by applications in the
non-cellular world; in other words, the mobile web is part
of the Internet. We presented evidence showing that the
mobile malware discovered by the research community ap-
pears in a minuscule number of devices in the network; this
suggests that mobile application markets are already pro-
viding adequate security for a majority of mobile devices.
We compared trafﬁc to suspicious hosts between different
mobile device platforms and demonstrated that iOS devices
are no less likely than other platforms to reach out to such
devices. Finally, we analyzed two major mobile threats and
found that their network characteristics are similar to those
of non-cellular botnets. Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that
there are commonalities, in terms of both network infras-
tructure and characteristics, between malicious mobile ap-
plications and non-cellular malware. Therefore, we should
leverage our successful experiences with DNS monitoring
and reputation systems for non-cellular ISPs to develop a
similar system for cellular carriers to identify (emerging)
mobile threats. We leave this as a future work.
