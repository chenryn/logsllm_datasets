between having a great plan and executing a great plan. DAMs
should amount to consistent performance and continued suc-
cess on jobs.
OAMs and DAMs Come Together
There is overlap between the two sides no matter how you slice it.
Having them categorized within our minds isn’t important. Look-
ing at the skills and building them up together is the real goal.
Offensive mental skills allow attackers to achieve what most
ordinary people would find hard to believe, never mind actually per-
form. Defensive mental skills give attackers consistency and resil-
iency. The combination of both will result in a powerful attacker,
able to test the most hardened of defenses and also able to provide
solution-b ased feedback for clients left feeling shattered, most often
because they could not have conceived of such an attack mere hours
before it was performed. The performance of an attacker missing
either of these skills will be diminished.
Summary
• OAMs: offensive attacker mindset
• DAMs: defensive attacker mindset
• The offensive attacker mindset allows you to direct an event in
the direction of the objective and be comfortable with the risk
of doing so.
• A defensive attacker mindset will help an attacker win consist-
ently and in all conditions.
• DAMs also teaches you that getting to the root cause of an anx-
ious feeling will help take it from a feeling to a thought that can
be broken down and dealt with and, hopefully, eradicated.
• Whereas your OAMs wants you to pivot at every possible oppor-
tunity that presents itself, your DAMs holds you back when nec-
essary, knowing that not every incident or event is an opportunity
and that observation without action can be just as powerful.
36 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
• Whenever the two are in conflict, OAMs will push you to do
what it takes to win; DAMs will pull you to use caution, urging
you to not take big risks.
• If there’s no life- threatening danger, and you are closing in on
the end of an attack, you should go for the win. If the risk you
need to take in that moment threatens the rest of the engage-
ment, fall back and reassess.
Key Message
Being able to think straight and maintain effective thoughts under
pressure is key when working in a hectic or fluid situation. Prepara-
tion and staying aligned with your goal and adapting to the situa-
tion are critical. Your mental agility is a great asset, as is believing
the attack will never overtake you. You are performing it. You have
as much control as you will ever have. The rest is chance. Find com-
fort in that.
Chapter 3
The Attacker
Mindset Framework
T
he Attacker Mindset Framework (AMsF) is the method and
systematic approach for achieving an objective. It’s the life
cycle model for an attack. The remainder of this book is a
support for this framework. By using the AMsF, you become famil-
iar with building strengths like mental agility, objectivity, and criti-
cal thinking. Through the use of exercises and stories, you start to
think like an attacker.
The AMsF is formed by functionally overlapping elements. The
base elements covered here are development, execution, and ethics,
which are further broken down into their own primary components.
These three groupings are what make up the attacker mentality.
With these at play and executed well, you can probably compro-
mise most businesses worldwide with seemingly devastating results.
Obviously, if you are a malicious attacker, you will likely forgo the
ethics portion and gain similar results but with more risk. As profes-
sional, ethical attackers, we cannot afford to execute without ethics.
The good thing about any framework is that it gives you the
freedom to apply it differently in any circumstance and for any
objective. This framework also allows for individual differences in
effort and execution (see Figure 3.1).

Development
The development phase of the attack cycle leans heavily on the first
four cognitive skills needed to practice this mindset: curiosity, per-
sistence, information gathering, and mental agility.
There is no attack without information. Likewise, without
processing and using the information well and for the good of the
objective, the attack will falter. Looking back to the very first exam-
ple given in Chapter 1, “What Is the Attacker Mindset?,” where a
woman spilled hot coffee on herself and I thought, I bet she was
going over a bump! instead of Oh, she should sue!–information is
critical to the mindset and the direction you take as an attacker, and
so is how you process it. Had I known that McDonald’s was heating
coffee perpetually at 180–190° F, and that coffee at that tempera-
ture, if spilled, causes third- degree burns in 3 to 7 seconds, I’d have
known how to get approximately $3 million in putative damages
from McDonald’s. I didn’t have that information. And more impor-
tant, I didn’t think to look for it. I was not at all curious about the
coffee or any information to do with it. I was only focused on the
woman. Worse still, I went with what I thought I knew, which is
that it’s not anyone else’s fault if you single-h andedly spill coffee on
yourself (speed bump or no speed bump). This thought process in
and of itself highlights two interesting points. The first is that this is
a sort of bias that we all fall victim to and must fight hard not to. It
takes a lot not to operate from bias because it is most often invisible
to the operator in every way.
The particular bias I was suffering from is known as anchoring
bias; I relied too much on one key piece of information and the first
piece I received. I also fell victim to the illusion of validity, which
meant I overestimated the accuracy of my own perception and judg-
ment. These examples are two of a huge number of cognitive biases
that hamper critical thinking and, as a result, the validity of our
decisions and stances on things. This neatly plays into the second
thing of note, which is that it is always best to get a good picture of
both sides of the story— for instance, finding out the temperature
of the coffee.
40 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
There’s another, darker side to be considered with regard to
information weaponization for the good of the objective. To explore
it, we must look at the world of spies. Ana Montes was a prolific
and damaging Cuban spy. But to those she was deceiving, she was
thought of as a star. She had been selected, repeatedly, for promo-
tions and showered with honors, accolades, and even a medal from
the CIA. One of Montes’s former supervisors even described her
as the best employee he had ever had.
She was a Cuban analyst, what is known as a GS-1 4. But she
was also on the clock for Fidel Castro for her nearly 20- year career.
For the entire time, she passed along secrets about her colleagues,
she spied on the American spies working against Cuba, and she
leaked classified US military information frequently. Moreover, she
manages to blindside her brother Tito, an FBI special agent; her for-
mer boyfriend, Roger Corneretto, an intelligence officer for the Pen-
tagon specializing in Cuba; and her sister Lucy, a 28- year veteran of
the FBI who has won awards for helping to unmask Cuban spies.
Montes never removed any documents from work, nor did she send
them digitally. Instead, she kept the details in her head and simply
typed them up at home. She would then relocate the information
onto encrypted disks, meet with her handler, and turn them over.
But what did she do from an attacker mindset point of view?
Well, she stuck to all four laws and used all the skills. Montes most
certainly had an end in mind; it was believed to be a shared end
between her and her employers and her country to a degree; she
weaponized information and applied it to the objective time and
time again. She weaponized information she got from being on the
inside and applied it to her own objective. She altered other infor-
mation so that it could not be properly weaponized by those who
believed her to be working along with them.
All of that is a given, and it was not easily detectable by her
peers because they all thought, and Montes seemed to be, working
from the same scope for the same objective. Her real power came from
the fact she never broke character. If she had, for even a second,
she would’ve been in jail a lot sooner. Her duplicitous game meant
everyone thought she was working for the same goal they were, and
The Attacker Mindset Framework 41
because she continuously bent the information to her own objective
without breaking character, she was able to deliberately distort the
US government’s views on Cuba. Her pretext was not for the good
of everyone else’s goal. It was only to disguise her as a threat from it.
Eventually, though, Montes did break character and took actions
that could not be aligned with the mission she was supposed to be
working on. In other words, she acted in a way that was not con-
gruent with the American objective. She deviated from the normal
course of action and acted in a way that benefited her own objective.
In 2001, an analyst at the National Security Agency (NSA)
approached Scott Carmichael, a counterintelligence officer, with
sensitive information: the NSA had intercepted and made sense
of a coded Cuban communication. It revealed a prominent Wash-
ington figure who was secretly working for Cuba. They called this
person Agent S and noted that this double agent had interests in
the ‘Support for Analysts File Environment’ (SAFE) system and had
traveled to Guantanamo Bay in July 1996. (SAFE was the computer
system of the Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA]). Carmichael
cross- referenced any DIA employees who had traveled to Guanta-
namo Bay in July 1996, and a familiar name came up: Ana Montes.
Consequently, Montes is in jail at the highest- security wom-
en’s prison in the nation. She’s shared a home with a woman who
strangled a pregnant woman to get her baby, a nurse who killed
four patients with massive injections of adrenaline, and a former
Charles Manson groupie who tried to assassinate President Gerald
Ford. Montes took actions that were outside the scope of what was
best for her seeming objective, and it was an immediate red flag.
Law 4— everything you do as an attacker must be for the good of
the objective— will always out a traitor or someone detrimental to
the mission because at certain points they will have to choose their
true objective over the one they are pretending to act on behalf of.
Stepping out of the world of spies and infiltrators, I come back
to information. Information is the lifeblood of any operation, and so
knowing how to collect and process it is integral to achieving and
using the mindset. In this beginning phase of the attack, you gather
information, assess that information, and categorize it into one of
42 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
three classes: useful from a pretext standpoint, useful for the actual
attack insofar as helping to achieve the objective, or not useful at all
(to be disregarded). Learning new ways to process, follow, and apply
information becomes easier with practice. This is development, and
it’s the first major piece of the AMsF.
The development of an attack can be split into two subcatego-
ries. The first is assessing information, and the second is creating
vulnerabilities from it. Achieving this involves processing the infor-
mation and mental agility.
The ability to assess a business’s vulnerabilities through your
AMs lens means parsing seemingly innocuous information to help
form an attack. Examples of this apparently mundane information
are things like job postings for the company that specify particu-
lar systems and software used; pictures of office space and lists of
upcoming events that employees will attend, or even those that they
have attended in the past; and even social media postings allowing
insight into the culture of the place. One of the best places to look
for information on a company is on sites that allow employees to
critique their place of employment. Of course, not all information
is seemingly innocuous, but if you happen across information that
is crippling (aside from reporting it to your point of contact pretty
pronto), you have to be able to use it in a way that’s not tactless or
revealing about your motives. Examples of this would be finding
that the domain controller is on the demilitarized zone (DMZ) or
that an employee has accidentally posted a picture with the com-
pany credit card displayed. In both cases, you would have to operate
with discipline and control. In both cases, you would quickly have
to inform your point of contact.
The development stage also involves creating vulnerabilities
from information for the same outcome. Usually, development
means starting to build a pretext, which is typically the first step in
an attack’s formation. In the next section, brilliantly titled “Phase
1,” I will look at an example of a case in which a pretext is developed
from apparently harmless information.
As a helpful aside so that you aren’t blindsided later, I further
categorize useful information into two classifications: advantageous
The Attacker Mindset Framework 43
and elite. Advantageous information is made up of items that can
help us but that can change at any time. An example is a company’s
leadership, software used, or a vendor. Advantageous data is typi-
cally stable, but it’s not elite. Elite information doesn’t change over
the course of its lifetime, unless the company is sold or acquired.
Other examples include the company’s Employer Identification
Number (EIN); its core services, profits, and losses each year; and
other historical information.
When we’re attacking a person, an example of elite information
would be health data, such as blood type and mental conditions. We
live in an age of genetic sequencing, whereby the best of current-
day science tells us that all humans are 99% alike and that only 1%
of DNA accounts for our differences. In other words, your DNA
is responsible for your psychological traits and personality; it can
reveal your mental illnesses and abilities. Behavioral problems show
great genetic influence, too. This puts elite data in a category entirely
of its own. With the rise of personal genomics, a person’s mental
strengths and weaknesses can be predicted from birth. That’s valu-
able information, and it is available to us now as attackers.
Advantageous information would be a person’s address and
their email. Typically passwords change over time, too.
This level of categorization is not needed, but you might find
it helpful to label things this way, depending on how detail ori-
ented you are and if categorizing things this way is beneficial to
your client.
Phase 1
The first phase of development concentrates its efforts on sifting
through broad and voluminous information without any direc-
tion. The searches you perform and the information you gather will
obviously pertain to the target, but it won’t all be in the same cat-
egory. As an example, you might collect information on the public
appearance of the company, the services they provide, the hierar-
chy, and other even simpler information, like the address of their
headquarters or if they sponsor employee events. Gathering all this
44 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
information and sorting it into categories will allow you to hone
your avenue of attack and gather more information to design and
craft a pretext in the second phase of development.
