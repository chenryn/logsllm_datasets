will occupy the RF channel once the IoT relay starts stream-
ing. However, it only occupies 8 kHz bandwidth, far smaller
than the 26 MHz channel in the 900 MHz ISM band. Further,
covering an area requires few relays (3 for any horizontal
noise source direction, 4 for any 3D direction), hence, the
total bandwidth occupied remains a small fraction. Even
with multiple co-located users, channel contention can be
addressed by carrier-sensing and channel allocation.
7 RELATED WORK
The literature in acoustics and active noise control is ex-
tremely rich, with connections to various sub-fields of engi-
neering [20, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 39, 49, 51]. In the interest of
space, we directly zoom into two directions closest to MUTE:
wireless ANC, and ANC with lookahead.
Wireless ANC: An RF control plane has been proposed in
the context of multi-processor ANC, mainly to cope with
various sound sources in large spaces [23, 26–29, 34]. In
this body of work, distributed DSP processors communicate
between themselves over wired/wireless links to achieve
real-time, distributed, noise cancellation. The notion of “pig-
gybacking” sound over RF, to exploit the propagation delay
difference, is not a focus in these systems. Moreover, most
of the mentioned systems are via simulations [23, 26–28].
ANC with Lookahead: Certain car models [1–3] and air-
planes [7, 8] implement ANC inside their cabins – reference
microphones are placed near the engine and connected via
wires to the DSP devices. While this offers promising looka-
head, observe that the problems of inverse-channel estima-
tion are almost absent, since the noise source positions are
known, the noise signal is well structured, and the acoustic
channel is stable. Moreover, these systems have no notion of
at-ear feedback (from headphone microphones), since they
are canceling broadly around the passenger’s head locations.
This is the reason why cancellation is feasible only at very
low frequencies (<100 Hz in Honda vehicles [2]). In contrast,
MUTE introduces wireless forwarding, embeds lookahead-
awareness in the ANC pipeline, and integrates a personal
architecture for 4 kHz cancellation. Said differently, the in-
tersection of “personal” ANC and “wireless” lookahead is
both technically and architecturally new, to the best of our
knowledge.
The idea of sound forwarding over RF has been applied
to very different contexts, such as acoustic communication
across sound-proof boundaries [37], wireless acoustic MIMO
and beamforming [19], and even walkie-talkies and wireless
microphones [16, 17]. However, they are not aimed towards
noise cancellation. Finally, we should mention that some
systems have leveraged the propagation delay difference be-
tween RF and sound, albeit for other applications. Cricket
[44], AHLoS [48], and Dolphin [40] have all used the Time-
of-Arrival (ToA) difference between RF and sound for rang-
ing and localization. [50] uses RF signals as a tool to avoid
acoustic collision in wireless sensor networks. Overall, this
is similar to how earthquake and tsunami sensors [11, 12]
work, by utilizing the fact that wireless signals travel much
faster than ocean waves and tectonic vibrations.
8 CONCLUSION
This paper exploits the velocity gap between RF and sound to
improve active noise cancellation. By anticipating the sound
milliseconds in advance, our proposed system is able to com-
pute the anti-noise signal in time, better estimate sound
channels, and ultimately attain wider-band cancellation. In
addition, the core idea opens a number of architectural possi-
bilities at the intersection of wireless networks and acoustic
sensing. This paper is a first step towards these directions.
