User: I want to run a script that contains some commands to execute for eg: pwd, xterm home, date, time Here i want to run the script which executes pwd in first terminal, and creates a xterm home then in xterm home terminal i want to run date and time command then i want to run once again pwd in main terminal.
"How to switch between the terminals in a python script ?"
Thanks n Regards

Assistant: Have your script myscript.py take an optional argument e.g. other_term.  Spawn xterm -e myscript.py other_term.  When the second instance of myscript.py starts, check for the optional argument other_term; if present, perform the second set of commands.  Use environment variables or files or command line arguments or pipes to transfer any required state between the first (initial) and second (other_term) instances. When the other_term instance finishes, the second xterm will automatically close and return control to the first (intial) instance which can then proceed with its commands.  If you do NOT want the second xterm to close then spawn xterm -e asynchronously and do NOT let your other_term script exit; have it signal instead (e.g. via a semaphore file or, if you know how to do it, via pipe -- xterm does not close filehandles) to the first instance that the first instance can resume, and e.g. wait for user confirmation before exiting on both scripts.
