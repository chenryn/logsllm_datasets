Subject: Switching Between Terminals in a Python Script

Dear Vasantkumar,

Thank you for your inquiry. To achieve the desired functionality, you can create a Python script that spawns an `xterm` window and executes specific commands in both the main terminal and the new `xterm` window. Here is a step-by-step approach to accomplish this:

1. **Create the Python Script (myscript.py):**
   - The script will take an optional argument to differentiate between the main instance and the `xterm` instance.
   - Use the `subprocess` module to spawn the `xterm` and execute commands.

2. **Main Instance Execution:**
   - Execute the `pwd` command in the main terminal.
   - Spawn an `xterm` with the script, passing the `other_term` argument.
   - After the `xterm` instance finishes, execute `pwd` again in the main terminal.

3. **Xterm Instance Execution:**
   - Check for the `other_term` argument.
   - If the argument is present, execute the `date` and `time` commands in the `xterm`.

Here is a sample implementation of the script:

```python
import sys
import subprocess
import os

def main():
    if 'other_term' in sys.argv:
        # This is the xterm instance
        print("Running in xterm:")
        subprocess.run(['date'])
        subprocess.run(['time'])
    else:
        # This is the main instance
        print("Running in main terminal:")
        subprocess.run(['pwd'])

        # Spawn xterm with the script and pass the other_term argument
        xterm_command = ['xterm', '-e', 'python3', 'myscript.py', 'other_term']
        subprocess.run(xterm_command)

        # Wait for the xterm to close and then run pwd again in the main terminal
        print("Back in main terminal:")
        subprocess.run(['pwd'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **Main Instance:**
  - The script first checks if the `other_term` argument is present. If not, it runs `pwd` in the main terminal.
  - It then spawns an `xterm` with the same script, passing the `other_term` argument.
  - After the `xterm` closes, it runs `pwd` again in the main terminal.

- **Xterm Instance:**
  - The script checks for the `other_term` argument. If present, it runs `date` and `time` in the `xterm`.

### Notes:
- Ensure that `xterm` is installed on your system.
- The `subprocess.run` function is used to execute the commands. You can use `subprocess.Popen` for more control over the process, especially if you need to handle asynchronous execution.
