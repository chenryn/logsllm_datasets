User: What is port scanning and what is its role in network security?
Assistant: Port scanning is a technique to search for available communication ports on the network. In a computer network, each application is bound to a specific port, for example, HTTP services are usually bound to port 80, FTP services are usually bound to port 21, and so on. By scanning the ports of a target host, an attacker can determine which applications or services it is running and use this information to attack it. In network security, port scanning can be used to test network security to identify possible security holes and weaknesses. By checking open ports on network devices, administrators can ensure that only ports that need to be accessed are open and unauthorized ports are closed. Also, for security teams, port scanning is a way to monitor network traffic and activity.
