User: I have no idea why python run every script in a new command window. 
For example I run: python testfile.py, it is show new window and close immediately, so I can't look the traceback. 
Python 2.7 32-bit at the same machine works normally
Assistant: You can run it through IDLE, the built-in editor. It may not be much helpful if you have to provide command-line args.
An alternate option may be making the code wait for a keypress using raw_input(), as Insidi0us said.
You can also print the errors to a file.
Another option may be running the command prompt first, then run python command (make sure your environment variable contains the python installation directory).
