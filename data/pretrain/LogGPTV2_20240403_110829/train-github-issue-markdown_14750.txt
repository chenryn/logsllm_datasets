I have an account on your site and have successfully added GitHub, Twitter, and Google+ to my profile. However, I am experiencing an issue when attempting to add LinkedIn. After logging in and authorizing Free Code Camp, nothing happensâ€”the dialog simply closes. It appears that the problem is on your end, as the authorization process does not complete. Additionally, when I click the button in the future, no dialog box appears, suggesting that the system thinks it has already been authorized.

Could you please look into this and assist me with adding LinkedIn to my profile? Thank you.
