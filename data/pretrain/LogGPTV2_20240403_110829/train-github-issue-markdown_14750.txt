I've got an account on your site and I've successfully added GitHub, Twitter
and G+ to my profile, but when I try to add LinkedIn, nothing happens once
I've logged in and authorized Free Code Camp. The problem seems to be on your
side as the dialog closes after attempting to authorize and when the button is
clicked in the future no dialog box pops up as it's already been authorised.
