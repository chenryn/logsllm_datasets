### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
I see npm is using project specific repositories containing the libraries used
in the particular project. The issue is this creates duplicate library files
for the ones used in multiple projects as Angular/react framework libraries.
This effectively creates disk space issue in case you are working on multiple
projects common for most enterprise developers. Also, long download time.
In sense there is already mature maven ecosystem that already solves this
problem by using local central repository containing **versioned** libraries
and than each project can refer to the library version that it needs. This
saves lot of disc space.
In sense version conflicts should not be the reason, you can maintain
versioned dependencies. I guess the problem is solved by yarn. I am new to npm
ecosystem request help here.
### Expected Behavior
Use central local repositories that contain versioned libraries and refer
those in project -- Maven like
### Steps To Reproduce
npx create-react-app my-app
creates local node modules folder with all app dependencies.
### Environment
  * npm:
  * Node.js:
  * OS Name: Windows

    ; node bin location = C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
    ; cwd = C:\Users\ABC
    ; HOME = C:\Users\ABC
    ; "npm config ls -l" to show all defaults.
