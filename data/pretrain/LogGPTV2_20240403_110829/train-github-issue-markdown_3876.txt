Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to all the Bootstrap 3 developers for their outstanding work.

Regarding the icon system, Bootstrap 3.0 transitioned from using "icon- _" to "glyphicon glyphicon- _". As mentioned in issue #10201 (comment):

> The primary reason for this change is performance. In larger projects, attribute selectors used in 2.x versions are not as efficient. Classes, on the other hand, offer better performance. This change also aligns with our approach of using base and modifier classes throughout the project.

Additionally, in issue #8332 ("Remove Glyphicons"), the following points were highlighted:
1. It makes Glyphicons more accessible to a broader audience, whether or not they use Bootstrap.
2. It keeps the core project leaner by reducing the number of files, build processes, and versioning.
3. It allows the community to easily switch between different icon libraries.

The first objective is to improve performance, which is achieved through the use of a base class and a modifier class. The second objective is to facilitate the easy swapping of different icon libraries. However, incorporating the product name "glyphicon" into the class names works against this goal. It strengthens the association between Bootstrap 3 and Glyphicons, creating significant challenges for both providers of icon sets and users who wish to use alternative icon sets.

For more details, please refer to FortAwesome/Font-Awesome#940 (comment).

To address these issues, I propose using "icon" as the base class and "icon-" as the prefix for modifier classes (or perhaps "bs-icon" and "bs-icon-"). This approach would help avoid many of the problems associated with the current naming convention.

I respectfully request that the Bootstrap developers consider no longer using the product name of a specific icon set as the default class name in Bootstrap. Is there anyone who supports this suggestion? Please add your vote if you agree.

P.S. I apologize for any errors in my English; I am still working on improving my language skills with the help of a dictionary.
