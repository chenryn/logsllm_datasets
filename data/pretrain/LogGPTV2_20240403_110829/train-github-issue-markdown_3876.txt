At first. Thank you all the Bootstrap 3 developers for your great work.
For icons, Bootstrap 3.0 switched from "icon- _" to "glyphicon" "glyphicon-_
".

So the first target is better performance. We get it by using base class and a
modifier class.
And the second target is more easily swap other icon libraries.
Using the product name "glyphicon" in the class names work against this!
It links bootstrap 3 stronger to glyphicon as ever before. It brings a lot of
trouble and only ugly solutions for providers of icon sets and also for users
of icon set.
See here for details: FortAwesome/Font-Awesome#940 (comment)
But why?
Using "icon" as base class and "icon-" as prefix for modifier classes (or may
be "bs-icon" and "bs-icon-") would avoid many of these problems.
I beg of you the bootstrap developers, do not longer take a product name of a
special icon set as default class name in bootstrap.
Is there anybody who support this wish?  
Please add a vote.
