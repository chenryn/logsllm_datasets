# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Well I did not see it suggested before so I would create a ticket for it  
This is mostly as most game would used modifier keys (Ctrl,Alt,Shift) and
depend on keyboard layout, Win key might be close to it and accidentally
trigger would be costly in game.
# Solution
So I would request either disable it or rebind it per focused app to non-
interrupt combo like Home/End as those would mostly process if in-game chat
was open  
I still debate on if we still trigger like normal if it was Win+XXX Combo.
Like Win+1 might be accident of Ctrl+1.  
I understand that this is wait on per app binding feature.
