### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:06:16 to 18:06:21 on 10-18, highlights several recurring issues and events related to resource management and lease renewal in a Hadoop environment. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues:**
   - At 18:06:16 and 18:06:18, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` component encountered errors while trying to contact the Resource Manager (RM). The log entries indicate that there was an "ERROR IN CONTACTING RM."
   - The system attempted to retry the connection to the server `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of up to 10 attempts, each with a 1-second interval.

2. **Address Changes:**
   - Multiple address changes were detected for both the RM and the NameNode (NN) at different timestamps:
     - For the RM, the address changed from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030` at 18:06:17, 18:06:19, and 18:06:21.
     - For the NameNode, the address changed from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000` at 18:06:16, 18:06:18, 18:06:19, and 18:06:20.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component failed to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` multiple times:
     - At 18:06:16, it failed for 79 seconds.
     - At 18:06:18, it failed for 80 seconds.
     - At 18:06:19, it failed for 81 seconds.
     - At 18:06:20, it failed for 82 seconds.
     - At 18:06:21, it failed for 83 seconds.
   - Each failure was followed by a message indicating that the system will retry shortly.

4. **Task Progress Reports:**
   - At 18:06:18, the progress of two task attempts was reported:
     - `TaskAttempt attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000001_0` had a progress of 0.37551183.
     - `TaskAttempt attempt_1445144423722_0020_m_000002_0` had a progress of 0.38137424.

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing issues with connecting to the Resource Manager and renewing leases, likely due to address changes. The system is attempting to handle these issues by retrying connections and lease renewals, but the problems persist. Additionally, the progress of specific tasks is being monitored and reported.
