I recently upgraded to the latest version of numpy (1.18.1) and matplotlib
(3.2.1). My python script was performing fine prior to the upgrade and now,
it's hit with error messages. I'm running on python version 3.7.7. Below is
the error message.
### Error message:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
