I recently upgraded to the latest versions of NumPy (1.18.1) and Matplotlib (3.2.1). My Python script was running smoothly before the upgrade, but now it is encountering error messages. I am using Python 3.7.7. Below is the error message:

### Error Message:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\numpy\core\function_base.py", line 117, in linspace
    num = operator.index(num)
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):

    .format(type(num)))
TypeError: object of type <class 'float'> cannot be safely interpreted as an integer.
```

### Analysis and Suggestion:
The error message indicates that the `linspace` function in NumPy is receiving a float value where it expects an integer. This is likely due to one of the bin numbers (`NGbinNum` or `PSDbinNum`) being a float instead of an integer.

To resolve this issue, ensure that `NGbinNum` and `PSDbinNum` are integers. You can convert them to integers using the `int()` function. For example:

```python
NGbinNum = int(NGbinNum)
PSDbinNum = int(PSDbinNum)

h, xh, yh = np.histogram2d(totals, psd, (NGbinNum, PSDbinNum), range=[x_range, y_range])
```

This should resolve the `TypeError` and allow your script to run correctly with the updated libraries.
