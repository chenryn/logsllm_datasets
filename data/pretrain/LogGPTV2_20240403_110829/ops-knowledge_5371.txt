User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Ubuntu MongoDB server not responding? I have amazon aws ubuntu 18.04 server 8GB RAM and 50GB Storage. I have installed MongoDB 4.2 and Node JS 12 LTS.
In current server has 30 GB MongoDB storage. I have 4 micro service on same server. I have installed pm2 to start all 4 services.
Don't know why my all services responds delay.
For example:
I have checked pm2 start 0 it takes 4-5 mins to show logs.
I have already remove db caching and flush pm2 logs. But still mongodb service takes 50% CPU usage.
I have checked all code and found there is no 3rd party APIs call and optimize all queries and adding indexing on server. But still server taking too much times.
Most of time I got server timeout error. Please assist me. How to make my server fast.

Assistant: TL;DR: I recently troubleshoot a node server that was trying to resolve names on IPv6 before falling back to IPv4, and this was the solution to my problem (YMMV):
Try the following:

Open Terminal

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and open the configuration file and add the following lines at the end


net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1


Type command sudo sysctl -p you will see this in terminal.

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1


After that run $ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6 - If it reports 1 means you have disabled IPV6.

Restart your node server.
