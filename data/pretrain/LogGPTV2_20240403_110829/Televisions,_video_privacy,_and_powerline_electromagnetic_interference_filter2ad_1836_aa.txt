ABSTRACT
We conduct an extensive study of information leakage over
the powerline infrastructure from eight televisions (TVs)
spanning multiple makes, models, and underlying technolo-
gies. In addition to being of scientiﬁc interest, our ﬁndings
contribute to the overall debate of whether or not measure-
ments of residential powerlines reveal signiﬁcant information
about the activities within a home. We ﬁnd that the power
supplies of modern TVs produce discernible electromagnetic
interference (EMI) signatures that are indicative of the video
content being displayed. We measure the stability of these
signatures over time and across multiple instances of the
same TV model, as well as the robustness of these signatures
in the presence of other noisy electronic devices connected to
the same powerline.

INTRODUCTION
It is known that consumer electronic devices can leak some
information over powerlines, such as whether a particular
device is on or oﬀ [10, 23], or even information about speciﬁc
keystrokes on a keyboard [3, 28]. However, this knowledge

is limited. In many cases, when faced with a given technol-
ogy and asked whether it leaks private information over the
powerline, our only possible answer is either a “maybe” or
a “probably.” The device probably leaks information about
whether it is on or oﬀ. It might also leak more ﬁne-grained
information, but exactly what information we do not know.
Moreover, even if we can make an educated guess that a
device might leak some particular form of information, we do
not know how stable that information leakage channel is over
time or over multiple instances of the same technology, nor
how robust that information leakage is against interference
from other devices connected to the same powerline.
In tandem with the above observations, we ﬁnd that nu-
merous technologies are being developed that will measure
information from residential powerlines. For example, utility
(power) companies are seeking to deploy smart meters that
measure ﬁne-grained power usage for billing and demand-
prediction [27], and ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) sys-
tems similarly measure the powerline for activity recognition
purposes [10, 11, 23]. Future versions of these technolo-
gies may measure even more information. Returning to the
above-mentioned information leakage knowledge gap, there is
enough information today for privacy advocates to argue that
these powerline measurement should be treated as private [20],
thus motivating proposed policy changes, recommendations
to industry, and research on privacy-preserving mechanisms
for powerline measurements (e.g., [24]). Those opposed to
these recommendations argue that the privacy concerns are
overinﬂated. Unfortunately, the existence of the knowledge
gap means that both sides of the debate are proceeding with
incomplete knowledge and hence positions based in part on
conjecture. Thus, in addition to being of scientiﬁc interest,
new research is needed to inform this debate.
While it is infeasible to completely close this knowledge
gap and study all electronic devices and root out all pow-
erline information leakage channels, it is feasible — even if
daunting — to rigorously and extensively study individual
artifacts or classes of artifacts. For this study, we choose
to focus extensively on one of the most ubiquitous classes
of consumer electronic devices: modern televisions (TVs).
We choose TVs, rather than toasters or ovens, because TVs
have complex internal states — functions of the screen con-
tent being displayed — and thus present the potential for rich
information leakage.
Separately, our choice of TVs was driven by the legal
status of TVs and video viewing habits. Speciﬁcally, the
U.S. Video Protection Privacy Act of 1998 states that an

individual’s video viewing records must be kept conﬁdential.
Any research ﬁnding to the contrary — that a measurements
of a home’s powerline could reveal private information about
someone’s video viewing habits — could thus have signiﬁcant
legal ramiﬁcations.
For breadth and depth, we obtained a collection of eight
TVs spanning three manufacturers (Panasonic, Samsung,
1
and Sharp),
two technologies (LCD and Plasma), and three
sizes (32”, 42”, and 58”); see Table 1. We repeatedly played
video sequences on each of these TVs while recording the
electromagnetic interference (EMI) that these TVs produced
as measured on the powerlines; we obtained these measure-
ments using a separate single sensor attached to the same
powerline, though explicitly not between the TV and the
powerline itself. Our sensor’s access to the powerline thus
matches the access aﬀorded to any other consumer electronic
plugged in somewhere within a home. We analyzed the EMI
in the frequency domain. We obtained initial measurements
in a clean laboratory setting, and then collected further mea-
surements in unrestricted home environments with diverse
collections of other noisy electronics attached to the same
powerline.
We ﬁnd that all but the Sharp 32
TVs produce a signiﬁ-
cant amount of stable, robust information leakage over the
(cid:2)(cid:2)
powerline via EMI. As an example, for the Panasonic 42
TVs in a laboratory setting, we ﬁnd that we can correctly
match a random 15 minute EMI trace from a movie to a
database of EMI signatures totaling 1200 movie minutes 96%
of the time (the remaining 4% were below our matching
threshold, not incorrectly matched); the hit rate drops to
92% in noisy home environments. More broadly, we sought
to develop an infrastructure capable of exploring answers to
the following ﬁve questions:
(cid:2)(cid:2)
• Do TVs of diﬀerent makes, models, and technologies
produce repeatable EMI, when given repeated screen
content?
• Does diﬀerent screen content produce diﬀerentiable
EMI from a given TV?
• Is EMI consistent across multiple instances of TVs from
the same model family?
• Can we determine if someone is watching a particular
video by matching an EMI sample to a database of EMI
signatures?

We do not have any reason to believe that our results are
speciﬁc to these manufacturers.
• Can we match EMI recorded in a lab setting to EMI
extracted in homes, especially when those homes might
have a diverse array of other consumer electronics con-
nected to the same powerline?
In general, we ﬁnd that we are able to answer all these
questions aﬃrmatively, though with some caveats and clariﬁ-
cations, e.g., clariﬁcations on what it means for an EMI trace
to be “repeatable” or “consistent” and weaker results with the
Sharp 32
TVs. Although explicitly not our primary goal,
we also sought to conduct a preliminary investigation into
the following question:
(cid:2)(cid:2)
• Can we learn to predict what EMI a TV would produce
given only screen content, i.e., without previous EMI
traces for that TV model when displaying the content
in question?
To summarize, our primary contribution is an extensive
study of powerline EMI information leakage from a diverse
collection of modern TVs, as well as the discovery that signif-
icant, stable, and robust information is, in fact, leaked from
these devices. Fortunately, from a privacy perspective, we
also observe that today’s utility companies are not collecting
the granularity of information necessary for repeating our
analyses, and the ubicomp technologies from the research
community that could collect this type of information are
not yet widely deployed. Nevertheless, these technologies are
surprisingly near-term, e.g., smart meters exist today that
report samples at 1 Hz but collect measurements at 3 kHz [7]
(our approach in contrast samples at 500 kHz and uses mea-
surements at 2 Hz) and we anticipate higher sampling rates
in the near future.
Although these emerging technologies enable important
applications, we stress here that the policies enacted today
could help inform future utility and ubicomp deployments,
and hence we argue that it is important to understand these
ﬁndings today, before new technologies in or attached to
the home begin to collect and store ﬁne-grained powerline
measurements at a large scale.
2. TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS
Modern consumer electronics utilize switched mode power
supplies (SMPS), which are increasingly employed due to
their higher eﬃciency and smaller form factor. Energy Star
even mandates the use of this kind of power supply for most
consumer electronic devices. We anticipate that the preva-
lence of SMPS will only increase as hardware manufacturers
face continued pressure from political and market forces de-
manding higher levels of eﬃciency and miniaturization. The
materials described here are either known or easily inferred
from past work and an understanding of how electrical devices
operate, e.g., [10].
SMPS as EMI Sources. Despite the advantages SMPS
provide, one side eﬀect of SMPS’s operation is that they
inadvertently produce electromagnetic interference (EMI).
The EMI is a consequence of the voltage conversion method
that SMPS employ and it’s characteristics are proportional
to the rate at which the conversion in the power supply takes
place. This rate, also known as the switching frequency, is
dynamically adjusted to meet the power requirements of the
appliance driven by the SMPS. In sum, the changing power
demands of an electronic device cause dynamic adjustments
to the SMPS’s switching frequency which in turn modulates
538• The EMI signature of each device is centered around
the switching frequency of its power supply; diﬀerent de-
vices often occupy distinct frequency ranges allowing for
their noise signals to coexist with minimal interference.
However signal overlap is possible, and increasingly
likely if many active devices share the same powerline.
• Changes in EMI can manifest in frequency shifts, energy
density changes, or both. These properties are visible
in Figure 1 as the TV exhibits frequency shift EMI,
while the washer signal produces density changes.

electrical appliances in the home. Washer cycle on
(1) and oﬀ (2). CFL lamp turning oﬀ brieﬂy (3) and
then on (4). Note that the TV’s (Sharp 42” LCD)
EMI shifts in frequency, which happens as screen
content changes.
Note that EMI signals vary as a function of the operation of
the device, e.g., washer EMI increases in energy density when
the barrel is rotated during the spin cycle, and TV EMI is
modulated in frequency as the screen content changes. We
explore this phenomenon more deeply in our investigations
below.
the EMI signal. To prevent high levels of inadvertent EMI
from adversely inﬂuencing the operation of neighboring de-
vices, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the
U.S. limits the amount of interference that a device can emit
to -40dBm for the frequency range of 1–500 kHz (47CFR part
15/18 Consumer Emission Limits); however the regulation
threshold is weak from an information leakage perspective
since EMI measurements can be accurately done using inex-
pensive hardware (the circuit we describe is sensitive to -100
dBm).
Noise Propagation.
The EMI generated by SMPS de-
vices is coupled onto the powerline and propagates throughout
the electric infrastructure (i.e., a home) while retaining its
signal qualities. In our tests we were able to capture robust
signals several hundred feet away from the EMI source. We
leverage this property and demonstrate that a single sensor
anywhere along a home’s powerline (including outdoor out-
lets) can observe the conducted EMI signals from numerous
connected SMPS-based devices.
The raw signals we gather with

our powerline interface (PLI) (detailed in Section 5) are
not particularly meaningful unless analyzed in the frequency
domain. To transform the signal from a sequence of data
points in time to a set of energies at various frequencies,
we digitize the analog readings and compute a Fast Fourier
Transform (described in detail later in the paper). The goal
of these engineering operations is to allow us to analyze
EMI ﬂuctuations as changes in power over frequency space
(visualized in Figure 1).

a typical home; note the rich information landscape which
