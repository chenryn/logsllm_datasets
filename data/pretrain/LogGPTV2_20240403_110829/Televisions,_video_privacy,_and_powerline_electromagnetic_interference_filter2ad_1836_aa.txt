## Abstract
We conducted an extensive study on information leakage over powerline infrastructure from eight televisions (TVs) spanning multiple makes, models, and underlying technologies. Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate about whether residential powerline measurements reveal significant information about activities within a home. We discovered that the power supplies of modern TVs produce discernible electromagnetic interference (EMI) signatures indicative of the video content being displayed. We measured the stability of these signatures over time and across multiple instances of the same TV model, as well as their robustness in the presence of other noisy electronic devices connected to the same powerline.

## 1. Introduction
It is known that consumer electronic devices can leak information over powerlines, such as whether a particular device is on or off [10, 23], or even specific keystrokes on a keyboard [3, 28]. However, this knowledge is limited. In many cases, when faced with a given technology and asked whether it leaks private information over the powerline, our only possible answer is either a "maybe" or a "probably." The device probably leaks information about whether it is on or off. It might also leak more fine-grained information, but exactly what information we do not know. Moreover, even if we can make an educated guess that a device might leak some particular form of information, we do not know how stable that information leakage channel is over time or over multiple instances of the same technology, nor how robust that information leakage is against interference from other devices connected to the same powerline.

In tandem with the above observations, numerous technologies are being developed to measure information from residential powerlines. For example, utility companies are deploying smart meters that measure fine-grained power usage for billing and demand prediction [27], and ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) systems measure the powerline for activity recognition purposes [10, 11, 23]. Future versions of these technologies may measure even more information. Given the current information, privacy advocates argue that these powerline measurements should be treated as private [20], motivating proposed policy changes, recommendations to industry, and research on privacy-preserving mechanisms for powerline measurements (e.g., [24]). Those opposed to these recommendations argue that the privacy concerns are overinflated. Unfortunately, the existence of the knowledge gap means that both sides of the debate are proceeding with incomplete knowledge and hence positions based in part on conjecture. Thus, new research is needed to inform this debate.

While it is infeasible to completely close this knowledge gap and study all electronic devices, it is feasible to rigorously and extensively study individual artifacts or classes of artifacts. For this study, we focused on one of the most ubiquitous classes of consumer electronic devices: modern televisions (TVs). We chose TVs because they have complex internal states, which are functions of the screen content being displayed, and thus present the potential for rich information leakage.

Additionally, our choice of TVs was driven by the legal status of TVs and video viewing habits. Specifically, the U.S. Video Protection Privacy Act of 1998 states that an individual's video viewing records must be kept confidential. Any research finding that powerline measurements could reveal private information about someone’s video viewing habits could have significant legal ramifications.

For breadth and depth, we obtained a collection of eight TVs spanning three manufacturers (Panasonic, Samsung, and Sharp), two technologies (LCD and Plasma), and three sizes (32", 42", and 58"); see Table 1. We repeatedly played video sequences on each of these TVs while recording the electromagnetic interference (EMI) that these TVs produced as measured on the powerlines. We obtained these measurements using a separate single sensor attached to the same powerline, though explicitly not between the TV and the powerline itself. Our sensor’s access to the powerline matches the access afforded to any other consumer electronic plugged in somewhere within a home. We analyzed the EMI in the frequency domain. We obtained initial measurements in a clean laboratory setting, and then collected further measurements in unrestricted home environments with diverse collections of other noisy electronics attached to the same powerline.

We found that all but the Sharp 32" TVs produce a significant amount of stable, robust information leakage over the powerline via EMI. As an example, for the Panasonic 42" TVs in a laboratory setting, we found that we can correctly match a random 15-minute EMI trace from a movie to a database of EMI signatures totaling 1200 movie minutes 96% of the time (the remaining 4% were below our matching threshold, not incorrectly matched); the hit rate drops to 92% in noisy home environments. More broadly, we sought to develop an infrastructure capable of exploring answers to the following five questions:

- Do TVs of different makes, models, and technologies produce repeatable EMI, when given repeated screen content?
- Does different screen content produce differentiable EMI from a given TV?
- Is EMI consistent across multiple instances of TVs from the same model family?
- Can we determine if someone is watching a particular video by matching an EMI sample to a database of EMI signatures?
- Can we match EMI recorded in a lab setting to EMI extracted in homes, especially when those homes might have a diverse array of other consumer electronics connected to the same powerline?

In general, we found that we are able to answer all these questions affirmatively, though with some caveats and clarifications, e.g., clarifications on what it means for an EMI trace to be "repeatable" or "consistent" and weaker results with the Sharp 32" TVs. Although explicitly not our primary goal, we also sought to conduct a preliminary investigation into the following question:

- Can we learn to predict what EMI a TV would produce given only screen content, i.e., without previous EMI traces for that TV model when displaying the content in question?

To summarize, our primary contribution is an extensive study of powerline EMI information leakage from a diverse collection of modern TVs, as well as the discovery that significant, stable, and robust information is, in fact, leaked from these devices. Fortunately, from a privacy perspective, we also observe that today’s utility companies are not collecting the granularity of information necessary for repeating our analyses, and the ubicomp technologies from the research community that could collect this type of information are not yet widely deployed. Nevertheless, these technologies are surprisingly near-term, e.g., smart meters exist today that report samples at 1 Hz but collect measurements at 3 kHz [7] (our approach in contrast samples at 500 kHz and uses measurements at 2 Hz) and we anticipate higher sampling rates in the near future.

Although these emerging technologies enable important applications, we stress here that the policies enacted today could help inform future utility and ubicomp deployments, and hence we argue that it is important to understand these findings today, before new technologies in or attached to the home begin to collect and store fine-grained powerline measurements at a large scale.

## 2. Technical Foundations
Modern consumer electronics utilize switched mode power supplies (SMPS), which are increasingly employed due to their higher efficiency and smaller form factor. Energy Star even mandates the use of this kind of power supply for most consumer electronic devices. We anticipate that the prevalence of SMPS will only increase as hardware manufacturers face continued pressure from political and market forces demanding higher levels of efficiency and miniaturization. The materials described here are either known or easily inferred from past work and an understanding of how electrical devices operate, e.g., [10].

### SMPS as EMI Sources
Despite the advantages SMPS provide, one side effect of SMPS operation is that they inadvertently produce electromagnetic interference (EMI). The EMI is a consequence of the voltage conversion method that SMPS employ, and its characteristics are proportional to the rate at which the conversion in the power supply takes place. This rate, also known as the switching frequency, is dynamically adjusted to meet the power requirements of the appliance driven by the SMPS. In sum, the changing power demands of an electronic device cause dynamic adjustments to the SMPS’s switching frequency, which in turn modulates the EMI signal.

- The EMI signature of each device is centered around the switching frequency of its power supply; different devices often occupy distinct frequency ranges, allowing for their noise signals to coexist with minimal interference. However, signal overlap is possible and increasingly likely if many active devices share the same powerline.
- Changes in EMI can manifest in frequency shifts, energy density changes, or both. These properties are visible in Figure 1, where the TV exhibits frequency shift EMI, while the washer signal produces density changes.

**Figure 1:** Frequency spectrogram showing various electrical appliances in the home. Washer cycle on (1) and off (2). CFL lamp turning off briefly (3) and then on (4). Note that the TV’s (Sharp 42” LCD) EMI shifts in frequency, which happens as screen content changes.

Note that EMI signals vary as a function of the operation of the device, e.g., washer EMI increases in energy density when the barrel is rotated during the spin cycle, and TV EMI is modulated in frequency as the screen content changes. We explore this phenomenon more deeply in our investigations below.

### Noise Propagation
The EMI generated by SMPS devices is coupled onto the powerline and propagates throughout the electric infrastructure (i.e., a home) while retaining its signal qualities. In our tests, we were able to capture robust signals several hundred feet away from the EMI source. We leverage this property and demonstrate that a single sensor anywhere along a home’s powerline (including outdoor outlets) can observe the conducted EMI signals from numerous connected SMPS-based devices.

### Signal Characteristics
The raw signals we gather with our powerline interface (PLI) (detailed in Section 5) are not particularly meaningful unless analyzed in the frequency domain. To transform the signal from a sequence of data points in time to a set of energies at various frequencies, we digitize the analog readings and compute a Fast Fourier Transform (described in detail later in the paper). The goal of these engineering operations is to allow us to analyze EMI fluctuations as changes in power over frequency space (visualized in Figure 1).

**Figure 1** presents a waterfall plot of the EMI observed in a typical home; note the rich information landscape which provides a detailed view of the EMI signatures of various devices.
