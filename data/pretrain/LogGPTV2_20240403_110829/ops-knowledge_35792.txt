Question: "In a side-channel timing attack on an RSA implementation, such as the one described against an Apache HTTPS web server using OpenSSL, what factors could contribute to the success of the attack in extracting the private key?"
 "A": "The malicious process would need to have administrative privileges on the victim server to perform cache analysis attacks."
 "B": "The adversary's ability to measure precise timing variations in the server's response to predict bits of the secret exponent is critical."
 "C": "The attacker must be physically present at the server's location to accurately measure response times."
 "D": "The adversary must be network-proximate to the victim server to effectively average over more queries and reduce noise."
Answer: BD
