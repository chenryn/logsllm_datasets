### Appendix: Defenses

#### A.1 Proof for Section 7
In this section, we describe a theoretical model in which subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against. The model is closely related to two existing theoretical models:

1. **Corrupted Clusterable Dataset Model**: This model was used to analyze the robustness to label noise of neural networks trained with early stopping [Reference 40].
2. **Subpopulation Mixture Model**: This model was used to justify the importance of memorization in learning and explain the gap between differentially private learning and non-private learning [Reference 20, STOC 2020].

Our model generalizes the first model and simplifies the second one. The key components of our model are:
- **Datasets**: Consisting of potentially noisy subpopulations of data.
- **Classifiers**: Assigning a uniform class to each cluster.

**Definition A.1 (Noisy 𝑘-Subpopulation Mixture Distribution)**: A noisy 𝑘-subpopulation mixture distribution \( D \) over \( X \times Y \) consists of \( k \) subpopulations \(\{D_i\}_{i=1}^k\) with distinct, known supports over \( X \), unknown mixture weights, and labels drawn from subpopulation-specific Bernoulli distributions.

- **Supports**: \(\{X_i \subset X\}_{i=1}^k\). By distinct supports, we mean that \(\forall i, j \in [k], i \neq j, \text{Supp}_X(D_i) \cap \text{Supp}_X(D_j) = \emptyset\).
- **Function**: There exists a function \( C_D : X \to [k] \) returning the subpopulation of the given sample.
- **Mixture Weights**: \(\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^k\); note that \(\sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i = 1\).
- **Full Distribution**: \( D = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i D_i \).

**Definition A.2 (𝑘-Subpopulation Mixture Learner)**: A subpopulation mixture learner \( A \) takes as input a dataset \( D \) of size \( n \) and the subpopulation function \( C_D \) of a noisy \( k \)-subpopulation mixture distribution \( D \), and returns a classifier \( f : [k] \to \{0, 1\} \). On a fresh sample \( x \), the classifier returns \( f(C_D(x)) \). The learner is locally dependent if \( f(i) \) depends only on \(\{y | (x, y) \in D \cap \text{Supp}_X(D_i)\}\).

The learners considered in both [40] (particular shallow wide neural networks) and [20] (\( k \)-nearest neighbors, mixture models, overparameterized linear models) are locally dependent.

**Theorem A.3**: For any dataset \( D \) of size \( n \) drawn from a noisy \( k \)-subpopulation mixture distribution and subpopulation function \( C_D \), there exists a subpopulation poisoning attack \( D_p \) of size \( \leq n/k \) that causes all locally dependent \( k \)-subpopulation mixture learners \( A \) that minimize 0-1 loss in binary classification to return:
\[ A(D \cup D_p) = A(D) \]
with probability \( \frac{1}{2} \).

**Proof**:
- Assume without loss of generality that \( K = \arg \min_i |D \cap \text{Supp}_X(D_i)| \), and write \( D_K = D \cap \text{Supp}_X(D_i) \).
- Our attack operates by taking \( D_K \) and flipping all of its labels, producing \( D_p^K \).
- Suppose we provide the learner with the original dataset \( D \) and the returned classifier is \( f \). On the other hand, when we provide the learner with the poisoned dataset \( D' = D \cup D_p^K \), it returns \( f' \).
- Datasets \( D \) and \( D' \) differ in \( |D_K| \) records, which is \( \leq n/k \) according to the pigeonhole principle (\( K \) being the smallest subpopulation).
- From the properties assumed about the learner \( A \), we have:
  \[ A(D') = A(D) \]
  with probability \( > \frac{1}{2} \), which implies that learners \( f \) and \( f' \) return the same label for subpopulation \( K \): \( f(K) = f'(K) \).
- However, because \( f \) and \( f' \) are locally dependent and make their decisions based on subpopulations to minimize the 0-1 loss, adding enough points in \( D' \) to flip the decision results in:
  \[ f'(K) = 1 - f(K) \]
- These two statements result in a contradiction, proving the first part of the theorem.

**Improving Bounds on the Smallest Subpopulation**:
- For a sample from a noisy \( k \)-subpopulation mixture distribution, consider the smallest subpopulation \( j = \arg \min_i \alpha_i \) and its mixture coefficient \( \alpha = \alpha_j \).
- Use the multiplicative Chernoff bound with \( \delta > 0 \):
  \[
  \Pr[|D \cap \text{Supp}_X(D_j)| > 2\alpha n] \leq \exp\left(-\frac{\alpha n \delta^2}{2 + \delta}\right)
  \]
- Setting \( \mu = \alpha_j n = \alpha n \) and \( \delta = 1 \) in the above Chernoff bound gives:
  \[
  \Pr[X > (1 + \delta)\mu] \leq 1 - \exp(-5) = 99.3\%
  \]
- The pigeonhole principle requires a poisoning attack of size \( 200 \).

#### A.2 Experimental Defenses Addendum
The version of TRIM/ILTM used in our experiments can be found in Algorithm 4.

**Figure 2** illustrates a potential failure mode for availability attack defenses, related to the theoretical impossibility result but using logistic regression, a model not captured by our theoretical results. The figure portrays three logistic regression models:
- **Unpoisoned Model**
- **Poisoned Model**
- **Poisoned Model with TRIM Applied**

Trained on a synthetic binary classification dataset consisting of three subpopulations, each subpopulation has 20 data points, and 30 points are used to poison the second subpopulation. The difference between Figures 2a and 2b indicates that the subpopulation attack is fairly successful.
