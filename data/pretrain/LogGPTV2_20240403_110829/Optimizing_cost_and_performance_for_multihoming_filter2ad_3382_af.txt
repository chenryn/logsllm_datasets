to one ISP to two ISPs, and an additional 10% reduction when the
user subscribes to four ISPs. Similar results are observed when we
use other trafﬁc traces or vary the user’s ﬁrst-hop nodes.
7.3.2
Interactions Among Multiple Smart Routing
Users
Next we examine how trafﬁc from different smart routing users
interacts. In our experiment, we start with a single smart routing
user (called user 1) subscribing to two ISPs. We incrementally add
new smart routing users (each subscribing to two ISPs) to the net-
work to examine the interactions of smart routing trafﬁc. We scale
up the trafﬁc by a factor of 3 to examine how smart routing per-
forms in a highly utilized network. In the interest of clarity, we plot
only the performance of user 1 in Figure 19 (a). The results for
other users are consistent. As we can see, the performance degra-
dation of user 1 remains less than 2 ms as the number of competing
smart routing users increases. These results suggest that smart rout-
ing users can co-exist well.
Next, we repeat the above experiment, where each smart routing
user subscribes to all four ISPs. Again, in the interest of clarity, we
plot only the performance of user 1 in Figure 19 (b). We observe
that an increase in the number of competing smart routing users
has little effect on the performance of user 1. Moreover, user 1 im-
proves its performance by about 8% when the number of its ISPs
increases from two to four. The other users see a similar level of im-
provement (5–10%) when subscribing to two additional ISPs. This
result is consistent with our ﬁndings in the previous subsection.
7.3.3
Interactions between Smart Routing Users and
Single-homed Users
Finally, we study the interactions between smart routing users
and single-homed users through the following two experiments.
In our ﬁrst experiment, we start with two single-homed users.
We examine the effects of adding one more ISP subscription to
user 1. Figure 20 summarizes the results. As shown in Figure 20
(a), the performance of user 1 improves with the additional ISP,
while the performance of user 2 remains almost the same after user
1 subscribes to one more ISP. This result indicates that a multi-

homed user can improve its performance without adversely affect-
ing a single-homed user. Note that the average latency of user 2 is
lower than that of user 1 (with and without smart routing ) in some
intervals, although user 1 outperforms user 2 most of the time.
Next, we add one more ISP to user 2 as well. Figure 20 (b) shows
that the latency of user 2 decreases without affecting user 1.
In
addition, we observe that smart routing users can take advantage of
additional connections to smooth out trafﬁc and reduce maximum
link utilization by up to 10%.
In our second experiment, we have 5 users, which include one
user that switches from single-homed to multihomed (referred to as
user 1), two smart routing users, and two single-homed users. We
compare the performance of all users before and after user 1 be-
comes multihomed. Our results show that user 1 improves its per-
formance by 18%, whereas the latency of the other users changes
within 1%.
Summary: Our evaluation results based on realistic settings show
that the effect of self-interference is very small under trafﬁc equilib-
ria. In addition, we show that smart routing improves performance
by 10–20%. Moreover, smart routing users co-exist well with other
smart routing users and single-homed users.
8. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we design a series of novel smart routing algo-
rithms to optimize cost and performance for multihomed users.
Using both analysis and extensive simulations based on realistic
traces, we show that our algorithms are very effective in minimizing
cost and improving performance. We further examine the global ef-
fects of smart routing using simulations based on realistic topolo-
gies and trafﬁc. Our results show that under trafﬁc equilibria smart
routing can improve performance without hurting other trafﬁc.
There are several avenues for future work. In this paper, we fo-
cus on algorithmic design and evaluation through analysis and sim-
ulation. A natural next step is to implement the algorithms and
conduct experiments in the Internet.
In addition, we only study

is also interesting to investigate the dynamics of such interactions.
Finally, increasingly wide deployment of smart routing poses new
challenges to ISPs by intensifying the competition among different
ISPs and making trafﬁc less predictable. How ISPs should address
these challenges is an open issue.

B. PROOF OF THEOREM 5
PROOF. The proof is by reduction from the NP-complete set-
partition problem [10]. Speciﬁcally, the set-partition problem is to
determine whether the numbers in a given set S (with non-negative
integer values) can be partitioned into two subsets A and S − A
such that the sum of the elements in A is equal to half of the total
sum of all elements in S.
2
(cid:80)
(cid:80)
Given an instance of the set-partition problem (a set S), we con-
struct an instance of the integral assignment problem as follows.
First, the assignment problem has two ISPs, each with a cost func-
tion c(x) equal to 0 when x ≤ 1
y∈S y, and 1 when x >
1
y∈S y. We assume that both ISPs use 100th-percentile charg-
2
ing. Second, we map each element in S to a ﬂow in the assignment
problem, with the size of each ﬂow (at all intervals) being the value
of the corresponding element. Then if we have any polynomial-
time constant-approximation-ratio algorithm to the assignment prob-
lem, we can decide the original set-partition problem in polynomial-
time by checking whether the cost returned by the approximation
algorithm is equal to 0 or not.
C. MINIMIZING COST OF TOTAL
VOLUME BASED CHARGING
The problem of minimizing cost when ISPs use total-volume
based charging can be cast into the following linear program, where
ck denotes the cost function of ISP k, tk is the total trafﬁc assigned
to ISP k during its charging period, and TotalTraﬃc is the total
volume of trafﬁc during the charging period. This problem can be
readily solved using LP software such as lp solve [14].
