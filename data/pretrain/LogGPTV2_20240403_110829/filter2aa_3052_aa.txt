You’re Just Complaining 
Because You’re Guilty:

Software Used in the Criminal Justice System

Motivation/overview of the problem
Black box decision making
●
Software is increasingly used to make important decisions about people’s 
lives
○
Hiring, housing, how we make friends, find partners, navigate city streets, get our news, …
○
The weightier the decision the more crucial it is that we understand and can question it
○
What input is used to make the decision? Is it correct? Do we have other information that 
should be considered? 
○
Are protected attributes like race and gender used? What about proxies for those 
characteristics?
●
Criminal justice system
○
Software/algorithmic decision making used increasingly throughout the criminal justice system
○
Often black boxes for which trade secret protection is claimed to be more important than rights 
of individual defendants or citizens to understand the decisions
○
Evidence of problems 
○
How can we find bugs and fix problems if the answer is always “you can’t question” and “you 
are just complaining because you are guilty”?
Can you imagine...
●
Being sent to prison rather than given probation because proprietary software 
says you are likely to commit another crime? 
○
But you can’t ask how the software makes its decisions. (Eric Loomis)
●
Having the primary evidence against you being the results of DNA software? 
○
But one program says you did it and another says you didn’t.  (Nick Hillary)
●
Being accused of murder solely because of DNA transferred by paramedics?  
○
But they don’t figure that out for months. (Lukis Anderson)
●
Software and complex systems need an 
iterative process of debugging and 
improvement!
●
Anyone who has used technology knows 
that there are glitches and bugs and 
unintended consequences!
●
Anyone who builds technology knows how 
easy it is for there to be substantial bugs 
you did not find!
●
Huge advantages to independent, third-
party testing aimed at finding bugs!
●
If only those with interests in the success of 
software see the details, we have a huge 
problem and a recipe for injustice!

Mimics a cell phone tower and emits a 
signal that compels cell phones in the area 
to connect to it rather than a legitimate 
tower
●
Not all cell-site simulators are “Stingrays”

“He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. 
They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your 
head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness they 
had never mastered the secret of finding out what another 
human being was thinking.”

“FST went online for casework in April 
2011, following its approval for use by 
the Commission. Shortly thereafter, also 
in April 2011, some functions were 
updated by the programmers and a 
small, unrelated change was 
inadvertently made, causing OCME to 
take FST off-line.”
