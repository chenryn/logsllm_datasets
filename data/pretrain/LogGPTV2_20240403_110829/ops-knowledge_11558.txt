User: Going back to my previous question on OCSP, does anybody know of "reliable" OCSP libraries  for Python, Java and C?
I need "client" OCSP functionality, as I'll be checking the status of Certs against an OCSP responder, so responder functionality is not that important.
Thanks
Assistant: Have you check pyOpenSSL.. am sure openssl supports ocsp and python binding may support it
