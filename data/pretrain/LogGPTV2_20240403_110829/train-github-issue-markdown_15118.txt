After using VS Code for a while, it gets slower and slower. I notice it
particularly when it attempts to auto-complete.
It will then sometimes crash. It may crash whilst I'm using it. It may crash
when I haven't used it for sometime but using another window. It may crash if
I leave the PC overnight. It may crash if I only used it for a very short
amount of time and the slowdown above hadn't occurred.
Looking at the Windows Task Manager does not show it using any more memory at
this time (it peaks at around 38MB and never goes above 1% CPU although is
usually at 0%). The PC has plenty of resources/memory free.
Unfortunately I can't find a pattern. It is worse now though than it was when
it first started occurring several releases ago.
I just get a dialog "Visual Studio has crashed. We are sorry for the
inconvenience! Please restart Visual Studio Code." and no other indication as
to the cause.
Code v0.10.6, issue has occurred since around v0.3  
Windows 8.1, i7-4770 with 16GB RAM. SSD disk.  
Git repository contains over 39,000 files across folders at various levels
deep. These are mostly HP BASIC .BAS (OpenVMS files which we maintain on
Windows) plus bespoke 4GL files.  
I don't use any of the git functionality within Code, I do commits etc
externally.  
I use Ctrl+E frequently to find/open files.  
Shift+Ctrl+B runs a windows .bat file to transfer and compile the code  
settings.json: "editor.insertSpaces": true, "files.trimTrailingWhitespace":
true
