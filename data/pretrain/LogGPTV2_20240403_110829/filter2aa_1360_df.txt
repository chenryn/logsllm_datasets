Once you have completed your research, you will need to compile your intelligence into a professional report. 
Using the correct tools and techniques for documentation throughout your investigation will make generating 
your final report a relatively painless process.

Standard Notes is the best privacy focused note-taking application with AES-256 encryption and has a very clear 
privacy policy. It has open-source versions for Mac, Windows, IOS, Android, Linux, and web browsers making 
it a great fit for OS1NT work. You can use Standard Notes completely offline, but if you choose to make an 
account even the free tier supports sync and end-to-end encryption. The premium version adds advanced 
features such as multi-factor authentication, automated backups to your own cloud service of choice, and some 
aesthetic options, such as themes. Figure 30.01 displays typical usage.
OneNote is the power option for digital note-taking at the price of a privacy compromise, but it is worth 
mentioning because many of us work for organizations that use Microsoft Office as their enterprise office 
platform. I recommend installing the standalone version of OneNote unless your agency requires use of the 
cloud-based Office 365 ecosystem. The default version is 32bit. If you want the 64bit build, look for "Other 
download options” at the bottom of the page listed above. Creating a fresh Microsoft account will prevent the 
installation from cross contaminating your other MS Office projects. Microsoft will offer to provide you with a 
new Oudook.com address, but a ProtonMail address would be the better choice for most people.
Like any form of research, note-taking is essential when conducting a professional OSINT investigation. As 
mentioned in the previous chapter, I prefer to take my notes in both paper and digital formats. The paper 
scratchpad is for quick identifiers, reminders, and at times a rough diagram. The digital notes are for pasting 
copied text, images, video, or other files. My hand-written notes tend to be unstructured, whereas collecting 
digital content often benefits from a pre-structured destination. The following are my recommendations for 
solid digital notebook applications for OSINT work, along with some of their respective pros and cons.
CherryTree (giuspen.com/chertytree)

• 
Open a terminal window by clicking on the shortcut in your Dock.
• 
Type the following into terminal: sudo apt-get install cherrytree
• 
Press enter and you will see CherryTree and all dependencies installed.
You can create your own templates with the export feature. Once you have a notebook structure complete, click 
"Export" and then "Export To CherryTree Document". In the next window, choose "All the Tree" and click 
"OK". For storage type, leave the top option selected and click "OK". Type in a name for your template, such 
as "OSINT_TemplateSeptl9" and click "Save". If launching a new investigation on a clean VM, the following 
steps will add your template within the application.
CherryTree is my note-taking application of choice for Linux. It ticks all the boxes we like such as being open- 
source and offline. What separates it from other Linux options is its ability to support both hierarchical notes 
and some limited support for storing images, tables, and other filetypes. The following steps will install 
CherryTree to your Linux Original VM.
The desktop version of OneNote is supported on Mac, IOS, Android, and most major browsers, but each will 
require authentication with the account you used for installation. Microsoft, like other major platforms, forces 
you to sync to their ecosystem whenever possible. I have had litde luck getting even the "offline" versions of 
their Office products to load without an internet connection. What makes OneNote unique is its ability to 
organize notes in a hierarchical structure, similar to pages within sections within notebooks. From an 
organizational perspective, it functions exactly like an old-school case binder of paper reports and printouts. I 
can create a new notebook tided "CopperThieves" with tabbed sections for each suspect. Each section is then 
broken down into my desired pages: Bio, Facebook, Twitter, Vehicles, Employment, etc. These pages can be 
populated from scratch, or 1 can preload them with my case templates or a simple spreadsheet.
Open CherryTree from the Applications menu and add to your favorites, if desired. CherryTree has vast 
functionality, but the core feature of which we want to take advantage is the hierarchical node structure. Think 
of Nodes as notebook sections and SubNodes as pages within those sections. On the left side of the CherryTree 
window is the "node tree", which shows everything in your current notebook. To add a new section, click on 
"Tree" in the top toolbar and then "Add Node". Give your node a logical name such as "Facebook" and select 
"OK". To add a page or "SubNode" to that section, right-click on the node and select "Add SubNode". Name 
it appropriately and click "OK". Most of the functions we care about can be completed via the "Tree" menu in 
the toolbar or by using the right-click context menu.
Another feature that makes OneNote beneficial for data collection is its ability to accept just about any filetype 
as insertions or pastes into the pages. I can drag a pdf report from the Department of Licensing and drop it on 
the "Vehicles" page of a target and OneNote will ask if I want it added as a printout or file. The printout option 
adds a human readable image of the file, while the file option embeds the pdf file itself. I like to add both image 
and file by dragging in the pdf twice. That gives me a visual representation of the pdf contents while also saving 
a copy of the report in its native format. Double clicking on that pdf file after import would open it in a browser 
window or pdf reader of choice.
1 keep an original section prepopulated with my templates. For each new case, I right-click the section tab at the 
top of the window and select "Move or Copy". I select the destination notebook and click "Copy". If I select 
the same notebook where my original is, it will paste the copy into a new tab, but add a number to the section 
name, such as "Template 1". Now 1 can double-click that tab and rename it appropriately. 1 can also export 
entire notebooks by clicking on "File" and then "Export". Notebooks can be exported in a proprietary format, 
whereas sections and pages may also be exported as pdfs, docs, and several other file formats. This is convenient 
should you want to export sections from your digital notes to include in your report appendix.

CherryTree is not without its downsides. It is not nearly as user-friendly as OneNote when it comes to drag-n- 
drop and its support for inserting non-text filetypes is inconsistent. However, it is a hierarchical digital notebook 
within our Linux VM and one with much greater privacy than we could ever obtain using a Microsoft or other 
closed-source office application. There is a windows installer available as well, although I recommend using the 
Linux version in your VM whenever possible. A CherryTree template is included in the digital files download 
page.
You may want to consider adding Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) to your arsenal of 
documentation tools. These are applications built for programmers and web developers for writing and testing 
their code. While full IDEs can be very complex, there are a handful of “light” IDEs or advanced text-editors 
which fit well into our workflow. The editors handle basic note-taking quite well. They also provide additional 
capabilities such as built-in terminals and mark-down support, which is exacdy what we need when customizing 
our OSINT tools as previously explained. There are significant efficiency gains to be had when using a tool that 
suppons note-taking, running scripts, and editing code all within a single interface. While many readers will 
continue to rely on office suites from major publishers to prepare your final reports, these light IDEs are capable 
of handling much of our investigative workflow.
• 
Download or copy your template file to the desktop of your VM. The template file will have a file 
extension of .ctb.
• 
Within CherryTree, click "File" and "Open File".
• 
Browse to your desktop, select your template, and click "Open".
• 
Click "File" then "Save As".
• 
Leave the storage type as "SQLite, Not Protected (.ctb)" and click "OK".
• 
Type in your case name/number as the new filename and click on "Save".
Although not a full IDE, Atom offers a simple and attractive interface and large collection of plugins which can 
be used to add additional functionality. It requires very litde configuration and yet is highly customizable if you 
choose to do so. While the base application lacks a terminal, that functionality can be added by way of 
community plugins. Atom is less responsive than some of the other editors when working with larger files. It is 
open-source and easy to install on macOS, Windows, or Linux using the package managers previously explained.
The advanced text editors explained here were chosen based on the balance of functionality; ease of use; and 
their status as open-source applications. Each is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux which makes them 
ubiquitous across all major platforms. VSCode is very powerful with a large variety of extensions which add 
near limitless functionality, but at the cost of being tied into a proprietary Microsoft product. VSCodium strips 
away the Microsoft piece, but at the cost of some functionality. Atom and Joplin are very user friendly, but lack 
many of the extra features that define a true interactive development environment. I recommend testing each 
and using the editors which feel right to you and make your workflow smooth. For those not ready to move to 
a more advanced editor, consider the previous recommendations for basic text editors and mainstream office 
applications.
My primary needs from an advanced editor are text notes, mark-down editing, and access to run terminal 
commands. The following plugins will add HTML and terminal support to the editor.
