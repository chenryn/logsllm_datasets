Subject: Issue with Map Functionality and Site Performance in Basic JavaScript

Dear Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am encountering an issue with the map functionality in Basic JavaScript. Whenever I click on the map, I receive the following error message: "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later."

Additionally, I have noticed that the site has been running significantly slower than usual for over a week.

Could you please look into these issues and provide any necessary assistance to resolve them?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
Dave
