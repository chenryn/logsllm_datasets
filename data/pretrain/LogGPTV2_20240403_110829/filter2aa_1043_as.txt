### Conclusion

- There can be substantial differences in interference performance among different VSB receivers and interference mechanisms, regardless of age and vintage.
- Interfering signals on the upper and lower first adjacent channel are the most problematic and consistently result in large calculated interference distances “r”.
- In general, interfering signals on the second and third adjacent channels (+7, +14, and +15) can also result in significant interference distances under certain circumstances for certain receivers.
- Multiple interfering signals reduce the D/U ratios. The worst case appears to be N+x and N+2x. Degradation of more than 30 dB has been measured on some receivers.

### Appendix 2: Calculation of Distance “r”

#### Section 1: Relation between the Radiated Power from an Isotropic Point Source in Free Space and the Power at the Output of a Receiving Antenna

The relation between the incident electric field and the power at the output of the receiving antenna is given by:

\[ Ei (dBV/m) = VL (dBV) + 20 \log F (MHz) - Gant (dBi) - 10 \log RL (\Omega) - 10 \log p - 10 \log q - 12.8 \]

Where:
- \( Gant \) is the isotropic gain (dBi) of the receiving antenna.
- \( p \) is the polarization match factor.
- \( q \) is the impedance match factor.

#### Section 2: Relation between the Power Radiated from an Isotropic Point Source in Free Space and the Resultant Electric Field at a Distance “r”

For a point source in free space, the power density \( W \) (Watt/sq. meter) is given by:

\[ W = \frac{Prad}{4 \pi r^2} = \frac{E^2}{120} \]

This leads to:

\[ E (dBV/m) = Prad (dBm) - 20 \log r (meter) + 104.77 \]

#### Section 3: Relation between the Power Radiated from an Isotropic Point Source in Free Space and the Resultant Power at the Output of a Receiving Antenna

The voltage across the load connected to the receiving antenna can be related to the power radiated from the point source through:

\[ VL (dBV) = Prad (dBm) - 20 \log r (meter) - 20 \log F (MHz) + Gant (dBi) + 10 \log RL (\Omega) + 10 \log q + 10 \log p + 117.57 \]

The power delivered to the load can be related to the power radiated from the point source through:

\[ PL (dBm) = Prad (dBm) - 20 \log r (meter) - 20 \log F (MHz) + Gant (dBi) + 10 \log q + 10 \log p + 27.57 \]

#### Section 4: Calculating the Distance from a Point Radiator at which the Desired TV Channel is at TOV

The distance “r” from a point radiator at which the desired TV channel is at TOV can be calculated using:

\[ 20 \log r (meter) = Prad (dBm) - PL (dBm) - 20 \log F (MHz) + Gant (dBi) + 10 \log p + 10 \log q + 27.57 \]

Assuming a point radiator with 100-mW output power and 6-dBi transmitting antenna gain, the maximum radiated power would be 400-mW (26 dBm). For these calculations, \( Prad \) is taken to be 26 dBm and the DTV receiving antenna gain is taken to be zero (Gant = 0 dBi).

Further assuming that the receiving antenna is matched with the load and has the same polarization as the incident wave, then \( 10 \log p = 10 \log q = 0 \):

\[ 20 \log r (meter) = 53.57 - PL (dBm) - 20 \log F (MHz) \]

If the desired channel is fixed and the undesired channel is taken from N–15 to N+15, then “20 log F” should be calculated and inserted in the equation for each undesired channel. If the undesired channel is fixed and the desired channel is taken from N–15 to N+15, then “20 log F” is fixed and equal to “20 log (centre freq. of undesired channel).”

It should be noted that channels N-15 or N+15 in the tables mean that the undesired channel is taken to be 15 channels less or more than the desired channel, respectively.

### 1. Introduction

On May 25, 2004, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) that proposes to allow unlicensed radio transmitters to operate in the broadcast television spectrum at locations where that spectrum is not being used. CRC was contracted by MSTV to conduct measurements to investigate the possible impact of interference from the unlicensed devices on the current DTV and NTSC services.

Based on the FCC NPRM, the proposed Unlicensed Devices (UD) “radiated emissions that fall outside the TV broadcast channel(s) where the device operates must comply with the radiated emission limits specified in §15.209(a).” Section 15.209(a) of the FCC rules state that “the radiated emission limits over frequency band of 215-960 MHz is 200 µV/m at a measurement distance of 3 meters.” The emission limit is based on measurement employing a CISPR quasi-peak detector with a measurement bandwidth of 120 kHz.

Based on the Commission proposal, CRC conducted measurements to characterize the de-sensitization of ATSC DTV and NTSC receivers from the side-lobe radiated emissions of an unlicensed portable device. Specifically, the following laboratory evaluations were performed:
- De-sensitization of DTV receivers in an indoor environment.
- De-sensitization of NTSC receivers in an indoor environment.

### 2. Laboratory Test Set-up

The Unlicensed Devices interference emissions signals were generated using a random noise generator provided by CRC. The UD emission signals were generated by CRC in such a way as to meet the FCC emissions requirement (i.e., 200 µV/m, or 46 dBµV/m within a 120 kHz bandwidth). The interfering emissions signals were measured at 3 m from the unlicensed devices, within a 120 kHz bandwidth. The UD interfering emitted signal power level was adjusted to 3 dB below the FCC emission requirement to avoid any impact of measurement error on the measurement results. The generated unlicensed devices interference emission signals were filtered and inserted on the desired DTV or NTSC channel. Below is a summary of the relevant parameters and calculations used to conduct these tests:

**FCC Emission Limit:**
- 200 µV/m, or 46 dBµV/m within 120 kHz
- Convert to dBm: 
  \[ P_{dBm} = 46 - 20 \log (539) + 29.5 = -75.5 \, \text{dBm} \]

**Interference Signal Parameters:**
- Random Noise filtered with a bandpass filter
- 3-dB bandwidth: 30 MHz

To avoid measurement error, the interference level is set at 3 dB below the FCC specified limit:
- For channels 24 to 26, the interference level is: 
  \[ P_{dBm} = -87.1 \, \text{dBm within 120 kHz} \]
- For channels 52 to 54, the interference level is: 
  \[ P_{dBm} = -89.5 \, \text{dBm within 120 kHz} \]

**Test Setup:**
- Video Monitors
- ATSC Receivers
- Vector Signal Analyzer (HP 89440A)
- NTSC Televisions
- Undesired Signal Generator
