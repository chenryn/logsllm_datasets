the receiving antenna 
Relation between the incident electric field intensity Ei (rms) and the voltage VL (rms) 
across the load RL, to which the antenna is connected, can be written as [1]:    
Ei (dBV/m) = VL (dBV) + 20 log F (MHz) – Gant (dBi) 
– 10 log RL () – 10 log p – 10 log q – 12.8 
In this relation “Gant” is the isotropic gain (dBi) of the receiving antenna. It should be 
noted, however, that if the receiving antenna is directional (with maximum gain of “Gant 
(dBi)”), but it is not directed toward the transmitter, then the decrease in gain due to this
“off-direction” should be subtracted from Gant before inserting it in the equation. 
“p” is polarization match factor and is 1 (or 10 log p = 0 dB) when the incident wave an
the antenna both have the same polarization.  
“q” is the impedance match factor and is equal to 1 if the antenna is matched with the 
transmission line or the load to which it is connected. In case of mismatch, its value can 
be found in terms of antenna and load impedance, or the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio 
(VSWR) of the antenna [2].  
It is also common to relate Ei and VL in terms of Antenna Factor (AF). To do this, 
equation (1.1) can be rewritten as: 
Ei (dBV/m) = VL (dBV) + AF 
AF = 20 log F (MHz) – Gant (dBi) – 10 log R  () – 10 log p – 10 log q – 12.8

 Wiley and sons, ISBN 0-471-02590-9 
[2] In case of mismatch between the receiving antenna and the load to which it is connected, “q” can be 
d as: 
foun
q  =  4 RARL    [ (RA + RL)² + (XA + XL)² ] 
Where “R” is the real and “X” is the imaginary part of the impedance and suffixes A and L are for Antenna 
and Load. Perfect match is when RA = RL and XA = – XL (conjugate match).  
 “q” can also be found from VSWR of the antenna as:  
q  =  1 –  [ (VSWR – 1)    (VSWR + 1) ] ²

Section 2: Relation between the power radiated from an isotropic point source in 
free space and the resultant electric field at a distance “r” 
For a point source (isotropic radiator) in free space, power density W (Watt/sq. meter) is 
[3]: 
W = Prad  4  r² = E²  120  
have not been taken into account. From equation 2.1 we can get: 
E² = 30 Prad  r² 
This equation in turn leads to:  
E (dBV/m) = Prad (dBm) – 20 log r (meter) + 104.77 
Section 3
Where Prad is the total radiated power (Watts) from the point source, E is the free space 
electric field (V/m), and r is the radial distance from the radiator (meter).  
It should be noted, however, that Prad in this equation represents the radiated power at 
the output of the transmitting antenna (which here is assumed to be an isotropic point 
radiator) and so, factors such as efficiency, mismatch, etc. of the transmitting antenna
: Relation between the power radiated from an isotropic point source in 
free space and the resultant power at the output of a receiving antenna 
Replacing “Ei” in equation 1.1 with “E” obtained from equation 2.2, we can relate the 
voltage across the load (to which the receiving antenna is connected) with the power 
radiated from the point source through the following equation:  
VL (dBV) = Prad (dBm) – 20 log r (meter) – 20 log F (MHz) + Gant (dBi) 
+ 10 log RL () + 10 log q + 10 log p + 117.57 
The output voltage of the antenna (VL) can also be converted to the power (PL) delivered 
to the load (RL). Using P = V²  R, we can get:  
VL (dBV) = PL (dBm) + 10 log RL () + 90 
Replacing VL in equation 3.1 with the one obtained from equation 3.2, we can relate the 
power (PL) delivered by a receiving antenna to the load (to which it is connected), and 
the power radiated from the point source (Prad) through the following equation: 
PL (dBm) = Prad (dBm) – 20 log r (meter) –20 log F (MHz)  
+ Gant (dBi) + 10 log q + 10 log p + 27.57

Section 4: Calculating the distance from a point radiator at which the desired TV 
channel is at TOV 
Equation 3.3 (rewritten as equation 4.1 below) is used for calculating the distance “r” 
from a point radiator at which the desired TV channel is at TOV.  
20 log r (meter) = Prad (dBm) – PL (dBm) – 20 log F (MHz) 
+ Gant (dBi) + 10 log p + 10 log q + 27.57 
In this equation, PL is the power delivered to the load connected to the receiving antenna. 
If we replace it with the power of the undesired DTV channel that causes TOV for the 
desired channel (obtained from the tests), then the value of “r” obtained from the above 
equation represents the distance at which the radiator causes TOV for the desired DTV 
channel. At distances closer to the radiator, interference to the desired DTV channel 
would be more and reception failure could be expected. It should be noted, however, that 
this way of finding “r” is valid only if one radiator is operating in the vicinity of the TV 
receiver in the whole 6 MHz bandwidth of the corresponding adjacent TV channel. For 
more than one radiator, their cumulative effect should be taken into account. 
It should be noted, however, that the cumulative interference of more than one radiator 
into the desired DTV channel can sometimes be much worse than that anticipated by 
simple mathematical power adding rules. This is because the aggregate interference 
actually depends on some non-linear mechanisms. One such mechanism is that due to 
receiver’s nonlinearity, multiple interferences can result in inter-modulation products. 
For example, two equal power and equal distance radiators are mathematically expected 
to create about 3-dB higher interference into the DTV receiver. But if the two radiators 
are operating on two adjacent channels separated by 6 or 7 DTV channels, then their 
inter-modulation products can interfere with the IF processing in the receiver. Depending 
on the specific receiver’s response, this can result in much more than 3-dB degradation. 
The test results of multiple-interference clearly demonstrate such phenomena.   
Assuming a point radiator with 100-mW output power and 6-dBi transmitting antenna 
gain, the maximum radiated power would be 400-mW (26 dBm). For these calculations, 
Prad is taken to be 26 dBm and to balance such assumption, the DTV receiving antenna 
gain is taken to be zero (Gant = 0 dBi).  
Further assuming that the receiving antenna is matched with the load (to which it is 
connected) and has the same polarization as the incident wave, then 10 log p = 10 log q = 
0 and we can rewrite (4.1) as:  
20 log r (meter) = 53.57 – PL (dBm) – 20 log F (MHz)

If the desired channel is fixed and undesired channel is taken from N–15 to N+15, then 
“20 log F” should be calculated and inserted in the equation for each undesired channel.  
If undesired channel is fixed and the desired channel is taken from N–15 to N+15, then 
“20 log F” in the above equations is fixed and equal to “20 log (centre freq. of undesired 
channel).  
It should be noted, however, that channels N-15 or N+15 in the tables mean that the 
undesired channel is taken to be 15 channels less or more than the desired channel 
respectively. So, in the case of fixed desired (on Ch-32), channels N-15 to N+15 are 
representing channels 17 to 47. But in the case of fixed undesired (on Ch-46), N-15 is 
actually channel 61 (as the desired channel is on Ch-61 and undesired channel on Ch-46), 
and N+15 is Ch-31 (as the desired channel is on Ch-31 and undesired channel is Ch-46).

Introduction 
On May 25, 2004, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) that proposes to 
allow unlicensed radio transmitters to operate in the broadcast television spectrum at locations 
where that spectrum is not being used.  CRC was contracted by MSTV to conduct measurements 
to investigate the possible impact of interference from the unlicensed devices on the current DTV 
and NTSC services. 
Based on the FCC NPRM, the proposed Unlicensed Devices (UD) “radiated emissions that fall 
outside the TV broadcast channel(s) where the device operates must comply with the radiated 
emission limits specified in §15.209(a)”.  Section 15.209(a) of the FCC rules state that “the 
radiated emission limits over frequency band of 215-960 MHz is 200 dBµV/m at a measurement 
distance of 3 meters”.  The emission limit is based on measurement employing a CISPR quasi-
peak detector with a measurement bandwidth of 120 kHz. 
Based on the Commission proposal, CRC conducted measurement to characterise the de-
sensitisation of ATSC DTV and NTSC receivers from the side-lobe radiated emissions of an 
unlicensed portable device.  Specifically the following laboratory evaluations were performed: 
-
De-sensitisation of DTV receivers in an indoor environment. 
-
De-sensitisation of NTSC receivers in an indoor environment.

Laboratory Test Set-up 
The Unlicensed Devices interference emissions signals were generated using a random noise 
generator provided by CRC. The UD emission signals were generated by CRC in such a way as 
to meet the FCC emissions requirement. (i.e. 200 µV/m, or 46 dBµV/m within a 120 kHz 
bandwidth).  The interfering emissions signals were measured at 3 m from the unlicensed 
devices, within a 120 kHz bandwidth. The UD interfering emitted signal power level was 
adjusted to 3 dB below the FCC emission requirement to avoid any impact of measurement error 
on the measurement results. The generated unlicensed devices interference emission signals were 
filtered and inserted on the desired DTV or NTSC channel. List below is a summary of the 
relevant parameters and calculations used to conduct these tests:
