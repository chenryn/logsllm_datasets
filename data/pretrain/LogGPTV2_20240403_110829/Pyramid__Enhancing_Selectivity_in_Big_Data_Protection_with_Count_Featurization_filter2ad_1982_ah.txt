problem. For ML workloads, we ﬁnd that a productive
93
way of identifying potential mechanisms is to model the
problem as a training set minimization problem. This
reveals a rich set of mechanisms that might be leveraged
to achieve data selectivity. We have identiﬁed several
promising mechanisms, which we hope to incorporate
into Pyramid for wider workload coverage:
• Vector quantization (VQ). VQ [12] is a family of tech-
niques used to compactly represent high dimensional,
real-valued feature vectors. At a high level, VQ computes
a small subset of vectors, known as the codebook or the
centroids, that are representative of the entire set of input
vectors (e.g., historical data).
• Sampling. Uniform random sampling and more ad-
vanced techniques like herding [68] can be used to
maintain a representative sample of the historical data.
This sample can be combined with in-use data to form a
training set. Compared to VQ, which often makes certain
assumptions about the underlying data (e.g., that it forms
clusters), sampling techniques are more general.
• Active learning. Active learning algorithms [15] tell
users what speciﬁc data points they need for improved
accuracy. Originally built to decrease manual labeling,
they may be valuable to selective data collection.
We leave investigation of such mechanisms for future
work. The key challenge will be to identify the kinds of
protection and privacy guarantees achievable with these
mechanisms, and how to effectively implement them.
This paper provides a ﬁrst blueprint for this process.
