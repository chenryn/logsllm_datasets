## SS7 Basics
SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) is a set of telephony protocols used to:
- Set up and tear down telephone calls
- Send and receive SMS messages
- Provide subscriber mobility
- Interconnect with next-generation networks

### Applications
- Fixed telephony
- 2G/3G mobile networks
- Interconnection with next-generation networks

## Potential Targets
According to GSMA Intelligence 2018, mobile connections by technology are widespread, making various entities vulnerable to attacks.

## Hacker Capabilities
Hackers can:
- Easily access email and social media accounts
- Track the location of VIPs and public figures
- Perform massive denial of service attacks
- Intercept private data, calls, and SMS messages
- Steal money
- Take control of digital identities

## History of Signaling Security
- **Early SS7 Development:** Trusted environment with no security mechanisms in the protocol stack.
- **SIGTRAN Introduction:** SS7 over IP introduced, but security was still lacking.
- **Growing Scope:** Increasing number of SS7 connections and traffic, with no security policies or restrictions.
- **Current State:** Numerous MNOs, MVNOs, and VAS providers, with SS7 and Diameter widely used, but security remains insufficient.

## Mobile Operators and SS7 Security
### Security Measures
- **Security Assessment:** Regular evaluations to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Signaling IDS:** Intrusion detection systems to monitor and alert on suspicious activities.
- **SMS Home Routing:** Prevents SMS fraud and hides IMSI identities.
- **Security Configuration:** Proper configuration of network elements.
- **SS7 Firewall:** Protects against a wide range of threats, including IMSI disclosure, location tracking, and traffic interception.

### Basic Nodes and Identifiers
- **HLR (Home Location Register):** Stores subscriber information.
- **MSC/VLR (Mobile Switching Center and Visited Location Register):** Manages call routing and roaming.
- **SMS-C (SMS Centre):** Handles SMS message delivery.
- **MSISDN (Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Number):** Unique identifier for mobile devices.
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity):** Unique identifier for SIM cards.
- **STP (Signaling Transfer Point):** Routers that relay SS7 messages.
- **GT (Global Title):** Address of a core node element.

### SS7 Protocol Stack
- **SCCP (Signaling Connection Control Part):** Routes signaling messages using Global Titles.
- **TCAP (Transaction Capabilities Application Part):** Processes transactions and dialogues.
- **MAP (Mobile Application Part):** Contains operation codes and parameters such as IMSI, profile information, and location data.

## SS7 Security Tools
### SS7 Firewall
- **Functionality:** Protects against threats like IMSI disclosure, location tracking, and traffic interception.
- **Deployment:** Typically placed at the border of the signaling network.

### SMS Home Routing
- **Functionality:** Prevents SMS fraud and hides IMSI identities.
- **Deployment:** Configured to route SMS messages securely.

### Signaling Transfer Point (STP)
- **Functionality:** Relays SS7 messages between signaling end-points and other STPs.
- **Screening Rules:** Simple rules to block or redirect signaling messages based on source addresses or operation codes.

## SMS Delivery Process
### Normal Process
1. **SRI4SM Request (SendRoutingInfoForSM):** MSISDN sent from MSC to HLR.
2. **SRI4SM Response:** IMSI and MSC address returned from HLR to MSC.
3. **MT-SMS (Mobile Terminated SMS):** SMS text sent from SMS-C to MSC.

### SRI4SM Abuse
1. **SRI4SM Request:** MSISDN sent from MSC to HLR.
2. **SRI4SM Response:** Fake IMSI and SMS-R address returned from HLR to MSC.
3. **MT-SMS:** SMS text sent from SMS-C to MSC using fake IMSI.

### SMS Home Routing Against Malefactors
1. **SRI4SM Request:** MSISDN sent from MSC to HLR.
2. **SRI4SM Response:** Fake IMSI and SMS-R address returned from HLR to MSC.
3. **MT-SMS:** SMS text sent from SMS-C to MSC using real IMSI.

## SS7 Firewall: Typical Deployment Scheme
- **HLR, STP, and MSC:** SS7 firewall placed between these nodes to filter and block malicious messages.

### Blocking Rules
- **Category 1:** Block a message by an operation code.
- **Category 2:** Block a message by an operation code and correlation of a source address and subscriber identity.
- **Category 3:** Block a message by an operation code and subscriber’s real location.

## SS7 Attacks and Vulnerabilities
### IMSI Disclosure
- **Exploitation of Malformed ACN (Application Context Name):** TCAP protocol vulnerabilities allow IMSI disclosure.
- **Location Tracking:** Substitution of Operation Code Tag for tracking.
- **Voice Call Interception (MiTM):** Exploitation of Double MAP vulnerability.

### Example: IMSI Disclosure via Malformed ACN
1. **SRI4SM Request:** MSISDN sent with malformed ACN.
2. **SRI4SM Response:** IMSI and MSC address returned.
3. **Bypass SMS Router:** Equal IMSIs indicate the absence or non-involvement of SMS Home Routing.

### Location Tracking
- **Substitution of Operation Code Tag:** Uses global and local operation codes to track locations.

### Voice Call Interception (MiTM)
- **Double MAP Vulnerability:** Manipulates TCAP components to intercept voice calls.

## Main Issues in SS7 Security
- **Architecture Flaws:** Inherent design weaknesses.
- **Configuration Mistakes:** Incorrect setup of network elements.
- **Software Bugs:** Errors in software implementations.

## Conclusion
1. **Regularly Check Security Tools:** Ensure they are effective against new vulnerabilities.
2. **Use Intrusion Detection Solutions:** Along with SS7 firewalls to detect and block threats promptly.
3. **Block TCAP Begin Messages:** With double MAP components, except for legal pairs like BeginSubscriberActivity + ProcessUnstructuredSS-Data.
4. **Careful Configuration:** Pay attention to malformed Application Context Names and Global OpCodes.
