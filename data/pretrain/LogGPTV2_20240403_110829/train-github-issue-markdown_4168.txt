Hey Guys, I just noticed an upgrade to 4.2.0 from 4.1.1 causes breaking
changes. Any ideas where this was intoduced?
System:  
OSX 10.13.5  
Anaconda Python 3.7
## Steps to reproduce
Install:
    $ pip install Celery=4.2.0
Code:
    celery_amqp_url=os.getenv("CELERY_AMQP_URL")
    app = Celery('magic_worker',broker=celery_amqp_url)
    @task
    def parse(uid):
        print('parsing: %s' % uid)
Run:
    $ celery -A magic_worker worker
## Expected behavior
Celery task is consumed.
## Actual behavior
Error throw:

## Work Around
Downgrade to celery 4.1.1
    pip uninstall Celery
    pip install Celery=4.1.1
