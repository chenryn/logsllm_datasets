Subject: Breaking Changes in Celery 4.2.0 Upgrade

Dear Team,

I have encountered breaking changes after upgrading Celery from version 4.1.1 to 4.2.0. Could you please provide insights into where these changes were introduced?

### System Information
- **Operating System**: macOS 10.13.5
- **Python Environment**: Anaconda Python 3.7

### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Install Celery 4.2.0**:
   ```sh
   pip install Celery==4.2.0
   ```

2. **Code**:
   ```python
   celery_amqp_url = os.getenv("CELERY_AMQP_URL")
   app = Celery('magic_worker', broker=celery_amqp_url)

   @app.task
   def parse(uid):
       print(f'parsing: {uid}')
   ```

3. **Run the Celery Worker**:
   ```sh
   celery -A magic_worker worker
   ```

### Expected Behavior
The Celery task should be consumed and executed without errors.

### Actual Behavior
An error is thrown:
```

### Workaround
Downgrade to Celery 4.1.1:
```sh
pip uninstall Celery
pip install Celery==4.1.1
```

Thank you for your assistance.
