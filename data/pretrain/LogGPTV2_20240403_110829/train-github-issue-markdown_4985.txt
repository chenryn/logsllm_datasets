**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :  
The current merge count is different between _cat/nodes and _stats/merges. We
show multiple merges being performed on the _cat/nodes api, however,
_stats/merges shows no merges being performed for any index. We are not sure
what is the true merge activity on the cluster. Also, is there a way to see
what shards are bing merged?

**Steps to reproduce** :  
We are not sure how the cluster gets into this state. We have experienced this
multiple times. We have not found a way to clear what we think are stuck
merges without bouncing the nodes.
