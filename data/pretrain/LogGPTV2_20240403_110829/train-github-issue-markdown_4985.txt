### Elasticsearch Version
1.7.5

### JVM Version
1.8.0_40-64

### OS Version
CentOS 6

### Description of the Problem
**Expected Behavior:**
- The merge count reported by the `_cat/nodes` and `_stats/merges` APIs should be consistent.
- We should be able to see which shards are being merged.

**Actual Behavior:**
- The `_cat/nodes` API shows multiple merges in progress, but the `_stats/merges` API reports no ongoing merges for any index.
- This discrepancy makes it difficult to determine the true merge activity on the cluster.
- Additionally, we are unsure how to identify which specific shards are being merged.

**Screenshots:**
- **_cat/nodes API Output:**

- **_stats/merges API Output:**

### Steps to Reproduce
- We have not been able to consistently reproduce this issue.
- The cluster occasionally enters this state, and we have experienced it multiple times.
- We have not found a way to clear what we believe are stuck merges without restarting the nodes.

### Logs (if relevant)
- Please provide any relevant logs that may help in diagnosing the issue.
