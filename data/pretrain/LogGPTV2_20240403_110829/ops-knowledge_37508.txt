User: Please analyze how to use Python scripts to read and write files, and provide an example code.
Assistant: Python provides many built-in functions for reading and writing files, such as open(), read(), write(), etc. When using these functions to read and write files, you need to pay attention to the file operation mode, such as 'r' means read mode, 'w' means write mode, 'a' means append mode, etc. Below is a simple Python code example to read data from a text file and write data to another file. ```python # Open the original file and the target file with open('input.txt', 'r') as input_file, open('output.txt', 'w') as output_file: # Read the original file line by line for line in input_file: # Process each line of data processed_line = process_line(line) # Write the processed data to the target file output_file.write(processed_line + '\n') ``` In this example, we use with statement opens two files, the original and the destination. Using the with statement can ensure that the file is automatically closed after use, avoiding the common file leakage problem in actual development. Next, we use a for loop to read the data in the original file line by line, and process each line of data. After processing the data, we use the write() function to write the processed data to the target file. It should be noted that when writing data, we need to manually add a newline character, otherwise all data will be written in the same line. Finally, when all the data is processed, the program will automatically close the original file and the target file to release file resources.
