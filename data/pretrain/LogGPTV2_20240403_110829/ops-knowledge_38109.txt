User: 请选择TimeSeriesClassification领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Analyze the following time series
[3,5,8,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,7,1,0,0,-1,-2,2,0,1,3,7,8,6,5,10,7,7,10,7,3,7,2,2,3,0,0,2,0,1,6,9,10,7,9,13,10,10,6,5,4]
Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Unable to determine
B: Sparse
C: Periodic
D: Stationary

Assistant: Answer: C

Explanation: According to the analysis, the time series in the question exhibits a pattern of periodic increase followed by a decrease. Therefore, it can be considered as cyclic type data. Hence, selecting option C is correct.
