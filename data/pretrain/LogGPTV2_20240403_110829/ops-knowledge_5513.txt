User: How to optimize website performance, improve website user experience and reduce service load?
Assistant: 1. Image optimization: Reduce image size as much as possible by compressing and scaling. 2. CDN acceleration: Using CDN to distribute static resources, such as pictures, CSS, script files, etc., can improve the access speed and stability of the website. 3. Compress and combine JS and CSS: Combine multiple CSS and JS files into one file, and use compression tools to compress the files, which can reduce HTTP requests and improve loading speed. 4. Limit the number of concurrent requests: Setting the maximum number of concurrent requests can control the number of requests processed by the server at the same time and reduce the server load. 5. Use cache: Using browser cache and server cache to store static resources and dynamic data can reduce HTTP requests and improve access speed. 6. Reduce HTTP requests: Merge files, cache files, and use CDN to reduce the number of HTTP requests as much as possible. 7. Server-side optimization: Configuring server parameters, using cache, and using load balancing can reduce server load and improve website performance. 8. Front-end performance optimization: Front-end optimizations such as reducing DOM elements, avoiding the use of Flash, and reducing page redrawing can effectively improve user experience and reduce service load. 9. Compress page data: Use Gzip and other compression algorithms to compress HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, which can reduce file size and improve page loading speed. 10. Use a web accelerator or acceleration plug-in: Use a web accelerator or browser plug-in to improve web page loading speed and responsiveness.
