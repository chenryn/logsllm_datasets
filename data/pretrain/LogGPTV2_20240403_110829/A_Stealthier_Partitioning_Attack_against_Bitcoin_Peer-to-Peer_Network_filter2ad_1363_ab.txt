describe the full version of the EREBUS attack. Unlike its
naive version, the EREBUS adversary uses not only the existing
Bitcoin nodes but any valid IP addresses whose victim-to-IP-
address routes include the adversary AS. For example, the
adversary AS M in Figure 1 can enumerate large numbers
of valid IP addresses in AS C and D and force the victim
node to peer with any of the enumerated IP addresses. We
call such adversary-enumerated IP addresses shadow IPs. A
shadow IP represents a virtual (thus, potentially non-existent)
Bitcoin node whose would-be victim-to-node route includes
the adversary AS. It is important to note that the shadow IPs
are not necessarily used by real Bitcoin nodes or even any host.
The shadow IPs are used only to provide a logical view of the
peer-to-peer network to the victim and any attempt to connect
to them from the victim node is hijacked and completed with
normal Bitcoin message exchanges by the adversary AS.
We describe the EREBUS attack in the following two attack
phases: a reconnaissance phase (Step I) and an attack execution
phase (Step II).
[Step I] Harvesting the shadow IPs (¬ßIV). In this reconnais-
sance step, the adversary aims to collect as many IP addresses
that can be used for the shadow IPs as possible. As illustrated
in Figure 2, this step consists of three substeps. In Step I-
¬ñ, the adversary evaluates the inter-domain routing state and
enumerates all the ASes that may have a node whose victim-
to-node packets would traverse its own network M . In Step
I-¬ó, the adversary enumerates all the available IP addresses
in the selected ASes and use them for the victim-speciÔ¨Åc
shadow IPs, and inserts them into its database. In Step I-¬ò,
the adversary tests if the packets from the victim node indeed
traverse its network towards the chosen shadow IPs. Note that
this test step can be integrated into the next attack execution
step. We show in Section IV that we can easily obtain tens or
hundreds of millions of shadow IPs for a large adversary AS
and a typical victim node.
[Step II] Creating victim-shadow peering connections (¬ßV).
In this attack execution step, the adversary aims to patiently
inÔ¨Çuence the victim node to make peering connections only
to the shadow IPs it has harvested in Step I. Note that the
control of Bitcoin‚Äôs peering decision with some botnets [29]
is no longer possible. Our EREBUS adversary exploits the
fundamental advantage of being a network adversary. That is,
the adversary AS impersonates the millions or more shadow
IPs reliably for several weeks to slowly Ô¨Åll up the internal
database of a victim node. In Step II-¬ñ, the adversary creates

Figure 2: Two main steps of the EREBUS attack. In the
Ô¨Årst reconnaissance step, a network adversary collects large
numbers of shadow IPs that are used to steer the existing peer
connections of the targeted victim Bitcoin node towards. In
the second step, the adversary gradually migrates the existing
peer connections of the victim node to the shadow IPs by
indirectly and patiently inÔ¨Çuencing the victim node‚Äôs peer
selection algorithm.
incoming connections with the victim node on behalf of
several shadow IPs of its choice. In particular, the adversary
initiates the Bitcoin version handshake by spooÔ¨Ång shadow
IP addresses. Then, in Step II-¬ó, the adversary Ô¨Çoods the
victim node‚Äôs internal IP address tables with a large number
of shadow IPs in addr messages. After Ô¨Ålling the internal
tables of the victim node, in Step II-¬ò, the adversary waits
for existing outgoing connections of the victim to be naturally
disconnected and replaced by the connections to shadow IPs.
To expedite the process, the adversary may trigger the victim
node to reset and choose new connections from the internal
tables.
D. Attack Properties
The EREBUS attack has three properties:
‚Ä¢ Undetectability. The biggest difference between the Bitcoin
hijacking attack [3] and the EREBUS attack is that
the
former is a control-plane only attack while the latter is
a data-plane only attack. The EREBUS adversary does
not propagate any control-plane messages (e.g., routing
announcements) and thus it
is completely invisible to

control-plane monitors, such as BGP message collectors and
analysis tools (e.g., RIPE [39], RouteView [47], CAIDA
BGPStream [37]). As the data-plane trafÔ¨Åc is much larger
in volume, there exists no public repository of data-plane
trafÔ¨Åc on the Internet, which makes the public scrutiny
for the EREBUS attack nearly impossible. Some cautious
and willing ASes may use their deep-packet
inspection
(DPI) capability to capture all the Bitcoin messages from a
suspicious AS and try to identify any suspicious data-plane
messages of the EREBUS attack (e.g., Bitcoin messages
exchanged in Step II in Figure 2). However, the EREBUS
adversary can always deny the execution of attacks because
there is no way to identify the actual originator of packets
without any accountable Internet architecture; e.g., [1], [48].
‚Ä¢ Immediate availability. The EREBUS attack is shown to
be readily available to any Tier-1 ASes against nearly all
(99.5%) of the 10K public Bitcoin nodes. Also, many large
Tier-2 ASes can target the majority of public Bitcoin nodes
in the network; see Section IV-B for our large-scale route
evaluations. The network coverage of the adversary ASes
matters because the larger the network coverage in the inter-
domain topology (e.g., Tier-1 ASes providing connectivity
to multiple continents), the more shadow IP addresses are
available in general for the EREBUS attack.
‚Ä¢ Lack of trivial countermeasures. As the EREBUS attack does
not exploit any speciÔ¨Åc protocol vulnerabilities but only the
fundamental topological advantage of a network adversary,
simple, quick Ô¨Åxes are hard to Ô¨Ånd. Our investigation in Sec-
tion VII shows that potentially effective countermeasures are
either violating the Bitcoin‚Äôs philosophy of decentralization
(e.g., reliance on third-party proxies) or requiring non-trivial
(also not-yet-validated) changes to Bitcoin core.
IV. HARVESTING SHADOW IPS
In the reconnaissance step, an adversary AS enumerates
shadow IP addresses for a victim node of its choice. Shadow
IPs are adversary-and-victim speciÔ¨Åc and thus each adversary-
victim pair has a unique set of shadow IPs that are determined
by the topological relationship of the pair (¬ßIV-A). We show
that many ASes (e.g., Tier-1 and large Tier-2 ASes) can
efÔ¨Åciently enumerate large numbers (e.g., millions or more) of
shadow IP addresses (¬ßIV-B). We also show that shadow IPs
are geographically well distributed (e.g., shadow IPs are found
in all Ô¨Åve continents), preventing the victim‚Äôs connections to
shadow IPs from looking suspicious (¬ßIV-C).
A. Enumerating Shadow IPs
The main goal of the attacker in the reconnaissance step
is to harvest all available shadow IP addresses. This requires
an inter-domain path inference to understand the trafÔ¨Åc routes
sent from the victim node, the enumeration of all shadow IPs,
and an optional veriÔ¨Åcation for those IP addresses.
1) Infer BGP paths from a victim node: The adversary
infers the inter-domain routes from the victim node to the
rest of the world to see if they include the adversary AS.
Notice that the adversary AS is required to be on the victim-
to-shadow paths but not necessarily on shadow-to-victim paths
because being on the victim-to-shadow paths is sufÔ¨Åcient for
impersonating the shadow IPs with IP address spooÔ¨Ång.
To infer the default AS-paths of the trafÔ¨Åc routes from the
AS hosting the victim node (e.g., AS V in Figure 2), the
adversary can simulate the BGP propagation between ASes
with a given AS topology and the widely assumed packet
forwarding policies of the current Internet; see below in this
section. We call the ASes, whose victim-to-themselves paths
include the adversary AS, shadow ASes; e.g., AS C, D, and
E in Figure 2.
2) Collect all shadow IPs: From the inferred shadow ASes,
the adversary enumerates all shadow IPs owned by the shadow
ASes and stores them into her database.
3) Test
if shadow node IPs are usable: The collected
shadow IPs are inferred results of the BGP route simulations,
which may contain some errors. Hence, the attacker may want
to verify that the adversary AS is indeed on the trafÔ¨Åc routes
from the victim node to the shadow node IPs. The adversary
can easily test it by establishing a connection (e.g., TCP) with
the victim node on behalf of a supposedly shadow IP chosen
from a shadow AS. If the adversary does not receive any
packet (e.g., SYN/ACK) from the victim, she discards such
unusable shadow IPs and their preÔ¨Åxes. This sub-step can be
also done during the attack execution phase (see Section V).
B. How Many Shadow IPs are Available?
We evaluate how many shadow IPs are available for various
adversary-victim pairs through a comprehensive large-scale
BGP route simulations. We also investigate how the shadow
IPs are distributed, which is measured by the number of unique
preÔ¨Åx groups (i.e., the /16 of IPv4 addresses or /32 IPv6
addresses) within the entire shadow IPs pool. The number of
preÔ¨Åx groups is important for the EREBUS attack because IPs
in the same group can occupy only a small part of the Bitcoin
node‚Äôs peer database.
Evaluation setup. To infer the inter-domain routing between
ASes, we start by building the Internet topology of about 60K
ASes by using the CAIDA inferred AS business relationship
dataset [6], which describes the connectivity among ASes
based on their business relationships: provider, customer, peer
or sibling. We simulate the propagation of BGP advertisement
messages from all ASes, allowing all ASes to calculate the
default AS paths for the trafÔ¨Åc sending to each other. We
assume that ASes apply the widely-perceived BGP policies
in order [22], [25]: (1) customer links are preferred over peer
links and peer links are preferred over provider links; (2) the
shortest AS-path length route is preferred; and (3) if multiple
best paths exist, an arbitrary method (e.g., AS numbers) is
used to break the tie.
We create two sets of attacker-victim ASes pairs for this
evaluation. First, we consider the adversaries are Tier-1 ASes
and the victim ASes are all ASes on the Internet hosting at
least one Bitcoin node [26], making this set contains about
24K of pairs in total. Second, we select the largest 100 ASes

IPs (including both existing, real Bitcoin IPs and virtual IPs)
that can be used for the EREBUS attacks. Figure 3a shows
