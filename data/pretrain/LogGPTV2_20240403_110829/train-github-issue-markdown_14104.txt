Subject: Issue with Image Download on Specific Devices Using Glide

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue I have encountered while using the Glide library for image downloading and caching in my application.

**Issue Description:**
On certain devices, specifically the Moto X, images are not being downloaded correctly. An example of this issue is illustrated in the attached screenshot. However, when I use `skipMemoryCache(true)`, the problem seems to be resolved as it forces Glide to download the image again.

**Steps Taken:**
- I have already tried using `asBitmap()` along with `imageDecoder()`, but the problem persists.
- Interestingly, this issue does not occur on my Nexus 4, where Glide functions perfectly.
- Additionally, I configured a listener to log any exceptions, but the `onException()` method was never called, indicating that no exceptions were thrown. This makes the situation quite perplexing.

If you could provide any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this, it would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
