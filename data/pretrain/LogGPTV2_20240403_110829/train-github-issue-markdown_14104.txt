Hi,  
In some devices (Moto X) do not download correctly, like the screenshot
attached.  
When i skipMemoryCache(true) it works, because Glide download the image again.  
I already use asBitmap() with imageDecoder() and the problem still occur.
But, in my other device (Nexus 4) this problem doesn't occur. Glide works
perfectly
I tried to config listener() to log Exceptions but never called onException()
method. In other words, no Exceptions occurs. Its weird.
Best,  
Thiago Luis.
