### Default Address Group and Filters
By default, an address group is created to include all incoming IP addresses. Filters applied to this group will affect all incoming network traffic. You can create additional groups based on source or destination IP addresses. For more information, see “Creating an Address Group” on page 50.

### Step 4: Add Filters to the IP Filter List
Refer to “Understanding Firewall Filters” on page 45 to learn how IP filters work and how to create them. This step allows you to enhance network security, manage network traffic, and support other services. For detailed instructions on creating a new filter, see “Creating an Advanced IP Filter for TCP Ports” on page 51.

**Important:** If you add or change a filter after starting the firewall service, it will affect existing connections. For example, if you deny all access to your FTP server, computers already connected to it will be disconnected.

### Step 5: Save Firewall Service Changes
After configuring your filters and determining which services to allow, save your changes to apply the new settings.

### Managing Firewall Service
This section provides step-by-step instructions for starting, stopping, and configuring firewall address groups and filters.

#### Starting and Stopping Firewall Service
By default, the firewall service blocks all incoming TCP connections and allows all UDP connections. Before enabling the firewall service, ensure that you have set up filters to allow access from specific IP addresses. Otherwise, no one will be able to access your server.

**To start or stop the firewall service:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Start Firewall**.
   - When the service is started, the **Stop Service** button becomes available.

#### Opening the Firewall for Standard Services
By default, the firewall service blocks all incoming TCP connections and allows all UDP connections. Ensure you have set up filters to allow access from specific IP addresses before enabling the firewall service.

You can easily allow standard services through the firewall without extensive configuration. Standard services include:
- Web service
- Apple File service
- Windows File service
- FTP service
- Printer Sharing
- DNS/Rendezvous
- ICMP Echo Reply (incoming pings)
- IGMP (Internet Gateway Multicast Protocol)
- PPTP VPN
- L2TP VPN
- QTSS media streaming
- iTunes Music Sharing

**To open the firewall for standard services:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Select the **Any** address group.
   - If you want to restrict or designate IP addresses for a standard service, create an address group instead of using the **Any** address group. See “Creating an Address Group” on page 50 for more information.
5. Select the services you want to allow.
6. Click **Save**.

### Creating an Address Group
You can define groups of IP addresses for your firewall filters. These groups help organize and target the filters. The default address group includes all addresses.

IP addresses can be listed as individual addresses (e.g., 192.168.2.2) or in CIDR format (e.g., 192.168.2.0/24).

**To create an address group:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Click **Add** beneath the **Address Group** pane.
5. Enter a group name.
6. Enter the addresses and subnet mask you want the filters to apply to.
7. Click **OK**.

**Important:** If you add or change a filter after starting the firewall service, it will affect existing connections. For example, if you deny all access to your FTP server, computers already connected to it will be disconnected.

### Editing or Deleting an Address Group
You can edit or delete address groups to modify the range of IP addresses affected. The default address group includes all addresses. Removing an address group also deletes the associated filters.

**To edit or delete an address group:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Select the group name from the **Address Group** pane.
5. Click the **Edit** button beneath the **Address Group** pane to edit it, or click the **Delete** button to delete it.
6. Edit the group name or addresses as needed.
7. Click **OK**.
8. Click **Save**.

### Duplicating an Address Group
You can duplicate address groups to speed up the configuration of similar address groups.

**To duplicate an address group:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Select the group name from the **Address Group** pane.
5. Click the **Duplicate** button beneath the **Address Group** pane.

### Creating an Advanced IP Filter for TCP Ports
You can use the **Advanced Settings** pane to configure specific filters for TCP ports. IP filters include an IP address and a subnet mask. You can apply a filter to all IP addresses, a specific IP address, or a range of IP addresses.

**To create an IP filter for TCP ports:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Click the **New** button.

5. Choose whether the filter will allow or deny access in the **Action** pop-up menu.
6. Select **TCP** from the **Protocol** pop-up menu.
7. Choose a TCP service from the pop-up menu, or select **Other** for a nonstandard service port.
8. If desired, choose to log packets that match the filter.
9. Enter the **Source IP** address range you want to filter.
   - If you want it to apply to any address, choose **Any** from the pop-up menu.
   - If you selected a nonstandard service port, enter the source port number.
10. Enter the **Destination IP** address range you want to filter.
    - If you want it to apply to any address, choose **Any** from the pop-up menu.
    - If you selected a nonstandard service port, enter the destination port number.
11. Choose which network interface this filter applies to.
12. Click **OK**.
13. Click **Save** to apply the filter immediately.

### Creating an Advanced IP Filter for UDP Ports
You can use the **Advanced Settings** pane to configure specific filters for UDP ports. By default, all UDP connections are allowed. Be cautious when applying filters to UDP ports, as "deny" filters can cause severe congestion in your server traffic.

**To create an IP filter for UDP ports:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Click the **New** button.

6. Select **UDP** from the **Protocol** pop-up menu.
7. Choose a UDP service from the pop-up menu, or select **Other** for a nonstandard service port.
8. If desired, choose to log packets that match the filter.
9. Enter the **Source IP** address range you want to filter.
   - If you want it to apply to any address, choose **Any** from the pop-up menu.
   - If you selected a nonstandard service port, enter the source port number.
10. Enter the **Destination IP** address range you want to filter.
    - If you want it to apply to any address, choose **Any** from the pop-up menu.
    - If you selected a nonstandard service port, enter the destination port number.
11. Choose which network interface this filter applies to.
12. Click **OK**.
13. Click **Save** to apply the filter immediately.

### Editing Advanced IP Filters
If you edit a filter after turning on the firewall service, your changes will affect existing connections. For example, if you change the filter to deny all access to the server, connected computers will be disconnected.

**To edit advanced IP filters:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **Advanced** tab.
4. Select a filter and click **Duplicate**, **Edit**, or **Delete**. If you’re deleting a filter, you’ve finished.
5. Make any necessary changes, then click **Save**.

### Changing the Default Filter
If the server receives a packet using a port or IP address to which none of your filters apply, the firewall service uses the **Default** filter. You can set the **Default** filter to either deny or allow these packets for specific IP addresses. By default, the **Default** filter denies access.

**To change the **Default** setting:**
1. In Server Admin, select **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
