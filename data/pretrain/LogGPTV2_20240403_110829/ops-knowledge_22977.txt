User: How to configure IP address and DNS server on CentOS system.
Assistant: 1. First, open the terminal and log in to the system as the root user. 2. Edit the network configuration file with the following command: `vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` In the file, find the following line: ``` BOOTPROTO=dhcp ONBOOT=yes ``` replace `BOOTPROTO` Change to `static` and add the following lines: ``` IPADDR=192.168.1.100 NETMASK=255.255.255.0 GATEWAY=192.168.1.1 ``` These values should be modified accordingly for your network environment to ensure proper configuration. For example, if your IP address is `192.168.0.10`, you should enter that value in the `IPADDR` line. 3. Add the following line at the end, add the DNS server address you want to use: `DNS1=8.8.8.8` If you need to use multiple DNS servers, you can use the following line: ``` DNS1=8.8.8.8 DNS2=8.8.4.4 ``` 4. Save and close the file. Restart the network service with the following command for the changes to take effect: `service network restart` Your CentOS system should now be properly configured with IP addresses and DNS servers.
