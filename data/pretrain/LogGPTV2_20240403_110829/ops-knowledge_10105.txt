Assistant: This log chunk shows that a node was running from 2005-10-02 to 2005-11-06, then it stopped responding from 2005-11-05 to 2005-11-09. The partition was blocked on 2005-11-03 and running from 2005-11-06 to 2005-11-09. The node was active on 2005-11-09 and configured out on 2005-11-16. The domain was not responding on 2005-11-16. Finally, the partition was running on 2005-11-29.
