### Models and Techniques for Location Privacy

Several models have been proposed [34] to achieve privacy through a peer-to-peer scheme, where users avoid querying the service provider if they can find the requested information among their peers.

Differential Privacy (DP) has also been applied in the context of location privacy, primarily to protect aggregate location data. For example, [35] presents a method to statistically simulate location data from a database while ensuring privacy. In [36], a quad tree spatial decomposition technique is used to achieve DP in a database with location pattern mining capabilities. Dewri [37] combines differential privacy and k-anonymity to hide the location of a single individual, requiring that the distances between the probability distributions corresponding to k fixed locations (defined as the anonymity set) should not exceed the privacy parameter ε.

The work most closely related to ours is [38], which independently proposes a linear programming technique to construct optimal obfuscation mechanisms with respect to either AdvError or geo-indistinguishability. Although there is an overlap in the main construction (the optimization problem in Section 3.1), most of the results are substantially different. The approximation technique in [38] involves discarding some geo-indistinguishability constraints when the involved distance exceeds a certain lower bound, affecting the privacy guarantees. Our approximation technique, based on spanning graphs, reduces the number of constraints from cubic to quadratic without compromising privacy, by accepting a small decrease in utility. Additionally, we show that the mechanism obtained from this optimization problem is also optimal with respect to AdvError (Theorem 2). The evaluation methods differ: [38] uses prior distributions with varying levels of entropy, while we combine the user's distribution (assumed known by the adversary) with publicly available information (e.g., time of day).

Finally, dX-privacy has been used in [39] to capture fairness rather than privacy. The goal is to construct a fair mechanism that produces similar reported values for "similar" users, with similarity defined by a metric. Similar to our work, the construction involves solving an optimization problem, but no technique is used to reduce the number of constraints.

### Evaluation

We evaluated our approach using the T-Drive dataset, which contains traces of 10,357 taxis in Beijing, China, over one week. The total distance of the traces is about 9 million kilometers, with more than 15 million reported points. The average time between consecutive points in a trace is 177 seconds, and the average distance is 623 meters. Due to the large number of users, we randomly selected 5% (about 532 users out of 10,357) for the evaluation. We followed the steps described in Section 4.2.

**Figure 6** shows the boxplot of location privacy for the T-Drive dataset. The median value of location privacy for OptQL is consistently as good as or better than that of other mechanisms. Specifically, the median value for OptQL is always higher than that for PL.

**Figure 7** compares the quality loss of OptQL and PL mechanisms for different values of ε using the T-Drive dataset. The quality loss of OptQL is always smaller than that of PL.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we developed a method to generate a location privacy mechanism that combines the advantages of geo-indistinguishability [9] and the optimal mechanism [8]. To address the computational demands of linear optimization, we provided a technique to reduce the number of constraints using a spanning graph to approximate distances, significantly reducing the number of constraints with only a small decrease in utility. We evaluated our approach using real user traces and compared both the privacy and running time of our mechanism with that of [8]. Our mechanism offers better privacy guarantees when the attacker's side knowledge differs from the distribution used to construct the mechanisms. Additionally, for a reasonably good approximation factor, our approach performs much better in terms of running time.

### Appendix

In this section, we present the dual form of the optimization problem discussed in Section 3.2. The original linear program is as follows:

**Minimize:**
\[
\sum_{x, z \in X} \pi_x k_{xz} d_Q(x, z)
\]

**Subject to:**
\[
\sum_{x \in X} k_{xz} = 1 \quad \forall z \in X
\]
\[
k_{xz} \geq 0 \quad \forall x, z \in X
\]
\[
e^{-\delta d_G(x, x')} k_{x'z} - k_{xz} \leq \pi_x \quad \forall z \in X, (x, x') \in E
\]

To obtain the dual form, we apply the standard technique of linear programming. We introduce two sets of variables:
- Variables of the form \(a_{xx'z}\) for \(z \in X, (x, x') \in E\)
- Variables of the form \(b_x\) for \(x \in X\)

The dual linear program is then:

**Maximize:**
\[
\sum_{x, z \in X} b_x
\]

**Subject to:**
\[
\sum_{x \in X} a_{xx'z} \leq \pi_x \quad \forall z \in X, (x, x') \in E
\]
\[
\sum_{(x, x') \in E} (e^{-\delta d_G(x, x')} a_{x'xz} - a_{xx'z}) + b_x \leq d_Q(x, z) \quad \forall x, z \in X
\]
\[
a_{xx'z} \geq 0 \quad \forall z \in X, (x, x') \in E
\]
\[
b_x \geq 0 \quad \forall x \in X
\]

This dual form allows us to solve the optimization problem more efficiently.
