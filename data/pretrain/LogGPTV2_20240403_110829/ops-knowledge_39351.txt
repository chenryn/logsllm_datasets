Assistant: According to the above description, I designed the following blog publishing system based on the Python Flask framework: 1. User registration and login: 1.1 Registration page: On the registration page, users can fill in the user name, email number and password to complete their registration. 1.2 Login page: On the login page, users can enter the user name and password they filled in during registration to complete the login operation. 1.3 Forgot Password: Users can fill in their registered email address and receive a reset password link in the email address. Follow the link to reset your password. 1.4 User information management: After logging in, users can see their own blogs, maintain and modify personal information, display the time when personal blogs were created, and other functions. 2. Publish and manage blogs: 2.1 Blog publishing: Logged-in users can publish their own blogs on the "Publish Blog" page, set titles, categories, content and other information, and preview them. 2.2 Blog management: Logged-in users can edit, delete, and query their own blogs on the background management page, and can also manage categories and change drafts of blogs. 2.3 Blog detail page: Users can visit each blog detail page to browse blog title, author, classification, content, comments and like information. 3. Blog category: 3.1 Category browsing: Users can browse blogs according to different categories on the blog category page. 3.2 Category management: Logged-in users can manage their own blog categories, and perform operations such as modifying, deleting, and creating categories. 4. Reading volume statistics: 4.1 Statistical function: The system can automatically count the reading volume of each blog, and display it online on the background management page. 4.2 Latest release: The system can automatically list the latest blogs according to rules such as reading volume and release time. 5. Responsive design: 5.1 Adaptive: The blog publishing system will display adaptively according to the user's device type and resolution, ensuring that users can access and use the blog on any device. 6. Prevent malicious attacks: 6.1 SQL injection: The system uses ORM technology to automatically convert SQL statements before executing them, thus avoiding common SQL injection attacks. 6.2 XSS attack: The system will escape the content entered by the user in the input box such as blog, so as to avoid XSS attack. 6.3 CSRF attack: The system will automatically generate a random Token value when the user visits each page, so as to avoid CSRF attack. 7.

Blog recommendation: 8.1 Recommendation algorithm: The system can automatically recommend interested blogs based on machine learning based on user reading history, likes, comments and other data. 8.2 Recommendation rules: Recommend related categories, tags, popular blogs and other information based on the user's current visit page or published blog page.
