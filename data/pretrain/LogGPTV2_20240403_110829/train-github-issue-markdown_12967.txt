I would like to be able to capture (or cancel) the native file open dialog.  
It is possible for 'download/save' by catching the 'will-download' event. I
would like the same for the file selection.
Basically I need to control all native UI element (popup, dialogs, ...).  
Does it make sense?
thanks.
