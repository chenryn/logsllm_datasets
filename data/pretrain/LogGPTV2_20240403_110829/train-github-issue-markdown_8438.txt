Hi!
My entry module uses a dynamic require, which forces Webpack to try to build
every file under the context directory into one gigantic bundle. Is there a
way to restrict which files webpack tries to bundle in this case? For example,
ignoring any files underneath various test directories? Is there also a way to
force webpack to split these files out into several bundles?
I think, because the dynamic require is so ambiguous, Webpack determines that
every file within the context directory should be bundled with the entry file
so that they're all available should the dynamic require need them. That makes
plenty of sense, but at some point I'd like `require` to send off an ajax
request for the next bundle. How can I force that?
Thanks!
