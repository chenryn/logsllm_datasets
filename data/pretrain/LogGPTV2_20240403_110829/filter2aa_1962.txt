## The Problem
A certificate can outlive the ownership of a domain, potentially leaving the new domain owner with a valid SSL certificate issued to the previous owner. How can you know if this is the case?

### Historical Context
- In the early 2000s and 2010s, there was no way to determine if a domain had pre-existing certificates.
- Example:
  - Alice registers `foo.com` for one year.
  - Bob later registers `foo.com`.
  - Alice's three-year SSL certificate for `foo.com` remains valid even after the domain registration expires.

### Solution: Certificate Transparency (CT)
- **Certificate Transparency** is a log of all certificates issued by public Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- It is designed to catch bad or misbehaving CAs and is publicly auditable and searchable.
- There are over half a billion certificates in CT logs, and the number is growing.

### Identifying Pre-existing Certificates
- **Steps:**
  1. Note the purchase date of the domain.
  2 - Search CT logs for certificates that pre-date the purchase date but are still valid.
  3. Monitor the logs, as old certificates may not show up for years, if ever.

### Case Study: stripe.com
- A significant example of this issue is `stripe.com`.

### Data Analysis
- **Scope:**
  - 3 million domains (approximately 1% of the internet).
- **Metrics:**
  - Expiration dates
  - Email contacts
  - Registrar changes
  - Etc.
- **Sources:**
  - CT logs
  - Historical WHOIS data
  - Historical nameservers: [dns.coffee](https://dns.coffee)
  - WayBack Machine: [archive.org](https://archive.org)

### Findings
- 1.5 million (0.45%) of the tested domains have pre-existing certificates.
- 25% of these certificates have not yet expired.

### BygoneSSL
- **Definition:** An SSL certificate created before and superseding its domain's current registration date.
- **Potential Issues:**
  - Certificates can include multiple domains.
  - Some domains on the certificate may be bygone, while others are not.

### Impact and Mitigation
- **Revoke Certificates?**
  - If not, the new domain owner could face significant issues, including:
    - Spending $10,000 on a domain only to find it unusable for years.
    - Bad actors squatting on desirable domains.
  - If yes, the following risks arise:
    - Taking down production certificates you don’t own.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on companies.

### CA and Browser Rules
- **Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates:**
  - CAs must revoke certificates within 24 hours if information becomes incorrect.
  - Browsers will distrust CAs that break these rules.

### DoS Attacks
- **Example:**
  - A certificate for `bar.com` can be revoked because it is shared with `foo.com`, which has changed ownership during the certificate's lifetime.
- **Findings:**
  - 7 million (2.05%) of domains share a certificate with bygone domains.
  - 41% of these certificates have not yet expired.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- **Scenario:**
  - If a company acquires a previously owned domain, the previous owners could still have valid certificates.
  - They can perform a MitM attack using the previous owner's certificate.

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
- **Scenario:**
  - If a certificate has a subject alternative name (SAN) for a domain no longer owned, the certificate can be revoked, leading to a DoS attack if the shared certificate is still in use.

### Revoke Attempts
- **Let’s Encrypt:**
  - Instant automated turnaround.
- **Digicert:**
  - 1-day turnaround.
- **Amazon AWS:**
  - 1-week turnaround.
- **Comodo:**
  - Still waiting.
- **Resellers:**
  - 1-week turnaround.

### Unanswered Questions
- **Notice Period for Revocation:**
  - How much notice should be given?
- **Revocation Effectiveness:**
  - Our demo certificate has been revoked for months but still works fine.

### Protection Measures
- **Domain Owners:**
  - Use the `Expect-CT` HTTP header with enforce to ensure only CT-logged certificates are trusted.
  - Request the CA to revoke previous owners' certificates if they are in CT logs.
  - Continuously monitor CT logs for old certificates.
  - Use CertSpotter with BygoneSSL to monitor logs.

- **Internet Community:**
  - Registrars could show pre-existing certificates for domain registrations, including related alt-names.
  - CAs should issue short-lived certificates (e.g., Let’s Encrypt).
  - CAs should not issue certificates valid for longer than the domain registration.
  - Be cautious with subject alternative names (SANs).
