The Problem
A certificate can outlive a the ownership of a domain
This potentially leaves the domain owner with a valid SSL certificate for the next owner
How can you know?
●
Buy a new domain… hope for the best?
●
In the early 2000’s and early 2010’s, you’d never know
Alice registers foo.com for 1 year
Bob registers foo.com
Alice’s 3 year SSL certificate for foo.com
foo.com unregistered
Bob’s certificate for foo.com
Certificate Transparency!
●
Log of all certificates issued by public Certificate Authorities
●
Designed to catch bad or misbehaving Certificate Authorities
●
Publicly auditable and searchable
●
½ billion certs and growing
We Can find pre-existing certificates
●
Note the purchase date of said domain
●
Search CT logs for certs pre-dating that date and valid after
●
Monitor
○
Old certs may not show up in logs for years, if ever
A significant example
stripe.com
How big is this issue?
Searched Certificate Transparency (CT)  for certificates that overlap multiple 
domain registrations

WayBack Machine https://archive.org
1.5M  (0.45%)
Of domains tested have pre-existing certificates
25% haven't expired yet
BygoneSSL
noun
An SSL certificate created before and supersedes 
its domains’ current registration date
Could it be worse?
●
Certificates can have many domains 
●
Certificates can contain some bygone domains and some not
Cert
foo.com
bar.com
foo.com
bar.com
CertGraph Example of BygoneSSL

Example: do.com
Can we revoke these certs?
If  no….
●
Spend 10k on a domain, you’re screwed for years
●
Bad guys could squat on desirable domains
●
Cry 
If  yes…
●
You can take down production certs you don’t own
●
You can DoS companies
Digging deeper....
●
Rules that dictate how CA’s and browsers operate
●
If broken browsers distrust the CA
Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates
Can revoke if information becomes incorrect

We can DoS production sites
Cert
foo.com
bar.com
foo.com
bar.com
Certificate for bar.com can be revoked because it is shared with 
foo.com which has changed ownership during the certificates lifetime
7M (2.05%)
Of domains share a certificate with bygone domains
41% haven't expired yet
Sounds like we can 
break stuff….
BygoneSSL
BygoneSSL Man in the Middle
If a company acquires a previously owned 
domain…
Previous owners could still have valid 
certificates
MitM the SSL connection with a certificate 
generated by the previous owner
BygoneSSL Denial of Service
If a certificate has a subject alt-name for a 
domain no longer owned…
Revoke the certificate with a vulnerable 
domain and non-vulnerable domain listed in 
the alternative names
You can DoS the service if the shared 
certificate is still in use!

Unanswered Questions
●
How do you give notice when revolving a certificate to its alt-names?
○
How much notice?
●
Revocation is broken a best....
○
Our demo certificate has been revoked for months, still works fine
Things you can do to protect your domain
●
Use the  Expect-CT HTTP header with enforce to ensure that only CT logged 
certs will be trusted for your domain
○
If a previous owners certificate is in CT logs, request the CA revoke it
■
Hope user checks CRL lists or OCSP
●
We should continuously monitor CT logs for old certs
○
CT has only been required for non-EV since April 2018
■
Only required for certificates issued after April
○
Check currently owned domains as well for older certificates
○
Use CertSpotter with BygoneSSL to monitor logs
Things the internet can do
●
Registrars could show pre-existing certificates for domain registrations
○
Include related alt-names
●
CAs could only issue short lived certificates
○
Let’s Encrypt!
●
CAs should not issue certificates valid for longer than domain registration
●
Be careful with subject alt-names
○
If you’re a hosting client domains, check CRL’s and replace certs as needed
