Lot of us currently using stable version and it would be much easier to
migrate each component separately.
So at the start we will be able to load components separately:
    import { Card, CardText, CardActions } from 'material-ui';  // 0.19.0
    import { Button } from "@material-ui/button"; // ^1.0.0
Idea from material-components.
Where user can install whole lib from `material-components-web` repo or each
component separately from `@material/*`.
