l GUI mode: A wizard steps you through the installation and configuration of Software Logger. You must 	have an X-Windows server installed on your OS to use GUI mode.
l Console mode: A command-line process steps you through the installation and configuration of Software 	Logger.Tip: Console mode may allow you to install Logger more quickly if you encounter bandwidth issues 
while installing remotely.
l Silent mode: You provide the input required for installation and configuration through a file. Therefore, you do not need to interact with the installer to complete the installation and configuration on each server. However, before you can use this mode, you must run the installation and configuration using one of the other modes to record the input in a file.Using GUI Mode to Install Software Logger
Make sure the machine on which you will be installing Logger complies with the specifications listed the Release Notes for your version, and that the prerequisites listed in "Prerequisites for Installation" on page25 are met.

Before you install, you must increase the user process limit on the OS, as described in "Increasing the User Process Limit and the Maximum Number of Open Files" on page27, and for RHEL7.X only, modify the logind.conf file, as described in "Editing the logind Configuration File for RHEL 7.X" on the previous page.You can verify that you have the correct installation file, as described in "Verifying the Downloaded Installation Software" on page24.
You can install Logger as a root user or as a non-root user. See "Prerequisites for Installation" on page25 for details and restrictions.
Note: If you will be installing the Software Logger using the GUI mode of installation with SSHconnection, enable the Xwindow forwarding using the -X option  to view the screens of the installation 
wizard. If you will be using PuTTY, an Xclient is required on the machine from which you are 
connecting to the machine onto which you want to install Logger.

5. The installer checks that installation prerequisites are met:l Operating system check—the installer checks to see if your device is running a supported operating system. If you are not, a message displays, but it does not prevent you from installing Logger software. This happens because some update scenarios start with an earlier OS. 
Note: Micro Focus ArcSight strongly recommends that you upgrade to a supported OS beforeinstalling. Refer to the Logger Support Matrix for a list of supported operating system 
platforms.
l Installation prerequisite check—If a check fails, Logger displays a message. You will need to fix the 	issue before proceeding.

Now that you are finished installing and initializing your Logger, you can use the URL you noted during the installation to connect to Logger. For instructions and information, see "Connecting to Software Logger" on page37.Using Silent Mode to Install Software Logger
Before you install Software Logger in silent mode, you need to create the properties file required for the silent mode installation. Once you have generated the file, you can use it for silent mode installations.
Licenses for Silent Mode InstallationsAs for any Logger installation, each silent mode installation requires a unique license file. You must obtain licenses as described in "Acquiring a License for Software Logger" on page25 and place them on the machines on which you will be installing Logger in silent mode, or ensure that the location where the licenses are placed is accessible from those machines.
Generating the Silent Install Properties FileTo generate a properties file for future silent installations:
1. Log in to the machine on which you will install Software Logger to generate an installation properties 	file.
If you want the silent mode installations to be done as root user, log in as root. Otherwise, log in as a non-root user.
2. Run these commands: 
chmod u+x ArcSight-logger-7.0.1.0.8316.0.bin
./ArcSight-logger-7.0.1.8316.0.bin -r The  is  directory location where the generated properties file called installer.properties should be placed.  You cannot specify or change this name.
3. Install Logger in GUI mode. See "Using GUI Mode to Install Software Logger" on page28.
4. Once the installation completes, navigate to the directory location you specified for theinstaller.properties file earlier. Then go to "Installing Software Logger in Silent Mode" on the next page.
The following is an example of a generated installer.properties file.

Installing Software Logger in Silent ModeMake sure the machine on which you will be installing the Software Logger complies with the platform requirements listed in the Release Notes for your version, and that the prerequisites listed in "Prerequisites for Installation" on page25 are met.
If you are installing as root, make sure the non-root user account you entered in previous steps exists on the machines on which you are using the silent installer to install Logger.To install the Software Logger using the Silent mode:
1. Copy the silent mode properties file  previously generated  to the same location  you have copied the 	Logger software.
2. Edit the LICENSE_LOCATION property in the properties file to include the location of license file. (A 	unique license file is required for each instance of installation.)
OrOr
Set the LICENSE_LOCATION property to point to a file, such as logger_license.zip. Then, for each instance of the silent mode installation, copy the relevant license file to the location and rename it to logger_license.zip. Doing so will avoid the need to update the combined properties file for each installation.
3. Run these commands from the directory where you copied the Logger software:chmod u+x ArcSight-logger-7.0.1.8316.0.bin
./ArcSight-logger-7.0.1.8316.0.bin -i SILENT -f 
The rest of the installation and configuration proceed silently, without requiring any input from you.
After the installation and initialization completes, you can use the URL created during the installation to connect to Logger. For instructions and information, see "Connecting to Software Logger" on the next page.Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 36 of 74
