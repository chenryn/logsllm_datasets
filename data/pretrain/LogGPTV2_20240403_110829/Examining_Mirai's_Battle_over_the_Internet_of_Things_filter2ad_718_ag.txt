combinations not seen in other variants, among which the com-
bination “admin,oelinux123”. This combination is targeted at the

EE 4GEE HH70 ROUTER, which is a mobile WiFi router especially
popular in Japan. Masuta on the other hand has only one unique
combination: “root,00000”, the default credentials used to login to
an old DVR. After adding this, the MASUTA botnet took over 2645
hosts in Vietnam in one single day, growing their botnet by a factor
4 from 810 infected to 3455 hosts.
Increasing your market share. Specializing on ASes pays off
6.2.2
when one is able to find networks with a large number of vulnerable
devices. After the initial foothold, variants seem to be effective in
maintaining the majority share of an AS, making the initial foothold
even more important. Botmasters can optimize their botnet for cer-
tain ASes by changing the credential list, and removing those that
will not be successful as bots execute a limited number of login
attempts. By doing so, the effectiveness in other ASes might be
impacted due to the deletion of important credentials. For MIORI,
Mirai and JOSHO, we have observed infected devices belonging
to the same variant from several ASes brute forcing our honey-
pots using different password lists, showing that malware authors
diversify and launch different versions to maximize effectiveness.

Another way to grow a botnet is by better targeting the scan-
ning activity towards vulnerable devices. While Mirai chose to
send packets to either port 23, or with 10% probability to 2323, we
observe botmasters removing either one of the two to make the
scan more focused towards one port. Removing 2323 does in theory
make sense, as Shodan reports there are more than 20 times as
many devices on port 23 than on 2323. We classify a host actively
avoiding a port when we have observed 44 packets but none on
the considered port, as this gives us a 99% chance the port should
have been observed, and find that mainly variants of Mirai and
JOSHO avoiding port 2323 with 7484 and 4558 hosts only scanning
23. On the other hand, we find 105 hosts belonging to MASUTA
only targeting port 2323. For hosts avoiding port 2323, we find no
difference in distribution over ASes.
6.2.3 Watching and learning from your competitors. If such strate-
gies are fruitful and actors are aware of the success, we would as-
sume those with a competitive advantage to proliferate. As unique
passwords are one success factor, we tracked how Mirai variants
introduced new credentials during our study, and whether others
would adopt these combinations to their own code base.
Figure 12 shows password adoption behavior of the largest Mi-
rai variants, and the smaller but particularly noteworthy strains
MM and OBJORN. The size of the connections shows the amount
of passwords that get transferred from one to the other, with the
color of the edge denoting the variant that pioneered the pass-
word. What immediately springs out is that all variants except
Mirai engage in password adoption, but that the two largest botnets
predominantly operate on credentials they have pioneered them-
selves. Mirai does not introduce external credentials at all and the
other large player MIORI borrows a minor share only from Mirai.

edges denote a credential adoption, edges are colored in the
color of the variant they came from.
