In the following discussions, we present the definitions of the secu-
rity properties of LASER. We provide the theorems corresponding
to each of the security properties of LASER, and the comprehensive
proofs of those theorems in the full length version of the paper
which is available at [16].
A.1 Correctness
The correctness property implies that a signature generated using
the login signature generation protocol by an unrevoked platform is
correctly verified using the verification algorithm, and is correctly
traced back to the platform, as defined below.
Definition A.1. For all λ, ms, ctl, cul, csr, M, and tRL, LASER
satisfies the correctness property if
(gpk, isk) ← Setup(1λ),
(tsk, hdl, tpk, mcl) ← MemCreGen(gpk, isk, ms),
(ctl′
, logCrej) ← LogCreGen(gpk, isk, ctl, tsk, hdl, tpk,
memCrej),∀j ∈ [1, ms],
(logCrej, cul′) ← SelectLogCre(lcl, cul, csr), and
σs ← Sign(gpk, tsk, hdl, tpk, logCrej, M), then
valid ← Verify(gpk, σs , M, tRL), and
true ← Identify(gpk, σs , M, tsk).
A.2 Adaptable Anonymity
The notion of adaptable anonymity consists of the following two
properties.
(1) Anonymity: This property requires that no entity (including the
issuer) is able to identify the platform which has generated a
given signature.
(2) Adaptable unlinkability: This notion requires that the platform
is able to adaptably control whether or not any two signatures
can be linked by a particular entity. For any two signatures,
the platform may select one of the following two properties of
adaptable unlinkability.
(a) Absolute unlinkability: The two signatures cannot be linked
either by the issuer or by the verifier.
(b) Conditional unlinkability: The two signatures cannot be
linked by the verifier, but they may or may not be linkable
by the issuer.
The definition of adaptable anonymity follows the definitions of
absolute and conditional unlinkability as presented below.
Definition A.2. For an adversary A and a challenger C, the ab-
solute unlinkability game is defined as follows.
(1) Setup: C simulates the Setup algorithm, and provides A with
the resulting isk and gpk. C also creates mt platforms with
identities Pi, ∀i ∈ [1, mt]. Further, C initializes a list of the cor-
rupted platforms, cpl = ∅, and a list of corrupted credentials,
ccl = ∅.
(2) MemCreGen: C acts as the platform, and simulates the protocol
MemCreGen with A which acts as the issuer. For all i ∈ [1, mt],
C generates tski, and acquires memCreij, ∀j ∈ [1, ms].
(4) Queries-Phase I: A queries C about the following.
(3) LogCreGen: C acts as the platform, and simulates the LogCreGen
protocol with A which acts as the issuer. For all i ∈ [1, mt] and
j ∈ [1, ms], C acquires logCreij.
(a) Sign: A requests C to generate a signature on a message M
on behalf of Pi. C runs the SelectLogCre with the credential-
selection rule conUnlink or absUnlink. If C utilizes the
rule absUnlink, it appends logCreij to ccl. Further, C
simulates the Sign protocol, and responds to A with the
signature σs.
(b) TskCorrupt: A requests C to provide the TPM’s secret key
of Pi. C responds to A with tski, and appends Pi to cpl.
(c) MemCreCorrupt: A requests the jth membership creden-
tial of platform Pi. C responds to A with memCreij, and
appends the corresponding logCreij to ccl.
(d) LogCreCorrupt: A requests the jth login credential of plat-
form Pi. C responds to A with logCreij, and appends
logCreij to ccl.
(5) Challenge: A submits to C a message M and two platforms
Pi0 and Pi1 with the restriction that Pi0, Pi1 (cid:60) cpl. C selects
ϕ ←$ {0, 1}. Here, ←$ represents a random selection. Corre-
sponding to Piϕ , C selects logCreiϕ jϕ using the credential-
selection rule absUnlink in the SelectLogCre algorithm such
(cid:60) ccl. Further, C runs the Sign protocol, and
that logCreiϕ jϕ
responds with the signature σs on M.
(6) Queries-Phase II (Restricted Queries): After obtaining the chal-
lenge, A continues to probe C with the queries mentioned in
Queries-Phase I, except for the TskCorrupt queries for tski0 and
tski1, MemCreCorrupt queries for memCrei0j0 and memCrei1j1,
and LogCreCorrupt queries for logCrei0j0 and logCrei1j1.
(7) Output: A outputs a bit ϕ′ indicating its guess of ϕ.
A wins the game if ϕ′ = ϕ, and the advantage of A is defined as
AdvabsA = |Pr(ϕ′ = ϕ) − 1/2|, where Pr represents the probability
of an event. LASER with the rule absUnlink satisfies the absolute
unlinkability property if the advantage of any probabilistic polyno-
mial time (PPT) adversary on winning the absolute unlinkability
game is negligibly small.
Definition A.3. For an adversary A and a challenger C, the con-
ditional unlinkability game is defined as follows.
(1) Setup: C simulates the Setup algorithm, and provides A with
the resulting gpk. C does not reveal isk to A. C also creates mt
platforms with identities Pi, ∀i ∈ [1, mt]. Further, C initializes
two lists cpl and ccl.
(2) MemCreGen: C acts as the platform as well as the issuer, and
simulates MemCreGen protocol to generate tski, ∀i ∈ [1, mt],
and memCreij, ∀i ∈ [1, mt], j ∈ [1, ms].
(3) LogCreGen: C acts as the platform as well as the issuer, and sim-
ulates LogCreGen protocol to generate logCreij, ∀i ∈ [1, mt]
and ∀j ∈ [1, ms].
(4) Queries-Phase I: A probes C with the queries defined in the
Queries-Phase I in the absolute unlinkability game. A probes C
with the following additional queries.
(a) Revoke: A requests C to revoke the login credential utilized
to generate a signature σ ′
s on a message M′. C simulates
the Revoke algorithm and responds with the updated tRL′.

(2) Pi∗ (cid:60) cpl; and
(3) true ← Identify(gpk, σ∗, M∗, tski∗), where tski∗ is the TPM’s
secret key of the platform Pi∗.
LASER satisfies the non-frameability property if for any PPT ad-
versary, the probability on winning the non-frameability game is
negligibly small.
Among the above properties, the adaptable unlinkability is an
important notion to consider in evaluating LASER with respect to
other DAA schemes. In the existing DAA schemes, the platform
obtains a credential, and can generate signatures which are unlink-
able by both the verifier and the issuer, and hence have absolute
unlinkability. However, in LASER, we observe that the platform
obtains ms login credentials, and has the option to generate sig-
natures in two categories. In the first category, if a signature is
generated using a login credential which was not utilized earlier to
generate any other signature, neither the issuer and nor the verifier
is able to link this signature to any other signature generated by
the same platform. Hence, in LASER, the platform can generate
ms signatures which satisfy the absolute unlinkability property.
In the second category, if a signature is generated using a login
credential which was also utilized earlier, the issuer can link this
signature to all the signatures generated previously using the same
login credential. But even in this second category, the verifier is not
able to determine whether any two signatures are generated using
the same login credential. Hence, the platform can generate a large
number (which is not limited by the parameter ms) of signatures
which satisfy conditional unlinkability property. Note that in the
second category, if two signatures are generated using two different
login credentials, even the issuer is not able to determine whether
the two signatures are generated by the same platform.
Hence, in terms of security properties, there are two attributes
of LASER which distinguish it from all other DAA schemes. First,
LASER enables the platform to generate signatures which satisfy
conditional unlinkability property. This attribute makes LASER
usable in applications which desire a trade-off between the abso-
lute and no unlinkability properties. Second, LASER satisfies the
absolute unlinkability property in a limited sense, i.e., the num-
ber of absolutely unlinkable signatures is limited by the number
of the different login credentials. LASER exploits this attribute to
significantly reduce the large computational complexity and com-
munication overhead plaguing the existing DAA schemes.

(5) Challenge: A submits to C a message M and two platforms
Pi0 and Pi1 with the restriction that Pi0, Pi1 (cid:60) cpl. C selects
ϕ ←$ {0, 1}. Corresponding to Piϕ , C selects logCreiϕ jϕ using
the credential-selection rule conUnlink in the SelectLogCre
(cid:60) ccl. Further, C runs the
algorithm such that logCreiϕ jϕ
Sign protocol, and responds with the signature σs on M.
(6) Queries-Phase II (Restricted Queries): A probes C with the re-
stricted queries defined in the Queries-Phase II in the absolute
unlinkability game.
(7) Output: A outputs a bit ϕ′ indicating its guess of ϕ.
A wins the game if ϕ′ = ϕ, and the advantage of A is defined
as AdvconA = |Pr(ϕ′ = ϕ) − 1/2|. LASER with the rule conUnlink
satisfies the conditional unlinkability property if the advantage of
any PPT adversary on winning the conditional unlinkability game
is negligibly small.
Definition A.4. LASER satisfies the adaptable anonymity prop-
erty if LASER satisfies the absolute unlinkability property for the
signatures generated using the credential-selection rule absUnlink,
and the conditional unlinkability property for the signatures gener-
ated using the credential-selection rule conUnlink.
A.3 Traceability
The traceability property implies that no colluding set of platforms
can create a valid signature that can not be traced back to any
platform, as defined below.
Definition A.5. For an adversary A and a challenger C, the trace-
tRL∗.
ability game is defined as follows.
(1) The Setup, MemCreGen, LogCreGen and Queries phases in this
game are defined in the same manner as the Setup, MemCreGen,
LogCreGen and Queries phases in conditional unlinkability game,
respectively.
(2) Output: A outputs a message M∗ and a signature σ∗ for given
A wins the above traceability game if:
(1) valid ← Verify(gpk, σ∗, M∗, tRL∗);
(2) A did not obtain σ∗ by making a Sign query; and
(3) ∀i ∈ [1, mt], false ← Identify(gpk, σ∗, M∗, tski).
LASER satisfies the traceability property if for any PPT adversary,
the probability on winning the traceability game is negligibly small.
A.4 Non-frameability
The non-frameability property implies that no colluding set of
entities (including the issuer) can forge a valid signature that can
be traced back to a non-colluding platform, as defined below.
Definition A.6. For an adversary A and a challenger C, the non-
frameability game is defined as follows.
(1) The Setup, MemCreGen, LogCreGen and Queries phases in this
game are defined in the same manner as Setup, MemCreGen,
LogCreGen and Queries phases in the absolute unlinkability
game, respectively.
(2) Output: A outputs a message M∗ and a signature σ∗ correspond-
ing to a platform Pi∗.
A wins the above non-frameability game if:
