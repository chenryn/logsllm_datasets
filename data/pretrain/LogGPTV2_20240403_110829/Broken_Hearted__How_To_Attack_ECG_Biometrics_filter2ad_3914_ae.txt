index for empirical distributions and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistic (KS) [5]. Using L2, we get an overall SR of 49.9%,
while for χ2 and KS, the SR is 29.5% and 39.6%, respectively.
This supports our choice of L2.
Mapping strategies. We ﬁnally evaluate a number of alternatives
to the default mapping functions. Signals generated using the
default settings, where the mapping is estimated from the whole
training dataset and considers the full set of ECG features,
resulted in an SR of 26.2%. Slightly worse success rates are
obtained when some of the features are not transformed, i.e.,
left as detected in the source signal: the overall SR is 22.8%,
21.1% and 20% if excluding, respectively, widths, peak intervals
and both. As expected, the exclusion of amplitude features has
shown no signiﬁcant success. We get comparable results when
considering sub-optimal mappings in place of the best mapping
function found by the optimisation algorithm: for the second
and third best mappings, we have SRs of 21.5% and 21.9%,
respectively. We also learnt that one-2-one mappings estimated
from one single subject are mostly ineffective for attacking a
different subject (SR = 4.4%), thus conﬁrming the importance
of gathering a substantial training dataset. Another alternative

that performed poorly (SR = 11.5%) is building a mapping from
a single “super-individual”, obtained by merging the features
distributions across all subjects.
VI. RESULTS
We conduct the signal injection attack by combining the
building blocks described in the previous sections. After
enrolling a user into the Nymi Band, we ﬁrst inject the raw data
that was collected using each of the devices (see Section IV).
Following that, we apply the mapping function, which has been
trained on the initial set of users (i.e., not including the user
that is being attacked) to obtain the transformed signals. As
outlined in Section V, the mapping function employs random
sampling of features to generate the attack signal. We use
between 2 and 4 repetitions of this sampling process and report
whether at least one of them was accepted by the Nymi Band.
As the Nymi Band does not limit the number of authentication
attempts a user can make, the only cost of repetitions lies in an
increased time required to carry out the attack. Due to space
constraints we report only the results of injecting the ECG
signals by playing back .wav ﬁles using an off-the-shelf music
player. As we have discussed in Section III, the performance
that can be expected is similar for all three devices, and the
.wav playback poses the lowest technological barrier for the
attacker, both in terms of cost and compactness. The raw results
of our analysis are shown in Table II and III, a summary is
shown in Figure 14. For 3 out of 21 users we were unable to
collect high-quality signals using the external electrodes of the
ECG monitor, leaving us with 18 attack attempts for the Lead
I and Lead II data sources.
Not surprisingly, the success rate of injecting data collected
with the Nymi Band is the highest. With the exception of four
users, using this data resulted in unlocking the band, leading to a
12
attacker to obtain a different source of ECG information. In
the medical domain it is necessary to measure multiple ECG
leads as they contain different kinds of information, so it is
not implausible that this is similar for identifying (biometric)
information.
Overall, the attacker’s chance of success is 81% assuming
they have obtained a measurement through the Nymi Band,
and 62% if they have only obtained data from the remaining
sources. The latter is computed as the fraction of users for
which at least one of the four data sources led to a successful
activation of the band (shown as the ”Combined” column in
Table II and III)
VII. RELATED WORK
The increasing popularity of biometrics as an authentication
mechanism has sparked research into a variety of attacks.
Multiple approaches to imitate users or forge measurements
have been proposed, including attackers modifying their own
behavior and attacks being carried out automatically.
Sharif et al. demonstrate an attack on face recognition
systems that relies on the attacker wearing a pair of printed
eyeglass frames [21]. Their approach enables the attacker
to both impersonate a victim and to evade face detection.
The attack treats the classiﬁer as a whitebox (i.e., assumes
knowledge of the internals) and highlights the danger of using
machine learning in adversarial settings.
Tey et al. propose an attack on keystroke dynamics (distinc-
tive typing patterns), targeting systems using the biometric for
password hardening [25]. The attack assumes the password to
be known to the attacker, who then has to mimic the legitimate
user’s keystroke dynamics while typing it. The authors devise a
system that gives positive and negative feedback to the attacker
regarding their closeness to being accepted. This feedback
relates to individual features, such as character hold times and
interkey times (i.e., the time between pressing two individual
keys). Depending on the information given to the attackers,
a false accept rate of up to 99% is achieved, suggesting
that it is possible for humans to adapt their own typing
patterns enough to fool state-of-the-art systems. Nevertheless,
this approach assumes that both the password and the typing
patterns are known, which requires either use of a keylogging
device or a password database compromise. In addition, it is
doubtful whether this approach can be adapted to continuous
authentication systems that work on free texts, rather than short
passwords.
Touchscreen input biometrics have gained immense popu-
larity over the past few years due to the rise of smartphones,
tablets and other touchscreen devices. Zheng et al propose
an authentication system based on touchscreen input and also
measure the advantage gained by attackers through observing
the victim [27]. The results indicate that simple observation is
not enough to trick the system, although their work assumes
that the attackers have no speciﬁc knowledge of the system’s
features. As such, the failed impersonation could be due to
insufﬁcient information, or the fact that touchscreen inputs are
inherently difﬁcult for humans to mimic. Serwadda et al. take
a different approach by building a Lego robot to carry out the
attack, rather than having a human modify their behavior [20].
Instead of using biometric data from the targeted legitimate user,

mapping function.
success rate of 81%. However, two out of the four unsuccessful
users (3 and 6) failed to authenticate themselves following
enrolment. This hints that the failure of the attack is most
likely a consequence of erratic or noisy data being collected
during the enrolment phase. Injecting the Lead II measurement
succeeded only for a single user. Intuitively, this makes sense
since Lead II measures voltage between the left leg and right
arm (rather than the left and right arm, which is approximately
what the Nymi Band observes). Conversely, Lead I performs
relatively well in the attack, succeeding in ﬁve out of 21 users
(24%), most likely being a result of the similar measurement
points. Based on this intuition, one would expect the palm
measurements to perform similarly well, as the measurement
points (palm of the left hand and index ﬁnger of the right hand)
are even closer to those used by the Nymi Band (wrist of left
hand and index ﬁnger of right hand). However, using these
measurements caused the attack to fail for all users (and is the
only data source to do so).
Applying the mapping function considerably improves these
results, particularly for those data sources that performed poorly
initially. The success rate for using Lead I data improves from
28% to 50%. The Palm measurements, which were initially
unsuccessful for all users, could be used for successful attacks
on 5 users, thus increasing the success rate from 0% to 24%.
The mobile ECG monitor data source is the only one where
applying the mapping function causes the attack to fail for one
user. This is most readily explained by the unmodiﬁed data just
being on the edge of being accepted. The only data source for
which the mapping function had no effect (positive or negative)
is the Lead II data obtained from the ECG monitor. This could
be either due to limitations of the mapping function (such
as the precise feature set of the Nymi Band being unknown),
or due to important biometric information simply not being
present in this lead. The former case could possibly be remedied
by obtaining a better understanding of the biometric features
involved (which is difﬁcult in a blackbox scenario as presented
by the Nymi Band). In the latter case, it is not possible to ﬁnd
a mapping between the feature distributions, thus requiring the

Using a subset of all users, they train the robot to perform
swipes and scrolls in a way that is sufﬁciently common for a
high number of users. Carrying out the attack increases the
system’s Equal Error Rate (EER) by between 339% and 1004%.
At present, authentication systems based on touchscreen inputs
are not commercially available, causing the authors to create
their own. While they loosely base their features and system
design on the popular work by Frank et al. [7], the initial (i.e.,
before the attack) EER (13%) of the system is much higher
even after excluding users exhibiting poor error rates. Unlike
a regular single-target imitation attack, the proposed attack
targets multiple users at once and therefore requires an overlap
between users’ templates that would be unlikely to be found in
systems with lower error rates. As such it is doubtful whether
the described attack is as effective or applicable at all when
using state-of-the-art systems.
VIII. DISCUSSION AND COUNTERMEASURES
In the previous sections we have outlined an effective
presentation attack against ECG biometrics in general and
have shown its effectiveness when applied to the Nymi Band.
Most generally, there are two main approaches to mitigate the
attack:
The ﬁrst approach is liveness detection. Liveness detection
attempts to detect an injected signal and distinguish it from
a signal originating from a human. This technique has been
applied with varying degrees of effectiveness for other biomet-
rics. The case of ﬁngerprint readers in particular showcases
that this is most likely an arms race between system designers
considering more indications of liveness (e.g., the presence
of skin oils or moisture for ﬁngerprint readers) and attackers
spooﬁng these indicators.
The second approach would be to keep the biometric data
secret, thus attempting to prevent the attacker from obtaining
any of the victim’s ECG data. One could make the case that
the Nymi Band’s SDK should not allow for ECG data to
be recorded, either through NEAs or otherwise. Disabling
this functionality would make it at least signiﬁcantly harder
for the attacker to directly obtain data with the correct ECG
morphology. As creating the mapping function requires training
data from the target device, making this data hard to obtain
would also raise the bar to carry out the attack. However,
it might still be possible to determine the device-speciﬁc
effects on the signal by analysing the hardware, rather than
through empirical analysis of recorded signals. As we have
demonstrated, the mapping function allows the attacker to
obtain data from an arbitrary device and use it to attack
the authentication system. While the probability of success
somewhat depends on the device, we have demonstrated
successful attacks using all of the devices we analyzed. Due
to the large variety of devices recording ECG (e.g., medical
ECG monitors, ﬁtness devices, e-health) for purposes other
than authentication, we do not consider keeping the ECG data
secret a viable strategy.
In this work we have applied the mapping function in a way
that allows us to attack an ECG-based authentication system
with data collected on a different device. However, the same
approach can be used to improve the interoperability of a
biometric across different devices. For example, once a user
is successfully enrolled for one device (e.g., a smartphone for
the touchscreen input biometric), he could be authenticated on
any other device without the need for re-enrolment, provided
a mapping function between these devices has been trained
beforehand.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this work we have presented a novel presentation
attack against ECG biometrics and have demonstrated its
effectiveness in attacking the Nymi Band. The Nymi Band
is a commercially available wristband that is currently being
trialled by MasterCard to authenticate the wearer for contactless
payments. After collecting ECG data from 41 volunteers on
different devices, we observed that the distributions of biometric
features vary between these devices as well as different ECG
measurement positions (Leads). This presents an attacker with
difﬁculties when performing a presentation attack with data
gathered on a different device. To address this challenge we
describe a so-called mapping function, which transforms ECG
signals measured on any device to change its morphology to
match that of the Nymi Band. We use half of the subjects in
our dataset to train the mapping function while the remainder
is set aside to evaluate the actual attack. We use a number of
signal injection methods, including a hardware signal generator
and the playback of an ECG signal encoded as a .wav ﬁle.
As such, the technological barriers to carry out the attack are
extremely low in terms of both cost and hardware requirements.
Our results show that injecting ECG data collected with the
Nymi Band shows the highest success rate (81%). When using
only the remaining signal sources we achieve a success rate
of 43%, which increases to 62% after applying the mapping
function.
Our results conﬁrm the seriousness of the attack. Due to the
universality of the mapping function and our signal injection
devices, we expect the attack to show similar performance
against other ECG-based authentication systems. We intend to
further explore this once more systems become commercially
available.
