### Introduction to Data Recovery

Data recovery becomes necessary when the source material fails and there is no viable backup, either physical or logical. There are two primary types of data recovery:

1. **Physical Data Recovery:** This involves retrieving data from damaged media, which often requires repairing the media.
2. **Logical Data Recovery:** This is required when files have been accidentally or intentionally deleted. In such cases, the media is usually undamaged, and standard software can be used for recovery.

Most data recovery software is designed to handle logical recovery but lacks the capability to deal with physically damaged media. This is because these tools rely on the operating system's functions for input and error correction, which are not effective when the media is damaged.

### Four Phases of Data Recovery

1. **Repair the Hard Drive:**
   - Restore the hard drive to a functional state, often requiring specialized hardware or equipment.
   
2. **Image, Copy, or Recover the Physical Drive:**
   - Use bitstream imaging to copy the drive and its sectors. If the drive is operational, software like `dd_rescue` (with `dd_rhelp` script) on a Linux system can be used. Hardware solutions, such as the DeepSpar Disk Imager, are also effective.
   
3. **Perform Logical Recovery:**
   - Use software to recover files, partition structures, and other necessary items. This is the most common type of data recovery application.
   
4. **Repair Files in Damaged Sectors:**
   - Recover files that may exist in damaged areas. This is crucial in forensic work for reassembling data, even if it is incomplete. It is also applicable for recovering corrupted Word and Excel documents.

### Understanding Hard Drives and File Systems

The hard drive itself is unaware of file content; this is managed by the Operating System (OS). When the OS requests a file, it asks for a logical block, which the drive translates into a physical location using Cylinder-Head-Sector (CHS) coordinates. The drive has spare sectors and tracks to manage errors and data relocation. For example, in an NTFS file system, the `$BadClus` attribute indicates what the OS considers to be bad sectors.

### New Developments in Data Recovery

#### Flash Memory Recovery

I am currently working on recovering data from USB flash memory sticks. By removing and reattaching the chips to a new flash drive, I can often recover the data. Solid-state storage is becoming increasingly prevalent due to its reliability and low power consumption. SanDisk, for instance, offers a 32 GB solid-state drive for laptops, and 16 GB memory sticks are now available for less than $200.

A major challenge with flash memory is its limited write-erase cycles. Each block can only be erased a certain number of times (typically around 1 million cycles) before it fails. To mitigate this, wear leveling algorithms distribute writes across different sectors, extending the lifespan of the memory stick to potentially over 50 years.

To repair a memory stick, you need to find a matching board, unsolder the undamaged chips, and mount them onto a new board. This process is still under development, and I will provide updates as I learn more. If you work at SanDisk and can provide insights into TrueFFS, please contact me.

#### TrueFFS Notes

TrueFFS, developed by M-Systems, is a flash file system management technology that allows flash components to emulate hard disk interfaces. Key features include:

- **Third-generation wear leveling:** Ensures all blocks are erased equally, significantly increasing the product's lifespan.
- **Virtual blocking:** Makes large erase blocks transparent to the user.
- **Automatic bad block mapping:** Manages and maps out bad blocks.

### Hard Drive Inner Workings and Common Issues

In my previous speech at Defcon 14, I covered the basic inner workings of a hard drive and various repair methods. You can find that speech on DVD, online, or at [www.myharddrivedied.com](http://www.myharddrivedied.com).

One of the most common questions I receive is about the clicking noise in hard drives. This issue is complex and can be caused by several factors. My goal today is to provide deeper insight into the hard drive's internal operations and potential fixes for the clicking noise.

### Boot Sequence and Power-On Functions

When a hard drive powers on, it follows these steps:

1. **Power-on Chip Status Check:**
   - The drive checks the status of its chips to ensure the electronics are functioning.
   
2. **Self-Check:**
   - The drive performs a self-check of its components and waits for a return status.
   
3. **Spindle Spin-Up:**
   - The spindle starts spinning, creating an air bearing that lifts the heads off the platters.
   
4. **Un-mounting Heads:**
   - The heads are un-mounted from the rack once sufficient airflow is generated.
   
5. **Servo Timing Reads:**
   - The heads read servo timing information from the platters, which provides geographic data for data placement.
   
6. **System Area (SA) Reading:**
   - The heads move to the SA to read essential information and firmware.

### Servo Data and System Area Information

**Servo Sections:**
- These are arc-shaped sections that store location and geographic information for each sector. A split sector is one interrupted by servo info.

**System Area (SA):**
- The SA contains critical information such as SMART data, system logs, serial numbers, model numbers, defect lists, firmware, and security data. This information is usually stored on the outer tracks of the platters and can be copied from multiple locations to restore the drive.

### Conclusion

Understanding the four phases of data recovery and the inner workings of hard drives and flash memory is essential for effective data recovery. As technology advances, new challenges and solutions will continue to emerge. Stay tuned for further updates and developments in this field.
