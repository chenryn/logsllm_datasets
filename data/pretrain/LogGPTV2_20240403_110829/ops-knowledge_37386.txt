User: I went to tools, plugins. Then chose to install the three python items that show up. After installation. I choose the restart netbeans option. But instead of restarting, netbeans just closed. And now it is not opening. Any ideas how to fix this? I normally develop Java on my netbeans 7 install.
I am using a mac osx
I see there are no takers, so let me ask this: Is there a way to revert to before the new plugin install?
Assistant: I had the same issue. Netbeans would die before opening at all. I could not fix it, and had to revert back to 6.9.1.
