I recently installed Atom 1.0.0 and have noticed that it is running very slowly. When I type, there is a noticeable lag every 5-10 characters, lasting up to 2-3 seconds. The file I am working with contains approximately 3,500 lines and is 180 KB in size. I have attempted to resolve the issue by using safe mode and disabling spell check, but the editor remains unacceptably slow. Additionally, CPU usage spikes to 80-100% on one core as soon as I start typing.

When I press the "Enter" key, the editor lags for about 3 seconds, and CPU usage again peaks at around 80% on one core. However, when I open a new file with only a few lines, the editor performs without any lag.

Here are my system specifications:
- **Operating System:** Linux 3.13.0-40-generic #69-Ubuntu x86_64
- **Processor:** Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU M 520 @ 2.40GHz
- **RAM:** 6 GB
- **Storage:** SSD

I really like this editor and would be willing to help diagnose the problem if someone could guide me on what steps to take.

Thank you.
