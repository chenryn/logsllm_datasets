I have just installed Atom 1.0.0 and it runs very slow. When I type it seems
to lag every 5-10 characters for up to 2-3 seconds. The file I opened has
around 3500 lines and 180 kB. I have tried using safe mode and disabling
spellcheck, but it is still too slow. CPU usage peaks to 80-100% on one core
as soon as I start typing.  
When I press enter, editor lags for 3 seconds and CPU usage spikes to maybe
80% on one core.
When I open new file with only several lines, it works without the lag.
System info: Linux 3.13.0-40-generic #69-Ubuntu x86_64, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5
CPU M 520 @ 2.40GHz, 6 GB RAM, SSD.
I like this editor and I would like to help to diagnose this problem if
someone tells me what to do.
Thank You.
