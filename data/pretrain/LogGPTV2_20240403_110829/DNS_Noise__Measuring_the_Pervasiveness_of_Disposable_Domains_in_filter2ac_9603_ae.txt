### Observations on Disposable Domains

Over a 13-day period, more than 80% of new domains observed daily were disposable, as new disposable domains are continually generated. The number of unique disposable resource records (RRs) increased from 8,111,274 on February 1, 2011, to 29,738,493 on December 30, 2011, with a peak of 33,704,127 on November 14, 2011. The percentage of daily unique disposable RRs also rose from 38.3% to 65.5% (see Figure 13).

Disposable domains are increasingly present in the DNS long tail. Table I shows the distribution of the long tail from the RR lookup volume. The second column represents the size of the tail for all RRs, the third column shows the disposable part of the tail, and the last column presents the fraction of disposable RRs in the tail. On February 1, 2011, disposable RRs represented 28% of the tail, increasing to 57% by December 30, 2011. Notably, between 96% to 98% of all disposable RRs are found in the tail.

Table II provides the statistics of the long tail in the domain hit rate distribution of resource records. Approximately 96% of disposable RRs belong to the tail, and the percentage of domains in the long tail that are also disposable RRs increased from 28% to 57% during 2011. In summary, disposable RRs are predominantly found in the DNS long tail, and this trend is intensifying.

### Discussion

#### Section V-C Summary
In Section V-C, we demonstrated that disposable domains account for about 25% of all unique queried domains and 27% to 37% of all successfully resolved domains daily. Additionally, distinct RRs related to disposable domains represent an average of 60% of all distinct RRs observed in a single day. We also provided evidence that large content providers, such as Facebook and Google, use disposable domains. This section discusses the potential negative effects of the continued growth in the use of disposable domains and their impact on modern DNS operations and related systems. Our goal is to identify and highlight these possible effects to help the operational community anticipate and plan for necessary changes in DNS operations.

#### A. DNS Caching
In Section IV-B, we showed that disposable RRs have very low or zero cache hit rates, which is a natural consequence of their "one-time use" nature. As the use of disposable domains increases, DNS caches may be filled with entries that are unlikely to be reused. Assuming a typical Least Recently Used (LRU) cache implementation with a fixed memory allocation, during periods of heavy load, queries to disposable domains may cause useful cached non-disposable domains to be prematurely evicted to make room for them. This can increase the traffic between DNS resolvers and authoritative name servers, leading to higher response latency. If this occurs frequently, caching policies may need adjustments, such as treating disposable domains with lower priority.

Forcing disposable domains to use a time-to-live (TTL) value of zero is not feasible. First, it is impractical to force all domain owners to set the TTL of disposable domains to zero, as they can freely choose the TTL value. Figure 14 shows the TTL distribution for disposable domains on February 1, 2011, and December 30, 2011. Only 0.8% of disposable domains had a TTL of zero, and 28% had a TTL of 1 second on February 1, 2011. Over time, domain owners switched to using larger TTL values. For example, in December, most disposable domains had a TTL of 300 seconds. Additionally, some recursive DNS software implementations hold resource records in the cache for a minimum number of seconds, even when their TTL is set to zero [25], [26].

#### B. DNSSEC-Enabled Resolvers
With the widespread deployment of DNSSEC, every domain name under a zone will need to be signed. This will place more pressure on validating resolvers, consuming more resources. Validating signed responses will require higher CPU usage and increased memory due to the larger resource records introduced by DNSSEC specifications (e.g., DNSKEY, DS, RRSIG [27], [28], [29]). Disposable domains will significantly increase this pressure, as each queried disposable domain may require an additional signature validation whose result will never be reused. The cache must store not only the disposable RRs but also their signatures. This problem may be mitigated if authoritative servers responsible for disposable zones register disposable domains under a single signed wildcard domain, from which the disposable domains are synthesized.

#### C. Passive DNS Databases
Passive DNS database systems (pDNS-DBs) have become essential tools for analyzing security incidents and assisting DNS operations [14], [13], [30]. For example, pDNS-DBs have been extensively used to investigate Operation Aurora [9], attacks on EMC/RSA [10], and malware infections like Stuxnet [11] and Flame [12]. These databases play a crucial role in archiving long-term historic DNS information and are indispensable for constructing dynamic reputation systems [6], [7], [8].

Disposable domains increase the storage requirements and potentially the query-response latency of pDNS-DBs. After bootstrapping a pDNS-DB with over 13 days of resolution traffic (see Figure 15), 88% of all unique resource records in the database were disposable, requiring storage to maintain a full account of historic DNS resolutions. The percentage of new RRs related to disposable domains increased from 68% to 94% daily. This problem can be mitigated by filtering disposable domains and storing a single wildcard domain in the pDNS-DB. For instance, a domain like 1022vr5.dns.xx.fbcdn.net can be replaced by *.dns.xx.fbcdn.net. Using wildcards would reduce the 129,674,213 distinct disposable resource records to 945,065 (0.7%) resource records.

### Conclusion
This paper describes and builds a disposable zone miner to automatically find disposable domain names. Using traffic from a large ISP in North America, we identified and measured a new category of DNS traffic, the disposable domain, which currently is "lost" in the DNS noise. We show that, on average, disposable domain names are responsible for a significant portion of all domain names observed (25%) and resolved (32%), 60% of unique resource records observed daily, and 88% of all unique resource records observed during our 13-day experiments. Furthermore, we discussed their potential implications for DNS caches, DNSSEC deployment, and passive DNS data collection systems.
