APPENDIX
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION OF DATA FIELDS
In the following we report a detailed list of the collected data fields.
CVE. The Common Vulnerability and Exposures ID assigned by
the MITRE corporation to disclosed software vulnerabilities.
CVEPub. The date of vulnerability publication on NVD.
ExplVen. The anonymized market identifier of the user who
posts the advert on the market.
ExplVenReg. The date of vendor registration on the forum.
Pack. The exploit package advertised by the seller on the market.
Packages bundle one or more vulnerability exploits.
PubDate. The date of package publication in RuMarket.
PackType. The type of exploit package. The categorization emerges
from the ExplVen package description.
PackPrice. The upfront price that the customer has to pay to
acquire or rent the package. For rental packages we compute the
mean rental price for a rental period of 3 weeks, in line with previous
work on the duration of malware delivery campaigns and user
infections [41]. All prices in RuMarket are reported in USD.
PackActivity. The RuMarket activity around an exploit pack-
age expressed as the number of replies received by the product
advert on the market.
PackDeath. The date when RuMarket activity around the pack-
age stops.
ExplPrice. Estimation of cost of a single exploit. When only
one exploit is bundled in a package, this corresponds to the package
price, otherwise we provide an estimation. Further considerations
are given in Sec. 3.4.
SwVen. The vendor of the vulnerable software affected by the
published exploit.
Sw. The vulnerable software or platform.
CVSS. The severity of the exploited vulnerability as expressed by
the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, the standard framework
for evaluation of software vulnerability characteristics [31].
SYM. Presence or absence of an exploit in the wild at scale.
SYM REGRESSION
Table 10 below reports standard OLS coefficients using the average
value of the fixed effects for each CVE as regressors. Results are
equivalent to those shown by the mixed model in Table 9.

Table 12: CWE counts by package
CWEs are uniformly distributed among packages, i.e. each pack
contains vulnerabilities of the same or comparable type. This
indicates that within a single package, exploit development cost
are comparable and significantly skewed distributions of costs
are unlikely.
