    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. Copy the following into a file:
    package main
    import "fmt"
    func main() {
            wait := make(chan bool)
            go func() {
                     status 0x137f", followed
    by the program's output, followed by the program hanging. No output from 6prof.
    What is your $GOOS?  $GOARCH?
    GOOS=linux
    GOARCH=amd64

    It seems to work sometimes with even an empty goroutine, but removing the channel seems
    to make things inconsistent.
