User: How to use Python script to start and stop the application running?
Assistant: To start and stop an application run using a Python script, the `subprocess` module can be used. Start the application: ```python import subprocess # Start the application subprocess.Popen("path/to/application.exe") ``` Stop the application: ```python import subprocess # Get the application process ID process = subprocess .Popen("tasklist", stdout=subprocess.PIPE) output, error = process.communicate() for line in output.splitlines(): if "application.exe" in line: pid = int(line.split()[ 1]) break # terminate the application subprocess.Popen("taskkill /F /PID %d" % pid) ``` It should be noted that `path/to/application.exe` and `application.exe` in the above code ` needs to be replaced with the path and name of the actual application. Also, `application.exe` in the code that terminates the application also needs to be replaced with the name of the actual application.
