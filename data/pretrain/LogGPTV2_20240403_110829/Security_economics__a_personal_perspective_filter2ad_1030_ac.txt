papers in each WEIS, and some more in SOUPS (Lorrie
Cranor’s Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security) both
of these had plenty papers on their core topics. We also felt
that to fully develop the potential of the ﬁeld we needed to
tackle not just the privacy conundrum and the problems of
password usability, but much broader and deeper issues such
as the nature of deception both online and oﬄine, and the
mechanisms underlying our overreaction to terrorism. Dave
Clark at MIT volunteered the premises and the ﬁrst SHB
took place in June 2008. SHB attracts mainly security engi-
neers and psychologists, but with a decent sprinkling of an-
thropologists, philosophers and even a couple of magicians.
It has also gone from strength to strength, though unlike
WEIS (which now has over 100 attendees) it is restricted to
about 60 invited participants to keep it interactive.
6. HORIZONS
In addition to the threads on the econometrics and be-
havioural economics of security that I’ve expanded on above,
there are many more things going on. At recent WEIS
events, many papers have built on the established themes of
patch management, vulnerability markets and other infor-
mation sharing mechanisms, investment models, regulation,
open versus closed systems, rights management and insur-
ance. But ever more new topics have opened up. Cormac
Herley and colleagues at Microsoft have written a series of
microeconomics papers on the incentives facing players in
the underground economy [17, 18, 22, 23, 24]. Ben Edelman
wrote a beautiful paper about adverse selction in certiﬁca-
tion, in which he showed that privacy-certiﬁed websites were
more likely to invade your privacy than others and that the
top search ad was more than twice as likely to be malicious
as the top free search result [15]. My students Shishir Na-
garaja and Hyoungshick Kim had fun playing evolutionary
games on networks between agents and the authorites, gain-
ing interesting insights about optimal strategies for both law
enforcement and insurgents [25, 27].
By WEIS 2009, privacy failures in social networks had
become a hot topic [13]. In 2010, we were titillated to learn
that most of the pay-per-install industry was now carried
on the back of pornography, or perhaps on other parts of
its anatomy [41], while we also had a serious paper from
the Federal Reserve about card fraud [36]. 2011 brought
us a keynote talk on neuroeconomics at the scientiﬁc end,
while at the practical end we had a depressing survey of the
certiﬁcation malpractices of the million top websites: only
5.7% do things properly [40]. And ﬁnally, at WEIS 2012
we learned that US cities with competing hospital groups as
opposed to monopolies have signiﬁcantly poorer information
security practices [20], while one of the ﬁrst papers on the
macro aspects showed that participation in e-crime across
countries varied with English proﬁciency, labour market size
and the level of corruption of the local government, but not
with per-capita GDP [19].
In retrospect, the growth of security economics has come
in three directions. First, there has been a broadening of
its scope, so we can now ﬁnd papers on ‘security and X’
for many subdisciplines X of economics as well as psychol-
ogy and a number of neighbouring humanities subjects. The
second has been a deepening of those mines found to be prof-
itable, such as the behavioural aspects and the econometrics
of wickedness. Where you ﬁnd gold, you keep digging! The
third has been ‘security economics of Y’ for a number of
application areas Y, ranging from payment cards through
electricity meters to online pornography. There is still quite
some room for work in each of these three directions.
7. CONCLUSIONS
The study of security economics began seriously in 2000.
It was given a huge boost by two factors. The ﬁrst was 9/11
and the subsequent rapid growth of the security-industrial
complex, of which security economists have been among the
most consistent critics. The second was the increasing adap-
tation of technical security mechanisms to support restric-
tive business models, from the Trusted Computing initiative
through various kinds of DRM. Security economics has shed
light on many other interesting topics, from cooperation and
conﬂict in networks, through the drivers for security tech-
nology adoption, to the limitations of insurance markets.
In this article I’ve presented only a small snapshot; the in-
terested reader should look at our survey paper [9], and then
at our security economics web page [12] for more. For an
even bigger picture see The Oxford Handbook of the Digital
Economy, which contains surveys not just on the economics
of security and privacy, but also of many related ﬁelds such
as teh regulation of the Internet, software platforms, card
payments, auctions, reputation systems, price comparison,
social networks and copyright infringement [30].
Over the last ﬁfteen years or so, the world economy has
been disrupted – and white-collar crime has been revolu-
tionised – by the Internet. We’re not ﬁnished yet by any
means; as computers and communications become embed-
ded invisible everywhere, ever more devices and services will
start to have an online component. Ever more industries
will become a bit like the software industry. As always, the
utopians will be wrong: crimes and conﬂicts will not cease,
but will increasingly have some online aspect too. The con-
cepts and tools of security economics will in time become
one of the many frameworks we all use to understand the
world and our place in it.
