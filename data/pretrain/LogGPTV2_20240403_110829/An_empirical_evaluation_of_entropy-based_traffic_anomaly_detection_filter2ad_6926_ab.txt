and addresses.5 The strong correlations we observe are not
unique to one dataset. Further, the correlations on the CMU
dataset are stable across the 2005 and 2008 datasets. For
the remainder of the paper, we focus on results using the
CMU 2005 dataset.
3.2 Correlations in Anomaly Deviation Scores
Next, we explore if the correlations in the entropy time-
series values also extend to anomalies. We compute the
anomaly deviation score of each epoch as the magnitude of
normalized local variance computed over a sliding window
of size six representing a half-hour interval [3].
5Internet2, GEANT, and Georgia Tech only provide uni-
directional Netﬂow [14] style ﬂow records. Thus, we cannot
repeat the degree analysis on these.

Table 3: Correlations of wavelet deviation scores.
Table 3 shows that the port and address distributions are
as strongly correlated in deviation scores as they are in terms
of the entropy values. Interestingly, the behavioral features
become slightly more correlated to the other metrics. For
example, the correlation between out-degree and FSD in-
creases by 0.414 from their correlation in entropy to their
correlation in deviation scores. We hypothesize the reason
for this increase is that the in and out-degree distributions
show more stochastic variations than the other distributions.
Thus, they tend to be uncorrelated in terms of the timeseries
values. However, the wavelet analysis removes the noisy
variations and the deviation scores become more correlated.
3.3 Understanding the correlation in port and
address distributions
First, we rule out that the correlations arise as an ar-
tifact of factors such as entropy normalization, packet vs.
byte counts, and time scale of computing correlation values
(hour vs. day. vs. week). Once we eliminate these factors,
we posit that the correlations are due to (a) a fundamen-
tal property of the underlying traﬃc patterns and/or (b)
the unidirectional ﬂow accounting model. For (b), note that
this is not speciﬁc to our analysis and data. Uni-directional

ﬂow measurements are often the only type of measurements
available to network operators today.
To decouple (a) and (b), we consider the CMU-2005 dataset
since it has additional bi-directional annotations allowing us
to eliminate eﬀects from the uni-directional model. Under
a bidirectional ﬂow model, we ﬁnd that the source (desti-
nation) port and source (destination) address distributions
are structurally similar due to inherent properties of end-
host behavior. However, the correlations between the source
and destination entities arise due to the uni-directional na-
ture of the ﬂow measurements – each packet contributes to
both source and destination pairs. This causes the uni-
directional distributions to be approximately the union of
their bi-directional pairs.
3.4 Understanding Anomalies In Depth
Why do the anomalies detected by the port and address
distributions overlap and why do FSD and degree distri-
butions provide unique detection capabilities? To answer
this, we use a heuristic approach to identify eighteen ma-
jor events, indicated by alphabetical labels in Figure 1, and
summarized in Table 4. (Anomalies spanning multiple epochs
are clustered into a single event.) In the absence of ground
truth for our data, we develop a semi-automated anomaly
labeling approach that explains the observed anomalies.
The labeling technique consists of the following steps. First,
we analyze the top-k contributors within each distribution
(e.g., top 50 destination address receiving the most num-
ber packets) and check if the top-k set changes during the
anomaly. The rationale behind this approach is that the
top few contributors to the distributions are relatively sta-
ble during normal operation but may change signiﬁcantly
during the anomalies (e.g., if a new host/port entry enters
the top-k). Next, we identify the ﬂows corresponding to
these new entries in the top-k set. Finally, we remove these
ﬂows and recompute the entropy and wavelet scores over
the remaining ﬂows. If the anomaly subsides (i.e., the new
anomaly score computed over the residual data is lower than
the anomaly threshold), we attribute the anomaly event to
these new top-k entries.
Events J, Q, and R are measurement anomalies, charac-
terized by few or no ﬂow records in our dataset which show
no consistent behavior across the diﬀerent traﬃc features.
In alpha ﬂows (events F − H and L − N ), a few ports and
addresses (both source and destination) dominate the total
traﬃc volume [10], decreasing entropy. The events contain
a large volume of UDP traﬃc destined to a single external
host on popular application ports (80,53), which seem to be
triggered after a small amount of TCP traﬃc is transferred
on port 6667 (IRC botnet control). The alpha ﬂows are de-
tected by all the port and address distributions. Further, al-
pha ﬂows are the only type of anomaly detected by the port
and address distributions. This suggests that in our trace,
using all four port and address distributions provides no ad-
ditional detection capabilities compared with using only one
of the port or address distributions.
The series of anomalies collectively labeled O are caused
by an internal host being recruited as a P2P “supernode”
in the Kazaa network [8]. During the event, many hosts
connect to this supernode creating a signiﬁcant number of
small ﬂows causing a sharp decrease in the entropy of the
FSD. In event A, a single internal host scanned more than
350,000 unique external hosts, using a ﬁxed source port of
666. As there are a large number of small ﬂows, FSD detects
the scan. Event D is an outbound scan with a single internal
host scanning numerous external hosts on multiple ports.
In anomalies C, E, and I,
Only FSD detects the scan.
a large number of spoofed “hosts” send attack traﬃc to a
single destination on port 6667. The set of source addresses
in these ﬂows spans the entire /16 of the university address
space using a small range of port numbers. This leads us to
believe that an internal host may be sending attack traﬃc
with spoofed source addresses (within the same subnet) to
avoid egress ﬁltering.6
Events O and H are particularly interesting with respect
to the anomaly labeling heuristic. When removing the ini-
tial alpha ﬂow event (N ), we found that the anomaly O per-
sisted, which ports and addresses alone cannot detect. Event
H consisted of two independent alpha ﬂows from which our
initial analysis revealed one, and after discovering that an
anomaly persisted we discovered the second event. Contrary
to conventional wisdom, port and address distributions do
not show signiﬁcant deviations for the scanning anomalies
in our data. However, FSD detects such abnormal scanning
activity.
4. USING SYNTHETIC ANOMALIES
We use synthetically generated anomaly events to comple-
ment our measurement results. Table 5 presents a taxonomy
of the ﬁve synthetic anomalies we evaluate. For each type
of anomaly, we want to identify the traﬃc distribution(s)
that provide the most eﬀective detection capability. To un-
derstand the detection sensitivity, we vary the scale of the
anomaly using an anomaly-speciﬁc control parameter (e.g.,
number of sources involved in a DDoS or scan attack). We
insert the anomaly at 50 random locations in the month-
long trace, and report the average to ensure that the results
are not biased by time-of-day and day-of-week eﬀects.
In
the case of the DDoS and bandwidth ﬂoods, we are also
interested in comparing entropy-based detection to simple
volume based detection.
Inbound DDoS Flood: Each DDoS event is charac-
terized by a single destination address receiving a large vol-
ume of single-packet ﬂows (to overwhelm the bandwidth and
processing capacity of the server and routers). Figure 2(a)
shows the anomaly scores as a function of the percentage
of total DDoS traﬃc. Each attack source generates 10 kilo-
bits per second of attack traﬃc, using a ﬁxed packet size
of 57 bytes and a single ﬂow per packet. The attack ﬂows
are destined to port 80 on a randomly chosen host inside
the university. We have repeated the experiments varying
the destination port and the choice of destination address
(picking a high-volume, random, and low-volume host) and
found similar results.
The change in the FSD can easily detect the anomaly even
at a low magnitude since a single ﬂow is used per packet.
The destination port and destination address distributions
6Since we only have anonymized ﬂow level traces, we could
not further validate this hypothesis.
