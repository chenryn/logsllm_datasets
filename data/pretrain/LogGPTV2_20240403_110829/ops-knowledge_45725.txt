User: What is Kubernetes? How does it manage containerized applications?
Assistant: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration and management platform that enables users to easily manage containerized applications. It provides a simple and powerful way to deploy, scale and manage containerized applications. Kubernetes uses a distributed system of containerized applications to manage and schedule resources for each container. In this way, Kubernetes can ensure that each container is running on the appropriate resources and can work together with other containers to provide high availability, elasticity and scalability. Kubernetes also provides some other useful features, such as automatic container deployment and management, dynamic load balancing, fault self-healing, and adaptive container scheduling. These features make Kubernetes a very useful tool for managing containerized applications, especially in environments that require high availability, elasticity, and scalability.
