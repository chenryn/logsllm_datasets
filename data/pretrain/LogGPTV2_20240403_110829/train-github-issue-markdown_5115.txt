I've followed the custom-express-example to set custom server routes.
Next/Link is working properly in client-side, but when the page is refreshed,
the error message with 'not found' appears in console, regarding the files
(css/images) from '/static' folder.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The files in static folder should be found when matches the custom routes on
server.
## Current Behavior
client:
server:
    server.get('/lead/:id', async (req, res) => {
      return app.render(req, res, '/lead', { id: req.params.id });
    });
error when page is refreshed:

## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Define a custom route with express
## Context
I'm trying to set routes on an Express server and pass parameters by URL.
Style and image files in the static folder are not found when accessed
directly by the URL or refreshing the page.
