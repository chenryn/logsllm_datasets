### Issue Description

I have followed the `custom-express-example` to set up custom server routes. The `Next/Link` component works correctly on the client side, but when the page is refreshed, an error message with "not found" appears in the console, specifically regarding the files (CSS and images) from the `/static` folder.

**Note:** I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior

Files in the `static` folder should be accessible and correctly served when the custom routes are matched on the server.

### Current Behavior

- **Client Side:**
  - The `Next/Link` component works as expected.
- **Server Side:**
  - Custom route defined in Express:
    ```javascript
    server.get('/lead/:id', async (req, res) => {
      return app.render(req, res, '/lead', { id: req.params.id });
    });
    ```
- **Error When Page is Refreshed:**
  - The following error messages appear in the console:
    - ![Image 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10598662/37627192-10b917ca-2bb2-11e8-916f-c18900358873.png)

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Define a custom route using Express.

### Context

I am trying to set up routes on an Express server and pass parameters via the URL. However, style and image files in the `static` folder are not found when accessed directly by the URL or when the page is refreshed.
