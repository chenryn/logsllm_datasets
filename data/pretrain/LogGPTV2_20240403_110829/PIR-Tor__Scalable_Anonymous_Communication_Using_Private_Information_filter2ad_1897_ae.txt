kinds of proﬁling [18].
In this scenario, since there is
a separate circuit per application, the timeout period for
each circuit can be increased from the current value of
10 minutes, to keep the impact of additional circuits on
our architecture minimal (since the timeout period is set
to 10 minutes in order to prevent those same proﬁling
attacks).
For example,
Incorporating future path constraints. There have
been several proposals that incorporate more constraints
in the Tor path selection protocol.
it
has been suggested that relays must be chosen to min-
imize the chance of an end-to-end timing analysis at-
tack [11, 27]. Also, Sherr et al. [40] proposed to enable
applications to choose relays based on different perfor-
mance constraints like node-based selection, link-based
selection, and end-to-end path-based selection. We note
that PIR-Tor is able to incorporate these ideas to the ex-
tent that each block fetched from the database contains
multiple descriptors, and clients could apply similar al-
gorithms to select the descriptor that best ﬁts their con-
straints.
Preserving option to download global view. We note
that many use cases may require a global view of the
system. For example, it may be helpful to researchers or
developers working on improving the security and per-
formance of the Tor network to have a global view of
the system. Thus we propose that directory servers also
support an option to download the full database.
Limitations. The Tor network is comprised of volun-
teer nodes that contribute their bandwidth for anony-
mous communication. Our proposal essentially trades
off bandwidth for computation at the directory servers,
and thus directory servers are required to volunteer some
extra computational resources. We show in our perfor-
mance evaluation that only a small fraction of CPU re-
sources need to be volunteered by the designated direc-
tory servers, especially in the case of ITPIR-Tor. We be-
lieve that PIR-Tor offers a good tradeoff between band-
width and computational resources, and results in an
overall reduction in resource consumption at volunteer
nodes. Secondly, our design is not as scalable as alter-
nate peer-to-peer approaches, which can scale to tens of
million relays. However, our design provides improved
security properties over prior work. In particular, reason-
able parameters of PIR-Tor provide equivalent security
to that of the Tor network. The security of our archi-
tecture mostly depends on the security of PIR schemes
which are well understood and relatively easy to analyze,
as opposed to peer-to-peer designs that require analyzing
extremely complex and dynamic systems. The only ex-
ception to this is the scenario of CPIR-Tor with descrip-
tor re-use, where the security analysis is more complex.
Moreover, for all scaling scenarios, the communication
overhead in our architecture is at least an order of mag-
nitude smaller than that of Tor. Finally, PIR-Tor assumes
the use of a small set of standard exit policies for nodes
to select from, though a few outliers can be tolerated by
downloading their information in their entirety.
10 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented PIR-Tor, an architecture for
the Tor network where clients do not need to maintain a
global view of the system, and instead leverage private
information retrieval techniques to protect their privacy
from compromised directory servers. In our evaluation,
we ﬁnd that PIR-Tor reduces the communication over-
head of the Tor network by at least an order of magni-
tude. We analyzed two ﬂavors of our architecture, based
on computational PIR and information-theoretic PIR re-
spectively. In computational PIR, clients fetch only a few
blocks from the PIR database, and reuse blocks to build
additional circuits. While this modiﬁcation has no im-
pact on client anonymity, it slightly weakens the unlink-
ability of circuits. On the other hand, in information-
theoretic PIR, clients perform a PIR query per circuit
creation and do not reuse blocks, resulting in a level of
security that is equivalent to the Tor network. While
information-theoretic PIR requires all guard relays to be
directory servers, computational PIR is more easily inte-
grated into the current Tor network.
