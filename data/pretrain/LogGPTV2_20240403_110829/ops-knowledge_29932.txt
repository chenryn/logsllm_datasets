User: I've written a curses program in python. It runs fine. However, when I use nodelay(), the program exits straight away after starting in the terminal, with nothing shown at all (just a new prompt).
EDIT
This code will reproduce the bug: 

sc = curses.initscr()

sc.nodelay(1) # But removing this line allows the program to run properly

for angry in range(20):
        sc.addstr(angry, 1, "hi")


Here's my full code

import curses, time, sys, random

def paint(x, y, i):
        #...
def string(s, y):
        #...

def feed():
        #...

sc = curses.initscr()
curses.start_color()
curses.curs_set(0)
sc.nodelay(1) #########################################

 # vars + colors inited

for angry in range(20):
        try:
                dir = chr(sc.getch())

                sc.clear()

                feed()

                #lots of ifs

                body.append([x, y])
                body.pop(0)

                for point in body:
                        paint(*point, i=2)

                sc.move(height-1, 1)
                sc.refresh()
                time.sleep(wait)

        except Exception as e:
                print sys.exc_info()[0], e

sc.getch()
curses.beep()

curses.endwin()

Why is this happenning, and how can I use nodelay() safely?
Assistant: I see no difference when running your small test program with or without the sc.nodelay() line. 
Neither case prints anything on the screen...
