Question: When assessing the security of a mobile application against reverse engineering, various detection methods can be employed. Consider the following methods. Which are plausible strategies for detecting the presence of the Frida instrumentation framework on an iOS device, and which could be trivial to bypass?
"A": "Checking the list of loaded dynamic libraries in an app for libraries with names including 'frida' using the `_dyld_get_image_name` function.",
"B": "Detecting the presence of the `frida-server` running as a daemon on the device by querying the `CommandLine` interface for running processes.",
"C": "Inspecting the application's `<Application>.app` directory for an embedded Frida gadget such as `FridaGadget.dylib`.",
"D": "Using radare2/iaito or Ghidra to patch the binary and disable the anti-reverse engineering functionality of the application."
