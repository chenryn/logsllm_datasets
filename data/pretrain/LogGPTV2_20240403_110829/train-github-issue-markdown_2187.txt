After following the directions in the guide, I am unable to hit breakpoints in
Code for the React application. I've found no way, using Next 8, to get source
maps emitted, and I think that is likely related. As it stands when I launch
Chrome from Code, nothing happens. Also when launching from Code, you don't
get all of your Chrome plugins, so I have tried using an attach process and
starting Chrome with CLI parameters for debugging, and that does not work
either.
Any input would be appreciated - I think the docs need to be updated to better
reflect the complete set of requirements around debugging.
