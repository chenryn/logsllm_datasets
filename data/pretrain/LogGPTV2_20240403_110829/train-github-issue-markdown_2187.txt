After following the instructions in the guide, I am unable to set breakpoints in the React application code. I have not found a way to generate source maps using Next.js version 8, and I suspect this might be related to the issue. When I launch Chrome from Visual Studio Code, nothing happens. Additionally, launching Chrome from Visual Studio Code does not provide access to all of my Chrome extensions. I have also tried attaching the process and starting Chrome with command-line parameters for debugging, but this approach has not been successful either.

Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated. I believe the documentation needs to be updated to better reflect the complete set of requirements and steps for debugging.
