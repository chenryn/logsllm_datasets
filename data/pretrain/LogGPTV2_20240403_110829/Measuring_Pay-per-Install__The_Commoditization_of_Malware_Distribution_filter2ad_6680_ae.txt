also observe that many downloaders employ a simple
download-and-execute strategy, which in turn suggests
that defenders might realize signiﬁcant protections by
employing taint-based approaches that identify the ex-
ecution of downloaded data.

Inﬁltrating the PPI C&C protocols required
signiﬁcant reverse-engineering effort on our part. As
miscreants become aware of this possibility and more
parties launch inﬁltration attempts, adversarial evolu-
tion will surely complicate this process.
In particular,
we expect PPI services to harden their C&C protocols
with more robust use of cryptographic techniques and
incorporation of anti-virtualization and triggering mech-
anisms to increasingly hamper dynamic analysis. On the
other hand, the fact that a relatively modest inﬁltration
effort sufﬁced to gain insight into many of today’s top
malware families is encouraging. Analysts should re-
main on the lookout for opportunities to inﬁltrate core
components of the modern malware ecosystem, which
may offer broad insights into the malware landscape.
6 Conclusion
We have presented the results of the ﬁrst systematic study
of the pay-per-install (PPI) ecosystem, conducted by in-
ﬁltrating the malware distribution mechanism of PPI ser-
vices. The ability to “milk” malware binaries directly
from the source provides an unprecedented intelligence
capability to defenders. We leveraged this approach
to measure technical aspects of the market surrounding
malware installation.
Starting with a network-behavioral classiﬁcation of a
one-month corpus of 313,791 binaries, we identiﬁed 12
of the 20 most prevalent families of malware. We illus-
trated how infection with several clickfraud and fake-AV
families speciﬁcally target the United States and Europe,
while other malware classes, such as spam bots, are dis-
tributed worldwide. Our examination of repacking rates
of PPI-distributed malware showed that on average bina-
ries are repacked every 11 days, with one family of mal-
ware repacking up to twice a day. Finally, we illuminated
the relationships among actors in the PPI ecosystem, in-
cluding the identiﬁcation of LoaderAdv and GoldInstall
afﬁliates that apparently engage in pricing arbitrage by
becoming clients to other PPI providers.

A Examples of Signatures
This appendix provides a concrete view of several of the
malware signatures that appear in Table 3. We include
four popular-but-untagged clusters, and two versions of
Palevo for reference.
Each signature consists of
three parts: URL,
DOMAIN, and PAYLOAD statements followed by
associated contents.
The URL can contain regular
expressions; we only use it for HTTP-based protocols.
DOMAINS can list IP addresses or domains (with or
without subdomains). PAYLOAD statements specify the
parameters for where, type, contents, and len.
where speciﬁes the location to match, with “begin”
meaning at the beginning of the payload. We use type
to inform the engine whether to interpret the contents as
a string or as an array of bytes. Finally, len restricts the
length of the checked packet: a signature that speciﬁes a
len will only match if the packet has exactly the given
length in bytes.
