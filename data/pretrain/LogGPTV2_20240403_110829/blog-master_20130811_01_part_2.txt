3\. 数组的元素值排行统计  
例如有一个表中记录了客户允许的应用程序信息, 应用程序存储为一个数组, 程序以id形式存到数组中.  
如果要统计全国终端中最火爆的程序排行.   
```  
digoal=# create table test_2(id serial primary key, appid int[], crt_time timestamp);  
CREATE TABLE  
```  
假设appid为0-10的程序比较火爆, 模拟100秒插入请求.  
```  
vi test.sql  
insert into test_2(appid) select array_agg(appid) appid_agg from (select round(10*random())::int as appid from generate_series(1,20)) t;  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> pgbench -M prepared -n -r -f ./test.sql -c 16 -j 4 -T 100 digoal  
transaction type: Custom query

query mode: prepared  
number of clients: 16  
number of threads: 4

number of transactions actually processed: 389701  
tps = 3896.755035 (including connections establishing)  
tps = 3897.686073 (excluding connections establishing)  
statement latencies in milliseconds:  
        4.103117        insert into test_2(appid) select array_agg(appid) appid_agg from (select round(10*random())::int as appid from generate_series(1,20)) t;  
```  
假设appid为10以上的程序不火爆,  模拟10秒插入请求.  
```  
vi test.sql  
insert into test_2(appid) select array_agg(appid) appid_agg from (select round(1000*random())::int as appid from generate_series(1,20)) t;  
pg93@db-172-16-3-33-> pgbench -M prepared -n -r -f ./test.sql -c 16 -j 4 -T 10 digoal  
transaction type: Custom query  
scaling factor: 1  
query mode: prepared  
number of clients: 16  
number of threads: 4  
duration: 10 s  
number of transactions actually processed: 37256  
tps = 3718.362208 (including connections establishing)  
tps = 3725.838361 (excluding connections establishing)  
statement latencies in milliseconds:  
        4.290334        insert into test_2(appid) select array_agg(appid) appid_agg from (select round(1000*random())::int as appid from generate_series(1,20)) t;  
```  
总记录数如下 :   
```  
digoal=# select count(*) from test_2;  
 count    
--------  
 472583  
(1 row)  
```  
收集统计信息  
```  
digoal=# analyze verbose test_2;  
INFO:  analyzing "public.test_2"  
INFO:  "test_2": scanned 8184 of 8184 pages, containing 472583 live rows and 0 dead rows; 30000 rows in sample, 472583 estimated total rows  
ANALYZE  
```  
通过group by和order by获取实际的排名 :   
```  
digoal=# select appid,count(*) from (select unnest(appid) as appid from test_2) t group by appid order by count(*) desc limit 20;  
 appid | count    
-------+--------  
     9 | 872831  
     6 | 871908  
     3 | 871867  
     7 | 871551  
     8 | 871436  
     4 | 871391  
     1 | 871051  
     5 | 870770  
     2 | 870692  
    10 | 435583  
     0 | 435342  
   387 |    831  
    69 |    824  
   665 |    822  
   703 |    816  
   651 |    811  
   520 |    809  
   435 |    809  
   783 |    806  
   671 |    806  
(20 rows)  
```  
接下来要用9.2新增的array 统计信息查看排名了 :   
注意元素的收集个数为default_statistics_target 的10倍, 这个可以参考源码 :   
```  
+   /*  
+    * Set up static pointer for use by subroutines.  We wait till here in  
+    * case std_compute_stats somehow recursively invokes us (probably not  
+    * possible, but ...)  
+    */  
+   array_extra_data = extra_data;  
+  
+   /*  
+    * We want statistics_target * 10 elements in the MCELEM array. This  
+    * multiplier is pretty arbitrary, but is meant to reflect the fact that  
+    * the number of individual elements tracked in pg_statistic ought to be  
+    * more than the number of values for a simple scalar column.  
+    */  
+   num_mcelem = stats->attr->attstattarget * 10;  
```  
所以默认default_statistics_target=100的情况下, 将会收集1000个数组型元素的出现概率.  
```  
digoal=# select array_length(most_common_elems,1),array_length(most_common_elem_freqs,1) from pg_stats where tablename='test_2' and attname='appid';  
-[ RECORD 1 ]+-----  
array_length | 1000  
array_length | 1003  
most_common_elem_freqs中最后3个的值代表min, max, null_freqs. 具体见  
```  
[《PostgreSQL 9.2 add array elements statistics》](../201205/20120518_01.md)    
如果把统计信息修改为50, 那么统计信息的元素个数将变成500.  
```  
digoal=# alter table test_2 alter column appid set statistics 50;
