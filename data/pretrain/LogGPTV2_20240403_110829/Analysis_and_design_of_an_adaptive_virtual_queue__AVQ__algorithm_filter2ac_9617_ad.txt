feedback delay for which the system is stable for a given α.
We will then show that we can use the same technique to
show that given a feedback delay d, one can ﬁnd the maxi-
mum value of α for which the system is stable. We will then
discuss the impact of the number of users on the stability of
the system. We will formalize these ideas in this section.
When d = 0, i.e., there is no feedback delay in the system,
the characteristic equation reduces to:
s + K11 + K12 + α
K2
s
= 0.
(12)
Solving the quadratic equation, we get:
−(K11 + K12) ±(cid:8)
s =
(K11 + K12)2 − 4αK2
2
.
If 4αK2 ≤ (K11 + K12)2, then the system has all real roots
which lie strictly in the left half-plane. If 4αK2 > (K11 +
K12)2, then the system has complex roots that also lie strictly
in the left half-plane. Thus, for all values of α > 0, the sys-
tem is stable.
The following theorem gives the necessary condition on
the RTT for the stability of the system given by (4) and (5).

Example 2. Consider the same setting as in Example 1.
such that the
∗
,
= 0.10. Therefore, for all α  ˆN , the system
is stable.
Proof: Note that in this case, K11, K12, and K2 are all
functions of N. We can easily show that as N increases, K11
increases, K12 decreases, K2 decreases and ω(α, d, N, γ) de-
creases. Using this and following along the lines of the proof
for Theorem 4, we can show that for all N > ˆN , the system
is stable.
Remarks: One of the most important applications of The-
orem 5 comes in the design of α. The system is initially
designed for a low value of N = ˆN , and a particular d. We
∗
can now use Theorem 4 to ﬁnd the value of α
that will lead
to stability. However, Theorem 5 assures us that the system
will still be stable when the number of users increases be-
yond ˆN . We can state a similar theorem for the utilization
γ of the link.
Theorem 6. Fix the feedback delay ˆd, number of users ˆN
and the smoothing parameter ˆα. Find ˆγ satisfying:

where ω is as given in (13). Then, for all γ < ˆγ, the system
is stable.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented an easily implementable AQM
called the Adaptive Virtual Queue and provided simple de-
sign rules to choose its parameters. We then showed through
simulations that the AVQ controller performs better than a
number of other well-known AQM schemes.
