Assistant: This log chunk is related to the synchronization of data between a device and a cloud. At 22:31:59, the total detail steps for the day were set to 1514039400000##7189##549659##8661##16256##28164276. At 22:32:00, the time tick action was processed. At 22:32:28, the autoSync switch was opened and the dataPrivacy and userPrivacy switches were both set to true. However, the sync failed due to no cloud version. At 22:33:00, the time tick action was processed again. At 22:33:09, the stand step changed to 3761 and the total detail steps for the day were set to 1514039520000##7189##549659##8661##16256##28234547.
