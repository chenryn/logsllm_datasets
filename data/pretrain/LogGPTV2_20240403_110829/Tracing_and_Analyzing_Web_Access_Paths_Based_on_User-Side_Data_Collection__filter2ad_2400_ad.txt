### 5. Preemptive Domain Filtering Scheme

The hazardous paths generated by the scheme proposed in Section 3 can be used to enhance user protection. In this section, we introduce a preemptive domain filtering scheme based on the risk level evaluation of domains on these hazardous paths.

#### 5.1 Identifying Hazardous Domains

Malicious URLs are typically included in blacklists; however, there are non-blacklisted URLs that lead to malicious URLs. We define domains with a high probability of leading to malicious URLs as "hazardous domains." By identifying and taking countermeasures against such domains (e.g., adding them to blacklists or alerting users), access to malicious URLs can be minimized. Figure 6 illustrates the concept of the proposed preemptive domain filtering scheme. The figure shows an access path tree consisting of multiple access paths that reach seven different URLs, four of which are included in a blacklist. The proposed scheme calculates the probability of reaching malicious URLs from a domain and identifies it as hazardous if the probability exceeds a certain threshold value. For example, accesses through domains B and C lead only to blacklisted URLs, so they are considered hazardous.

We evaluated the risk levels of all domains on hazardous paths using the proposed scheme. Table 7 lists the top 10 newly identified domains with a risk level above 50%, and Table 8 shows those with a risk level of 100% over 12 months, excluding domains already identified by Google Safe Browsing (GSB). The maximum risk level column indicates the highest monthly risk level for a domain during the 12 months, while the number of months column shows how many months the domain appeared on hazardous paths. As shown, the proposed scheme can identify non-blacklisted domains that are likely to navigate users to malicious URLs.

Table 9 breaks down the number of domains on hazardous paths by risk levels. To protect users, if the risk level of a domain is above a certain threshold, we can filter traffic on that domain or issue alerts. Setting the threshold to 80%, 355 additional domains are identified as hazardous, in addition to the 619 domains already identified by GSB.

#### 5.2 Blocked URLs

By enforcing the proposed preemptive domain filtering scheme and blocking access to hazardous domains, some URLs will become unreachable. To determine the effectiveness of this blocking, we identified URLs that would have been blocked using our dataset. The scheme requires a threshold value to identify hazardous domains, and we set this value to 80%. The unreachable URLs fall into the following categories:

1. **Blacklisted URLs**: The proposed scheme blocks access to hazardous domains on the way to blacklisted URLs, preventing users from reaching these URLs, even though they are already blocked by existing blacklists. Note that we used GSB for the blacklist, but other blacklists can be used for preemptive filtering.

2. **URLs Included in Other Blacklists**: These URLs were not blacklisted by GSB but were known to be malicious by other blacklists. We used a proprietary blacklist that identifies malicious URLs based on URL string signatures. However, the number of these URLs remains small, likely due to differences in blacklist policies. GSB tends to identify more social-engineering type URLs and fewer malware-related URLs compared to the proprietary blacklist we used.

3. **Non-Blacklisted URLs with the Same Domain as Blacklisted URLs**: It may take time for GSB to register a malicious URL, so it may not be registered when a user visits it. These URLs should eventually be blacklisted, and sometimes their domain is listed instead of the specific URL.

4. **Unreachable URLs**: These URLs are already unreachable at the time of writing. Malicious URLs often disappear after a period, so the likelihood that these URLs are malicious is not negligible.

5. **URLs with Illegitimate or Harmful Content**: Many blocked URLs that do not fit the above categories deal with pornography, scanned manga and books, and music and video files. None of these URLs are listed in the Alexa Top 1,000 sites globally during the observation period. Although the proprietary blacklist did not recognize these URLs as malicious, their legitimacy depends on the policy of each blacklist. These pages are likely irrelevant to most users' daily lives, so the impact of making them unreachable is limited.

These blocked URLs are either malicious, unreachable, illegitimate, or harmful, and blocking them helps improve user protection without impairing legitimate activities.

### 6. Discussion and Analysis

Each technique has been discussed and evaluated in earlier sections. This section addresses issues related to our data collection and analysis approaches, limitations of our dataset, and directions for further analyses.

#### 6.1 Advantages of User-Side Data Collection

The uniqueness of our approach lies in user-side data collection, which provides various data from browser users that cannot be collected on the network. This data offers two key advantages: analytical efficiency and access to user-side data.

1. **Analytical Efficiency**: The collected data includes user IDs and browser tab IDs, allowing us to filter and narrow down the data by user ID and browser tab ID. This minimizes data complexity and ambiguity, leading to more accurate analysis and reducing the cost and time required.

2. **Access to User-Side Data**: We can obtain data unavailable from network-collected data, such as detailed user behavior and preferences.

#### 6.2 Limitations of Our Dataset

Our dataset has some limitations that should be considered for further analysis. First, the demographics of the users of the browser extension are limited, as we distribute the extension to people who like the Tachikoma character. These users tend to be IT-savvy, and their web usage may not represent general web users. Additionally, the browser extension and its distribution page are only available in Japanese, limiting the scope of the data.

To address these limitations, we plan to expand our user base and offer the browser extension in multiple languages.
