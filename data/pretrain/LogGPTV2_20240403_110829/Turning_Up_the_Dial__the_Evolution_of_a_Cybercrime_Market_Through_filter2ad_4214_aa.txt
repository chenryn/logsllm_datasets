## Abstract
Trust and reputation are fundamental in underground cybercrime markets, where participants are anonymous and legal recourse for dispute resolution is limited. These markets operate in a delicate balance between the need to hide incriminating information and the benefits of greater transparency, which fosters trust and stability. Revealing transaction details to prevent scams also provides valuable data about the market. This study analyzes the first comprehensive dataset, to our knowledge, of transactions on Hack Forums, a high-traffic underground marketplace, along with associated user threads and posts from June 2018 to June 2020. We use statistical modeling to examine the economic and social characteristics of the market over three distinct eras, focusing on its role as an infrastructure for trust.

In the Set-up era, we observe the growth of one-time users and "power-users" who engage in multiple transactions. During the Stable era, a wide range of activities, including large-scale transfers of intermediate currencies like Amazon Gift Cards, gradually declines from an initial peak. Finally, during the Covid-19 era, we see a significant increase in transactions across all categories, reflecting a stimulus to the market rather than a transformation. New users overcome the "cold start" problem by engaging in low-level currency exchanges to establish their trustworthiness. Currency exchange accounts for most contracts, with Bitcoin and PayPal being the preferred payment methods. Over time, the market becomes more centralized around influential users and threads, with notable changes observed during the Set-up and Covid-19 eras.

## 1. Introduction
Online illicit marketplaces are a critical component of the cybercrime economy, facilitating the cashing out of earnings, trading malware, and obtaining compromised credit cards. Trust and reputation are particularly important in these markets due to the anonymity of users, which often leads to fraud. Underground markets have developed mechanisms such as reputation systems, vouching, escrow services, and verified status to mitigate these issues. While previous research has focused on vendor ratings and public feedback, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of contractual data from Hack Forums, a well-known and high-traffic cybercrime forum.

Hack Forums recently introduced a dedicated marketplace to facilitate the exchange and trade of goods and services, logging contracts to manage trust and reputation. This adaptation provides a unique opportunity for academic research. Our study aims to explore the longitudinal evolution of conflict, trust, and activity in this marketplace, using Tuckman’s stages of group development as a theoretical framework.

## 2. Analyzing Online Marketplaces
### 2.1 Products and Services
Online underground marketplaces offer a diverse range of products and services, including illicit drugs, malware, and stolen data. Forums remain popular platforms for establishing business and social connections, featuring reputation systems and hierarchical moderation to exert social control.

### 2.2 Related Work
Machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) have been used to analyze marketplaces at scale. For example, Sun et al. [23] used machine learning to detect private interactions on Nulled forum, while NLP methods have been applied to identify transaction-related posts and extract product and price information [22].

Afroz et al. [1] identified common features of successful forums, including top-down governance, norm-conforming behaviors, and enforcement mechanisms. Holt [9] analyzed Russian forums, finding that member relationships are influenced by price, customer service, and trust. Allodi et al. [2] examined factors contributing to the success of online markets, including market stability and resiliency of cybercrime tools.

### 2.3 Theoretical Approach
To examine the evolution of the Hack Forums marketplace, we divide the timespan into three eras: Set-up (from June 2018 to March 2019), Stable (from March 2019 to March 2020), and Covid-19 (from March 2020 to June 2020). We draw on Tuckman’s stages of group development (forming, storming, norming, performing) to make sense of the changes observed in the data, particularly in terms of trust, collaboration, and conflict.

## 3. Dataset
We provide the first analysis of contractual transactions on Hack Forums, a high-traffic and well-known underground forum. Our dataset, part of the CrimeBB dataset [19], includes nearly 190,000 real contracts created by users from June 2018 to June 2020. Each contract includes details of the goods and services exchanged, obligations, agreement terms, and party ratings.

### 3.1 The Contract System
On Hack Forums, a contract is an agreement between members for trading goods or services. Contracts were optional when introduced in June 2018 but became mandatory from March 2019. While some transactions may still occur outside the system, users are incentivized to use it for gaining reputation and protection, such as dispute resolution.

While some transactions may be completed outside the contract system, the regulation was strictly enforced, and users are incentivized to use the system for reputation and protection.
