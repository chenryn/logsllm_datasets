ABSTRACT
Trust and reputation play a core role in underground cybercrime
markets, where participants are anonymous and there is little le-
gal recourse for dispute arbitration. These underground markets
exist in tension between two opposing forces: the drive to hide
incriminating information, and the trust and stability benefits that
greater openness yields. Revealing information about transactions
to mitigate scams also provides valuable data about the market. We
analyse the first dataset, of which we are aware, about the trans-
actions created and completed on a well-known and high-traffic
underground marketplace, Hack Forums, along with the associated
threads and posts made by its users over two recent years, from
June 2018 to June 2020. We use statistical modelling approaches to
analyse the economic and social characteristics of the market over
three eras, especially its performance as an infrastructure for trust.
In the Set-up era, we observe the growth of users making only one
transaction, as well as ‘power-users’ who make many transactions.
In the Stable era, we observe a wide range of activities (including
large-scale transfers of intermediate currencies such as Amazon
Giftcards) which declines slowly from an initial peak. Finally, we
analyse the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, concluding that while
we see a significant increase in transactions across all categories,
this reflects a stimulus of the market, rather than a transforma-
tion. New users overcome the ‘cold start’ problem by engaging in
low-level currency exchanges to prove their trustworthiness. We
observe currency exchange accounts for most contracts, and Bitcoin
and PayPal are the preferred payment methods by trading values
and number of contracts involved. The market is becoming more
centralised over time around influential users and threads, with
significant changes observed during the Set-up and Covid-19 eras.

1 INTRODUCTION
Online illicit marketplaces are a key part of the cybercrime economy,
enabling malicious actors to cash out earnings, trade in malware,
and obtain compromised credit cards. Trust and reputation are
key aspects of any market, but particularly so in cybercrime mar-
kets, where user anonymity means that ‘ripping’ or defrauding
customers is common. Underground markets have adapted to this
problem of ‘lemonisation’ by providing reputation and vouching
systems, escrow systems, and verified status to minimise informa-
tion asymmetry [10, 11, 16, 17, 21, 27]. While previous research
has focused on vendor ratings and public feedback, there are few
datasets as comprehensive as the one we analyse in this paper.
On the longest-running and most popular cybercrime forum,
a market has been active for some time. Previously, users posted
advertisements while transactions were finalised off-site. Hack Fo-
rums does not officially offer a formal escrow service, however, in
reaction to widespread concerns about abuse, the administrators
recently (June 2018) opened a dedicated marketplace to facilitate
the exchange and trade in goods and services where contracts
are logged. This appears to be primarily used as a reputation and
trust management system, in which transaction details are visible
to forum users on payment of a small fee. This trust adaptation
presents a unique opportunity for academic research. In this paper,
we present an extensive analysis of this burgeoning market. We
are particularly interested in exploring the longitudinal evolution
of conflict, trust, and activity of different kinds – we consider this
marketplace to be an example of a disparate group of actors coming
together (with their own diverse motivations) to work on a joint en-
deavour. Thus, we draw on Tuckman’s stages of group development
(discussed in Section 2.2) to guide our analysis.
Our dataset provides valuable insights into the economic ac-
tivity linked to the forum, and how an underground marketplace
evolves. The dataset begins from the start of this system, with de-
tails of goods traded, currency types and amount, time taken for
transactions to complete, and in some cases Bitcoin addresses for
transactions. First, we describe the dataset and its characteristics
in §3. As this kind of ‘social’ data is not originally generated for
research purposes, it requires additional interpretation, so we in-
clude findings from our exploratory analysis of the data in this
section where they are useful for making sense of the dataset and

what it represents. We then provide a descriptive economic analysis,
outlining how much money is being made, by how many users, and
from what goods and services (§4). We also identify the preferred
payment methods used and the top merchandise being traded. In §5,
we use statistical approaches to explore the market’s longitudinal
evolution, how users overcome the ‘cold start’ problem, as well as
the trust and reputation functions facilitated by this marketplace. In
§6, we draw major insights observed from our analyses over three
eras. We then discuss the contributions to the security community
and the limitations of our work in §7. Ethical issues are discussed in
the Appendix. The dataset is made available for academia through
data sharing agreements so that other academic researchers can
fully reproduce our experiments and build further analyses based
on our results.
2 ANALYSING ONLINE MARKETPLACES
The products and services available in online underground mar-
ketplaces are diverse, ranging from illicit drugs [6], malicious soft-
ware [12], to stolen data [7, 10, 11]. Forums remain a popular plat-
form as they provide an easy way to establish business and social
connections [27]. As platforms, forums contain features such as
reputation systems and hierarchical levels of moderators and ad-
ministrators that allow for the exertion of social control on the
community [1, 7, 16, 27]. A pivotal question is how members of
anonymous illicit marketplaces can trust each other. This is impor-
tant to the sustainability of a marketplace, as trust increases actual
purchases [8, 20]. Underground markets use various techniques to
facilitate trust, including vendor verification and reputation sys-
tems [10, 16, 27]. Moderators promote trust by verifying users and
excluding scammers [7, 11, 16]. Member activity may also act as a
signal of trust, as experienced users tend to be perceived as trust-
worthy [7, 10, 11, 27]. While existing literature mainly relied on
feedback from users, our research provides insights on the topic
with contractual data on created and completed transactions.
2.1 Related Work
Machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) methods
have been used to analyse marketplaces at scale. For example, Sun et
al. [23] propose a machine learning-based approach to detect private
interactions on the Nulled forum, where they examine the trading
activities and monetisation methods of members. NLP methods
have been used to identify the function and intent of messages [5],
identify posts related to transactions and to extract products and
prices [22], and to identify supply chains [3].
Afroz et al. [1] identify common features across successful fo-
rums, including top-down governance, norm-conforming behaviors
from members, frequent communication, and the use of enforce-
ment such as fines and bans. Holt [9] qualitatively analysed ten
publicly accessible Russian forums, finding the relationship be-
tween members is influenced by price, customer service, and trust.
Allodi et al. [2] investigated factors contributing to the success of
online markets by analysing marketplace models, preferences of
online traders, market stability, and resiliency of cybercrime tools.
A subset of research takes a network-based approach in analysing
the dynamics of transactions within underground marketplaces.
The study by Motoyama et al. [16] analyses six underground forums
(not including Hack Forums) by building the social networks based
on private messages, friend status and thread posting behaviour.
Their dataset contains descriptive information, such as forum posts,
private messages, user logs and user registration data; however, it
lacks transactions made by the forum members.
2.2 Theoretical Approach
To examine the evolution and maturation of the Hack Forums
marketplace, we split the timespan into three eras. We draw on
Tuckman’s [24] stages of group development, which proposes that
established groups go through four stages: forming, storming, norm-
ing, and performing. Our first two ‘eras’ are Set-up (forming and
storming), from when the contract system was adopted (1 June 2018)
to before the time contracts become mandatory (1 March 2019),
and Stable (norming), from the end of Set-up to before 11 March
2020. At the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 began to spread globally,
with a global pandemic declared by the World Health Organisation
(WHO) on 11 March 2020 [26]. This coincides with an uptick in
the number of contracts on the forum, representing the performing
stage. We name this most recent era Covid-19, which spans from
11 March 2020 to the end of the data collection period on 30 June
2020. In some figures, we denote the three eras as E1, E2, and E3.
It bears noting that the events which we use to define these
eras play a deductive rather than inductive role in our analysis –
they are imposed by us in order to analyse the effects of external
factors, rather than arising from the data. We use Tuckman’s stages
in our analysis to make sense of the changes we observe in our
data which correspond to these external events; namely, how they
appear to reflect the evolution of trust, collaboration and conflict
in this marketplace. Tuckman’s stages of group development as-
sumes group membership is static. However, as with many online
networks, users of underground markets are transient. Therefore,
we also consider how users overcome the cold start problem [13, 15]
in this context. Here, the ‘cold start’ problem refers to the difficul-
ties faced by new users who find that others do not want to trade
with them due to lack of reputation, but cannot gain reputation as
nobody will trade with them. While the ‘cold start’ problem is a
well-recognised issue for recommendation systems, we believe we
are the first to consider it in relation to underground markets.
3 DATASET
We provide the first analysis, of which we are aware, of contrac-
tual transactions made in the underlying marketplace on one of
the most high-traffic and well-known online underground forums
Hack Forums. Our data, newly collected as a part of the CrimeBB
dataset [19], contains nearly 190,000 real contracts created by users
over two years from June 2018 to June 2020. The contracts repre-
sent transactions, and some are linked with the advertising threads
and discussion posts which provides additional context. Each con-
tract includes the goods and services being exchanged, obligations,
agreement terms, and the ratings of the parties involved.
The Contract System. On Hack Forums, a contract is an agree-
ment between members for trading goods or services. Contracts
were optional when first introduced to the forum in June 2018.
However, on 30 January 2019, it was announced that contracts
would be mandatory for all deals from 1 March 2019. While some

transactions may be completed outside the contract system, in pri-
vate channels such as direct messages, the regulation was strictly
adopted, as it was announced that those avoiding the system would
face account closure. This avoidance, if it occurs, might lead to inac-
curate measurements in this study, however, as the system allows
private contracts which do not reveal the goods being exchanged,
we believe users are incentivised to use the system as it enables
them to gain reputation and provides a certain level of protection
(e.g., opening disputes) if anything goes wrong with a transaction.
