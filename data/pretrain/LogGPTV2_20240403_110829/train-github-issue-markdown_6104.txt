Just a remark, though: the default key bindings for "Shrink/expand selection"
(Shift+Alt+Left/Right) conflict with a feature that doesn't exist yet, but
which I hope will be implemented someday: column selection. In Visual Studio,
and many other editors, if you hold Alt at the same time as you change the
selection with Shift+arrows, it changes the selection across multiple lines.
So Shift+Alt+arrows should be reserved for column selection, unless you plan
to never implement this (very useful) feature.
