This led to a significant performance problem in the `threefry2x32`
implementation when it was changed to use a `dynamic_slice` as part of its
implementation and when batched as part of the `gamma` implementation. If we
cannot prove that `i` is equal across batch elements, `x[i]` turns into a
relatively expensive gather of scalars, but if we know `x` and `i` are
unbatched, it remains a dynamic slice.
