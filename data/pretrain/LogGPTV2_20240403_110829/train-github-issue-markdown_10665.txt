##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => :4.4.0:
  * Operating System / Platform => Ubuntu 20.04
  * Compiler => GCC 8.4
##### Detailed description
I am loading a pre-trained SSD from TensorFlow and setting the target as
preferred backend as CUDA. I am running Cuda 10.2 with cuDNN 8.0.2 and I have
built OpenCV. Following code to load the model
        cv::dnn::Net net = cv::dnn::readNetFromTensorflow("/Models/frozen_inference_graph.pb",
                                            "/graph.pbtxt");
        net.setPreferableBackend(cv::dnn::DNN_BACKEND_CUDA); 
        net.setPreferableTarget(cv::dnn::DNN_TARGET_CUDA); 
And I get the following error -
    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::dnn::cuda4dnn::csl::cudnn::cuDNNException'
    what():  OpenCV(4.4.0) /home/atharva/opencv-4.4.0/modules/dnn/src/layers/../cuda4dnn/primitives/../csl/cudnn/convolution.hpp:420: error: (-217:Gpu API call) CUDNN_STATUS_BAD_PARAM in function 'convolve'
Could you please point what could be goig wrong?
