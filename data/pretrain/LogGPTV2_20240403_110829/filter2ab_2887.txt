**ATT&CK ID:** M0948  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application Isolation and Sandboxing

**Description:**
Implementing application isolation and sandboxing can significantly hinder adversaries from advancing their operations by exploiting undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities. This technique confines applications to a controlled environment, limiting their access to system resources and reducing the potential impact of an attack. Additionally, other forms of virtualization and application microsegmentation can further mitigate the risks associated with various types of exploitation. However, it is important to note that these measures may still be susceptible to new exploits and inherent weaknesses in the systems themselves. [4]
