### Boundary Constraint and Vector Computation

- **Boundary Constraint**: The boundary constraint is derived from Lemma 2. Vectors \( \mathbf{a}_u \) and \( \mathbf{b}_u \) represent the constant terms for the upper boundary constraint.
- **Distortion Vector and Voronoi Diagram**: From the distortion vector \( \boldsymbol{\delta} \) returned by the optimization problem and the estimated lengths \( \mathbf{l} \), we compute the augmented Voronoi diagram.
- **Reconstructed Database**: Using the computed Voronoi diagram and the offset vector \( \boldsymbol{\delta} \) from the optimization problem, we derive the reconstructed database by substituting into the formulas of Lemma 5 in [33].
- **Output**: The final output is the reconstructed values \( \tilde{v}_0, \ldots, \tilde{v}_{n-1} \).

### Evaluation on the Spitz Dataset

**Experiment Setup**:
- **Dataset**: We evaluate the performance of AGNOSTIC-RECONSTRUCTION-KNN on a public real-world dataset, specifically the geolocation data of politician Malte Spitz, which was also used in [33].
- **Data Period**: The geolocation data for October 1 to 31, 2009, is considered.
- **Data Reduction**: The 2D geolocation data is reduced to 1D using a Hilbert curve of order 8, resulting in a universe size \( N = 65536 \) and a dataset size \( n = 258 \).
- **Query Distributions**: The query distributions tested include discretized Beta distributions (Permuted-Beta(α, β)) and a Gaussian distribution centered at Hannover, Germany.

**Results**:
- **Number of Queries**: The adversary observed \( Q = 25 \times 10^5 \) queries, which is 100 times smaller than the sample size in [33].
- **Error Analysis**: Each attack was repeated 50 times, and Figure 13 shows the average absolute relative error. The reconstruction under the Permuted-Beta(1,10) distribution, which is power-law-like, is the most challenging due to its skewness and sample size, with relative errors ranging from 15% to 20%. The Gaussian query distribution, however, results in accurate reconstructions across all values of \( k \).

### Evaluation on Synthetic Dataset

**Experiment Setup**:
- **Database Generation**: Synthetic databases were generated with varying densities and query distributions, with \( N = 10^3 \) and \( k \in \{2, 5, 10, 20, 50\} \).
- **Query Distributions**: The query distributions tested include Permuted-Beta(α, β) with different parameters.

**Results**:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Figure 14 shows the average MAE over 100 repetitions with \( Q = 10^5 \). For sparse databases, the distances between values are larger, leading to a larger feasible region and more possible valid reconstructions. The MAE increases with higher \( k \) values, even for the uniform case (Permuted-Beta(1,1)). For densities greater than 20%, the reconstruction is usually within a distance of 20 from the plaintext value for all tested query distributions.

### Related Work

- **Encrypted Single-Keyword Search**: Previous work [4], [9], [11], [15], [23], [31], [41], [43] has shown that access pattern leakage can be vulnerable to query recovery attacks. Specific studies by Islam et al. [30], Cash et al. [8], and Zhang et al. [45] provide query-recovery attacks under various assumptions.
- **Expressive Queries**: Systems with more expressive queries [39] rely on cryptographic primitives like order-preserving encryption, which are vulnerable to data-recovery attacks [20], [28], [38] using setup leakage.
- **Efficiency**: Several works [1], [2], [10], [16], [18] have studied the impact of locality on searchable encryption efficiency.
- **Reconstruction Attacks**: State-of-the-art plaintext reconstruction attacks from range queries [27], [32], [34] and k-NN queries [33] are reviewed. Recent work [37] improves the asymptotic complexity of reconstruction from range queries under uniform query distribution using search pattern leakage.

### Discussion and Open Problems

- **Limitations**: Our proposed attacks are effective for a wide range of realistic query distributions but fail for specific distributions, such as when all probability mass is assigned to a single query or when queries only touch the first half of the universe.
- **Characterization of Vulnerable Distributions**: An open problem is to characterize the family of query distributions that are vulnerable to our attacks.
- **High-Dimensional Data**: Another open problem is to analyze whether similar attacks can be mounted on high-dimensional data.
- **Advanced Constructions**: There are efficient constructions [17], [22] with better storage efficiency and less information leakage. An open problem is to develop efficient reconstruction attacks for these advanced constructions.
- **Response-Hiding Schemes**: These schemes, which hide the overlap of records between responses, are immune to previous and current attacks. An open problem is to analyze whether any reconstruction attack exists for these schemes.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first attacks on range and k-NN queries on encrypted databases that reconstruct plaintext values without knowledge of the query or data distribution. Prior to our work, it was unclear whether such general leakage-based reconstruction was possible, as previous approaches [27], [32], [33], [34] relied on uniform query distribution or known query and data distributions.
