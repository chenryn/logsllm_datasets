## Abstract
This paper addresses the challenge of entering sensitive data, such as passwords, from an untrusted machine suspected to be infected with spyware. Roaming users often have no choice but to use public machines in internet cafes, airport lounges, or business centers, which may be compromised by keyloggers. We explore methods to enter data in a way that confounds spyware, making it difficult for the attacker to capture the actual password. We present three approaches: embedding the password in random keystrokes, using a proxy server to strip random keys, and employing a proxy to invert a key mapping performed by the user. We also discuss potential attacks and their mitigations.

## 1. Introduction
Attacks targeting user information on client workstations, particularly through spyware, are a growing concern. Keylogging is one of the most insidious threats, exposing passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. While enterprise users and knowledgeable home users can protect themselves, less proficient users and those using public machines are at significant risk. Roaming users who use unfamiliar machines must assume that these machines are potentially infected with spyware. We introduce KLASSP (KeyLogger Avoidance using a Shared Secret Proxy) to address this problem.

### 1.1 The Problem and Limitations of Our Approaches
The primary issue we address is how a user can securely log in to a password-protected account from an untrusted machine. Simply advising against using such machines is impractical, as millions of users do so daily. We focus on protecting passwords, assuming that preventing a password from being compromised is more critical than protecting other data. Our solutions must meet the following requirements:
- No changes to the login server.
- No changes to the browser or client software environment.
- The user's main concern is obscuring the password.
- Collusion among spyware-infected machines is unlikely.

Our general approach involves obscuring the typed password and using a proxy to map the keystrokes to the actual password. We explore two main methods: embedding the password in random keystrokes and using a pre-agreed key mapping with the proxy server.

## 2. Related Work
Recent efforts in desktop security have focused on perimeter defense, including anti-virus and anti-spyware technologies. Some web sites use on-screen keyboards to mitigate keylogging, but these can be attacked through screen captures. Password management systems, both client-based and cloud-based, offer some protection but are ineffective against keyloggers. The Impostor system by Pashalidis and Mitchell [13] is the closest related work, using challenge-response authentication. However, KLASSP differs in that it does not store user passwords, reducing the burden of maintaining up-to-date password information and limiting the attacker's access if the secret is compromised.

## 3. Proposed Solutions
### 3.1 Embedding Password in Random Keystrokes
In this method, the user types the password embedded within random keystrokes. The proxy server then strips the random keystrokes to extract the actual password. This makes it extremely difficult for a keylogger to identify the correct password.

### 3.2 Using a Proxy to Strip Random Keys
Here, the user types the password along with random keystrokes. The proxy server, which has a shared secret with the user, removes the random keystrokes to recover the actual password. This approach requires no additional steps from the user beyond typing the password and random keystrokes.

### 3.3 Inverting a Key Mapping
In this method, the user and the proxy agree on a key mapping in advance. The user types the password using the mapped keys, and the proxy inverts the mapping to obtain the actual password. This approach requires the user to carry a reference to the key mapping, but it provides strong protection against keyloggers.

### 3.4 Potential Attacks and Mitigations
We analyze several potential attacks, including collusion attacks, replay attacks, and social engineering. To mitigate these, we ensure that the proxy server uses dynamic challenges and that the user follows best practices for secure communication.

## 4. Conclusion
KLASSP offers a practical solution for entering passwords on untrusted machines. By using a combination of random keystrokes and a shared-secret proxy, we can significantly reduce the risk of password theft. Future work will focus on further enhancing the security and usability of the system.
