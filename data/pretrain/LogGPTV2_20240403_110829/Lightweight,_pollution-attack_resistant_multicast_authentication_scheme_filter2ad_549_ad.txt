Erasure  codes  and  signature  verification  need  significant 
computational  power.    Unfortunately,  distillation  codes  require 
even more calculations than either of these two computationally 
consuming  operations.  Thus,  PARM  is  more  lightweight  than 
distillation codes. 
5. SECURITY ANALISYS 
In this section, we analyze the degree of difficulty of computing 
valid  evidence  for  a  packet  without  prior  knowledge  of  the  full 
TSK chain. 
For  the  first  case,  we  assume  the  attacker  does  not  possess  any 
element of the TSK. On average, an adversary must guess (2b-1)p
hash  values,  where  b  represents  the  number  of  bits  per  element 
and p  represents  the  number  of  elements  in  each  piece  of 
evidence. The complexity of finding valid evidence for a packet 
can be denoted as O(2bp).
In the second case, we derive the probability Pf of the adversary 
producing  valid  evidence  for  a  packet  given  n  TSK  elements. 
Since each element in the TSK will not be reused, except those 
elements in the first TSK chain, TSK0, we can assume that only 
the  reused  elements  of  TSK0  will  affect  the  security  of  PARM. 
The TSK has a chain length of L and k elements per TSK. If the 
known  elements  are  distributed  among  each  TSK,  then  n/L
denotes the number of these elements in TSK0. Without executing 
the temporal key renewal phase, we derive a tight upper bound for 
Pf.

Equation 5.2 shows that the security strength S increases in direct 
proportion to the number of TSK elements k or TSK chain length 
L  and  decreases  with  the  number  of  used  TSK  elements  n.  The 
security strength S decreases if probability Pf increases too much. 
In  the  final  case,  we  execute  the  temporal  key  renewal  phase,

conclude  that  a  small  threshold  can  sustain  higher  security 
strength than a large threshold; therefore, key renewal is essential 
to guarantee security.

7. CONCLUSION
Pollution  attack 
in  multicast 
is  a 
authentication.  Despite  past  efforts,  researchers  have  not  been 
able to develop an efficient solution. This paper proposes a new 
approach  to  resisting  pollution  attack  that  not  only  offers 
lightweight computational overhead to the sender and receiver but 
also allows the receiver to instantly validate packets without the 
need 
invalid  packets.  The  partial  key  renewal 
mechanism provides a guarantee on a lower bound of the security 
regardless of the amount of disclosed TSK elements. In addition 
to  SAIDA,  other  signature  amortization  schemes  that  rely  on 
fault-tolerant algorithms to defend against pollution attacks could 
benefit from our proposed approach. 
We  provide  an  analysis  on  the  storage,  communication,  and 
computational overhead, demonstrating that our proposed scheme 
is  relatively  lightweight  to  previous  solutions.  We  also  evaluate 
our  scheme  under  various  conditions  to  help  senders  define 
operating parameters suitable for its local network. 
Because 
is 
considerable,  we  aim  to  reduce  the  storage  overhead  in  future 
work.

TSK  chain  length  L  also  influences  the  security  strength  of 
PARM. Applying equation 5.2, we set the evidence size p at 16 
and the number of elements k per TSK at 512. From Figure 6-3, 
we observe that longer TSK chains increase the security strength. 
Since we do not employ the key renewal mechanism in this test, 
the security strength significantly drops as the adversary obtains 
more TSK elements.

Length
Equation 5.4 models the security strength of our scheme with the 
temporal  key  renewal  mechanism  in  effect.  The  key  renewal 
phase  occurs  when  the  number  of  used  TSK  elements  in  TSK0
reaches  a  threshold  T,  forcing  a  partial  renewal  of  the  temporal 
key pair. Figure 6-4, depicts the security strength of PARM under 
different  key  renewal  thresholds  T.  The  x-axis  represents  the 
number  of  transmission  rounds  between  sender  and  receivers. 
Because  the  first  curve  does  not  renew  its  key  pair,  its  security 
strength monotonically decreases. In contrast, the other curves do 
renew  their  keys,  and  thus  can  maintain  a  minimum  level  of 
security.  For  example,  a  threshold  of  200  induces  a  minimum
