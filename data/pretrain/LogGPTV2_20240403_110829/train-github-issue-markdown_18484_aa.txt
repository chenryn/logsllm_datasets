I am currently working behind a proxy and encountering difficulties in configuring the `requests` library to use it. While `urllib2` successfully operates through the proxy, `requests` fails to do so. I have attempted both setting the environment variables (both `HTTPS_PROXY` and `https_proxy`) and providing a dictionary for proxy settings, but neither approach has resolved the issue.

My setup is as follows:
- Operating System: macOS 10.7.5
- Python Version: 2.7.3
- Requests Version: 1.1.0
- The Python environment is managed within a virtual environment created using `pip`.

Here are the details of my environment and the steps I have taken:

### Environment Variables
```
(osx)gfairchild@stueyemac ~> set | grep -i proxy
HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.com:8080
https_proxy=https://proxy.com:8080
```

### Python and `urllib2` Test
```python
(osx)gfairchild@stueyemac ~> python
Python 2.7.3 (v2.7.3:70274d53c1dd, Apr  9 2012, 20:52:43) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin

>>> import urllib2
>>> r = urllib2.urlopen('https://google.com')
>>> print r.read()
# (The response from Google is displayed here)
```

### `requests` Configuration Attempts
1. **Setting Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.com:8080
   export https_proxy=https://proxy.com:8080
   ```

2. **Using a Dictionary for Proxy Settings:**
   ```python
   import requests

   proxies = {
       'http': 'http://proxy.com:8080',
       'https': 'https://proxy.com:8080'
   }

   response = requests.get('https://google.com', proxies=proxies)
   print(response.text)
   ```

Despite these efforts, `requests` continues to fail when attempting to use the proxy. Any suggestions or additional troubleshooting steps would be greatly appreciated.
