I recently upgraded from Python 3.4.2 to 3.4.3 on my Windows 7 system, and I encountered an issue where IDLE would not start. When attempting to uninstall Python 3.4.3 using the Windows Control Panel, I received the following error message: "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program required for this install to complete could not be run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor." The same error occurred when I tried to remove Python using the .msi file.

Additionally, I noticed that there is no Python34 directory present on my machine. However, I found an entry in the Windows Registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\3.4\Modules`. I am hesitant to modify the registry directly, but I am wondering if it is safe to delete this entry. Are there any other related entries that I should also consider removing?

In the end, I used Microsoft's Fix It tool (MicrosoftFixit.ProgramInstallUninstall) to successfully remove Python 3.4.3. Afterward, I reinstalled Python without encountering any further issues.
