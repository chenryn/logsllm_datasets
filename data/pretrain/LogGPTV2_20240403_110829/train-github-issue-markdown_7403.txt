I have a URI template in the form of "/hotels/{hotel}/bookings/{booking}", and
can access the path variables in the controller via `@PathVariable`, but when
building links in the view I need a reference to the different path variables.
As an example, let's say the user requests
"/hotels/Hotelier/bookings/booking-123", and as is a common use case in the
view, there is a need to link back to the bookings listing
"/hotels/Hotelier/bookings/". The only way currently to access the URI
template variables is to manually inject them each time into the view. I
suggest that a tag be created that is capable of building a link from the same
URI template style that is used in the `@RequestMapping`, something like
go.
