Table 8: We trained classiﬁers with 19 different cost models under the box constraint, and we compare them against regular
training (Natural) and three models from Chen’s method [11] with different e. We separate our models by four different cost
families. Each cost family keeps the same proportion between the constraint variables and has the same adaptive attack objective.
The best numbers within each cost family are highlighted in bold. We have also evaluated the recall of the models here4.
