User: It sounds reasonable that the os/rtos would schedule an "Idle task". In that case, wouldn't it be power consuming? (it sounds reasonable that the idle task will execute: while (true) {} )
Assistant: There's always code to run, the idle task is the code if there's nothing else. It may execute a special CPU instruction to power down the CPU until a hardware interrupt arrives. On x86 CPUs it's hlt (halt).
