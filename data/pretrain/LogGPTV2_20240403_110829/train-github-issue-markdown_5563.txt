The `p.form-control-static`, as well as the `label` elements within `div.checkbox` and `div.radio`, always display in black. When I apply a `has-*` state to the parent `form-group`, other form controls are colored correctly, but these specific elements remain unaffected.

To make this clearer and more professional, you might consider:

- Ensuring that the `p.form-control-static`, `label` inside `div.checkbox`, and `label` inside `div.radio` elements are styled appropriately.
- Applying the `has-*` state to the parent `form-group` should affect all child elements, including the ones mentioned above, to ensure consistent styling.
