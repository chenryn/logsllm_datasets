To effectively implement CIS Control 13.6, which focuses on collecting network traffic flow logs, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Enable Network Traffic Flow Logging:**
   - Configure network devices (such as routers, switches, and firewalls) to generate and collect network traffic flow logs. These logs provide detailed information about the traffic traversing the network, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

2. **Centralize Log Collection:**
   - Implement a centralized log management system to aggregate and store the collected network traffic flow logs. This ensures that all relevant data is in one place, making it easier to analyze and manage.

3. **Define Monitoring and Alerting Policies:**
   - Establish clear policies for monitoring and alerting based on the collected logs. Define what types of traffic patterns or anomalies should trigger alerts. For example, unusual spikes in traffic, connections to known malicious IP addresses, or unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Regularly Review and Analyze Logs:**
   - Schedule regular reviews of the network traffic flow logs to identify any suspicious or anomalous activity. Use tools and techniques such as log analysis software and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to automate and enhance the review process.

5. **Implement Response Procedures:**
   - Develop and document response procedures for handling alerts and incidents detected through the network traffic flow logs. Ensure that the incident response team is trained and prepared to act quickly and effectively when an alert is triggered.

6. **Ensure Compliance and Security:**
   - Ensure that the collection and storage of network traffic flow logs comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Implement appropriate security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the logs, such as encryption and access controls.

By following these procedures, an organization can effectively implement CIS Control 13.6, enhancing its ability to detect and respond to potential security threats and ensuring the overall security and compliance of its network.
