### Version
2.6.8
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/54v49n1nzn
### Steps to reproduce
The repro shows the issue directly.
### What is expected?
I wanted to know what takes precedence when something is bound using
`v-bind={}` vs set explicitly as a prop. I would expect this to always be one
or the other, or to be resolved in order of declaration as when merging
objects in JS ({...boundProps, specificProp })
### What is actually happening?
The precedence is determined based on whether a prop has multiple words.
duplicate keys are set by the object when they are declared in dash-case, and
set by the prop/attribute if they are camelCase or a single word.
* * *
This can be made 'consistent' by declaring multiword props using camelcase,
but that's against the recommendations in the styleguide which suggest using
dash case for multiword props inside templates: https://vuejs.org/v2/style-
guide/#Prop-name-casing-strongly-recommended.
I ran into this when an undefined value bound to a parent was overriding the
same value explicitly set in the child, but it wasn't happening consistently
depending on what the names of the props were.
