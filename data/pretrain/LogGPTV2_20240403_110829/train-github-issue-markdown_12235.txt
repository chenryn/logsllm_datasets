This could be considered a bug or a feature request. I say this because I know
that React is checking for W3C valid attribute property names, but the check
is run inconsistently between normal components and custom components which
makes its behavior confusing. That means this could be feature to be more
explicit about its behavior.
For my particular use case, this only needs to be improved upon in `react-
dom/server`. I am trying to render custom properties like those belonging to
`amphtml`, particularly the `amp-bind` API which requires `[` and `]` in
property names. I think that the check for valid attribute property names
should only throw warnings, or it should have an option to prevent the removal
of custom properties.
Example:
  * JS
        const customProps = {
      "[custom-property]": "Hello, world!"
    };
  * JSX
      Test
      Test
  * Resulting HTML
      Test
      Test
This throws a warning only for the ``.
