User: How to create and start an ECS cluster using a CloudFormation template in an AWS environment?
Assistant: The steps to create and start an ECS cluster using a CloudFormation template are as follows: 1. Log in to the AWS management console and open the CloudFormation service page. 2. On the "Create stack" page, select "Create by template and parameters", upload the CloudFormation template file of the ECS cluster, and click "Next". 3. On the Specify Stack Details page, enter a name and parameter values for the stack. 4. On the Configure Stack Options page, you can directly click Next without adding a label. 5. On the "Review" page, check "I acknowledge that this template may create IAM resources in my AWS account", and then click "Create Stack". 6. Wait for a few minutes, and CloudFormation starts to execute the template file. ECS clusters including ECS services, ECR warehouses, ALB load balancers and other resources will be created and run. 7. After the stack is created, the docker container hosted by the ECS service can be called externally.
