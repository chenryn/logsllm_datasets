To create and start an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster using a CloudFormation template in your AWS environment, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Access the AWS Management Console**: Log in to your AWS account and navigate to the CloudFormation service page.

2. **Initiate Stack Creation**:
   - Click on the "Create stack" button.
   - Choose the option "With new resources (standard)".
   - Select "Upload a template file" and browse to upload your prepared CloudFormation template that specifies the ECS cluster configuration. Then, click "Next".

3. **Specify Stack Details**:
   - Provide a unique name for your stack.
   - Fill in any required parameter values as defined in your CloudFormation template. These might include details such as instance types, security group settings, or desired capacity. After completing this, proceed by clicking "Next".

4. **Configure Stack Options** (Optional):
   - You may add tags to your stack for better organization or leave it blank if not needed. Additionally, you can set up advanced options like rollback configurations. Once done, click "Next" to move forward.

5. **Review Your Stack Configuration**:
   - Carefully review all the information entered so far.
   - At the bottom of the page, check the box next to "I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names."
   - Finally, click "Create stack" to initiate the deployment process.

6. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - The creation process will take several minutes. During this time, CloudFormation will provision all specified resources, including the ECS cluster, associated services, ECR repositories, Application Load Balancers (ALBs), and other related components.
   - Monitor the progress via the CloudFormation dashboard until the status changes to "CREATE_COMPLETE", indicating successful deployment.

7. **External Access to Docker Containers**:
   - Once the stack is fully created, the Docker containers hosted within the ECS service should be accessible from external networks, provided the appropriate networking and security rules have been configured in your CloudFormation template.

By following these steps, you'll successfully deploy an ECS cluster along with its supporting infrastructure through AWS CloudFormation, enabling efficient container management and orchestration.
