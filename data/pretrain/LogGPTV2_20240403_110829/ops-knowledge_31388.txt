User: Give an example configuration file of Nginx reverse proxy, and explain the role of each part.
Assistant: The following is an example of a common Nginx reverse proxy configuration file: ``` worker_processes 4; events { worker_connections 1024; } http { upstream backend_servers { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; } server { listen 80 ; server_name www.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend_servers; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } } ``` The configuration file is divided into three parts: event, HTTP and server blocks. The following is a detailed explanation of each part: ## Events ``` events { worker_connections 1024; } The ``` event section defines how Nginx handles connections and requests. The example above uses the default event model and sets the number of connections each worker process can handle to 1024. You may need to increase this number if you have a large number of connection requests. ## HTTP ``` http { upstream backend_servers { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; } server { listen 80; server_name www.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend_servers; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } } ``` The HTTP section contains a collection of blocks describing how to handle HTTP requests. The above example defines an upstream service named `backend_servers` which contains two backend servers `backend1.example.com` and `backend2.example.com`. ## server block ``` server { listen 80; server_name www.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend_servers; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` server block Describes how to configure Nginx to handle incoming requests. The above example defines a server block called `www.example.com`, which listens on port 80 for incoming requests. Requests are forwarded to backend servers in the `backend_servers` upstream service via the `location/` directive. The `proxy_set_header` directive is used to set request header information. The `$host` variable represents the HTTP host header of the request, and the `$remote_addr` variable represents the client IP address. The `proxy_pass` directive is used to forward requests to backend servers in upstream services. In this example, the request will be forwarded to one of the backend servers in the `backend_servers` upstream service.
