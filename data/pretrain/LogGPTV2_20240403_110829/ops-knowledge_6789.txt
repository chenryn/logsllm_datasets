User: You need to deploy a containerized application into production, what software do you need to install and how to configure it?
Assistant: First, you need to make sure your production environment has Docker and Docker Compose installed. You then need to configure a Docker image repository to hold your container images and manage them. You also need to configure some environment variables for your application, such as database connection settings, port numbers, etc. For better container management, you may also want to use container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to automatically deploy and manage containers. You need to set up the network and security configuration in production to ensure that your application can run in a secure environment. Finally, you need to configure the continuous integration and deployment process to ensure that your application can be automatically deployed to production after modification, so that you can quickly respond to user needs and errors.
