reports have shown that this abusive design of the GFW can
lead to resource exhaustion attacks on speciﬁc IPs, making
them inaccessible [34, 54, 64].
To estimate the extent to which the above geoblocking
and overblocking policies have impacted the global Inter-
net, we analyze the location of authoritative name servers of
138.7K base censored domains and 41K innocuously blocked
domains, using the MaxMind dataset [7]. As shown in Fig-
ure 10, 38% (53K) of the base censored domains and 21.6%
(8.8K) of the innocuous censored domains have at least one
authoritative name server in China. In other words, there is
always a non-zero chance that DNS resolution for these 61.8K
domains from outside China will be poisoned, causing their
visitors to potentially end up with an error page similar to
the above case. On the other hand, 19.4% (26.9K) of base
censored domains and 12.5% (5.1K) innocuously blocked
domains have all of their authoritative name servers in China,
meaning that the resolutions for these 32K domains from out-
side China will always cross the GFW, thus being poisoned.
6.2 Detection
A common operational mechanism of DNS censorship is
that the censor takes advantage of the time-honored property
of UDP-based DNS resolution to inject poisoned responses,
racing against the legitimate response. Depending on the
censored domain being queried, the GFW can even emit up
to three responses. This behavior of injecting multiple fake
responses was ﬁrst reported recently in [21]. For the complete-
ness of our investigation, we have also identiﬁed the three
different injectors based on the data collected by GFWatch,
with more detailed analysis in Appendix C.
From the GFW’s perspective, the injection of multiple fake
responses not only increases the chance of successfully poi-
soning a censored client but also makes it more costly and
challenging to detect and circumvent its DNS censorship [40].
However, based on the pool of forged IPs and their injection
patterns that we have revealed in §5, detecting DNS censor-
ship by the GFW can be done effectively by checking the
returned IP address against the pool of forged IPs discovered
by GFWatch. Although this strategy may not detect all poi-
soned responses due to some rare forged IPs that GFWatch
might have not observed in the long tail, from the analysis of
injection frequency in §5.2, which we have also veriﬁed its
consistency across different network locations (Appendix B),
we are conﬁdent that this detection technique can identify
more than 99% of the poisoned responses.
We next employ this detection technique to expose poi-
soned resource records that have tainted public DNS resolvers
around the world. In particular, once a censored domain is
detected by GFWatch, we query them against popular DNS
resolvers and examine if its response matches any injection
pattern we have revealed in §5. Table 2 shows the top ten
resolvers that have been polluted with the highest number of
censored domains. In total, we ﬁnd 77K censored domains
whose poisoned resource records have polluted the cache of
all popular public DNS resolvers that we examined. Of these
censored domains, 61K are base censored domains. This re-
sult aligns well with our earlier speculation in §6.1.
This ﬁnding shows the widespread impact of the bidirec-
tional blocking behavior of the GFW, necessitating the op-
erators of these public DNS resolvers to have an effective
and efﬁcient mechanism to prevent these poisoned resource
records from polluting their cache, to assure the quality of
their DNS service. Furthermore, the 61K base censored do-
mains whose DNS queries from outside China are censored is
likely the reason why many censored domains are classiﬁed
as “newly observed domain” or “not rated” in §4.2. This
is because FortiGuard’s crawlers, which are likely located
outside China, probably could not obtain the correct IPs of
these domains, thus failing to fetch and classify them.

We now show how insights gained from analyzing the cen-
sored domains (§4) and forged IPs discovered by GFWatch
over time (§5) can assist us in developing strategies to effec-
tively and efﬁciently circumvent GFW’s DNS censorship.
7.1 Strategy
The GFW’s bidirectional DNS ﬁltering not only impacts in-
China users but also prevents users outside China from obtain-
ing legitimate resources records of geographically restricted
domains based in China (§6.1). Therefore, an effective DNS
censorship evasion strategy would beneﬁt not only (1) users
inside China who need to access censored domains hosted
outside China, but also (2) users outside China who need ac-
cess to geoblocked domains based in China. Both (1) and (2)
also include open DNS resolvers located at both sides of the
GFW that want to prevent poisoned responses from polluting
their DNS cache.
Since the GFW operates as an on-path injector and does
not alter the legitimate response from the actual DNS resolver
chosen by a client, a circumvention strategy for the client
is to not quickly accept any returned responses when query-
ing a censored domain. Instead, the client should wait for
an adjustable amount of time for all responses to arrive, as
suggested in [40]. Upon receiving more than one IPv6 an-
swer, the client can ﬁlter out the bogus ones that belong to the
Teredo subnet 2001::/32. Furthermore, for IPv4 answers,
the client can check them against the injection patterns and
forged IPv4 addresses discovered in §5.
In our circumvention strategy, for each censored domain we
need at least a trustworthy resolver that possesses its genuine
resource record(s). Popular open resolvers (e.g., 8.8.8.8,
1.1.1.1) are often considered as trustworthy sources when
it comes to censorship evasion. However, we have shown
that the vast majority of public DNS resolvers have been
polluted with poisoned resource records (§6.2). Therefore,
we opt not to use them in this case, especially for obtaining
the legitimate resource records of geoblocked domains based
in China. The only remaining source that is immune to the
GFW’s poisoned responses and has a given censored domain’s
genuine resource record(s) is its authoritative name servers.
This information is available in the zone ﬁles.
We send DNS queries for 138.7K base censored domains
and 41K innocuous domains to their authoritative name
servers from our controlled machines located at both sides
of the GFW. We then expect to observe both censored and
non-censored resolutions at two sides of the GFW as a result
of this experiment. More speciﬁcally, from our US machine,
resolutions for domains whose authoritative name servers are
located outside China will not be censored as their queries will
not cross the GFW, whereas resolutions for domains whose
authoritative name servers are located inside China are ex-
pected to be censored. On the contrary, resolutions from our
China machine towards authoritative name servers located
inside China will not be censored, while those queries sent to
authoritative name servers outside China will.
7.2 Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we apply the pro-
posed circumvention strategy to ﬁlter out poisoned responses
for those censored resolutions and retain their “legitimate”
responses, which we then compare with actual legitimate re-
sponses returned from non-censored resolutions conducted
at the other side of the GFW. We ﬁnd that our circumvention
strategy is highly effective, with an accuracy rate of 99.8%.
That is, 99.8% of responses classiﬁed as “legitimate” match
the actual legitimate responses obtained from non-censored
resolutions. From a total of 1,007,002,451 resolutions that the
GFW poisons, 1,005,444,476 responses classiﬁed as “legiti-
mate” by our strategy contain the same resource records (i.e.,
same IPs, CNAMEs, or IPs under the same AS for domains
hosted on Content Delivery Networks) with those observed
from non-censored resolutions. As discussed in §5.2, there
are a small number of cases that we could not classify due to
the invisibility of those rarely injected forged IPs in the long
tail that GFWatch did not observe. This ﬁnding highlights
the importance of having an up-to-date and continuous view
into the pool of forged IPs for effectively circumventing the
GFW’s DNS censorship.
To further assist in future adoptions of our strategy so that
it will not signiﬁcantly downgrade the normal performance of
other UDP-based DNS resolutions for non-censored domains,
we analyze the hold-on duration, which the client should wait
only when resolving a censored domain, instead of holding
on for every resolution.
Figure 11 shows the cumulative distribution of the delta
time between the ﬁrst forged response and the legitimate one.
The (red) dash line is the CDF of the delta time measured at
our China machine, and the (blue) solid line is the CDF of
this delta time measured at our US machine. On the x-axis, a
positive value means a poisoned response arrives before the
legitimate one. In contrast, a negative value indicates that the
legitimate response has arrived ahead of the fake ones.
As shown in the ﬁgure, the GFW can successfully poi-
son more than 99.9% of all resolutions that carry censored
domains, performed from our China machine towards author-
itative name servers located outside China. 99% of poisoned
responses hit our machine within 364ms ahead of the legit-
imate ones. Although this delta time may vary, depending
on the relative distance between the client and the GFW, for
any client whose network location is close to ours, this is
the amount of extra time they should wait when resolving a
censored domain from inside China. In other words, upon re-
ceiving a DNS response after querying a censored domain, the
client should wait, at most, an extra 364ms for the legitimate

resource records shown in Table 3 should be viewed as an
upper bound of the actual number of domains that are actively
hosting any content or service. As part of our future work,
we plan to visit all of these domains using their true resource
records and further investigate the contents hosted on them.
Another focal point of Table 3 is the signiﬁcantly high
number of CNAME resource records of both base censored
domains and innocuously blocked domains that have at least
one authoritative name server located in China, compared to
domains whose authoritative name servers are located outside
China. As far as we are aware, this is because of a common
workaround that is widely suggested and used by domain
owners who want to serve their websites to users at both sides
of the GFW since these CNAMEs are not ﬁltered by the GFW.
8 Discussion
In this section, we discuss the limitations of our study and
provide suggestions for involving parties that are impacted by
the GFW’s DNS censorship.
8.1 Limitations
In order to compare our analysis on the categories of cen-
sored domains with prior studies, we choose to use a common
classiﬁcation service provided by FortiGuard [4]. However,
we discovered that the GFW’s overblocking and geoblock-
ing policy could have already impacted this service (§6.2).
Moreover, Vallina et al. [89] have shown that different classi-
ﬁcation services could result in different views of the domains
being categorized. We thus tried to obtain additional classi-
ﬁcation services from two other vendors, namely, McAfee
and VirusTotal. However, we were told by McAfee [8] that
they only provide the service for business customers, and
VirusTotal [17] did not respond to our requests.
Similar to other studies in remote censorship measure-
ment [78, 79, 90], packets sent from our measurement in-
frastructure may get blocked or discriminated by the GFW.
However, over the course of more than nine months operating
GFWatch, we did not experience any disruptions caused by
such discriminative behaviors, as is evident by the consistency
observed between the data collected by GFWatch and across
different network locations (Appendix B). Moreover, as part
of our outreach activities, we have also received conﬁrmations
from local Chinese advocacy groups and owners of censored

responses measured from CN and US controlled machines.
one to arrive. Users at different locations can heuristically
probe known censored domains to estimate the hold-on dura-
tion that is representative for their location.
From the GFW’s perspective, forged responses should ide-
ally arrive at the client before the legitimate one. From our US
machine, we ﬁnd that this is not always true. Due to the unreli-
able and stateless nature of UDP packets that might get lost or
delayed when transferred between two distant locations, and
perhaps poisoning users outside China is not the primary de-
sign goal of the GFW, 11% of the poisoned responses arrive
at our US machine after the legitimate ones. Nevertheless,
the remaining 89% of fake responses still hit our machine
within 94ms ahead of the legitimate ones. This result again
highlights the importance of having a representative dataset
of forged IPs used by the GFW to effectively circumvent its
DNS censorship. Especially when fake responses arrive later,
