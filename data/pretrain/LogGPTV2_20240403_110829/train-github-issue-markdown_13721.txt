**Benoit Heurter** opened **SPR-3640** and commented
Method buildTypedStringValueForMap of class BeanDefinitionParserDelegate is
private. Because of that, i cannot create a sub-class of
BeanDefinitionParserDelegate with my slightly modified version of
parseMapElement method.
It's not blocker as i duplicated whole te code but it seems easier if i could
re-use original methods
Could you please change methods below to protected ?
buildTypedStringValueForMap  
buildTypedStringValue
Thank you in advance
