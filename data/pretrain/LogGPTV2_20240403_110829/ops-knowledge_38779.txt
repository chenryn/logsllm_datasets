User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题RDS Logon failure with domain accounts over internet, but not over VPN We have a domain-joined RDS 2008 R2 server where logons are rejected for domain accounts (even domain admins) coming in directly over the internet, but it works fine over VPN or internally.

The RDS server also has a number of local accounts, and those logons work fine directly over the internet or over VPN. The domain is controlled by SBS 2003.

Some configuration and locking down was done long ago on this server, so I'm not sure if this is due to some configuration or it's a Windows issue.

I don't think it is a Windows or hardware firewall issue, since the attempted RDP logon reaches the server.  The failed logon is recorded in the Event Viewer:

        An account failed to log on.

All the single dashes above are verbatim from the log entry, I did not insert them for privacy.

Assistant: It turns out this issue is due to KB3002657 and KB3046049:

I uninstalled KB3046049 and the problem went away for a few weeks.  Recently the problem returned, so I uninstalled KB3002657 and the problem went away again.  Hopefully it will stay that way this time.
