### Safety of the Tor Network: An Analysis of Network Diversity, Relay Operators, and Malicious Relays

**Speaker: Runa A. Sandvik**
- Developer for the Tor Project
- Involved with Tor since Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2009
- Frequent traveler

#### Overview of the Talk
This presentation will address the following questions:
- Is the Tor network a CIA honeypot?
- Are all relays malicious?

The analysis is based on consensus files created between late 2007 and mid-2013.

| Year | Number of Relays |
|------|------------------|
| 2008 | 0                |
| 2009 | 1000             |
| 2010 | 2000             |
| 2011 | 3000             |
| 2012 | 3000             |
| 2013 | 3000             |

#### High-Level Statistics
- **Unique Nicknames:** 95,314
- **Unique IP Addresses:** 1,595,879
- **Unique Fingerprints:** 230,595
- **Countries Represented:** 195

#### Top Countries
- United States
- Germany
- France
- Russia
- Netherlands
- United Kingdom

#### Popular Nicknames
- Unnamed, default, ididnteditheconfig, idideditheconfig, MgeniUser, anonymous
- Note: "anonymous" (Germany, Sweden, US, Ukraine) vs. "Anonymous" (US, Germany, Ukraine, Japan)
- Many Orbot relays in the Middle East

#### Average Metrics
- **Uptime**
- **Lifetime**
- **Bandwidth**
- **Utilization**

#### Challenges and Concerns
- **China and Russia:** Known for their restrictive internet policies.
- **Eastern European Botnet:** Potential threat to the network's integrity.

#### Network Diversity
- **Diverse Ownership:** Different relays are owned by different people.
- **Geographic Distribution:** Relays are located in various data centers around the world.

#### Number of Relays with Assigned Flags

| Month   | Number of Relays with Flags |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| May 2013| 0                           |
| Jun 2013| 1000                        |
| Jul 2013| 2000                        |

#### Relay Flags
- **Running**
- **Exit**
- **Guard**
- **Fast**
- **Stable**

#### Malicious Relays
- **SSL Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
- **sslstrip Tool**
- **Plaintext Only Exit Policy**
- **Anti-Virus Filters Blocking Sites**
- **Dropping TLS Connections for Multiple Sites**

#### Snakes on a Tor (SoaT)
- **Purpose:** Scans the Tor network for misbehaving and misconfigured exit relays.
- **Tests:** HTML, JavaScript, arbitrary HTTP, SSL, DNS scans.
- **Status:** Several relays have been banned since 2010, but SoaT is currently not maintained.

#### Banning a Relay
- **BadExit Flag:** Set by directory authorities.
- **Statistics:** 36,356 unique IP addresses tied to 264 unique nicknames with the BadExit flag.

#### Future Directions
- How can we further improve the safety and diversity of the Tor network?
