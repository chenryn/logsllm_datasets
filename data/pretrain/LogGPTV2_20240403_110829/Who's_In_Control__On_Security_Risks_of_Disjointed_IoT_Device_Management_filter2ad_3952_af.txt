### Coordination and Synchronization of Security Policies

Even devices from the same manufacturer often lack proper synchronization in their security policies. Our investigation into HomeKit revealed that it operates through two channels: a local channel, which directly connects an iPhone (via the Home app) to the IoT device, and a cloud-based channel, where commands from the Home app are routed through the HomeKit cloud to reach the IoT device. When these two channels have conflicting security policies, there is no established protocol to resolve the issue, leading to potential privilege escalation attacks (see Flaw 6 in Appendix C).

### Clean Slate Design for Addressing Codema Risk

To fundamentally address the Codema risk, we propose a clean-slate design with a cross-DMC (Device Management Channel) management standard. This standard would allow different DMCs to work together, ensuring consistent and fine-grained device control. We outline two key principles for designing and implementing this standard:

1. **Multi-layered and Coordinated Authorization**:
   - A primary cause of Codema is the independent operation of today's DMCs, each having the same control rights over a device. This can be mitigated by implementing multi-level security, where some DMCs (such as m-DMC) are granted higher privileges than others. This approach enables better coordination of policy configurations across different channels, resolving conflicts and providing comprehensive protection under the command of the authorized party, typically the device owner.

2. **Standardized Middleware and Interfaces**:
   - The heterogeneity of DMC architectures (e.g., with or without cloud support) and technical stacks (e.g., HAP, Zigbee, Z-Wave) complicates the configuration and enforcement of security policies. Therefore, it is essential to develop standardized middleware to ensure compatibility and interoperability among different DMCs. Additionally, defining standardized software interfaces and protocols for DMC developers will facilitate the exchange of user information and access control policies.

### Mitigation Strategies Observed

After reporting Codema vulnerabilities to affected vendors, some have implemented mitigation measures. However, these measures often lack a systematic approach like CGuard, resulting in ad-hoc, less usable, and less secure solutions. For example, August now disables all third-party DMCs by default, requiring device owners to use the m-DMC (August app) to enable or disable third-party DMCs. When the owner removes other or guest users via the August app, a warning is displayed to communicate the Codema risks: "The removed user may still have access via HomeKit." Compared to CGuard, this solution does not meet the U-Goal (user-friendly goal) as it forces the owner to use the m-DMC first. Furthermore, its cross-DMC control (enabling/disabling HomeKit) is only available on August’s iOS app, which is subject to Codema Flaw 3.

Another example is the MiHome lamp, where the m-DMC is automatically disabled once the user fully configures the lamp with HomeKit DMC. This partially adheres to the fail-safe default principle but leaves the HomeKit DMC open if the owner opts for the m-DMC, allowing adversaries to bind and control the device. After our Codema report, LIFX enhanced their protection by updating the LIFX iOS app to force users to take control of both HomeKit and LIFX’s m-DMC during setup, protecting those using the LIFX iOS app. However, iOS users who choose to use the Apple Home app and all Android users remain at risk.

### Scalable Detection of Codema Flaws

Our current method for detecting Codema flaws (Section 3) has limitations in identifying dependencies between state transitions of two DMCs, as it relies on manual efforts to set up individual DMCs and confirm whether fully configuring one DMC depends on any operation or approval in another DMC (e.g., configuring HomeKit DMC in the Abode Alarm Hub requires a setup code generated in the m-DMC’s app, see Figure 6). Automating this process is challenging due to the need for manual steps such as scanning setup codes or performing device-specific physical operations. To scale our work and enable large-scale assessment of Codema flaws involving more devices, we propose building an improved approach on our current model-guided method by automating the model-building process. Specifically, we can extract the model of each DMC on a device by analyzing the semantic-based UI of the DMC mobile apps, particularly identifying whether the setup process of a DMC involves a step in another DMC.

### Related Work

#### IoT Platform Security
Many studies have analyzed the security of IoT platforms. For instance, [51] provided a methodology to evaluate security properties for home-based IoT devices from the perspectives of attack techniques, mitigations, and stakeholders. [54, 55, 57, 58, 65, 68, 70] presented methods to detect inter-rule vulnerabilities, misbehaving devices, malicious apps, and security policy violations. [71] and [56] identified problematic device management in IoT clouds based on state machine models of single devices. [69] studied the IoT cross-cloud delegation process. In contrast, our work focuses on understanding and revealing the security risks associated with multiple coexisting DMCs on the same device, rather than identifying flaws in a single DMC or platform.

#### IoT Access Control
Access control in today’s IoT ecosystem is distributed, heterogeneous, and ad-hoc. To address these challenges, [53] introduced WAVE, a decentralized authorization framework that supports decentralized verification, transitive delegation, and revocation. [60] proposed Decentralized Action Integrity to prevent untrusted IoT platforms from misusing OAuth tokens. [67] presented a user-centered authorization mechanism to protect users from overprivileged apps in Samsung SmartThings, while [63] proposed a fine-grained context-based access control system for the same platform. [66] introduced “environmental situational oracles” to avoid over-privilege, redundancy, inconsistency, and inflexibility in IoT situational access control. Our work, however, aims to fix the access control problem caused by Codema, a new and unexplored issue, by developing CGuard, a technique that can be unilaterally implemented by device manufacturers to fully mediate third-party DMCs without altering their designs.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first systematic study on the security risks introduced by the presence of multiple DMCs on IoT devices. The lack of coordination among these DMCs exposes a new attack surface, allowing unauthorized parties to bypass the protection enforced by one channel through another. Our study shows that this security weakness is pervasive and fundamental. User studies and measurement analysis further demonstrate that the security risk is realistic and significant. To mitigate this risk, we introduced a new access control framework that enables IoT manufacturers to unilaterally control the accessibility status of third-party channels. Our evaluation provides evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and feasibility of the design.
