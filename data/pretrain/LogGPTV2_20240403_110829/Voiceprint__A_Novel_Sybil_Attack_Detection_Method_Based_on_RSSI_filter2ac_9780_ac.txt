Observation 3: Similar patterns of RSSI time series.
The RSSI time series of the malicious node and the Sybil
nodes have very similar patterns. The series of the malicious
node and the normal node 2 are similar, but still have some
differences even if they always keep very close distance (2.75-
3.25m) during the motion.

Assumption 1: We assume there may be several Sybil
attackers in VANETs, but
those malicious nodes do not
collude to launch Sybil attacks. The attacker only creates new
identities rather than stealing other vehicle’s identity.
Assumption 2: In VANETs, every vehicle is equipped with
only one DSRC radio and one 5.9GHz antenna that is able to
broadcast its own information on CCH periodically. The OBUs
may have heterogeneous conﬁgurations, but their broadcast
frequency is constant (10Hz) according to the DSRC protocol.
That means the malicious node will simulate and broadcast all
Sybil nodes’ information with the same frequency on CCH.
Assumption 3: Unlike most previous works consider the
same transmission power for each node, we relax this as-
sumption and allow different
transmission power settings.
The normal nodes may have different default TX Power
settings or different antenna gains (heterogeneous OBUs). The
malicious node may increase or decrease initial TX Power for
each fabricated Sybil node. However, the TX Power remains
constant during the transmission.

B. Similarity Measures for Time Series
Fig. 7: RSSI time series recorded by the normal node 3
With this observation, we proposed the Voiceprint method
to transfer the Sybil attack detection into comparing the
similarity between two time series which is like to recognize
and differentiate the vehicular speech.
IV. THE PROPOSED SCHEME VOICEPRINT
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the attack model and
assumptions. Then, we introduce the similarity measures for
time series. Finally, we give the detailed Sybil attack detection
algorithm based on vehicular voiceprint.
A. Attack Model and Assumptions
In this paper, we focus on the simultaneous Sybil attack
that each Sybil attacker concurrently creates multiple fake
identities to disrupt normal functionalities of VANETs. Figure
8 shows a typical Sybil attack scenario in the highway envi-
ronment. From this ﬁgure, the legitimate vehicle bounded with
unique valid identity is referring to the normal node (marked
in blue). The physical vehicle uses multiple forged identities
is called malicious node (marked in yellow), and the claimed
virtual identities are Sybil nodes (marked in red).
Time series is a sequence of data points successively collect-
ed over time. With the Observation 3 obtained from the real-
world experiments, we ﬁnd that the RSSI time series of Sybil
nodes have very similar patterns. Therefore, we detect Sybil
attack by measuring the similarity between two RSSI time
series based on this important observation. Here, similarity
is an absolute value computed by comparing or matching the
resemblances between two series. Commonly, a distance func-
tion D(X, Y ) is deﬁned to represent the similarity between
time series X and Y .
Since time series similarity measures have been a major
topic in data mining research for decades, many distance
functions have been proposed in this domain. The classical
form to compute the similarity is Lp norm as follows:
(cid:5)
N(cid:6)
(cid:7) 1
p
DLp (X, Y ) =
(xi − yi)p
(2)
1
where p is a positive integer, N is the length of two time
series, xi and yi are the ith element of time series of X and
Y , respectively. When p equals to 2, it is the well-known
Euclidean distance.
Another commonly used distance is called Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW). DTW adopts dynamic programming tech-
nique to determine the best matching between two time series
by warping the series in the temporal domain. Given two time
series with different length N and M, XN (x1, x2, ...xi, ...xN )
and YM (y1, y2, ...yj, ...yM ), DTW ﬁrst establishes an N-by-
M cost matrix C containing distance ci,j between each pair
of points xi and yj. The cost ci,j is usually used Euclidean
distance as:
ci,j= (xi − yi)2

Then, DTW computes the minimum accumulated cost Di,j
for each pairwise matching (i, j) between two series recur-
sively by:
596

Di,j=ci,j + min{Di−1,j, Di,j−1, Di−1,j−1}
(4)
where D0,0 is set to be 0 initially and other value in the
accumulated cost matrix D are initialized to ∞.
After that, DTW constructs a optimal warp path W =
w1, w2, ..wk, ...wK (wk = (i, j) means the ith element of
X is matched to the jth element of Y ) with the minimum
total accumulated cost. The optimal warp path W must start
from w1 = (1, 1) to wK = (N, M ) to ensure all points of
both series are matched. In addition, the warp path should
also satisfy the monotonicity constraints which is deﬁned as:
IF wk= (i, j) , wk+1= (i
T HEN i ≤ i
(cid:2)) ;
, j
(cid:2) ≤ i + 1, j ≤ j
(cid:2) ≤ j + 1
(cid:2)
(5)
Finally, the DTW distance is measured as the total accumu-
lated cost:
the point-to-point way, which requires two time series having
the same length. DTW distance overcomes this limitation that
can tolerate the shifting, scaling and warping of series in the
temporal domain, which is widely used in speech recognition
to cope with different speeking speeds. Considering that packet
loss often occurs in VANETs, we cannot always get
two
RSSI series with exactly the same length. Therefore, we use
DTW distance to measure the similarity of RSSI time series
like vehicular voiceprint recognition. However, despite the
accuracy of DTW scheme, it has O(N 2) time complexity in
general since it should ﬁll all cells in the NM cost matrix.
So, we adopt FastDTW [24] in this paper. FastDTW speeds
up DTW distance measure by adding constraints and data
abstraction to limit the cost cell evaluation. Then, it achieves
O(N ) time complexity while has only 1% loss of accuracy,
which can meet requirements of the Sybil attack detection.

C. Proposed Detection Methodology
Here we give a simple example to illustrate how to compute
the DTW distance as shown in Figure 9. The two time series
are X = {1, 1, 4, 1, 1} and Y = {2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2} with total
length of N = 5 and M = 6 respectively. The DTW distance
is measured as 9 in this case.
Wang et al. make an extensive comparison for 13 different
similarity measures using 38 data sets from various application
domains [23]. The main conclusion drawn by the study is that
the DTW distance is superior to the other newly proposed
methods considering the accuracy in the vast majority of
cases, and the well-established Euclidean distance is also
a robust, simple, generic and efﬁcient way to measure the
similarity of time series. From above introduction of these
two distances, we ﬁnd that the Euclidean distance matches in

In this subsection, we present our Sybil attack detection
method, Voiceprint, based on similarity measuring of RSSI
time series. Voiceprint does not rely on any predeﬁned radio
propagation model, and it also does not require the support
of centralized infrastructures (RSUs or base stations). Each
vehicle conducts independent detection locally without estab-
lishing trust relationship among neighboring vehicles.
There are three phases in Voiceprint, collection, comparison
and conﬁrmation.
1) Collection: According to Assumption 2, each vehicle
mounts a DSRC compliant OBU to broadcast its basic infor-
mation periodically on CCH. Generally, the basic information
includes vehicle’s identity,
location, velocity, acceleration,
direction and etc. Vehicles exchange the information from each
other for safety-related applications. All neighboring nodes
could receive these messages and measure the RSSI value for
each successfully received packet. In the collection phase, one
vehicle monitors the CCH and records all the latest messages
within a constant interval (this interval is called observation
time in this paper). Actually, for each packet, Voiceprint only
needs to store a 2-tuple , and then generates
RSSI time series for each received IDs. Here, RSSI time series
of vehicle i is denoted by RSSIi.
2) Comparison: After a sufﬁcient observation time for
collection, each vehicle has enough data to make comparison
between every pair wise RSSI time series. As aforementioned,
we use DTW distance to measure the similarity of RSSI time
series. However, based on Assumption 3, if the malicious
node deliberately increase or decrease the initial TX Power for
different Sybil nodes, the similarity of RSSI time series among
malicious node and Sybil nodes can be simply broken, because
the relative distance between each aligned points is enlarged.
To solve this problem, we conduct a data preprocessing before
the comparison which normalizes every RSSI time series by
an enhanced Z-score normalization:
