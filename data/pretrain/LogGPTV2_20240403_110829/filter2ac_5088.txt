titleblackhat:us-18 Threat Modeling in 2018: Attacks, Impacts and Other Updates
Attacks always get better, and that means your threat modeling needs to evolve.  This talk looks at what's new and important in threat modeling, organizes it into a simple conceptual framework, and makes it actionable.  This includes new properties of systems being attacked, new attack techniques (like biometrics confused by LEDs) and a growing importance of threats to and/or through social media platforms and features.  Take home ways to ensure your security engineering and threat modeling practices are up-to-date.
