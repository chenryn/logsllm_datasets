# Create an Event Grid data connection for Azure Data Explorer
In this article, you learn how to ingest blobs from your storage account into Azure Data Explorer using an Event Grid data connection. You'll create an Event Grid data connection that sets an [Azure Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/overview) subscription. The Event Grid subscription routes events from your storage account to Azure Data Explorer via an Azure Event Hubs.
[!INCLUDE [ingestion-size-limit](includes/ingestion-size-limit.md)]
To learn how to create the connection using the Kusto SDKs, see [Create an Event Grid data connection with SDKs](create-event-grid-connection-sdk.md).
For general information about ingesting into Azure Data Explorer from Event Grid, see [Connect to Event Grid](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md).
> [!NOTE]
> To achieve the best performance with the Event Grid connection, set the `rawSizeBytes` ingestion property via the blob metadata. For more information, see [ingestion properties](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md#ingestion-properties).
## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* An Azure Data Explorer cluster and database. [Create a cluster and database](create-cluster-and-database.md).
* A destination table. [Create a table](kusto/management/create-table-command.md) or use an existing table.
* An [ingestion mapping](kusto/management/mappings.md) for the table.
* A [storage account](/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal). An Event Grid notification subscription can be set on Azure Storage accounts for `BlobStorage`, `StorageV2`, or [Data Lake Storage Gen2](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction).
* Have the [Event Grid resource provider registered](/azure/event-grid/blob-event-quickstart-portal#register-the-event-grid-resource-provider).
## Create an Event Grid data connection
In this section, you'll establish a connection between Event Grid and your Azure Data Explorer table.
### [Portal - Azure Data Explorer](#tab/portal-adx)
1. Under the cluster you created, select **Databases** > **TestDatabase**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/ingest-data-event-grid/select-test-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Databases page, showing a database.":::
1. Select **Data ingestion** > **Add data connection**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/ingest-data-event-grid/data-ingestion-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data ingestion page, showing the add data connection option.":::
1. Under **Basics**, select the connection type: **Blob storage** and then fill out the form with the following information:
    :::image type="content" source="media/ingest-data-event-grid/data-connection-basics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Data Connection Basics tab, showing the options for the Blob storage connection type.":::
    |**Setting** | **Suggested value** | **Field description**|
    |---|---|---|
    | Data connection name | *test-grid-connection* | The name of the connection that you want to create in Azure Data Explorer.|
    | Storage account subscription | Your subscription ID | The subscription ID where your storage account is.|
    | Storage account | *gridteststorage1* | The name of the storage account that you created previously.|
    | Event type | *Blob created* or *Blob renamed* | The type of event that triggers ingestion. *Blob renamed* is supported only for ADLSv2 storage. To rename a blob, navigate to the blob in Azure portal, right-click on the blob and select **Rename**. Supported types are: Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated or Microsoft.Storage.BlobRenamed. |
    | Resources creation | *Automatic* | Define whether you want Azure Data Explorer to create an Event Grid Subscription, an Event Hubs namespace, and an Event Hubs for you. To create resources manually, see [Manually create resources for Event Grid ingestion](ingest-data-event-grid-manual.md)|
1. Select **Filter settings** if you want to track specific subjects. Set the filters for the notifications as follows:
    * **Prefix** field is the *literal* prefix of the subject. As the pattern applied is *starts with*, it can span multiple containers, folders, or blobs. No wildcards are allowed.
        * To define a filter on the blob container, the field *must* be set as follows: *`/blobServices/default/containers/[container prefix]`*.
        * To define a filter on a blob prefix (or a folder in Azure Data Lake Gen2), the field *must* be set as follows: *`/blobServices/default/containers/[container name]/blobs/[folder/blob prefix]`*.
    * **Suffix** field is the *literal* suffix of the blob. No wildcards are allowed.
    * **Case-Sensitive** field indicates whether the prefix and suffix filters are case-sensitive
    * For more information about filtering events, see [Blob storage events](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview#filtering-events).

    |---|---|---|
    | Allow routing the data to other databases (Multi database data connection) | Don't allow | Turn on this option if you want to override the default target database associated with the data connection. For more information about database routing, see [Events routing](ingest-data-event-grid-overview.md#events-routing). |
