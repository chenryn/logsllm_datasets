### Compact VDisk

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `compact vdisk` command reduces the physical size of a dynamically expanding virtual hard disk (VHD) file. This is particularly useful because, while dynamically expanding VHDs grow in size as you add files, they do not automatically shrink when files are deleted.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
compact vdisk
```

**Remarks:**
- **Selection Requirement:** A dynamically expanding VHD must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the `select vdisk` command to select and focus on the desired VHD.
- **State Requirements:** You can only compact dynamically expanding VHDs that are either detached or attached as read-only.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage the storage space used by your VHDs.
