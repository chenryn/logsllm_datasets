Reduces the physical size of a dynamically expanding virtual hard disk (VHD) file. This parameter is useful because dynamically expanding VHDs increase in size as you add files, but they do not automatically reduce in size when you delete files.
Syntax
compact vdisk
Remarks
A dynamically expanding VHD must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the select vdisk command to select a VHD and shift the focus to it.
You can only use compact dynamically expanding VHDs that are detached or attached as read-only.
