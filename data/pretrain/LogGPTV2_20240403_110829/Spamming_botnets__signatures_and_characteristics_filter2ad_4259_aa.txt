ABSTRACT
In this paper, we focus on characterizing spamming botnets by
leveraging both spam payload and spam server trafﬁc properties.
Towards this goal, we developed a spam signature generation frame-
work called AutoRE to detect botnet-based spam emails and botnet
membership. AutoRE does not require pre-classiﬁed training data
or white lists. Moreover, it outputs high quality regular expression
signatures that can detect botnet spam with a low false positive rate.
Using a three-month sample of emails from Hotmail, AutoRE suc-
cessfully identiﬁed 7,721 botnet-based spam campaigns together
with 340,050 unique botnet host IP addresses.
Our in-depth analysis of the identiﬁed botnets revealed several
interesting ﬁndings regarding the degree of email obfuscation, prop-
erties of botnet IP addresses, sending patterns, and their correlation
with network scanning trafﬁc. We believe these observations are
useful information in the design of botnet detection schemes.

INTRODUCTION
Botnets have been widely used for sending spam emails at a large
scale [14, 4, 19, 24]. By programming a large number of distributed
bots, spammers can effectively transmit thousands of spam emails
in a short duration. To date, detecting and blacklisting individual
bots is commonly regarded as difﬁcult, due to both the transient
nature of the attack and the fact that each bot may send only a
few spam emails. Furthermore, despite the increasing awareness of

botnet infection and their associated control process [4, 17, 6], little
effort has been devoted to understanding the aggregate behaviors of
botnets from the perspective of large email servers that are popular
targets of botnet spam attacks.
An important goal of this paper is to perform a large scale analy-
sis of spamming botnet characteristics and identify trends that can
beneﬁt future botnet detection and defense mechanisms.
In our
analysis, we make use of an email dataset collected from a large
email service provider, namely, MSN Hotmail. Our study not only
detects botnet membership across the Internet, but also tracks the
sending behavior and the associated email content patterns that are
directly observable from an email service provider.
Information
pertaining to botnet membership can be used to prevent future ne-
farious activities such as phishing and DDoS attacks. Understand-
ing the email sending behavior of botnets can facilitate the devel-
opment of new botnet detection techniques.
Our investigation is based on a novel framework called AutoRE
that identiﬁes botnet hosts by generating botnet spam signatures
from emails. AutoRE is motivated in part by the recent success
of signature based worm and virus detection systems (e.g.,
[12,
21, 16, 15, 13]). The framework is based on the premise that botnet
spam emails are often sent in an aggregate fashion, resulting in con-
tent prevalence similar to the worm propagation case. In particular,
we focus primarily on URLs embedded in email content because
they form the most critical part of spam emails – URLs play an
important role in directing users to phishing Web pages or targeted
product Web sites [2] 1.
However, the following two observations make it challenging to
derive URL signatures that distinguish botnet spam from others.
First, spam emails often contain multiple URLs, some of which are
legitimate and very general (e.g., http://www.w3.org). The
mixture of legitimate and spam URLs in an email requires us to
clearly separate them. Second, spammers deliberately add random-
ness into URLs to evade detection. Therefore, sifting through poly-
morphic URLs to identify common patterns is a critical task.
AutoRE addresses the ﬁrst challenge by iteratively selecting spam
URLs based on the distributed yet bursty property of botnets-based
spam campaigns. AutoRE does not require labeled data or whitelists,
a common necessity in most previous solutions. AutoRE further
outputs regular expression signatures that are different from tradi-
tional worm signatures that consist of either ﬁxed strings or token
conjunctions (token1.*token2.*token2). Compared with complete
URL (ﬁxed string) based signatures, regular expression signatures
are more robust and can detect 10 times more spam emails. Com-
pared with token conjunction based signatures, regular expression
1Based on an analysis of sampled emails sent to Hotmail, we found
that 74.1% of spam emails contained at least one URL (with the
remainder mostly geared towards campaigns for penny stocks)
signatures can signiﬁcantly reduce the false positive rate of detect-
ing polymorphic URLs (by 10 to 30 times in our experiments).
Furthermore, AutoRE uses the generated spam URL signatures
to group emails into spam campaigns, where a campaign refers to
a targeted spam effort to a single product or service. In this paper,
we identify spam campaigns originating from botnets. Using three
months of sampled emails from Hotmail, AutoRE successfully de-
tected 7,721 spam campaigns that originated from 340,050 distinct
botnet host IP addresses spanning 5,916 ASes. Below, we brieﬂy
summarize several desirable features of AutoRE:
(cid:129) Low false positive rate: Using AutoRE signatures, we identi-
ﬁed 580,466 spam emails with a false positive rate of 0.002.
AutoRE’s false positive rate in detecting botnet hosts is less
than 0.005.
(cid:129) Ability to detect stealthy botnet-based spam: AutoRE detects
16-18% of spam that bypassed well known blacklists (e.g.,
Spamhaus [22]) that are deployed by major mail providers.
(cid:129) Ability to detect frequent domain modiﬁcations: Using domain-
agnostic signatures, AutoRE is able to capture spam URLs
even if spammers adopt new domains. This enables us to
ﬁlter 15 times more spam than using domain speciﬁc signa-
tures.
Another important contribution of our work is an in-depth analy-
sis of identiﬁed spamming botnet characteristics and their activity
trends. Our key ﬁndings include:
(1) By comparing botnet statistics in July 2007 to those obtained
in Nov 2006, we noticed that the number of spam campaigns dou-
bled, while the total number of botnet IPs increased by only 10%.
This indicates that botnets are becoming an increasingly popular
mechanism for spam delivery and that one botnet host is involved
in multiple attacks.
(2) Even though a spam campaign directs email users to the
same/similar set of destination Web pages, the text content of the
emails in a campaign varies signiﬁcantly. When viewed individu-
ally, a botnet host does not exhibit distinctive sending patterns com-
pared to a legitimate host. These observations suggest that detect-
ing botnet hosts individually based on their email text or sending
features is difﬁcult.
(3) However, as an aggregate, spam emails from botnets are of-
ten sent in a highly synchronized fashion. Hosts within the same
campaign also exhibit similar sending patterns (e.g., the number of
recipients per email and connection rate). Surprisingly, many dis-
tinct spam campaigns behave similarly, suggesting that they may all
utilize the same spam sending tools. This implies that we may de-
tect botnet hosts by looking for aggregated common features from
concurrent email sending activities.
(4) Finally, we correlate the botnet activities with the network
telescope data [7]. Our analysis reveals that botnet attacks might
have different phases. Thus, it may be possible to identify them by
exploring network scanning patterns.
In the rest of this paper, we ﬁrst discuss related work and the
challenges in our work (Section 2). We then present the AutoRE
data processing ﬂow (Section 3) and elaborate on our regular ex-
pression generation scheme (Section 4). We present our experimen-
tal results in Section 5, and describe our evaluation in Section 6.
Using the inferred botnet membership information, we study their
characteristics in Section 7. Finally, we discuss the limitations of
the AutoRE framework (Section 8) before we conclude.
2. BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGES
The term botnet refers to a group of compromised host com-
puters that are controlled by a small number of commander hosts
referred to as Command and Control (C&C) servers. Due to the
increased use of botnets for launching large-scale network attacks,
several recent studies have looked at different aspects of bot activ-
ities: infection process [6], communication channels between bots
and C&C servers [4, 17], and propagation strategies [5, 10, 11].
Identiﬁcation and prevention of email spam that originate from
botnets is the primary focus of this paper. In this problem space,
Ramachandran et al. [19] performed a large scale study of the network-
behavior of spammers, providing strong evidence that botnets are
commonly used as platforms for sending spam. Anderson et al.
studied interesting characteristics of Internet scam infrastructures
using Spamscatter [2], a system that analyzes spam email URLs.
Webb et al. studied the link between spam emails and Web spam
using a large Web spam corpus [23]. More recently, Ramachan-
dran et al. proposed ways to infer botnet membership and identify
spammers by monitoring queries to DNSBL [18] and by clustering
email servers based on their target email destination domains [20].
These approaches have all provided insight into various aspects
of spamming activities and successfully explored opportunities for
monitoring different spam trafﬁc. In contrast, our work focuses on
the problem of not just detecting botnet hosts, but also correctly
grouping them based on spam campaigns. We hope such a collec-
tive view can shed light on how botnets operate and evolve as an
aggregate to facilitate the detection of future attacks. We adopt the
generic perspective of an email server receiving incoming trafﬁc
destined to a single domain without additional communication to
other infrastructure servers or services. Any solution in such a set-
ting could potentially be adopted autonomously by email service
providers or ISPs.
In a similar context, Zhuang et al. showed that the similarity of
email texts can help identify botnet-based spam campaigns [25].
Li and Hsish performed a measurement study where they exam-
ined various content features including spam URL links [14]. They
found that spam emails with identical URLs are highly clusterable
and are often sent in a burst. These observations motivated us to de-
velop techniques that extract spam URL signatures for large-scale
spamming botnet detection and analysis.
The spam URL signature generation problem is in many ways
similar to the content-based worm signature generation problem
that has been extensively studied (e.g., [21, 12, 16, 15, 13]). De-
spite the fact that botnet spam exhibits content prevalence like the
worm propagation case, two challenges remain in practice, prevent-
ing us from directly adopting existing solutions:
First, spammers often add random, legitimate URLs to content in
order to increase the perceived legitimacy of emails. Furthermore,
HTML-based emails often contain URLs generated by standard
software (e.g. compliance to HTML standards). Figure 1 shows
an example of three emails all sharing the highlighted URL, but are
also mixed with a number of other URLs. In our dataset, a total of
203 emails containing this highlighted URL were sent on the same
day from 70 different IP addresses spanning 15 ASes. We suspect
the corresponding hosts were from the same botnet.
Due to the mixing of legitimate and spam URLs in the email
content, we cannot adopt the approach taken by many existing so-
lutions (e.g.,
[12, 16, 15]) where trafﬁc is pre-classiﬁed into le-
gitimate and suspicious pools. Instead, AutoRE takes an approach
similar to the one used in Earlybird [21] by seeking both content
prevalence and source address dispersion. However, Earlybird uses
a white list to remove false positives such as common protocol
headers or P2P trafﬁc. Although white listing is effective in the
worm signature extraction case, we do not use this approach here
as spammers can easily abuse legitimate Web sites. It was reported
that Google’s feeling lucky feature was exploited by spammers as a

mechanism for redirection 2. Instead, AutoRE ensures a low false
positive rate by using an iterative approach to identify spam URLs,
detailed in Section 3.
The second challenge arises from spammers’ extensive use of
URL obfuscation techniques to evade detection. Additionally, spam-
mers often customize URLs to reﬂect recipients’ email address,
with the goal of tracking users that visit spamming web-sites. Fig-
ure 2 shows two examples of polymorphic spam URLs: the ﬁrst
group contained 66 URLs (only 3 are shown in the illustration) with
random words inserted at the tails; these were sent from 38 ASes
on a single day. The second group had 72 URLs, each attached
with an encrypted email address.
Previous systems also looked at the problem of detecting poly-
morphic worms. These systems output keyword/token conjunction
signatures like token1.*token2.* (e.g.,
[16, 15]). However, to-
ken conjunction based signatures cannot be directly applied to the
URL case as URL strings are typically much shorter than worm bi-
nary executables. Furthermore, URL strings mostly contain human
readable words and substring segments, suggesting that keywords
(tokens) extracted from spam URLs may largely be short, regular,
and predictable substrings. Looking at these substrings alone with-
out checking the structure of the URLs could potentially result in a
high false positive rate.
AutoRE goes one step further to generate regular expression sig-
natures. As we will show in Section 5, compared to token con-
junctions, regular expressions signiﬁcantly increase the expressive
power of signatures and in fact reduced the false positive rate by
30 times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst successful
attempt to automatically generate regular expression signatures.
3. AUTORE: SIGNATURE BASED BOTNET
IDENTIFICATION
In this section, we present AutoRE – a framework for automat-
ically generating URL signatures to identify botnet-based spam
campaigns. As input, AutoRE takes only a set of unlabeled email
messages (messages are not tagged as spam/non-spam), and pro-
2This problem at Google has been ﬁxed after it was found. Google

duces two outputs: a set of spam URL signatures, and a related list
of botnet host IP addresses. The resulting URL signature(s) could
be either in the form of a complete URL string or a URL regular
expression. These signatures can be used to identify both present
and future spam emails that originate from botnets. The knowledge
of botnet host identities can help ﬁlter other spam emails that could
potentially originate from these infected hosts. In this paper, we
did not consider using AutoRE in a real time fashion, though we
discuss such a scenario in Section 8.
We emphasize that AutoRE is completely automatic. It does not
require labeled training data in order to generate signatures. Au-
toRE operates by identifying unique behaviors exhibited by bot-
nets – in particular it seeks to discover email trafﬁc patterns that are
bursty and distributed. The notion of “burstiness" reﬂects the fact
that emails originating from botnet hosts are sent in a highly syn-
chronized fashion as spammers typically rent botnets for a short pe-
riod. The notion of “distributed" captures the fact that botnet hosts
usually span a large and dispersed IP address space. AutoRE em-
ploys an iterative algorithm to identify botnet based spam emails
that ﬁt the above trafﬁc proﬁles. Additionally, it generates “spe-
ciﬁc" regular expression signatures, where the learned signatures
strive to encode maximal information about the matching URLs
that characterize the underlying spam emails.
At a high level, AutoRE is comprised of the following three mod-
ules (Figure 3): a URL preprocessor, a Group selector and a RegEx
generator. The URL preprocessor extracts URLs and other rel-
evant ﬁelds from input emails and groups them according to Web
domains. Each URL group is then treated as a candidate while iden-
tifying spam campaigns. The Group selector selects URL groups
with the highest degree of burstiness in sending time and feeds such
groups to the RegEx generator. Finally, the RegEx generator mod-
ule extracts signatures by processing one group at a time. Every
time a signature is generated by the RegEx generator, all its match-
ing emails and associated URLs are discarded from the pool of re-
maining URL groups to avoid further consideration. This process is
continued in an iterative fashion until all the groups are processed.
3.1 URL Pre-Processing
Given a set of emails, AutoRE begins by extracting the follow-
ing information: URL string, source server IP address and email
sending time. In addition, AutoRE assigns a unique email ID to
represent the email from which a URL was extracted. During this
process, we discard all forwarded emails (about 17% of total emails)
from our analysis as this avoids mistakenly identifying a legitimate
forwarding server as a botnet member.
The URL preprocessor then partitions URLs into groups based
on their Web domains. This partitioning is motivated based on the
observation that emails originating from the same spam campaign
tend to advertise the same product or service from the same do-
main (we discuss URL redirection cases in Section 8). By group-
ing URLs from the same domain together, the search scope for bot-
