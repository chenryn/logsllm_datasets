DarkHydrus has employed various spearphishing tactics to distribute malicious payloads. One such method involves sending emails with password-protected RAR archives that contain malicious Excel Web Query files (`.iqy`). Additionally, the group has been known to send spearphishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents. These documents utilize the "attachedTemplate" technique to load a template from a remote server, thereby executing the payload.[70][71][72]
