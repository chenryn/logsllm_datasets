### Logging Email Buffer
**Description:**  
This command configures log email settings.

**Syntax:**  
`[no] logging email buffer [number <num>] [time <minutes>]`

**Parameters:**
- `num`: Specifies the maximum number of messages to buffer (16-256). The default number is 50 messages.
- `minutes`: Specifies how long to wait before sending all buffered messages if the buffer contains fewer than the maximum allowed number of messages. You can specify 10-1440 minutes. The default time is 10 minutes.

**Default:**  
By default, emailing of log messages is disabled. When you enable the feature, the buffer options have the default values described above.

**Mode:**  
Configuration mode

**Usage:**  
To configure the ACOS device to send log messages by email, you must also configure an email filter and specify the email address to which to email the log messages. See “logging email filter” on page 148 and “logging email-address” on page 151.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# logging email buffer number 32 time 30
```

### Logging Email Filter
**Description:**  
This command configures a filter for emailing log messages.

**Syntax:**  
`[no] logging email filter <filter-num> "<conditions>" <operators> [trigger]`

**Parameters:**
- `filter-num`: Specify the filter number (1-8).
- `conditions`: Message attributes on which to match. The conditions list can contain one or more of the following:
  - Severity levels of messages to send in email. Specify the severity levels by number or word (0 - emergency, 1 - alert, 2 - critical, 3 - error, 4 - warning, 5 - notification, 6 - information, 7 - debugging).
  - Software modules for which to email messages. Messages are emailed only if they come from one of the specified software modules.
  - Regular expression. Standard regular expression syntax is supported. Only messages that meet the criteria of the regular expression will be emailed.
- `operators`: Set of Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) that specify how the conditions should be compared. The CLI Boolean expression syntax is based on Reverse Polish Notation (also called Postfix Notation), a notation method that places an operator (AND, OR, NOT) after all of its operands (in this case, the conditions list).
- `trigger`: Immediately sends the matching messages in an email instead of buffering them. If you omit this option, the messages are buffered based on the logging email buffer settings.

**Default:**  
Not set. Emailing of log messages is disabled by default.

**Mode:**  
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
- You can configure up to 8 filters. The filters are used in numerical order, starting with filter 1. When a message matches a filter, the message will be emailed based on the buffer settings. No additional filters are used to examine the message.
- A maximum of 8 conditions are supported in a filter.
- The total number of conditions plus the number of Boolean operators supported in a filter is 16.
- The filter requires a valid module name, even if you omit the module option.
- For backward compatibility, the following syntax from previous releases is still supported: `logging email severity-level`.

**Examples:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# logging email filter 1 "level information pattern abc and"
ACOS(config)# logging email filter 1 "level information pattern abc and" trigger
ACOS(config)# logging email filter 1 "level warning module AFLEX and"
ACOS(config)# logging email filter 2 "pattern disk is full level critical or"
ACOS(config)# logging email filter 3 "module SYSTEM module ALB or level alert pattern unexpected error or and"
```

### Logging Email Address
**Description:**  
This command specifies the email addresses to which to send event messages.

**Syntax:**  
`[no] logging email-address <address>`

**Parameters:**
- `address`: Email address to which event messages will be sent. To specify multiple email addresses, use the `logging email-address` command once for each address.

**Default:**  
None

**Mode:**  
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
- To configure the ACOS device to send log messages by email, you must also configure an email filter. See “logging email filter” on page 148.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# logging email-address PI:EMAIL
ACOS(config)# logging email-address PI:EMAIL
```

### Logging Export
**Description:**  
This command sends the messages that are in the event buffer to an external file server.

**Syntax:**  
`[no] logging export [all] [use-mgmt-port] <url>`

**Parameters:**
- `all`: Include system support messages.
- `use-mgmt-port`: Use the management interface as the source interface for the connection to the remote device. The management route table is used to reach the device. Without this option, the ACOS device attempts to use the data route table to reach the remote device through a data interface.
- `url`: Saves a backup of the log to a remote server. You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press Enter to display a prompt for each part of the URL. If you enter the entire URL and a password is required, you will still be prompted for the password. The password can be up to 255 characters long.

**Default:**  
Not set

**Mode:**  
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
- If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the `device-context` command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# logging export ftp://exampleuser@examplehost/event-buffer-messages.txt
```

### Logging Facility
**Description:**  
This command enables logging facilities.

**Syntax:**

**Default:**  
The default facility is local0.

**Mode:**  
Configuration mode

### Logging Host
**Description:**  
This command specifies a Syslog server to which to send event messages.

**Syntax:**  
`[no] logging host <ipaddr> [port <protocol-port> [tcp]] [use-mgmt-port]`

**Parameters:**
- `ipaddr`: IP address of the Syslog server.
- `protocol-port`: Protocol port number to which to send messages (1-32767).
- `tcp`: Use TCP as the transport protocol.
- `use-mgmt-port`: Establish the connection to the Syslog server using the management port.

**Default:**  
The default protocol port is 514.

**Mode:**  
Global configuration

**Usage:**
- Multiple log servers can be created by using the `logging host` command once for each server. If you use the command with the same IP address as an existing logging server, it replaces any existing configuration for that existing server.

**Example:**
```plaintext
ACOS(config)# logging host 10.10.10.1
ACOS(config)# logging host 10.10.10.2
```
