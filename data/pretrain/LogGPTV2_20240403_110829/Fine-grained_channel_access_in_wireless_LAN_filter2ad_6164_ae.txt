radio implementation, we can bound the maximal symbol timing
misalignment within the range discussed in Section 3.1. Then, we
evaluate the efﬁciency and reliability of detecting BAM-modulated
PHY signals in M-RTS/M-CTS. Finally, we show the decoding per-
formance of our FICA decoder for two concurrent FICA senders.

We perform our experiments in the 2.4GHz band with 802.11b/g-
compatible RF front-ends. Due to timing constraints, we have pre-
stored all needed PHY frame samples on the RCB ﬁrst. We also
conduct the experiments late at night to minimize interference from
other trafﬁc in the same frequency band.
6.1 Symbol timing misalignment in a WLAN
As discussed in Section 3.1, there are two ways to coordinate
concurrent transmissions in a WLAN: using a reference broadcast
(e.g., M-CTS) or carrier sensing on an idle channel. These two
methods result in different performance requirements in aligning
symbol times.
To measure the symbol timing misalignment with broadcasting,
the AP broadcasts an M-CTS symbol and two stations, when they
detect the M-CTS, wait for a ﬁxed 200(cid:22)s and return two differ-
ent Pseudo-Noise (PN) signals. We use PN signals so that we can
easily separate the two signals by cross-correlation, and precisely
measure the time difference of the arrivals of the two signals at the
AP by counting the number of samples between the two correlation
peaks. Figure 12 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of 1,000 tests. In over 95% of the cases, the symbol timing differ-
ence of these two transmissions is less than 1(cid:22)s, and in 99% cases
the timing difference is less than 2(cid:22)s.
To characterize the maximal symbol time difference when coor-
dinating with carrier sensing, we use the following method. After
the AP sends out a broadcast symbol, one station waits for a ﬁxed
200(cid:22)s and transmit its PN signal. We adjust the waiting time of
the second station incrementally from 200(cid:22)s to 220(cid:22)s, performing
around 100 tests for each value. Upon timeout, the second station
performs carrier sensing ﬁrst. If it senses a busy channel, it will
cancel its transmission attempt and the AP will only receive one
PN signal from the ﬁrst station. Otherwise, if the second station
senses an idle channel, it will send a different PN signal. The AP
will then detect two PN signals and measure the time difference
between their arrivals.
Figure 13 shows the results of this experiment. The x-axis shows
the relative delay of the second station to the ﬁrst station. The dark
line shows the probability of the second station sensing the trans-
mission of the ﬁrst node. We see that if the relative delay is larger
than 9(cid:22)s, the second node will always sense the ﬁrst node’s trans-
mission and cancel its own sending attempt. The 9(cid:22)s threshold
reﬂects the turnaround time of Sora, which is about 5(cid:22)s, and the
carrier sensing time of 4(cid:22)s we used in this experiment. When the
relative delay is less than 8(cid:22)s, the second node always senses an
idle channel and concurrent transmissions occur.
The rectangular points mark the difference in the arrival time of
the two signals, and the error bars indicate the minimal and maxi-
mal values measured. The timing misalignment linearly increases
with the relative delay, as expected. Note that, when the relative
delay is between 8–9(cid:22)s, carrier sensing may not always work and
results in larger variance. Overall, the symbol timing misalignment
is within 10(cid:22)s, conﬁrming our analysis in Section 3.1.

6.2 Reliability of PHY signaling
In this experiment, we evaluate the reliability of the PHY signal-
ing implementation. Two nodes transmit the same M-RTS symbol
simultaneously so that every subcarrier contains a superposition of
the signals transmitted by the two senders. The AP detects the in-
formation on each subcarrier. Since we know what is exactly trans-
mitted, we can detect false positives (i.e., the AP detects one on
a subcarrier that should be zero) and false negatives (i.e., the AP
detects zero where it should be one). We use the self-calibrated
method to set detection threshold as described in Section 5: we
measure the maximal energy Nf on the blank subcarriers and set
the threshold to be (cid:11)Nf , varying (cid:11). We also experiment with dif-
ferent degrees of bit replication on subcarriers.
Figure 14 shows the error rates for 1,000 tests at various degrees
of replication as we vary the threshold (cid:11). With a large threshold,
false positives decrease while false negatives increase slightly (al-
though still less than 0:5%). Overall, though, there is quite a large
space for threshold setting to provide good performance. In par-
ticular, when a bit is replicated on a few subcarriers (e.g., 4), both
false positive and negative rates are close to zero when (cid:11) is in the
range 3–5. We hypothesize that, with more simultaneous transmis-
sions, the detection should be more reliable as BAM is essentially
energy detection. With more transmissions superposed, the energy
is additive at the receiver side. However, due to limited hardware
availability we leave this for future study.
6.3 Demodulation performance
In this experiment, we compare the demodulation performance
of FICA, where multiple nodes are allowed to simultaneously ac-
cess different subchannels, to the conventional WLAN, where only
a single node can access the whole channel. We have one FICA sta-
tion access only the odd-numbered subchannels and another FICA
station access only the even-numbered subchannels. Thus, these
two stations maximally interleave their subchannels and should be

nel at a time.
more sensitive to mutual inter-subchannel interference if there is
any. We ﬁx the position of the AP and two stations and adjust the
transmission power to get different signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR).
For each SNR setting, we evaluate four different modulation schemes.
We schedule the transmissions in the following way. For each trans-
mission power setting, we let two stations access the channel si-
multaneously using FICA ﬁrst, and then immediately one station
transmits alone. Since these two transmissions are back-to-back,
we assume their channel conditions should be similar. For each
power setting, we send 1400 frames. Each frame is 400 bytes and
uses one subchannel.
We use the classic bit-error-rate (BER) to SNR plot to illustrate
the demodulation performance. Figure 15 shows the results for
FICA as well as the case where only one node accesses the chan-
nel. The BER value shown is measured before the Viterbi decoder;
after Viterbi, most of the errors are corrected. Clearly, all curves
are very close to each other, including the high rate modulations
like 64QAM which are very sensitive to interference. Thus, we
conclude that with FICA different nodes can transmit on different
subchannels simultaneously without interfering with each other.

downlink OFDMA in a WLAN and per-subcarrier rate adaptation.
But, since there is only one transmitter (the AP), symbol align-
ment is not an issue. In [5] and similarly in [11], OFDM has been
used as a simple form of concurrent channel access. Nodes may
modulate one bit of ACK information on different subcarriers after
receiving a broadcast frame. However, FICA is a new PHY/MAC
framework for WLANs that enables data communication over ﬁne-
grained subchannels to improve overall network efﬁciency.
Physical layer signaling, usually with Binary Amplitude Modu-
lation, has been used previously to assist MAC protocols. In [8,13],
busy tones are used to indicate channel occupancy to mitigate the
hidden terminal problem. Recently, SMACK [5] uses a physical
layer ACK, and MCBC [20] uses a PHY RTS/CTS handshake to fa-
cilitate a multi-round leader election protocol in a heavy-contention
environment; after the protocol completes, the winner obtains ac-
cess to the medium. FICA similarly shares the idea with SMACK
and MCBC to apply PHY signaling based on simple BAM modula-
tion, but FICA has the broader goal of enabling ﬁne-grained chan-
nel access in high data rate WLANs.
Coordination using broadcast in local area networks has been
previously exploited for time synchronization in reference-broadcasting
synchronization, which provides microsecond-level synchroniza-
tion precision [6]. Our results further conﬁrm that microsecond-
level coordination accuracy is practical in WLANs.

performance by ﬁne-tuning the backoff scheme [9, 10]. But these
approaches still consider the channel as one resource unit where
only one radio can work on one channel at a time. Multi-channel
MAC protocols [16] have been studied to improve wireless network
performance by using more orthogonal channels that are separated
by guard bands. In contrast, FICA improves the performance of
WLANs by increasing channel access efﬁciency. Using OFDM,
FICA creates a ﬁne-grained structure (i.e., subchannels) for multi-
access inside a wide-band channel without guard bands. Thus, a
FICA node can adjust the portion of the spectrum it accesses based
on its trafﬁc demands, while other nodes can use the remaining
spectrum simultaneously. This property shares some similarity to
the adaptive channel width demonstrated in [4]. FICA is comple-
mentary to that work by providing a concrete means for adaptive
ﬁne-grained subchannel access in WLANs.
The inefﬁciency of the 802.11 MAC has also been discussed be-
fore for supporting VoIP trafﬁc [22,27]. In [27], a TDMA approach
is used to reduce the contention overhead for CSMA in 802.11. In
this paper, we argue that the inefﬁciency of 802.11 MAC is a fun-
damental bottleneck as the PHY data rate increases for all trafﬁc,
not just VoIP trafﬁc. We further argue that this inefﬁciency issue
should be resolved by enabling ﬁne-grained channel access.
8. CONCLUSION
This paper addresses the inefﬁciency issue of MAC protocols in
current WLANs as the PHY data rate increases. The fundamental
reason of this inefﬁciency lies in the fact that the current MAC pro-
tocol allocates the entire wide-band channel as a single resource.
Such allocation become too coarse-grained for general trafﬁc de-
mands as the channel width or the PHY data rate increases.
We argue that this inefﬁciency issue should be resolved using
ﬁne-grained channel access in high data rate WLANs. We present
the design of FICA, a new cross-layer design that enables ﬁne-
grained subchannel random access based on OFDM. FICA addresses
challenges in both PHY and MAC design due to the asynchronous
and distributed nature of WLANs. First, FICA proposes a new
PHY architecture based on OFDM that retains orthogonality among
subchannels solely relying on the coordination mechanisms in ex-
isting WLANs. Second, FICA employs frequency-domain con-
tention that uses physical layer RTS/CTS signaling, and frequency
domain backoff to efﬁciently coordinate subchannel access.
We have implemented FICA on the Sora software radio platform.
With our prototype, we validate the feasibility of the FICA cross-
layer design. Our detailed simulation results further indicate that
FICA can outperform 802.11 with frame aggregation with up to
400% under different trafﬁc settings.
