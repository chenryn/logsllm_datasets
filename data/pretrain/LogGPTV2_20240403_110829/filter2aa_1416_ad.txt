### Software Defined Radio Direction Finding (SDR DF)

#### Applications
- **Radio Navigation**
  - Predecessor to RADAR
- **SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)**
- **Emergency Aid**
  - Avalanche Rescue
- **Wildlife Tracking**
- **Reconnaissance**
  - Trajectory Tracking
- **Sports**

#### History
- **World War I & II**
  - Y-stations along the British coastline
  - U-Adcock System: Four 10m high vertical aerials around a hut
  - DF Goniometer for angle measurement
  - Used to find the bearing to U-boats in the Atlantic

- **HF/DF (HUFF DUFF)**
  - HF: 3-30 MHz
  - Long wavelengths for large distances
  - Large installations: AN/FLR-9 array near Augsburg, Germany

- **Amateur RDF (Radio Direction Finding)**
  - Fox hunts
  - Competitions on the '2-meter band' ARDF course
  - Highly-directional Yagi antenna

#### Doppler DF
- **Principle**:
  - Exploit Doppler shifting of radio waves caused by the motion of an antenna
  - Measure the shift in detected signal to determine the direction of transmission

- **Doppler Effect Recap**:
  - Observed frequency increases as the object approaches and decreases as it passes
  - Misconception: Higher sound pressure levels affect perceived pitch differently for low and high frequencies

- **Frequency Modulation (FM)**
  - Analog or digital information
  - Main transmission frequency (e.g., 105.7 MHz)
  - Frequency modulation changes the carrier’s frequency, moving it slightly left/right of its original position on the frequency plot

- **Mechanical Rotation Rate**:
  - Doppler equation relates Doppler shift, radius of antenna, angular velocity, and frequency of the signal
  - For a small antenna setup tuned to 2m wavelength (~150 MHz), requires 38600 RPM or ~643 rotations per second

- **Pseudo-Doppler**:
  - Array of fixed antennas
  - Electronically switch between them to simulate physical rotation

- **Home-made RDF (Roanoke Doppler)**:
  - Four antennas
  - Control box
  - Plug in any standard FM radio
  - LEDs indicate direction

- **Software Defined RDF**:
  - Antenna Array
  - Antenna Switch
  - FPGA Modification: Use USRP clock to control the antenna array
  - Map sample counter’s bits to unused GPIO
  - Benefits: Ensures antenna switching is in lockstep with samples, calibrates array orientation once

- **Signal Processing Tricks**:
  - Sample rate: (FPGA clock / decimation)
  - MSB of sample counter: 31st and 32nd bits
  - Tone frequency: 250k / 32 = 7.8125 kHz
  - FFT bins: ((250 ksps / 5) / 1024) * 7812.5 = 160 exactly

- **FM Demodulation**:
  - Multiply current signal sample by complex conjugate of previous one and find the argument (angle)

- **Doppler Sine Wave**:
  - Frequency plot (FFT) of FM-demodulated signal
  - Pure Doppler sine wave after filtering

- **Reference and Measured Signals**:
  - Find a target (e.g., Telstra Tower on Council St)
  - Drive and measure direction
  - Complications: Line-of-sight reflections, urban multipath, and multiple wavefronts

- **Super-resolution Algorithms (MUSIC: MUltiple SIgnal Classification)**:
  - Simultaneously receive multiple streams
  - Apply a mathematical model for far-field wavefronts
  - Calculate sample correlation matrix, eigenvector decomposition, and orthogonal subspaces
  - Search through array response to find peak DOA

- **Calibration**:
  - Use shared Local Oscillator
  - Inject shared tone in each channel
  - Calculate per-channel phase differences
  - Apply corrections and periodically re-calibrate

- **Police Checklist**:
  - Car registration
  - Amateur Radio license
  - Antenna structural redundancy
  - Dress code
  - Clean-shaven
  - Hide Motorola XTS radios
  - Avoid turning around and disconnecting antennas

- **Gedanken Experiments**:
  - TX: Do not try this at home!
  - Pagers: Send wild goose chases, issue alerts
  - Mode S: Create false aircraft positions
  - ACARS: Send fault reports, engine performance reports
  - Satellite: Uplink power, weather-dependent, potential interference
