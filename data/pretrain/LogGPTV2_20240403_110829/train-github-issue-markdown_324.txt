## Expected Behavior
After resizing my window tooltips should be repositioned correctly to avoid
unnecessary scrollbars.
## Current Behavior
When i resize a window to a certain point which has a tooltip at the edge then
the tooltip is wrongly positioned after the resize which results in
unnecessary scrollbars. After moving the mouse over the button which creates
the tooltip a few times it gets into the correct position
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/m7p9qlpjnp
  1. Resize the whole window until unnecessary scrollbars appear
  2. Simply hover over the button
  3. After moving the mouse away and again over the button the tooltip moves
  4. After doing that a few times it moves into the correct position it should have been in initially
## Context
It currently affects me when i resize my application (see image below) -> then
scrollbars appear due to the tooltip position, which shouldn't be there. After
moving over and away from the button serveral times the tooltip is positioned
correctly.
