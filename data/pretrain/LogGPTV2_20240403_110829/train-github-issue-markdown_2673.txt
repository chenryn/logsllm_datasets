I am fitting the same dataset to the `LinearRegression()` function, but I am obtaining slightly different model coefficients in two separate attempts.

**First Attempt:**
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_1 = 0.8927025598257011`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_2 = -1.697037974902777e-05`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_3 = -0.031210337831353692`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_4 = 0.0021041235932400064`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.intercept_ = 19.049368273019788`

**Second Attempt:**
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_1 = 0.8927025598256996`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_2 = -1.6970379749026318e-05`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_3 = -0.031210337831354636`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.coef_4 = 0.0021041235932399926`
- `self.ref_price_psf_model.intercept_ = 19.049368273019823`

I expected the coefficients to be exactly the same. Could you please help me understand what might be causing this discrepancy and how to resolve it?

Thank you.

### Possible Causes and Solutions

1. **Numerical Precision:**
   - **Cause:** Small differences in floating-point arithmetic can lead to slight variations in the coefficients.
   - **Solution:** This is usually not a concern unless the differences are significant. You can set a tolerance level for comparison.

2. **Random Initialization:**
   - **Cause:** Some algorithms use random initialization, which can lead to different results.
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the random seed is set to a fixed value if you want reproducibility.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Cause:** Differences in data preprocessing (e.g., scaling, normalization) between the two runs.
   - **Solution:** Verify that the data preprocessing steps are consistent and identical in both runs.

4. **Algorithm Implementation:**
   - **Cause:** The specific implementation of the `LinearRegression()` function may have some non-deterministic components.
   - **Solution:** Check the documentation or source code of the `LinearRegression()` function to ensure it is deterministic.

By addressing these potential causes, you should be able to achieve consistent results.
