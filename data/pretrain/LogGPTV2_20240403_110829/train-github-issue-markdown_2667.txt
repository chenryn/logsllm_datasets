Trying out electron for the first time and downloaded the latest version 0.28
(win x64). I basically copy and pasted the tutorial code from Quick Start
(https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md)
and was able to bring up a window. However I see the following error:  
Uncaught Error: Cannot find module './web-view/web-view-attributes'
(module.js:334)
I checked v0.27 and do not see this error.
