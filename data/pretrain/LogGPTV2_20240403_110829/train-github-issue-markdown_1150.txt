I have recently tried the 2.0 M2 Spring.jar and immediately found that what
was  
working for PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer is suddenly not working in 2.0.
I have a bean with a property like: ${queue.routerQueue}
and a property file like: queue.routerQueue=routerQueue1
but what is set in the bean, is ${queue.routerQueue} and not the substituted  
value. I am pretty certain that the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer bean is able  
to read the value - I have set breakpoints and extended the class to provide
JMX  
viewing of the properties and they are correct. However, when I set a
breakpoint at the 'setReadQueueName' method, the value passed in is
${queue.routerQueue}.
I have many, many properties set in my config files, and some get replaced and
others do not. I cannot actually track down a pattern just yet. Even though
some properties get replaced and some dont, it is very consistent when it
decides not to replace a property. That property is never replaced, but I dont
know why it decides to replace some but not others.
I would be happy to provide files and I will also look into this more over the
weekend.
