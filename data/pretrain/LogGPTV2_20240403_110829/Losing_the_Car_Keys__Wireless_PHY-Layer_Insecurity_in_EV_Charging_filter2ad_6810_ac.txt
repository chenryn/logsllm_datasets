#### Eavesdropping Results from Various Sites and Antenna Locations

The following table summarizes the eavesdropping results across multiple sites and antenna placements. The data includes peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bandwidth (BW), and packet counts, as well as the success rates of bidirectional traffic and session startup. The rates of well-formed messages and CRC32 checksum validations are also provided. The best and worst performance for each antenna location is highlighted in bold († indicates joint-worst).

**Table 2: Eavesdropping results, from all sites and antenna locations. Raw signal properties are quantified as Peak SNR and Bandwidth. PPDU counts are given, and the observance of bidirectional traffic and session startup is indicated. The rates of well-formed messages are then shown, along with the rates of CRC32 checksum validations. The worst and best performance for each antenna location is highlighted in bold († indicates joint-worst).**

**Figure 7: Eavesdropping from the next parking bay (site G), more than 4 meters away on the other side to the charging cable. In this arrangement, 91.8% of messages were received successfully.**

**Figure 8: Two vehicles charging simultaneously. With the eavesdropper between the two vehicles, 42.5% of messages were received successfully, including the NMK key establishment for both vehicles.**

**Figure 9: Observed signal across the HPGP bandwidth, at each antenna location. The HPGP spectral mask is overlaid to indicate the regions in which transmission occurs, although no valid comparison can be made with its power value as the measurement was not calibrated. Signal degradation and noise ingress is visible in every case, although far more prominently in (b) and (c).**

### 8.2 Effects of Location

While our primary goal was not a systematic examination of performance by location, we observed trends across tested antenna positions, with the fidelity of the wireless channel varying substantially. The closest representation of the transmitted signal is shown in Figure 9a, obtained approximately 0.5m from the charging cable. At other antenna positions, the signal loss was more pronounced, both inside and outside the vehicle, and in isolated cases, the signal was swamped by interference even at short distances from the cabling.

General predictions about the channel gain at specific distances are not feasible due to the low frequencies at which the PLC operates (2 – 28 MHz). Even at 28 MHz, the wavelength is still 10.7m, and all observations were taken well within the near field of the transmitter. In this region, common path loss calculations like the Friis equation [36] are not defined, and near-field effects can change the channel gain drastically from position to position.

Figures 9b and 9c show the results of tests at the greatest distances; 4.2m in the latter case when the antenna was positioned by a vehicle in an adjacent parking bay (shown in Figure 7). Interference is still substantial at these distances (e.g., everything below 15 MHz in Figs. 9b and 9c), but in the higher reaches of the band, the signal is still easily visible. The consistency of observed leakage across different charger hardware indicates that the issue is not isolated to a single implementation, supporting the claim that the design choices in CCS make a wireless side-channel for the PLC communication a systemic problem.

### 8.3 Message Recovery

With such a clear channel, message recovery proved highly successful, with hundreds of complete messages captured even in short sessions. In the best case, at site I, 100.0% of received messages had correct CRC32 checksums, and surprisingly, 91.8% were still received when the antenna was located in the next parking bay. Reception rates were broadly correlated with raw SNR and BW, with improvements to either benefiting the performance. However, this was not universal, as the very poor performance at sites B and K shows. Site B showed poor results despite far higher SNR and BW than Site K. Reception performance is broken down by location in Table 2, with the lowest minimum and highest maximum for each location highlighted in bold. Without ground-truth for the number of messages sent by each party, we cannot determine the number of messages missed entirely (only those received with errors), although the only unreported messages would be those that did not even trigger the packet detection algorithm (see Appendix B). Examining Frame Control headers showed that traffic was observed bidirectionally between vehicle and charger in all but two cases.

As charging stations, at least in public, are busy venues, we tested whether multiple simultaneous charging sessions caused interference that affected the wireless channel quality. Two vehicles (a Jaguar I-PACE and a VW e-Golf) charged simultaneously in 5 charging sessions at 2 locations, one of which is shown in Figure 8. In each case, one vehicle initiated charging first and then the second did so. The eavesdropper’s antenna was located between the two vehicles and attempted to listen to both. In all cases, the eavesdropper was able to listen to traffic from both vehicles, albeit with varying success. At worst, 24.3% of messages were received with correct CRC32, at best 94.8% (mean 59.7%).

### 9. Security Analysis

#### 9.1 Identifiers and Privacy

Persistent identifiers for the vehicle, such as its EV ID and MAC address, are available. These identifiers are persistent for the entire lifetime of the vehicle, including between owners, and are globally unique. They have been noted as personal data in previous privacy studies [40] and are covered by the European Union’s GDPR as data that can be easily combined with other sources to identify an individual.

#### 9.2 TLS and Charging Traffic

With contract-based billing, we do not expect charging traffic to be available, as TLS is always required in this case. However, as we have seen, when it is optional to omit TLS, this has consistently been done. Currently, this leaves the majority of charging traffic in the clear at public locations, although these are likely to be the earliest adopters of contract-based billing (or some alternative). The long-term omission of TLS at private locations is of greater concern. Indeed, it is in this case that there is more potential for behavioral profiling, due to the vehicle staying far longer at the user’s home or workplace and with the emerging Reactive Charging and V2G systems far more beneficial to them there. The introduction of ‘Vehicle-to-Home’ capabilities, for instance, is prioritized for introduction as early as 2020 by the CCS standards body [16]. Resulting indicators of the user’s day-to-day behavior, such as the vehicle’s state-of-charge and projected departure time, are contained within normal charging traffic, while reverse power flow data in a V2G system yields insights into the power usage of the building.

In addition to internet access for in-vehicle entertainment systems, third-party apps, and alternative payment networks, the traffic of any local services would also be available at public locations, as would smart home integration traffic in private ones.

#### 9.3 Charging Attacks

A reliable eavesdropping capability presents a range of opportunities for an attacker, both immediate and longer-term in their impact. We consider here a selection of potential attacks using these techniques. Although we did not perform the attacks against public chargers, we describe how they would be conducted.

**AutoCharge Systems:** Extant AutoCharge systems, such as one operating in production across a 60-location network in three European countries [33], are at particular risk from wireless eavesdropping. The use of the vehicle’s charge-controller MAC address for billing identification [58, 56], while highly questionable from a purely security standpoint, was undertaken for compatibility and convenience benefits (and has been lauded as such by customers). What may be an acceptable trade-off when physical interference is required to extract the values, is far less so when this can be done from a distance.
