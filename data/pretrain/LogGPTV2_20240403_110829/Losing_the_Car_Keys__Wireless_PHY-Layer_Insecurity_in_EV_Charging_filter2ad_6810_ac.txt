Table 2: Eavesdropping results, from all sites and antenna locations. Raw signal properties are quantiﬁed as Peak SNR and
Bandwidth. PPDU counts are given and the observance of bidirectional trafﬁc and session startup is indicated. The rates of
well-formed messages are then shown, along with the rates of CRC32 checksum validations. The worst and best performance
for each antenna location is highlighted in bold († indicates joint-worst).
Figure 7: Eavesdropping from the next parking bay (site G),
more than 4 metres away on the other side to the charging
cable. In this arrangement 91.8% of messages were received
successfully.
Figure 8: Two vehicles charging simultaneously. With the
eavesdropper between the two vehicles 42.5% of messages
were received successfully, including the NMK key estab-
lishment for both vehicles.

Figure 9: Observed signal across the HPGP bandwidth, at each antenna location. The HPGP spectral mask is overlaid to indicate
the regions in which transmission occurs, although no valid comparison can be made with its power value as the measurement
was not calibrated. Signal degradation and noise ingress is visible in every case, although far more prominently in (b) and (c).
8.2 Effects of Location
While systematic examination of performance by location
was not our goal, we were able to observe trends across
tested antenna positions, with the ﬁdelity of the wireless
channel varying substantially. The closest representation of
the transmitted signal is that shown in Figure 9a, obtained
approximately 0.5m from the charging cable. At other an-
tenna positions the signal loss was more pronounced, both
inside and outside of the vehicle, and in isolated cases the
signal was swamped by interference more than a short dis-
tance from the cabling. Making general predictions about
the channel gain at speciﬁc distances is not feasible due to
the low frequencies at which the PLC operates (2 – 28MHz).
Even at 28MHz the wavelength is still 10.7m and so all ob-
servations were taken well within the near ﬁeld of the trans-
mitter. In this region, common path loss calculations like the
Friis equation [36] are not deﬁned and near-ﬁeld effects can
change the channel gain drastically from position to position.
Nevertheless, Figures 9b and 9c show the results of tests at
the greatest distances; 4.2m in the latter case when the an-
tenna was positioned by a vehicle in an adjacent parking bay
(shown in Figure 7). Interference is still substantial at these
distances (e.g., everything below 15MHz in Figs. 9b and 9c),
but in the higher reaches of the band signal still easily visible.
The consistency of observed leakage across different
charger hardware indicates that the issue is not isolated to a
single implementation; supporting the claim that the design
choices in CCS make a wireless side-channel for the PLC
communication a systemic problem.
of received messages had correct CRC32 checksums, more
surprisingly 91.8% were still received when the antenna was
located in the next parking bay. Reception rates were broadly
correlated with raw SNR and BW, with improvements to
either beneﬁting the performance. However this was not
universal, as the very poor performance at sites B and K
shows. Site B showed poor results despite far higher SNR
and BW than Site K. Reception performance is broken down
by location in Table 2, with the lowest minimum and high-
est maximum for each location highlighted in bold. With-
out ground-truth for the number of messages sent by each
party, we cannot determine the number of messages missed
entirely (only those received with errors), although the only
unreported messages would be those that did not even trigger
the packet detection algorithm (see Appendix B). Examin-
ing Frame Control headers showed that trafﬁc was observed
bidirectionally between vehicle and charger in all but two
cases.
As charging stations, at least in public, are busy venues,
we tested whether multiple simultaneous charging sessions
caused interference that affected the wireless channel quality.
Two vehicles (a Jaguar I-PACE and a VW e-Golf) charged
simultaneously in 5 charging sessions at 2 locations, one of
which is shown in Figure 8. In each case, one vehicle ini-
tiated charging ﬁrst and then the second did so. The eaves-
dropper’s antenna was located between the two vehicles and
attempted to listen to both.
In all cases, the eavesdropper
was able to listen to trafﬁc from both vehicles, albeit with
varying success. At worst, 24.3% of messages were received
with correct CRC32, at best 94.8% (mean 59.7%).
8.3 Message Recovery
9 Security Analysis
With such a clear channel, message recovery proved highly
successful, with hundreds of complete messages captured
In the best case, at site I, 100.0%
even in short sessions.
In this section we analyse the captured communications and
their security implications.

tiﬁers for the vehicle are also available: its EV ID and its
MAC address. These identiﬁers are persistent for the en-
tire lifetime of the vehicle, including between owners, and
are globally unique. They have been noted as personal data
in previous privacy studies [40] and are covered by the Eu-
ropean Union’s GDPR as data that can be easily combined
with other sources to identify an individual.
With contract-based billing, we do not expect charging
trafﬁc to be available, as TLS is always required in this case.
However as we have seen, when it is optional to omit TLS,
this has consistently been done. Currently, this leaves the
majority of charging trafﬁc in the clear at public locations, al-
though these are likely to be the earliest adopters of contract-
based billing (or some alternative). The long-term omission
of TLS at private locations is of greater concern. Indeed it
is in this case that there is more potential for behavioural
proﬁling, due to the vehicle staying far longer at the user’s
home or workplace and with the emerging Reactive Charg-
ing and V2G systems far more beneﬁcial to them there. The
introduction of ‘Vehicle-to-Home’ capabilities, for instance,
is prioritised for introduction as early as 2020 by the CCS
standards body [16]. Resulting indicators of the user’s day-
to-day behaviour such as the vehicle’s state-of-charge and
projected departure time are contained within normal charg-
ing trafﬁc, while reverse power ﬂow data in a V2G system
yields insights into the power usage of the building.
In addition to internet access for in-vehicle entertainment
systems, third-party apps and alternative payment networks,
the trafﬁc of any local services would also be available at
public locations, as would smart home integration trafﬁc in
private ones.
9.3 Charging Attacks
A reliable eavesdropping capability presents a range of op-
portunities for an attacker, both immediate and longer-term
in their impact. We consider here a selection of potential
attacks using these techniques. Although we did not per-
form the attacks against public chargers, we describe how
they would be conducted.
AutoCharge Extant AutoCharge systems, such as one op-
erating in production across a 60-location network in three
European countries [33] are at particular risk from wireless
eavesdropping. The use of the vehicle’s charge-controller
MAC address for billing identiﬁcation [58, 56], while highly
questionable from a purely-security standpoint, was under-
taken for compatibility and convenience beneﬁts (and has
been lauded as such by customers). What may be an ac-
ceptable trade-off when physical interference is required to
extract the values, is far less so when this can be done from
