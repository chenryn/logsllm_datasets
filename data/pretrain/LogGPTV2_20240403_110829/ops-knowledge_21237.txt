I am currently using Aptana Studio 3, build: 3.0.4.201108101506. When I attempt to check for updates, I receive the following error message: "A Problem occurred" with the additional information: "No repository found at file:/C:/Users/Keith/AppData/Local/Aptana%20Studio%203/plugins/com.python.pydev_2.2.1.2011073123/."

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

It appears that the specified filepath is configured as an update site in your preferences. This seems to be invalid, possibly because you installed a PyDev zip from this location. To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:

1. Open Aptana Studio.
2. Go to **Preferences**.
3. Navigate to **Install/Update > Available Software Sites**.
4. Locate and remove the entry for the problematic filepath.

This should resolve the update check error.
