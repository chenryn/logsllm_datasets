6.5 Density of Special Interest Groups
In a variety of complex networks, e.g. on-line social net-
works, each vertex (user) is associated with multiple labels
that represent group aﬃliations, e.g. user interests, user ge-
olocation, among others. For example, in the Flickr graph
21% of the users belong to one or more special interest
groups [26]. Let L denote the set of groups in the Flickr
graph and θl denote the fraction of vertices that belong to
group l ∈ L.
In the simulations we estimate θl using FS
(m = 100), SingleRW, and MultipleRW (m = 100) with
budget B = |V |/100. Figure 14 shows the NMSE (from
10, 000 runs) of the most popular 200 groups ordered in de-
creasing popularity. FS is clearly superior to both SingleRW
and MultipleRW. Even when restricting the random walks
to the largest connected component, FS still noticeably out-
performs MultipleRW (m = 100) and SingleRW.

6.6 Global Clustering Coefﬁcient Estimates
In our last set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy
of estimating the global clustering coeﬃcient using FS, Sin-
gleRW, and MultipleRW. Our simulations show a small dif-
ference between FS (m = 1000), SingleRW, MultipleRW
(m = 1000). Let C be the clustering coeﬃcient and ˆC de-
note its estimated value. Table 3 presents the empirical
value of E[ ˆC] and the empirical NMSE of the clustering co-
eﬃcient, given by
NMSE = pE[( ˆC − C)2]
C
,
over 10, 000 runs of FS, SingleRW, and MultipleRW over the
Flickr and Livejournal graphs. From the results of Table 3
we see that FS accurately estimates the global clustering
coeﬃcient and has smaller error than both SingleRW and
MultipleRW.
7. RELATED WORK
This section is devoted to review the related literature. FS
can be classiﬁed as a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method. Other MCMC-based methods have been applied to
characterize complex networks. Applications include, but
are not limited to estimating characteristics of a popula-
tion [36] (e.g. estimation of HIV seroprevalence among drug
users [24]), content density in peer-to-peer networks [16, 23,
29, 35], uniformly sampling Web pages from the Internet [17,
33], and uniformly sampling Web pages from a search en-
gine’s index [4]. The above literature is mostly concerned
with random walks that seek to sample vertices uniformly
(also known as Metropolized Random Walks or Metropolis-
RW) [16, 17, 33, 4, 35]. The accuracy of RW and Metropolis-
RW (MRW) is compared in [15, 29], and in a variety of ex-
periments RW estimates are shown to be consistently more
accurate than or equal to MRW estimates.
The above literature does not consider the use of mul-
tiple random walks to address the problem of estimating
characteristics of disconnected or loosely connected graphs.
While multiple independent random walkers have been used
as a convergence test in the literature, our simulations in
Section 6 show that independent walkers are not suited to
sample loosely connected graphs when the starting vertices
are selected uniformly at random.
A number of real complex networks are known to have dis-
connected or loosely connected components. A large body
of MCMC literature is dedicated to overcome the locality
problem described in Section 4.3. However, the literature
either assumes that the graph is very structured, e.g., a 2
dimensional lattice, or that the graph is completely known.
These assumptions make the solutions inapplicable to our
problem. A comprehensive list of MCMC methods and their
characteristics can be found in [32].
Projecting a RW onto a higher dimensional space has been
used in [9] to make the Markov chain associated to the ran-
dom walker nonreversible, which can speed up the mixing of
the original RW. Unfortunately, it is unclear if this method
can be successfully used to estimate characteristics of com-
plex networks.
In networks that cannot be crawled (e.g., the Internet
topology), samples must be obtained along shortest paths,
and vertex degrees cannot be queried, [1] shows that ob-
served vertex degrees are biased. Our work, however, as-
sumes a graph can be crawled and vertex degrees queried.
Our scenario admits a RW with an unbiased estimator. Mul-
tiple random walks also ﬁnd other applications besides the
one presented in this work. They are used to collect Web
data [10], search P2P networks [6, 38], and decrease the time
to discover “new wireless nodes” [2]. Dependent multiple
random walks are also used in percolation theory [3].
8. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work we presented a new and promising random
walk-based method (Frontier sampling) that mitigates the
estimation errors caused by subgraphs that “trap” a random
walker. Frontier sampling (FS) uses multiple (m) mutually
dependent random walkers starting from vertices sampled
uniformly at random. The FS samples are shown to be the
projection (onto the original graph) of a special type of m-
dimensional (single) random walker. Simulations over real
world graphs in Section 6 show that Frontier sampling (FS)
is more robust than single and multiple independent random
walkers (starting out of steady state) to estimate in-degree
distributions and the fraction of users that belong to a so-
cial group. We also present evidence, using an analytical
argument (also substantiated by simulations), that random
walks (in particular, FS) are better suited to estimate the
tail (all degrees greater than the average) of degree distri-
butions than random vertex sampling. FS can also be made
fully distributed without incurring in any coordination or
communication costs.
The ideas behind FS can have far reaching implications,
from estimating characteristics of dynamic networks to the
design of new MCMC-based approximation algorithms.
