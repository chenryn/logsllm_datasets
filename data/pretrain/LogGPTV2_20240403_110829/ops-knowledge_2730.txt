User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Exchange 2010 oversized mail notification Earlier we have Exchange 2003. In exchange 2003 when set the maximum size of sending / receiving mail, we can set an e-mail address where we see a notice if we have an undeliverable mail.

Now we changed our servers, and our Exchange 2010 we can't find where should be set this up?!

Now if someone send us an oversized mail, we can't see anything. In the message tracking log i can see the ndr about the oversized mail, but i would like to set an administrator mail address to get this notifications too.

Is it possible somehow?

Thank you

Assistant: You have to configure external postmaster address. For details, see this article
