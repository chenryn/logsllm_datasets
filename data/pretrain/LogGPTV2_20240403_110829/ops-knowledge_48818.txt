User: I was trying to install cx_Freeze module and it gives me the could not locate network location error along with a non existent path name(supposedly pointing to python? but it wasnt). Then I tried installing another module py2exe, this time the installer was a bit more user friendly and informed that I got two mentions of Python in my registry. One pointing to the correct Python directory, the other pointing to the same wrong one.
My question is how or is it possible to delete the wrong mention of Python from my registry or another way around it? I wanted to install cx_Freeze. Thanks
Assistant: I just resolved it but not sure if this is the right way to go about it. Here's what I did,
In the cmd box, type regedit, and then click OK you will have the Registry editor. 
Right Clicked on the key name  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and searched for the wrong path name that kept showing up. In a few seconds it will take you to the location of that path in the registry. I did see two mentions of Python. Wasn't hard to figure out the wrong one(incorrect path) and deleted it without any side effects. 
Immediately after this I was able to install the modules perfectly.
