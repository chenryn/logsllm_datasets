The master documentation says the following about the entity form type:
> The class of your entity (e.g. AcmeStoreBundle:Category). This can be a
> fully-qualified class name (e.g. Acme\StoreBundle\Entity\Category) or the
> short alias name (as shown prior).
However, the `Bundle:Entity` syntax throws the following exception:
> Class Bundle:Entity does not exist
I've downloaded the symfony-standard edition and made the following test, just
to be sure the problem is not caused by my project.
    namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Entity;
    class Smartie
    {
        private $smarties = array('red', 'green', 'yellow', 'brown');
        public function getSmarties()
        {
            return $this->smarties;
        }
    }
    namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Form;
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder->add('yummie', 'entity', array(
            'class' => 'AcmeDemoBundle:Smartie',
            'property' => 'smarties'
        ));
    }
    {{ form_widget(form.yummie) }}
And that throws the following exception:
> Class AcmeDemoBundle:Smartie does not exist  
>
> vendor/doctrine/common/lib/Doctrine/Common/Persistence/AbstractManagerRegistry.php
> at line 158  
>  $proxyClass = new \ReflectionClass($class);
Maybe something has changed due the latest form improvements, I don't know.
Either it's a bug or the documentation needs a update.
