Sorry if this issue exists already, I searched but couldn't find anything.
**Issue:** Currently I have atom 0.123.0 installed on windows 8. If I launch
atom from the start menu, Help>Version shows 0.123.0. If I launch atom by
opening a file from Windows Explorer, Help>Version shows 0.115.0. This may be
the first version of atom I installed, but I think it was a few versions
before that (110-113, I'd guess).  
**Expected Behavior:** Regardless of how atom launches, the most current
version should launch.  
**Attempted Solutions:** I've tried telling windows to Open With atom from a
few different locations, including the shim in /ProgramData/chocolatey/, and
the shortcut on the start menu, which I know launches the right version.
Any assistance is appreciated. I'm currently in between projects, so I am not
writing much code, so I don't mind trying any suggestions, debug, etc, even if
it kills things for a little bit.
