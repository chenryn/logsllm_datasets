I started having trouble with a site I have in development that uses Joomla
3.1.5 with Bootstrap (meet gavern template) under IE10 on Win7 Ultimate. So I
tried opening the getbootstrap site under IE10 and it also has big issues
(attached). The home page loads the background, a couple text fields and
nothing else, and when I go to getbootstrap.com/components I get this error in
the console:SCRIPT87: Invalid argument. holder.js, line 119 character 4.
If I go to getbootstrap.com/2.3.2, I get this error: SCRIPT5002: Function
expected  
holder.js, line 316 character 2.
IE10 goes into compatibility mode with IE7 Standards Document Mode when the
page loads. Some pages display blank white - even though all the code has
loaded if I call up the view source window - and then if I resize the window
it goes black.
I have an NVIDIA GeForce Display, not one of the displays with known issues
for IE10. There is another person on the Joomla forum who has this issue so I
know it is not just my computer. It seems to be ie10 and Windows Ultimate.
