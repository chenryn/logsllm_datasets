I am currently experiencing issues with a site I am developing that uses Joomla 3.1.5 and the Gavern template, which is based on Bootstrap. The problem occurs specifically in Internet Explorer 10 (IE10) on Windows 7 Ultimate.

To troubleshoot, I tried accessing the official getbootstrap.com website using IE10, and it also exhibited significant problems. The homepage only loads the background and a few text fields, but no other content. When I navigate to the "Components" page, the following error appears in the console: **SCRIPT87: Invalid argument.** This error is located in `holder.js` at line 119, character 4.

Additionally, when I visit the older version of the Bootstrap site (`getbootstrap.com/2.3.2`), I encounter another error: **SCRIPT5002: Function expected.** This error is found in `holder.js` at line 316, character 2.

Upon further investigation, I noticed that IE10 automatically switches to Compatibility View, using the IE7 Standards Document Mode when loading these pages. Some pages appear as blank white screens, even though the source code is fully loaded. Resizing the browser window causes the screen to turn black.

My system uses an NVIDIA GeForce display, which is not one of the known problematic displays for IE10. Another user on the Joomla forum has reported the same issue, indicating that it is not specific to my setup. It seems to be a problem related to IE10 and Windows 7 Ultimate.

Here is a screenshot of the issue:
