Security 3rd. Here, a doomed AS has a path to m with
(1) better LP OR (2) equal LP and shorter length SP,
than every available path to d. The opposite holds for an
immune AS. A protectable AS has best available routes to
m and d with equal LP and path length SP.
4.4 Bounding security for all deployments.
For each routing model, we found the fraction of doomed/
protectable / immune source ASes for each attacker destina-
tion pair (m, d), and took the average over all (m, d) ∈ V ×V .
We used these values to get upper- and lower bounds on
HV,V (S) for all deployments S, for each routing model.
Figure 3: The colored parts of each bar represent the av-
erage fraction of immune, protectable, and doomed source
ASes, averaged over all O(|V |2) possible pairs of attackers
and destinations. Since HV,V (S) is an average of the frac-
tion of happy source ASes over all pairs of attackers and
destinations, the upper bound on the metric HV,V (S) ∀S is
the average fraction of source ASes that are not doomed.
The upper bound on the metric HV,V (S) ∀S is therefore:
≈ 100% with security 1st, 89% with security 2nd, and 75%
with security 3rd. (The same ﬁgure computed on our IXP-
edge-augmented graph looks almost exactly the same, with
the proportions being ≈ 100%, 90% and 77%.) Meanwhile,
the heavy solid line is the lower bound on the metric HV,V (∅)
in the baseline setting where S = ∅ and there is only origin
authentication; in Section 4.2 we found that HV,V (∅) = 60%
(and 62% for the IXP-edge-augmented graph). Therefore,
we can bound the maximum change in our security metric
HV,V (S) ∀S for each routing policy model by computing the
distance between the solid line and the boundary between
the fraction of doomed and protectable ASes. We ﬁnd:
Security 3rd: Little improvement. Figure 3 shows that
the maximum gains over origin authentication that are pro-
vided by the security 3rd model are quite slim — at most
15% — regardless of which ASes are secure. (This follows
because the upper bound on the metric HV,V (S) ≤ 75%
for any S while the lower bound on the baseline setting is
HV,V (∅) ≥ 60%.) Moreover, these are the maximum gains
∀S; in a realistic S*BGP deployment, the gains are likely to
be much smaller. This result is disappointing, since the secu-
rity 3rd model is likely to be the most preferred by network

operators (Section 2.2.3), but it is not especially surprising.
S*BGP is designed to prevent path shortening attacks; how-
ever, in the security 3rd model ASes prefer short (possibly
bogus) insecure routes over a long secure routes, so it is nat-
ural that this model realizes only minimal security beneﬁts.
Security 2nd: More improvement. Meanwhile, route
security is prioritized above route length with the security 2nd
model, so we could hope for better security beneﬁts. Indeed,
Figure 3 conﬁrms that the maximum gains over origin au-
thentication are better: 89− 60 = 29%. But can these gains
be realized in realistic partial-deployment scenarios? We
answer this in question in Section 5.
Decreasing numbers of immune ASes? The fraction
of immune ASes in the security 2nd (12%) and 1st (≈ 0%)
models is (strangely) lower than the fraction of happy ASes
in the baseline scenario (60%). How is this possible? In
Section 6.1.1 we explain this counterintuitive observation by
showing that more secure ASes can sometimes result in less
happy ASes; these “collateral damages”, that occur only in
the security 1st and 2nd models, account for the decrease in
the number of immune ASes.
4.5 Robustness to destination tier.
Thus far, we have been averaging our results over all pos-
sible attacker-destination pairs in the graph. However, some
destination ASes might be particularly important to secure,
perhaps because they source important content (e.g., the
content provider ASes (CPs)) or transit large volumes of
traﬃc (the Tier 1 ASes). As such, we broke down the met-
ric over destinations in each tier in Table 1.
Figure 4. We show the partitioning into immune / pro-
tectable / doomed ASes in the security 3rd model, but this
time averaged individually over all destinations in each tier,
and all possible attackers V . The thick horizontal line over
each vertical bar again shows the corresponding lower bound
on our metric HV,Tier(∅) when no AS is secure. Apart from
the Tier 1s (discussed next), we observe similar trends as in
Section 4.4, with the improvement in security ranging from
8 − 15% for all tiers; the same holds for the security 2nd
model, shown in Figure 5.
4.6
It’s difﬁcult to protect Tier 1 destinations.
Strangely enough, Figure 4 shows that when Tier 1 des-
tinations are attacked in the security 3rd model, the vast
