Files copied to '/static' using CopyWebpackPlugin are successfully created,
but then are deleted right after the console messages 'Building page ...'.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Files copied by CopyWebpackPlugin to '/static' don't subsequently get removed
by the build process.
## Current Behavior
Files copied by CopyWebpackPlugin to '/static' get copied, then deleted by the
build process.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Run `npm run dev` with the following next.config.js (note that I'm copying a
file from the `workbox-sw` npm package, but it can be any file):
    const path = require('path')
    const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')
    module.exports = {
      webpack: (config, { dev }) => {
        config.plugins.push(
          new CopyWebpackPlugin([
          {
            from: path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules/workbox-sw/build/importScripts/workbox-sw.dev.v2.1.2.js'),
            to: path.join(__dirname, 'static/scripts/workbox.js')
          }
        ]))
        return config
      }
    }
## Context
Can't copy files at build time.
