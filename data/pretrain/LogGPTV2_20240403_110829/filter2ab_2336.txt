**ATT&CK ID:** C0024  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SolarWinds Compromise

In the context of the SolarWinds compromise, APT29 (also known as Cozy Bear) carried out credential theft operations to acquire credentials that would enable access to victim environments. [16]

This operation involved sophisticated tactics to infiltrate and exfiltrate sensitive information, leveraging the compromised SolarWinds Orion software updates to gain a foothold in the targeted networks. The stolen credentials were then used to further penetrate and maintain persistence within these environments.
