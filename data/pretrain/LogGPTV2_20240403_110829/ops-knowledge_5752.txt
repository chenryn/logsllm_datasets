**Subject: Seeking Guidance on Posting Text Data from App Inventor to App Engine**

Hello,

I am new to this and would greatly appreciate some assistance. I am currently working with App Inventor and App Engine, and I am learning Python as I go. Here's what I need help with:

I want to post text data from App Inventor to App Engine, save it in the Blob Store as an XML file, and then email it as an attachment.

So far, I have been able to send pictures using Shival Wolf's `wolfwebmail2` code. I believe that with some modifications, I can adapt this code to save the posted text as a file in the Blob Store and perform the same operation for sending it as an attachment.

As a beginner, I am learning quickly, but any guidance or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

**Update:**

After further exploration, I found a solution that works for me. Instead of modifying Shival Wolf's code on the App Engine side, I replaced the 'postfile' block in the App Inventor code with a 'posttext' block. I attached the text I want to send to this block and updated the filename variable to include the desired file name and extension (e.g., `.xml`, `.csv`, `.txt`, etc.).

This approach seems to work for my needs. 

Thank you in advance for any additional advice or feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
