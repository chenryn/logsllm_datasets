V.  CORRECTNESS ANALYSIS 
The  Receiver  can  decrypt 
the  obtained  ciphertext 
correctly. According to the format retention requirement, the 
message  format  remains  unchanged  before  and  after 
encryption,  that  is,  the  key  K  calculated  by  Sender  and 
Receiver is consistent. 
Proof:  The  decryption  key  calculated  by  Receiver 
Proof:  Without  loss  of  generality,  suppose  A  does  not 
repeat the previous query. We first reduce the PRP security 
of  KDF  to  the  PRP  security  of  FPE  by  constructing  an 
attacker  B. Adversary B runs A. When the latter queries the 
identity  ID,  the  former  queries 
  for  its

VIII.  CONCLUSION 
Format-preserving  encryption  can  not  only  ensure  the 
confidentiality  of  the  message,  but  also  the  data  length  and 
data  format  remain  unchanged  before  and  after  encryption, 
reducing  the  cost  of  reforming  the  data  format.  This  paper 
designs  a  scheme  of  hybrid  encryption  environment  based 
on  an  identity-based  format-preserving  encryption  scheme. 
This  scheme  combines  the  advantages  of  identity-based 
public  key  encryption  and  format-preserving  encryption. 
Able  to  encrypt  the  transmission  of  sensitive  information 
and ensure that the format does not change before and after 
encryption.  At  the  same  time,  communication  security  is 
improved  and  related  facilities  of  the  key  management 
system  are  reduced.  The  proposed  scheme  guarantees  the 
identity-based  PRP  security  and  meets  the  IND-ID-CPA 
security.
