5 Conclusion
In this paper we propose a framework for detecting diseased plants leaf with
very low computing resource needed based on Kernel KMeans method to offer
an Edge AI service for Leaf Plant Disease detection. AI-Service Segment selects
kernel images that have core characteristics of diseased leaf (Kernel Images),
use K Means machine learning algorithm to build clusters of Kernel-Images
so that diseased regions are one cluster. We call the resulting models KMeans
Kernel-Model. These models are deployed to the AI-IoT Nodes that use them
to analyze the stream of pictures that comes from the camera sensor. When we
evaluate our proposal, we note an accuracy of 96% of our system. The proposed
method efficiently detects and classifies plant disease and could be applied to
the detection and classification of several types of plants. We also compare it to
other works and it give quite good results while needing less computation and
images in the dataset. Future work in this study will focus on improving our
algorithm by using Light Weighted KNN or Random Forest.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, the smart physical devices are part of the everyday people life and
generate huge amount of data, which drives applications and services on top of
them, establishing the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem [1]. Applications are
developed to ingest, store and analyze large amounts of data generated by the
IoT devices in all economic sectors such as transportation, agriculture, health
andeducation.AccordingtoCISCOInternetBusinessSolutionsGroup(CISCO
IBSG ), the total number of interconnected devices by 2015 was 25 billions and
it’sexpectedtobe50billionby2020[2].Forthesametimeperioditisexpected
5.8billionIoTendpointsandglobaleconomicrevenuefromendpointelectronics
to total 389 billion US dollars.
One of the most impacted sectors by the IoT is the automotive industry.
Recently, tens of millions of cars are said to be connected to the Internet and
their number is expected to become hundreds of millions in the near future.

Accordingtoaglobalindustryanalysis,thenumberofconnectedvehicleswill
become 125 million by 2022. In order to enable such a massive amount of con-
nected vehicles to communicate with other IoT endpoints in real time, new net-
work bridges and protocols are developed [3]. At the same time, mobile network

The current hardware and software solutions for tracking vehicles give evi-
dence for the efforts of using IoT technologies in automotive industry. Geotab
provides a service for monitoring and analysis of vehicles using integrated hard-
ware module that sends data to private cloud. The hardware module is con-
nected to the onboard diagnostic bus of the vehicle and collects data about
fuel consumption, traveled distance and other parameters. The data analysis,
which is made in the cloud allows identification of vehicles with not optimal
fuelconsumption.Unfortunately,Geotabsolutiondoesnotdetectincreasedrate
of carbon emissions and provide control over vehicle’s parameters. Madgetech
is a data logger, which provides functionality for regular monitoring of carbon
dioxide levels (Data Loggers). It measures the carbon emissions by exhaust gas
sensors in vehicles and sends data to private cloud. The measured data is visu-
alized by mobile application, but analysis and control of the carbon emissions
are not supported. In addition to these existing solutions, there are mandatory
emissions inspection and certification procedures in many countries. But these
procedures usually are done only one or several times per year, which is a small
frequency and can not guarantee that the vehicles are working with optimal
emissions for big period of time.
Inspired by the low-carbon roadmap of European union and the grate
potential provided by the IoT technologies for reducing the carbon emissions,
in this paper we propose a solution for real-time monitoring and detection
of rising levels of carbon emissions from vehicles, called EcoLogic. The pro-
posed solution includes hardware module, which collects sensor data related
to vehicle’s carbon emissions such as air pressure, air temperature and fuel
mixture. The data is transferred to a cloud-based applications, where it’s
stored and analysed. The results from the analysis are used to control the
carbon emissions through driver notifications and vehicle’s power limitations.
The source code of the main software components of the solution is publicly
available and can be accessed and downloaded from the following locations:

and extended by everyone who is interested to track and reduce emissions at
global scale. Additionally the system can be integrated with the countries tax
system supporting drivers with small emissions footprint to pay smaller taxes.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section2 presents the architec-
ture of EcoLogic with its components, interconnections and protocols. Section3

nologiesareused.Section4showsacasestudythatvalidatesthefeasibilityofthe

test dataset and real dataset. Finally, Sect.5 concludes our research by giving
the pros and cons of the system and points out directions for future work.
2 System Design
This section presents the architecture of EcoLogic system with its components,
communication paths and protocols.
The EcoLogic system is composed of two big parts: hardware modules and
cloud-native microservice applications. The hardware modules are located in
vehiclesandthemicroserviceapplicationsaredeployedonacloudplatform.The
architecture of the system is shown in Fig.1. The history of physical computing
technology showed us that each physical computing system contains at least
one hardware device, but nowadays the Internet of Things paradigm, which
extends the physical computing technology, is showing us that except hardware
devices each IoT system should use also Cloud or Fog platform, which enables
massive scale, reliability and efficiency. It becomes a standard for IoT systems
to incorporate Cloud and Fog computing platforms in its architectures [5] as
main components that give a lot of benefits like enormous computing power for
artificial intelligence algorithms, including machine learning and data mining,
high availability, disaster recovery, big storage and near real-time speeds.
Thehardwaremoduleofthesystemhassensorsandmeasuresseveralphysical
parameters. It can also extract parameters from the onboard diagnostic system
ofthevehicle.Thedataissenttocloud-nativeapplicationsinthecloudplatform.
The measured physical parameters are:
Air/fuel ratio,whichismeasuredbylambdasondesensor,whichislocated
into the exhaust system of the vehicle.
 Absolute pressure of the air that is consumed by the engine, which is mea-
sured by sensor located in the air intake manifold of the vehicle.
 Temperature of the air that is consumed by the engine, which is measured
by sensor located in the air intake manifold of the vehicle.
The cloud-native applications are implemented as microservices, which are
designed in a platform agnostic way in order to have the possibility for
deployment on different cloud platforms. The cloud applications store data in a
relationaldatabase,whichisrepresentedbybackingservicefromthecloudplat-
form. They process the incoming data, store it into the database and analyse it.
System for Monitoring and Control of Vehicle’s Carbon Emissions 567
Fig.1. EcoLogic general architecture
The hardware modules communicate with the cloud with wireless network via
HTTPS or MQTT protocols. The following physical parameters are calculated
on top of the incoming sensor data:
 Mass of the consumed air by the engine;
 Mass of the consumed fuel by the engine;
 Mass of the carbon dioxide emissions, exposed into the atmosphere.
The database contains all measured and calculated physical parameters.
A cloud-native Analytics application executes an anomaly detection on the
streamed data and outlines vehicles that have not optimal amount of carbon
dioxide emissions or system failures. Clustering analysis is made in order to
detectanomalies.Thehardwaremoduleisnotifiedwhensomevehicleisdetected
by the system as an anomaly, with suboptimal amount of emissions. Then the
hardware actuator is started automatically to reduce the amount of emissions.
This comprises a feedback control loop. In this way the system monitors and
controls the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere in real time.
The hardware modules are equipped with three actuators:
 Liquid crystal display (LCD), which visualize the measured and calculated
physical parameters to the driver.
 Light-emitting diode (LED), which indicates to the driver that the amount
of carbon dioxide emissions is not optimal or there is a system failure (not
optimal parameters).
 Actuator, which controls the amount of injected fuel in the engine and
regulates the amount of emissions.
Currently, only the display and LED actuator are implemented in the Eco-
Logic. The purpose of the LED actuator is to notify the driver to intentionally
reduce the acceleration and change the driving behaviour, which leads to reduc-
tion of the amount of burned fuel and emissions.

The cloud applications provide web user interface, on the base of HTML5,
JavaScript and CSS resources. It’s endpoint is publicly available and accessible
by clients via HTTPS protocol.
The user management of the system is composed of two roles: driver and
operator. The lifecycle of the system is the following:
 Dealer sells a hardware module to a driver.
Thedriverinstalls thehardwaremoduleinto vehicle.This stepcanalsobe
accomplished by an authorized service.
 The driver registers the vehicle with the hardware module and sensors via
the web user interface. All components have unique identifiers.
Driversareauthorizedtomonitorandcontroltheirownregisteredvehicles.
 Operators are authorized to monitor and control all registered vehicles by
regions.
Eachdrivergetsscorepointsproportionaltotheamountofcarbondioxide
emissions exposed in the atmosphere from their vehicles.
 The score points can be integrated with tax systems of countries and city
halls. In this way the taxes can be reduced proportionally to the score points.
