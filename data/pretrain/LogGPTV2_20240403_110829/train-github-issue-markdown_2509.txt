### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.33.0]
  * Operating System: [Multiple]
  * Browser: [Chromium]
  * Other info: PW runs under docker official image, tried mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.33.0 and mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.32.0-focal - same result
  * Env: Node.js 17
**This may be important:** I use PW browser remote connection, PW and Chromium
are in PW's image docker container and another docker container based on
node:17-alpine image connects to it and performs RPA actions
### Source code (partial)
    const closeModalButtonLocator: Locator = page.locator('[data-automation-id="ModalDialog"] [aria-label="Close"]');
    if (await closeModalButtonLocator.isVisible()) {
      const notShowButtonLocator: Locator = page.locator(
        '[data-automation-id="ModalDialog"] button >> text=Don\'t show me this again'
      );
      if (await notShowButtonLocator.isVisible()) {
        await notShowButtonLocator.click({ force: true, timeout: this.config.longActionTimeout });
      } else {
        await closeModalButtonLocator.click({ force: true, timeout: this.config.longActionTimeout });
      }
    }
**Expected**
await locator.isVisible() should return boolean value immediately
**Actual**
await locator.isVisible() throws exception Timeout 5000ms exceeded, but it
shouldn't wait for anything and should just return element is visible or not.
it sometimes happens in different places where isVisible are used, regardless
of element actually visible or not

P.S can't publish all source code or full trace, but last error action
screenshot from trace viewer is representative, i suppose
