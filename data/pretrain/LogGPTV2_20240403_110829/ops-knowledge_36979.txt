User: Is there any quick way in Python to get the MAC address of the default gateway? 
I can't make any ARP requests from the Linux machine I'm running my code on, so it has to come directly from the ARP table.
Assistant: Are you using Linux? You could parse the /proc/net/arp file. It contains the HW address of your gateway.
