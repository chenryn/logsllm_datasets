ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we propose a new form of image-based CAPTCHA 
we  term  “scene  tagging”.  It  tests  the  ability  to  recognize  a 
relationship  between  multiple  objects  in  an  image  that  is 
automatically  generated  via  composition of a background image 
with  multiple  irregularly  shaped  object  images,  resulting  in  a 
large space of possible images and questions without requiring a 
large  object  database.  This  composition  process  is  accompanied 
by a carefully designed sequence of systematic image distortions 
that  makes  it  difficult  for  automated  attacks  to  locate/identify 
objects  present.  Automated  attacks  must  recognize  all  or  most 
objects  contained  in  the  image  in  order  to  answer  a  question 
correctly,  thus  the  proposed  approach  reduces  attack  success 
rates.  An  experimental  study  using  several  widely-used  object 
recognition  algorithms  (PWD-based  template  matching,  SIFT, 
SURF) shows that the system is resistant to these attacks with a 
2%  attack  success  rate,  while  a  user  study  shows  that  the  task 
required can be performed by average users with a 97% success 
rate.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
A number of abuses of Internet services are only made possible 
by  the  use  of  automated  programs,  such  as  the  mass  posting  of 
spam  to  comment  sections  and  user  forums,  mass  user  account 
registration,  brute  force  password  attacks,  and  abuse  of  online 
polls. To prevent such abuses, services may require a user to pass 
a  CAPTCHA  [1]  (Computer  Automated  Turing  Test  for  telling 
Computers and Humans Apart), a challenge-response test that can 
be  easily  solved  by  human  users  but  is  extremely  difficult  for 
computer  programs  and,  hence,  determines  whether  a  service

request originated from a human or an automated program. Such 
test  systems  are  now  in  wide  use  on  the  Internet,  and  play  a 
critical role in ensuring the integrity of many of the most popular 
websites. In order to be effective in this role, it is important that 
CAPTCHAs are strongly resistant to automated attacks and at the 
same time do not cause problems for human users. 
Text-based  CAPTCHAs,  in  which  users  are  required  to 
transcribe  text  presented  in  a  distorted  image,  make  up  the 
majority of CAPTCHA systems in real-world use. However, their 
vulnerability  to  attack  has  been  repeatedly  demonstrated  by 
computer  vision  researchers  [5,  15,  17].  For  example,  several 
commercial  CAPTCHA  implementations  were  attacked  in  2004 
by  Microsoft  researchers  with  80%-95%  success  rates  achieved 
[5]. To guard against these automated attacks, stronger and more 
elaborate distortions have been utilized in creating images used by 
text-based  CAPTCHAs;  this,  however,  greatly  impairs  human 
legibility, resulting in higher user error rates [18] and associated 
levels of user frustration. As the advance of character recognition 
algorithms  continue 
the  attack  capabilities  of 
automated programs, human legibility problems will likely make 
text-based CAPTCHAs less effective in the future.

Because  CAPTCHA  systems  are  so  important  to  the  modern 
Internet,  the  need  for  investigation  of  alternative  CAPTCHA 
formats is clear. Facing this challenge, in recent years researchers 
have begun to develop image-based CAPTCHA systems [2, 6, 7, 
9, 11]. These typically require the user to identify the subject of 
an image, which is generally considered to be a significantly more 
difficult  task  to  automate  than  that  of  distorted  character 
recognition.  In  addition,  user  studies  we  have  conducted  have 
suggested that image-based CAPTCHAs are largely preferred by 
users over text-based CAPTCHAs for reasons such as ease of use 
and a preference for a mouse-based response format. However, it 
may be argued that the proposed systems have not been able to 
satisfactorily  address  the  difficulties  associated  with  creating  a 
large, correctly tagged image database and that their security has 
not  been  demonstrated  against  sufficiently  advanced  automated 
attack methods. 
We  propose  a  novel  form  of  image-based  CAPTCHA  that  we 
term  “scene  tagging”.  Rather  than  asking  a  user  to  identify  the 
subject of an image, a scene tagging problem consists of multiple 
object  images  composed  with  a  background  image  into  a  single 
scene  and  tasks  the  user  with  understanding  a  relationship 
between  several  of  the  objects  present.  The  advantages  of  this 
approach are:   
•   Answering a question correctly requires successful recognition 
of all or most of the present image objects in the relationship to 
which  this  question  refers.  This  poses  a  more  difficult  task  to 
attackers than that of the image-matching required in a number of 
proposed image-based CAPTCHAs.

•   A number of other systems are vulnerable to attacks based on 
image  similarity  metrics  if  the  source  image  database  is  known 
and  not  sufficiently  large.  The  combination  and  composition-
based nature of the images generated by our system results in an 
extremely large space of possible images without requiring a large 
image  database,  even  before  considering  image  distortion.  This 
minimizes  the  difficulty  associated  with  building  a  large, 
correctly tagged image database by making more effective use of 
an image database of a relatively small size.  
•   The relationship-based format of the questions results in many 
possible  questions  for  a  given  image.  This  allows  multiple 
questions  to  be  asked  of  a  user  without  incurring  an  additional 
bandwidth cost. 
•   A carefully designed sequence of systematic image distortion 
and clutter is performed during the image composition process in 
order  to  make  it  extremely  difficult  for  automated  attacks  to 
determine  the  quantity,  identity,  and  location  of  the  objects 
present  amongst 
image 
information. Extensive user testing has been used in the design of 
this  sequence  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  impact  upon  human 
performance is relatively minor. 
•      Experimental  and  user  study  results  show  that  the  system 
presents a task that is strongly resistant to a number of state-of-
the-art automated machine vision-based attacks, yet can be easily 
solved by the average user.

2.  RELATED WORK 
A number of CAPTCHA systems based upon the understanding 
of  semantic  image  content  have  been  proposed.  Many  early 
image-based CAPTCHA systems simply ask the user to identify 
the  subject  of  an  image  or  a  subject  associated  with  a  set  of 
images.  However,  resistance  to  image-similarity  based  attacks 
requires the creation and maintenance of a large, correctly labeled 
image  database  –  a  task  that  is  labor  intensive  and  fraught with 
legal  issues  regarding  usage.  Approaches  to  dealing  with  this 
shortcoming  include  the  sourcing  of  images  from  image  search 
engines [6]; however, the manner in which image search engines 
tag  images  may  result  in  mislabeled  or  potentially  offensive 
results. Microsoft’s Asirra [9] asks users to identify the images of 
cats  out  of  a  set  of  photographs  of  cats  and  dogs,  sourced 
dynamically  from  a  frequently  updated  pet  adoption  website. 
However,  a  successful  machine  learning  attack  [10]  has  been 
demonstrated against the system, a success that largely appears to 
be  a  result  of  the  binary  nature  of  the  classification  problem 
posed. The composition-based nature of our system largely avoids 
image  database  creation  problems  by  generating  an  extremely 
large space of possible test images and associated questions from 
a relatively small database size. 
Implicit  CAPTCHAs  [2]  tasks  the  user  with  semantically 
understanding the objects present in an image. A problem with the 
system  is  that  it  requires  significant  manual  labor  in  the 
annotation  of  images  and  creation  of  challenges,  while  our 
approach  does  not  require  manual  annotation  of  images  or 
creation of questions. A system named IMAGINATION [7] also 
utilizes  image  combination  and  distortion  in  generating  the 
images  presented  to  the  user.  Unlike  this  system,  our  approach 
utilizes  overlay-based  composition  of  irregularly  shaped  objects 
with  a  background  image,  utilizes  a  more  complex  sequence  of 
image  distortions  such  as  non-linear  image  transformation,  and 
tasks  the  user  with  understanding  the  relationships  between 
multiple  objects  in  an  image  rather  than  image  center  or  image 
subject identification. Researchers in the same group [8] attempt 
to  quantify  the  effect  of  distortions  on  human  and  machine 
recognition  of  image  subjects,  but  have  only  tested  with  non-
composed, single subject images. This is a different problem than 
that utilized by our proposed system, and thus testing a different 
set of automated attacks is appropriate. 
Google Research’s What’s Up CAPTCHA [11] requires users to 
identify an image’s proper upright orientation. One disadvantage 
of the system is that attackers may be able to build a pre-rotated 
image  database  given  a  known  image  database  and  then  utilize 
image  similarity  metrics  in  order  to  determine  correct  image 
rotations.  The  task’s  user  success  rate  when  the  images  have 
undergone distortion, the proposed defense, has not been tested. It 
is possible that usability would become a problem in this case. 
3.  SYSTEM OPERATION 
Scene  tagging  is  a  novel  form  of  attack-resistant  image-based 
CAPTCHA. It creates an image via composition of a background 
image  and  several  irregularly  shaped  object  images,  applying  a 
sequence of image distortions during this process, and asks a user 
to answer a series of questions based on the relationships between 
a  number  of  objects  in  the  image.  Figure  1  displays  a  sample 
image  used  in  our  proposed  system  to  which  no  distortion  has 
been applied. A question for such an image might be “Name the 
object  that  is  least  closely  related  to  the  other  objects  in  the 
image”, and the correct answer would be “ball”. Such a question 
requires identification of all or most objects in the image in order 
to answer correctly, posing a difficult task for automated attacks. 
3.1  Composite Image Creation 
In  order  to  create  a  test  CAPTCHA  image,  the  system  first 
randomly chooses a background image from the set of available 
backgrounds. It then performs the first round of image distortion, 
as described in a later section. Subsequently, a number of objects 
are  selected  from  the  object  database.  The  associated  object 
images are randomly placed over the distorted background image, 
with care taken to avoid overlapping of objects. Then, a second 
round  of  image  distortion  is  applied  to  this  composite  image  to
