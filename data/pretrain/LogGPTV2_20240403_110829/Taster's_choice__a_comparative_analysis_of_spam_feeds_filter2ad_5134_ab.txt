### MX Honeypots and Legitimate Correspondence
MX honeypots may inadvertently collect legitimate correspondence from the domain’s prior use. Generally, MX honeypots have a low rate of false positives, but since their accounts are not in active use, they primarily capture spam campaigns that are broadly targeted and high in volume. High-volume campaigns are easier to detect and are more likely to be rejected by anti-spam filters. As a result, some of the most prevalent spam in MX-based feeds may not frequently appear in Web mail or enterprise email inboxes.

### Seeded Honey Accounts
Similar to MX honeypots, seeded honey accounts capture unsolicited emails to accounts designed solely for receiving spam, which minimizes false positives. Unlike MX honeypots, however, honey accounts are created across various email providers, not limited to a few domains. These accounts must also be "seeded" across different vectors that spammers might use to harvest email addresses, such as forums, websites, and mailing lists. The quality of a honey account feed depends on both the number of accounts and how well they are seeded. The higher operational cost of creating and seeding these accounts means that researchers often obtain honey account spam feeds from third parties, typically commercial anti-spam providers.

Honey accounts share many limitations with MX-based feeds. Since the accounts are not active, they are unlikely to capture spam campaigns that target specific individuals using social network information or compromised mailing lists. Consequently, these feeds mainly include low-quality, high-volume campaigns that are more likely to be caught by anti-spam filters.

### Human-Identified Spam
Human-identified spam feeds consist of emails nominated as spam by users, usually through a built-in mail client interface (e.g., a "this is spam" button). Large webmail services provide such interfaces, making these datasets representative of human-based classification at a large scale. Due to this, human-identified spam feeds are not widely available and are often used by large webmail providers or their close collaborators.

Human-identified spam feeds can capture high-quality spam, as these messages have evaded automated filters. However, they may underrepresent high-volume campaigns, which are often pre-filtered before reaching a human. Additionally, individuals may have varying definitions of spam, leading to the inclusion of legitimate commercial emails. Temporal signals in human-identified spam feeds can also be distorted due to the time it takes for humans to identify spam.

### Domain Blacklists
Domain blacklists are the final category of spam-derived data and are the most opaque, as their collection methods are generally not publicly documented. Blacklists are meta-feeds driven by different combinations of spam source data, depending on the organization maintaining them. They are broadly available (often for a nominal fee) and professionally maintained. Unlike other feeds, blacklists represent domains in a binary fashion—either a domain is on the blacklist or it is not. While useful for identifying spam-advertised domains, they are less effective for investigating spam volume.

### False Positives
No spam source is entirely free of false positives. In addition to feed-specific biases, there are several reasons why a domain name in a spam feed may not be related to spam. For example, legitimate messages can be inadvertently mixed into the data stream due to typos or dummy email addresses. Another major source of feed pollution is chaff domains: legitimate domains that co-occur in spam messages, either to undermine filters or to support the message itself.

### Summary of Spam Domain Sources
Table 1 summarizes the spam domain sources (feeds) used in this study, including their types and the number of unique registered domain names.

| Feed Type | Domains | Unique |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Hu        | 10,733,231 | n/a    |
| dbl       | 32,548,304 | n/a    |
| uribl     | 198,871,030 | n/a    |
| mx1       | 12,517,244 | 30,991,248 |
| mx2       | 73,614,895 | 158,038,776 |
| mx3       | 451,603,575 | 1,051,211   |
| Ac1       | 144,758   | 413,392     |
| Ac2       | 100,631   | 2,127,164   |
| Bot       | 67,856    | 79,040      |
| Hyb       | 35,506    | 13,588,727  |

### Analysis
To better understand the differences among sources of spam domains, we consider four qualities: purity, coverage, proportionality, and timing. Purity measures the percentage of actual spam domains in a feed. Coverage measures how much spam a feed captures. Proportionality assesses the accuracy of the relative frequency of domains. Timing measures the accuracy of the period during which a domain appears in spam.

| Feed | DNS | HTTP | Tagged | ODP | Alexa |
|------|-----|------|--------|-----|-------|
| Hu   | 88% | 100% | 100%   | 96% | 6%    |
| dbl  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| uribl| 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| mx1  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| mx2  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| mx3  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| Ac1  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| Ac2  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| Bot  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |
| Hyb  | 97% | 95%  | 96%    | <1% | 64%   |

This analysis helps in evaluating the effectiveness and reliability of different spam domain sources.
