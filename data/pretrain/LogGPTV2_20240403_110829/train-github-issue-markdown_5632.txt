    I started using the time package (http://golang.org/pkg/time/) and it supports timezones
    only in the form of timezone offsets or the "deprecated" timezone
    abbreviations. 
    Since abbreviations are not guaranteed to be unique, it is generally understood that
    timezone names are the way to go (i.e. America/Los_Angeles instead of PST) but it's not
    possible with the current time package. 
    Can the support be added to the time package for zone names?
