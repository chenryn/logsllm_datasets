User: I have a python code, which has some part that needs to be run on foreground since it tells out if the socket connection was proper or not. Now after running that part the output is written into a file.
Is there a way to move the running python code (process) automatically from foreground to background after running some definite steps in foreground, so that I can continue my work on terminal.
I know using screen is a option but is there any other way to do so. Since after running a part on foreground, there won't be any output shown in the terminal, I don't want to run screen unnecessarily.
Assistant: If you have the #!/bin/env python, and its permissions are set correctly, you can try something like nohup /path/to/test.py &
