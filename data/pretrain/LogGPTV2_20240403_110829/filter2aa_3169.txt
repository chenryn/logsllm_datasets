A history of this talk
The O’Reilly 
Hacking Book:
Separating Bots from Humans
Pro-tips to get what you want:
● Include some market research
● Write it in Python, because it’s really popular
What are Web Scrapers, Bots, etc?
● They can use browsers
● They can take their sweet time
● They can be surprisingly smart
● They can be stunningly idiotic
Why They’re Important

On the Defense Side of Things
(For better or worse)
robots.txt?
● “No Trespassing, please?”
Terms of Service
● “Hey! You said you wouldn’t trespass!”
Headers
● “I’m totally not a bot. Promise”
JavaScript
● Make your site un-indexable for anyone but 
the bad guys
Embedding Text in Images
● Oh come on.
● You’re the type of person who writes email 
addresses like “m e (at sign) domain  . com”
○ And you have duct tape on your laptop’s web cam, 
mostly because you never use it.
CAPTCHAs
Annoying
Breakable
Honepots
● Can be effective, if implemented correctly
● Please don’t block the Google bots
Example time!

Behavioral Patterns
● Now we’re getting somewhere!
● Again, please don’t block the Google bots
IP Address Blocking
● It’s sort of effective… If they didn’t really care 
in the first place
● Lists are a pain to maintain
● You can easily block the good guys
On the Attack Side of Things...
Targeted vs. Non-Targeted Attacks
● Non-targeted: Also known as, “look for 
/phpMyAdmin”
● Targeted, usually to get proprietary data
OCR
● Works best on relatively normal text
● Can be used to solve CAPTCHAs
○ Time consuming to create training data. Have a 
series or two of a TV show ready
OCR Training Tool
● Everything you need to solve a CAPTCHA!

JavaScript Execution
● Selenium
● PhantomJS
Honeypot Avoidance
● Better than you might expect -- it’s biggest 
weakness is color

Stop Caring!
● Bot-proofing sites is way too much work, and 
often impedes accessibility
● Is your data really that valuable?
○ Consider API costs, ease of use -- make it more 
attractive to pay for data
● If your application is vulnerable to automated 
attacks, it’s vulnerable, period.
Question time!
