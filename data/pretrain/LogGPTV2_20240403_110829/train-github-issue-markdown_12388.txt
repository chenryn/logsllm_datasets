Hello, as stated in the summary, something needs to be done with the Scipy FFT
implementation.
Consider this example:
    import scipy as sp
    import scipy.fftpack
    import numpy as np
    import numpy.fft
    # Now watch the system's resource usage
    a = sp.rand(300,300,300)
    sp.fftpack.fftn(a)
    # Still lots of memory occupied
    np.fft.fftn(a)
    # Almost no additional memory occupied
The point is that scipy uses much more resources and frees little, numpy is
much better here.
