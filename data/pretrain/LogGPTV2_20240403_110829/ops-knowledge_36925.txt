Question: "A security audit has revealed that a web application creates new user accounts with a default password pattern 'Welcome1234', which increments numerically for each new user (e.g., 'Welcome1235' for the next user). What is the primary security concern with this practice?"
 "A": "The numerical incrementation makes the password more secure by adding complexity."
 "B": "Using 'Welcome' as the password prefix is a secure practice as it is friendly and welcoming to new users."
 "C": "Passwords that follow an easily discernible pattern can be predicted and are susceptible to brute-force attacks."
 "D": "Incrementing passwords numerically aids in user account management and auditing."
Answer: C
