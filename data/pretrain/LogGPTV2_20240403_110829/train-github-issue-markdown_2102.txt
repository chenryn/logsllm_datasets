##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
1.8 (devel) - works in 1.7
##### Environment:
running on: Linux Ubuntu  
managing: Linux Ubuntu
##### Summary:
`vars/main.yml` gets loaded from all roles at the beginning of playbook
(expected). In case one variable is in multiple roles, it **gets overwritten**
and receives the content from the last role in playbook, not the current role
(unexpected, regression).
In Ansible versions prior 1.8 (devel) any such variable got the current role's
`vars/main.yml` content. The current behavior breaks our infrastructure and
effectively eliminates our variable and task reuse.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
playbook-role-example.yml:
    - hosts: server
      roles:
        - role-1
        - role-2
roles/role-1/vars/main.yml:
    current_role: role-1
roles/role-1/tasks/main.yml:
    - name:         print current_role variable
      debug:        msg="Variable current_role is {{ current_role }}"
roles/role-2/vars/main.yml:
    current_role: role-2
roles/role-2/tasks/main.yml:
    - name:         print current_role variable
      debug:        msg="Variable current_role is {{ current_role }}"
##### Expected Results:
Output until (and including) 1.7.2:
    TASK: [role-1 | print current_role variable] ********************************** 
    ok: [192.168.56.101] => {
        "msg": "Variable current_role is role-1"
    }
    TASK: [role-2 | print current_role variable] ********************************** 
    ok: [192.168.56.101] => {
        "msg": "Variable current_role is role-2"
    }
##### Actual Results:
Output in 1.8 (devel):
    TASK: [role-1 | print current_role variable] ********************************** 
    ok: [192.168.56.101] => {
        "msg": "Variable current_role is role-2"
    }
    TASK: [role-2 | print current_role variable] ********************************** 
    ok: [192.168.56.101] => {
        "msg": "Variable current_role is role-2"
    }
