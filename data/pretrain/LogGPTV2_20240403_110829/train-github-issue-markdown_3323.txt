I have a freshly updated Angular project with the latest TypeScript 3.5.2 and
jasmine 3.3.13. During testing, I got an error with one of my mock objects.
    export class AuthServiceMock {
    	constructor() {
    		spyOn(this, 'logoff');
    	}
    	logoff() { }
    }
This test code used to work, but now using `spyOn()` gives an error:
> Argument of type '"logoff"' is not assignable to parameter of type
> 'this["logoff"] extends Function ? "logoff" : never'.ts(2345)
It's easily circumventable using `as`:
    spyOn(this as AuthServiceMock, 'logoff');
But this shouldn't be necessary, so I thought I'd share my findings.
