**Issue with `@types/xxxx` and TypeScript 3.5.2 in Angular Project**

I encountered an issue while using the `@types/xxxx` package in my recently updated Angular project, which includes the latest stable version of TypeScript (v3.5.2) and Jasmine (v3.3.13). I have a question that is not suitable for Stack Overflow, so I am reaching out here.

### Problem Description

During testing, I received an error when using `spyOn()` on one of my mock objects. The code used to work, but now it throws the following error:

```typescript
export class AuthServiceMock {
    constructor() {
        spyOn(this, 'logoff');  // Error occurs here
    }

    logoff() { }
}
```

**Error:**
```
Argument of type '"logoff"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'this["logoff"] extends Function ? "logoff" : never'.ts(2345)
```

### Temporary Workaround

The error can be bypassed by using a type assertion with `as`:

```typescript
spyOn(this as AuthServiceMock, 'logoff');
```

However, this workaround should not be necessary, and I believe there may be an underlying issue with the type definitions or TypeScript itself.

### Authors Mentioned

To address this issue, I would like to mention the authors of the type definitions (as seen in `index.d.ts`):

- @FDIM
- @kolodny

I hope it is appropriate to mention these authors. If there are other contributors who should be included, please let me know.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
