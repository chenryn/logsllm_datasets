#### Location-Based Social Media
Major social media platforms allow users to geotag their activities. This section discusses how to use geolocation features to gather intelligence about a specific target or subject.

##### YouTube
To search for geotagged videos on YouTube, use the Geo Search Tool (https://youtube.github.io/geo-search-tool/search.html). You can search for videos at a specific address within a given timeframe and filter results by upload time. Results are displayed on a map with red markers (see Figure 7-4).

##### Facebook
Facebook, the leading social networking site, allows users to geotag posts, photos, and videos. We have already covered how to search within Facebook. Here, we focus on searching for geotagged content:

- **Places Visited by Target Profile**: https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/places-visited/
- **Recent Places Checked In by Target Profile**: https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/places-checked-in/
- **Common Places Checked In by Two Targets**: https://www.facebook.com/search/Facebook_Profile_ID_1/places-checked-in/ Facebook_Profile_ID_2/places-checked-in/intersect/
- **Common Events Attended by Two Targets**: https://www.facebook.com/search/Facebook_Profile_ID_1/events/ Facebook_Profile_ID_2/events/intersect/
- **Posts Written in a Specific Location**: Use the Facebook search bar to enter "Posts written in Seattle, WA."

**Tip**: Finding intersections between two Facebook profiles can reveal relationships and open avenues for further investigation.

**Facebook Live**: Visit [https://www.facebook.com/live](https://www.facebook.com/live) to see live broadcasts on a global map. Click on a blue dot to view or save a live video.

##### Twitter
Twitter allows users to post tweets with current location data, which can help investigators determine a target's current or previous locations. To search for tweets based on geolocation:

1. **Extract GPS Coordinates**: Use Google Maps to find the target location's GPS coordinates.
2. **Search for Tweets**: In the Twitter search box, type `near:` followed by the latitude and longitude in quotation marks.
3. **Filter Results**: Add advanced Twitter search operators to refine the search (e.g., `within:3mil`, `filter:images`, `since:2018-03-18`).

**Tweet Mapper (https://keitharm.me/projects/tweet)**: A free service that lists all geotagged tweets. Enter the target's Twitter handle to see a map with red markers indicating tweet locations.

**One Million Tweet Map (https://onemilliontweetmap.com)**: View the last one million tweets on a map, with filters to refine results.

**Qtr Tweets (http://qtrtweets.com/twitter)**: Find tweets within a specific distance from a target location, with options to search for keywords and filter by criteria like images.

**Tweet Map (https://www.mapd.com/demos/tweetmap)**: Visualize all tweets on a global map. Click on points to read tweet content and see top hashtags.

**Periscope Map (www.periscopemap.live)**: Shows Twitter Periscope live videos on a world map.

##### Other Social Media Platforms
While many social media services allow geotagging, this chapter focuses on Facebook and Twitter. Another notable service is **Strava**, a social networking app for athletes to measure and share their activities. The Strava Heat Map (https://www.strava.com/heatmap) shows aggregated public activities over the last two years, updated monthly. It has been used to reveal military base locations due to soldiers' fitness tracking activities.

**Note**: Investigating a Strava heat map can reveal important information about users' sporting activities and routes.

**Flickr (https://www.flickr.com/map)**: View photos uploaded to Flickr on a map.

**Snapchat (https://map.snapchat.com)**: A live map showing snaps of events and breaking news from around the world.

#### Conducting Location Searches on Social Media Using Automated Tools
Several tools are useful for gathering geotagged and non-geotagged data online:

- **Creepy (https://www.geocreepy.com)**: A geolocation OSINT tool for gathering information from Twitter, Instagram, Google+, and Flickr.
- **Oryon OSINT Browser (https://sourceforge.net/projects/oryon-osint-browser)**: A browser with OSINT links and privacy-enhanced features.
- **Maltego (https://spreadsecurity.github.io/2016/09/03/open-source-intelligence-with-maltego.html)**: A data mining tool with a GUI for gathering and visualizing open source intelligence.
- **Spider Foot (www.spiderfoot.net)**: An automated OSINT tool that queries over 100 open data sources to find information about the target.

#### Country Profile Information
These websites provide overviews and statistics about different countries, covering geography, history, politics, economy, and more:

- **BBC Country Profiles (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/country_profiles/default.stm)**: A guide to the history, politics, and economic backgrounds of countries and territories, with archived BBC content.

#### Transport Tracking
With the advancement of communication technology, most vehicles and transportation systems are location-aware, equipped with GPS or other satellite tracking sensors. Many free services provide tracking information for land vehicles, ships, and airplanes, including historical records.

##### Air Movements
Services that track air flights (cargo, private, and commercial airplanes):

- **FlightAware (https://uk.flightaware.com)**: The largest flight-tracking data company, offering free tracking for both private and commercial air traffic. It aggregates data from air control systems and ground stations in multiple countries.
