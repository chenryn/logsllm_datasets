 Location-Based Social Media
Major social media platforms allow their users to geotag some of their activities when 
using them. In this section, we will discuss how you can use the geolocation feature 
offered by major social media platforms to collect intelligence about a specific target or 
subject.
 YouTube
To search for videos tagged with geocoordinates on YouTube, you can use a dedicated 
tool called Geo Search Tool (https://youtube.github.io/geo-search-tool/search.
html). You can search for videos at a given address and in a given timeframe. You can 
also specify a distance from the location entered; hence, the search can be as broad as 
1,000 KM or as narrow at 1 KM. The returned results can be filtered according to each 
video upload time. Final results appear graphically on a map as a red marker (see 
Figure 7-4).
Chapter 7  Online Maps

 Facebook
Facebook is the number-one social networking site. It allows its users to geotag posts, 
photos, and videos, in addition to posting status updates with their current geolocation. 
We already covered how to search within Facebook thoroughly. In this section, we will 
focus on searching for locations within Facebook user-generated content.
 Using Facebook Graph in the Location Search
We already covered how to find a specific user’s (or page/group’s) Facebook profile_id 
value. The following links will demonstrate how to use a Facebook Graph Search to fetch 
results based on geotagged content.

 Twitter
Twitter allows users to post tweets combined with current location data (see Figure 7- 5).  
Such tweets can help investigators to determine the current/previous locations of a 
target at a specific point in time. In this section, we will cover how to locate tweets based 
on their geolocation information.
 Search for Tweets in a Specific Geographical Location
The Twitter search functionality allows you to search for tweets posted within a specific 
location using GPS coordinates. To locate all tweets posted from a specific location on 
Earth, follow these steps:
 1. Open Google Maps, navigate to the target location, and click the 
exact point on the map to see its GPS coordinates (see Figure 7-6).

 2. Go to the Twitter search box and type near: followed by the 
target’s latitude and longitude enclosed in quotation marks  
(see Figure 7-7).
 3. You can add more advanced Twitter search operators to the 
previous search to further filter its results (see Figure 7-8).

As shown in Figure 7-8, note that three filters are applied on the previous location 
search.
• 
Within:3mil: This limits the results to three miles from the target GPS 
coordinates.
• 
Filter:images: This returns tweets that contain images within it.
• 
Since:2018-03-18: The tweet’s date must be from the date specified 
and later.
To see the exact time when any tweet was posted, hover your mouse over its 
timestamp (see Figure 7-9). Please note that the date/time that appears is according to 
the time zone of your Twitter account settings, not the uploader’s date/time.
 Tweet Mapper
Tweet Mapper (https://keitharm.me/projects/tweet) is a free service that lists all 
geotagged tweets (all tweets posted while the location feature is ON). All you need to do 
is to enter the target’s Twitter handle and then press Enter. A map will appear showing 
red markers (see Figure 7-10) over all the geographical locations where this target posts 
their geotagged tweets. Click any marker to see related tweets below the map.

 Other Social Media Platforms
There are hundreds of social media services, and many of them allow users to geotag 
published contents, but in this chapter we focused on the most popular two: Facebook 
and Twitter.
To enrich your thinking about the wide possibilities of OSINT gathering offered by 
geo-enabled social media services, we will briefly cover an additional service that uses 
users’ geolocation data to offer functions. This service is called Strava, and it is used 
mainly as a social networking app for athletes to measure and share their activities.
 Strava Heat Map
A Strava heat map (https://www.strava.com/heatmap) is a performance measurement 
sporting app for athletes; it works by monitoring athletic activities through the GPS 
sensor existing within their smartphone (supports Apple and Android) or any other 
supported device like GPS watches and head units and uploading such data to its 
servers to make it available for sharing. This is a free app, but it reserves some premium 
features for paying users (e.g., showing advanced statistics about user activities). The 
most popular usage of this app is tracking users’ activities while cycling and running.
A Strava heat map shows “heat” made by aggregated, public activities over the last 
two years; this map is updated monthly. At the beginning of 2018, Strava revealed several 
military base locations in Syria and Afghanistan because the military personals inside 
these—secret—bases were using this app to measure and track their fitness exercises. 
Base locations appeared clearly as the soldiers were moving around inside the base, 
drawing a clear border of each base.
What happened with Strava shows clearly that despite all security measures, the 
lack of user security training can lead to revealing military secrets that are available for 
intelligence gathering.

Note! investigating a strava heat map can reveal important information about 
users’ sporting activities and the run routes they use.

 Conducting Location Searches on Social Media Using 
Automated Tools
There are many tools that can prove useful when searching for data (both geotagged 
and nongeotagged) online. In this section, we will briefly mention some popular OSINT 
gathering tools for gathering different kinds of public information, including geolocation 
content, from both Internet and social media platforms.

These websites offer brief overviews and statistics about different countries throughout 
the world. Such overviews include information about a country’s geography, history, 
politics, economy, international relations, culture, travel, military, health, education, and 
other topics.
The following are the most popular suppliers of country profile information:
• 
The World Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/
the-world-factbook/index.html): This is a reference resource 
published by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); it provides 
information on the history, population, government, economy,

the BBC service.
 Transport Tracking
With the advancement of communication technology, most vehicles and public/
private transportation are location aware, meaning they come with a GPS or other 
satellite tracking system sensor to identify its current location. Tracking systems offer a 
comprehensive picture of the subject vehicle location in addition to other information 
about it such as vehicle name (if applicable), type, cargo, destination, owner, and many 
other technical details. Many free services online facilitate access to tracking information 
about land vehicles, ships, and airplanes; such information can prove extremely useful 
during any type of online investigation, especially when knowing that many sites also list 
previous tracking records of vehicles, ships, and vessels in its public databases.
