User: I want get the mount node of an usb mass-storage device, like /media/its-uuid
in pyudev, class Device has some general attributes, but not uuid or mount node.
how to do it
thanks help
Assistant: With pyudev, each device object provides a dictionary-like interface for its attributes. You can list them all with device.keys(), e.g. UUID is for block devices is dev['ID_FS_UUID'].
