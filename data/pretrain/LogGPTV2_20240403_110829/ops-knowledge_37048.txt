I would like to obtain the mount point (e.g., `/media/its-uuid`) of a USB mass storage device using `pyudev`. The `Device` class in `pyudev` provides several general attributes, but it does not directly include the UUID or the mount point.

How can I achieve this?

Thank you for your help.

**Solution:**

In `pyudev`, each device object provides a dictionary-like interface for its attributes. You can list all available attributes using `device.keys()`. For block devices, the UUID is typically available under the key `ID_FS_UUID`.

To get the mount point, you can use the `ID_FS_UUID` attribute in combination with the `os` module to find the corresponding mount point. Hereâ€™s an example of how you can do this:

```python
import pyudev
import os

# Create a context and a monitor
context = pyudev.Context()
monitor = pyudev.Monitor.from_netlink(context)
monitor.filter_by(subsystem='block')

# Iterate over the devices
for device in iter(monitor.poll, None):
    if device.action == 'add' and 'ID_FS_UUID' in device:
        uuid = device['ID_FS_UUID']
        # Find the mount point using the UUID
        mount_point = f'/media/{uuid}'
        if os.path.ismount(mount_point):
            print(f"Mount point: {mount_point}")
```

This script will monitor for new block devices and print the mount point if it matches the format `/media/its-uuid`.

Thank you for your assistance!
