When you execute a `.py` file and want to direct its output to both the console and a text file, the `execfile` command alone won't suffice. The `execfile` function is also deprecated in Python 3, so it's better to use the `python` command directly. 

To redirect the output of your script to a text file while still displaying it on the shell, you can use the `tee` command in Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) or PowerShell in Windows.

### For Unix-based Systems (Linux, macOS):

1. **Using `tee` Command:**
   ```sh
   python file.py | tee output.txt
   ```
   - This command runs `file.py` and pipes the output to `tee`, which then writes it to `output.txt` and also displays it on the terminal.

2. **Using `>` Operator:**
   If you only want to write the output to the file and not display it on the terminal, you can use:
   ```sh
   python file.py > output.txt
   ```

### For Windows (PowerShell):

1. **Using `Tee-Object` Command:**
   ```powershell
   python file.py | Tee-Object -FilePath output.txt
   ```
   - This command runs `file.py` and uses `Tee-Object` to write the output to `output.txt` and also display it in the PowerShell window.

2. **Using `>` Operator:**
   If you only want to write the output to the file and not display it on the terminal, you can use:
   ```powershell
   python file.py > output.txt
   ```

### Example:

If your script `file.py` prints "Hello, World!":

```python
# file.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Running the following command in a Unix-based system:
```sh
python file.py | tee output.txt
```

Or in PowerShell:
```powershell
python file.py | Tee-Object -FilePath output.txt
```

This will display "Hello, World!" in the terminal and also write it to `output.txt`.

### Troubleshooting:

- Ensure that `file.py` has the correct permissions to be executed.
- Make sure that the `output.txt` file is writable. You might need to create it if it doesn't exist, or ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the directory.
- Check for any syntax errors or issues in your script that might prevent it from running correctly.
