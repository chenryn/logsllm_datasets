Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple attempts to contact the RM and renew a lease for DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1. Each attempt is accompanied by an address change detection for both the RM and the lease renewer. The RM is contacted multiple times, but each attempt results in an error. The lease renewer is also unable to renew the lease for the specified time.
