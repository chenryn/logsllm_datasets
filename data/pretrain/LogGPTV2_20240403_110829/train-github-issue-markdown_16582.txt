Hi, I created the following component that accepts a raw svg string and
transforms it into a react element. The component works; however, on the
server, the SVG is being escaped.
    import React, {PropTypes, Component} from 'react';
    export default class Svg extends Component {
      static propTypes = {
        svg: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      }
      render() {
        const {...other, svg} = this.props;
        return (
        );
      }
    }
In the browser console I get this error:
"React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was invalid.
This generally means that you are using server rendering and the markup
generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React injected
new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the benefits of
server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being generated is
different on the client or server"
