Very much like OneHotEncoder, but will have a parameter for setting threshold.
If a feature value occurs more than the specified threshold, then it will get
encoded like OneHotEncoder. Otherwise, feature values occurring fewer than the
threshold, they will get encoded into the last bit of the encoded array.
