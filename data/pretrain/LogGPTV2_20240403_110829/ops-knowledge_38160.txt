I have a Python-based web service hosted on OpenShift, but it stopped working a few days ago. The logs indicate an error: "script timed out before returning headers," and I have been unable to resolve this issue.

Could someone please assist me with this problem?

**Response:**

To troubleshoot the issue, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to your OpenShift account.
2. Verify that your application and all associated cartridges are up and running.
3. Check the configuration settings for any timeouts or resource limitations that might be causing the script to time out.
4. Review the application code to ensure that it is not encountering any long-running processes or deadlocks that could cause the timeout.

If you need further assistance, please provide more details about your application's setup and any recent changes that may have been made.
