i'm getting an error saying "Cannot open file named *.py"
but i'm able to open all the python files in vim using this command

Assistant: You cannot using standard Windows cmd shell. You can use something like bash from Cygwin, maybe PowerShell.
If you want to open *.py from application like vim but in Python, then you can use glob module.
