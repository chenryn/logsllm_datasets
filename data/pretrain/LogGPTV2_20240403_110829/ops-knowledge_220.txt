Question: In the context of an off-by-one vulnerability that allows an attacker to overflow a buffer by one byte, which steps are critical for the attacker to manipulate the control flow of a program to execute arbitrary code?
"A": "Changing the least significant byte of the saved frame pointer (sfp) to point inside the buffer during the overflow.",
"B": "Placing the address of the shellcode four bytes above where the forged saved frame pointer (sfp) points.",
"C": "Overwriting the most significant byte of the saved instruction pointer (rip) to alter the return address.",
"D": "Inserting the shellcode at the top of the stack before the saved instruction pointer (rip)."
Answer: AB
