            Minimize the number of Public IPs (i.e. NICs with PublicIP) on a virtual networkPublic IPs
                provide direct access over the internet exposing the VM to all type of attacks over the public network.

            Use of IP Forwarding on any NIC in a virtual network should be scrutinizedEnabling IP
                Forwarding on a VM NIC allows the VM to receive traffic addressed to other destinations. IP forwarding
                is required only in rare scenarios (e.g., using the VM as a network virtual appliance) and those should
                be reviewed with the network security team.

            NSG should be used for subnets in a virtual network to permit traffic only on required
                    inbound/outbound ports. NSGs should not have a rule to allow any-to-any trafficRestricting
                inbound and outbound traffic via NSGs limits the network exposure of the subnets within a virtual
                network and limits the attack surface.

            All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control
                    (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted
                just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of
                user/service account compromise.

            Presence of any virtual network gateways (GatewayType = VPN/ExpressRoute) in the virtual network
                    must be justifiedVirtual network gateways enable network traffic between a virtual
                network and other networks. All such connectivity must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that
                corporate data is not subject to exposure on untrusted networks.

            Use of any virtual network peerings should be justifiedResources in the peered virtual
                networks can communicate with each other directly. If the two peered networks are on different sides of
                a security boundary (e.g., corpnet v. private vNet), this can lead to exposure of corporate data. Hence
                any vNet peerings should be closely scrutinized and approved by the network security team
