### Virtual Network Security Controls

| Control | Description & Rationale | Severity | Automated | Fix Script Available |
|---------|-------------------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Minimize Public IPs | Limit the number of public IPs (i.e., NICs with public IPs) on a virtual network. Public IPs provide direct internet access, exposing VMs to various types of attacks over the public network. | High | Yes | No |
| IP Forwarding Scrutiny | Review the use of IP forwarding on any NIC in a virtual network. Enabling IP forwarding on a VM NIC allows it to receive traffic intended for other destinations. IP forwarding is necessary only in rare scenarios (e.g., using the VM as a network virtual appliance) and should be reviewed with the network security team. | High | Yes | No |
| NSG Usage | Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) for subnets in a virtual network to permit traffic only on required inbound/outbound ports. NSGs should not have a rule to allow any-to-any traffic. Restricting inbound and outbound traffic via NSGs limits the network exposure of subnets and reduces the attack surface. | Medium | Yes | No |
| RBAC Permissions | Grant all users/identities minimum required permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Leveraging RBAC ensures that users have just enough permissions to perform their tasks, minimizing resource exposure in case of user or service account compromise. | Medium | Yes | No |
| Justify Virtual Network Gateways | Ensure that the presence of any virtual network gateways (GatewayType = VPN/ExpressRoute) in the virtual network is justified. Virtual network gateways enable network traffic between a virtual network and other networks. All such connectivity must be carefully scrutinized to prevent the exposure of corporate data on untrusted networks. | High | Yes | No |
| Justify Virtual Network Peerings | Justify the use of any virtual network peerings. Resources in peered virtual networks can communicate directly. If the two peered networks are on different sides of a security boundary (e.g., corpnet vs. private vNet), this can lead to the exposure of corporate data. Any vNet peerings should be closely scrutinized and approved by the network security team. | High | Yes | No |

This table outlines key security controls for virtual networks, providing a clear description, rationale, severity, and automation status for each control.
