I have a PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer that is prefixed with #{  
I can use it for any spring definition except those that are using namespaces.  
For example:  
Code:
It wont process the value and I get exceptions that the value must be an
integer.  
How can I use PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer with namespaces?
