### Achieving an Accuracy of 94%

DAI (Device-Aware Inference) attacks are executed based on the inferred home configuration.

### B. Validation of Attacks

This section outlines the methodology and results for validating DAI attacks in the two testbed environments, T1 and T2.

#### 1. Methodology

To facilitate the validation process, we requested the testbed members to assist by triggering automation rules through controlled behavior patterns. The instructions provided included specific daily activities such as entering or leaving the home through the garage door, entering a particular room, and so forth. For example, when testing Rules 14 and 15 in T1 and Rules 8 and 9 in T2, which are triggered by smoke or water leaks, we asked the testbed members to safely trigger the smoke and water sensors. Due to physical constraints, we used smart switches instead of real water valves and sprinklers for these rules.

While the testbed members were triggering the victim rules, our attack script was running to delay the actual device events or commands (see Table IV). To establish a ground truth for validation, we repeated the process over two days. On the first day, we set the delay period to 0 for all events and commands, effectively conducting no attacks. On the second day, we performed DAI attacks by setting specific time periods to delay the target event or command of the victim rules. We collected event and command logs for analysis, using the automation result from the first day as the ground truth for comparison.

We compared the automation results of each pair of victim rules on the second day (with attack) with those from the first day (without attack). If the results were the same, it indicated that the rules were not attacked on the second day. Otherwise, we manually verified whether the automation result on the second day was consistent with the expected attack result. If so, the attack was validated.

### Device Logs and Automation Evaluation

Device logs are essential for evaluating the correctness of automation. Among the nine platforms deployed in the testbeds, three (SmartThings, HomeKit, and Alexa) are non-endpoint platforms with access to a broader range of device types. However, Alexa does not provide a convenient logging tool. Therefore, we used the built-in logging functions in the SmartThings mobile app and a third-party mobile app, Home+ 4, to collect HomeKit data.

Since the Alexa devices in the testbeds can be accessed via SmartThings and/or HomeKit, all device events could be collected using at least one of these methods. Note that we did not collect logs for hub devices as they are not used in automation rules. For analysis convenience, we converted the raw event logs from the SmartThings and Home+ 4 apps (denoted as EST and EHK) into a uniform format. Each element (event) in the reformatted logs is a tuple: ⟨TestbedID, DeviceID, Attribute, Value, Timestamp⟩, where TestbedID, DeviceID, Attribute, and Value uniquely identify an event type. For example, a motion active event sent by device 7 in testbed T1 can be denoted as ⟨1, 7, motion, active⟩. An event type may have multiple instances at different timestamps, and the new event log is sorted by timestamp.

The timestamps of events represent the time instances when the platforms receive the events, which may be delayed by an attack. This is why we use the events from the first day, in the absence of attacks, as the ground truth. Based on the event logs EST and EHK from both days, we can track the execution of rules as in existing work [26], [51].
