We  compare  the  delay  incurred  in  transmitting 
packets  under  SPIN  and  SPMS.  The  delay  is  measured 
from the time the ADV packet is sent out by the source 
to  the  time  that  the  data  packet  is  received  at  the 
destination. The delay is obviously different for different 
source  destination  pairs  and  for  the  results,  the  average 
delay across all the packets is plotted.

than  SPIN.  The  delay  difference  between  SPIN  and 
SPMS widens with increasing number of nodes. This is 
because  the  delay  to  a  node  increases  faster  in  SPIN 
since  each  round  of  SPIN  where  the  data  is  transmitted 
to  all  the  nodes  in  a  zone  takes  longer  than  a 
corresponding  round  of  SPMS.  With  increasing  sensor 
field size, more number of rounds has to be executed to 
reach a given destination.  
The  effect  of  the  transmission  radius  on  the  delay  is 
shown  in  Figure  9.  As  the  radius  increases,  the  delay 
drops for both SPIN and SPMS. At first, one may think 
that  since  the  number  of  nodes  is  increasing,  the  delay 
would  increase. As  the  radius  increases,  the  number  of 
nodes  in  the  zone,  which  hear  the  ADV  packet, 
increases.  This  increases  the  number  of  nodes  that 
acquire  the  data  packet  in  response  in  the  same  round. 
As opposed to this, for a smaller transmission radius, the 
data  has  to  ripple  through  multiple  zones  in  multiple 
rounds  before  reaching  the  destination. The  decrease  in 
delay  with  increasing  radius  offsets  the  increase  due  to 
increased contention at the MAC layer as the number of 
nodes in a zone increases.  
5.1.2
Static Failure Case  
We  test  SPMS  and  SPIN  under  failure  scenarios, 
called  F-SPMS  and  F-SPIN  respectively.  The  type  of 
failures considered is transient node failures. Nodes fail 
with an exponential inter-arrival time (mean (cid:79)) and stay 
failed  for  a  time  drawn  from  a  uniform  distribution 
(repairmin,  repairmax).  During  the  time  of  repair,  any 
received  message  is  dropped  and  any  scheduled  packet 
transfer  is  cancelled.    We  assume  recovery  is  always 
successful.  In  our  implementation,  the  routing  table 
keeps  only  the  shortest  (i.e.,  least  cost)  and  the  second 
shortest path to the destination which tolerates only one 
failure during the recovery window. 
In order to compare the results against the failure-free 
runs, the number of new packets generated by each node 
is  kept  at  the  same.  As  expected,  the  delay  increases 
(Figure 8 plots 1 & 3) in the failure cases because now 
some  nodes  in  the  zone  have  to  wait  for  the  timer (cid:87)ADV
or (cid:87)DAT  to go off and then request the packet through the 
alternate path.  The delay difference between the failure 
and  the  failure  free  runs  for  the  small  radii  is  small  as 
there are less intermediate hops. As the radius increases 
there are relay nodes whose failure induces the delay in 
SPMS  in  getting  the  packet.  The  scalability  test  shows 
that for a small number of nodes, the length of the path 
is  smaller  and  therefore  the  number  of  failures  being 
activated  is  smaller.  Therefore,  the  difference  between 
the failure free and failure cases is not substantial, but it 
becomes pronounced as the number of nodes increases.  
5.1.3 Mobile Failure Free Cases  
In this set of experiments, nodes are allowed to move. 
As  nodes  move,  the  routing  tables  have  to  be  modified 
and  no  packet  transfer  can  take  place  until  the  routing 
tables converge. At some discrete times in the simulator 
clock,  a  predefined  fraction  of  nodes  move.  The  nodes 
which  are  to  move  and  their  destination  are  chosen 
randomly.  Once  the  routing  tables  converge,  the  data 
transmission  starts  all  over  again.  The  energy  expended 
in  SPMS  in  forming  routing  tables  is  included  in  the 
energy  measurement.  We  see  that  even  with  mobility 
SPMS  performs  better 
the 
percentage of energy savings go down (varies from 5%-
21%).    As  the  frequency  of  node  motion  increases, 
energy is required for setting up the routing tables. Our 
calculations  with  the  cost  of  running  Bellman  Ford  and 
the energy gain of SPMS over SPIN lead us to conclude 
that  at  least  239.18  packets  must  be  successfully 
transmitted  between  two  instances  of  network  mobility 
for SPMS to save energy compared to SPIN.

5.2. Cluster-Based Communication

The  cluster  heads  are  responsible  for  collecting  the 
data  and  so  request  the  data  if  they  need  it.    The  other 
nodes  in  the  zone  of  the  source  node  can  also  be 
interested  in  data  with  a  probability  of  5%.  The  energy 
consumption is measured by varying the zone radius. In 
SPMS  the  communication  between  the  nodes  and  the

transmission in SPIN. In Figure 10 (plots 1 & 3) and we 
see that SPMS consumes 35-59% less energy than SPIN 
for  the  failure-free  case.  As  the  transmission  radius 
increases  a  cluster  has  a  larger  radius  with  more  scope 
for  the  multi-hop  communication  of  SPMS  and  hence, 
the  energy  difference  increases. Next,  node  failures  are 
injected 
for  all-to-all 
communication.  As  one  can  see  from  the  Figure  10,  in 
failure  cases  (plots  2  &  4),  the  energy  expended  by  the 
protocols is much more than for the failure-free runs.

6. Conclusion
In  the  paper,  we  have  presented  a  protocol  called 
SPMS  for  data  dissemination  in  energy  constrained 
wireless  sensor  networks.  The  protocol  uses  meta-data 
exchange  prior  to  exchange  of  data  to  decide  if  a  node 
requires the data. It uses a hybrid of push-pull – pushing 
the  advertisement  of  the  data  from  the  source  followed 
by  a  pull  from  the  interested  destination.  Unlike  an 
earlier published protocol SPIN that also uses meta-data 
exchange,  SPMS  uses  shortest  distance  multi-hop 
routing  for  the  request  and  data  transfers.  This  allows 
substantial  energy  savings.  Also,  somewhat  counter-
intuitively,  SPMS  reduces  the  end-to-end  data  latency. 
The  low  power  transmission  reduces  contention  for  the 
shared wireless MAC channel and thus reduces the delay 
due to MAC layer backoff.

We  present  a  theoretical  analysis  of  the  energy 
expended  and  delay  in  SPMS  and  compare  it  to  that  in 
SPIN. As the transmission radius increases, the delay in 
SPIN  approaches

orders of magnitude higher. The simulation study of the

includes 
For future work, we propose to consider an extension 
to  SPMS  to  disseminate  data  when  the  source  and  the 
destination  are  in  separate  zones  with  no  interested 
nodes in the intermediate zones. This would require the 
use  of  zone  routing  of  [4]  and  the  request  phase  of  the 
protocol  to  go  across  zones.  We  are  also  investigating 
the  issue  of  data  caching  at  intermediate  nodes  which 
route the data but are not receivers. This can improve the 
fault tolerant property of the protocol.
