### Programming and Machine Learning Techniques

Programming, particularly through inductive logic programming, provides a framework for incorporating background knowledge. This knowledge is represented as logic predicates and first-order rules. In contrast, attribute-value learners rely exclusively on training examples, which are limited to a fixed number of attributes.

#### Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)

- **Background Knowledge**: ILP can easily handle the background knowledge introduced in Section 2.1, including alert context and arbitrary Prolog clauses.
- **Search Space**: The search space in ILP is much larger compared to other machine learning techniques like rule and decision tree learners. This results in smaller problem sizes that can be solved efficiently, making ILP less efficient and potentially unsuitable for real-time learning.

#### Attribute-Value Learners

- **Feature Construction**: These learners can use a limited form of background knowledge through feature construction, also known as propositionalization. This involves creating additional attributes based on existing attributes or background knowledge.
- **Suitability**: Given that most background knowledge for intrusion detection can be converted into additional features using feature construction, and considering runtime requirements, symbolic attribute-value learners are a good choice for alert classification.

### Confidence of Classification

- **Techniques**: Symbolic attribute-value learners include decision tree learners (e.g., C4.5) and rule learners (e.g., AQ, C4.5rules, RIPPER).
- **Comprehensibility**: Rules generated by rule learners are more comprehensible to humans than decision trees.
- **Selection**: After analyzing available rule learners and their applications in intrusion detection, we chose RIPPER due to its efficiency, effectiveness, and ability to produce concise and intuitive rules.

### RIPPER Rule Learner

- **Rule Construction**: RIPPER builds a set of rules discriminating between classes. Each rule consists of conjunctions of attribute value comparisons followed by a class label.
- **Rule Sets**: RIPPER can produce ordered and unordered rule sets. For a two-class problem, an unordered rule set contains rules for both classes, while an ordered rule set contains rules for one class, with a default rule for the other class.
- **Advantages**: Ordered rule sets are more compact and easier to interpret.

### Cost-Sensitive Classification and Skewed Class Distribution

- **Methods**: We focused on methods that are not specific to a particular machine learning technique, such as Weighting and MetaCost.
- **Weighting**: This method resamples the training set to optimize misclassification cost. It uses a cost matrix to define the costs of misclassifications for individual class pairs.
- **Incremental Learning**: We used a "batch-incremental" approach, where new training examples are added to the training set, and the classifier is rebuilt when the classification accuracy drops below a user-defined threshold.

### Summary

- **Requirements**: No publicly available machine learning technique addresses all our requirements, particularly cost-sensitivity and incremental learning.
- **Choice**: Rule learners, specifically RIPPER, were chosen for their desirable properties and successful applications in similar domains.
- **Circumventing Limitations**: We implemented cost-sensitivity using Weighting and incremental learning using a "batch-incremental" approach.

### Experimental Validation

- **Prototype Implementation**: We built a prototype using the Weka framework, validated with synthetic and real intrusion detection data.
- **Binary Classification**: The prototype focuses on binary classification (true and false alerts), simplifying performance analysis.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix was used to evaluate the system's performance, with measures such as true positive rate, false positive rate, and weighted accuracy.

### Data Sources

- **Snort**: An open-source network-based IDS used to detect attacks and generate alerts.
- **Data Sets**:
  - **DARPA 1999**: A synthetic data set from a simulated medium-sized computer network.
  - **Data Set B**: A real-world data set from a medium-sized corporate network.

### Alert Labeling

- **DARPA 1999**: Alerts were automatically labeled using attack truth tables.
- **Data Set B**: Alerts were classified based on the author's expertise, with some unidentifiable alerts labeled as true positives.

### Background Knowledge

- **Types**: We focused on network topology and alert context.
- **Attributes**: Additional attributes were created to represent background knowledge, such as IP address classification and host type.
