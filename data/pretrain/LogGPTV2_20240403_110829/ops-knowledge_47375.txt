User: When using Git for code management, how to synchronize the local code base to the server?
Assistant: To synchronize the local code base to the server, you need to perform the following steps: 1. Create a blank Git repository on the server. 2. Associate the local code repository with the Git repository on the server. You can use the following command: ``` git remote add URL of the Git repository on the origin server ``` Or you can automatically establish an association when cloning the Git repository on the server: ``` git clone URL of the Git repository on the server ``` 3 . Submit the local code to the local Git repository. You can use the following command: ``` git add . git commit -m "commit information" ``` 4. Push the local code to the Git repository on the server. The following command can be used: ``` git push -u origin master ``` where "origin" is the name of the Git repository on the server and "master" is the name of the branch to push. After performing the above steps, the local code base can be synchronized to the Git repository on the server.
