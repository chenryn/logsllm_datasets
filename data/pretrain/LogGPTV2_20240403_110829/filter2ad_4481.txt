## Abstract
Although current mesh networks are predominantly WiFi-based, future networks are expected to be highly heterogeneous. The CARMEN (CARrier grade MEsh Networks) project aims to develop a heterogeneous mesh backhaul to provide carrier-grade (voice, video, and data) services. This demonstration presents the resource management and abstraction mechanisms in the CARMEN architecture, which address the challenges of managing heterogeneous radio access technologies.

## 1. Introduction
Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have significant potential for improving wireless coverage, as evidenced by the numerous community mesh networks worldwide. While current deployments are largely based on WiFi, future networks are anticipated to be highly heterogeneous. This trend is driven by the diverse range of available radio access technologies, each offering different performance and cost characteristics, thus catering to various needs. The primary goal of the CARMEN project [1] is to develop a heterogeneous mesh backhaul network capable of providing carrier-grade communication.

The main challenge in heterogeneous networks is the integration complexity of different radio technologies. To address this, CARMEN introduces an abstraction layer between the subnet and network layers. This layer translates technology-specific issues into a common set of events and commands that can be used by upper layers, such as self-configuration, routing, and mobility functions. Additionally, CARMEN abstracts heterogeneous resources by converting physical links of an access technology into abstract links. Specifically, the self-configuration function discovers and groups links with the same capacity, i.e., those that may interfere with each other, within the same link group. The available capacity of the link group is abstracted based on the cost of the specific radio access technology, which is then used by routing and resource reservation. The objective of this demonstration is to showcase the operation of link groups in the CARMEN architecture, supporting the abstraction and management of heterogeneous resources.

## 2. CARMEN Resource Management
To provide carrier-grade services over different technologies, a common set of primitives and a technology-agnostic way of managing resources are essential. CARMEN defines the architecture in Figure 1, with two key components:
1. **Interface Management Function (IMF):** An extension of IEEE 802.21, IMF defines a new set of common primitives to be used by upper layers, such as self-configuration.
2. **Technology-specific MAC Adapters:** These adapters provide resource abstraction and management. They interface with the packet queuing system for traffic handling and include link group management and monitoring management (MoMa).

### Link Group Management and Traffic Handling
Resource management within a link group is administered by the Link Group Manager (LGM), which computes abstract link costs representing the resources consumed by a transmission over a link, such as the current modulation [2]. Given the link cost for a flow \( c_i \) and the total capacity \( C \) of the link group, the bandwidth assignment to each flow \( i \) should respect the inequality \( \sum_i c_i r_i \leq C \). The LGM provides this information to the routing function, which computes optimal routes using linear programming.

Resource reservations are also managed by the LGM, which configures the MAC parameters to meet the desired bandwidth and delay requirements. For example, in IEEE 802.11e-based CSMA, the LGM tunes the EDCA parameters of each output queue and broadcasts the new configuration to all nodes in its link group.

### Link Group Configuration
In our example, the network is configured with two link groups: one with a TDMA-based MAC (over WiFi) and one with an IEEE 802.11e-based CSMA MAC. All nodes use single radios to reduce intra-node interference. In Figure 2, CMP1 and CMP3 are wired and act as a single node with dual radios supporting multiple technologies. These two link groups are shown using the output from the monitoring node.

The TDMA-based MAC is a custom token-based protocol where the LGM computes a schedule based on traffic requirements and passes tokens granting the right to send to each node in its link group. The CSMA-based MAC builds on the standard EDCA using the ad-hoc mode. Although any node can potentially act as the LGM, a voting mechanism is used to elect one. This node then broadcasts the EDCA parameters.

### Traffic Handling within Heterogeneous Link Groups
Traffic handling will be demonstrated through different resource allocations in the two link groups. The costs associated with using different links will be displayed using flow tables, which show the total bandwidth in each link group, the available bandwidth for each flow, the actual bandwidth used by each flow, and the cost of the link.

To demonstrate the effect of resource allocation, we will first stream video to the client, which is associated with the CAP 2 hops away from the video server (see Figure 2), without resource allocation. In this case, the video will be treated as Best-Effort traffic. Even though there is no contention in the network, viewing problems might occur due to streaming through 2 hops and wireless interference. This will serve as our baseline operation. Next, we will start background flows in both link groups, showing that video performance severely degrades.

Next, we will perform resource allocation by the LGMs, adjusting the MAC parameters at each link group. Flow tables will show the current resource allocations, where the allocation parameters are set differently for each technology. Thus, although the underlying technologies are different, their specifics are hidden from the upper layers. We will then start the video and background traffic again, confirming that the video is not as severely affected.

## 3. Demo Scenario
To demonstrate how CARMEN abstracts the underlying heterogeneity in the network, we use the scenario depicted in Figure 2. One CARMEN Access Point (CAP) acts as a standard IEEE 802.11 client, several mesh nodes and laptops act as CARMEN Mesh Points (CMP), and one additional laptop performs monitoring and visualization of events.

## 4. Conclusion
Heterogeneous wireless mesh networks will become an integral part of carrier-grade wireless networking. Resource management and abstraction play a crucial role in utilizing different radio access technologies within the same infrastructure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that shows how to expose the costs and capabilities of different radio access technologies to the upper layers, specifically self-configuration and routing.

**Measurement and Monitoring**
For managing wireless resources (e.g., computing current link costs), a number of statistics are recorded at each node, such as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and channel utilization. Based on these measurements, the MoMa function generates link reports, which may trigger changes by self-configuration and routing. The basic algorithm used by MoMa is as follows:
1. After \( T_1 \) seconds of silence from a neighbor, the link is marked as "Going Down."
2. If nothing is heard for an additional \( T_2 \) seconds, the link is marked as "Down."
