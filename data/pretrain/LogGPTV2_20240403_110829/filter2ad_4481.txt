ABSTRACT
Even though current mesh networks are mostly WiFi-based,
future networks are expected to be highly heterogeneous.
Motivated by this expectation, CARMEN (CARrier grade
MEsh Networks) project focuses on developing a heteroge-
neous mesh backhaul to provide carrier-grade (voice, video
and data) services. This demo presents resource manage-
ment and abstraction in CARMEN architecture, which al-
low meeting the challenges of heterogeneous radio access.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have high potential for
improving wireless coverage as seen by the number of com-
munity mesh networks worldwide. Although current deploy-
ments are mostly WiFi-based, future networks are expected
to be highly heterogeneous. Such a future is unavoidable
due to the high diversity in available radio access technolo-
gies, which oﬀer diﬀerent performance and cost trends and
hence, tailor to diﬀerent needs. The main goal of the CAR-
MEN project [1] is to develop a heterogeneous mesh back-
haul network for carrier-grade communication.
The main challenge in heterogeneous networks is the in-
tegration complexity of diﬀerent radio technologies. To ad-
dress this, CARMEN introduces an abstraction layer be-
tween the subnet and the network layers to translate tech-
nology speciﬁc issues into a common set of events and com-
mands to be used by upper layers (e.g., self-conﬁguration,

routing and mobility functions).
In addition, CARMEN
provides abstraction of heterogeneous resources by turning
physical links of an access technology to abstract links. Specif-
ically, the self-conﬁguration function discovers and groups
links that share the same capacity, i.e., that may interfere
with each other, within the same link group. The available
capacity of the link group is abstracted based on the cost
of the speciﬁc radio access technology, which is in turn used
by routing and resource reservation. The objective of this
demo is to show the operation of link groups in the CAR-
MEN architecture, supporting abstraction and management
of heterogeneous resources.
2. CARMEN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
To provide carrier-grade services over diﬀerent technolo-
gies, a common set of primitives, and a technology-agnostic
way of managing resources are needed. To this end, CAR-
MEN deﬁnes the architecture in Fig. 1, with two key com-
ponents: (1) The Interface Management Function (IMF), an
extension of IEEE 802.21, that deﬁnes a new set of common
primitives to be used by upper layers, e.g., self-conﬁguration.
(2) The technology-speciﬁc MAC adapters that provide re-
source abstraction and management. They interface with
the packet queuing system for traﬃc handling and com-
prise of link group management and monitoring manage-
ment (MoMa).
Link Group Management and Trafﬁc Handling
Resource management within a link group is administered
by the Link Group Manager (LGM), which computes ab-
stract link costs that represent the resources consumed by
a transmission over a link due to e.g., the current modu-
lation [2]. Given the link cost for a ﬂow i, ci, and the
total capacity C of the link group, the bandwidth assign-
ment to each ﬂow i should respect the following inequality:
Pi
ciri ≤ C. LGM provides this information to the rout-
ing function, which computes optimal routes based on linear
programming.
Resource reservations are also handled by the LGM, which
conﬁgures the MAC parameters to meet the desired band-
width and delay requirements. For instance, in IEEE 802.11e-
based CSMA, LGM tunes the EDCA parameters of each
output queue and broadcasts the new conﬁguration to all
nodes in its link group.
481Link Group Conﬁguration
In our example, the network is already conﬁgured to have
2 link groups, one with a TDMA-based MAC (over WiFi)
and one with IEEE 802.11e-based CSMA MAC. All nodes
use single radios to reduce the impact of intra-node inter-
ference. In Fig. 2, CMP1 and CMP3 are wired and act as a
single node with dual radios supporting multiple technolo-
gies. These two link groups are shown using the output from
the monitoring node.
The TDMA-based MAC is a custom token-based proto-
col, where the LGM computes a schedule based on traﬃc
requirements and passes tokens granting the right to send to
each node in its link group. The CSMA-based MAC builds
on top of the standard EDCA using the ad-hoc mode. Al-
though all nodes can potentially act as the LGM, a voting
mechanism is used to elect one. This node then broadcasts
EDCA parameters.
Trafﬁc Handling within Heterogeneous Link Groups
Traﬃc handling will be shown via diﬀerent resource alloca-
tions in the two link groups. The costs associated with using
diﬀerent links will be displayed using ﬂow tables, which show
the total bandwidth in each link group, the available band-
width for and the actual bandwidth used by each ﬂow, and
the cost of the link.
To show the eﬀect of resource allocation, we will ﬁrst
stream video to the client, which is associated to the CAP
2 hops away from the video server (see Fig. 2), without re-
source allocation. In this case the video will be treated like
Best-Eﬀort traﬃc. Even though there is no contention in
the network, viewing problems might occur due to stream-
ing through 2 hops and wireless interference. This will be our
baseline operation. Next, we will start background ﬂows in
both link groups, and show that video performance severely
degrades.
Next, we will perform resource allocation by LGMs, ad-
justing the MAC parameters at each link group. Flow ta-
bles will show the current resource allocations, where the
allocation parameters are set diﬀerently for each technol-
ogy. Hence, although the underlying technologies are diﬀer-
ent, their speciﬁcs are hidden away from the upper layers.
Next, we start the video and the background traﬃc again
and conﬁrm that the video is not as severely aﬀected.
4. CONCLUSION
Heterogeneous wireless mesh networks will become an in-
tegral part of carrier-grade wireless networking. Resource
management and abstraction play a key role in utilizing dif-
ferent radio access technologies within the same infrastruc-
ture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demo
that shows how to expose the costs and capabilities of dif-
ferent radio access technologies to the upper layers, namely,
self-conﬁguration and routing.

Measurement and Monitoring
For managing wireless resources (e.g., computing current
link costs), a number of statistics is recorded at each node,
e.g., Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), channel utilization. Based
on these measurements, MoMa function generates link re-
ports, which might trigger changes by self-conﬁguration and
routing. The basic algorithm used by MoMa is as follows:
(1) After T1 seconds of silence from a neighbor, the link
is marked as Going Down. (2) If nothing is heard for an
additional T2 seconds, the link is marked as Down.
3. DEMO SCENARIO
To show how CARMEN abstracts the underlying hetero-
geneity in the network, we use the scenario depicted in Fig. 2,
where one CARMEN Access Point (CAP) acts as a standard
IEEE 802.11 client, several mesh nodes and laptops act as
CARMEN Mesh Points (CMP), and one additional laptop
performs monitoring and visualization of events.
