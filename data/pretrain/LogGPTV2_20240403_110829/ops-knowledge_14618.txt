User: In the "Memcache Viewer", is there any way to dump a list of existing keys? Just for debugging, of course, not for use in any scripts!
I ask because it doesn't seem like the GAE SDK is using a "real" memcache server, so I'm guessing it's emulated in Python (for simplicity, as it's just a development server).. This would mean there is a dict somewhere with the keys/values..
Assistant: The easiest way that I could think of, would be to maintain a memcache key at a known ID, and then append to it every time you insert a new key. This way you could just query for the single key to get a list of existing keys.
