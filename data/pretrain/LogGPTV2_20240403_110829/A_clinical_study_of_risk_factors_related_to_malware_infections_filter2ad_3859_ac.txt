We examined whether gender, age, employment/student
status, and work/study domain, and computer expertise had
102any relationship with likelihood of getting infected. To test
the impact of these characteristic and demographic factors,
we divided the users in two groups. The ﬁrst group contains
at-risk users, which are those who received at least one de-
tection, and the second group contains low-risk users who
received no detections during the experiment. Table 1 shows
the users distribution between the total population and the
at-risk group based on user characteristics and demographic
factors.

The results in Table 1 suggest that age and computer
expertise could potentially be risk factors for increased inci-
dence of infection. We therefore conducted statistical anal-
ysis to determine whether this was the case.
Prior to our analysis, we performed a residual analysis in
order to ﬁnd the presence of outliers among the data with
respect to the number of detections. The normal probabil-
ity plot of raw residuals, as shown in Figure 3, allowed us
to identify the presence of one outlier (who had 28 unique
detections), reducing the sample to 49 users.

We conducted a logistic regression analysis to assess if par-
ticular characteristic and demographic factors may increase
the infection risk. The dependent variable was the level of
risk (at-risk vs. low-risk groups). It was indicated by either
1 or 0, depending on whether the user was exposed to any
threats during the experiment. Results of the logistic re-
gression analysis are summarised in Table 2. Items in bold
are statistically signiﬁcant.
We also used one-way ANOVA tests to assess whether the
number of unique detections was aﬀected by the character-
istics and demographic factors. Results of the ANOVAs are
presented in Table 3. In all cases, we consider p < 0.05 as
statistically signiﬁcant.

Gender.
The total population included 30 males and 20 females
which gives a proportion of 60% and 40% respectively. Ta-
ble 1 shows that the gender distribution among the 23 at-risk
users is 61% for the males and 39% for the females. The lo-
gistic regression analysis revealed no statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between males and females (Table 2) with respect
to exposure to threats.
We next examined the number of detections to determine
whether there were any diﬀerences between the two groups.
Figure 4 suggests that there is a minor diﬀerence in the
average number of unique detections between males and fe-
males. However, statistical analysis reveals no statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between males and females for number
of unique detections (Table 3). While previous studies [15,
16] have addressed gender diﬀerence in computer security, to
the best of our knowledge, no empirical experiment has eval-
uated gender diﬀerences in risk of infection. Our statistical
tests suggest that gender is not a risk factor.
Age.
We divided our users into three age groups as evenly as
possible (although we note that the older age group has fewer
users due to our sample). Table 1 shows that the proportion
of 18 to 24-year-olds who are at-risk is almost the same as
for the total population. For those 25 to 35, the proportion
in the at-risk group (48%) is higher than for the total popu-
lation (38%). And for the group 36+ age group, we observe
a slight decrease of 7% in the proportion between the total
population and the at-risk group. Our logistic regression re-
103Status.
Participants were classiﬁed in three categories: students,
workers, or unemployed. Table 1 indicates that the propor-
tion between the total population and the at-risk group is
quite similar for each category. Logistic regression conﬁrms
that no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist.
Similarly, Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between
these categories and the number of detections. Results of
the ANOVA show no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences (Ta-
ble 3), further supporting that student/employment status
is not a risk factor.

dent/employment status
Work/study domain.
We recruited participants based on their domain of work
or study in order to have a representative sample. As shown
in Table 1, 26.5% of participants self-identiﬁed as being in
computer science/information technology ﬁelds, 47% in nat-
ural sciences and 26.5% in arts and humanities. Although
the table suggests that those in the Arts/Humanities might
be slightly more at-risk, results of the Logistic Regression
(Table 2) show no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the three groups.
Figure 7 presents the average number of unique detections
per domain.
Interestingly, it appears that participants in
the Arts/Humanities have fewer detections. However, these
diﬀerences were not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 3). Our
statistical tests provide no support indicating that domain
of work or study is a risk factor.
Computer expertise.
We assessed computer expertise by asking users about
their proﬁciency with certain technical tasks. Users were
considered to have a high level of computer expertise if they
had previously completed all of the following tasks: con-
ﬁgured a home network, created a web page, and installed
or re-installed an operating system on a computer. Over-
all, 18% of users were classiﬁed as computer experts for the
purposes of our analysis. As observed in Table 1, those with
high expertise were nearly twice as likely to be in the high-
risk group when compared to the total population. This
may indicate that a high level of expertise increases the risk
of exposure to threats. This was conﬁrmed by the logistic
Figure 4: Box plot of unique detections by gender
sults (Table 2) show no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence for
the impact of the age on exposure to threats.
We further investigated whether the number of detections
was impacted by age of the participant. Figure 5 mildly sug-
gests diﬀerences between age groups, however these results
were not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 5).
Unlike the previous studies mentioned in Section 2 [16,
21, 17] that concluded that younger users are more at-risk,
our statistical results suggest that age is not a signiﬁcant
risk factor. This discrepancy can be explained ﬁrst be-
cause the experimental methods are quite diﬀerent: all of
them involve surveys of users where susceptibility levels are
evaluated either through a theoretical model or from user
self-declarations of previous incidents, and not from actual
observation. Second, these results are not (all) speciﬁc to
malware infections. Finally, the granularity of the age data
recorded is diﬀerent (coarse in our case) so it is hard to
compare precisely these discrepancies, especially since the
age distributions are quite diﬀerent.
In any case, what is clear is that none of these studies,
including ours, can be used to make categorical statements
about risk and age, as all of these studies were based on
biased samples of the population, i.e. students and other
persons recruited on campus. Large scale studies with more
uniform population sampling will be required to settle the
issue of age as a risk factor for malware infections.

104Using a similar approach to that described in section 4.3.1,
we ﬁrst conducted a logistic regression analysis where users
were divided in two groups: at-risk and low-risk users. Sec-
ondly, we performed a general regression analysis to assess
if there was a relationship between the behavioural factors
analysed and the number of unique detections. General
regression analysis was chosen instead of ANOVA because
some of the independent variables represent continuous val-
ues (e.g. the number of gambling websites visited) rather
than categorical data. Table 4 summarises the statistical
results. Items in bold are statistically signiﬁcant.
Browser.
Each month, users were asked which web browser they
used most. We compiled these results in order to obtain for
each user the most frequently used browser for the entire
duration of the study. Table 5 summarises the proportion of
users who utilised each web browser for the total population
and the at-risk population. Even though a small increase is
observed between the two populations for Chrome, our lo-
gistic regression analysis revealed no statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the two groups with respect to the type
of browser used.

regression which shows that those with high computer exper-
tise were statistically more likely to be exposed to threats.
As illustrated in Figure 8, we further compared the num-
ber of detections between the high and low computer ex-
pertise groups. Higher variance is apparent for the high-
expertise group, but the diﬀerences are not statistically sig-
niﬁcant (Table 3). Our results suggest that while computer
experts are more likely to have at least one exposure to
threats, overall they do not see a higher number of detec-
tions.
We also studied whether the use of a speciﬁc browser may
inﬂuence the number of unique detections per user. To this
end, the results obtained from our general regression analysis
in Table 4 conﬁrm our previous ﬁndings. The usage of a
speciﬁc web browser is not related to the risk of infection.
Applications installed.
We monitored the number of applications installed by each
user. To assess the potential eﬀect of number of applications
on the risk of infection, we performed a logistic regression,
as shown in Table 4, which suggests that installing many
applications may increase the exposure to malware and thus
the probability of being infected.
This ﬁnding is also supported by our general regression
analysis which shows that number of applications installed
signiﬁcantly impacts the number of detections (Table 4).
The more a user installs applications, the more he is likely
to get infections, as illustrated in Figure 9. Our analysis
supports the idea that number of applications is a risk factor
for infection.
Websites visited.
The number of websites visited was also recorded for the
entire duration of the study to evaluate the impact on the
risk of infection. Figure 10 shows that at-risk users visited
many more websites than low-risk users, suggesting that vis-
iting many websites could potentially increase exposure to
threats. Logistic regression analysis conﬁrms this ﬁnding
(Table 4), showing that the number of websites signiﬁcantly
impacts the risk of exposure.

expertise
Summary of user characteristics.
In summary, we found little evidence linking user charac-
teristics to increased risk of threat exposure. Gender, age,
student/employment status, and domain of expertise showed
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences. However, we did ﬁnd
partial support linking high computer expertise to increased
risk of exposure.
4.3.2 Behavioural factors
To assess if speciﬁc user behaviours led to a higher risk of
infection, we focused our analysis on 4 variables: most used
browser, total number of applications installed, total number
of websites visited, and categories of websites visited.
