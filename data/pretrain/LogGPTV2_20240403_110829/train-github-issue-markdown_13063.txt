I've noticed one common piece of code when I have to write a redirect:
    return new RedirectResponse($this->router->generate('app.example', [...]));
What I would like to write is something similar to:
    return new RoutedRedirectResponse('app.example', [...]);
The actual route would be generated at a later stage and use the default
router.
