User: The environment is Emacs 24.1.1 on Ubuntu. using Ipython for python programming. 
The auto indent is works well when running ipython command on shell directly, but when i come to emacs run ipython there is no auto indent any more. and even worse when i type TAB it will prompt the Completion buffer.I also have searched this issue many times but still not found a practical method. as a result i have to enter space manually.
anyone could help to resolve this issue ? 
 1. auto indent on emacs ipython shell
 2. disable completion on emacs ipython shell separately.keep the Tab-completion work when i am not in ipython interactive shell.
Assistant: Any invocation of ipython-shell should do a correct setup.
