### Issue Description
I am working in an Emacs 24.1.1 environment on Ubuntu, using IPython for Python programming. When I run the `ipython` command directly in the shell, the auto-indentation works perfectly. However, when I use IPython within Emacs, the auto-indentation feature is not functioning. Additionally, pressing the `TAB` key triggers the completion buffer instead of inserting a tab or spaces. I have searched extensively for a solution but have not found a practical method to resolve this issue. As a result, I have to manually enter spaces for indentation.

### Specific Requirements
1. Enable auto-indentation in the Emacs IPython shell.
2. Disable the completion buffer for the `TAB` key in the Emacs IPython shell, while keeping the `TAB`-completion functionality intact when not in the IPython interactive shell.

### Current State and Suggested Actions
It appears that any invocation of the IPython shell should correctly set up the environment. If you are using `python-mode.el` (indicated by "Py" in the modeline), please ensure you are using the latest version from the trunk. You can do this with the following steps:

1. **Update `python-mode.el`**:
   - Ensure that Bazaar (bzr) is installed on your system.
   - Run the following command to get the latest version of `python-mode.el`:
     ```sh
     bzr branch lp:python-mode
     ```

2. **File a Bug Report**:
   - If updating `python-mode.el` does not resolve the issue, please file a bug report. This will help the maintainers identify and fix the problem.

### Additional Information
- **Emacs Version**: 24.1.1
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu
- **IPython Version**: Please specify if it is different from the default version for your setup.
