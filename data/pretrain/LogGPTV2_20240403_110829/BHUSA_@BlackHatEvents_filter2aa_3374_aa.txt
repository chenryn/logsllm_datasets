Why should we learn from history
1. Some exploit techniques are consistent over time
2. Thinking from the attacker's view allows for better defense
3. Historical cases have been carefully studied by the community
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents

Information Classification: General
Why should we learn from now
1.  A new disclosed vulnerability may have variants
•
CVE-2022-21882 is a variant of CVE-2021-1732
2.  A new targeted module will be fuzzed and audited by community
•
CLFS is heavily fuzzed and audited in the past two years
3.  An attacker may have some similar vulnerabilities in use or wait to use
•
Kaspersky discovered CVE-2021-28310 based on CVE-2021-1732
4. A new exploit technique tends to be used by attackers soon
•
“Pipe Attribute” in “Scoop the Windows 10 pool!” is popular after 2020

Antivirus

#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Antivirus 
⚫ The most powerful tool
•
Kaspersky have caught some itw Windows LPE 0days with their antivirus in the past few years
⚫ Pros
•
Deployed in large-scale real-world environments
•
Opportunity to extract encrypted LPE components
⚫ Cons
•
There are strong technical barriers
•
It is likely to be bypassed or detected
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Sandbox  
⚫ Another power tool
•
There are some successful experience on itw Office 0day hunting with the help of sandbox
⚫ Pros
•
The environment is highly controllable and can be freely configured
•
Behavior-based detection makes it accuracy
⚫ Cons
•
Easy to miss a Windows LPE sample (OS version check)
•
Huge resource overhead (More environments means more time and money)
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Sandbox  
⚫ Other disadvantages of sandbox on Windows LPE hunting
•
Some samples require parameters but the sandbox cannot provide valid parameters by default
•
For example, a process id
•
Some samples only lead to BSOD without subsequent behavior, which is difficult to detect
•
Such as a proof of concept (poc), or a sample running in a wrong system version
•
There is a cycle between sandbox development and deployment
•
Which will lead to missing the best detection cycle for some latest exploits
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
YARA 
⚫ Powerful static method
•
Widely used for malware hunting
⚫ Pros
•
Almost no technical barriers
•
No fear of various checks
•
Flexible in development and deployment
•
Low cost
⚫ Cons
•
It can easily lead to false positives and false negatives
