complements, rather than competes with, our approach.
To our knowledge, the only method in the related literature
that monitors solely raw sensor measurements to detect attacks on
control systems based on learned historical system dynamics is the
AR method used in [22]. In §4.4, we presented a comparison with
this method and showed that the results were in favor of pasad.
In particular, we showed that our method is less sensitive to noise
and is thus able to detect covert attacks in sensor signals that are
undetectable by AR.
6 CONCLUSION
Ensuring the security of cyber-physical systems requires the con-
sideration of all aspects of their operation. What makes them funda-
mentally different from traditional IT systems is that they interact
with the physical world. Accordingly, these systems are exposed
to attacks that aim to cause tangible impact on the underlying
physical process. We therefore acknowledged the importance of
implementing intrusion detection capabilities at the process level
as an advanced line of defense, and as a complementary measure to
the classical solutions implemented elsewhere. We approached the
problem by introducing a novel specification-agnostic technique
that is capable of detecting stealthy attacks by monitoring time
series of sensor measurements for structural changes in their be-
havior. We validated our approach by carrying out extensive tests
on new carefully crafted attacks in a simulation setting using the
popular TE model, a dataset generated by a physical ICS testbed,
and on data from a real ICS.

A
Proof that ||UT Px|| = ||Px||
Therefore, R (U) = R (UUT ) = R (P).
C
Proof that ˜U : R (U) → R (UT )
is an Isometric Isomorphism
Since UT P = UT from (11), and P = UUT from (1), what remains to
show is that
||UT x|| = ||UUT x||.
Let x be any vector in RL. Noting that the square Euclidean norm
is equal to the dot product of a vector with itself, we write
||UUT x||2 = UUT x · UUT x
= (UUT x)T (UUT x)
= xT U(UT U)UT x
= xT UUT x
= (Ux)T (Ux) = ||UT x||2.
Therefore, ||UUT x|| = ||UT x|| ∀x ∈ RL.
(·) in matrix notation
since UT U = I
B
Proof that R (U) = R (P)
First note that since all columns of U are linearly independent,
K (U) = {0}, which means that ∀ y ∈ K (U),
Uy = 0 ⇐⇒ y = 0.
(15)
We also have K (P) = K (UUT ) = K (UT ) since
x ∈ K (UUT ) ⇐⇒ UUT x = 0
⇐⇒ UT x = 0
⇐⇒ x ∈ K (UT ).
(by definition)
(by (15))
(16)
Finally,
x ∈ R (UUT ) ⇐⇒ x ⊥ K (UUT )
⇐⇒ x ⊥ K (UT )
⇐⇒ x ∈ R (U).
(by (1))
(by (16))
of its kernel K (UT )⊥ = R (U); i.e., ˜U = UT(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)R (U)
Recall that ˜U is the restriction of UT to the orthogonal complement
. Since ˜U : R (U) →
R (UT ) is a linear map, by definition it satisfies the following two
conditions:
) = ˜U(v) + ˜U(v′
)
˜U(v + v′
˜U(cv) = c ˜Uv
∀ v, v′ ∈ R (U)
∀ v ∈ R (U), c ∈ R.
Hence, ˜U is a homomorphism. For ˜U to be an isomorphism, it must
further be bijective, i.e., both injective and surjective.
To show that ˜U is injective (one-to-one), let v, v′ ∈ R (U) have the
same image w ∈ R (UT ), then it must be that v = v′.
Since w ∈ R (UT ) is the image of both v and v′ we have
w = ˜Uv = ˜Uv′
⇒ ˜Uv − ˜Uv′ = 0
⇒ UT v − UT v′ = 0
⇒ UT (v − v′
) = 0
⇒ v − v′ ∈ K (UT )
But v − v′ ∈ R (U), hence v − v′ ∈ R (U) ∩ K (UT ) ⇒ v − v′ ∈
R (U) ∩ R (U)⊥ = {0} ⇒ v − v′ = 0. Thus v = v′.
To see that ˜U is surjective, note that for every w ∈ R (U), there
exists v = ˜U+w ∈ R (UT ) such that ˜Uv = ˜U ˜U+w = UT Uw = w.
Therefore ˜U is a linear bijective homomorphism, or equivalently, a
linear isomorphism.
