User: How to monitor and prevent DDoS attacks? Please provide an appropriate solution.
Assistant: DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service Attack) refers to the use of multiple high-bandwidth servers or botnets to launch a large-scale traffic attack on a target server, causing the target server to fail to perform normal network services. The following is a solution to prevent DDoS attacks: 1. Traffic monitoring: Real-time monitoring of network traffic to detect abnormal traffic in time. You can use commonly used monitoring software or cloud solutions, such as CloudFlare, AWS Shield, Alibaba Cloud Shield, etc. 2. Limit request frequency: By setting a rate limit, limit the number of requests initiated by a single IP address or user within a certain period of time. 3. Configure firewall: set appropriate firewall rules to filter and intercept illegal traffic. 4. Load balancing: Distribute traffic through load balancing, disperse attack traffic, divert requests, and reduce the load and risk of a single server. 5. Use CDN to accelerate: CDN network can disperse traffic and slow down the impact of attack traffic on the main server. 6. Backup and disaster recovery: Redundant servers are established, and when the main server is abnormal, it can be quickly switched to the standby server to ensure the continuity of services. 7. Educate users: Improve user security awareness, prevent awareness of being attacked, and avoid masquerading attacks by phishing, malware, and Trojan horses. The damage caused by DDoS attacks to network services cannot be predicted and measured. Preventing DDoS attacks requires comprehensive strategies and cooperation. Comprehensively consider the application scenarios of the network, user interaction mode, system design, business requirements, budget capacity and other factors to select the way to prevent DDoS attacks.
