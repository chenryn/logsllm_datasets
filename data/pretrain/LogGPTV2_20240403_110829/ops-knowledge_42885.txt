To effectively implement CIS Control 1.4, "Use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Logging to Update Enterprise Asset Inventory," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Enable DHCP Logging:**
   - Ensure that DHCP logging is enabled on all DHCP servers and IP address management (IPAM) tools. This will capture detailed information about the devices that are assigned IP addresses within the network.

2. **Regular Log Review:**
   - Establish a routine process to review the DHCP logs. The frequency of these reviews should be at least weekly, but more frequent reviews may be necessary depending on the organization's size and the rate of change in the network environment.

3. **Update Asset Inventory:**
   - Use the information from the DHCP logs to update the enterpriseâ€™s asset inventory. This includes adding new devices, removing decommissioned ones, and verifying the accuracy of existing records.
   - Ensure that the asset inventory is kept up-to-date with the latest device information, such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other relevant details.

4. **Automate Where Possible:**
   - Consider implementing automated tools or scripts to parse the DHCP logs and update the asset inventory. Automation can help reduce the risk of human error and ensure that the inventory is consistently updated.

5. **Document and Train:**
   - Document the procedures for enabling DHCP logging, reviewing logs, and updating the asset inventory. Provide training to the relevant staff to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining the asset inventory.

**Additional Information:**
- **Asset Type:** Devices
- **Security Function:** Identify

By following these steps, an organization can maintain an accurate and up-to-date asset inventory, which is crucial for effective network management and security.
