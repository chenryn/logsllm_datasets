  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I have a `SnackBarController` component that I place at the root of my
`Router`, this is backed by a redux reducer with some actions that allow me to
open the `SnackBar` and pass properties to it for the message and such
### Custom Component
    class SnackBarController extends React.Component {
      render () {
        return (
           this.props.dispatch(closeSnackBar())}
            action={this.props.action}
            onActionClick={this.props.onActionClick}
          />
        );
      }
    }
### Actions
    export const SNACKBAR_OPEN = 'SNACKBAR_OPEN';
    export const openSnackBar = data => ({
      type: SNACKBAR_OPEN,
      ...data,
      open: true
    });
    export const SNACKBAR_CLOSE = 'SNACKBAR_CLOSE';
    export const closeSnackBar = data => ({
      type: SNACKBAR_CLOSE,
      open: false
    });
### Reducer
    import { SNACKBAR_OPEN, SNACKBAR_CLOSE } from "../actions/snackBar";
    const snackBarInitialState = {
      open: false,
      message: 'There was an error',
      autoHideDuration: 3000,
      action: undefined,
      onActionClick: undefined
    };
    export default (state = snackBarInitialState, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case SNACKBAR_OPEN:
        case SNACKBAR_CLOSE:
          const { type, ...rest } = action;
          return {
            ...state,
            ...rest
          };
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };
I then call the open action when for instance a promise rejects
    this.props.dispatch(openSnackBar({
      message: "Use next?",
      onActionClick: this.makeUpdates,
      action: 'Use',
      autoHideDuration: 6000
    }));
## Current Behavior
When I attempt to open a `SnackBar` this way, I only get a `SnackBar` with the
message and the timeout, no action button shows at all
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
https://codesandbox.io/s/jpy3opvr93
  1. Click button
  2. See that there is no action
## Context
Ideally this is supposed to allow me to control a snack bar from anywhere in
my application including within other action generators
