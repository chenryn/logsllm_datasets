User: I am complete Python newb here who is just making the switch from MATLAB. I installed the Anaconda 2.4 with Python 2.7 on a 64-bit Windows 8.1 system. But I cannot even start the program as I cannot find any Anaconda launcher either on the Start menu or the desktop. Any help please?
Assistant: The previous answer suggesting upgrading to Anaconda 4.0+ is probably sensible. However if this is not a desirable option, the below will allow use of Anaconda Launcher on previous versions.
Anaconda is installed under 'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Anaconda'.
The Anaconda Launcher can be open by clicking on the Start menu and typing Run (or hit Windows+r) and entering C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Anaconda\Scripts\launcher.bat and clicking OK. Alternatively you can navigate to 'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Anaconda\Scripts' in a command-prompt and enter launcher.bat.
You stated in a comment on another answer that you were "actually looking to open spyder". You can do this with Windows+r C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Anaconda\Scripts\spyder.exe or by navigating to 'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Anaconda\Scripts' in a command-prompt and typing python spyder-script.py.
If you're only ever after spyder, a taskbar shortcut with a pretty icon is always nice. To do this, go to 'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Anaconda\Scripts' in an Explorer window and drag spyder.exe to the taskbar, then if you right-click this and goto Properties then Change Icon... you can add the icon from 'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Anaconda\Scripts\spyder.ico'.
Hope this helps.
