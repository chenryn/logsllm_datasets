This log chunk, spanning from 2015-07-30 16:12:14 to 2015-07-30 18:18:02, documents the activities of a ZooKeeper server. The following is a detailed summary of the key events and issues:

1. **Session Terminations and Expirations:**
   - Multiple session terminations were processed by the `PrepRequestProcessor` component. For example, sessions with IDs `0x34ed9ac1c1e0085`, `0x14ed93111f200a7`, `0x34ed9ac1c1e0083`, `0x34ed9ac1c1e00ae` were terminated.
   - Several sessions expired due to inactivity. Sessions with IDs `0x14ed93111f2009f`, `0x34ed9ac1c1e008f`, `0x24ed931194200ad`, and `0x14ed93111f200d2` exceeded their 10,000ms (10 seconds) timeout and were expired.

2. **Socket Connections and Client Sessions:**
   - A socket connection for client `/10.10.34.21:51262` was closed, which had session ID `0x24ed931194200a0`.
   - New sessions were established. For instance, a session with ID `0x24ed931194200af` was established for client `/10.10.34.16:56646` with a negotiated timeout of 10,000ms.
   - Attempts to establish new sessions were logged. Clients at `/10.10.34.13:37600` and `/10.10.34.11:52866` attempted to create new sessions.

3. **Warnings and Exceptions:**
   - Warnings were issued for connection requests from old clients. These requests would be dropped if the server was in read-only (r-o) mode. For example, connection requests from clients `/10.10.34.30:60436` and `/10.10.34.11:58424` were flagged.
   - Multiple "end of stream" exceptions were caught by the `NIOServerCnxn` component. These exceptions occurred at different times, indicating potential issues with the network or client connections.

4. **Connection Requests:**
   - A connection request from `/10.10.34.13:33209` was received by the `QuorumCnxManager$Listener`.

In summary, the log captures the normal operations of session management, including terminations and expirations, as well as warnings and exceptions that may indicate transient network issues or client compatibility problems.
