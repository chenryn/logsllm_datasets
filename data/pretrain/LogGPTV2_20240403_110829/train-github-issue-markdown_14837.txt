# Bug report
## Describe the bug
static css files appear to be served with sub-optimal cache-control:
/_next/static/css/commons.4e4de3e2.chunk.css  
/_next/static/css/styles.4015be53.chunk.css  
served with:  
cache-control: public, max-age=0
I am new to Next.js behavior so apologies if this is not really a bug and css
chunk shouldn't be served max-age=31536000, immutable for some reason. I just
assume that the chunk hash (commons. **4e4de3e2**.chunk.css) ensure these
things could/should be immutable but I am ready to be educated.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. Go to any next.js page in chrome right click on any element and inspect element
  2. Right click on any element and inspect element
  3. Look at the network tab and click on a /_next/static/css
  4. See cache-control is "public, max-age=0"
## Expected behavior
I expect them to be served with "cache-control: public, max-age=31536000,
immutable" like everything else in the /_next/static seems to be served with.
## System information
  * OS: [e.g. macOS, Windows]
  * Browser: chrome
  * Version of Next.js: 7.0.2

I can provide this sample repo if this for some reason isn't immediately and
obviously reproducible.
