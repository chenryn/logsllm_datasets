HIGH
COGNITIVE LOAD
Passwords are still valuable compared to other options, and this is 
why they are the most common in security systems. 
However their cognitive load is ultimately caused by their weakness 
against observation.
THE PROBLEM 
WITH PASSWORDS
Passwords are subjected to observation
> need to have many passwords and change them frequently
> high cognitive load

PIN ENTRY TERMINALS

INTERACTION  HISTORY
Interaction history
In the past 40 years, the ATM terminals substantially did not change.
The interaction with the terminals did not change as well.
Observation is still one of the most common attacks!

hence easily attackable (i.e. shoulder surﬁng and camera attack)
The interaction is physically situated

PINS IN PREVIOUS WORK
Different people want different password schemes or input methods
PIN Entry by trapdoor game (Roth et al.)
Spy-resistant Keyboard (Tan et al.)
Haptic Passwords by Malek and Sasamoto
Gaze-Based Password (Kumar et al.)
PINS IN THE REAL WORLD
Despite all these new methods we still rely on keypads!
BASIC CONSIDERATIONS
We need to access public terminals, but it does not mean that
and the interaction must be done at the terminal
INTERACTING 
AT THE TERMINAL 
IS DANGEROUS
the interaction must be the same for all of us
DIFFERENT PASSWORDS
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS
ONLINE INTERFACE 
SECURITY IS ONLY A 
MINIMUM STANDARD
the interaction must be limited to the default interface

STRATEGY SHIFT
An alternative strategy is to decouple interaction in two parts: 
we separate the input method for a PIN from the communication 
of the password to a terminal.

A Tactile Password System
The Secure Haptic Keypad
Bianchi, A., Oakley, I., Kwon, D.S., The Secure Haptic Keypad: Design and Evaluation of a Tactile Password System.
In CHI 2010, ACM, New York, NY, pp. 1089-1092.
The Problem: Observation Attack
Authentication in public spaces is common
ATMs, entry door systems, quick ﬂight check-in kiosks, etc...
Stolen PINs pose a signiﬁcant risk to many systems
U.S. estimated yearly bank fraud amount s $60M
Motivations
Observation attack: “Shoulder-surﬁng” or “Camera-attack”

4: Haptic Obfuscation
Related Work
Multimodal systems: password information (i.e. textual and 
graphical passwords) can  be obfuscated using haptics, as an 
invisible channel.
Relies on a cognitive transformation/mapping.
Haptic-based Graphical Password (Malek et al.)
Undercover (Sasamoto et al.)
The idea: Haptic Password
A sequence of tactile cues (tactons),  
inherently invisible to everyone. 
Haptic password
System
Password Model
Passwords in the system take the form of a sequence of tactile 
feedback in the forms of vibrations (from a set of 3 possibilities)
System
Example of Haptic Password made of 3 tactons
1 Hz
2 Hz
Continuous
Our 3 Tactons
Haptic Keypad Overview
System
Keypad constructed of three physically independent buttons each 
capable of (1)sensing ﬁnger input and (2)rendering vibrotactile cues in 
the form of tactons and (3)accepting input selection.
Haptic Keys
System
Three identical hardware: 
(1) force sensing resistor (FSR) adjust the strength of the vibrotactile output
(2) linear coil vibrotactile actuators within the casing 
(3) physical switches for key selection
The Password Software
System
1. AVR micro-controller handles sensing, rendering and input.
2. The Haptic Keypad is connected to a computer via serial port.
3. Minimal GUI represents only completion progress
Interaction Model
System
Rules:
3 tactons are assigned to 3 keys (11 correspondence)
Tactons are randomized on keys after each entry.
Match input with password
System Randomize 
key-tacton assignment
User feels the keys and ﬁnds 
the only right tacton
User selects the tacton 
clicking the key
Example of Interaction
System
Password To match
With no interaction 
keys are silent

Security Objective
System
p(brute-force attack) = p(observation attack)
p(attack) =  
resilience to observation and brute-force attacks. 
Security Standard:
4 digit numerical 
password 
p(attack)= 1/10000
Evaluation: 2 studies
Evaluation
To gauge our interface we conducted 2 experiments
Pilot Study
Test tactons recognition rate
Evaluate if tactons are  
perceptually distinct
User Study
Evaluation of 3 software 
interfaces with the same 
hardware (Haptic Keypad)

authentication schemes to 
obtain some insight.
