I am following this guide on OS X:  
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/getting-
started-guides/vagrant.md
I am able to run other vagrant's using the same provider.
    $ ./cluster/kube-up.sh 
    Starting cluster using provider: vagrant
    ... calling verify-prereqs
    Can't find the necessary components for the vmware_fusion vagrant provider, please fix and retry.
