User: I wanted to update my python 2.6.1 to 3.x on mac but i was wondering if its possible to do it using terminal or i have to download the installer from python website? 
The reason why i am asking this question is because installer is not updating my terminal python version.
Assistant: First, install Homebrew (The missing package manager for macOS) if you haven': Type this in your terminal 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
Now you can update your Python to python 3 by this command
brew install python3 && cp /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python
Python 2 and python 3 can coexist so to open python 3, type python3 instead of python
That's the easiest and the best way.
