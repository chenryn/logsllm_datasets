User: On a Linux server, how to configure virtual hosts based on IP addresses?
Assistant: To configure a virtual host based on an IP address on a Linux server, the following steps need to be completed: 1. Edit the host name resolution file /etc/hosts, and add the mapping relationship between the IP address and the domain name to be configured, for example: ``` 127.0.0.1 localhost 192.168.1.100 example.com ``` 2. Enter the configuration file directory of the Apache server and open the httpd.conf file. 3. Find the Listen command and make sure to listen to all IP addresses and ports, as follows: ``` Listen 0.0.0.0:80 ``` 4. Find the VirtualHost command, add the IP address and the host name (or domain name) to be matched in the command , for example: ``` <VirtualHost 192.168.1.100> ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com ServerName example.com ErrorLog logs/example.com-error_log CustomLog logs/example.com-access_log common </ VirtualHost> ``` 5. Restart the Apache server to complete the configuration. In this way, when a website with an IP address of 192.168.1.100 is requested, the Apache server will return the webpage files in the /var/www/example.com directory. At the same time, you can continue to add other mappings between IP addresses and domain names in /etc/hosts, and configure corresponding virtual hosts in httpd.conf as needed.
