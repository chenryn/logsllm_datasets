plot in Fig. 17(d), and indicate that the accuracy was above
96.8% and was slightly affected by angles especially when
the angle is between 120 and 150 degree. We think that is
because the difference between the acoustic attenuation of
the three channels is the least when the speaker at the three
positions, and in a manner, reduce the accuracy. In summary,
EarArray also has a good performance on the smartphone
when the number of microphones decreases to three. In fact, as
the number of microphones increases and those microphones
were placed around the surfaces of smart device and facing
different directions, the acoustic attenuation will be measured
more sufﬁciently, thus, the performance of EarArray will be
better.
VI. RELATED WORK
As Voice Control Systems (VCSs) are playing a more
and more important role in our daily life, cyber attacks
against VCSs start to draw people’s attention. Regarding the
concealment feature of the attacks, current VCS attacks can be
divided into two types: audible and inaudible attacks. Inaudible
attacks, the attacker tries to approach the victim and plays
recorded audio to the victim device. The audio is usually
generated in a tricky way such that it is incomprehensible
to humans while comprehensible to the device. The audible
attacks are theoretically feasible but have limitations in practice
the audio used for attack is usually
due to the fact
distinguishable from white noise. In inaudible attacks,
the
attacker modulates malicious voice commands on ultrasonic
carriers, so the commands become inaudible to human ears,
but still receivable to microphones on VCSs duce to nonlinear
effects of microphone circuits. Inaudible attacks are a totally
imperceptible attack.

A. Audible Attack on VCSs

proposed for image recognition missions, due to their great

of using GANs in speech generation. Existing works have
proposed to use GANs for generating incomprehensible audio
commands to attack speech recognition systems [25], [28],
these malicious audio is disguised as some random noise so
the victim won’t be able to notice the attack. This work [26]
proposed a approach to deceive human’s ears by hiding an
executable voice command in adversarial audio which appears
to be simple music to human. Nicholas et al. [10], [11]
demonstrated that the targeted audio adversarial examples by
modifying existing audio can be generated, which introduce a
new domain to study adversarial examples. Based on the above
work, Metamorph achieves the over-the-air attack.
As speech biometrics recognition gradually takes place of
traditional identiﬁcation technologies [29], the newly devel-
oped automatic speaker veriﬁcation (ASV) systems can defend
traditional VCS attacks to some extent. However, the replay
attack still poses a great threat to these ASV systems, it can
bypass the veriﬁcation by simply replaying a pre-recorded
audio. Villalba et al. [30] presented many vulnerabilities of
ASV systems towards far-ﬁeld replayed attacks. In the anti-
spooﬁng competition ASV2017 [31], Witkowski, et al. [32]
pointed out that replay attacks can be detected by analyzing
the high-frequency band of the replayed recordings. Zeyan
et al. [33] improved the discriminating ability of the relative
phase (RP) features by proposing two new auditory ﬁlter-
based RP features for replay attack detection. To detect the
remote attaker, Lee et al. [12] proposed a sonar-based liveness
detection system. Speaker-Sonar emits an inaudible sound and
tracks the user’s direction and to compare it with the direction
of the received voice command. If the inaudible attack is
launched by a nearby and moving attacker, the sonar-based
method will fail.
B. Inaudible Attack on VCSs
Kasmi et al. [34] introduced a kind of new voice command
injection into modern smartphones using intentional electro-
magnetic interference with headphone cables. The limitation
is that the attack devices must be plugged into a smartphone.
DolphinAttack [14], [5], [8] translated typical audible voice
commands into ultrasonic frequencies making it inaudible to
the human ear, but still decipherable by the microphones and
the always-on voice assistants.
[14], [5] also proposed a
defense strategy from the software level based on audio feature
extraction. However,
the signal features vary signiﬁcantly
along with the different types of microphones. The defense
method in [35]depends on the nonlinearity of microphone
circuits, which is different from what we proposed, i.e., we
utilize the prorogation characteristic of sound in the air.
We have validated experimentally that nonlinearity is device-
dependent. For instance, amplitude skewness, one of the main
features used for nonlinearity, are valid with Sumsung Galaxy
S6 Edge+ but are not valid for iPhone 4S and iPhoneSE.
As mentioned in [36],
three
proposed features related to nonlinearity. He et al. [36]
designed a “guard” signal transmitter to detect and capture the
attack signal, it is also capable to neutralize the attack signal.
Light Commands [6] use light to inject commands into voice-
controllable systems by aiming an amplitude-modulated light
at the microphone’s aperture. To detect light-based command
injection,
the attack by comparing
is possible to conceal all
it
they attempt
to detect
signals from multiple microphones or add a barrier ﬁlm before
the microphone’s diaphragm to blocks straight light beams.
As only one microphone receives a signal while the others
receive nothing, EarArray also can be applied to detect the
Light Commands. SurﬁngAttack [9] injects the inaudible signal
using ultrasound propagation in solid media, by utilizing the
nonlinearity, the ultrasound signal can be demodulated and rec-
ognized by the speech recognition system. By monitoring the
frequency component in high frequency range, SurﬁngAttack
can be detected. Different from their method, EarArray utilizes
the difference in propagation attenuation between ultrasound
and sound to detect attacks. UltraComm [4] proposes an
approach for acoustic communication which different from
EarArray. It leverages nonlinearity effect of microphones
and transmit modulated data on frequency above 20 kHz and
recovers it in the audible frequency band.
Our work in this paper shows the distinguishing ﬁeld
features between the acoustic signals and high-frequency mod-
ulated signals. We analyzed different attack scenarios of smart
voice assistant and smartphones and implemented the defense
mechanism based on the analysis of sound ﬁeld features. In
contrast to the defense method mentioned in [35], [36], our
defense algorithm is more efﬁcient and it is instructive for the
design of microphone array in the future.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Voice assistants brought convenience to our daily life,
however, they have also exposed our privacy to a certain type
of various malicious attacks using inaudible voice commands.
In this paper, we proposed a light-weight mechanism named
EarArray to defend voice assistants against these inaudi-
ble voice command attacks. We theoretically analyzed the
attenuation property of audible voice command and inaudible
voice command and proposed to use sound ﬁeld distribution
as features to tell apart normal commands initiated by human
beings and inaudible command generated by machines. We
have conducted plenty of experiments to prove the feasibility
of EarArray, results show that EarArray can achieve
99% accuracy for attack detection, and 97.89% localization
accuracy for inaudible voice commands.
Our future work includes overcoming the problem that
mobile phones cannot read multi-channel data at the same
time, extracting ﬁeld patterns from more different types of
voice assistant devices, and hopefully generalizing our defense
algorithm for all voice assistant devices.
