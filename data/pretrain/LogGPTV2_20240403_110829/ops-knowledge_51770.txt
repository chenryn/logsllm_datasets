User: I'm trying to install easy_install and, well... see for yourself:

sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg
Processing setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg
Copying setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg to /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages
Adding setuptools 0.6c11 to easy-install.pth file
Installing easy_install script to /usr/local/bin
error: /usr/local/bin/easy_install: Permission denied

How do I give my computer permission to do this? I tried telling it in a friendly voice, "computer, I hereby grant you permission to install easy_install" but that didn't work.
Assistant: Judging from the paths displayed, you are likely using the Apple-supplied Python 2.6 in OS X 10.6.  If so, be aware that Apple has already easily installed easy_install for you in /usr/bin.  Just try typing easy_install; you may need to use sudo easy_install if the package tries to install a script.  If you are using another Python (one you installed yourself), you will need to install a separate version of setuptools (or the newer Distribute) for it.
