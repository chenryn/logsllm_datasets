One of the standout features of IPython is its ability to be embedded within a running program using the `IPython.embed()` function. This allows you to interact with and inspect the current state of the program at the point of embedding. Incorporating this functionality into the new REPL would greatly enhance its utility and provide a powerful tool for debugging and exploration.
