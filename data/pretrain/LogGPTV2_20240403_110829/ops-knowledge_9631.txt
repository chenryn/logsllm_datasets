User: Background:
I am a .NET developer trying to set up a python programming environment.
I have installed python 2.7.5. However I changed my mind and uninstalled 2.7.5 and installed python 2.7.6. 
If I CMD in windows command promopt, the python version is 2.7.6
When I start the cygwin shell and type:
python --version
It says 2.7.5, this version is was uninstalled. 
How do I get cygwin to understand it should use the new version. 2.7.6?
I believe there is commands to type in cygwin shell to solve this? Thanks on advance!
Assistant: Cygwin has its own option to install its own version of Python. If you run setup.exe and poke through the Development packages, you'll find it. You probably installed Python here as well, and are running it in Bash. If you use CMD, you're running a different version. The fact that the version numbers overlap is just coincidental.
