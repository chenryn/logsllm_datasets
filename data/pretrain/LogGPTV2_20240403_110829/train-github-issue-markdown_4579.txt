### Issue with TensorFlow Installation

#### Environment
- **Operating System:** Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]
- **Python Version:** 3.5.2 (v3.5.2:4def2a2901a5, Jun 25 2016, 22:18:55) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
- **pip Version:** 9.0.1 (latest available: 10.0.1)

#### Problem Description
When attempting to install and use TensorFlow, the following errors occur:

1. **Failed Installation of TensorFlow GPU Wheel:**
   - Command: `pip install "C:\tensorflow\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build\tf_python\dist\tensorflow_gpu-1.5.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl"`
   - Error:
     ```
     Requirement 'C:\tensorflow\tensorflow\contrib\cmake\build\tf_python\dist\tensorflow_gpu-1.5.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl' looks like a filename, but the file does not exist.
     tensorflow_gpu-1.5.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
     ```

2. **Upgrade Attempt:**
   - Command: `pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall tensorflow-gpu`
   - Output:
     ```
     Collecting tensorflow-gpu
     Cache entry deserialization failed, entry ignored
     Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/51/bc/29202147b513f0ed5fbdd40f05c6bc2a19722cfb4dd24d77a7c2080a06b4/tensorflow_gpu-1.9.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
     Installing collected packages: tensorflow-gpu
     Found existing installation: tensorflow-gpu 1.9.0
     Uninstalling tensorflow-gpu-1.9.0:
     Successfully uninstalled tensorflow-gpu-1.9.0
     Successfully installed tensorflow-gpu-1.9.0
     You are using pip version 9.0.1, however version 10.0.1 is available.
     You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.
     ```

3. **Import Error in Python:**
   - Command: `import tensorflow as tf`
   - Error:
     ```
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "C:\Users\Fritz\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py", line 18, in swig_import_helper
       return importlib.import_module(mname)
     File "C:\Users\Fritz\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35\lib\importlib\__init__.py", line 126, in import_module
       return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)
     ...
     ImportError: DLL load failed: Das angegebene Modul wurde nicht gefunden.
     During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
     ...
     ImportError: No module named '_pywrap_tensorflow_internal'
     Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.
     See https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources#common_installation_problems for some common reasons and solutions.
     Include the entire stack trace above this error message when asking for help.
     ```

#### Possible Causes and Solutions
1. **File Not Found:**
   - Ensure that the path to the `.whl` file is correct and the file exists.
   
2. **Unsupported Wheel:**
   - The wheel file `tensorflow_gpu-1.5.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl` may not be compatible with your Python version or system architecture. Consider downloading the appropriate wheel file from the official TensorFlow website.

3. **DLL Load Failure:**
   - This error indicates that a required dynamic link library (DLL) is missing. Common causes include:
     - Missing CUDA and cuDNN libraries if you are installing the GPU version.
     - Incorrect installation of Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, or 2019.
   - Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the environment variables (e.g., `PATH`) are set up properly.

4. **pip Version:**
   - Upgrade pip to the latest version using the command:
     ```
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```
