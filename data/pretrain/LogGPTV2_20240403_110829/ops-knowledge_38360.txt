User: In perl debugger I can use DB::get_fork_TTY() to debug both parent and child process in different terminals.  Is there anything similar in python debugger?
Or, is there any good way to debug fork in python?
Assistant: You can emulate forked process if you will set instead of fork and its condition (pid == 0) always True. For debugging main process debugger will work.
For debugging multi-processing interaction better to use detailed logs as for me
