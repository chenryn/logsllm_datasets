### Memory-Based Attack
- **Memory Modification:**
  - Techniques for modifying game memory to achieve desired outcomes.

---

### Benefits
- **Generic:** Can be applied to various types of games.
- **Fast:** Efficient execution.
- **Invisible:** Difficult to detect by standard means.

---

### Drawbacks
- **Structures are Hard to Find:** Identifying the correct memory structures can be challenging.
- **No Control Over the Flow:** Limited ability to control the game's flow.

**Game Memory Structures:**
- Understanding the underlying memory structures is crucial for successful manipulation.

---

### Background
- **Game Industry:** In 2009, 273 million games were sold.
- **Game Types:**
  - Action
  - First-person
  - Sport
  - Role-playing
  - Adventure
  - Strategy (35% of games sold in 2009)

### How to Cheat in an RTS Game
- **Manipulate Resources**
- **Manipulate Units**
- **Manipulate the Map**

---

### What is a Map Hack?
- **Definition:** A map hack involves altering the game's map data to gain an unfair advantage.
- **Philosophy:** "There is no spoon" – the idea that the game's reality can be bent to your will.

### Steps to Perform a Map Hack
1. **Reduce the Search Space:**
   - Play the game to understand its mechanics.
   - Discover the relevant memory areas.
   - Play more to refine the search.
2. **Acquire the Game’s Memory:**
   - Step 1: Remove unrelated memory.
   - Step 2: Discover the map and keep relevant memory.
   - Step 3: Remove more unrelated memory.
   - Step 4: Find the map in the remaining memory.
   - Working Assumption: Maps are stored in 2-D arrays.
3. **Isolate the Potential Map:**
   - Compare in-game and in-memory representations.
4. **Understand the Map’s Structure:**
   - Analyze the structure of the map data.
5. **Rewrite the Memory:**
   - Modify the map data for fun and profit.
6. **Handle Unexpected Effects:**
   - Be prepared for unforeseen consequences.
