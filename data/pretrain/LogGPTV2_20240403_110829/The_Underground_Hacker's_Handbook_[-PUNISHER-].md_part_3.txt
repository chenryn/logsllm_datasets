legitimacy. Some professional social engineers study the company
before attacking, so they might know all the answers. That’s why, if you
still have some doubts, you should ask the head of whatever
45
department the attacker is from to find out if he is legit. Better safe than
sorry.
Shoulder Surfing
When you type in your password make sure there is no one behind you
attempting to peak. If there is, turn around and drop kick him/her in the face. No
not really. Also, make sure you don’t keep any sticky notes laying around that
have your password or password hints on them.
Guessing
To prevent this attack from happening, never use a password like your birth
date, your mother’s maiden name, your pets name, your spouse’s name, or
anything that someone may be able to guess.
Dictionary Attacks
Dictionary attacks are very simple to prevent. Don’t use a password that is
in the dictionary. Some people may think that if they use a word from the
dictionary but replace most of the letters with a number, then they are safe. They
are not. There are 1337 speak dictionary’s out there too. Basically what 1337
speak is, is changing a word like “animal” to 4n1m41. For a secure password, I
would recommend using a phrase such as “doyoulikecheese?88”.
Brute-force Attacks
Brute-force attacks may be prevented by creating a very long password and
using many numbers and odd characters. The longer the password the longer it
takes for the hacker to crack your password. If after a few days the hacker hasn’t
been able to crack your password through a brute-force attack, then he is very
likely to just give up. Like I said in the dictionary attacks, creating a phrase for your
password is your best option for staying secure.
46
Rainbow Tables
You can avoid rainbow table cracking by simply making your password
extremely long. Creating tables for passwords that are long takes a very long time
and a lot of resources. That is why there aren’t many of these tables available.
Phishing
Phishing attacks are very simple to avoid. When you are asked to put your
personal information into a website, look up into the URL bar. If for example you
are supposed to be on Gmail.com and in the URL bar it says something completely
different like gmail.randomsite.com, or gamilmail.com, then you know this is a
fake. When you are on the real Gmail website, the URL should begin with
www.google.com anything else is a fake.

Footprinting
Footprinting is the act of gathering information about a computer system
and the companies it belongs to. Footprinting is the first step hackers take in their
hacking process. Footprinting is important because to hack a system the hacker
must first know everything there is to know about it. Below I will give you
examples of the steps and services a hacker would use to get information from a
website.
1. First, a hacker would start gathering information on the targets website.
Things a hacker would look for are e-mails and names. This information
could come in handy if the hacker was planning to attempt a social
engineering attack against the company.
2. Next the hacker would get the IP address of the website. By going
tohttp://www.selfseo.com/find_ip_address_of_a_website.php and
inserting the web site URL, it will spit out its IP address.
3. Next the hacker would Ping the server to see if it is up and running. There’s
no point in trying to hack an offline server. http://just-ping.com pings a
website from 34 different locations in the world. Insert the website name
or IP address and hit “Ping”. If all packets went through, then the server is
up.
49
4. Next the hacker would do a Whois lookup on the company website. Go to
http://whois.domaintools.com and put in the target website. As you can
see this gives a HUGE amount of information about the company. You see
the company e-mails, address, names, when the domain was created, when
the domain expires, the domain name servers, and more!
5. A hacker can also take advantage of search engines to search sites for data.
For example, a hacker could search a website through Google by searching
“site:www.the-target-site.com” this will display every page that Google has
of the website. You could narrow down the number of results by adding a
specific word after. For example the hacker could search “site:www.the-
target-site.com email”. This search could list several emails that are
published on the website. Another search you could do in Google is
“inurl:robots.txt this would look for a page called robots.txt. If a site has the
file “robots.txt”, it displays all the directories and pages on the website that
they wish to keep anonymous from the search engine spiders. Occasionally
50
you might come across some valuable information that was meant to be
kept private in this file.
Now that the basics of footprinting have been explained, we will
move on to port scanning.
Port Scanning
The point of port scanning a server is to detect its open ports the port’s
listening services. Once a hacker knows all the services running on your server, he
could search for possible vulnerabilities they may have and exploit them to take
control of your website. In the port scanning example we will use the most
popular port scanner: Nmap. The Nmap Security Scanner is available for both Mac
and Windows users: http://nmap.org/download.html . The example will be shown
using the Nmap GUI (Graphical User Interface). Otherwise known as Zenmap.
1. First the hacker would choose a target and place it in the target box. As you
can see the “Command:” section gets updated as well. This is what the
command would look like if you were running the CLI version.
2. Next the hacker would choose the “Profile:”, or in other words, the scan
type. A smart hacker would go with a quick and quiet scan. Full version
detection scans are very loud and could raise suspicion on the other end.
Stay away from those options because as you will see later on, there are
other ways to get that information.
51
3. A sample scan result may look like the following:
4. As you can see it found a few open ports and listed the services that are run
on them. Below I have a list of some of the most popular ports/services on
the internet.
20 FTP data (File Transfer Protocol)
21 FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
22 SSH (Secure Shell)
23 Telnet
25 SMTP (Send Mail Transfer Protocol)
43 whois
53 DNS (Domain Name Service)
68 DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol)
80 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
110 POP3 (Post Office Protocol, version 3)
137 NetBIOS-ns
138 NetBIOS-dgm
139 NetBIOS
143 IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
161 SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
52
194 IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
220 IMAP3 (Internet Message Access Protocol 3)
443 SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
445 SMB (NetBIOS over TCP)
1352 Lotus Notes
1433 Microsoft SQL Server
1521 Oracle SQL
2049 NFS (Network File System)
3306 MYSQL
4000 ICQ
5800 VNC
5900 VNC
8080 HTTP
5. Along with finding out what ports are running, the hacker needs to also find
out what operating system the server is running. There are always a lot of
operating system vulnerabilities out there to choose from. So by knowing
the operating system, the hacker’s chances of taking over the server go up.
As you can see, there is an option on Nmap to detect the operating
system, but this scan is very loud and easily detected so it is better to avoid
it if possible. A simple way to determine what the server is running is by
getting a 404 error page. You can get there by going to a page that doesn’t
exist. For example the hacker would put in
“www.targetsite.com/asdlfjasl.php” this page will most likely not exist and
bring him to the 404 page. On most sites the 404 error page displays the
server operating system along with its version. Many sites nowadays don’t
display this by putting up custom 404 pages so this may not always work.
6. If you are planning on using the CLI version of Nmap, or want a more in
depth look at all the commands take a look at the Nmap manual:
http://nmap.org/book/man.html .
7. Now that the hacker has got all the running services and open ports on the
targets system, he will now have to find out what versions the server is
running. This is where “Banner Grabbing” comes in.
53
Banner Grabbing
Now that the hacker has a full list of services running on the target system,
to be able to exploit them, he has to first figure out what software and version
the service is. One way the hacker can get this information, is to telnet into
service port. In the example below, we will use command prompt on Windows
(Start -> Run -> Type “cmd” -> Enter). If you are on a Mac, you will be using the
terminal. Note: If you are using Windows Vista, then telnet is not installed by
default. You can install it by doing the following simple steps.
Click Start then select Control Panel.
o
Select Programs and Features.
o
Select Turn Windows features on or off.
o
Select the Telnet Client option and click OK.
o
A box will appear to confirm installation. The telnet command should now be
o
installed
1. First, the hacker would choose one of the open ports that were revealed in
the Nmap scan to continue with and attempt to exploit. Let’s say that when
the hacker scanned his target, he found the port 21 open. As you can see
on the chart above, port 21 is FTP. To find out what FTP software is running
he would use telnet by running the command:
telnet www.targetsite.com 21
As you can see above, I ran this against my computer (localhost). So a
hacker would insert a target URL in place of localhost.
54
2. Next, it would connect to the target and display a banner telling the hacker
the software and its version as shown below. This is the information the
hacker needs to continue and begin searching for vulnerabilities for the
software discovered.
If the above method doesn’t work for you, then simply use Nmap’s full
version detection option to get the information.
Searching for Vulnerabilities
Now that the hacker has the name of the software being used and its
version number, he would take that information and search a couple vulnerability
databases for an exploit. If there’s an exploit available, he will run it against the
server and take complete control. If there isn’t any, he would move onto another
open port and try again on a different service.
Some of the most popular exploit databases are:
• Milw0rm
• SecurityFocus
• osvdb
55
By searching “filezilla” on milw0rm, fortunately the hacker won’t find any
exploits for my current version of the FTP software. Now most people would
move on to another port to try and find another possible vulnerability, but this
doesn’t mean every hacker will. If a skillful hacker is determined, he may try to
locate a vulnerability in the current software version and develop an exploit for it.
In the hacker community, this new vulnerability would be called a “0-day”. 0-day
vulnerabilities are very valuable in the hacker community for a few reasons.
• No one knows about the vulnerability, so the hacker could
start hacking hundreds of websites before the vulnerability is
discovered and patched.
• The hacker could sell the vulnerability for thousands of dollars.
• Discovering vulnerabilities and creating an exploit for it shows
that the hacker is very skillful and raises his ranks in the hacker
community.
You might be wondering why 0-days are worth so much. It’s very simple. I’ll
explain it with a simple equation.
Hacker + 0-Day + Company Servers = Bad Reputation = Loss of Money
Now before we get into the actual penetrations, I will discuss a couple of
the common type of attacks used against discovered vulnerabilities.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) – There are many types of DoS attacks, but they all have
one purpose: to make the target server unavailable for legitimate users. The most
common type of DoS attack is when the hacker sends a flood of information to
the target server causing it to use up all of its resources, and in return pushing it
offline, or causing it to deny requests from legitimate users trying to access it.
Buffer Overflow (BoF) – A buffer overflow happens when a program attempts to
store more data into a buffer, or a data storage area, then it was meant to hold.
Because the buffer was only meant to hold a certain amount of data, the extra
information overflows into other buffers causing them to be overwritten with
malicious code created by the hacker. Once this code is executed, the hacker can
receive full control of the server.
56
If you search the Milw0rm exploit database, you will see that in many exploit
titles it reads local exploit or remote exploit. Below are their definitions:
Local Exploit – To run a local exploit, you must first have access and privileges on
the machine. Local exploits are usually used to escalate ones privileges to admin
or root. In other words, it allows an ordinary user to gain root privileges.
Remote Exploit – A remote exploit is pretty much the same thing as a local exploit
except that it isn’t run locally, but launched from anywhere across the internet.
A hacker usually has to use a combination of both remote and local exploits to
gain full control of a system. For example, the hacker may have been able to gain
regular privileges with a remote exploit attack, and then be able to escalate to
root privileges with the help of a local exploit.
Penetrating
So now you might be wondering: Once the hacker finds the right exploit,
how does he go about running it against the target and penetrating the server?
This will all be explained in this chapter.
As you search Milw0rm or any of the other couple exploit database websites
provided in this chapter, you will notice that the exploits are created in many
different types of programming languages. Below I will list a few of the most
common programming languages used, and how a hacker would compile and run
them against a server.
PHP
PHP exploits are very common. PHP exploit code usually starts with  . Let’s say the hacker wanted to do some temporary damage to a
server running FTP Server 0.9.20. If he was to search milw0rm he would come up
with the following DOS exploit: http://milw0rm.com/exploits/2901 and run it
against the server. Below are the steps the hacker would take.
1. First the hacker would need to install PHP onto his computer. WAMP
is a free web server that comes with PHP. If you are using a Mac then
you must install MAMP . Next, paste the PHP exploit into notepad or
any word processor and save it as “exploit.php”.
57
You will have to know a little PHP to edit the target address. On line
13 of this exploit you will see:
$address = gethostbyname(‘192.168.1.3’); here you will have to edit
in the IP address of the target. Every exploit is different. Some you
have to know what to edit and some have runtime instructions. Save
this edited file into the PHP directory on your server that contains
the PHP executable file. In WAMP the directory would be
C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.2.5 , of course the last directory version
number changes with newer versions.
2. Next open up the command prompt or terminal if you are using a
Mac, and go to the PHP directory by using the CD (change directory)
command followed by the directory location.
3. Now it’s time to run the exploit. To run it simple type in “php
exploit.php” and hit enter. You should get a couple errors.
58
4. When skilled hackers create exploits, they sometimes insert mistakes
or extra code so that script kiddies with no programming knowledge
wouldn’t be able to use them. The above is a simple example. If you
go to line 18 of this exploit , will see the line
$junk.=”../../../sun-tzu/../../../sun-tzu/../../../sun-tzu”;
This line was inserted to throw off the script kiddies and by simply
removing it, the error will disappear. Just another reason why it’s
helpful to learn how to program.
Also every now and then you will receive other errors such as the
one the second picture shows above. These errors have to do with
the server configurations. Now as a hacker, you have to learn a lot on
your own. By going around asking simple questions like this all the
time will make you look bad and the most common response you will
receive: www.google.com . Google is your friend, so take advantage
of it! So starting now, begin to use Google, and if you are still stuck,
then you can ask help on community forums.
