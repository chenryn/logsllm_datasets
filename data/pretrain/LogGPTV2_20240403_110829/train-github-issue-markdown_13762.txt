It appears that the code is cloning two `#target5` elements into the `#left-well` container, instead of just one. The code snippet you provided should only clone and append a single element. Here is the correct and optimized version of the code:

```javascript
// Clone the #target5 element and append it to the #left-well container
$("#target5").clone().appendTo("#left-well");
```

If you are experiencing unexpected behavior, ensure that:
1. There is only one element with the ID `target5` in your HTML.
2. The `#left-well` container exists in the DOM when this script runs.
3. There are no other scripts or events that might be causing additional clones.

If the issue persists, please provide more context or the surrounding code for further analysis.
