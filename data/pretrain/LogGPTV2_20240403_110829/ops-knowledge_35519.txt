User: How to configure a secure remote server access environment through OpenSSH?
Assistant: 1. Use public-private key encryption authentication login: using the public-private key pair provided by OpenSSH can provide better remote access security. You can create a key pair per user on the server. The private key file must be located in the .ssh directory of the user's home directory, named "id_rsa", and must have read and write permissions. The public key file must be transferred to the remote server and appended to the .ssh/authorized_keys file in the user directory of the accessed server. 2. Prohibit using root user to log in: When accessing the server through SSH, it is forbidden to use root user to log in. A new user with sudo privileges can be created and authenticated on the remote server to continue using sudo to elevate to superuser. 3. Configure the firewall: the firewall can provide security protection for the server and prevent intruders from attempting to attack the server using common attack vectors. You can configure iptables or ufw on the server to limit the IP and service port connected to the server. 4. Enable SELinux: SELinux can implement the principle of minimum authorization to limit the permissions of the process, thereby enhancing the security of the server. It is recommended to enable SELinux on CentOS servers. 5. Update SSH configuration: By default, the SSH server may enable some unnecessary functions, and you need to disable those unnecessary and less secure options in the SSH server configuration file. For example, it is forbidden to use operation and maintenance skills to upload files to the SSH server, and the port for accessing the web management application is limited to local access, etc. 6. Fine-grained authorization: For users who need to execute specific commands on the remote server, please restrict their operation rights precisely. You can use tools like the sudoers tool to accomplish this task. 7. Use a VPN to connect to the server: A virtual private network (VPN) can provide more secure remote access because the VPN connection is encrypted and requires authorization for a specific endpoint. A secure connection can be ensured by configuring a VPN server on the server.
