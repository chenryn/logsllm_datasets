User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SQL Server: How do you check if it's safe to change the SA password? If I change the SA password for a Microsoft SQL Server, can I see in a log or a trace if some application somewhere is trying to log in with the old password?

Assistant: See this article/tutorial which explains how to enable login auditing in SQL Server 2000 and 2005:

Who is logging in as the sa login in SQL Server?


  The native audit level configuration
  is a simple configuration that can
  help to determine if the sa login is
  used in the SQL Server instance.  What
  this configuration does is records all
  of the successful (or failed or both)
  logins into a particular SQL Server
  instance.  You will not know the host
  name, application, etc.  However, this
  configuration will enable you to
  determine if the sa login is being
  used in the first place.  Once you
  have this information, then you can
  dig deeper with SQL Server Profiler
  outlined below.


For SQL Server 2008 there is a new feature "SQL Server Audit". The following article explains how to autid logins including example scripts: SQL Server Audit in SQL Server 2008.
