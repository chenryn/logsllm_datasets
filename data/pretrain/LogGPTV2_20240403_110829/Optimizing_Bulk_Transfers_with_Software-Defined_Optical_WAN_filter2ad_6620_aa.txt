Abstract
Bulk transfer on the wide-area network (WAN) is a funda-
mental service to many globally-distributed applications. It
is challenging to efﬁciently utilize expensive WAN band-
width to achieve short transfer completion time and meet
mission-critical deadlines. Advancements in software-deﬁned
networking (SDN) and optical hardware make it feasible and
beneﬁcial to quickly reconﬁgure optical devices in the opti-
cal layer, which brings a new opportunity for trafﬁc manage-
ment on the WAN.
We present Owan, a novel trafﬁc management system that
optimizes wide-area bulk transfers with centralized joint con-
trol of the optical and network layers. Owan can dynamically
change the network-layer topology by reconﬁguring the op-
tical devices. We develop efﬁcient algorithms to jointly op-
timize optical circuit setup, routing and rate allocation, and
dynamically adapt them to trafﬁc demand changes. We have
built a prototype of Owan with commodity optical and elec-
trical hardware. Testbed experiments and large-scale simula-
tions on two ISP topologies and one inter-DC topology show
that Owan completes transfers up to 4.45× faster on average,
and up to 1.36× more transfers meet their deadlines, as com-
pared to prior methods that only control the network layer.

search engines need to synchronize search indexes between
data centers; ﬁnancial institutions need to backup everyday
transactions over remote sites; media companies need to de-
liver high-deﬁnition video content to multiple distribution
areas. Bulk transfers have large size (terabytes to petabytes)
and account for a big proportion of trafﬁc, e.g., 85–95% for
some inter-datacenter (inter-DC) WANs [1, 2, 3, 4].
Optimizing bulk transfers is important to network opera-
tors. Although bulk transfers are not as delay-sensitive as
interactive trafﬁc like web queries, it is beneﬁcial and some-
times necessary to ﬁnish them quickly, as it is essential for
service quality. For instance, the time to ﬁnish search index
synchronization directly impacts the search quality [3]. Fur-
thermore, some bulk transfers are associated with deadlines,
e.g., timely delivery of high-deﬁnition video content to some
cities by a certain time is the key for business success [3,
4]. It requires network operators to carefully schedule these
transfers in order to meet their deadlines.
Existing practice performs trafﬁc engineering (TE) in the
network layer. Traditional WAN designs over-provision the
network with 30–40% average network utilization, in or-
der to handle trafﬁc demand changes and failures [1]. Re-
cent designs like Google B4 and Microsoft SWAN leverage
software-deﬁned networking (SDN) to directly control the
network with a global view [1, 2, 3, 4]. They use a global
TE to dynamically change routing and rate allocation, so that
they can accommodate more trafﬁc and meet more dead-
lines. They all assume a ﬁxed network-layer topology.
In a modern WAN, the network-layer topology is con-
structed over an intelligent optical layer.1 By reconﬁgur-
ing the optical devices, the operator can dynamically change
the network-layer topology. Figure 1 shows an example of
a modern WAN infrastructure—the Internet2 network [5].
The network-layer link between SEA and LA in Figure 1(b)
is implemented by an optical circuit that traverses multiple
optical switches in the optical layer in Figure 1(a). In prac-
tice, a WAN router is connected to an optical switch called
Reconﬁgurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) via
short-reach wavelength. To connect two WAN router ports,
the operator needs to properly conﬁgure the ROADMs along
the path to establish an optical circuit. By changing the cir-
cuits in the optical layer, operators can change which two
router ports are connected.

higher throughput. This signiﬁcantly reduces the number
of changes we need to make in the optical layer, in order to
update the topology.
We build a Owan prototype using commodity optical and
electronic hardware. The prototype has nine sites and em-
ulates the Internet2 topology in Figure 1. We conduct ex-
tensive evaluations through both testbed experiments with
our prototype that emulates the Internet2 network and large-
scale simulations with data from an ISP network and an inter-
DC network. Our results show that Owan improves the trans-
fer completion time by up to 4.45× on average and 3.84×
at the 95th percentile, as compared to prior methods that
only control the network layer. Furthermore, Owan allows
up to 1.36× more transfers to meet their deadlines and up to
2.03× more bytes to ﬁnish before their deadlines.
2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
We focus on bulk transfers on the WAN. Our design ap-
plies to both private WANs (e.g., inter-DC WANs) and pub-
lic WANs (e.g., provided by ISPs). Large ISPs usually own
both the public WAN and the underlying optical network.
They can directly use Owan to manage their networks. Small
ISPs and private WANs usually lease optical circuits from
optical-network providers. In such case, they would need an
interface with the optical-network operator to change the op-
tical conﬁgurations together with Owan. Furthermore, Owan
requires to know the trafﬁc demand and to control the rate of
each transfer, which can be assumed for inter-DC networks
but not for ISP networks. To use Owan in ISP networks, ISPs
can provide a bulk transfer service to their clients. This ser-
vice has an interface for clients to submit transfer requests
that contain trafﬁc demand information and inform clients
data rates they can use for their transfers. Before we intro-
duce Owan, we give some background on WAN infrastruc-
ture and a motivating example to show the beneﬁts of joint
optimization of the optical and network layers.
2.1 Background on WAN Infrastructure
A typical WAN infrastructure consists of network routers,
optical devices, and ﬁbers. A bulk transfer enters a WAN on
a router from an access network (e.g., a data-center network
or a metro network) or other autonomous systems, passes
through intermediate routers to the destination router, and
leaves the network. Since a WAN link is a circuit in the
optical layer, packets over any WAN link actually traverse
multiple optical switches in the form of optical signals.
Optical layer: An optical network consists of ROADMs
connected by ﬁber pairs. Today’s commercial ROADM tech-
nology is able to support 80 or more wavelengths per ﬁber
pair and 40 Gbps (100 Gbps, and higher with high-order
modulations and digital coherent receivers) per wavelength,
which leads to 3.2 Tbps (8 Tbps, and even higher capacity)
per ﬁber pair. A router port can connect to a ROADM port
with a tunable optical transponder via standard short-reach
wavelength. The tunable optical transponder is able to tune
the standard wavelength to another speciﬁc wavelength. The
ROADM can switch the wavelength to an output port or an
Figure 1: WAN infrastructure example (Internet2 [5]).
Traditionally, the optical layer is reconﬁgured on a long
time scale, e.g., weeks to months, or even years. The major
reason is the labor and risk involved in the reconﬁguration:
operators need to deal with sophisticated conﬁgurations, in-
cluding IP, BGP and access control list (ACL), and they have
to perform operations on many routers without consistent
conﬁguration interfaces, which is tedious and error-prone.
Also, after a optical layer reconﬁguration, traditional dis-
tributed routing protocols may be slow to converge.
In this paper, we present Owan, a new trafﬁc manage-
ment system that optimizes wide-area bulk transfers with
centralized joint control of the optical and network layers.
We leverage two technology trends. The ﬁrst is SDN that
allows direct control of network devices and simpliﬁes net-
work management; the second is modern ROADM devices
that allow fast remote reconﬁgurations (e.g., provisioning a
circuit in tens to hundreds of milliseconds [6]). Owan or-
chestrates bulk transfers in a centralized manner.
It com-
putes and implements the optical circuit conﬁguration (the
optical circuits that implement the network-layer topology)
and the routing conﬁguration (the paths and rate allocation
for each transfer) to optimize the transfer completion time or
the number of transfers that meet their deadlines.
A major technical challenge for Owan is that the opti-
mization problem includes a large number of constraints,
some of which are integral. Most TE algorithms assume a
given topology and only compute the network-layer conﬁg-
uration [1, 2, 3, 4]. While there is research on reconﬁgurable
optics, these projects focus on data center networks under
the assumption of speciﬁc optical devices (e.g., MEMS switches)
and certain topologies [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, there are
three unique constraints on WANs that do not present in data
centers: ROADMs, regenerators and arbitrary topology. We
accommodate ROADMs in our formulation which are typ-
ically used as building blocks for WANs. We take into ac-
count regenerators, which regenerates optical signals after
certain distance. Also, we do not make any assumptions of
the optical-layer topology, allowing it to be irregular.
The key idea to solve the optimization problem is to do
a probabilistic search in the search space with simulated an-
nealing. At each time slot, we use the current topology as the
starting point, and use simulated annealing to ﬁnd a topol-
ogy with the highest total throughput. There are two major
beneﬁts. First, searching for a topology, instead of the en-
tire optical and routing conﬁgurations, substantially reduces
the search space. Second, using the current topology as the
starting point in simulated annealing allows us to ﬁnd a tar-
get topology that is close to the current topology but has

(a) Internet2 physical infrastructure. (b) Internet2 IP layer topology. SEA LA lengths at O0 are multiplexed to the ﬁber to O1, with the ﬁber
between O0 and O2 carrying no wavelengths (Figure 2(c)).
In the network-layer topology, a router has both ports con-
nected to another router (Figure 2(d)), doubling the capacity
between R0 and R1 from conﬁguration A (Figure 2(b)).
2.2 Motivating Example
Topology reconﬁguration opens a new opportunity for op-
timizing bulk transfers. Existing approaches assume a given
and ﬁxed network-layer topology, and optimizes bulk trans-
fers by controlling the routing and/or the rate of each trans-
fer [1, 2, 3, 4]. We provide a motivating example to show
that by reconﬁguring the topology we can signiﬁcantly re-
duce average transfer completion time (Figure 3).
In the example, we have four routers R0-R3 similar to
Figure 2. We only show the network-layer topology and omit
the ROADMs for brevity. We have two transfers, F0 and
F1. Each transfer has 10 units of trafﬁc to send. Plan A
only controls routing (Figure 3(a)). It uses the shortest paths
and the two transfers are transmitted simultaneously. The
average transfer completion time is 1 time unit.
We can do better if we can control the sending rates too.
Plan B (Figure 3(b-c)) schedules F0 ﬁrst with two paths, R0-
R1 and R0-R2-R3-R1, and let F0 wait.
It takes 0.5 time
unit for F0 to ﬁnish. Then F1 starts and takes another 0.5
time unit to ﬁnish. The average transfer completion time is
2 = 0.75 time unit, or 1.33× faster than Plan A.
