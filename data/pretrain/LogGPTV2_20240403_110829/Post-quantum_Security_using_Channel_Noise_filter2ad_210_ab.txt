In seeded encryption systems, the ciphertext of a message m
is ECCT (S|| fS (U , m)), where ECCT is a capacity-achieving error
correcting code (for channel T), and fS (U , m) is the secrecy coded
block, where U is the randomness of encoding. For these codes, the
effective (ϵ, δ )-FLR (item 3 in definition above) will be replaced by,

In modular constructions, an error correcting code is used to
provide reliability for the receiver channel. This code slightly af-
fects parameters of the secrecy coding part of the construction,
which makes the finite-length analysis of the wiretap encryption
dependent on the choice of the error correcting code. To avoid this
dependency, and focus on the secrecy coding part, we introduce an
ideal error correcting code for a degraded wiretap channel.
An ideal error correcting code, denoted by IdECC (W), for a
degraded wiretap channel (W = W′ ◦ T), is an error correcting code
with a pair of encoder and decoder, (IdEnc, IdDec), satisfying the
following properties: for a message x of any length,
(i) IdDec (T(IdEnc (x))) = x, and (ii) IdDec (W(IdEnc (x))) = W′(x),
and (iii) the rate of the code is fixed for all message lengths.
In other words the ideal encoder, (i) allows perfectly reliable
transmission over the receiver channel T for any message, and (ii) it
partially removes noise from the eavesdropper’s channel resulting
in the eavesdropper channel W′(x) for Eve, and allows Eve’s view
Z to have (possibly stronger) correlation with the message, and (iii)
the required redundancy of the error correction is proportional to
the message length. Figure 1 illustrates the effect of an ideal ECC
on a degraded wiretap channel.
Because of the constant rate of the code for all message lengths,
for comparing the performance of wiretap codes over the wiretap
channel (T = BSCp1 , W = BSCp2 ), one only needs to compare its
performance over the wiretap channel (T = BSC0, W′ = BSCp ).
3 RESULTS
To obtain the effective rate, F LR
(ϵ ), of a construction we need
to derive the encryption block length for a given message length b,
at secrecy level ϵ = 2−σ , in the noiseless main channel setting. For
ItE, we will use an expression in [13] (Expression (7)) that relates
these parameters. For the HtE construction, the expression (2) in
Theorem 3.1 gives the required relation.

Theorem 3.1. We prove the following two results for a wiretap
channel when the main channel is noiseless.
(1) HtE construction provides semantic security for a wiretap chan-
nel (with noiseless main) when the eavesdropper’s channel is
additive.

(2) When the eavesdropper’s channel is BSCp, for semantic se-
curity level σ, the length of the randomness k satisfies the
following inequality,
2σ = (k + b)h2(p) − log 5(
To obtain the seed length that is required for the encoder, the
extractor should be specified. For ItE, the hash function family
Hmult
: {0, 1}r +b × {0, 1}r +b → {0, 1}b is used which, on seed
S ∈ {0, 1}r +b\0b+r and input X ∈ {0, 1}b+r , outputs the first b
bits of X ⊙ S. Here, ⊙ is multiplication over GF (2b+r ). For HtE, a
variation of this extractor is used in [10, Lamma 4] that for inputs
X1 ∈ {0, 1}b and X2 ∈ {0, 1}k the seed length is max(b, k ). We use
these two instantiations to calculate and compare effective rates of
HtE and ItE constructions.
Figures 2 and 3 graph the FLR of the constructions, as a function
of message length, for security levels σ = 32 and σ = 64 bits,
respectively. We consider a single block encryption. Comparing
the constructions for a fixed eavesdropper’s channel (fixed p in
BSCp) shows that for small p and very small message block lengths,
ItE slightly outperforms HtE. However, for larger message lengths
and/or noisier eavesdropper’s channel, when p ≥ 0.15 and b ≥ 5000,
F LR
(ϵ ) for HtE is always higher than for ItE.

4 CONCLUSION
Modular wiretap coding provides long-term security with efficient
computation and communication, and therefore is an attractive
solution for post-quantum communication security in an IoT setting.
This approach can be viewed as complementing and enhancing end-
to-end communication security of the system.
We compared the finite-length rate of two modular coding schemes
(HtE and ItE) that provide semantic security. Both these schemes
have computationally efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.
Our results showed that in most cases HtE has a higher finite-length
rate than ItE. We derived the length of the encrypted secure block
for typical IoT message blocks.

The break in the graphs associated with HtE is because the seed
length is given by max{b, k}, and for each noise level, as the message
length increases, there is a value of b for which s = max{b, k} = b.
