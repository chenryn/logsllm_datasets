User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Online backup : how could encryption and de-duplication be compatible? A "soon to enter beta" online backup service, Bitcasa, claims to have both de-duplication (you don't backup something already in the cloud) and client side encryption.

A patent search yields nothing with their company name but the patents may well be in the pipeline and not granted yet.

I find the claim pretty dubious with the level of information I have now, anyone knows more about how they claim to achieve that? Had the founders of the company not had a serious business background (Verisign, Mastercard...) I would have classified the product as snake oil right away but maybe there is more to it.

Edit: found a worrying tweet : https://twitter.com/#!/csoghoian/status/113753932400041984, encryption key per file would be derived from its hash, so definitely looking like not the place to store your torrented film collection, not that I would ever do that.

Edit2: We actually guessed it right, they used so called convergent encryption and thus someone owning the same file as you do can know wether yours is the same, since they have the key. This makes Bitcasa a very bad choice when the files you want to be confidential are not original. http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/bitcasa-explains-encryption/

Edit3: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/729/is-convergent-encryption-really-secure have a the same question and different answers

Assistant: I haven't thought through the details, but if a secure hash of the file content were used as the key then any (and only) clients who "knew the hash" would be able to access the content.

Essentially the cloud storage would act as a collective partial (very sparse, in fact) rainbow table for the hashing function, allowing it to be "reversed".

From the article: "Even if the RIAA and MPAA came knocking on Bitcasa’s doors, subpoenas in hand, all Bitcasa would have is a collection of encrypted bits with no means to decrypt them." -- true because bitcasa don't hold the objectid/filename-to-hash/key mapping; only their clients do (client-side). If the RIAA/MPAA knew the hashes of the files in question (well known for e.g. specific song MP3s) they'd be able to decrypt and prove you had a copy, but first they'd need to know which cloud-storage object/file held which song.

Clients would need to keep the hash for each cloud-stored object, and their local name for it, of course, to be able to access and unencrypt it.

Regarding some of the other features claimed in the article:


"compression" -- wouldn't work server-side (the encrypted content will not compress well) but could be applied client-side before encryption
"accessible anywhere" -- if the objid-to-filename-and-hash/key mapping is only on the client then the files are useless from other devices, which limits the usefulness of cloud storage. Could be solved by e.g. also storing the collection of objid-to-filename-and-hash/key tuples, client-side encrypted with a passphrase.
"patented de-duplication algorithms" -- there must be more going on than the above to justify a patent -- possibly de-duplication at a block, rather than file level?
the RIAA/MPAA would be able to come with a subpoena and an encrypted-with-its-own-hash copy of whatever song/movie they suspect people have copies of. Bitcasa would then be able to confirm whether or not that file had been stored or not. They wouldn't be able to decrypt it (without RIAA/MPAA giving them the hash/key), and (particularly if they aren't enforcing per-user quotas becausrer they offer "infinite storage") they might not have retained logs of which users uploaded/downloaded it. However, I suspect they could be required to remove the file (under DMCA safe harbour rules) or possibly to retain the content but then log any accounts which upload/download it in the future.
