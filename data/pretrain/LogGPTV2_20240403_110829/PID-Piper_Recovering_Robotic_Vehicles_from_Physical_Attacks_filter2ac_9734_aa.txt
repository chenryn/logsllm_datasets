Abstract—Robotic Vehicles (RV) rely extensively on sensor
inputs to operate autonomously. Physical attacks such as sensor
tampering and spooﬁng can feed erroneous sensor measurements
to deviate RVs from their course and result in mission failures.
In this paper, we present PID-Piper, a novel framework for
automatically recovering RVs from physical attacks. We use
machine learning (ML)
to design an attack resilient Feed-
Forward Controller (FFC), which runs in tandem with the RV’s
primary controller and monitors it. Under attacks, the FFC takes
over from the RV’s primary controller to recover the RV, and
allows the RV to complete its mission successfully. Our evaluation
on 6 RV systems including 3 real RVs shows that PID-Piper
achieves high accuracy in emulating the RV’s controller, in the
absence of attacks, with no false positives. Further, PID-Piper
allows RVs to complete their missions successfully despite attacks
in 83% of the cases, while incurring low performance overheads.

I. INTRODUCTION
Autonomous Robotic Vehicles (RVs) such as Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones) and Unmanned
Ground Vehicles (UGVs, also known as rovers) are widely
deployed in a variety of industrial sectors e.g., agriculture,
surveillance, package delivery, warehouse management, and
space exploration [1]–[5]. RVs rely extensively on their on-
board sensor measurements for autonomous operations.
Unfortunately, RVs have been shown to be vulnerable to
physical attacks. These are attacks that maliciously perturb
RV sensor measurements through physical means. Common
physical attacks against RVs are GPS spooﬁng by transmitting
false GPS signals [6], [7], and gyroscope [8], and accelerom-
eter [9] tampering through acoustic noise injection. Physical
attacks can have severe consequences such as crashing the RV,
or signiﬁcantly deviating it from its course and preventing it
from reaching its destination, resulting in mission failure [10].
There have been many techniques proposed for detecting
physical attacks in RVs [10]–[13]. However, upon detecting
the attack, these techniques either raise an alarm and trigger
the fail-safe modes of the RV (e.g., forced landing for drones),
or require manual remediation [14]. Unfortunately, this often
leads to failure of the RV’s mission (i.e., RV does not reach
its destination, or crashes). Because RVs are projected to be
deployed in mission-critical tasks such as drug delivery [3],
[15] and disaster relief [16], they need to recover from physical
attacks (henceforth, by attacks we mean physical attacks), and
complete their missions. Therefore, the recovery technique
should steer the RV to its destination and allow it to complete
its mission, without requiring any manual remediation.
In this paper, we propose PID-Piper1, a framework for auto-
mated attack recovery in RVs by using a secondary controller
in tandem with the RV’s primary controller. PID (proportional-
integral-derivative) control is the primary controller in au-
tonomous RVs [17]. We design PID-Piper based on two
observations we made. First, PID control is designed to handle
faults such as sensor noise and environmental disturbances by
compensating for the resulting errors (e.g., increase thrust to
minimize drift due to wind). However, it over-compensates for
the sensor perturbations due to attacks, which are systematic
in nature, causing the RV to deviate from its course and result
in mission failures. Secondly, PID controllers perform a series
of calculations based on the RV’s inputs (e.g., target position)
and sensor measurements (e.g., linear and angular position)
to derive the actuator signals. However, these calculations are
very sensitive to changes in the sensor’s inputs, which often
cause large variation in the outputs (i.e., actuator signals). This
is due to the high collinearity among the input parameters.
PID-Piper addresses the above weaknesses of PID con-
trollers through two innovations. First, it uses a Feed-Forward
Controller (FFC), as opposed to a Feed-Back Controller
(FBC) (used by all the prior work in this area [10], [13], [14]).
Unlike an FBC, which relies on the primary PID controller
to correct the RV’s trajectory, an FFC predicts the potential
disturbances (due to attacks) and directly rectiﬁes the RV’s
trajectory to compensate for them. This allows it to avoid the
over-compensation problem of PID. Second, we use Machine
Learning (ML) to learn the appropriate model for predicting
the PID controller’s output, and we use feature engineering to
avoid the high collinearity problem of PID. Thus, PID-Piper
can accurately predict the behavior of the PID controller under
normal (attack free) operation, while being resilient to attacks.
PID-Piper runs the ML-based FFC in tandem with the
PID controller, and monitors the deviation between both the
controllers. If this deviation exceeds a pre-deﬁned threshold,
it signals an attack, and switches the RV’s output from the
1PID-Piper leads RV towards their mission targets despite attacks, and
hence the name (pronounced Pi(e)d Piper).

PID controller to the ML-based FFC until the attack subsides.
This allows the RV to recover from the attack, and complete
the mission successfully. We call these attacks overt attacks
as they cause explicit disruptions in RV missions.
However, attackers can also mount stealthy attacks that
cause deviations in the RV’s trajectory in a controlled manner,
and over time can cause signiﬁcant disruptions in RV mis-
sions [18]. Because such attacks cause controlled deviations
under the threshold, they will not trigger detection, and hence
recovery is not possible. Compared to prior work, PID-Piper
derives a precise model of the RV using ML techniques,
and hence sets tight detection thresholds. This allows it to
signiﬁcantly limit the effects of stealthy attacks.
To the best of our knowledge, PID-Piper is the ﬁrst technique
that automatically recovers the RVs from overt attacks, and
limits the effects of stealthy attacks, to achieve mission success.
Our contributions in this paper are:
• We propose the use of FFCs for detecting and recovering
from physical attacks against RVs, which directly rectiﬁes
the actuator output based on the model’s predictions.
• We design a ML-based model for the FFC, and use
feature engineering to make it resilient to attacks.
• We design PID-Piper, a framework to integrate the ML-
based FFC controller with the PID controller. PID-Piper
uses the latter’s output in the absence of attacks. However,
it monitors the deviation between them, and switches to
the former’s output if the deviation exceeds a speciﬁed
threshold, thereby detecting an attack.
• We evaluate PID-Piper on 6 RVs - 3 simulated systems,
and 3 real RVs (2 drones and a rover) on a wide range of
missions, and subject them to overt and stealthy attacks.
We ﬁnd that (1) PID-Piper achieves high accuracy in pre-
dicting the RV’s runtime behaviour i.e., comparable to the PID
controller, during normal operation (in the absence of attacks),
and incurs 0% false positives. (2) PID-Piper successfully
recovers the RV under overt attacks, and completes the mission
in about 83% of cases (on average). while prior work [14]
does so in only 13% of the cases. Further, PID-Piper incurs
