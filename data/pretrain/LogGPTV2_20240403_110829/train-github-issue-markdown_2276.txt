If a responsive navbar (i.e., with a collapse data-toggle, etc, as in the
examples) lacks a brand element, then the menu items are not positioned
correctly on a small screen, instead appearing too high, with pull-right menu
items partially overlaying the nav-collapse button.
The presence of a navbar-brand element, even an empty one, seems to avoid the
issue.
