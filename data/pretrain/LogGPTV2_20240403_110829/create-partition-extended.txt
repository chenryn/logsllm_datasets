### Create an Extended Partition

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `create partition extended` command creates an extended partition on the disk that is currently in focus. After the partition is created, the focus automatically shifts to the new partition.

**Important Notes:**
- This command can only be used on Master Boot Record (MBR) disks.
- You must first use the `select disk` command to select a basic MBR disk and shift the focus to it.
- An extended partition must be created before you can create logical drives.
- Only one extended partition can be created per disk.
- Attempting to create an extended partition within another extended partition will result in an error.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
create partition extended [size=<size>] [offset=<offset>] [align=<alignment>] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **size=**  
  Specifies the size of the partition in megabytes (MB). If no size is specified, the partition will continue until there is no more free space in the extended partition.

- **offset=**  
  Specifies the offset in kilobytes (KB) at which the partition is created. If no offset is specified, the partition will start at the beginning of the free space on the disk that is large enough to hold the new partition.

- **align=**  
  Aligns all partition extents to the closest alignment boundary. This is typically used with hardware RAID Logical Unit Number (LUN) arrays to improve performance. The value is the number of kilobytes (KB) from the beginning of the disk to the closest alignment boundary.

- **noerr**  
  For scripting purposes only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart will continue to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Examples:**

To create an extended partition of 1000 megabytes in size, use the following command:
```plaintext
create partition extended size=1000
```

This command will create an extended partition of 1000 MB on the selected disk.
