User: Can someone help me in installing python package "Prophet" on windows 10 . 
I tried installing python 3.5 and the dependency 'pystan' but yet I get below error.  

"The package setup script has attempted to modify files on your system that are not within the EasyInstall build area, and has been aborted.This package cannot be safely installed by EasyInstall, and may not support alternate installation locations even if you run its setup script by hand.Please inform the package's author and the EasyInstall maintainers to find out if a fix or workaround is available.
  Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in c:\users\suman\appdata\local\temp\pip-build-aqoiqs\fbprophet\"`
Assistant: I faced the same issue and my solution was to:-

Create a new environment with Python3.5


conda create -n pht python=3.5 anaconda

Install Prophet using the command.


conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet


I didn't install 'gcc' although this was advised before installing Prophet.
