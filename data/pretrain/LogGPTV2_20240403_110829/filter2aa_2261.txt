The Year of HD Voice -- 2010
Who, what, where, how?
(Actually, who, how, where, what)
Doug Mohney - Background
• Following the ICT sector for over two decades
• Writing for Boardwatch, The Inquirer, VON 
Magazine (Pulvermedia), TMC
• Started HD voice coverage in May 2009
• Launch of HD Voice News (HD Connect Now) 
in August 2009
The 2009 HD voice wake-up call
• France Telecom deployments
– Broadband: Over 500,000 G.722 VoIP endpoints
– Mobile: AMR-WB deployed in Moldova
• Global Crossing
– Built HD conference bridge for customer
– Working on open HD conferencing bridge
• Verizon Business
– Close to 5,000 phones at HQ
– Expects early adopters in 2010, general availability in 2011
• Cablevision (Optimum Lightwave)
– Deployed hosted HD voice service in 2H09
Yes…
• Once again, the United States of America is 
being outclassed by the rest of the world in 
telecommunications technology….
Or…
• U.S. carriers will wait until the smoke clears 
and then get a deal because someone else has 
done the hard R&D…
Who: Companies in HD voice 
“ecosystem”
• IP desktop handset manufacturers – ALL major
– Aastra, AudioCodes, Avaya, Cisco, Polycom
• Mobile handset manufacturers
– Nokia, Sony Ericsson declared, anyone with Android & 4G, 
others to come

What is HD Voice? First--
• What is narrowband voice?
– Acoustic standards set in 1937
• Since ‘37, FM radio, TV, CD, HDTV, HD radio…
– PSTN grade call = 3.4 kHz range
– 300 Hz to 3400 Hz
– G.711 is VoIP equivalent, 64 kbp/s bandwidth
What is HD voice?
• Also known as wideband voice
• Range of at least 7 kHz sampling; i.e. twice the 
range of G.711 
• G.722 codec is baseline HD voice:
– 30 Hz to 7000 Hz
– 2x PSTN/G.711
– Still only need 64 kbit/s
• Other HD voice codecs include AMR-WB, SILK, 
GIPS iSAC.

Benefits from HD voice
• Reduction of fatigue
– Narrowband clipping means brain plays “fill in the 
blanks” in the background
– More data = less brain strain
– A reason why long conference calls suck!
• Better compensation and clarity
– Similar-sounding words like "sail" and "fail" 
– Acronyms are “notorious” for garbling
• End up having to repeat and/or spell out
HD Voice is much more than a codec..
• Typically an all-IP application
• Requires capable speakers & microphones
– PSTN can’t handle wideband
– You can fake it on mobile network with the right gear
– SIP for interoperability
• Need good QoS, low latency
– If you can’t do vanilla VoIP…
• On large scale, need agreements to interconnect 
via SIP for seamless HD calling, transcoding
between HD codecs
How do you get HD voice to talk to the 
PSTN? To other HD voice users?
• Different codec types – Transcoding
– HD voice to PSTN/G.711/G.729
– G.722 to AMR-WB, SILK, iSAC
• Same codec type
– On same LAN
– Interconnection via SIP
HD voice and the island problem
• Service providers don’t do SIP 
peering/interconnect/federations out of the box-
– Security considerations (SPIT, DDoS, you name it)
– ENUM is overhead
– Quality of Service
– Settlements (i.e. who gets cash)
• As a result, there are many HD voice islands:
– In enterprises
– At service providers
Building bridges to HD voice islands
•
Can peer (direct relationship)
– Service provider to service provider
– IP Peering Alliance
•
Group of independent hosting business VoIP guys
– Cloud Communications Alliance
•
Smaller group of guys in IP peering alliance sent out press release
•
Interconnection service
– Spoke and hub network
– Hub service provider
•
Manages ENUM lists
•
Technical, business, and legal management
– Xconnect ran HD voice trial in April-June timeframe
•
Many participants in the Cloud Communications Aliance
– Sprint PIN network 
•
Doing vanilla VoIP
•
Could do other SIP (HD voice, video) if Sprint figures out what to do with PIN
Back to HD voice codecs
•
G.722
–
Based on G.711, people wanted better voice
–
Patents expired, now anyone can use it
•
AMR-WB aka G.722.2
–
Cellular industry wanted HD, based on AMR
–
Designed to conserve RF usage, 24 kbit/s for HD
–
Need to pay VoiceAge (and Nokia, FT, Ericsson) for patent
–
Currently nearly exclusively in cellular domain, but being pushed to wireline
•
iSAC
–
Google BOUGHT GIPS in May for $68 million
–
Proprietary (today) by Global IP Solutions (GIPS)
–
Licensed for use by AOL, Yahoo, QQ, Nimbuzz, WebEx, IBM Lotus, Citrix Online
–
Will Google open source one or more GIPS HD voice & video codecs???
•
SILK
–
Skype wanted “superwideband” codec with variable bit-rate adaptability based on CPU and 
network availability
–
Royalty-free license
–
Samples between 8 to 24 kHz, use 6 to 40 kbit/s 
And still more HD voice codecs…
•
G.722.1 / Polycom Siren)
–
Royalty-free usage, not open source. 
–
Bit-rates from 16 to 32 kbit/s
–
Billions of minutes of usage on Vivex. 
•
Fraunhofer Audio Communication Engine (ACE) 
–
Include specifically designed MPEG codec “AAC Enhanced Low Delay”
•
“CD quality audio” at “very low coding delays and bitrates” 
–
Pitched for 4G/LTE usage, other parts of toolkit include echo control software, IP streaming 
stack and error concealment tools.
–
Why yes, you do have to pay royalties
•
Speex
–
Open source patent-free
–
Sampling from narrowband (8 kHz) to wideband and ultrawideband
–
Can use bitrates from 2 to 44 kbit/s
•
Broadcom BroadVoice
–
Offered royalty-free and open source under GNU (C, floating & fixed, GNU LGPL 2.1)
–
Wideband at 16 kHz sampling, 32 kbit/s, narrowband 8 kHz sampling, 16 kbit/s 
Why people fight over codecs
•
Hardware designers
– Simpler is better, fewer codecs, less expense to test and support
– On wireless side, less cycles = more battery life
•
Wireless crowd
– Old guard: Every little RF bandwidth is sacred 
• But this goes out the door with 3G/4G!!
• Some say this with a straight face as they prepare their pitch slides for 
streaming video, two-way conferencing…yah, WTF
– Lean on the device CPU to compress (AMR-WB, SILK)
•
Network core
– More codecs, more transcoding between formats
– Service providers prefer to NOT transcode as it costs money & has 
potential to lose HD voice goodness in translation between HD codecs
•
Developers
– Programmers all think they can write something better.
Apps that love HD voice
• Conferencing the “Killer App”
– Clarity, less stress, identify voices, accents less of a 
barrier
• Multi-national conversations for bonus dollars
– Non-native speakers of language can
• Be understood better
• Better understand what is being said much better
• Transcription (i.e. voice to email)
– Computer-based fewer errors
– Human, same thing, easier, less replaying
Apps that should love HD voice
• Better IVR/anything processing voice
• Young and old
– Young (under 3) have squeaky voice, don’t 
understand on a phone call
– Old, don’t hear so well; HD adds back some clue
• Public safety/national defense
– Better 911 calling
– Better translation/understanding of intercept

Why use HD? Today’s apps
• Service provider attraction/retention
• Conferencing
• Multi-national
• As a part of a UC play
Service providers
• Attraction
– Better quality voice than narrowband, other carriers
• Retention
– Better quality product keeps people from switching (i.e. 
keep churn down)
– France Telecom not charging extra for bband HD
• Differentiation
– Set apart from everyone else… until everyone else gets it
• Monetization
– Pay for better quality (?) Nobody knows
• Pre-pay vs post-pay interesting to watch
Conferencing – HD voice’s killer app
• Clearer communication
– Don’t have to repeat acronyms
• Less stressful
– People focus on content, not figuring out what is 
being said
• Can identify individual voices easier
Multi-national/multi-lingual
• BIG winner for Fortune 500/international 
businesses
• Non-native speakers can understand what is 
being said better/easier
– Clearer speech, no clipping of similar sounds, 
don’t have to guess/interpret 
• Can understand non-native speakers better
– Accents much less of a factor because there’s no 
clipping. 
Unified Communications
• Rolled in as “yet another feature” in a UC play
• Better voice quality provides
– Clearer voice mail messaging
– More effective transcriptions
• Voice to email
• Less human work/intervention in voice-based 
work products (Health care, legal, financial)
– Cablevision/Optimum Lightpath’s play in NY
Higher Education
• Desire to work with “leading edge” 
• Large campus deployments
• Deployments of 5,000 (and more) end-points 
– Penn State
– Texas Tech
How does HD progress?
