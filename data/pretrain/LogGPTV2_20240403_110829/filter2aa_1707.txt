Overview
Nosey Bastards!
All About Packet Normalization
Working It All Out
Putting It Into Practice
Finishing Up
Network Defenders
We see scans and probes of our network every 
day
From the inside and from the outside
Everybody is targeting us
Identifying our assets
How They Do It
Network stack implementation is highly 
discretionary
Differences identify the operating system type 
and version
Allowing Attackers to identify their targets
By matching the headers of their target to known 
operating system implementations
… then it’s likely a 
Windows 2003 
Sever!
Uses the following 
options
MSS of 1460
Single NOP
Window Size 0
Single NOP
Single NOP
Ending SACK
If your target …
Has a TTL of 128
Implications
If they identify your assets …
They know their weaknesses
How to attack them successfully
Without triggering your sensors
TSA-Style patdowns …
It’s fact of life
But does it have to be?
Why can’t we …
Remove the differences
To remove their advantage 
Strip them of their ability to fingerprint 
To significantly reduce their chance of success 
My Answer
Packet
ization
OK.  What is packet normalization?
Not an entirely developed concept
Many expressions but most incomplete …
Normalization vs. Scrubbing
Scrubbing is to do away with; cancel 
Normalization is to make normal, especially to 
cause to conform to a standard or norm
Both are seen in varying degrees
Scrubbing
Used by a number of firewalls
Randomize IP ID
Clear IP DF
Also …
Set IP tos/dscp, and ttl
IP Fragment Reassembly
Primarily Concern
Policy Violations
Abnormal Packets
Abnormal Flows
Scrubbing
Used by some network devices such as Cisco ACE and 
ASA
Random TCP SEQ
Clear TCP Reserved, and URG
Clears TCP Options
Minimum IP TTL
Fragment Reassembly too …
Primarily Concern
Policy Violations
Abnormal Packets
Abnormal Flows
Incoming Normalization
Used by IPS and IDS devices
IP Fragment Reassembly
IP TTL Evasion
Primarily Concern
Detect Attacks
Detection Evasion
Masquerading
Examples
IP Personality
Morph
IP Morph
Pretends to be …
Modifies the stack
Host Only
Outgoing Normalization?
Fingerprinting Process
TCP, UDP, and ICMP probes are sent
Compile results into fingerprint
Compare against database
Identify operating system
Where to Start?
Nmap fingerprint database
What about other fingerprinting tools?
xprobe2
SinFP
Vulnerability scanners … Nessus, Others
Best to disrupt any existing patterns
Clear out any unnecessary values
IP ToS/DSCP/Traffic Class Cleared
IP ECN Cleared
TCP URG Flag and URG Pointer Cleared
Randomize anything that you can
IP ID
IP TTL/HOP Limit?  TCP Options?
Scrubbing
Packet Normalization
Outgoing Normalization
Normalizing
(IP Time-To-Live / Hop Limit)
Make some assumptions
Originally Well-Known TTL
Decrements Only
Traveled < 32 hops
Back into Original Starting TTL
Estimate number of hops traveled
Recalibrate current TTL
Using Starting TTL of 255
Normalizing
(IP Time-To-Live / Hop Limit)
Start with the lowest well known TTL first!
Several exceptions to this normalization …
Will be discussed later
Normalizing
(TCP Options)
Assumptions
Only Few Well Known Options Needed
Order is unimportant
Requirement …Values can’t be changed
Read necessary options
Discard the rest
Rewrite options in proper order
NOP … till the end of the options
Normalizing
(TCP Options)
Options selected … And their order
MSS
Window
SACK
MD5 … if present
After processing …
Making everyone look the same
Putting It All Together
With IDGuard
Selecting The Platform 
Identified Suitable Hardware
Already Modified By Others
Documentation Available … Mikrotik Routerboards
Identified Suitable Operating System
Available Base
Writeable File System …OpenWrt
Deploying to Hardware 
Purchase the hardware from a local vendor
Create a netboot image for the RB450G
Setup dhcp & tftp netboot environment
Connect to the routerboard
Configure routerboard for DHCP
Netboot routerboard and flash
Load kernel module manually or
with a package
Configure Firewall
Deploying to Hardware 
OK … What worked?
I am really tired of those nosey bastards!
What Didn’t Work
ToS/DSCP/Traffic Class Clearing
ECN Clearing
URG Flag and URG Pointer Clearing
IP ID Randomization
DF Clearing
… the Scrubbing
What Worked
TTL Standardizing
TCP Option Standardizing
… the Normalization

TCP Options Sensitivity?
Link-Local Routing Protocols
Concern
Upstream Fragmentation

“Fragmentation Needed” ICMP Message Received
Host is confused

IDGuard Clears DF
Concern
Downstream Fragmentation
Each fragment given a different IP ID

IDGuard Excludes Fragments
Concern
TTL Attenuation
Packet travels more than 32 hops
Not all these hops are accounted for …
Packet TTL is continually extended
Routing Loop occurs
Resolution
Access Switch Placement
Concern
TTL Special Uses
TTL recalibrated
TTL never runs out
No Intermediate hop reports
Traceroute fails
Resolution
IDGuard Excludes ICMP Echo
Requests
IDGuard Excludes the UDP
traceroute range
Concern
Link-Local Routing Protocols
RIP packets have a TTL of 1
TTL of 255 is abnormal
Packet is malformed

What’s Next
More Platforms
Open-Source Router Firmware
Linux-Based Switches
Production Trials
Talk to vendors
Accurate target identification is key to a 
successful attack
Identification that is way too easy for an attacker 
to perform
Let’s change that with fingerprint prevention
I’ve proven that it can be done
Now, we just have to make it happen
