title:blackhat:asia-21 Hunting Vulnerabilities of gRPC Protocol Armed Mobile/IoT Applications
Google's open source network communication protocol, gRPC has been used by thousands of mobile applications, including some IoT devices, and supports tens of billions of network services every day. Unlike the traditional Https protocol, gRPC is faster, more secure and more usable. Through research, it was found that due to the reliability of the private protocol, developers often ignore the security verification mechanism of the application itself, causing a large number of security vulnerabilities in some applications.The main reasons for these problems: In mobile applications, when developers use the gRPC protocol, they usually don't pay attention to the integrity and reliability of the data sent by the mobile application. Because the application uses ssl certificate verification and data signature verification, it ignores the security logic behind the server application.During this talk, we will introduce a method for automatic fuzz of vulnerabilities in the mobile application server interface. Through this method, in the past year, we have discovered hundreds of vulnerabilities in the application interfaces of hundreds of millions of users, including serious vulnerabilities such as SSRF, command execution, and unauthorized access to logic.
