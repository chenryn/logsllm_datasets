  * Electron version: 0.37.5
  * Operating system: Linux
We recently switched to Electron 0.37.5 for VS Code and changed our build
scripts to replace ffmpeg with the version you guys offer as separate
download. Our understanding is that this version is built with the target
"chromium" as opposed to "chrome" and thus includes less codecs.
Surprisingly though the ffmpeg.so file for Linux is almost double the size for
the separate download compared to what is included in the release.
Maybe the scripts are flipped and the separate download actually is the one
built with "chrome" as target?
