## Abstract
The Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Vision 2020 (JV2020) is a comprehensive, multi-service planning document for future warfare. It necessitates the integration of several key avionics developments, including network-centric battlefield management, the coordination of hundreds of thousands of distributed processors, high assurance Multi-Level Security (MLS) in the battlefield, and low-cost, high-assurance engineering. This paper presents the results of a study and modeling of a new security architecture, MLS-PCA, which offers a practical solution for JV2020. The architecture leverages advances from the DARPA Polymorphic Computing Architecture (PCA) and introduces a new distributed process-level encryption scheme.

The paper outlines a functional model and a verified formal specification of MLS-PCA, ensuring high assurance within the constraints imposed by PCA software and hardware. Additionally, it demonstrates a feasible mapping of the MLS-PCA model to PCA hardware. Designed to support up to 500,000 CPUs, as predicted by Moore’s Law for the year 2020, the paper concludes with a description of an ongoing proof-of-concept implementation using a 100-node Grid Computing system and an MLS distributed targeting application.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation
### 1.1 DOD Joint Vision 2020
DOD Joint Vision 2020 envisions a future battlespace where space, air, land, sea, and undersea forces are integrated via a global network of sensors, command and control, communications, and integrated strike warfare elements. The critical challenge in this network-centric vision is achieving high assurance Multi-Level Security (MLS), which enables the numerous communications required for effective operations. Despite significant research and development over the past two decades, the high cost and lengthy certification processes have hindered the deployment of high assurance systems. 

### 1.2 Polymorphous Computing Architecture (PCA)
Innovative use of Polymorphous Computing Architecture (PCA) can address these MLS requirements at a process-level granularity. PCA aims to create a transparent reactive layer between embedded avionics applications and malleable micro-architecture elements. This layer will enable the development of software and hardware in a cooperative, constraint-sensitive environment, rather than the traditional, failure-prone "hardware first, software last" paradigm. The PCA program will develop a family of malleable micro-architecture processing elements that can reconfigure to match changing mission and scenario demands.

### 1.3 Character of Avionics
Legacy military avionics systems were developed using a federated architecture, where each subsystem was logically and physically separate. This approach, used in the F-15, F-16, and F/A-18 in the 1970s, led to inefficiencies and inflexibility. In the early 1980s, the "Pave Pillar" architecture introduced a more integrated approach, allowing computational resources to be interconnected and shared. However, sharing information in a classified environment poses significant challenges, such as operating at "System High" or solving the MLS problem. Current methods do not provide high assurance separation of different security levels.

Future avionics systems will consist of a large number of interconnected processors, with software operating in a distributed manner across thousands of processors. The growing need for multilevel systems in coalition environments makes high assurance MLS a critical requirement.

### 1.4 System High Limitations
Operating at "System High" is not a viable solution for future integrated battlefields. Weapon systems, sensors, and personnel will generate multiple secure data streams at different security sensitivities, which must be managed in an MLS manner. Clearing all battlefield personnel to "System High" is impractical, making high assurance MLS essential.

## 2. The MLS Problem
There are few Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions to meet high assurance MLS requirements. Building a high assurance trusted MLS system from scratch is not attractive due to the broad avionics requirements, the disarray in DOD Certification and Accreditation (C&A) processes, the lengthy C&A timeline, and the potential inability to meet real-time avionics needs. Traditional MLS approaches are also too expensive, necessitating a new approach.

## 3. Moore’s Law Predicts a Wealth of CPUs
Modern aircraft today have over 1,000 computers on board, with many more supporting ground operations. These systems are packaged into discrete units with shared power systems, interconnect busses, and external communications. As predicted by Moore’s Law, the number of CPUs available by 2020 will be substantial, requiring a scalable and secure architecture like MLS-PCA.

## 4. MLS-PCA Characteristics
Key to avionics security is creating dynamic trusted connections between processes, not just between processors. MLS-PCA moves encryption to the process level, using an Encryption Process Element (EPE) interposed between an Avionics Application Process (AAP) and the communication channel. A Network Security Element (NSE) controls Inter-Process Communication (IPC) by distributing encryption and authentication keys to the EPEs.

This approach ensures that security is based on trusted cryptographic elements, rather than untrusted software intermediaries. By moving encryption to the process level, MLS-PCA creates trusted application connections, providing a robust and flexible security solution for future avionics systems.
