User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题FastCGI Error Access to the script denied I have a Debian Squeeze server running nginx + php-fpm + fastcgi. I have a typo3 installation on this server which runs well.

No I installed OTRS and I get an error that I do not understand:


  2012/06/25 15:35:38 [error] 16510#0: *34 FastCGI sent in stderr:
  "Access to the script '/opt/otrs/bin/fcgi-bin/index.pl' has been
  denied (see security.limit_extensions)" while reading response header
  from upstream, client: ..., server: support.....com, request: "GET
  /otrs/index.pl HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://127.0.0.1:9000", host:
  "support.....com", referrer: "http://support.....com/"


Why do I get this error? The otrs directory is writable for the webserver, so this is not the problem. Any ideas?

Assistant: I had a similar problem with index.html files which is how I got here from Google.  Among other problems, switching from spawn to php-fpm gave most of my domains "Access denied" errors.  I got the same "see security.limit_extensions" in my error.log.  The affected index.html files didn't have any PHP code either, but I assume NginX still tried to execute them through php-fpm, thus throwing the errors.  I'm using CentOS:


Edit /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
Uncomment this line, by default .htm and .html are blocked: 


security.limit_extensions = .php .php3 .php4 .php5 .html .htm


service php-fpm restart
