The provided examples contain some inconsistencies and could be clarified for better understanding. Here is a more coherent and professional version:

---

In the first example, the variable `i` is declared within each `for` loop, which creates a new scope for each `i`:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++);
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++);
```

In this case, the `let` keyword ensures that `i` is block-scoped, meaning each `for` loop has its own independent `i` variable.

However, in the second example, the variable `i` is referenced outside of the loops:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++);
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++);
i;
```

Here, the reference to `i` after the loops will result in a `ReferenceError` because `i` is not defined in the outer scope. The `let` keyword restricts the visibility of `i` to the `for` loop blocks, and it is not accessible outside of those blocks.

Therefore, the two snippets do not produce the same result. The first snippet runs without errors, while the second snippet throws a `ReferenceError` due to the attempt to access `i` outside of its block scope.

This revised version clearly explains the scoping behavior and the expected outcomes of the code snippets.
