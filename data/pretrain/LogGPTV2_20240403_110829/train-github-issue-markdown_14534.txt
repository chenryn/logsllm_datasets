### Superset Version
0.15

### Expected Results
The ability to export data directly from the dashboard page.

### Actual Results
Currently, to export data, one must click the "Explore" button, navigate to the slice, and then export the data from there. It would be more efficient to have the option to export data directly from the dashboard page, eliminating the need to navigate to the slice page.

### Question
Is it possible to implement a feature that allows for direct data export from the dashboard page? If so, how can this be achieved?

### Steps to Reproduce
Please provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue, including any relevant configurations or actions taken.
