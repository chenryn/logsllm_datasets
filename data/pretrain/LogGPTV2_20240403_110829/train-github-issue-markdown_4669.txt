 **Chris Beams** opened **SPR-5879** and commented
Some, but not all of the functionality available in
`AbstractTransactionalSpringContextTests` is currently available in the
TestContext framework.
Notably missing is support for `setComplete()`, `endTransaction()`, and
`startNewTransaction()` methods.
Since these methods ultimately manipulate thread-bound resources, it should be
possible to provide equivalent support through static methods on utility class
that ships as part of the TestContext support.
