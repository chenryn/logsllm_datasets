VII. APPLICATION TO LOCATION PRIVACY
Fig. 7. Area of San Francisco considered for the experiments. The input
locations correspond to the inner square, the output locations to the outer
one. The colored cells represent the distribution of the Gowalla checkins.
We show that F-BLEAU can be successfully applied to
estimate the degree of protection provided by mechanisms
such as those used in location privacy. Since the purpose
of this paper is to evaluate the precision of F-BLEAU, we
consider basic mechanisms for which the Bayes risk can also
be computed directly. Of course, the intended applications
of F-BLEAU are mechanisms or situations where the Bayes
risk cannot be computed directly, either because this is too
complicated, or because of the presence of unknown factors.
Examples abound; for instance, the availability of additional
information, like the presence of points of interest (e.g., shops,
churches), or geographical characteristics of the area (e.g.,
roads,
the Bayes risk in ways that are
impossible to evaluate formally.
lakes) can affect
We will consider the planar Laplacian and the planar geo-
metric, which are the typical mechanisms used to obtain geo-
indistinguishability [7], and one of the optimal mechanisms
proposed by Oya et al. [8] as a reﬁnement of the optimal mech-
anism by Shokri et al. [26]. The construction of the last relies
on an algorithm that was independently proposed by Blahut
and by Arimoto to solve the information theory problem of
achieving an optimal trade-off between the minimization of the
distortion rate and the the mutual information [27]. From now
on, we shall refer to this as the Blahut-Arimoto mechanism.
Note that the Laplacian is a continuous mechanism (i.e., its
outputs are on a continuous plane); the other two are discrete.
In these experiments we also deploy the method that F-
BLEAU uses in practice to compute the estimate of the Bayes
risk: we ﬁrst split the data into a training set and a hold-out
set; then, for an increasing number of examples n = 1, 2, ...
we train the classiﬁer on the ﬁrst n examples on the training
set, and then estimate its error on the hold-out set.
A. The Gowalla dataset
real
We consider
location data from the Gowalla
dataset [28], [29], which contains users’ checkins and their
geographical location. We use a squared area in San Francisco,
centered in the coordinates (37.755, -122.440), and extending
for 1.5 Km in each direction. This input area corresponds to
the inner (purple) square in Figure 7. We discretize the input
using a grid of 20 × 20 cells of size 150 × 150 Sq m; the
secret space S of the system thus consists of 400 locations. The
prior distribution on the secrets is derived from the Gowalla
checkins, and it is represented in Figure 7 by the different color
intensities on the input grid. The output area is represented in
Figure 7 by the outer (blue) square. It extends 1050 m (7 cells)
more than the input square on every side. We consider a larger
area for the output because the planar Laplacian and Geometric
naturally expand outside the input square.4 Since the planar
Laplacian is continuous, its output domain O is constituted by
all the points of the outer square. As for the planar Geometric
and the Blahut-Arimoto mechanisms, which are discrete, we
divide the output square in a grid of 340 × 340 cells of size
15 × 15 Sq m; therefore, |O| = 340 × 340 = 115, 600.
B. Defenses
The planar Geometric mechanism is characterized by a
channel matrix Cs,o, representing the conditional probability
of reporting the location o when the true location is s:
(cid:8)
(cid:7)
− ln ν
100
Cs,o = λ exp
d(s, o)
,
(25)
where ν is a parameter controlling the level of noise, λ is a
normalization factor, and d is the Euclidean distance.
The planar Laplacian is deﬁned by the same equation,
except that o belongs to a continuous domain, and the equation
deﬁnes a probability density function.
As for the Blahut-Arimoto, it is obtained as the result of an
iterative algorithm, whose deﬁnition can be found in [27].
4In fact these functions distribute the probability on the inﬁnite plane, but
on locations very distant from the origin the probability becomes negligible.

each graph is represented the distribution of the geometric noise for two adjacent input cells.
C. Results
We evaluated the estimates’ convergence as a function of
the number of training examples n and for different values of
the noise level: ν = {2, 4, 8}. We randomly split the dataset
(100K examples) into training (75%) and hold-out (25%) sets,
and then evaluated the convergence of the estimators on an
increasing number of training examples, 5, 6, ...75K.
Results for the geometric noise (Figure 8) indicate faster
convergence when ν is higher (which means less noise and
lower Bayes risk), in line with the results for the synthetic sys-
tems of the previous section. In all cases, the nearest neighbor
methods outperform the frequentist one, as we expected given
the presence of a large number of outputs. Table IX shows the
number of examples required to achieve δ-convergence from
the Bayes risk. The symbol “X” means we did not achieve a
certain level of approximation with 75K examples.
The corresponding results for the Laplacian noise are shown

in Figure 8 and in Table X. In this case,
approach is not applicable, but
approximate the Bayes risk for some approximation levels.
The case of the Blahut-Arimoto mechanism is quite dif-
ferent: surprisingly, the output probability concentrates on a
small number of locations. For instance, in the case ν = 2,
with 100K sampled pairs we obtained only 19 different output
locations (which reduced to 14 after we mapped them on the
20 × 20 grid). Thanks to the small number of actual outputs,
all the methods converge very fast. The results are shown in
Figure 10 and in Table XI.
VIII. COMPARISON WITH LEAKIEST
LeakWatch [5] and leakiEst [6] are the major existing black-
box leakage measurement tools, both based on the frequentist
approach. LeakWatch is an extension of leakiEst, which uses

the latter as a subroutine, but leakiEst is more feature rich: both
tools compute Shannon mutual information (MI) and min-
entropy leakage (ME) on the ﬁnite-output case, but leakiEst
can also perform tests in the continuous output case. We
compare leakiEst with our methods, for a time side channel
in the RFID chips of the European passports and for the
Gowalla examples of the previous section.
LeakiEst performs two functions: i) a statistical test, de-
tecting if there is evidence of leakage (here referred to as
leakage evidence test), and ii) the estimation of ME (discrete)
or MI (discrete and continuous output). The leakage evidence

test generates a “no leakage” distribution via a bootstrapping
variant, it estimates the leakage measure on it, and it compares
this estimate with the measure computed on the original
data: if its value is far from the former (w.r.t. some deﬁned
conﬁdence level), then the tool declares there is evidence of
leakage. The second function estimates the distribution with
an appropriate method (frequentist, for ﬁnite outputs, Kernel
Density Estimation, for continuous outputs).
A. Time side channel on e-Passports’ RFID chips
Chothia et al. [9] discovered a side-channel attack in the
way the protocols of various European countries’ passports
exchanged messages some years ago. (The protocols have been
corrected since then.) The problem was that, upon receiving
a message,
the e-Passport would ﬁrst check the Message
Authentication Code (MAC), and only afterwards verify the
nonce (so to assert the message was not replayed). Therefore,
an attacker who previously intercepted a valid message from
a legitimate session could replay the message and detect a

difference between the response time of the victim’s passport
and any other passport; this could be used to track the victim.
As an initial solution, Chothia et al. [6] proposed to add
padding to the response time, and they used leakiEst to look
for any evidence of leakage after such a defense.
We compared F-BLEAU and leakiEst on the padded timing
data [30]. The secret space contains answers to the binary
question: “is this the same passport?”; the dataset is balanced,
hence Rπ = 0.5. We make this comparison on the basis that,
if leakiEst detects no leakage, then the Bayes risk should be
maximum: no leakage happens if and only if R
= Rπ. We
compute ME from the Bayes risk as:
∗
ME := − log2(1 − Rπ) + log2(1 − R
∗
) .

For F-BLEAU, we randomly split the data into training
(75%) and hold-out sets, and then estimated R
on the latter;
we repeated this for 100 different random initialization seeds,
and averaged the estimates. Results in Table XII show two
cases where leakiEst did not ﬁnd enough evidence of leakage,
while F-BLEAU indicates non-negligible leakage. Note that,
because F-BLEAU’s results are based on an actual classiﬁer,
they implicitly demonstrate there exists an attack that succeeds
with accuracy 51% and 54%. We attribute this discrepancy
between the tools to the fact that the dataset is small (≈1K
examples), and leakiEst may not ﬁnd enough evidence to reject
the hypothesis of “no leakage”; indeed, leakiEst sets a fairly
high standard for this decision (95% conﬁdence interval).
