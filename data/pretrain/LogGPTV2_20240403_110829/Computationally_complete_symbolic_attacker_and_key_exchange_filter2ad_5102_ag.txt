RanGen(K) ∧ ˆφ, (cid:126)x  y ∧ dec(y, dK) (cid:54)= ⊥

∧ ∀xR(y = {x}R
This means the adversary cannot compute a y which decrypts
to something meaningful. This is exactly what we need from
the INT-CTXT property, namely, that the encryption cannot
be faked. Again, soundness of this axiom does not need INT-
CTXT encryption, it is immediate from our semantics.
• Encryptions with uncompromised keys do not compromise:
– For the IND case, we have
RanGen(K) ∧ RanGen(K
(cid:48)
) ∧ fresh(R; ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x, K, K
∧ (cid:126)x, x (cid:52) ˆφ ∧ ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{|x|}R
−→ ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x (cid:73)sic2 K
– For the KDM case, we have
RanGen(K) ∧ RanGen(K
(cid:48)
K(cid:48) (cid:73)ic K
(cid:48) ∨ ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)ic K
) ∧ fresh(R; ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x, K, K

)
∧ (cid:126)x, x (cid:52) ˆφ ∧ ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{|x|}R
−→ ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)skc2 K
K(cid:48) (cid:73)ic K
(cid:48) ∨ ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)ic K
Soundness of these follow from the compromise deﬁnitions.
• Fresh keys are not INT-CTXT compromised if encryption is
INT-CTXT secure:
– keyfresh(K; ˆφ) −→ ˆφ(cid:54)(cid:73)ic K. The intuition of this
axiom is that if the encryption is INT-CTXT secure and
if K is fresh, then the adversary cannot fake encryp-
tions with this key.
• Fresh items do not compromise: fresh(x; ˆφ, (cid:126)x, K) ∧ (cid:126)x (cid:52)
ˆφ ∧ ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x (cid:73)ic K −→ ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)ic K
8.2 Unforgeability
8.2.1 Semantics of Unforgeability
DEFINITION 8.2. We deﬁne INT-CTXT compromise as: We say
that Mc, Π, S, σ |s4= ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)ic K, if and only if Mc, Π, S, σ |s4=
(cid:126)x (cid:54)(cid:52) ˆφ ∨ ¬RanGen(K), or there is a PPT algorithm AOsic2, with
Mc,Π, S, σ ||= sdec(AOsic2
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x), K) (cid:54)= ⊥
9. ON CONGRUENCE OF EQUALITY
Note that the semantics of the equality predicate = is not de-
ﬁned as identity in the domain. In fact, on the left-hand sides of the
predicates Oand (cid:73)O, equal terms cannot be freely substituted. This
might cause problems with decidability, the result in [19] heavily
builds on the fact that  is invariant under substitution with re-
spect to equal terms. There is, however a solution if we observe
that CCA2 security implies that encryptions cannot be faked: for
CCA2 secure encryption schemes, we can deﬁne the semantics of
1241ˆφ, (cid:126)x Ox such that only those ciphers are not decrypted by the de-
cryption oracles that are necessary for the computation of [[ ˆφ, (cid:126)x]].
Here, when we say an encryption is necessary, we mean the encryp-
tion cannot be omitted and the number of encryptions reduced by
this in the process computing [[ ˆφ, (cid:126)x]]. The reason we did not deﬁne
our predicates this way is that we did not want the well-deﬁnedness
of our predicates depend on whether the encryption satisﬁes CCA2
security. But if the encryption does satisfy CCA2 security, then O
and (cid:73)Ocan be deﬁned in the above way and all axioms that we have
listed are also valid for those new deﬁnitions, and on the top of it,
= would be a congruence relation.
The symmetric Needham-Schroeder protocol proof as well as
the NSL proof work either way, and we believe this issue does not
make a big difference in protocol proofs in general. But for au-
tomation, the two deﬁnitions might make a big difference.
10. SOUNDNESS OF AXIOMS
THEOREM 10.1
(SOUNDNESS). With the computational in-
terpretations of derivability and key compromise predicates, the ax-
ioms are computationally sound. For the "fresh keys are not com-
promised", it is necessary that the implementation of the encryp-
tion satisﬁes the corresponding (symmetric or asymmetric, IND or
KDM-CCA2 security, or INT-CTXT unforgeability). Soundness of
the other axioms do not require that. Furthermore, the no-telepathy
axiom requires that freshly generated items are guessable only with
negligible probability.
Note, unlike for general soundness (Theorem 5.3), here the num-
ber of sessions in the computational execution does not have to be
bounded in the security parameter.
We detail the proofs in the IND case, the KDM case is sketched,
details will be included in the long version.
PROOF. As the soundness proofs of the axioms for derivability
with oracles are essentially the same as the soundness proofs below,
we skip that and focus on key compromise.
• Substitutability of equal terms: The reason is that according
to the deﬁnition of key compromise, compromise of the item
on the right hand side of (cid:73)Oonly depends on the bit string that
is associated to the term there, and not on the structure of the
term. This is in contrast with the left hand side. The notion
that anything can be submitted to the decryption oracle that
is not an encryption on the left clearly depends on the term
structure on the left, so we have to make sure that in (cid:126)x and (cid:126)y
the same encryption values occur.
• Derivability implies compromise: Soundness of this axiom
is rather trivial, but we write it out for clarity. In order to
show that in any protocol execution and n.n. set S, we have
Mc, Π, S |c= ∀(cid:126)xK( ˆφ, (cid:126)xOK −→ ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)OK), by the com-
putational semantics we have to show that for any evaluation
σ of the variables, and for any S(cid:48) ⊆ S non-negligible set,
Mc, Π, S(cid:48), σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x OK implies Mc, Π, S(cid:48), σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)O
K. So suppose Mc, Π, S(cid:48), σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x OK holds. To show
Mc, Π, S(cid:48), σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)O K, let us take any S(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊆ S(cid:48). By
Mc, Π, S(cid:48), σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x OK, there is a S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊆ S(cid:48)(cid:48) and an algo-
rithm BOO such that Mc, Π, S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), σ ||= BOO
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x) = K. In
the IND deﬁnition of key compromise, we can chose AOO
in the key compromise deﬁnition simply to be a random bit
string r(ω) of length η. AOO
can take the key and decrypt
its third input. AOO
can be chosen to be identically 0η. If
21
1
22
21
and AOO
the third input is the encryption of r(ω) then r(ω) is received
after the decryption, so the output of AOO
22 differ
overwhelmingly. On the other hand, if it is the encryption
0|r(ω)|, then the outputs of AOO
21 and AOO
22 always agree. So
by the deﬁnition of key compromise, Mc, Π, S(cid:48), σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)O
K holds as there is such an S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) for all S(cid:48)(cid:48).
• Increasing capabilities for key compromise: If ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)O K,
there are AOO
, R, etc in the deﬁnition of key compromise.
The same items are good for ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x(cid:48) (cid:73)OK, ignoring x(cid:48).
• Commutativity: Trivial, the deﬁnition of key compromise is
invariant under the change of the order of the list (cid:126)x.
• Transitivity: For any S, assuming Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x O
(cid:126)y and Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x, (cid:126)y (cid:73)O K, we have to show that
Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)O K. Take an arbitrary S(cid:48) ⊆ S. By
Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x O(cid:126)y, there is a S(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊆ S(cid:48) and an AOO
algorithm such that Mc, Π, S(cid:48)(cid:48), σ ||= AOO
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x) = (cid:126)y. By
Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x, (cid:126)y (cid:73)O K, there is a S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊆ S(cid:48)(cid:48) such that
for this S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), the conditions in the deﬁnition of key compro-
mise (in place of S(cid:48)(cid:48)) hold. Mc, Π, S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), σ ||= AOO
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x) =
(cid:126)y. So in the key compromise deﬁnition applied to the satis-
faction Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x, (cid:126)y (cid:73)O K, the algorithms AOO
,
AOO
can run AOO as a subroutine to compute
(cid:126)y, so they do not need it as an input. Since there is such a
S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊆ S(cid:48) for all S(cid:48) ⊆ S, we have Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:73)OK.
• Secrecy of CCA2 encryption: For the IND case, we have
and AOO

RanGen(K) ∧ fresh(R; ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x, y, K)
eK Oy
∧ (cid:126)x, x, y (cid:52) ˆφ ∧ ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R
−→ ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x (cid:73)OK ∨ ˆφ, (cid:126)x Oy
where O is either aic2 or sic2. Soundness of this follows
easily from our deﬁnition of key compromise and derivabil-
ity with oracle access. Note that CCA2 security of the en-
cryption is not needed in the following argument. We move
ˆφ, (cid:126)x Oy to the premise, it becomes ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:54)Oy. Let us denote
by θ the premise received this way. We have to show that for
any σ evaluation of free variables and S non-negligible set,
if Mc, Π, S, σ |c= θ, then Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x (cid:73)O K. So
suppose Mc, Π, S, σ |c= θ. For Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x (cid:73)OK,
take any non-negligible set S(cid:48) ⊆ S. As Mc, Π, S, σ |c= θ im-
plies that Mc, Π, S(cid:48), σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R
eK Oy by the semantics
of compound formulas (one conjunct in θ is ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R
eK O
y, and the property is preserved under taking subsets), for
such an S(cid:48), by the deﬁnition of derivability, there is a non-
negligible subset S(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊆ S(cid:48) and an algorithm AOO such that
Mc, Π, S(cid:48)(cid:48), σ ||= AOO
eK ) = y. Let BOO be
the algorithm that takes ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x as input, submits x to its
encryption oracle to receive {x}R(cid:48)
eK, and then applies AOO
on ( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R(cid:48)
eK ). As this was y with non-negligible prob-
ability for R, it is also y with non-negligible probability for
R(cid:48), because y does not depend on either of them, and be-
cause the random inputs of the algorithms are required to be
fresh. Hence R(cid:48) is just as good an independent item as R
was. So there is a S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) ⊆ S(cid:48)(cid:48) such that Mc, Π, S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), σ ||=
eK ) = y, and by the deﬁnition of BOO, we
AOO
also have Mc, Π, S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), σ ||= BOO
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x) = y. Therefore,
Mc, Π, S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), σ ||= AOO
eK ) = BOO
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x) =
y. Now observe, that since x was PPT generated, for any
non-negligible S, there must be a length function (cid:96)(η) such
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R(cid:48)
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R(cid:48)
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R
1242(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x),
eK ) (cid:54)= BOO
eK ) = BOO
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{0(cid:96)}R(cid:48)(cid:48)
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{0|x|}R(cid:48)(cid:48)
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{x}R
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x,{0
eK ) = BOO
|x|}R(cid:48)(cid:48)
, σ ||= AOO
, σ ||= AOO
(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)
that the probability that |x| = (cid:96)(η) is non-negligible on S.
This, means that AOO
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x) =
y cannot hold on any non-negligible subset of S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), because
if it did, then AOO
eK ) = y would also hold non-
negligible in S(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) contradicting Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x (cid:54)Oy. So,
Mc, Π, S
( ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x), but
Mc, Π, S
which means Mc, Π, S, σ |c= ˆφ, (cid:126)x, x (cid:73)OK.
The argument for the KDM case is completely analogous,
