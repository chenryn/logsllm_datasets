can read the sensor output. When the microcontroller “turns off”
the sensor, the switch disconnects the ADC from the sensor

output. When the ADC is disconnected from the sensor output,
in order to ensure that inputs to the ADC settle at a speciﬁc
level, the ADC should be connected to a reference voltage.
Note that the switch must be installed very close to the
sensor output. The wire between the switch and the ADC must
act as an unintentional antenna so that the security is the same
as powered passive sensors. Otherwise, if the wire between
the switch and the sensor output is long enough, this wire may
work as an unintentional antenna, which is also an injection
point. When the ADC is disconnected from the sensor output,
the readings of the ADC will not be affected by the attacking
signal. Since the zero samples will not be affected by the
attacking signal, no attack will be detected.
D. Difference between PyCRA and Our Approach
Shoukry et al. [26] proposed a generalizable sensor spooﬁng
detection method named PyCRA for sensors such as ultrasonic
sensors and infrared sensors, which consist of emitters and
receivers. As described in Section III, the emitter sends a
challenge signal to the measured entity, and the receiver gather
information from the reﬂected signal. In a spooﬁng attack, an
attacker manipulates the reﬂected signal. To detect such attacks,
PyCRA turns off the emitter randomly, and hence the receiver
should receive nothing during the shutdown of the emitter; if
a reﬂected signal is received when the emitter is off, an attack
is detected.
Our approach differs from PyCRA in the following as-
pects. In this paper, we show that our approach works
for powered/non-powered passive sensors. Because the
powered/non-powered passive sensors are the receivers of active
sensors, our approach also applies to the active sensors. Hence,
our approach is applicable to all three types of sensors that we
deﬁne in Section III. In PyCRA, since an emitter is necessary,
this method is designed for active sensors only. Thus, our
approach outperforms PyCRA as our approach covers two
more types of sensors.
PyCRA counts on the secrecy of the timing of voltage level
changes in the challenge signal. In PyCRA, for an attacker in
real life, there is a non-zero physical delay between capturing
the challenge signal and radiating an attacking signal. This
means that the attacker cannot align the attacking signal with
the reﬂected signal. Researchers [25] showed that PyCRA could
be entirely bypassed: suppose that the attacker has a faster
sampling rate than the sensor system, when the challenge signal
starts falling, the attacker can quickly spot the change and stop
generating attacking signals. Because the attacker does not
inﬂuence the periods that are used to detect attacks, she will
not be noticed by PyCRA. However, such an attacker cannot
bypass our detection method. In our scenario, the attacker has
full information of the timing as it is assumed in Section III-C.
In other words, our approach allows the attacker to precisely
align the attacking signal with the legitimate sensor output.
Even so, the attacker still must guess whether the sensor turns
on or off, and a wrong guess will expose the attacker herself
to the sensor system.
Regarding the threat model, in our approach, the attacker
can stay far away from the sensor system, as the attacker uses
EMI to remotely interfere with the sensor readings. In PyCRA,
the attacker must stay in a speciﬁc area near the sensor system
and the measured entity so that she can capture the challenge
signal and produce a malicious reﬂected signal. Therefore, our
approach has a stronger threat model.
For the working principle, our method detects attacks by
examining both non-zero and zero samples; however, PyCRA
monitors attacking signals by checking zero samples only. In
other words, PyCRA cannot recognize attacks affecting non-
zero samples.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Recent work on the defense methods against
the low-
power EMI attacks can be classiﬁed into three categories:
hardware methods, software methods, and hybrid methods.
The hardware methods use speciﬁc materials or electronic
components to mitigate attacking signals. There are several
common strategies such as shielding, differential comparators,
and ﬁlters. Regarding shielding, speciﬁc materials are used to
dampen the received electromagnetic radiation. Shielding is
recommended in previous studies [14], [16], [20]. Additionally,
we can use a differential comparator to remove the common
mode interference in the sensor signal and ground, and thus the
attacking signal can be mitigated. Also, a low-pass ﬁlter can
attenuate the signal outside the sensor’s baseband, and hence
the attacking signal at high-frequency band can be ﬁltered
out. However, researchers [13] presented that the parasitics in
surface mount components convert the low-pass ﬁlter into a
band-stop ﬁlter, which allows the attacking signal to pass. In
order to solve this problem, an alternative is using an EMI
ﬁlter. Although these methods effectively attenuate attacking
signals, they do not have the function of detection.
The software methods detect or attenuate the attacking
signal by examining the measurement at a software level. The
microcontroller knows the model of the measurement, and
anomalies found in the measurement may imply the existence
of an attacking signal.
A hybrid method is a combination of hardware methods
and software methods. In hybrid methods, microcontrollers
handle attacking signals through speciﬁc channels. Researchers
[16] proposed that a specialized component in the victim
device could be chosen to capture the attacking signal. The
captured attacking signal can be an input to an adaptive noise
canceling system (which can be realized in software), and
hence the victim system can attenuate the attacking signal in
the sensor signal. Also, they showed that the microcontroller
in a cardiac implantable electrical device (CIED) could use
its direct connection to the cardiac tissue to discern between
a measured signal and an induced signal. Fujimoto et al. [6]
proposed a detection method against the attacking signal in
the cryptographic integrated circuit by monitoring the built-
in voltage variation of the power supply using the on-chip
voltmeter. These hybrid methods are devised for speciﬁc
applications. In other words, they are not universal for different
devices. However, our approach is designed for sensor systems
that match our model, and it can be quickly deployed to the
sensor systems.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect EMI
attacks for sensor systems that match our model. In our
detection method, a sensor system turns off the sensor to
monitor the attacking signal in the sensor output. Our detection
method can prevent the sensor system from processing an
attacking signal: once the microcontroller detects an existence
of an attacking signal, the microcontroller rejects to handling
the sensor output further. Compared with other detection
methods, our approach is not only low-cost and space-saving
but also can be quickly deployed.
Regarding the security of the sensor system, we proved
that our detection method can be bypassed with a negligible
probability. The security of the sensor system is based on that
the n-bit secret sequence is unknown to the attacker. The longer
the secret sequence is, the more secure the sensor system is.
Also, our detection method can guarantee the security with a
small n.
In practice, we deploy the detection method to a microphone
system and a temperature sensor system. The high true-positive
rates show that our detection method is effective and robust in
detecting the attacking signal.
