### Summary of the System Log

This log chunk, spanning from 18:10:09 to 18:10:15 on October 18, highlights several key issues and actions within a Hadoop environment. The primary components involved are the `RMCommunicator Allocator` and the `LeaseRenewer`.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes were detected for both the `RMCommunicator Allocator` (port 8030) and the `LeaseRenewer` (port 9000). The old addresses included the IP `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170`, while the new addresses only include the hostname `msra-sa-41`.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` failed to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times, with the duration increasing from 312 to 315 seconds. The system indicated that it will retry shortly.

3. **Connection Retries**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempted to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030` multiple times. The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.
   - Each connection attempt resulted in an error (`ERROR IN CONTACTING RM`), and the system continued to retry the connection.

#### Detailed Breakdown:

- **Timestamp: 18:10:09**
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` and `LeaseRenewer`.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewal failure for `LeaseRenewer` (312 seconds).

- **Timestamp: 18:10:10**
  - **INFO**: Attempting to connect to `msra-sa-41:8030` (retry 0).
  - **ERROR**: Failed to contact RM.
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for `LeaseRenewer`.
  - **WARN**: Lease renewal failure for `LeaseRenewer` (313 seconds).

- **Timestamp: 18:10:11**
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for `RMCommunicator Allocator` and `LeaseRenewer`.

- **Timestamp: 18:10:15**
  - **WARN**: Address change detected for `LeaseRenewer`.

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing issues with address changes, lease renewals, and connecting to the Resource Manager (RM). The system is actively retrying connections and lease renewals, but these attempts are failing. Further investigation into the network configuration and the state of the RM may be necessary to resolve these issues.
