- **Disable Autorun if it is unnecessary.** [32]  
  If the Autorun feature is not essential for your operations, it should be disabled to prevent potential security risks.

- **Disallow or restrict removable media at an organizational policy level if it is not required for business operations.** [33]  
  If the use of removable media is not necessary for business operations, consider implementing a policy to disallow or restrict its use within the organization to enhance security.
