which the oﬀsets are chosen.
To explore the eﬃcacy of our technique we have run ex-
periments in two very diﬀerent networking environments.
The ﬁrst is a departmental LAN. The second consists of
hosts located at academic and research institutions through-
out the United States and Europe. Each scenario presents
its own set of diﬃculties. In the LAN, the ﬁxed delay dif-
ferences can be very small and RTTs are of the order of
hundreds of microseconds, so timing issues are important
and the decision-making component of the algorithm must
perform well. Cross-traﬃc in the LAN does not produce
such extreme delay variations as we observe in the Internet-
wide experiment.
In the Internet experiment, ﬁxed delay
diﬀerences are much larger, and RTTs of the order of tens
or hundreds of milliseconds, so timing and thresholds are
not so important. However, the delay variations are much
larger, inducing a larger noise eﬀect due to cross-traﬃc.
4.1 LAN Experiment
The ﬁrst set of experiments were run over a US Univer-
sity departmental LAN. For this experiment there were 16
receivers with IP addresses from two diﬀerent subnets. Both
subnets reside over the same physical network, which con-
sists of a single layer-3 router and multiple layer-2 ethernet
switches. Figure 7 depicts the logical network connectiv-
ity of the LAN. The router is a Cisco model 6509MSFC2
and switches are 3Com SuperStack models 3300 and 1000.
Note that some of the switches that interconnect hosts are
store-and-forward switches and others are cut-through. Our
technique resolves shared paths regardless of the switching
technology implemented at joining or branching points.
Each probe is 68 bytes, including payload, UDP, and IP

Figure 7: The true (and also discovered) logical
topology of the LAN network. The hollow inte-
rior circles represent switches or routers where the
paths from source C to diﬀerent receivers branch
apart. The ﬁlled circles indicate the nodes (the join-
ing points) where the paths to a given receiver from
sources A and C merge.
In this ﬁgure, they are
depicted as separate nodes, but our algorithm only
resolves the location of these nodes to a single logi-
cal link of the source-C topology. If a ﬁlled node is
positioned on a link in the source-C topology, then
the node must lie below the parent node of that link
but can either coincide with or lie above the child
node.
headers. We conservatively set spacing parameter ∆t to be
600 microseconds based on the assumption that the mini-
mum link bandwidth is 1Mbps. Using 600 microseconds for
the random oﬀset bound D is suﬃcient to encompass the
range of possible delays for the short paths of the LAN.
In our experiments on this topology, all of the decisions
(shared or unshared branching points) were correct in the
sense that they agreed with the known logical connectivity.
The decisions were made using the methodology for setting
thresholds described in Section 3.4. Figure 8 graphically
depicts the results of one experiment. We correctly identify
the set of shared paths. In this case, the results are suﬃcient
to completely resolve (to the logical link level) where the
paths from source A to the receivers join those from source
C.
4.2 Internet Experiment
In order to explore algorithm performance in an environ-
ment very diﬀerent from the LAN, we performed another
set of experiments using Internet hosts located in North
America and Europe. For these experiments there were 9 re-
ceiving hosts located at 5 diﬀerent academic establishments.
The two sources were both situated in North America. Fig-
ure 9 shows the logical connectivity between sources and
receivers, identiﬁed using the traceroute program.
The major network properties that aﬀect parameter se-
lection for our technique are minimum link bandwidth and
maximum end-to-end delay. Because these properties diﬀer
greatly between the LAN and Internet scenarios, software
parameters need to be adjusted accordingly. The same 68

Figure 8: Results of the LAN experiment. The x-
and y-axes correspond to receivers as labelled in Fig-
ure 7. The shade of gray of the square at position
(i, j) indicates the observed ratio of diﬀerent order-
ing events to total measurements for the receiver
pair (i, j). If the square at (i, j) is labelled with an
“s”, then the paths from the two sources to receivers
i and j share a common branching point in the true
topology. When the detection threshold is set to
1.00, the value determined by the procedure outlined
in Section 3.4, then all test decisions are correct.
byte UDP probes are used in either case. To account for a
potentially lower minimum link bandwidth we increase the
packet spacing parameter ∆t from 600 microseconds to 1
millisecond. Likewise, to adjust for the much larger range of
possible end-to-end delays the random oﬀset is drawn from
a uniform distribution spanning 90 milliseconds.
In this experiment we are able to correctly identify pairs
of receivers with shared paths from the two sources, but not
completely resolve entry points. Figure 10 shows the results.
In the Internet experiments, the set of results is insuﬃcient
to resolve the entry points of the paths from source A to a
single link. More receivers are required to produce a more
complete picture.
5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a technique for identifying shared paths
from multiple senders to a receiver using only end-to-end
measurements. This information can then be used to merge
two single-source tree topologies. The framework we pro-
pose revolves around a randomized probing scheme, with
receivers only recording packet arrival order. Without the
need for precise timing measurements, our scheme is very
practical to implement. Through Internet and LAN experi-
ments we have demonstrated the versatility and robustness
of the technique.
The experiments we report involve a relatively small num-
ber of receiver hosts. Admittedly, techniques using only end-
to-end measurements do not scale well to large numbers of
receivers. For a network consisting of M sources and N re-
ceivers, traceroute-based techniques require O(M N ) mea-
surements to be made (one for each source-receiver pair).

on the same campus, i.e. receiver pairs (1,2), (3,4),
(5,6) and (8,9). In this case the network topology
is not identiﬁable in the sense we deﬁned above. In
this experiment, we cannot completely resolve the
entry points of the paths from A, but we do correctly
identify shared branching points.

tradeoﬀ between relying on special purpose responses from
internal network elements and using end-to-end techniques
which require more measurements. However, in situations
where the network does not facilitate the use of traceroute-
based techniques, an algorithm using end-to-end measure-
ments to infer the logical topology may be better than noth-
ing at all. Additionally, while it may not be practical to
only make measurements to pairs of receivers at a time
for large numbers of receivers, we believe this work oﬀers
an important incite as to how algorithms based on end-to-
end measurements, such as our multiple source algorithm,
can potentially be used to ﬁll in where other measurement
methodologies leave oﬀ.
In future work, we will explore the development of mul-
tiple source probing methods aimed at characterizing net-
work topology and performance. We also plan to investi-
gate the extent to which measurements made from multiple
sources can be used to infer topology without knowledge of
any single-source tree topologies.
