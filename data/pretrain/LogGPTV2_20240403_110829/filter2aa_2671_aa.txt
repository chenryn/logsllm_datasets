Insecure Internal Storage in Android

It’s well known that in Android 
§  external storage is globally read/writable thus not secure; 
§  internal storage is isolated for each apps by sandbox thus 
is secure enough.  
§  By Google’s suggestion, applications store sensitive data and 
configurations here.

Today, we’re going to 
§  Present an attack to read/write data in internal storage 
§  by combination of disclosed attacks and vulnerabilities. 
§  Explain why 94.2% of popular apps are all vulnerable 
§  Disclose one category of apps storing password in 
plaintext 
§  which are under the attack above, 
§  affect billions of Android users, 
§  and may lead to enterprise or server account leaking. 
§  Discuss some ideas of mitigation.

Attacks 
ADB backup and restore 
§  Android Debug Bridge 
§  ADB backup 
§  Fully backup almost all apps’ internal data from device to PC. 
§  Password to encrypt backup archive is optional but not enforced. 
§  ADB restore 
§  Restore a backup archive to device. 
§  Can modify data in the archive before restore it. 
§  More details on archive format:

backups.html

Exceptions 
§  These apps won’t be backup or restored: 
§  whose “android:allowBackup” is false in AndroidManifest.xml 
§  who implemented a BackupAgent by themselves. 
§  When developers not set “android:allowBackup” 
manually, its value will be true	
  by default! 
§  How many apps can be backup? Will be discussed later.

It’s a known “attack surface” 
§  Used to root Android devices like 
§  some phone/tablet models (on XDA 
Developers) 
§  and even Google Glass 
§  But these methods are NOT 
designed for real attacks 
§  need user interactions 
§  only for rooting your own devices

Restrictions of abusing ADB backup/restore 
1.  Connect to target device through an USB cable.  
2.  The system supports ADB backup/restore. 
3.  ADB debugging is enabled. 
4.  The device’s screen is unlocked.  
5.  The PC can pass ADB authentication. 
6.  Click “Back up my data” button in ADB backup interface.   
Let’s “bypass” them all J

Connect to the device 
§  Bridge-way: use victim’s PC as a bridge/proxy 
§  Suppose attacker has controlled victim’s PC by malware or 
phishing and plans to attack remotely. 
§  Need to automate all further steps. 
§  Direct-way: directly attack victim’s Android device 
§  Suppose attacker can physically touch the target device 
temporarily. 
§  Thus allow his interactions with device in further steps. 
9  |  Claud Xiao. Insecure Internal Storage in Android. HITCON, 2014.08 
To find a bridge/proxy is not hard 
§  Cross infection between PC and mobile devices 
§  Mobile -> PC:USBCleaver, Ssucl, … 
§  PC -> Mobile: Zitmo, Droidpak, WinSpy/GimmeRat, … 
§  PC isn’t the only bridge 
§  May 2014, a customer bought a  
portable charger from Taobao,  
which was then found to be a  
customized remote control spy  
box with SIM card embedded. 
§  Just like a real version of Mactans 
presented in Black Hat 2013 
§  Or the “Juice-Jacking” attack

To physically touch a device is also not hard 
§  Intentionally (target someone) 
§  steal it  
§  temporarily borrow it 
§  or even buy it from victim’s family 
§  Unintentionally 
§  buy second-hand devices from resellers 
§  find a lost phone 
§  touch some public Android embedded devices

System’s support to ADB backup/restore 
§  Introduced in Android ICS 4.0. 
§  ~85.8% devices support it (Jul 7, 2014). 
§  Google announced there’re over 1 billion 30-day active users on 
the Android platform at Jun 2014.

Enable the ADB debugging 
§  Some enthusiasts have enabled it. 
§  Most of PC auxiliary tools ask and guide users to enable it. 
§  Some vendors even enable it by default. 
§  When using utilities like adbWireless, even a normal app 
can use ADB debugging locally 
§  Interesting. Apps may bypass sandbox in this way.

Enable the ADB debugging (cont.) 
§  For the rest devices, we can still try to enable it by an USB 
multiplexer 
§  in just tens of dollars for hardware cost

ADB authentication 
§  Introduced in Android 4.2.2 
§  For preventing unauthorized devices (e.g., PC, portable 
recharger) connect to Android in ADB mode. 
15  |  Claud Xiao. Insecure Internal Storage in Android. HITCON, 2014.08 
Bypass ADB authentication 
§  In all devices which support ADB, 45.7% don’t have ADB 
authentication thus not need to bypass. (till July 7, 2014) 
§  For the rest 54.3%, 
§  in “bridge-way”, we can suppose the victim’s PC passed 
authentication before. 
§  in “direct-way”, if device screen is unlocked, we can manually 
approve it. 
§  in “direct-way”, if device screen is locked, we can use a new 
disclosed vulnerabilities to bypass it. 
§  affect Android <= 4.4.2.

Unlock device’s screen lock 
§  Not all users use screen lock 
§  If it’s locked, since we can use ADB now: 
§  Disable it by CVE 2013-6271 
§  affect Android 4.0 - 4.3 
§  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Nov/204 
§  (Optional) use exists exploit to get root privilege, then disable it 
§  like CVE-2014-3153 or Android bug #12504045  
§  affect Android <= 4.4.4 (almost all Android devices) 
§  Notice: root exploit isn’t essential for the whole attack

Click confirmation button 
§  In “direct-way”, just manually 
click it. 
§  In “bridge-way”, can simulate 
user’s click by adb	
  shell	
sendkey to automate it in 
background:

Conclusions 
1. 
Highly possible to attack through USB cable via PC or touching 
device. 
2. 
85.8% of 1 billion devices support ADB backup. 
3. 
In plenty of devices, ADB debugging has been enabled, or can be 
enabled by special hardware. 
4. 
ADB authentication can be bypassed in almost all of them. 
5. 
Screen lock can be bypassed in most of them. 
6. 
User interaction can be performed automatically.

Impact 
If an app can be backup/restore 
§  attackers can read its internal sensitive data 
§  e.g., password, tokens, etc 
§  or modify these sensitive data or configurations 
§  e.g., login URL of banking 
§  Serious.

How many apps can be backup/restore? 
§  Analyzed 12,351 most popular apps from Google Play. 
§  556 of them explicitly set android:allowBackup to false. 
§  156 of the rest implement an BackupAgent to restrict backup. 
§  The rest 11,639 apps can be fully backup/restore.
