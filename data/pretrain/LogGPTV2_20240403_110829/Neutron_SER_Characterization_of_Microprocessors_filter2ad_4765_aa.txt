## Abstract
Hadrons generated by primary cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere can negatively impact the reliability of semiconductor devices. The electrical charge induced by high-energy particles manifests as a current spike, affecting both storage elements and combinational logic. The frequency of errors induced by this mechanism is referred to as the soft error rate (SER). As electronic devices shrink and supply voltages decrease, along with the increased complexity of VLSI circuits, SER has risen. This report discusses the impact of semiconductor technology scaling on neutron-induced SER. The experimental methodology and results of accelerated measurements conducted on Intel Itanium® microprocessors at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) are presented. Statistically significant values of mean time to failure (MTTF) due to high-energy neutrons are derived based on the number of upsets observed during the experiment. The approach described can be used as a benchmarking tool for both manufacturers and independent evaluators, without requiring proprietary data about the microprocessor.

## 1. Introduction
It has long been known that radiation negatively impacts the reliability of integrated circuits. In the late 1970s, several landmark papers highlighted that single event upsets (SEUs) in semiconductor memories were caused by cosmic ray flux and alpha particles from radioactive decay of packaging and interconnect materials. When high-energy particles penetrate silicon, they generate secondary particles that create electron-hole pairs, leading to a current spike. While no permanent damage typically occurs, data may be altered. The frequency of such errors is referred to as the soft error rate (SER).

Neutrons, protons, and pions are the main hadrons produced by primary cosmic rays. Their type and flux vary with altitude and geographical location. At sea level, neutrons are the primary hadrons affecting electronic circuits. Extensive research has been conducted to measure and estimate SER, using various methods including accelerated measurements with neutrons, protons, pions, and heavy ions. Models have been developed for SEU analysis, simulation of neutron-induced soft errors, and SER estimation at the system level.

The impact of SER on computing systems is becoming more significant due to the aggressive scaling of semiconductor manufacturing processes. Smaller transistor features and lower voltages have led to higher performance but also increased circuit sensitivity to particle-induced errors. The integration and complexity of VLSI circuits, particularly microprocessors, have led to a higher device count per unit area, making SER measurements crucial for ensuring dependability. This report presents the methodology and results of accelerated SER measurements on Intel Itanium® microprocessors at LANSCE.

## 2. Semiconductor Manufacturing Scaling Trends
According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), it is expected that the half-pitch of microprocessors (MPU) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) will drop to 21 nm by 2018. The physical gate length is expected to be as low as 7 nm and 9 nm for MPUs and ASICs, respectively. Supply voltages will decrease to 0.7 V for performance and 0.5 V for low-power circuits. This trend is expected to increase MPU performance to over 100,000 million instructions per second (MIPS) in a decade. However, higher integration and lower voltages have led to higher SER. Figure 1 shows the scaling trend for neutron-induced SER in static random access memory (SRAM). As the gate length shrinks, SER decreases at constant voltage but increases significantly with lower voltage. This is due to the lower critical charge needed to upset the circuit and the reduced cell capacity and supply voltage, increasing the likelihood of an upset. Future trends suggest that both transistor size and critical charge will continue to decrease, leading to higher SER/chip and an increased likelihood of multi-bit errors and soft errors in combinational logic.

## 3. Neutron SER Characterization
The main particles from atmospheric hadron cascades capable of inducing SEUs are neutrons, pions, and protons. At sea level, neutrons represent 94% of the hadrons, with pions and protons each accounting for 3%. At higher altitudes, such as 32,000 ft, pions and protons play a more significant role, but neutrons remain the principal component. Therefore, we focus on neutron SER characterization.

The LANSCE neutron beam was chosen for accelerated SER measurement because its energy spectrum closely matches that of cosmic-ray-induced neutrons. High-energy neutrons are produced through spallation, where a pulsed proton beam strikes a tungsten target, generating neutrons with energies up to 600 MeV. Figure 2 compares the LANSCE neutron energy spectrum with the cosmic-ray-induced spectrum at 40,000 ft, showing an acceleration factor of 10^6.

The system under evaluation at LANSCE consisted of an Itanium processor-based server. The server chassis was designed to expose only the processor to the neutron flux. To avoid booting interruptions due to neutron-induced failures, the server was moved out of the beam after each processor upset and then slid back in to resume measurements. The monitor and keyboard were located in a protected user area.

The fluence of neutrons striking the target was determined using a fission ion chamber, which counts fission-induced pulses. A method for calculating SER for semiconductor memories based on bit fail cross-section is provided in JEDEC JESD89. We expand this approach to complex integrated circuits, incorporating both memory cells and sequential and combinational logic. Equation (1) is used to derive the MTTF induced by high-energy neutron flux:

\[
\text{MTTF} = \frac{T_{ua}}{U} = \frac{(F_{cp} \times N_c) / N_f}{U}
\]

where:
- \(\text{MTTF}\) – mean time to failure due to neutron flux [h]
- \(T_{ua}\) – duration of an equivalent unaccelerated experiment [h]
- \(U\) – total number of upsets (failures) over the duration of the experiment
- \(F_{cp}\) – total number of fission chamber pulses over the experiment
- \(N_c\) – average neutron conversion factor [neutrons/fission pulse/cm²]
- \(N_f\) – cosmic-ray-induced neutron flux at the desired geographical location and altitude [neutrons/cm²/h]

The LANSCE measurement equipment provides \(F_{cp}\) and \(N_c\), representing the number of neutrons passing through one cm² of the integrated circuit. Division by \(N_f\) gives the duration of an equivalent unaccelerated experiment, and division by \(U\) yields the MTTF. By substituting the appropriate \(N_f\), MTTF can be determined for any geographical location.
