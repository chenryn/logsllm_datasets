Abstract
Hadrons generated by the primary cosmic rays
penetrating the atmosphere have a negative impact on
the reliability of semiconductor devices. The electrical
charge induced by high energy particles manifests as a
current spike and can affect both storage elements and
combinational logic. Frequency of occurrence of the
errors induced by this failure mechanism is referred to
as soft error rate (SER). Continuous shrinking of the
electronic devices and the lower supply voltages, in
conjunction with the increased complexity of VLSI
circuits, have led to higher SER. The impact of
semiconductor technology scaling on neutron induced
SER is discussed in this report. The experimental
methodology and results of accelerated measurements
carried out on Intel Itanium® microprocessors, at Los
Alamos Neutron Science Center
(LANSCE), are
presented. Statistically significant values of the MTTF
induced by high-energy neutrons are also derived, as a
function of the number of upsets observed over the
duration of the experiment. The presented approach

1. Introduction
It has been known for a significant period of time
that radiation has a negative impact on reliability of
integrated circuits. In late seventies several landmark
papers pointed out that single event upsets (SEU) were
induced in semiconductor memories by the cosmic ray
flux [12, 41] and alpha particles, generated during the
process of radioactive decay of the packaging and
interconnect materials [22]. Spallation reactions occur
when high energy particles penetrate the silicon. Some
of the secondary particles, generated in this process,
are highly ionizing and create electron-hole pairs, as
they cross the transistor junctions. The particle induced
charge manifests as a current spike. Usually no
permanent damage to the circuit occurs, although data
may get altered. The frequency of occurrence of the
errors induced by SEU is commonly referred to as soft
error rate (SER).
Neutrons, protons, and pions are the main hadrons
emerging from the particle cascades produced by the
primary cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere. The
type and the flux of the hadrons is a function of altitude
and geographical location. At the sea level neutrons are
the main hadrons impairing the proper operation of the
electronic circuitries. Extensive research has been
conducted over the last decades for measuring and
estimating SER of
For
instance, accelerated measurements, using neutrons,
protons, pions and heavy ions were presented in [10,
15, 42]. Several models were developed for device
SEU analysis [9, 26, 35], simulation of soft errors
induced by neutrons
[25, 36] and SER estimation at
the system level [18].
semiconductor devices.
The impact of SER on computing systems becomes
even more significant due to the aggressive scaling of
the semiconductor manufacturing processes. Lower
transistor features and lower voltages have led to
higher performance and, also, have increased circuit
sensitivity to particle induced errors. The impact of
SER of the combinational logic has also become a
concern [20, 32]. Last but not
the increased
integration and complexity of VLSI circuits, in general,
and microprocessors in particular, has been leading to a
continuously higher device count per unit of chip area.
As a result, SER measurements become paramount for
ensuring

for performance and 0.5V for low operating power
circuits (Table 1). As a result, it is expected that in a
decade microprocessor performance will increase to
over 100000 million instructions per second (MIPS).
However, higher semiconductor integration and lower
supply voltages have led to higher SER. Figure 1

manufacturing processes. The number of particles able
to induce errors, for a given die area, is expected to
saturate, SER being determined by the actual number
of strikes. After the saturation phase the SER/bit tends
to decrease. However,
the number of devices will
continue to increase, due to the higher complexity and
improved functionality of the integrated circuits. This
evolution will lead to higher SER/chip. Likelihood of
particle induced multi-bit errors will also increase, as
well as probability of soft errors within combinatorial
logic [32].

measure for technology level. One pitch is defined as the width of
the metal interconnect plus the width of the space between two

altitude frequently used by commercial aircraft,

neutrons remain the principal component of the hadron
cascades. Therefore we concentrate on neutron SER
characterization.
LANSCE neutron beam was chosen for accelerated
SER measurement as its energy spectrum is very
similar to the spectrum of cosmic-ray induced neutrons
[34, 39]. At LANSCE high-energy neutrons are
produced through spallation. A linear accelerator
generates a pulsed proton beam that strikes a tungsten
target. The impact produces neutrons with energies up
to 600 MeV. In Fig. 2 the LANSCE neutron energy
spectrum is compared with the spectrum induced by
cosmic rays, at 40,000 fit. In this figure the acceleration
factor is 106 (i.e. the natural cosmic-ray induced flux is
multiplied by 106).
The system under evaluation, at LANSCE, consisted
of an Itanium processor based server, placed in the
beam area. Mechanical design of the server chassis
allowed only the processor to be exposed to the neutron
flux. In order to avoid interruption of the booting
process, due to neutron induced failures, the server was
moved out of the beam after each processor upset, then
slid back in the beam, to resume the measurements.
The monitor and keyboard connected to the server
resided in the protected user area.

the neutrons striking the target
is
determined with the aid of a fission ion chamber,
located in the path of the beam. Neutrons passing
through the chamber initiate fissions, which create
voltage pulses. Monitoring equipment, located in the
user area, counts the fission induced
pulses and
determines the number of passing neutrons. A method
for calculating SER for semiconductor memories,
based on bit fail cross-section, is provided in JEDEC
JESD89 standard [17]. In this study we expand that
approach to the case of complex integrated circuits,
which incorporate both memory cells and sequential
and combinational
logic. Equation (1) is used for
deriving the MTTF induced by the high-energy neutron
flux:
MTTF = Tua/U = ((Fcp * Nc)/ Nf )/U
(1)
where
MTTF – mean time to failure due to neutron flux [h]
Tua – duration of an equivalent experiment, taking
place in unaccelerated conditions [h]
U – total number of upsets (failures) over the duration
of the experiment
Fcp – total number of fission chamber pulses, over the
duration of the experiment3
Nc – average neutron conversion factor [neutrons/
fission pulse/cm2]
Nf – cosmic-ray induced neutron flux at the desired
geographical location and altitude [neutrons/cm2/h]
Fcp and Nc,
in Equation (1), are provided by the
LANSCE measurement equipment, which performs the
fission pulse counting and integration over the energy
spectrum of the neutron flux. Their product represents
the number of neutrons which pass through one cm2 of
the integrated circuit, over
the
experiment. Division by Nf, on the right hand side of
Equation (1), provides the duration of an equivalent
unaccelerated experiment, and division by U gives
MTTF due to neutron flux. MTTF can be determined
at

substituting the appropriate Nf in Equation (1). A
