ABSTRACT
The “conversion rate” of spam — the probability that an unso-
licited e-mail will ultimately elicit a “sale” — underlies the entire
spam value proposition. However, our understanding of this critical
behavior is quite limited, and the literature lacks any quantitative
study concerning its true value. In this paper we present a method-
ology for measuring the conversion rate of spam. Using a parasitic
inﬁltration of an existing botnet’s infrastructure, we analyze two
spam campaigns: one designed to propagate a malware Trojan, the
other marketing on-line pharmaceuticals. For nearly a half billion
spam e-mails we identify the number that are successfully deliv-
ered, the number that pass through popular anti-spam ﬁlters, the
number that elicit user visits to the advertised sites, and the number
of “sales” and “infections” produced.

INTRODUCTION
Spam-based marketing is a curious beast. We all receive the ad-
vertisements — “Excellent hardness is easy!” — but few of us have
encountered a person who admits to following through on this of-
fer and making a purchase. And yet, the relentlessness by which
such spam continually clogs Internet inboxes, despite years of en-
ergetic deployment of anti-spam technology, provides undeniable
testament that spammers ﬁnd their campaigns proﬁtable. Someone
is clearly buying. But how many, how often, and how much?

Unraveling such questions is essential for understanding the eco-
nomic support for spam and hence where any structural weaknesses
may lie. Unfortunately, spammers do not ﬁle quarterly ﬁnancial
reports, and the underground nature of their activities makes third-
party data gathering a challenge at best. Absent an empirical foun-
dation, defenders are often left to speculate as to how successful
spam campaigns are and to what degree they are proﬁtable. For ex-
ample, IBM’s Joshua Corman was widely quoted as claiming that
spam sent by the Storm worm alone was generating “millions and
millions of dollars every day” [2]. While this claim could in fact be
true, we are unaware of any public data or methodology capable of
conﬁrming or refuting it.
The key problem is our limited visibility into the three basic pa-
rameters of the spam value proposition: the cost to send spam, off-
set by the “conversion rate” (probability that an e-mail sent will
ultimately yield a “sale”), and the marginal proﬁt per sale. The ﬁrst
and last of these are self-contained and can at least be estimated
based on the costs charged by third-party spam senders and through
the pricing and gross margins offered by various Internet market-
ing “afﬁliate programs”.1 However, the conversion rate depends
fundamentally on group actions — on what hundreds of millions
of Internet users do when confronted with a new piece of spam —
and is much harder to obtain. While a range of anecdotal numbers
exist, we are unaware of any well-documented measurement of the
spam conversion rate.2
In part, this problem is methodological. There are no apparent
methods for indirectly measuring spam conversion. Thus, the only
obvious way to extract this data is to build an e-commerce site,
market it via spam, and then record the number of sales. Moreover,
to capture the spammer’s experience with full ﬁdelity, such a study
must also mimic their use of illicit botnets for distributing e-mail
and proxying user responses. In effect, the best way to measure
spam is to be a spammer.
In this paper, we have effectively conducted this study, though
sidestepping the obvious legal and ethical problems associated with
sending spam.3 Critically, our study makes use of an existing spam-
1Our cursory investigations suggest that commissions on pharma-
ceutical afﬁliate programs tend to hover around 40-50%, while the
retail cost for spam delivery has been estimated at under $80 per
million [22].
2The best known among these anecdotal ﬁgures comes from the
Wall Street Journal’s 2003 investigation of Howard Carmack (a.k.a
the “Buffalo Spammer”), revealing that he obtained a 0.00036 con-
version rate on ten million messages marketing an herbal stimu-
lant [4].
3We conducted our study under the ethical criteria of ensuring neu-
tral actions so that users should never be worse off due to our ac-
ming botnet. By inﬁltrating its command and control infrastructure
parasitically, we convinced it to modify a subset of the spam it al-
ready sends, thereby directing any interested recipients to servers
under our control, rather than those belonging to the spammer. In
turn, our servers presented Web sites mimicking those actually
hosted by the spammer, but “defanged” to remove functionality
that would compromise the victim’s system or receive sensitive per-
sonal information such as name, address or credit card information.
Using this methodology, we have documented three spam cam-
paigns comprising over 469 million e-mails. We identiﬁed how
much of this spam is successfully delivered, how much is ﬁltered
by popular anti-spam solutions, and, most importantly, how many
users “click-through” to the site being advertised (response rate)
and how many of those progress to a “sale” or “infection” (conver-
sion rate).
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes the economic basis for spam and reviews prior research
in this area. Section 3 describes the Storm botnet, and Section 4
describes our experimental methodology using Storm. Section 5
describes our spam ﬁltering and conversion results, Section 6 an-
alyzes the effects of blacklisting on spam delivery, and Section 7
analyzes the possible inﬂuences on spam responses. We synthesize
our ﬁndings in Section 8 and conclude.
2. BACKGROUND
Direct marketing has a rich history, dating back to the 19th cen-
tury distribution of the ﬁrst mail-order catalogs. What makes direct
marketing so appealing is that one can directly measure its return
on investment. For example, the Direct Mail Association reports
that direct mail sales campaigns produce a response rate of 2.15
percent on average [5]. Meanwhile, rough estimates of direct mail
cost per mille (CPM) – the cost to address, produce and deliver
materials to a thousand targets – range between $250 and $1000.
Thus, following these estimates it might cost $250,000 to send out
a million solicitations, which might then produce 21,500 responses.
The cost of developing these prospects (roughly $12 each) can be
directly computed and, assuming each prospect completes a sale of
an average value, one can balance this revenue directly against the
marketing costs to determine the proﬁtability of the campaign. As
long as the product of the conversion rate and the marginal proﬁt
per sale exceeds the marginal delivery cost, the campaign is prof-
itable.
Given this underlying value proposition, it is not at all surpris-
ing that bulk direct e-mail marketing emerged very quickly after
e-mail itself. The marginal cost to send an e-mail is tiny and, thus,
an e-mail-based campaign can be proﬁtable even when the conver-
sion rate is negligible. Unfortunately, a perverse byproduct of this
dynamic is that sending as much spam as possible is likely to max-
imize proﬁt.
The resulting social nuisance begat a vibrant anti-spam commu-
nity, eventually producing a multi-billion dollar industry focused
on the same problem. However, with each anti-spam innovation
spammers adapted in kind and, while the resulting co-evolution has
not signiﬁcantly changed the spam problem, it has changed how
spam is purveyed. For example, the advent of real-time IP blacklist-
ing deployed in Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) forced spammers to
relay their messages through “untainted” third-party hosts — driv-
ing the creation of modern large-scale botnets. Similarly, content-
based anti-spam ﬁlters in turn forced spammers to create sophisti-
cated polymorphism engines, modifying each spam message to be
tivities, while strictly reducing harm for those situations in which
user property was at risk.
distinct. As well, it forced them to send even more spam. Thus,
it has been estimated that over 120 billion spam messages are now
sent each day [11].
However, while spam has long been understood to be an eco-
nomic problem, it is only recently that there has been signiﬁcant
effort in modeling spam economics and understanding the value
proposition from the spammer’s point of view. Rarely do spammers
talk about ﬁnancial aspects of their activities themselves, though
such accounts do exist [14, 21]. Judge et al. describe a prototypical
model of spam proﬁtability, including both the basic value propo-
sition as well as the impact of anti-spam ﬁltering and law enforce-
ment. They speculate that response rates as low as 0.000001 are
sufﬁcient to maintain proﬁtability [17]. Khong [13] likewise em-
ploys an economic cost model of spam, comparing the success of
several anti-spam strategies. Goodman and Rounthwaite construct
a more complex model, aimed at deriving the cost factors for send-
ing spam, and conclude depressingly that the optimal strategy for
sending spam is to send as fast as possible [9]. Serjantov and Clay-
ton explore these issues from the standpoint of an ISP and try to
understand how to place appropriate incentives around the use of
anti-spam blacklists [19].
However, the work that is most closely related to our own are
the several papers concerning “Stock Spam” [7, 8, 10]. Stock spam
refers to the practice of sending positive “touts” for a low-volume
security in order to manipulate its price and thereby proﬁt on an
existing position in the stock. What distinguishes stock spam is
that it is monetized through price manipulation and not via a sale.
