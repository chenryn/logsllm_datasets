## Abstract

The "conversion rate" of spam, defined as the probability that an unsolicited email will result in a sale, is a critical factor in the spam value proposition. However, our understanding of this metric is limited, and there is a lack of quantitative studies on its true value. This paper presents a methodology for measuring the conversion rate of spam. By infiltrating an existing botnet's infrastructure, we analyze two spam campaigns: one promoting a malware Trojan and the other marketing online pharmaceuticals. For nearly half a billion spam emails, we track the number successfully delivered, the number that pass through popular anti-spam filters, the number that elicit user visits to the advertised sites, and the number of resulting sales and infections.

## 1. Introduction

Spam-based marketing is a persistent and enigmatic phenomenon. We all receive these advertisements, such as "Excellent hardness is easy!" but few admit to making a purchase. Despite years of anti-spam technology, the relentless influx of spam suggests that spammers find their campaigns profitable. The key questions are: How many people buy, how often, and how much?

Understanding these metrics is crucial for grasping the economic underpinnings of spam and identifying potential weaknesses. Spammers do not provide financial reports, and the clandestine nature of their activities makes data collection challenging. Without empirical data, defenders can only speculate about the success and profitability of spam campaigns. For instance, IBM's Joshua Corman claimed that the Storm worm alone generated "millions and millions of dollars every day," but no public data or methodology exists to verify this claim.

The primary challenge lies in measuring the three key parameters of the spam value proposition: the cost to send spam, the conversion rate (the probability that an email will result in a sale), and the marginal profit per sale. While the first and last parameters can be estimated, the conversion rate, which depends on the actions of hundreds of millions of Internet users, is more elusive. Anecdotal numbers exist, but well-documented measurements are lacking.

To address this, we conducted a study using an existing botnet. By parasitically infiltrating its command and control infrastructure, we modified a subset of the spam it sends, directing interested recipients to servers under our control. These servers mimicked the actual spammer's websites but were "defanged" to prevent system compromise or the collection of sensitive personal information.

Our study documented three spam campaigns involving over 469 million emails. We analyzed the delivery success, filtering by anti-spam solutions, and, most importantly, the response and conversion rates.

## 2. Background

Direct marketing has a long history, with the first mail-order catalogs appearing in the 19th century. The appeal of direct marketing lies in its measurable return on investment. For example, the Direct Mail Association reports an average response rate of 2.15% for direct mail sales campaigns, with costs ranging from $250 to $1000 per thousand targets. Thus, sending a million solicitations might cost $250,000 and yield 21,500 responses, each costing approximately $12. If each prospect completes a sale, the revenue can be balanced against the marketing costs to determine the campaign's profitability.

Given this, it is unsurprising that bulk direct email marketing emerged soon after the advent of email. The low marginal cost of sending an email means that even a negligible conversion rate can make a campaign profitable. However, this dynamic also encourages spammers to send as much spam as possible to maximize profits.

The resulting social nuisance led to the development of a robust anti-spam community and a multi-billion dollar industry. Spammers have adapted to each new anti-spam innovation, leading to the creation of large-scale botnets and sophisticated polymorphism engines. It is estimated that over 120 billion spam messages are sent daily.

While spam has long been recognized as an economic problem, recent efforts have focused on modeling spam economics from the spammer's perspective. Studies by Judge et al., Khong, Goodman and Rounthwaite, and Serjantov and Clayton have explored various aspects of spam profitability and anti-spam strategies. Our work is closely related to studies on "Stock Spam," which involves manipulating stock prices rather than generating sales.
