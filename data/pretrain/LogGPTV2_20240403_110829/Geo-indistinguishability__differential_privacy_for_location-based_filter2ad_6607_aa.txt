ABSTRACT
The growing popularity of location-based systems, allowing un-
known/untrusted servers to easily collect huge amounts of informa-
tion regarding users’ location, has recently started raising serious
privacy concerns. In this paper we introduce geo-indistinguisha-
bility, a formal notion of privacy for location-based systems that
protects the user’s exact location, while allowing approximate in-
formation – typically needed to obtain a certain desired service – to
be released.
This privacy deﬁnition formalizes the intuitive notion of protect-
ing the user’s location within a radius r with a level of privacy that
depends on r, and corresponds to a generalized version of the well-
known concept of differential privacy. Furthermore, we present a
mechanism for achieving geo-indistinguishability by adding con-
trolled random noise to the user’s location.
We describe how to use our mechanism to enhance LBS appli-
cations with geo-indistinguishability guarantees without compro-
mising the quality of the application results. Finally, we compare
state-of-the-art mechanisms from the literature with ours. It turns
out that, among all mechanisms independent of the prior, our mech-
anism offers the best privacy guarantees.

record and process location data, generally referred to as “location-
based systems”. Such systems include (a) Location Based Services
(LBSs), in which a user obtains, typically in real-time, a service
related to his current location, and (b) location-data mining algo-
rithms, used to determine points of interest and trafﬁc patterns.
The use of LBSs, in particular, has been signiﬁcantly increased
by the growing popularity of mobile devices equipped with GPS
chips, in combination with the increasing availability of wireless
data connections. A resent study in the US shows that in 2012,
46% of the adult population of the country owns a smartphone and,
furthermore, that 74% of those owners use LBSs [1]. Examples
of LBSs include mapping applications (e.g., Google Maps), Points
of Interest (POI) retrieval (e.g., AroundMe), coupon/discount pro-
viders (e.g., GroupOn), GPS navigation (e.g., TomTom), and loca-
tion-aware social networks (e.g., Foursquare).
While location-based systems have demonstrated to provide enor-
mous beneﬁts to individuals and society, the growing exposure of
users’ location information raises important privacy issues. First of
all, location information itself may be considered as sensitive. Fur-
thermore, it can be easily linked to a variety of other information
that an individual usually wishes to protect: by collecting and pro-
cessing accurate location data on a regular basis, it is possible to
infer an individual’s home or work location, sexual preferences,
political views, religious inclinations, etc.
In its extreme form,
monitoring and control of an individual’s location has been even
described as a form of slavery [12].
Several notions of privacy for location-based systems have been
proposed in the literature.
In Section 2 we give an overview of
such notions, and we discuss their shortcomings in relation to our
motivating LBS application. Aiming at addressing these shortcom-
ings, we propose a formal privacy deﬁnition for LBSs, as well as
a randomized technique that allows a user to disclose enough loca-
tion information to obtain the desired service, while satisfying the
aforementioned privacy notion. Our proposal is based on a gen-
eralization of differential privacy [14] developed in [8]. Like dif-
ferential privacy, our notion and technique abstract from the side
information of the adversary, such as any prior probabilistic knowl-
edge about the user’s actual location.
As a running example, we consider a user located in Paris who
wishes to query an LBS provider for nearby restaurants in a private
way, i.e., by disclosing some approximate information z instead of
his exact location x. A crucial question is: what kind of privacy
guarantee can the user expect in this scenario? To formalize this
notion, we consider the level of privacy within a radius. We say
that the user enjoys (cid:96)-privacy within r if, any two locations at dis-
tance at most r produce observations with “similar” distributions,
where the “level of similarity” depends on (cid:96). The idea is that (cid:96) rep-

obvious: ﬁrst, the mechanism is designed once and for all (i.e. it
does not need to be recomputed every time the adversary changes, it
works also in simultaneous presence of different adversaries, etc.).
Second, and even more important, it is applicable also when we do
not know the prior.
Contribution.
This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art as follows:
• We show that our generalized notion of differential privacy
[8], instantiated with the Euclidean metric, can be naturally
applied to location privacy, and we discuss the privacy guar-
antees that this deﬁnition provides. (Location privacy was
only brieﬂy mentioned in [8] as a possible application.)
• We also extend it to location traces, using the d∞ metric, and
show how privacy degrades when traces become longer.
• We propose a mechanism to efﬁciently draw noise from a
planar Laplace distribution, which is not trivial. Laplacians
on general metric spaces were brieﬂy discussed in [8], but no
efﬁcient method to draw from them was given. Furthermore,
we cope with the crucial problems of discretization and trun-
cation, which have been shown to pose signiﬁcant threats to
mechanism implementations [29].
• We describe how to use our mechanism to enhance LBS ap-
plications with geo-indistinguishability guarantees.
• We compare our mechanism to a state-of-the-art mechanism
from the literature [36] as well as a simple cloaking mecha-
nism, obtaining favorable results.
Road Map.
In Section 2 we discuss notions of location privacy from the lit-
erature and point out their weaknesses and strengths. In Section 3
we formalize the notion of geo-indistinguishability in three equiva-
lent ways. We then proceed to describe a mechanism that provides
geo-indistinguishability in Section 4. In Section 5 we show how
to enhance LBS applications with geo-indistinguishability guaran-
tees. In Section 6 we compare the privacy guarantees of our meth-
ods with those of two other methods from the literature. Section 7
discusses related work and Section 8 concludes.
The interested reader can ﬁnd the proofs in the report version of
this paper [4], which is available online.
2. EXISTING NOTIONS OF PRIVACY
In this section, we examine various notions of location privacy
from the literature, as well as techniques to achieve them. We con-
sider the motivating example from the introduction, of a user in
Paris wishing to ﬁnd nearby restaurants with good reviews. To
achieve this goal, he uses a handheld device (e.g.. a smartphone)
to query a public LBS provider. However, the user expects his lo-
cation to be kept private: informally speaking, the information sent
to the provider should not allow him to accurately infer the user’s
location. Our goal is to provide a formal notion of privacy that ad-
equately captures the user’s expected privacy. From the point of
view of the employed mechanism, we require a technique that can
be performed in real-time by a handheld device, without the need
of any trusted anonymization party.
Figure 1: Geo-indistinguishability: privacy varying with r.
resents the user’s level of privacy for that radius: the smaller (cid:96) is,
the higher is the privacy.
In order to allow the LBS to provide a useful service, we require
that the (inverse of the) level of privacy (cid:96) depend on the radius r.
In particular, we require that it is proportional to r, which brings us
to our deﬁnition of geo-indistinguishability:
A mechanism satisﬁes -geo-indistinguishability iff for
any radius r > 0, the user enjoys r-privacy within r.
This deﬁnition implies that the user is protected within any radius
r, but with a level (cid:96) = r that increases with the distance. Within
a short radius, for instance r = 1 km, (cid:96) is small, guaranteeing that
the provider cannot infer the user’s location within, say, the 7th ar-
rondissement of Paris. Farther away from the user, for instance for
r = 1000 km, (cid:96) becomes large, allowing the LBS provider to infer
that with high probability the user is located in Paris instead of, say,
London. Figure 1 illustrates the idea of privacy levels decreasing
with the radius.
We develop a mechanism to achieve geo-indistinguishability by
perturbating the user’s location x. The inspiration comes from one
of the most popular approaches for differential privacy, namely the
Laplacian noise. We adopt a speciﬁc planar version of the Laplace
distribution, allowing to draw points in a geo-indistinguishable way;
moreover, we are able to do so efﬁciently, via a transformation to
polar coordinates. However, as standard (digital) applications re-
quire a ﬁnite representation of locations, it is necessary to add a
discretization step. Such operation jeopardizes the privacy guaran-
tees, for reasons similar to the rounding effects of ﬁnite-precision
operations [29]. We show how to preserve geo-indistinguishability,
at the price of a degradation of the privacy level, and how to adjust
the privacy parameters in order to obtain a desired level of privacy.
We then describe how to use our mechanism to enhance LBS ap-
plications with geo-indistinguishability guarantees. Our proposal
results in highly conﬁgurable LBS applications, both in terms of
privacy and accuracy (a notion of utility/quality-of-service for LBS
applications providing privacy via location perturbation techniques).
Enhanced LBS applications require extra bandwidth consumption
in order to provide both privacy and accuracy guarantees, thus we
study how the different conﬁgurations affect the bandwidth over-
head using the Google Places API [2] as reference to measure band-
width consumption. Our experiments showed that the bandwidth
overhead necessary to enhance LBS applications with very high
levels of privacy and accuracy is not-prohibitive and, in most cases,
negligible for modern applications.
Finally, we compare our mechanism with other ones in the litera-
ture, using the privacy metric proposed in [36]. It turns our that our
mechanism offers the best privacy guarantees, for the same utility,
among all those which do not depend on the prior knowledge of the
902Expected Distance Error.
Expectation of distance error [35, 36, 23] is a natural way to
quantify the privacy offered by a location-obfuscation mechanism.
Intuitively, it reﬂects the degree of accuracy by which an adversary
can guess the real location of the user by observing the obfuscated
location, and using the side-information available to him.
There are several works relying on this notion. In [23], a pertur-
bation mechanism is used to confuse the attacker by crossing paths
of individual users, rendering the task of tracking individual paths
challenging. In [36], an optimal location-obfuscation mechanism
(i.e., achieving maximum level of privacy for the user) is obtained
by solving a linear program in which the contraints are determined
by the quality of service and by the user’s proﬁle.
It is worth noting that this privacy notion and the obfuscation
mechanisms based on it are explicitly deﬁned in terms of the adver-
sary’s side information. In contrast, our notion of geo-indistingui-
shability abstracts from the attacker’s prior knowledge, and is there-
fore suitable for scenarios where the prior is unknown, or the same
mechanism must be used for multiple users. A detailed comparison
with the mechanism of [36] is provided in Section 6.
k-anonymity.
The notion of k-anonymity is the most widely used deﬁnition of
privacy for location-based systems in the literature. Many systems
in this category [21, 19, 30] aim at protecting the user’s identity,
requiring that the attacker cannot infer which user is executing the
query, among a set of k different users. Such systems are outside
the scope of our problem, since we are interested in protecting the
user’s location.
On the other hand, k-anonymity has also been used to protect
the user’s location (sometimes called l-diversity in this context),
requiring that it is indistinguishable among a set of k points (often
required to share some semantic property). One way to achieve
this is through the use of dummy locations [25, 33]. This technique
involves generating k − 1 properly selected dummy points, and
performing k queries to the service provider, using the real and
dummy locations. Another method for achieving k-anonymity is
through cloaking [6, 13, 38]. This involves creating a cloaking
region that includes k points sharing some property of interest, and
then querying the service provider for this cloaking region.
Even when side knowledge does not explicitly appear in the def-
inition of k-anonymity, a system cannot be proven to satisfy this
notion unless assumptions are made about the attacker’s side infor-
mation. For example, dummy locations are only useful if they look
equally likely to be the real location from the point of view of the
attacker. Any side information that allows to rule out any of those
points, as having low probability of being the real location, would
immediately violate the deﬁnition.
Counter-measures are often employed to avoid this issue: for
instance, [25] takes into account concepts such as ubiquity, con-
gestion and uniformity for generating dummy points, in an effort
to make them look realistic. Similarly, [38] takes into account
the user’s side information to construct a cloaking region. Such
counter-measures have their own drawbacks: ﬁrst, they compli-
cate the employed techniques, also requiring additional data to be
