of controls in our work focused on the individual stake-
holders. First and foremost, and in accordance with our
institution’s human subjects review process, we protect
customer conﬁdentiality since, of all parties described in
the data, they are most vulnerable. To this end, we com-
mitted to modify the raw data sets to anonymize person-
ally identiﬁable customer data such as their name, ad-
dress and the PAN component of their credit card in-
formation (though in a way that we are able to asso-
ciate multiple orders from the same customer). For the
remaining stakeholders, program employees, afﬁliates,
suppliers and payment processors, we use a similar stan-
dard in publishing our work. In each of these cases the
persons or organizations operate using handles or code
names that are not clearly identiﬁable (e.g., “brainstorm”
or “gl”) without the use of additional data sources. In
some cases (e.g., payment processors, suppliers) we have
become aware of the likely true names of these orga-
nizations (typically through reading the metadata) but
we restrict ourselves to using these non-identiﬁable code
names since the true names do not enhance our analysis.
We do not name program employees and we typically
discuss afﬁliates in aggregate, with an exception being
the top afﬁliates whom we distinguish in this paper using
only their online handles.
4 Derived Data
Using “found data” also introduces a range of method-
ological challenges, ranging from reverse engineering
schemas to resolving ambiguities in the data. In this sec-
tion we describe the data sets (summarized in Table 1)
and explain how we derived the additional contextual re-
lations used in our analysis.
4.1 GlavMed and SpamIt
The ﬁrst two data sets are PostgresSQL database dumps
of the operational databases for the GlavMed and SpamIt
programs, including all schemas, data, and trigger func-
tions, but no other code external to the database. The
GlavMed database begins November 2005 and ends
early May 2010, of which we use the period spanning
all of 2007–2009 and the ﬁrst four months of 2010.2
2Since our goal is accuracy and not completeness, we purposely ex-
clude the ﬁrst 14 months of the data set because it is both “poisoned”
4
GlavMed and SpamIt are sister programs run by the same
organization and, indeed, both use the same database
schema. In fact, it appears that SpamIt was “forked”
from the GlavMed database on June 19, 2007: all records
before that date are identical in both databases, while
records after that date are distinct. Leaked chat logs
of the program operators suggest that this split was
related to the owner’s contemporaneous acquisition of
Spamdot.biz, a popular closed spammer forum of that
period. In part through this forum, the SpamIt program
nominally catered to a select group of afﬁliates relying on
email and other forms of spam, while GlavMed remained
open to a broader range of advertisers who primarily ad-
vertised via search engine optimization techniques.3
A detailed description of the data and its associated
schema, consisting of over 140 tables in each database,
is outside the scope of this paper. However, we perform
most of our analysis using ﬁve tables: shop sales de-
scribing each order, shop transactions recording at-
tempts to bill (or refund) the order via a payment service
provider, shop customers recording customer infor-
mation, shop affiliates recording information about
each afﬁliate, and shop affiliates income 2 record-
ing afﬁliate commissions for each sale. We also relied on
instant message chat logs of the operators of GlavMed
and SpamIt to aid our understanding and validate our hy-
potheses about the meaning and use of various tables.
However, the GlavMed and SpamIt databases are fun-
damentally operational in nature, and not naturally de-
signed for the kind of broad analysis that are the goal
of this paper. Thus, we now describe the additional data
processing required to produce necessary relations (e.g.,
such as identifying unique customers).
4.1.1 Customers
In an ideal world, each customer record would represent
a unique customer and include accurate demographic in-
formation for our analysis (age, sex, and either country
or U.S. ZIP code). The reality, hardly unique to our data
set, is less obliging: In addition to many test accounts
with transactions for other kinds of products, including $500K in
counterfeit software sales, and makes inconsistent use of the database
schemas that become standard in the later portion of the date range.
3This distinction is not absolute, however; domains advertised by
GlavMed afﬁliates have appeared in email spam.
used by the store operators, a large number of customer
records are generated by irate users venting their frustra-
tion with the deluge of spam advertising the program.4
Thus, for the purpose of this study, we consider only
customers who have successfully placed an order (more
speciﬁcally, those whose credit card or other payment
mechanism was successfully billed, as described later),
which reduces the number of customer records by 21%
in the GlavMed data set (from 875,457 to 690,590) and
39% in the SpamIt data set (from 1,145,521 to 693,319),
the latter clearly attracting more abuse.
De-duplication. An additional problem is that, unless
the customer uses a previously assigned customer num-
ber to explicitly log in, each repeat order would result in
a new customer record. To identify repeat customers, we
de-duplicate the remaining customer records by coalesc-
ing those whose name, billing address and email address
are identical, reducing the number of unique customers
to 584,199 in GlavMed and 535,365 in SpamIt. For ad-
dress matching, we used the common Visa/MasterCard
Address Veriﬁcation System (AVS) predicate, which re-
lies on street number and ZIP code only. Both names and
email address matches were case insensitive, and we al-
lowed ﬁrst and last names to be transposed.
Demographics. Our analysis relies on customer demo-
graphic data consisting of the customer’s country or U.S.
ZIP code, as well as their self-reported age and sex. The
country and ZIP code are necessary for proper order ful-
ﬁllment, and therefore are generally reliable. However,
customers optionally provide age and sex data when or-
dering, so it is not always present and it is subject to
misreporting. Only 41% of GlavMed orders and 38% of
SpamIt orders included this information, and we cannot
validate it since customers could easily dissemble. In-
deed, we found that a larger than expected number of
users reported birth dates of January 1, February 2, and
so on (these being some of the easiest dates to report via
the interface). However, these anomalies are a small mi-
nority and we proceed under the assumption that the data
is generally correct (eliminating these cases does not sub-
stantively change the results reported in Section 5.1.3).
4.1.2 Afﬁliates
As with customers, afﬁliate records also require de-
duplication. However, here the duplication is not a mere
artifact of the interface, but is frequently an intentional
action. Afﬁliates frequently register under multiple iden-
tities, either to modulate their perceived earnings (afﬁli-
ate programs commonly provide “top” lists showing the
afﬁliates with the highest earned commissions) or to gain
4This frustration was well captured by the many regular expres-
sions in the operators’ customer blacklist, e.g., (.*)SP(A+)M(.*) and
(.*)F(U+)CK(.*).

access to additional referral commissions that are pro-
vided on sales generated by new afﬁliates referred into
the program.5 To address these issues, we de-duplicate
afﬁliates as follows. For all afﬁliates with over $200 in
revenue we link those who share an email address, ICQ
number6 or “identiﬁed commission payments”. We con-
sidered a commission payment to be identiﬁed if it rep-
resents over 75% of an afﬁliate’s revenue and includes
unique payment account information (such as a Web-
Money, Fethard Finance, or ePassporte account or an
identiﬁed GlavMed payment card). The notion of identi-
ﬁed payments was necessary to avoid incorrectly associ-
ating afﬁliates who use the commission payments system
to pay third parties (e.g., by asking for small payouts to
a third-party WebMoney purse).
4.1.3 Transaction Outcomes
In the GlavMed and SpamIt data sets, each customer
sales record in turn drives the creation of one or more
transaction records which reﬂect an attempt to transfer
money to or from a customer (as identiﬁed by a credit
card or Automated Clearing House (ACH) identiﬁer) via
a third-party payment service provider. When a trans-
action is successful the response status ﬁeld in this
record is zero (we validated these semantics by exam-
ining both raw payment processing error messages and
associated SQL triggers in the databases).
However, for a host of reasons transactions are fre-
quently declined. Indeed, over 25% of all transaction at-
tempts decline in both the GlavMed and SpamIt data sets.
In these cases, new transactions may be generated, pos-
sibly using different payment service providers. In some
cases, large order amounts are billed into two smaller
transactions. Overall, 91% of sales are able to complete
a payment transaction.
Finally, a transaction may be refunded, either par-
tially or fully. An additional complexity arises from cur-
rency conversion because customer payments are inter-
nally valued in U.S. Dollars, but can arrive in Euros,
Pounds and several other currencies. When refunds ar-
rive in native currency, we locate the original transaction
and calculate the dollar refund value on a pro-rated ba-
sis against the original value in the native currency. All
revenue numbers reported in the analysis refer to the total
amount billed, before any refunds against the transaction.
Refunds are shown separately in Table 3.
Note that having this ground truth data allows us to
calibrate biases in previous methods for estimating rev-
enue. In particular, we revisit our “purchase pair” tech-
5As an incentive to attract afﬁliates, program sponsors will typically
offer their afﬁliates a 5% commission on the future sales of any new
afﬁliate they bring into the program.

very popular in Russia and CIS states.
nique that infers order turnover via customer order num-
ber advancement and then conservatively estimates the
average order size to gauge overall revenue [9]. Across
four years, we ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant number of order
numbers never appear in the database due to either ﬁl-
tering for customer fraud or shopping cart abandonment
(between 13–28% for SpamIt and 7–17% for GlavMed).
The lower number of absent orders for GlavMed is likely
because the search engine vector used by its afﬁliates
generates less antipathy among consumers. In both cases,
8–12% of the orders that do appear in the database are
ultimately declined and do not ship. Consequently, true
turnover is between 8% (low of GlavMed) and 35% (high
of SpamIt) less than predicted by the “purchase pair”
technique. However, since the average successful order
size is between $115 (GlavMed) and $135 (SpamIt),
revenue estimates basd on an average sale of $100 are
roughly in-line with true revenue (within 6% overall for
GlavMed and 13% overall for SpamIt).
4.2 RX-Promotion
Our third data set concerning transactions from the
RX-Promotion program is far more limited. It only cov-
ers a single year of data from January to December of
2010, consisting of a single extracted view summarizing
each sale during the period made by U.S. customers. In
addition, roughly one week of data is missing (around
the last week of April 2010). Consequently, this trans-
actional data will strictly understate the turnover from
RX-Promotion.7
Each sales record includes information about the cus-
tomer (name only), the status of the order, its contents,
the total price as well the amount paid to the supplier,
shipper and the afﬁliate who generated the sale. Our anal-
ysis includes only orders with the status value “shipped”,
which make up 77% of all sales records (“declined” was
the next largest category at 14%).
Since the RX-Promotion data set does not include
crisp customer identiﬁers, we use two approximations for
identifying multiple orders belonging to the same cus-
tomer. The conservative approximation of 69,446 cus-
tomers only links sales records together if a customer
explicitly logs into the site using a previously assigned
customer ID. However, we note that this measure strictly
overestimates the number of customers since many users
prefer to place subsequent orders by entering in their in-
formation again. Alternatively, one can group customers
that share the same ﬁrst and last name (normalized for
7Based on our measurements of both the GlavMed and SpamIt data
sets, our own previous study of the Eva Pharmacy program [9], and in-
ference from the RX-Promotion metadata, we are conﬁdent that U.S.
customers represent between 75% and 85% of total turnover. In ad-
dition, the missing week of data from April should cause our data to
underestimate annual orders by an additional 2%.

capitalization), resulting in 59,769 customers. This ap-
proach will accurately capture multiple orders from the
same user, but at the expense of potentially aliasing users
who happen to share the same ﬁrst and last names. Thus,
the true number of unique customers is likely between
the two estimates, but to avoid aliasing issues we use the
larger conservative estimate in our analyses.
Finally, we also make use of seven months of over-
lapping metadata that includes detailed spreadsheets ac-
counting for month-by-month costs and cash ﬂow. This
data does not have any of the previous limitations and
captures the ﬁnancial performance of the program pre-
cisely and in its entirety.
5 Analysis
Using these data sets, we now provide a detailed assess-
ment of the afﬁliate program business model. From the
standpoint of the program sponsor, we consider four key
aspects of the business enterprise in turn: customers, af-
ﬁliate advertisers, costs and payment processing.
5.1 Customers
Neither online pharmacies nor their advertisers generate
capital on their own. These activities thrive only because
they exploit latent customer demand for the products on
offer. It is this customer purchasing that drives the entire
ecosystem and thus this is where we begin: how many
purchases, for what, by whom and, perhaps, why?
Overall, as shown in Table 1, 584,199 unique cus-
tomers placed orders via GlavMed during the measure-
ment period and 535,365 placed orders via SpamIt; of
these approximately 130K appear in both. RX-Promotion
is a smaller program and covers a shorter time period,
with somewhere between 59,769 and 69,446 distinct cus-
tomers placing orders. In turn these customers gener-
ated almost 1.5M orders, varying from week to week as
shown in Figure 1. Note that the spike in May 2007 for
GlavMed is an artifact corresponding to the short period
after GlavMed had purchased SpamIt, but before they

New customers, however, are not the whole story. The
graphs in Figure 3 show total program revenue per week
broken down into two components: revenues from ﬁrst-
time customers and revenue from repeat orders from ex-
isting customers. What we see is that repeat orders are an
important part of the business, constituting 27% and 38%
of average program revenue for GlavMed and SpamIt,
respectively. For RX-Promotion revenue from repeat or-
ders is between 9% and 23% of overall revenue.
Overall, revenue from repeat customers steadily in-
creases over the years for GlavMed and SpamIt, and
holds steady even when orders and overall revenue de-
cline in mid-2009. The situation is more dynamic for
RX-Promotion with a pronounced dip in program rev-
enue in the middle of 2010 that impacts new and repeat
customers both. This dip corresponds to the period when
RX-Promotion lost its payment processing services for
scheduled drugs.9 Indeed, if we only consider the period
after August 2nd, repeat order revenue averages between
12% and 32%.
This data highlights a counterpoint to the conventional
wisdom that online pharmacies are pure scams: simply
taking credit cards and either never providing goods or
providing goods of no quality. Were this hypothesis true,
we would not expect to see repeat purchases—clear signs
of customer satisfaction—in such numbers. Anecdotally,
we have placed several hundred such orders ourselves
