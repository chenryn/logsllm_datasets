In Visual Studio (full version), I tend to turn off the Ctrl+LeftMouseClick go
to definition feature. I personally prefer to have Ctrl+LeftMouseClick select
the entire word under my mouse cursor.
From what I can see, mouse events are not configurable at the moment, and they
are also not possible to override with extensions (to the best of my
knowledge). It would be really nice to have a mouse mapping configuration
file. Sublime Text has this (although it is sort of a hidden feature that is
not exposed through the UI). Just as an example, my sublime text mousemap file
looks like this:
    [
        {
            "button": "button1", "count": 1, "modifiers": ["ctrl"],
            "press_command": "drag_select",
            "press_args": {"by": "words"}
        }
    ]
