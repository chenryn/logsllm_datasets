**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Gamaredon Group

The Gamaredon Group has employed various tactics to deliver malicious payloads. One of their methods involves using DOCX files to download malicious DOT document templates. Additionally, they have utilized RTF template injection to download and execute malicious payloads.[5] The group is also known for injecting malicious macros or remote templates into documents that are already present on compromised systems.[16][17][18][19][20][21]

This approach allows the Gamaredon Group to leverage existing documents on a victim's system, making their attacks more stealthy and effective.
