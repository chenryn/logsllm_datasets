User: I've just completed the very very nice django tutorial and it all went swimmingly. One of the first parts of the tutorial is that it says not to use their example server thingie in production, my first act after the tutorial was thus to try to run my app on apache.
I'm running OSX 10.5 and have the standard apache (which refuses to run python) and MAMP (which begrudgingly allows it in cgi-bin). The problem is that I've no idea which script to call, in the tutorial it was always localhost:8000/polls but I've no idea how that's meant to map to a specific file.
Have I missed something blatantly obvious about what to do with a .htaccess file or does the tutorial not actually explain how to use it somewhere else?
Assistant: Unless you are planning on going to production with OS X you might not want to bother. If you must do it, go straight to mod_wsgi. Don't bother with mod_python or older solutions. I did mod_python on Apache and while it runs great now, it took countless hours to set up.
Also, just to clarify something based on what you said: You're not going to find a mapping between the url path (like /polls) and a script that is being called. Django doesn't work like that. With Django your application is loaded into memory waiting for requests. Once a request comes in it gets dispatched through the url map that you created in urls.py. That boils down to a function call somewhere in your code.
That's why for a webserver like Apache you need a module like mod_wsgi, which gives your app a spot in memory in which to live. Compare that with something like CGI where the webserver executes a specific script on demand at a location that is physically mapped between the url and the filesystem.
I hope that's helpful and not telling you something you already knew. :)
