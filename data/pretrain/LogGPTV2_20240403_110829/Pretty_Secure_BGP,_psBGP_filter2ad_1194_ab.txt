trol messages include, for example, modiﬁcation, inser-
tion, deletion, exposure, and replaying of messages. In
this paper, we focus on modiﬁcation and insertion (here-
after falsiﬁcation [4]) of BGP control messages; dele-
tion, exposure and replaying are beyond the scope of
this paper. Deletion appears indistinguishable from le-
gitimate route ﬁltering. Exposure might compromise
conﬁdentiality of BGP control messages, which may or
may not be a major concern [4]. Replaying is a serious
threat, which can be handled by setting expiration time
for a message; however it seems challenging to ﬁnd an
appropriate value for an expiration time.
There are four types of BGP control messages:
OPEN, KEEPALIVE, NOTIFICATION, and UPDATE.
The ﬁrst three are used for establishing and maintaining
BGP sessions with peers, and falsiﬁcation of them will
very likely result in session disruption. As mentioned by
Hu et al. [20], they can be protected by a point-to-point
authentication protocol, e.g., IPsec [21]. We concentrate
on falsiﬁcation of BGP UPDATE messages (hereafter,
we refrain from capitalizing update as UPDATE) which
carry inter-domain routing information and are used for
building up routing tables.
A BGP update message consists of three parts:
withdrawn routes, network layer reachability informa-
tion (NLRI), and path attributes (e.g., AS PATH, LO-
CAL PREF, etc.). A route should only be withdrawn by
a party which had previously announced that route. Oth-
erwise, a malicious entity could cause service disruption
by withdrawing a route which is actually in service. Dig-
itally signing BGP update messages will allow to verify
if a party has the right to withdraw a route. Further dis-
cussion is beyond the scope of the present paper.
NLRI consists of a set of IP preﬁxes sharing the same
characteristics as described by the path attributes. NLRI
is falsiﬁed if an AS originates a preﬁx not owned by that
AS, or aggregated improperly from other routes. Exam-
ples of consequences include denial of service and man-
in-the-middle attacks. There are two types of AS PATH:
AS SEQUENCE or AS SET. An AS PATH of type
AS SEQUENCE consists of an ordered list of ASes tra-
versed by this route. An AS PATH of type AS SET con-
sists of an unordered list of ASes, sometimes created
when multiple routes are aggregated. Due to space lim-
itations, we focus on the security of AS SEQUENCE.
(Note: AS SET is less widely used on the Internet. For
example, as of August 1, 2004, only 23 of 17 884 ASes
originated 47 of 161 796 preﬁxes with AS SET.) An
AS PATH is falsiﬁed if an AS or any other entity ille-
gally operates on an AS PATH, e.g., inserting a wrong
AS number, deleting or modifying an AS number on the
path, etc. Since AS PATH is used for detecting rout-
ing loops and used by route selection processes, fal-
siﬁcation of AS PATH can result in routing loops or
selecting routes not selected otherwise. We are inter-
ested in countering falsiﬁcation of NLRI and AS PATH.
We assume there are multiple non-colluding misbehav-
ing ASes and BGP speakers in the network, which may
have legitimate cryptographic keying materials. This
non-colluding assumption is also made by S-BGP and
soBGP, explicitly or implicitly.
2.4. BGP Security Goals
We seek to design secure protocol extensions to BGP
which can resist the threats as discussed above. As with
most other secure communication protocols, BGP secu-
rity goals must include data origin authentication and
data integrity. In addition, veriﬁcation of the propriety
of BGP messages is required to resist falsiﬁcation at-
tacks. Speciﬁcally, the propriety of NLRI and AS PATH
should be veriﬁed. All veriﬁcation will be performed
most likely by a BGP speaker online, but possibly by an
operator ofﬂine . We summarize ﬁve security goals for
BGP (cf. [23, 24]). G1 and G2 relate to data origin au-
thentication, G3 to data integrity, and G4 and G5 to the
propriety of BGP messages.
G1. (AS Number Authentication) It must be veriﬁable
that an entity using an AS number s i as its own
is in fact an authorized representative of the AS to
which a recognized AS number authority assigned
si.
G2. (BGP Speaker Authentication) It must be veriﬁable
that a BGP speaker, which asserts an association
with an AS number si, has been authorized by the
AS to which si was assigned by a recognized AS
number authority.
G3. (Data Integrity) It must be veriﬁable that a BGP
message has not been illegally modiﬁed en route.
G4. (Preﬁx Origination Veriﬁcation) It must be veriﬁ-
able that it is proper for an AS to originate an IP
preﬁx. More speciﬁcally, it is proper for AS s 1 to
originate preﬁx f1 if 1) f1 is owned by s1; or 2)
f1 is aggregated from a set F of preﬁxes such that
f1 ⊆ F , i.e., ∀fx ⊆ f1, fx ⊆ F 1.
G5. (AS Path Veriﬁcation) It must be veriﬁable that an
AS PATH (pk = [s1, s2, . . . , sk]) of a BGP route
m consists of a sequence of ASes actually traversed
by m in the speciﬁed order, i.e., m originates from
s1, and has traversed through s 2, . . . , sk in order.
3. Pretty Secure BGP (psBGP)
psBGP makes use of a centralized trust model for au-
thenticating AS numbers and AS public keys. RIRs are
the root trusted certiﬁcate authorities. Each AS s is is-
sued a public key certiﬁcate (ASNumCert), signed by
one of the RIRs, denoted by (ks, s)T . An AS with an
ASNumCert (ks, s)T creates and signs two data struc-
tures: a SpeakerCert (k(cid:1)
s to
s; and a preﬁx assertion list (PAL), listing preﬁx asser-
tions made by s about the preﬁx ownership of s and s’s
peers. PALs is an ordered list: the ﬁrst assertion is for
s itself and the rest are for each of s’s peers ordered by
AS number. Figure 1 illustrates the certiﬁcate structure
used in psBGP (see also §3.4.1 re: MultiASCert). We
next describe psBGP with respect to ﬁve security goals,
corresponding to G1-G5 above.

[37] for AS number authentication, with four root Cer-

tiﬁcate Authorities (CAs), corresponding to the four ex-
isting RIRs. When an organization B applies for an
AS number, besides supplying documents currently re-
quired (e.g., routing policy, peering ASes, etc.), B addi-
tionally supplies a public key, and should be required to
prove the possession of the corresponding private key
[37, 1]. When an AS number is granted to B by an
RIR, a public key certiﬁcate (ASNumCert) is also is-
sued, signed by the issuing RIR, binding the public key
supplied by B to the granted AS number. An AS num-
ber s is called certiﬁed if there is a valid ASNumCert
(ks, s)T , binding s to a public key ks signed by one of
the RIRs.
The proposed PKI for authenticating AS numbers is
practical for the following reasons. 1) The roots of the
proposed PKI are the existing trusted authorities of the
AS number space, removing a major trust issue which
is probably one of the most difﬁcult parts of a PKI. The
root of a PKI must have control over the name space in-
volved in that PKI. Thus, RIRs are the natural and logi-
cal AS number certiﬁcate authorities, though admittedly
non-trivial (but feasible) effort might be required for im-
plementing such a PKI. 2) The number of ASes on the
Internet and its growth rate are relatively manageable
(see §6 - Table 3). Considering there are four RIRs, the
overhead of managing ASNumCerts should certainly be
feasible as large PKIs are currently commercially oper-
ational [16].
To verify the authenticity of an ASNumCert, an AS
must have the trusted public key (or certiﬁcate) of the
signing RIR. These few root trusted public key certiﬁ-
cates can be distributed using out-of-band mechanisms.
ASNumCerts can be distributed with BGP update mes-
sages. An ASNumCert is revoked when the correspond-
ing AS number is not used or reassigned to another or-
ganization. Issues of revocation, though extremely im-
portant, are beyond the scope of the present paper; we
restrict comment to the observation that revocation is a
well-studied issue, if albeit still challenging (e.g., see
[1]). So far, we assume that every AS has the public key
certiﬁcates of RIRs and can obtain the ASNumCerts of
any other ASes if and when necessary.
There is much debate on the architecture for authenti-
cating the public keys of ASes in the BGP security com-
munity, particularly on the pros and cons of using a strict
hierarchical trust model vs. a distributed trust model,
e.g., a web-of-trust model. We make use of a strict hi-
erarchical trust model (with depth of one) for authenti-
cating AS numbers and their public keys to provide a
strong guarantee of security. Therefore, it will be dif-
ﬁcult for an attacker to spoof an AS as long as it can-
not compromise or steal the private key corresponding
to the public key of an ASNumCert signed by an RIR
or the signing key of an RIR. In contrast, a web-of-trust
model does not provide such a guarantee. Some other is-
sues that arise with a web-of-trust model might include:
trust bootstrapping, trust transitivity, and vulnerability to
a single misbehaving party [28, 36].
3.2. BGP Speaker Authentication in psBGP
An AS may have one or more BGP speakers. A BGP
speaker must be authorized by an AS to represent that
AS to establish a peer relationship with another AS. In
psBGP, an AS with a certiﬁed ASNumCert issues an op-
erational public key certiﬁcate shared by all BGP speak-
ers within the AS, namely SpeakerCert. A SpeakerCert
is signed using the private key of the issuing AS, corre-
sponding to the public key in the AS’s ASNumCert (see
Figure 1). A SpeakerCert is an assertion made by an AS
that a BGP speaker with the corresponding private key
is authorized to represent that AS. SpeakerCerts can be
distributed with BGP update messages.
We consider three design choices for BGP speaker au-
thentication: 1) each BGP speaker is issued a unique
public key certiﬁcate; 2) group signatures (e.g., see [8])
are used, i.e., each BGP speaker has a unique private key
but shares a common public key certiﬁcate with other
speakers in the same AS; or 3) all BGP speakers in a
given AS share a common public-private key pair. We
propose the latter primarily for its operational simplicity.
Choice 1) provides stronger security but requires more
certiﬁcates, and discloses BGP speaker identities. Such
disclosure may or may not introduce competitive secu-
rity concerns [40]. Choice 2) provides stronger security,
requires the same number of certiﬁcates, and does not
disclose BGP identities, but involves a more complex
system.
The private key corresponding to the public key of a
SpeakerCert is used for establishing secure connections
with peers (§3.3), and for signing BGP messages. There-
fore, it must be stored in the communication device asso-
ciated with a BGP speaker. In contrast, since the private
key corresponding to the public key of an ASNumCert is
only used for signing a SpeakerCert and a PAL, it need
not be stored in a BGP speaker. Thus, compromising a
BGP speaker only discloses the private key of a Speak-
erCert, requiring revocation and reissuing of a Speak-
erCert, without impact on an ASNumCert. This separa-
tion of ASNumCerts from SpeakerCerts provides a more
conservative design (from a security viewpoint), and dis-
tributes from RIRs to ASes the workload of certiﬁcate
revocation and reissuing resulting from BGP speaker
compromises. In summary, an ASNumCert must be re-
voked if the corresponding AS number is re-assigned or
the corresponding key is compromised. A SpeakerCert
must be revoked if a BGP speaker in that AS is com-
promised, or for other reasons (e.g., if the private key is
lost).
3.3. Data Integrity in psBGP
To protect data integrity, BGP sessions between peers
must be protected. Following S-BGP and soBGP, ps-
BGP uses IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
[22] with null encryption for protecting BGP sessions.
Since many existing BGP speakers implement TCP
MD5 [18] with manual key conﬁgurations for protecting
BGP sessions, it must be supported by psBGP as well.
In psBGP, automatic key management techniques can be
implemented to improve the security of TCP MD5 as
each BGP speaker has a public-private key pair (com-
mon to all speakers in that AS).
3.4. Veriﬁcation of Preﬁx Origin in psBGP
When an AS si originates a BGP update message m =
(f, [si, . . . ]), another AS needs to verify if it is proper
for si to originate a route for a preﬁx f . As stated in §2.4
(G4), it is proper for si to originate a route for preﬁx f if:
1) si owns f ; or 2) si aggregates f properly from a set
F of preﬁxes carried by a set of routes s i has received,
possibly combined with some preﬁxes owned by s i.
3.4.1. Veriﬁcation of Preﬁx Ownership in psBGP
Facing the difﬁculty of building an IP address delega-
tion infrastructure (recall §1), we propose a decentral-
ized approach for verifying the propriety of IP address
ownership, and more speciﬁcally by using consistency
checks. Our approach is inspired by the way humans ac-
quire their trust in the absence of a trusted authority: by
corroborating information from multiple sources (hope-
fully independent).

of the form (IP preﬁx list, AS number), i.e., PAL si =
