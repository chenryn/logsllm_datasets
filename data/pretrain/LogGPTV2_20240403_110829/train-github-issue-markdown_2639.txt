Let's say I ran
    npx playwright test --grep=@test
Is there a way that I can programatically get names of all test files that are
about to run, in e.g. `globalSetup`? Right now there's a way to do this with
CLI
    npx playwright test --grep=@test --list
But can I get this list in code, like from env variable or something?
