## üìù Provide a description of the new feature
Basically when you want a virtual desktop you click WIN+CTRL+D and you can
keep creating it. Now when you hit CTRL+3 it'll go to Virtual Desktop 3.
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_  
Currently you have option to CTRL+WIN+Arrow keys to go left or right between
the Virtual Desktop but you can't jump to say from Desktop 5 to Desktop 2. You
can also use WIN+TAB and use the mouse to click the desired Desktop or Click
the TASK View to view Virtual Desktops and then click. Too long of a process,
where as with pressing CTRL+2 you should be able to jump from Desktop 5 or
from any other, of course if you are already on Desktop 2, no action.
I found something but it's not stable or it works sometimes and doesn't once I
restart the PC, I've even tried to add the program as service but no success.
Will include the file that explains the feature and the program AutoHotKeys
creates but not stable, The file type was AHK but saved it as TXT.
I enjoy the Power Toy very much and love the feature FancyZone, as it helps
with multiple windows and adding the shortcut for switching between multiple
desktop would be icing on the cake. This could aid others in multi tasking and
keeping all organized and focused since multi tasks are spread over multi
desktops.
Thanks,
