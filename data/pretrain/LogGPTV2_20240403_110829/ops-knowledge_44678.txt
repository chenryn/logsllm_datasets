User: The DNS resolution results of domain names can be monitored through network monitoring software. Please explain the DNS resolution process and its mechanism, and how to judge whether the DNS resolution result is correct or wrong.
Assistant: DNS resolution is the process of converting a domain name into a corresponding IP address. The DNS resolution process can be simply divided into the following steps: 1. The DNS client initiates a query request to the local DNS server, asking for the IP address corresponding to the domain name. 2. If the local DNS server has cached the query result, it will return it directly to the DNS client. 3. If the local DNS server has no cache, it will send a query request to the root DNS server. 4. The root DNS server returns a list of next-level DNS server addresses, and the local DNS server randomly selects one of the addresses to send a query request to it. 5. The next-level DNS server will return an address list to the local DNS server in the same way, and then the local DNS server will randomly select and send a query request to it again. 6. Until the local DNS server finds the IP address corresponding to the target domain name and caches the result locally, the result can be returned directly in the next query. The correctness of the DNS resolution result can be judged from the following aspects: 1. Whether the resolution result is the same as the expected IP address. 2. Whether the analysis result is the same as the IP address actually deployed on the website. 3. Whether the TTL of the analysis result has expired. TTL (Time-To-Live) is the effective time of the cache of DNS resolution results. If it times out, the query request needs to be sent to the DNS server again. 4. Check whether the DNS server has been hijacked. If the DNS server is tampered with by malicious attackers, the resolution results it returns may be malicious.
