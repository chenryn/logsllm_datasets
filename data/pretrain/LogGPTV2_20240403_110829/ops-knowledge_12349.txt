**User:**
Is it possible to run a Jupyter notebook server with kernels scheduled as processes on a remote cluster (via SSH or PBS), using a shared directory on NFS? 

For example, I have three servers with GPUs and would like to run a Jupyter notebook on one of them. However, I prefer not to start more than one notebook server. Ideally, I would have the notebook server running on a fourth machine, which could schedule kernels either automatically or manually.

I have experimented with creating a cluster with a single engine. Using `%%px` in each cell is almost a solution, but it lacks introspection capabilities, and the notebook code becomes dependent on the cluster configuration, which is not ideal.

**Assistant:**
At this time, the Jupyter notebook server does not natively support using a kernel that it did not start itself. 

However, you might be able to achieve this by writing a custom `KernelManager` that starts kernels remotely across your machines and integrates it into the notebook server. It is important to note that you cannot directly attach an existing kernel or engine to the notebook server.
