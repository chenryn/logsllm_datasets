Abstract—Gun violence results in a signiﬁcant number of
deaths in the United States. Starting in the 1960’s, the US
Congress passed a series of gun control laws to regulate the sale
and use of ﬁrearms. One of the most important but politically
fraught gun control measures is a national gun registry. A US
Senate ofﬁce is currently drafting legislation that proposes the
creation of a voluntary national gun registration system. At a
high level, the bill envisions a decentralized system where local
county ofﬁcials would control and manage the registration data
of their constituents. These local databases could then be queried
by other ofﬁcials and law enforcement to trace guns. Due to the
sensitive nature of this data, however, these databases should
guarantee the conﬁdentiality of the data.
In this work, we translate the high-level vision of the proposed
legislation into technical requirements and design a crypto-
graphic protocol that meets them. Roughly speaking, the protocol
can be viewed as a decentralized system of locally-managed
end-to-end encrypted databases. Our design relies on various
cryptographic building blocks including structured encryption,
secure multi-party computation and secret sharing. We propose
a formal security deﬁnition and prove that our design meets
it. We implemented our protocol and evaluated its performance
empirically at the scale it would have to run if it were deployed
in the United States. Our results show that a decentralized and
end-to-end encrypted national gun registry is not only possible
in theory but feasible in practice.
I. INTRODUCTION
Gun violence accounts for a considerable number of deaths
in the United States. 36, 000 Americans are killed by guns
every year and another 100, 000 are injured. Around 2/3 of
gun deaths are suicides and 1/3 are homicides. Among high-
income countries, 93% of children (14 and under) that are
killed by guns are American. Each year 600 Women are shot
and killed by an intimate partner and 4.5 million Women have
been threatened with a gun. Black people are 10 times more
likely to be killed by a gun than Whites and Black men account
for 52% of gun deaths [18].
Gun control. In the US, ﬁrearms are regulated by a set
of laws, regulations and policies commonly referred to as
gun control laws. At the national level, the most prominent
gun control laws are the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe
Streets Act of 1968, which prohibited the interstate sale of
handguns and increased the minimum age to purchase a gun
to 21; the Gun Control Act of 1968 which established the
Federal Firearms License system which requires gun sellers
to be licensed; and the Brady Act of 1993 which instituted
the system of background checks, requiring sellers to check
the criminal history of buyers. Another important gun control
law is the Firearm Owner Protection Act (FOPA) of 1986
which amends some of the provisions of the Gun Control
Act. One of the main provisions of FOPA was to prohibit
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)
from keeping a registry that maps guns to their owners. More
precisely, the Act states:
No such rule or
regulation...may require that
records...be recorded at or transferred to a facility
owned, managed, or controlled by the United States
or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor
that any system of registration of ﬁrearms, ﬁrearms
owners, or ﬁrearms transactions or dispositions be
established.
Gun tracing. Gun tracing is the tracking of guns recovered
by law enforcement. In the US, it is conducted by the ATF’s
National Tracing Center in West Virginia. When a gun is
recovered by law enforcement, a trace can be requested based
on the gun’s serial number and characteristics. Because FOPA
prohibits the existence of databases that map owners to guns
and prevents data on ﬁrearms from being searchable [37], gun
tracing is done manually by searching through physical stacks
of paper. This requires, on average, 4 to 7 business days [36].
Furthermore, searches cannot be run on the text of a record or
using speciﬁc tags or identiﬁers. On average there are 1, 500
traces a day and about 370, 000 a year and only 65% of search
requests are successfully answered. FOPA even requires gun
dealers to get a special exemption by the ATF to use electronic
or cloud-based computing systems to store their data [26].
A decentralized national registry. US Senator Wyden’s ofﬁce
is currently drafting legislation that proposes the creation of a
voluntary national system of ﬁrearm licensing and registration.
The core idea behind the bill
is to provide ﬁnancial and
legislative incentives for US counties that choose to participate
in the system. Two crucial aspects of the proposed design
are to guarantee: (1) the conﬁdentiality of the data; and
(2) that
local ofﬁcials maintain complete control of their
constituents’ data. Control, here, means the ability to “pull”
the data from the system at any point in time. From a technical
perspective, these requirements roughly translate to designing
a distributed and decentralized system of locally-managed end-

to-end encrypted databases that would allow for efﬁcient gun
tracing without compromising the privacy of gun owners.
At a high level, the legislation would require all gun owners
in a participating US county to register their ﬁrearms with a
local ofﬁcial by providing information about the make, model,
caliber or gauge, and serial number along with the owner’s
registration number. This information would be stored in an
end-to-end encrypted database whose key is known only to the
local ofﬁcial. The encrypted database itself would be hosted
on state servers or the cloud to guarantee a higher degree of
availability. A county’s encrypted database would be queryable
by law enforcement agents and other ofﬁcials but the query
process would be overseen by the county’s ofﬁcial. In addition,
the system needs to remain functional even if a county’s local
ofﬁcial is ofﬂine. As mentioned above, county ofﬁcials should
also have the ability to pull their database from the system
entirely at any point in time.
Impact of the proposed system. The system envisioned by
this legislation would be part of a broader set of existing gun
control laws and background check system. It would allow for
faster and more accurate gun tracing which, in turn, would
help in violent criminal cases and possibly act as a deterrent
from illegally transferring ﬁrearms. A possible critique of the
system is the expense of running it. Another possible critique
is allowing law enforcement to obtain and query this data
could lead to the Federal government conﬁscating people’s
ﬁrearms and, therefore, violating the second amendment. The
legislation and envisioned system addresses these concerns by
requiring that the databases that store registration records be
end-to-end encrypted with a key held and managed by a local
county ofﬁcial.
Our contributions. The purpose of this work is to ascertain
whether the high-level design goals of the proposed legisla-
tion are technically feasible. Towards this end we make the
following contributions:
• (Cryptographic design) as a ﬁrst step, we translated
the high-level requirements of the legislation to a set
of technical requirements. We then designed a novel
cryptographic protocol
to satisfy them. The protocol
can be roughly viewed as a decentralized collection of
end-to-end multi-user encrypted databases. It makes use
of a variety of cryptographic building blocks including
two-party and multi-party secure computation, structured
encryption and secret sharing. At a very high level, the
system is composed of a encrypted global directory that
allows authorized parties to ﬁnd the county associated to
a serial number; and of a set of local encrypted databases
that store the full records and that are owned and managed
by a local county ofﬁcial. As far as we know, this kind
of protocol and system has never been considered in the
past.
• (Formal security deﬁnition) we formulate a security deﬁ-
nition for such a decentralized registry and show that our
protocol satisﬁes it. Our deﬁnition is in the ideal/real-
world paradigm which is standard in cryptography.
• (Deployment considerations) in our setting,
there are
many real-world considerations that need to be taken into
account that are not captured by our abstract protocol.
We identify these considerations and describe how our
cryptographic protocol should be deployed in practice.
• (Prototype & evaluation) we implement our protocol
and evaluate it empirically. Our evaluation shows that
the protocol is practical at the scale of the US. More
precisely, assuming the system stores 400 million records,
where the largest county has 50 million records 1 it takes
300 ms to identify the county that a gun is registered in
and at most 1 minute to query the county’s local database
on a query that matches 100 records. Adding a batch of
10, 000 records to the system takes 45 minutes.
Though our work was motivated directly by the legislation
mentioned above and our solution is relatively unique, we be-
lieve that our design could prove useful for other decentralized
systems that need to store sensitive data.
II. RELATED WORK
Gun registries exists at the state level in the United States
and in other countries. Canada implemented a national ﬁrearms
registry through its Firearms Act in 1995, which was later
dismantled in 2012. Since then, Quebec has implemented its
own Firearms Registry. In 2019, New Zealand proposed legis-
