##### Detailed description
    import cv2
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        #print(ret)
        print(frame)
It prints the 3 channel array values as zero.  
I want to take the array values real time and process them into my function.  
I know that ret is True and that my camera is reading the values because when
I print frame.sum(), it gives me the sum of array values but for some reason I
can't see it in an array form and hence my function reads the frame as a set
of 0's.  
Any help about how I can read the array values would be very useful.
Thanks!
