User: I am trying to implement AJAX in my Google App Engine application, and so I am looking for a good AJAX framework that will help me. Anyone has any idea?
I am thinking about Google Web Toolkit, how good it is in terms of creating AJAX for Google App Engine?
Assistant: I'm currently using JQuery for my GAE app and it works beautifully for me. I have a chart (google charts) that is dynamic and uses an Ajax call to grab a JSON string. It really seems to work fine for me.
