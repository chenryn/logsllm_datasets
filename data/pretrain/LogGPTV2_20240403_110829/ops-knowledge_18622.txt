I am in the process of incorporating AJAX into my Google App Engine (GAE) application and am seeking a reliable AJAX framework to facilitate this. Could anyone provide recommendations?

I have been considering the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). How effective is GWT for developing AJAX functionality within the context of a Google App Engine application?

In response to your query, I currently utilize jQuery for my own GAE application, and it has proven to be highly effective. Specifically, I have implemented a dynamic chart using Google Charts, which makes an AJAX call to retrieve a JSON string. This setup works seamlessly for me.
