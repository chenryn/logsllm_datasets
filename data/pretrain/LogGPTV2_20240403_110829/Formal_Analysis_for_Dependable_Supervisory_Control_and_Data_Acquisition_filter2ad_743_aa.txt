Abstract—Smart grids provide innovative and efﬁcient energy
management services that offer operational reliability. The Super-
visory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is a core
component of a smart grid. Unlike the traditional cyber networks,
these components consist of heterogeneous devices, such as
intelligent electronic devices, programmable logic controllers,
remote terminal units, control servers, routing and security
devices, etc. SCADA devices communicate with one another
under various communication protocols, physical media, and
security properties. Failures or attacks on such networks have the
potential of data unavailability and false data injection causing
incorrect system estimations and control decisions leading to
critical damages including power outages and destruction of
equipment. In this work, we develop an automated security and
resiliency analysis framework for SCADA in smart grids. This
framework takes smart grid conﬁgurations and organizational
security and resiliency requirements as inputs, formally models
conﬁgurations and various security constraints, and veriﬁes the
dependability of the system under potential contingencies. We
demonstrate the execution of this framework on an example
problem. We also evaluate the scalability of the framework on
synthetic SCADA systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the energy transmission and distribution side of the
smart grid, different communication networks exist for sens-
ing measurements and transmitting control commands. These
networks are associated with the SCADA system. SCADA
is the major Industrial Control System (ICS) in smart grids,
and connects the generating stations, substations, and control
centers. SCADA is mainly responsible for monitoring and
controlling the remote equipment by obtaining data from the
remote devices, analyzing the received data at the control
centers, and executing necessary control commands at the
remote devices.
The control centers associated with the generation, trans-
mission, and distribution systems are connected to the physical
power system using cyber infrastructure. In order to promote
connectivity and remote access capabilities among corporate
business systems, information technology (IT) is now increas-
ingly used in SCADA, which escalates the possibility of cyber
security vulnerabilities and incidents, as ICS was not built
taking security into consideration. Although there are some
similarities between the characteristics of ICS and that of
traditional IT systems, they differ in many places, especially
due to the simultaneous existence of physical components and
network components and different industrial communications
protocols. Moreover, in order to operate the grid efﬁciently and
reliably, various control routines are executing at the control
centers which are actively dependent on the data acquisition
from the ﬁeld devices. Therefore,
the vulnerabilities and
threats as well as the security and resiliency requirements of
SCADA are often different from that of the traditional IT
systems. Therefore, it is important to develop an automated
security and resiliency veriﬁcation framework explicitly for
SCADA in smart grids.
In this paper, we present a formal framework that automati-
cally veriﬁes the security and resiliency of the SCADA system,
particularly the resilient data acquisition for reliable execution
of control operations. This framework takes necessary SCADA
conﬁgurations and resiliency requirements, formally models
the analytics, and solves the model to verify the system with
respect to the given resiliency speciﬁcations. This framework
uses an SMT-based formal analysis engine [1] to solve the
model. The framework provides threat vectors if the resiliency
requirement fails. The unsatisﬁable outcome certiﬁes the spec-
iﬁed resiliency of the system. Therefore, this framework allows
a grid operator to understand the SCADA system’s resiliency
as well as to ﬁx the system by analyzing the threat vectors.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss
necessary background for this work in the next section. We
present formal models for the SCADA security analysis, which
includes the formal modeling of SCADA conﬁgurations and
that of SCADA resiliency constraints in Section III. We
illustrate a case study with respect
to a 5-bus system in
Section IV. We brieﬂy discuss the related work in Section VI
and conclude the paper in Section VII.
II. STATE OF THE ART, CHALLENGES, AND OBJECTIVES
A. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are often found in in-
dustries, such as electric, water, oil, natural gas, chemical,
transportation, etc. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) systems are examples of ICS systems, which are
generally used in controlling dispersed assets using central-
ized data acquisition and supervisory control. An example
topology of SCADA is shown in Fig. 1. Typical SCADA
operations includes automatic and human control loops, re-
mote diagnostics, and maintenance utilities. There are various

kinds of control components, such as SCADA control servers
or Master Terminal Units (MTUs), Remote Terminal Units
(RTUs), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Intelligent
Electronic Devices (IED), Human Machine Interfaces (HMI),
data historian, etc. In addition to these control components,
there are different network components, such as communi-
cations routers, modems, and remote access points. These
components usually use ICS protocols like Modbus, DNP3,
or IEC 61850 variants for communicating with one another.
The SCADA control server takes the sensor measurements
from ﬁeld devices through the power network and sends the
control commands to them after analyzing the data using the
same infrastructure. There are different control modules or
routines to manage the grid efﬁciently and reliably [2], [3].
Among these modules, state estimation is the core component.
Its function is to compute the unknown state variables of the
power system from the sensor measurements received through
the SCADA system. The output of state estimation is used in
other control mechanisms to operate the grid optimally with
respect to the generation cost and the physical safety of the
grid. Therefore, the dependable delivery of data is crucial.
B. Potential Cyber Threats on SCADA
The increasing use of IT in smart grids escalates the
possibility of cyber security vulnerabilities and incidents, as
these systems have not been built taking security into consid-
eration in the ﬁrst place. The inherent complexity associated
with integrating different heterogeneous and legacy systems
in SCADA signiﬁcantly increases the potential of security
threats, which can cause massive and devastating damage.
There are two main causes of threats [4]. The ﬁrst is the
misconﬁguration or the lack of security controls that can
cause inconsistency, unreachability, broken security tunnels,
and many other security breaches. The second is the weakness
or absence of resiliency controls that can lead to cascaded
failures in contingencies or cyber attacks. As an example of
cyber attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can make one
or more ﬁeld devices unreachable or unavailable to or from
the rest of the system.
The main purpose of SCADA is to deliver measurement
data from the ﬁeld or physical devices (meters/sensors) to the
provider’s side (control center or utility), while delivering con-
trol commands from the provider’s side to the ﬁeld/physical

devices. To achieve successful data delivery, reachability must
hold between the sender and the receiver. Inconsistencies in
communication protocols or authentication/encryption param-
eters of the communicating devices may cause failed data
transmission leading to service disruptions. In addition, data
should be delivered such that it satisﬁes end-to-end integrity.
The violation of this requirement not only can cause incorrect
estimation of the system, but may also launch malicious
control commands toward physical devices. This scenario
becomes worse in the case of contingencies, when some IEDs
or RTUs fails due to technical errors or cyber attacks, as there
may not be enough (secured) measurements received by the
control server to observe the whole system accurately.
C. Objectives
The correct functioning of SCADA stands on consistent and
secure execution of tasks in time. The safe security conﬁgura-
tion depends not only on the local device parameters but also
on the secure interactions and ﬂows of these parameters across
the network including SCADA control mechanisms. There is
a signiﬁcant number of logical constraints on conﬁguration
parameters of many SCADA devices, which need to be satis-
ﬁed to ensure safe and secure communications among SCADA
components, while keeping the system stable during contin-
gencies. Implementing these security and resiliency controls in
a scalable and provable manner is one of the major challenges
in smart grid security modeling.
The goal of this research is to develop a framework that
can allow energy providers to objectively assess and inves-
tigate SCADA security conﬁgurations to identify potential
resiliency threats, and to enforce smart grid operational and
organizational security requirements. This research aims at
modeling secured communication, potential contingencies, and
resiliency speciﬁcations, and at creating an efﬁcient solution to
analyze the resiliency of the system by identifying the threat
vectors that negate the security and resiliency requirements.
The research approach targets scalable and extensible design of
the resiliency veriﬁcation as a constraint satisfaction problem.
In this work, we particularly focus on modeling the trusted
and secure data communication from the ﬁeld devices to the
control server such that SCADA control routines can operate
with valid data even in contingencies. Although this paper
presents formalizations for a limited set of constraints that are
important for proper communication, an important feature of
the proposed formal framework is its easy extensibility. For
further properties, one just needs to add necessary constraints.

operation (i.e., the data requirements for the process), and
the resiliency speciﬁcations. The analyzer formally models
SCADA conﬁgurations, reachability among communicating
parties, operational requirements, secured delivery, and the
violation of resiliency speciﬁcations as constraints, and en-
codes these constraints into SMT logics. Then, these con-
straints are solved using an efﬁcient SMT solver [5]. The
solution result provides resiliency threat vectors (i.e., how the
resiliency requirements can be violated). If no threat is found,
then it speciﬁes that the system satisﬁes the given resiliency
speciﬁcations. The formal modeling for the SCADA security
and resiliency veriﬁcation is discussed in the following in three
parts. First, we model SCADA conﬁgurations. Then, we model
the veriﬁcation of operational resiliency of a control process.
Lastly, we present the modeling of the resiliency of secured
execution of the control operation.
The security and resiliency requirements that we consider
in this work ensure whether or not a SCADA control process
receives sufﬁcient data (i.e., measurements from ﬁeld devices)
to perform its operation even in (limited) contingencies. We
choose the observability analysis, which is a prior and crucial
requirement for performing the power system state estimation
control routine [2], [3]. Moreover, we consider the secured
(particularly, authenticated and integrity protected) commu-
nication of the data that can provide correct results while
adversaries can inject false data. Thus, we address mainly
three resiliency speciﬁcations: (i) k−resilient observability, (ii)
k−resilient secured observability, and (iii) k, r−resilient bad
data detectability.
B. Formal Modeling of SCADA Conﬁgurations
A SCADA network consists of different types of devices,
heterogeneous communication links, and various security poli-
cies. However, we present the formalizations of some selective
conﬁgurations that are crucial to model security constraints.
Table I includes a list of notations used in these formalizations.
Modeling of SCADA Device Conﬁgurations:
SCADA consists of different physical device components,
among which IEDs, PLCs, RTUs, and MTUs are important.
Usually IEDs, PLCS, and RTUs are associated with sub-
stations, while an MTU is associated with a control center.
IEDs, PLCs, and RTUs are referred to as ﬁeld devices. We
model the SCADA physical devices, particularly IEDs, RTUs,
and an MTU, based on their communication and security
conﬁgurations. These properties are essential to model the
reachability and secured communication.
