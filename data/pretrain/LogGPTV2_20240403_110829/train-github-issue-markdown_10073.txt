This issue is part of #8765
## Rule
Create `TaskHandlersMovedRule` which corresponds to
> GCSTaskHandler has been moved, WasbTaskHandler has been moved,
> StackdriverTaskHandler has been moved , S3TaskHandler has been moved,
> ElasticsearchTaskHandler has been moved, CloudwatchTaskHandler has been
> moved
entry in UPDATING.md. This rule should allow users to check if their current
configuration needs any adjusting  
before migration to Airflow 2.0.
## How to guide
To implement a new rule, create a class that inherits from
`airflow.upgrade.rules.base_rule.BaseRule`.  
It will be auto-registered and used by `airflow upgrade-check` command. The
custom rule class has to have `title`,  
`description` properties and should implement `check` method which returns a
list of error messages in case of  
incompatibility.
For example:  
airflow/airflow/upgrade/rules/conn_type_is_not_nullable.py
Lines 25 to 42 in ea36166
|  class ConnTypeIsNotNullableRule(BaseRule):  
---|---  
|  
|  title = "Connection.conn_type is not nullable"  
|  
|  description = """\  
|  The `conn_type` column in the `connection` table must contain content.
Previously, this rule was \  
|  enforced by application logic, but was not enforced by the database schema.  
|  
|  If you made any modifications to the table directly, make sure you don't
have null in the conn_type column.\  
|  """

|  @provide_session

session.query(Connection).filter(Connection.conn_type.is_(None))  
|  return (
