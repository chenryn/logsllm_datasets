### Problem description
After I have converted my ReactJS Application to server-side rendering, many
of my material UI components have broken styles. The most notable example is
the GridTile in the GridList. For example, I am loading some images, and the
GridTile cellHeight property doesn't work as expected. It doesn't affect the
Height of the GridTiles, as result the Image height is huge.
Also, I am getting this warning almost on every component when I refreshing
the page :

I have Warped my Component with MuiTheheProvider Like this:
Both on the server and on the client, also I have set these globals on my
express server index.
    global.navigator = global.navigator || {};
    global.navigator.userAgent = global.navigator.userAgent || 'all';
Any Suggestions?
