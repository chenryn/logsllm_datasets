Intelligence in the IoT Security Services
(AI-IOTS 2020)
ThefirstInternationalWorkshoponArtificialIntelligenceintheIoTSecurityServices
(AI-IOTS 2020) was collocated with the 18th International Conference on Service
Oriented Computing (ICSOC 2020), and held on December 14, 2020, on a virtual
platform.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the disciplines of computer science that
emergesinsecuringInternetofThings(IoT)services.AItechniquesincludingmachine
learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning approaches have been applied to
emerging IoT applications in various fields such as smart cities, smart homes, smart
grids, health care, smart transportation, smart farming, etc.
According to Gartner, the total number of IoT connected devices will reach 75.44
billionunitsworldwideby2025.Thesedevicesgenerateanenormousamountofdata,
and the handling and analysis of this data are the current requirements of any appli-
cation. This trend poses several challenges in building efficient and reliable IoT sys-
tems. Due to the advancement in AI technology, the connected devices are getting
smaller and smarter but the provisioning of secured services and the constraints to be
satisfied are increasingly complex and challenging. The AI plays a crucial role to
managehugedataflowsandstorageintheIoTnetwork.AsIoTgainsitsfullpotential,
AI will be at the forefront to promote the potential of IoT.
The focused themes of AI-TOTS 2020 were services in the Internet of Things
(IoT) and security, privacy, and trust for services.
TheworkshophadagoodresponsefromtheresearchersoftheIOTcommunityand
four papers were accepted after two to three rounds of reviews and revisions. The
authors of the accepted papers were from Bulgaria, India, West Africa, and the USA.
The papers were well presented and demos/results were included by every author,
which received good feedback. The session chairs were Dr. P. Arun Raj Kumar, NIT
Calicut, India, Dr. A. R. Vasudevan, NIT Calicut, India, and Dr. N.G. Bhuvaneswari
Amma, IIIT Una, India.
The keynote talk on “Data replication and caching issues in large IoT infrastruc-
tures”wasdeliveredbyProf.K.Ravindran,fromtheDepartmentofComputerScience,
CityUniversityofNewYork,USA.Thetalkfocusedonhowdataandsoftwarecanbe
replicated in a secure IoT system, and the engineering and operational constraints
therein.

amicrocontroller(Wi-Fienabled),RFIDtag,vibrationmotor,andLED.TheRFID
tag provides each staff member with a unique ID. It is detected by other modules
placed at various compliance checkpoints across the hospital to identify staff. The
othermodulesusethisRFIDtagtouploadthestaff’scompliancestatustothecentral
server. The server processes this data and sends messages to the wristband module
whenhandwashoralcoholrubisneededorwhenhandhygienecomplianceisviolated.
The wristband module decodes this message and alerts staff through vibration and
LEDindications(Fig.3).
