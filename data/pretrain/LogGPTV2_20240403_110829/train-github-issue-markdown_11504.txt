### Problem Description
Looking to set my preload script directly inline in the webPreferences of
main.js.
I found these two PRs that seems to be about that (please correct if wrong):
#27741, #27546
But the threads state no updated information on when this is going to be
released and/or the syntax to use this feature.
So, Is this doable at the moment ? If so, could you post a short example on
how to do that ?
Thanks.
