### Description
The following code snippet demonstrates an issue with handling `NA` values in a NumPy array:

```python
In [13]: x = ones(5, maskna=1)
In [14]: x[2] = NA
In [15]: x.astype(double)
```

This results in the following traceback:

```python
ValueError: Cannot assign NA to an array which does not support NAs
```

### Analysis
It appears that the `astype` method is unable to handle the `NA` value in the array. This suggests that the `MASKNA` flag, which indicates that the array supports `NA` values, is not being properly propagated when the data type is changed.

### Proposed Solution
The most straightforward solution would be to ensure that the `MASKNA` flag is correctly propagated during the `astype` operation. This would allow the array to maintain its ability to handle `NA` values even after the data type conversion.

### Conclusion
To resolve this issue, we need to update the `astype` method to propagate the `MASKNA` flag. This will ensure that arrays with `NA` values can be safely converted to different data types while preserving their ability to handle missing data.
