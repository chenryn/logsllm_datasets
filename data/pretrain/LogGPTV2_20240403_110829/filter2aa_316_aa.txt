**Stack Black Ops**
Black Hat USA 2003
New Concepts for Network Manipulation
Dan Kaminsky, CISSP

**History: Peace through Superior Firepower**
- **"Black Ops of TCP/IP" @ Black Hat 2002**
  - "We're not getting new networks – so if we want new capabilities, we need to find ways of teasing desired (if unexpected) functionality from established systems."
- **Paketto Keiretsu, Nov. 2002**
  - Scanrand: High-Speed Network Auditor
  - Minewt: Userspace NAT Router
  - Linkcat: Simple Network Interface
  - Paratrace: Parasitic TCP Traceroute
  - Phentropy: Zalewskian Entropy Analysis
  - The goal is to bring new tools to the table, leveraging the primary advantage of the defender.
  - The defender does not need to be stealthy.

**How: Regions of Analysis**
- **Intersections between layers**
  - Layers are never entirely independent. What happens when redundant data disagrees?
- **Manipulation of assumptions**
  - Systems necessarily assume certain things to be always true about their environment. What happens when these assumptions are false?
- **The Human Factor**
  - Someone has to use all this technology; how can this information be compiled into a maximally useful form?

**Layer 2: ARP vs. IP**
- **Is it possible to acquire a usable IP address on a network that lacks a DHCP server?**
  - Classic approach: Sniff for broadcasted ARPs, find “gaps” between claimed IP addresses, and attempt static mapping.
  - **ARP: Translator between MAC and IP**
    - If the target is in the subnet, translate the target IP and send it to the MAC.
    - If not in the subnet, translate the IP of the router and send it to the MAC of the router.
  - **New Techniques**
    - **Router Detection:** The router will route even if the target was in the subnet.
    - **Subnet Detection:**
      - The router will ARP for us only if the IP is in the subnet range.
      - Subnets aren't randomly distributed.
      - A binary search across `ip_dst` will quickly show subnet boundaries.
    - **But what if all IP addresses are taken?**

**NAT-in-the-Middle**
- **Is it possible to acquire a usable IP address when all routable addresses are already in use?**
  - Yes, by splicing into existing ones.
  - **NAT allows multiple hosts to share the same externally viewable IP address.**
  - **"NAT-In-The-Middle"**
    - ARP Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack against an existing IP.
    - Create a second gateway router on the L2 subnet (using Minewt).
    - Outgoing packets to the second gateway MAC are NATted to the IP and added to the state table.
    - Incoming packets that match entries in the state table are NATted appropriately; those that don't go to the original IP holder.
  - **Also supports MAT-in-the-Middle:** All hosts can share an external IP, similar to NAT-DMZ without an inline router.

**More ARP Tricks**
- **Is it possible to detect a single-port, multi-host portscan across a switched LAN?**
  - Yes, by watching for the router to spew ARP Requests.
  - **Blind scans don't know about empty IPs, which don't show up in ARP caches.**
  - When empty IPs are hit by a router, they elicit a broadcast ARP from the router.
  - Even though no one can see everyone else being scanned, everyone can see the router preparing to do the scan.
  - **Data point for the threat model:**
    - Some routers (e.g., DSL) may flood the entire subnet with ARPs regularly.
    - Small number of IPs: Why wait for a request? Send out ARPs every 30 seconds and actively maintain the ARP cache.

**Raw Network Access: Linkcat**
- **Linkcat: Standard-I/O Interface to Ethernet**
  - Allows very simple command-line access to Ethernet.
  - **Plan 9:** Everything is a file.
  - **Unix:** Everything is a file or a small tool that does one thing well.
  - Works over SSH.
  - **New for Paketto2: Automatic Checksums** – write reasonably correct packets, and the checksum will be automatically corrected.

**Packet Zen #1: Strings**
- **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  lc –l00 –tp | strings --bytes=8
  ```
  - Output includes various strings from the network traffic, such as:
    - FastEthernet0/6
    - Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    - IOS (tm) C2900XL Software (C2900XL-H-M), Version 11.2(8)SA2
    - HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    - Server: Apache/1.3.26 (Unix) DAV/1.0.3 PHP/4.3.1

**Packet Zen #1.1: Strings (without Linkcat)**
- **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  tcpdump –w - -s2000 | strings –-bytes=8
  ```
  - Output includes various strings from the network traffic, such as:
    - M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1
    - Host:239.255.255.250:1900
    - SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.4p1
    - SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.4p1 Debian 1:3.4p1-4

**Packet Zen #2: Ping over Copy and Paste**
- **Example Commands:**
  ```bash
  root@arachnadox:~# ping www.news.com
  PING news.com (206.16.0.136): 56 data bytes
  64 bytes from 206.16.0.136: icmp_seq=0 ttl=243 time=61.4 ms
  root@arachnadox:~# lc -l00 -p "icmp and host www.news.com"
  ```
  - Output includes hexadecimal representations of the ICMP packets.
