User: How to protect network equipment and defend against DDoS attacks?
Assistant: 1. Update and maintain equipment: Regularly update and maintain the operating system, firewall, router, switch and other software and hardware of network equipment to ensure that the latest patches and security measures have been installed on the equipment. 2. Configure network security: configure appropriate firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) for all devices to limit unauthorized access and traffic flow. 3. Regular data backup: ensure the backup and recovery of device data, so that in the event of an attack or device failure, the business can be quickly restored. 4. Network isolation: divide the network into several subnets isolated from each other, which can restrain the spread of DDoS attacks, so that the attacks can only affect the target machine. 5. Limit inbound traffic: You can use inbound traffic filtering to limit access to IP addresses and ports that may contain attack traffic. 6. Reasonably configure the service port: limit the service port to the necessary port to avoid potential security risks caused by unnecessary service ports. 7. Network monitoring: Use technical tools such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Flow Analysis System (FAS) to ensure real-time monitoring of network traffic and equipment events, and to detect and respond to attacks in a timely manner. 8. Cooperate with ISPs: Cooperate with ISPs and use their own technologies and equipment to jointly respond to DDoS attacks and take timely protective measures. 9. Defense cloud service: Individuals and enterprises can use cloud defense and load balancing services, which can effectively resist DDoS attacks.
