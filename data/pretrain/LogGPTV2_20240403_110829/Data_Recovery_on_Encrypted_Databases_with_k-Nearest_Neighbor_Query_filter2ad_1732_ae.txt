of six months. A record is stored whenever the phone was
connected to a cell tower, received a call or sent a text. We
used the two-dimensional data from the date ranges 1-5 Oct.,
1-15 Oct., and 1-31 Oct., depicted in Figure 7. In all of our
experiments we used a Hilbert curve of order 7 and placed
the geolocation data in the center of the above Hilbert curve,
the size n of each dataset is denoted in Table I. We simulated
the k-NN query leakage of this setup and recorded the quality
of the reconstruction for different values of k = {2, 5, 8} and
number of queries m. The quality measures are the Chebyshev
distance between the original values and the reconstruction,

denoted as AbsoluteError-1D, and the max Euclidean distance
computed by inverting the mapping of the curve. Each of the
above setup was repeated 20 times for m queries that were
generated uniformly at random in [α, β]. We note that we did
not choose m based on the desired  guarantee, but rather
chose a value for m that is orders of magnitude smaller so as
to demonstrate that the attack needs fewer samples than the
derived bounds. The attack run on a commercial laptop and the
code is written in Matlab. For the vertex enumeration problem,
we use routines from the File Exchange of MathWorks [1].
We note here that not only size but also the distribution of
the data plays a signiﬁcant role in the success of our attack.
This can be seen from the role of the diam(F[v]) in the quality
of the reconstruction as well as in the statement of Theorem 6.
Thus, even though the number of encrypted values in our
experiments appears relatively small we can draw interesting
conclusions due to values being highly concentrated.
A. Evaluation of Unordered Response Attack
Table I gives an overview of our experiments. In the right
set of columns of Table I we present the accuracy of the
reconstruction across all three datasets for the same large
number of queries whereas in the left column we attempt to
signiﬁcantly reduce the number of observed queries without
compromising the quality of the reconstruction. As it
is
expected, if the exact diameter of the reconstruction class is
large then the reconstruction error is large as well. Interestingly,
the diameter of the estimated feasible region, denoted as
diameter est, is consistently close to the real one. Notice
that for smaller number of samples we have smaller success
percentage which means that no feasible region was found
because the constraints were not approximated in a satisfactory
accuracy. This trend does not appear when we increase the
number of observed queries, i.e. m = 800 · 106 on the right
column. To visualize the accuracy, Figure 7 illustrates the
reconstruction output for m = 800 · 106 and k = 2 across
all three datasets. Overall, the approximate reconstruction is
extremely accurate, from 0.003% to 0.1%, not only in one
dimension but also in two-dimensions as well.
A Visual Example of a Larger Dataset. In Figure 1, we
present a visualization of the accuracy of our reconstruction for
a larger dataset. On the left there is a picture of the Trojan horse
of 341 × 385 pixels, where each pixel is either black or white.
To create a two-dimensional data set we sampled pixels until
we collected n = 1840 black points that are uniquely mapped
on a Hilbert curve of order 7. The middle subplot of Figure 1
shows how the two-dimensional plaintext values are mapped to
the corresponding Hilbert curve. The feasible region for k = 9
has exact diameter 11.62. After observing m = 109 queries
our attack successfully forms an approximation of the feasible
region with diameter 7.03 which results into the reconstruction
depicted in the right plot. The visual similarity is conﬁrmed
by the absolute error in 1-D which is 2.84, i.e. relative error
1-D of 0.01%. Even in two dimensions the absolute error is
6.15 which is equivalent to relative error in 2-D of 0.01%.
For completeness we note that for this amount of queries the
attack failed for 2 ≤ k ≤ 4 and succeeded for 4 < k ≤ 9. This
phenomenon is explained in the next paragraph.
Why Reconstruction for Small k is Harder. According
to Table I, the percentage of failures is signiﬁcantly higher
for k = 2. To better understand why smaller k values require
tighter approximation guarantees, we note that by Lemma 6,
each ci,i+1 term of the ordering constraint vi < vi+1 consists
of the sum of a number of lengths of Voronoi segments. Since
our attack uses estimations of the above lengths, each term
comes with its corresponding error, . Thus, a sum of 500
length terms introduces 500  error since the error compounds.
