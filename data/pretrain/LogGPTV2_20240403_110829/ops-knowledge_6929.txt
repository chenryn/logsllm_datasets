User: I have a shell that runs CentOS.
For a project I'm doing, I need python 2.5+, but centOS is pretty dependent on 2.4.
From what I've read, a number of things will break if you upgrade to 2.5.
I want to install 2.5 separately from 2.4, but I'm not sure how to do it. So far I've downloaded the source tarball, untarred it, and did a ./configure --prefix=/opt which is where I want it to end up. Can I now just make, make install ? Or is there more?
Assistant: No, that's it. You might want to make sure you have all optional library headers installed too so you don't have to recompile it later. They are listed in the documentation I think.
Also, you can install it even in the standard path if you do make altinstall. That way it won't override your current default "python".
