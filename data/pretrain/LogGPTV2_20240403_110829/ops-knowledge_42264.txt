User:  Please design an enterprise-level application architecture, covering aspects such as interaction between modules, data storage, maintainability, and scalability.
Assistant: 1. Modular architecture: split the application into multiple modules, each module is responsible for specific business logic and data processing, and each module interacts through defined interfaces. This architecture can reduce the complexity of the system, improve maintainability and scalability. 2. Microservice Architecture: Split the system into multiple small service units, and each service unit can be deployed, maintained and expanded independently. Each service unit interacts through the defined interface. This architecture can improve the scalability and flexibility of the system. 3. Data layered architecture: Split application data into multiple layers, such as presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. This architecture can improve the maintainability and scalability of the system. 4. Distributed architecture: deploy the system to multiple servers and data centers, and realize collaborative work through network connections. This architecture can improve the scalability and high availability of the system. 5. Security architecture: Build a secure system architecture, including authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing. This architecture can protect the privacy of data and users and improve the security of the system. 6. Automated Architecture: Use automation tools and techniques to build, deploy, and maintain applications. This architecture improves efficiency and stability, and reduces the risk of human error.
