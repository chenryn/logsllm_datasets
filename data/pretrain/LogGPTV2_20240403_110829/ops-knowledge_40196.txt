User: I'm trying to add tesseract to be able to install pytesseract. 
I use Windows 7. 
I add this path to my PATH environmental variable
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
From the command line if I run
tesseract DMTX_screenshot.png out 
        OR
tesseract
I'm getting 
tesseract is not recognized as an internal or external command.
Here is a copy-paste of the a portion of my environmental variable:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe;C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda\geckodriver.exe;
Any ideas as to what I may be doing wrong? 
Thank you.
Assistant: I was also having this problem initially. Don't install tesseract via pip install tesseract.
Go to https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki and then download latest version for your computer and install that.
Then type sysdm.cpl and add the directory where tesseract.exe is present to env. variables.
for eg: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR
This solved it for me.
