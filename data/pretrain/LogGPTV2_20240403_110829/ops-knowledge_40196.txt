### Issue: Unable to Run Tesseract on Windows 7

**Problem Description:**
I am attempting to set up Tesseract to use with `pytesseract` on my Windows 7 system. I have added the following path to my `PATH` environment variable:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
```

However, when I run the command:

```sh
tesseract DMTX_screenshot.png out
```

or simply:

```sh
tesseract
```

I receive the error message:

```
'tesseract' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
```

Here is a portion of my `PATH` environment variable:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe;C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda\geckodriver.exe;
```

Could you please help me identify what I might be doing wrong?

**Thank you.**

### Solution

**Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Download and Install Tesseract:**
   - Do not install Tesseract via `pip install tesseract`.
   - Instead, download the latest version of Tesseract from the official repository: [UB-Mannheim Tesseract Wiki](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
   - Choose the appropriate installer for your system (e.g., `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20210506.exe` for 64-bit Windows).

2. **Add Tesseract to Environment Variables:**
   - After installing Tesseract, open the System Properties by typing `sysdm.cpl` in the Run dialog (Win + R).
   - Navigate to the "Advanced" tab and click on "Environment Variables."
   - In the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and click "Edit."
   - Add the directory where `tesseract.exe` is located. For example:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR
     ```
   - Ensure that the path does not include the `.exe` file, but rather the directory containing it.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type:
     ```sh
     tesseract --version
     ```
   - If Tesseract is correctly installed and the `PATH` is set, you should see the version information.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully run Tesseract from the command line.
