User: I have a python script that runs continuously in background and print some logs on standard output.
If I log with the same user on the same machine via ssh however I cannot see the output since (I guess) I opened a different shell.
Is there any way to specify that the standard output of this process must be seen by all the shell where I am logged with the same username of the one who launched the process?
Alternatively I thought of redirecting the output to a file and open this file… however I would prefer avoiding such a solution.
Thanks in advance for any suggestion…
Assistant: In UNIX you could write to all shells using the command wall. I'm not sure if there is a Python binding for wall though.
