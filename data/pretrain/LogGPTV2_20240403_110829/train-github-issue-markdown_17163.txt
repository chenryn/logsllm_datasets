The `sklearn.metrics` module includes an `isclose()` function in the `ranking.py` file, which can lead to significant debugging challenges for data practitioners who are unaware of its behavior. In highly unbalanced classification scenarios, probabilities or scores can be very small but still meaningful. However, the `isclose()` function treats values within \(10^{-6}\) as equal, leading to unexpected missing precision-recall points.

To address this issue, I recommend two improvements:
1. **Documentation Update**: Add a warning in the documentation to alert users about the potential pitfalls of using `isclose()` with small probabilities in unbalanced classification.
2. **Code Modification**: Replace the absolute epsilon value in `isclose()` with a relative closeness comparison. This change will help avoid the problems associated with small probabilities and ensure more accurate precision-recall calculations.

By implementing these changes, we can enhance the robustness and reliability of the `sklearn.metrics` module for a wider range of use cases.
