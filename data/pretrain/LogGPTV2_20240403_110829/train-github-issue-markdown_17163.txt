`sklearn.metrics` introduces `isclose()` in https://github.com/scikit-
learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py which can leave the
unaware data practitioner with hours of debugging.
In very unbalanced classification, probabilities/scores can be very small and
yet meaningful. This however will cause unexpected missing precision_recall
points due to `isclose` treating values within 10e-6 as equal.
I'd suggest to place a warning about `isclose` in the documentation and also
replace the absolute epsilon by a relative closeness comparison in order to
avoid the problems with small probabilities in unbalanced classification.
