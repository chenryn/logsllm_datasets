Rust should support a no extra attribute and flag. This would be useful for me
so I could:
  * compile my own hacked version of extra like `rustc rust/src/libextra/extra.rs --output-dir .`
  * compile a regressing benchmark like `rustc -L . -Z no-extra rust/src/test/bench/msgsend-mutex-arcs.rs -o mutex-bench`
  * and then run the benchmark file like `./mutex-bench`
This would greatly speed up time hunting for the regression in mutex
performance for my pull request #7701 .
