The Jersey City/Newark UA uses its shared ultra high frequency (UHF) channels on a weekly basis to 
provide communications interoperability and regularly deploys and uses radio caches and gateways.  The 
Jersey City/Newark UA did well with the use of available communications interoperability equipment during 
the TICP validation exercise.  Some minor training issues were encountered during the exercise; for example 
the traffic units were discussing road closures on the same shared channel that the COML was performing a 
radio check until a dispatcher intervened.  Overall, evaluators of the exercise noted that “users were 
proficient with the use of UTAC4, ITAC5, and OEM2 as shared channels” and “the gateway technician was 
proficient with the setup and use of the system.”  
Recommendations: 
• 
Recommend additional training on how to use radios and available channels 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Jersey City Police Department operates a radio system with five UHF conventional channels.  The Jersey City Fire 
Department radio system uses two UHF conventional channels.  The Newark Police Department uses a conventional 
UHF radio system, and the Newark Fire Department uses a conventional very high frequency (VHF) radio system.  
Newark Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is also operating a radio system on the VHF band.  All agencies can use 
the Essex County Sheriff’s Radio System (UHF/VHF) for interoperability.  All agencies also have access to the New 
Jersey Interoperability Communications System, which has eight 800 megahertz channels and nine VHF channels. 
Jersey City is in the process of implementing a UHF trunked radio system for police, fire, and EMS.  Estimated 
completion date is the end of calendar year 2007.  In Newark, there is the possibility of implementing an Essex County 
trunked system to cover all agencies in the county, if funding issues can be resolved.

The UA’s Interoperable Communications Committee was formed in 2006 and is taking steps to establish 
interoperability as a priority within the area.  For example, the decision-making group is formalized (with 
subcommittees devoted to technology, operations, and governance) and includes federal partners.  The group 
is working to reach out to additional public safety (e.g., emergency medical services [EMS]) and state 
agencies, as demonstrated through its partnership with the New York State Wireless Network for which 
Buffalo has been selected as the primary regional buildout.  In addition, it appears that local and county 
elected officials are promoting the Urban Area Working Group’s interoperable communications efforts (e.g., 
the Mayor of Buffalo participates on the committee).  Regional, published interoperable communications 
agreements are included in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), which is being 
disseminated to applicable agencies.  The publication of a regional strategic plan, which is under 
development, would represent the next step in advancing interoperable communications governance across 
the area.  Additional steps, including addressing a longer term funding strategy to identify diversified or 
sustainable funding sources, would help the Buffalo UA budget for the future system and additional regional 
interoperable communications needs.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to expand subcommittee and working group membership to appropriate disciplines and levels 
of government (e.g., EMS, state, and federal representation) while continuing to document and formalize 
the necessary interoperability agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) with members 
• 
Finalize and publish the existing regional strategic plan; align local and state strategic planning efforts to 
ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Continue the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) 
interoperability planning and sustainable funding 
• 
Continue to involve government leadership on issues of communications interoperability and encourage 
long-term regional funding plans

The TICP provided the first regional communications interoperability SOPs for the Buffalo UA, which 
included a majority of the local, state, and federal agencies within the area.  Although the Buffalo UA did not 
have pre-existing SOPs, the agencies within the UA were able to effectively execute the SOPs as outlined in 
the TICP.  For example, during the TICP validation exercise, the participants were able to successfully 
follow the policies and procedures to request, activate, deactivate, and resolve problems for radio caches, 
shared channels, and gateways.  Although the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident 
Command System (ICS) was only implemented in September 2006, responders demonstrated some 
proficiency in command and control during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., announced the

exercise.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure that regional SOPs are aligned with statewide planning efforts (e.g., develop SOPs for use of the 
future statewide communications system)

The participating agencies in the TICP validation exercise demonstrated the ability to successfully achieve 
communications interoperability.  During the exercise, the Buffalo UA adequately used and demonstrated all 
available means of communications (e.g., radio caches, gateways, and shared channels).  Some notable issues 
did arise during the exercise.  Buffalo officials indicate that there are designated shared channels to provide 
first responder interoperability.  However, as noted in the After Action Report, “[t]here was limited 
communication between fire and EMS during the exercise; the two agencies did not discuss their needs and 
capabilities, coordinate their resources, or relay information regarding their actions to one another.”  The 
TICP validation exercise included federal agencies (e.g., Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 
Explosives), which shows proactive effort on the part of the UA to include a broad range of response 
agencies.  The UA is encouraged to build on its local exercise success by further integrating state, federal and 
support agencies in its future events. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to exercise interoperability solutions that allows for direct communications between fire and 
EMS (as noted in the Improvement Plan) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Buffalo UA has no shared radio systems and is supported by a mixture of conventional very high frequency (VHF) 
and ultra high frequency (UHF) radio frequencies.  The Buffalo Police and Fire Departments operate separate UHF 
radio systems, and routine communications with regional law enforcement agencies is accomplished through the use of 
VHF high band frequencies. 
Erie County Fire Departments operate VHF low band and UHF radio systems; the Erie County Sheriff operates a UHF 
radio system.  In Niagara County, the Sheriff’s Office operates a VHF high band radio system, whereas other law 
enforcement agencies in the county operate on a mixture of UHF and VHF frequencies.  Niagara County Fire operates 
on both VHF low band and UHF.  Interoperability with state and other regional agencies is achieved through the use of 
shared VHF and UHF channels, fixed and mobile gateways, and cached radios.  The New York State Wireless Network 
is currently not available in the UA but is expected to be available late 2008.

Established in 2002, the New York City Interagency Communications Committee (NYCICC) is a formalized  group 
that meets regularly to evaluate current states of interoperable communications and to develop strategies to exercise and 
drill communications capabilities, raise awareness within agencies, and ensure that improvements are coordinated.  The 
group has been proactive in incorporating multiple local, regional, state, federal, and public support agencies in their 
decision-making process.  Major organizations in the UA have existing agreements in place (e.g., and New York City 
Police Department [NYPD] & New York City Fire Department [FDNY] Executive Orders), although partnerships with 
smaller agencies in the area are informal.  A strategic plan, which will incorporate counties from two additional states 
(i.e., Connecticut and New Jersey) is in development, but has not yet been adopted.  Funding for interoperable capital 
improvements is provided through federal grants and supported by local resources to meet interoperability needs (e.g., 
dispatch and maintenance).  The City of New York has prepared a four year financial plan, which should be included 
into a broader strategic plan for the region.  While the NYCICC has coordinated regional communications efforts, 
additional participation and leadership from jurisdictions throughout the area is needed to achieve regionwide 
interoperability.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure that all applicable local agencies are documented and referenced in agreements (e.g., memoranda of 
understanding, inter-governmental agreements) at a regional level 
• 
Reference all applicable agreements in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), and store them in 
an accessible format 
• 
Establish a regular review process to ensure that agreements remain current and relevant 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regionwide strategic plan (beyond the operational focus to the TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance that takes into account a long-term communications funding strategy 
(in addition to grants) 
• 
Align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Develop a funding strategy for identifying sustainable funding sources (in addition to grants) to cover lifecycle and 
recurring costs of the UA’s communications interoperability assets

The New York TICP is based on various existing policies and procedures (e.g., the New York Metropolitan Area 
Committee’s Spectrum Relief for Interoperability Channels Memorandum).  These SOPs were expanded to include both 
new procedures and additional jurisdictions in the area.  The New York UA has taken steps to disseminate these policies 
to necessary agencies and their dispatch centers.  Officials in New York City recognize that “ongoing training and 
exercises will only strengthen first responder awareness… and further advance the current SOPs based upon actual 
usage.”  New York City uses Citywide Incident Management System (CIMS) for command and control Incident 
Command System (ICS) implementation, whereas the rest of the UA implemented the National Incident Management

System (NIMS).  TICP peer reviewers noted that consistency in ICS needs to be clearly articulated to ensure smooth 
integration of first responders from outside the city who are trained on NIMS procedures.  CIMS has been certified as 
compliant with NIMS as both use the same ICS terminology, positions, and roles for first responders.  However, 
agencies throughout the area still refer to CIMS and NIMS separately.  It is therefore unclear if there is regionwide 
understanding that these command structures can be seamlessly integrated during a response.  The limited scope of the 
TICP validation exercise did not provide the opportunity to see all aspects of this interaction.  However, the procedures 
for command and control that were tested during the exercise were successfully demonstrated.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to distribute updated regional communications interoperability SOPs (e.g., document demonstrated 
exercise procedures not originally included in the TICP)  
• 
Develop training policies and requirements for inclusion in the TICP 
• 
Ensure that the same command structure is used throughout the area (e.g., ensure CIMS and NIMS are consistently 
applied and practiced across the area)

New York City has developed multiple means of providing interoperable communications.  As noted by exercise 
evaluators, FDNY and NYPD command “are now using the same radios on the same frequency band, which is a 
commendable development.”  Nassau County has a New York City operational frequency, and New York City and 
Suffolk County also share channels.  New York City provides a common channel for coordination and interoperable 
communications among city agencies, as well as other agencies entering the city, to accomplish public safety missions.  
The exercise evaluators also noted a weekly roll call of Federal agencies using the Federal Interoperability Gateway-
based System, which is commendable.  Due to the limited scope of the exercise , which did not fully stress the 
communications capabilities of the UA, it is difficult to determine the level of local, regional, state, and federal 
participation in local response incidents.  Officials in New York City indicate that they “have to do exercises more with 
[their] surrounding neighbors.  These exercises need to be more robust.”  The exercise did not include any public 
support agencies (e.g., public health, utilities), and prevented adequate testing of interoperable communications (e.g., 
evaluators not given access to dispatch center to observe activation of a console patch).    
Recommendations: 
• 
Conduct robust exercises to test interoperable communications capabilities (e.g., more complexity, additional local, 
regional, state, and federal agencies) 
• 
Consider adding interoperable communications as an evaluation component for all future exercises and day-to-day 
activities

New York City UA has developed multiple means of providing interoperable communications.  Command and control 
interoperability is provided by a Regional Wide-Area Interoperability system that is expanding into New Jersey and into 
Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester counties.  An 800 megahertz (MHz) trunked system has dedicated command and 
control talk-groups, such as ALERT, to provide high-level, interoperable communications for city, state and regional 
agencies.  Within the UA, operational interoperability is provided by NYPD zone frequencies; tactical interoperability 
uses a common UHF point-to-point channel.  The counties operate 800 MHz, ultra high frequency, and very high 
frequency systems providing interoperability to their public safety agencies.  The UA also employs a variety of national 
law enforcement, New York State Police Mutual Rapid Deployment and National Public Safety Planning Advisory 
Committee mutual aid channels, which are accessible throughout the region.  The Federal Interoperability Channel 
provides most federal agencies interoperability to local, regional, and state agencies throughout the UA and northeastern 
New Jersey as well.

Coordination for communications in the Charlotte UA is provided by the PACC, which is working to 
establish communications interoperability as a regional priority.  The PACC has been in place since 2003 
addressing key communications interoperability issues, including the development of a multi-agency 
Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) project.  The PACC has 
established formal partnerships among the 11 counties (in 2 states) that represent the Charlotte UA, and they 
are expanding to include public health and public works.  In addition, the Charlotte Regional 
Communications Council (RCC) is established and in place for those agencies participating in the UA’s 
shared system.  However, as Charlotte officials indicated, the agreements have not yet been put into practice 
across the entire UA.  Based on the activities of the governance group, it appears that regional leaders have 
made communications interoperability a priority (e.g., the UA has planned interoperability training for 
participating agencies).  Despite this apparent prioritization of interoperable communications in the 
governance groups, no long-term strategic plan (including funding strategies) is in place.  While agencies are 
considering regional interoperability needs, it appears that agencies still focus the use of grant funding on 
their individual, specific communications needs.  This issue would be best addressed by developing a 
strategic plan that includes a longer term funding strategy to obtain diversifiable and sustainable funding for 
regionwide interoperable communications solutions. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Proactively recruit new PACC participants, including federal agencies  
• 
Encourage planning and development of strategic plan (i.e., longer term collective goals for the UA) 
(beyond the operational focus of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan [TICP]) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance; align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure 
that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Pursue a regional communications interoperability funding plan as a component of this strategy, 
including long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) funding sources (in addition to grants)
