These Hashtags: This option will locate specific posts that mention a topic as defined by a Twitter hashtag. 
This is a single word preceded by a pound sign (#) that identifies a topic of interest This allows users to follow 
certain topics without knowing usernames of the user submitting the messages.
Twitter is a social network and microblogging service that limits most posts to 280 characters. In 2019, Twitter 
reported that there were over 500 million Twitter posts, or "Tweets", posted every day. Basically, users create a 
profile and post Tweets announcing their thoughts on a topic, current location, plans for the evening, or maybe 
a link to something that they feel is important. A user can "follow" other users and constandy see what others 
are posting. Likewise, a user's "followers" can see what that user is up to on a constant basis. The premise is 
simply sharing small details of your life for all of your friends to see, as well as the rest of the world. Most people 
utilize the service through a mobile app within a cellular phone. Obtaining information from Twitter can be 
conducted through numerous procedures, all of which are explained here. Similar to Facebook, we will start 
with official search options through Twitter's website. Unlike Facebook, you do not need to be logged in to 
their service in order to conduct queries on their website.
From these accounts: This section allows you to search for Tweets from a specific user. This can also be 
accomplished by typing the username into the address bar after the Twitter domain, such as 
twitter.com/JohnDoe92. This will display the user's profile including recent Tweets.
This is the official site's search interface, but it is nothing different than the search field at the top of any Twitter 
profile or search result. I only present this because navigating to twitter.com often offers a signup page, but nr 
option to search. We will use this standard search bar to conduct specific queries in a few moments.

This page will allow for the search of specific people, keywords, and locations. The problem here is that the 
search of a topic is often limited to the previous seven to ten days. Individual profiles should display Tweets as 
far back as you are willing to scroll. This can be a good place to search for recent data, but complete archives of 
a topic will not be displayed. The following explains each section.
Any of these words: You can provide multiple unique terms here, and Twitter will supply results that include 
any of them. This search alone is usually too generic.

to a specific date range. We will do this manually in just a
Overall, I do not ever use the Twitter Advanced Search page. You can replicate all of these queries with manual 
search operators within the search field available on every Twitter page. I will explain each as we go through the 
chapter. Knowing the Twitter search operators instead of relying on the advanced search page has many benefits. 
First, we can use these techniques to monitor live Twitter data, as explained later in this chapter. Next, manual 
searches allow us to better document our findings. This is vital if your discoveries will be used in court.
Top: This displays popular tweets matching your query. If your target is popular, you may see something here. 
I typically avoid this tab as it allows Twitter to determine what evidence I should see instead of selecting content 
based on specific queries.
Locating your target's Twitter profile may not be easy. Unlike Facebook, many Twitter users do not use their 
real name in their profiles. You need a place to search by real name. I recommend Twitter's official search page 
before relying on third parties. After searching any real name or username within the standard Twitter search 
field, click through the five menu options, which are each explained below.
Latest: This presents a reverse-chronological list of data which matches your search. It always begins with the 
most recent post and goes backward. This works well when searching a topic, but not when locating a target's 
profile.
Twitter data can be used for many types of investigations. Law enforcement may use this data to verify or 
disprove an alibi of a suspect. When a suspect states in an interview that he was in Chicago the entire weekend, 
but his Twitter feed displays his Tweet about a restaurant in St Louis, he has some explaining to do. Private 
investigators may use this content as documentation of an affair or negative character. Occasionally, a citizen 
will contact the authorities when evidence of illegal activity is found within a person's Tweets. The possibilities 
are endless. First, let's find your target's Twitter profile.
Mentioning these accounts: While these messages might not be in response to a specific user, the target was 
mentioned. This is usually in the form of using Anyone mentioning me within a Tweet may start it with 
@inteltechniques.
People: Scrolling through this list allows you to look through the photo icons and brief descriptions to identify 
your target. Clicking on the username will open the user's Twitter profile with more information. This is the 
best option for searching by real name or username.
Later in the chapter, w'C will combine all of our new techniques within our own custom tool options, which will 
be much more powerful than these standard solutions. The results of any of these searches can provide 
surprisingly personal information about a target, or generic content that includes too much data to be useful. 
We must learn each technique within a specific order before we can combine them into powerful queries.

Search by Email Address

Suggestions for you to 
follow
When you follow someone, you'll see their Tweets in 
your Home Timeline.
Enabling this feature will not display your contacts within die application. Instead, look at your notification bar 
within Android. You should see a pending notification which states "Find your friends on Twitter". Clicking 
this should present the "Suggested Followers" screen as seen in Figure 11.01. In this example, I entered the 
personal email address of Chris Hadnagy into my Android contacts. This immediately identified him as a 
"Friend" and Twitter encouraged me to add him. I now know that he associated his personal email address with 
this Twitter account. Twitter will encourage you to add these profiles, but do not choose that option. If you do, 
your target will be sent a notification from your account.
W ithin Android, open the Contacts application and add the email address of your target within a new contact 
and save the entry. Open the Twitter app, navigate to the left menu and select "Settings and privacy", click on 
"Privacy and safety", then "Discoverability and contacts". You can then manage your data and allow Twitter to 
sync your Android contacts to their sendee.
If searching by real name through the previous methods does not produce your target, your best option is to 
focus on the potential username. I will discuss username searches at length in a later chapter (Usernames). 
Overall, any associated usernames from other networks such as Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube, should be 
tried on Twitter in the format of twitter.com/username.

If you still cannot locate your target's profile, you may need to resort to the Twitter Directory. This awkward 
and difficult monstrosity tries to allow you to browse through the millions of Twitter profiles alphabetically. 
First, choose the first letter of the first name of your target. This will present a range of options. You then need 
to select the range in which your target would be listed, and that selection would open a new window with 
hundreds of name range options such as "Mike Hall - Mike Hirsch". You will need to keep using this drill down 
method unul you reach a list of actual profiles that meet your criteria. I do not enjoy this method, but sometimes 
it is all that 1 have. 1 once found my target this way after he used a misspelled version of his real name.
Technically, Twitter docs not allow the search of a username by providing an email address. If you attempt this 
type of search on Twitter, you will receive no results, even if a profile exists for a user with that email address. 
To bypass this limitation, you can use a feature offered within the mobile app version of Twitter. This technique 
will require a new Twitter account and the Twitter app present within a virtual Android device, as previously 
explained. This could also be replicated on a physical mobile device, but that is not recommended.

We can also filter by replies with the following search. This would only display the tweets from our target which

Similar to the way that search engines use operators as mentioned in previous chapters, Twitter has its own set 
of search operators that will greatly improve your ability to effectively search Twitter. Two of the most powerful 
options are the "to" and "from" operators. I use these daily in order to filter results. Consider the following 
examples using our target Twitter username of twitter.com/sultryasian. We can obviously navigate directly to 
her page, but it is full of promoted Tweets, ReTweets, and whatever content she wants us to see. Instead, the 
following search within any Twitter window’ will limit our results only to her outgoing Tweets from her account. 
Clicking die "Latest" option in the Twitter menu will place these in reverse-chronological order.
This provides a better view’ into her thoughts. Both her Twitter profile and this results page give us insight to 
the messages she is sending out, but what about the incoming content? With most traditional Twitter 
investigations, we tend to focus on one side of die conversation. There is often a plethora of associated messages 
being sent to the attention of the target that go unchecked. In order to see all of the posts being publicly sent to 
her, we would search die following.
I do not find this very helpful. I prefer the opposite of this approach. The following search within Twitter would 
display only the tweets by my target which do NOT include replies.
There are no spaces in this search. This will be a list without any map view. They will be in order chronologically 
with the most recent at top. The "1km" indicates a search radius of one kilometer. This can be changed to 5,10, 
or 25 reliably. Any other numbers tend to provide inaccurate results. You can also change "km" to "mi" to 
switch to miles instead of kilometers. If you want to view’ this search from the address bar of the browser, the 
following page would load the same results.
We now’ see all of those incoming messages that she cannot control. While she can prohibit them from being 
seen on her profile, she cannot block us from this search. When I have a missing person or homicide victim, I 
W’ould much rather see the incoming messages versus the outgoing. We can also combine these options to create 
an extremely targeted query. At first glance, I did not see many incoming messages to SultryAsian from 
HydeNS33k. How’ever, the following Twitter search tells a different story’. It isolates only’ these posts.
If you are investigating an incident that occurred at a specific location and you have no known people involved, 
Twitter will allow’ you to search by’ GPS location alone. The Twitter Advanced Search allowed us to search by 
zip code, but that can be too broad. The following specific search on any’ Twitter page will display' Tweets known 
to have been posted from within one kilometer of the GPS coordinates of 43.430242,-89.736459.
https://twitter.com/search?q=geocode:43.430242,-89.736459,1 km
geocode:43.430242,-89.736459,1km "fight"
Mandatory and Optional Search Terms

Date Range Search

from:humanhacker since:2012-01-01 until:2012-12-31
This may create a more digestible collection of Tweets that can be collected and archived appropriately. There 
may be no other way of identifying these messages since you cannot likely scroll back that far. In my 
investigations involving targets with several thousand posts, I conduct multiple searches within Twitter that span 
several years. The following would collect yearly sets of Tweets posted by humanhacker since 2006.
My favorite use of this search technique is to combine it with the "to" operator or a name search (or both). This 
allows you to go further back in time than standard profile and Twitter feed searches typically allow. Consider 
an example where Twitter user humanhacker is your target. You can visit his live Twitter page and navigate back 
through several thousand Tweets. However, you will reach an end before obtaining all Tweets. This could be 
due to Twitter restrictions or browser and computer limitations. He currently has 13,000 Tweets. Even if you 
could make it through all of his Tweets, you are not seeing posts where he is mentioned or messages sent publicly 
to him. 1 recommend splitting this search by year and including mentions and messages directed toward him. 
The following search within Twitter displays all Tweets from the Twitter name humanhacker between January 
1,2012 and December 31, 2012.
If you are searching vague terms, you may want to filter by date. This option is now available on the advanced 
search page, but I believe it is important to understand how Twitter performs this task. Assume that you are 
investigating a bomb threat that occurred several weeks or months ago. A search on Twitter of the terms "bomb 
threat" will likely apply only to recent posts. Instead, consider a date specific search. The following query on any 
Twitter page would provide any posts that mention "bomb threat" between J anuary 1,2015 and January 5,2015.
You can add search parameters to either of these searches if the results are overwhelming. The following search 
would only display Tweets posted at the listed GPS coordinates that also mention the term "fight". Notice that 
the only space in the search is between "km" and "fight".
You may have a scenario that requires a search of both mandatory and optional terms. Twitter does not provide 
a published solution for this. However, it does support this type of search. Assume you are investigating threats 
against your target named Michael Parker. You believe that people may be tweeting about him with reference 
to violence. Searching his name alone produces too many results. Placing the name within quotes forces Twitter 
to only give you results on those exact terms, which is your "mandatory" portion. Additional optional words 
could be added with the term "OR" is between each. This term must be uppercase, and will only require one of 
the optional words be present within the search results. Consider the following query on Twitter.
It would be inappropriate to finish this section without a discussion about the lack of geo-enabled Tweets. 
Several years prior, this search would have been highly productive, as an alarming number of Twitter users were 
unknowingly sharing their locations with every post. Today, it is the opposite. The default option for Twitter is 
NOT to share location. A user must enable this option in order to appear within these search results. In my 
experience, catching a criminal from a location-enabled Tweet is extremely rare. However, we should be aware 
of the possibility.

This isolates only his posts from the beginning of Twitter until the end of 2009. Only four results are present, 
including the Tweet as seen in Figure 11.02 (top). We will use this data during our automation process as 
discussed later (sorry Chris). These queries do not need to encompass an entire year. You could use this 
technique to focus on a specific month or day. Figure 11.02 (bottom) tells me what Chris was up to on October 
2, 2017 with the following query.
There are many uses for a date range search. Any supported Twitter search should work combined with dates. 
This might include a location search for a specific date related to an investigation. As a test of the possibilities, 
consider that you want to identify an email address for this target. His live Twitter page will not reveal this, as 
he no longer posts his email, likely to prevent spam. However, the following search is quite productive.

We can also filter for popular posts. The following searches for any tweets from my own account which received 
at least 150 likes.

video, or website. The following presents only tweets with links from my own account
If 1 encounter a Twitter user that has recently deleted some or all of their messages, I conduct a cache search of 
their profile. There are various ways to do this, and I will demonstrate the most common. In this example, 1 
conducted a search on Twitter for "deleted all my Tweets" on December 15, 2017. This provided many users 
who posted that they had just deleted all of their content. This helped me identify a good target for this type of
You may want to filter all results from a target Twitter profile and only see those which have some type of media 
embedded. There is not a search operator to force this, but the following direct URL will display only these 
posts.
Twitter users may delete their own accounts if there is suspicion that an investigation is under way. If this 
happens, searching on Twitter will not display any of the posts. Furthermore, a person might only delete 
individual Twitter posts that are incriminating, but leave non-interesting posts on the profile to prevent raising 
suspicion associated with deleting an entire account. Some users may find their accounts suspended for violating 
Twitter's terms of service. In any of these scenarios, it is still possible to retrieve some missing posts using 
various techniques.
Now, let's combine a few searches. The following query’ would identify any tweets sent to our target, from his 
daughter, during the month of March of 2018, which included a link, and were replies from another post.
Replicating this search reveals only one result, which may have been otherwise buried within the thousands of 
posts. Hopefully you can see the value of targeted queries. Later in the chapter, I present the custom offline 
Twitter search tools which automate most of these queries. However, it is vital to understand why these work 
in order to explain your methods when required.
A trend that has seen rapid adoption over the past few years is the "Liking" of posts. When a user wants to 
acknowledge something said by another user, but does not necessarily want to respond or ReTweet, clicking the 
small heart icon indicates that the post was "liked". The following direct URL displays all of the posts that our 
target liked. For unknown reasons, this query requires you to be logged in to an account.
