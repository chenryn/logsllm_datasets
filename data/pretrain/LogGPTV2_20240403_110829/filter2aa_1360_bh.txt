### Chapter Eleven: Social Networks - Twitter

#### Introduction to Twitter
Twitter is a social networking and microblogging platform that limits most posts, or "Tweets," to 280 characters. In 2019, Twitter reported over 500 million Tweets posted daily. Users create profiles and share their thoughts, current locations, plans, or links to content they find important. Users can "follow" others to see their posts, and their followers can see their updates. The core idea is to share small details of one's life with friends and the broader public. Most users access Twitter via a mobile app on their smartphones.

#### Searching on Twitter
To obtain information from Twitter, you can use various methods, starting with the official search options on Twitter's website. Unlike Facebook, you do not need to be logged in to conduct searches on Twitter.

- **Hashtags**: Hashtags (e.g., #topic) allow you to find specific posts related to a topic. This enables users to follow topics without needing to know the usernames of those posting.
- **From These Accounts**: You can search for Tweets from a specific user by typing their username into the address bar after the Twitter domain (e.g., twitter.com/JohnDoe92). This displays the user's profile and recent Tweets.
- **Any of These Words**: You can enter multiple unique terms, and Twitter will return results that include any of them. This search alone is often too broad.
- **Dates**: You can limit your search to a specific date range. We will cover this in more detail later.
- **Videos and Photos**: You can search for videos and photos matching your query, which can be useful for identifying images posted by unknown people who mention your target.
- **Top**: This tab displays popular Tweets matching your query. It is less useful for specific queries as it allows Twitter to determine the content.
- **Latest**: This presents a reverse-chronological list of data, starting with the most recent post. It is useful for tracking a topic but less so for finding a specific profile.

#### Advanced Search Techniques
While Twitter offers an advanced search page, I prefer using manual search operators within the standard search field. This approach allows for more precise and flexible searches, which can be crucial for investigations.

- **Mentioning These Accounts**: This option finds Tweets where a specific user is mentioned, even if the message is not a direct reply.
- **People**: Scrolling through this list helps identify your target by looking at photo icons and brief descriptions. Clicking on the username opens the user's profile with more information.
- **Combining Techniques**: Later in the chapter, we will combine these techniques into custom tools for more powerful queries.

#### Locating a Target's Profile
Finding a target's Twitter profile can be challenging, as many users do not use their real names. Here are some methods:

- **Real Name Search**: Use Twitter's official search page to search by real name or username.
- **Username Search**: If searching by real name fails, try potential usernames from other networks (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube).
- **Twitter Directory**: As a last resort, use the Twitter Directory to browse through profiles alphabetically. This method is cumbersome but sometimes necessary.

#### Using Email Addresses
Twitter does not officially allow searching by email address, but you can use a feature in the mobile app to bypass this limitation. This requires a new Twitter account and the Twitter app on a virtual Android device.

- **Add Contact**: Add the target's email address to your Android contacts and sync them with Twitter. This will suggest the target's profile to you.

#### Search Operators
Twitter has a set of search operators that can enhance your search capabilities. Here are some examples:

- **from:username**: Limits results to Tweets from a specific user.
- **to:username**: Shows Tweets directed at a specific user.
- **filter:replies**: Filters Tweets to show only replies.
- **-filter:replies**: Excludes replies from the search results.
- **geocode:latitude,longitude,radius**: Searches for Tweets within a specified geographic area.
- **since:date until:date**: Limits results to a specific date range.
- **"exact phrase" OR term**: Combines mandatory and optional terms in a search.

#### Example Queries
- **Outgoing Tweets**: `from:SultryAsian` shows all outgoing Tweets from the user.
- **Incoming Tweets**: `to:SultryAsian` shows all incoming Tweets to the user.
- **Non-Replies**: `from:SultryAsian -filter:replies` shows outgoing Tweets that are not replies.
- **Location-Based Search**: `geocode:43.430242,-89.736459,1km` finds Tweets from within a 1-kilometer radius of the specified coordinates.
- **Date Range Search**: `since:2015-01-01 until:2015-01-05 "bomb threat"` finds Tweets mentioning "bomb threat" within the specified date range.
- **Combining Operators**: `to:humanhacker from:AimsandShoot since:2018-03-01 until:2018-03-31 filter:links -filter:replies` finds Tweets sent to humanhacker from AimsandShoot in March 2018 that include links and are not replies.

#### Media, Likes, and Links
- **Media**: `https://twitter.com/humanhacker/media/` displays Tweets with media.
- **Likes**: `https://twitter.com/humanhacker/likes/` shows Tweets liked by the user.
- **Links**: `from:inteltechniques filter:links` finds Tweets from inteltechniques that include links.
- **Popular Posts**: `from:inteltechniques min_faves:150` finds Tweets from inteltechniques with at least 150 likes.
- **Replies**: `from:inteltechniques min_replies:100` finds Tweets from inteltechniques with at least 100 replies.

#### Handling Deleted, Suspended, and Missing Tweets
- **Cache Search**: Use Google, Bing, or Yandex to find cached versions of deleted Tweets.
- **Site-Specific Search**: `site:twitter.com/westcornfield/status` finds direct links to Tweets from a specific user.

By understanding and utilizing these techniques, you can effectively gather and analyze Twitter data for various investigative purposes.
