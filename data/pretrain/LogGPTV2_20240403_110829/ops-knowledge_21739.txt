User: I'm working on the default python interpreter on Mac OS X, and I Cmd+K (cleared) my earlier commands. I can go through them one by one using the arrow keys. But is there an option like the --history option in bash shell, which shows you all the commands you've entered so far?
Assistant: With python 3 interpreter the history is written to
~/.python_history
