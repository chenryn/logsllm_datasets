graphic schemes for ultra-high-speed and ultra-security. Our
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-
art key management architecture, FORTIS, COMA is able to
reduce the area overhead by 14%, while addressing many of
the shortcomings of the previous work.
Figure 9: Energy Breakdown in COMA.
key for communication and authentication is generated by
PUF, when FORTIS relies on embedding the private key and
public key in GDSII. So, the private key in FORTIS will
be known to the fabrication posing the risk that the entire
process of activation could be faked in software. In COMA,
such attack is prevented as secret key is generated by PUF
and is securely read out using public key cryptography. 3) In
FORTIS, the usage of the private key for chip authentication
is vulnerable to SCA. In COMA, the secret-key cryptography
is side channel protected, and the public-key encryption is
only used once, making COMA secure against SCA. 4) In
FORTIS, there is also the possibility of deploying a fault
attack by ﬁxing the value of session key Ks. In COMA, the
same attack would require ﬁxing the PUF output or replacing
the PUF with a known function. This however could be tested
by reading out the output of the PUF using multiple challenges
and performing statistical test on the PUF response (PUF
health check). 5) In FORTIS, the activation is done once,
hence there is a need to store the obfuscation key in the
untrusted chip. In COMA, the need to store the obfuscation
key in untrusted chip is removed. In R-COMA, the activation
takes place on demand, and the key is removed after power
down or reset. In 2.5D-COMA, the activation key is stored
in a trusted chip. 6) COMA provides two new mechanisms
for communication: a) the DCC mode for added security, and
b) the LCC mode for high-speed communication. 7) COMA
uses a TRNG to produce the seed for PRNG, while FORTIS
uses a PRNG without addressing a random source for its seed,
increasing its vulnerability.
