the frequency of the system will be affected. A frequency pro-
tection relay would disconnect a generator from the system
if the frequency of the system stays lower or higher than the
generator’s threshold values for too long in order to prevent
permanent damage to the generator. Figure 6 shows the fre-
quency responses to the 15% load increase. We can see that
the system frequency starts to decline after the attack starts
(the attack starts after one second). The frequency relays then
disconnect all the generators in the system two seconds after
the frequency drops below the threshold of 58 Hz (table 2).
Therefore, this results in a blackout in the transient simulation
of the IoT demand attack. These transient stability results
are different from the steady state stability study, which iden-
tifyied only one cascading line outage as discussed in the
previous paragraph.
This is a motivating reason to include transient and steady
state analysis together in a single simulation. Because tran-
sient and steady-state simulations are connected in a closed

frequency stops decreasing and starts to stabilize to its desired
state. The system frequency reaches a new stable state and
there are no generator disconnections from the system.

tween bus 7 and bus 8 in the transient simulation
What is more, because of UFLS, the system load is re-
duced to a level where no transmission line is overloaded,
and therefore there are no cascading outages. In Figure 8, we
can see that the transmission line between bus 7 and bus 8 in
Figure 4 is overloaded after the IoT demand increase attack
begins at one second. However, the power ﬂow on the line
soon decreases following the load shedding event caused by
UFLS and remains below its rated capacity at the end of the
transient simulation. As discussed in Section 4.1, a power
ﬂow steady state simulation starts based on the solution of
the transient simulation; the results of this new steady state
stability analysis are shown in Figure 9. We can see that no
line is overloaded and the combined transient and steady-state
simulations end.
The example in this subsection shows that the simulation
results will be signiﬁcantly affected if UFLS protections are
considered. In fact, by including UFLS, the closed-loop tran-
sient and steady state simulations used in this work generates
a result suggesting that the system would shed some demand,
but all the system transmission lines and generators will re-
main in operation. This result is different from the cascading
line outage suggested by our steady-state simulation illus-
trated in Figure 5 and the complete system blackout suggested
by previous work.

loop in our model, the transient solution at the end of the
simulation time will be used as an initial condition for the
steady-state power ﬂow simulation. In this example, if the
under frequency load shedding is not considered, which will
be discussed in Section 4.2, the transient solution would in-
clude the fact that all three generators were disconnected from
the system. Thus, the power ﬂow solution would indicate a
system blackout.
4.2 Under Frequency Load Shedding
Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) is a countermeasure
applied by bulk power system operators [5] to reduce the
incidence of generator under-frequency tripping, which is a
great danger to the reliable operation of the power systems.
UFLS is a coordinated disconnection of small and non-critical
(e.g., no Hospitals are ever disconnected) loads to prevent a
large blackout.
To illustrate why it is important to consider UFLS in the
simulation of IoT demand attacks, let us ﬁrst take a second
look at Figure 6. As observed, after the 15% load increase
attack, the system frequency starts to decrease. Because there
is no action that could relieve the imbalance between the in-
creased load and unchanged generation, the system frequency
declines fast until it drops below the thresholds of frequency
protections at generators. Because the frequency stays below
the thresholds for longer than the delay time set at the fre-
quency protections, the generators are disconnected and there
is a system blackout.
Now, let us compare the simulation results when we incor-
porate UFLS as deﬁned by the parameters in Table 3. Figure
7 shows the frequency response to the 15% system demand
increase attack on the WSCC 9-bus system. The system fre-
quency declines after the IoT load increase attack starts at one
second of the simulation time. The frequency of the system
then reaches the ﬁrst UFLS threshold at 59.3 Hz, and as a
result, 5% of the system load is disconnected. However, this
is not enough and the system frequency keeps declining until
it reaches the second threshold: 58.9 Hz, and at that time a
total of 15% of the system demand is disconnected and the

frequencies and therefore the system becomes a set of islands
operating semi-independently.
4.4 Line Overloads
The line overload outage models also play an important role
in understanding the impact of MadIoT attacks. Previous
work [47] relied on the criteria described by Cetinay et al. [20],
where a line will be removed from the system if the steady-
state results indicate that the power ﬂow on the line is greater
than its rated capacity. When a transmission line is overloaded,
the heat generated from the extra power ﬂow on the line will
sag the transmission line. Although it exposes the line to a
possible outage from faults associated with ground element or
vegetation, it does not necessarily cause any immediate real
danger to the system. In fact, under an emergency, the system
operator is allowed to use overloaded transmission lines for
additional transmission capacity [6]. Therefore, instead of im-
mediately removing the overloaded lines, we utilize a model
that calculates the time of tripping given the overload level.
The details are described in Section 3.3. The time inverse
calculation in the outage protection mechanism will result in
a quick tripping time for the lines that are heavily overloaded.
In this way, we approximate the different actions taken at
different levels of overload on transmission lines.
IoT Demand Attacks
4.5
In addition to ﬁxed demand increase (or decrease) attacks,
we also consider attacks that increase and then decrease the
load. The intuition for this attack is that the ﬁrst part of the
attack will force automatic responses from the grid (such as
UFLS) and therefore when the system starts operating with
a reduced load, a reversal in the load (a big decrease) can
drive the system to a potentially unstable state. After initial
attack increasing the demand, the attackers will decrease the
demand when they think the system frequency reverses due
to UFLS and intend to overshoot the system frequency over
the thresholds of generator frequency protections in the hopes
of causing a generator disconnection.
This demand increase and decrease attack was studied by
Dabrowski et al. [24]. However, our results will differ because
of their simpliﬁcation of the frequency model, as discussed in
Section 4.3. In addition, if the attacker can cyclically increase
and then decrease demand, it is reasonable to assume that the
attacker is capable of repeating this attack. The simulation
results and detailed discussions of the experiments are shown
in Section 5.
5 Simulation Results in a Large Power System
The study case we use to analyze the impact of the IoT de-
mand attacks is a large North American regional system with
more than 5,000 buses, and as such it is the largest study
Figure 9: Power ﬂow results after the transient simulation
with UFLS.
4.3 Frequency Response Model
UFLS protections are indeed considered in some previous
work [24]. However, the simpliﬁed frequency response model
used by the authors is not a good ﬁt to analyze IoT demand
attacks. The system frequency responses used by Dabrowki
et. al [24] model the power grid as a single large machine that
represents an “aggregation” of all the synchronous generators
in the system.
A synchronous machine is associated with a rotating mag-
netic ﬁeld winding that induces alternating voltages in a ar-
mature windings of the stator. The frequency of the induced
alternating voltages and of the resulting currents that ﬂow in
the stator windings when a load is connected depends on the
speed of the rotor. The frequency of the stator electrical quan-
tities is thus synchronized with the rotor mechanical speed,
hence the designation “synchronous machine” [37]. When
two or more synchronous machines are interconnected, the
stator voltages and currents of all the machines must have
the same frequency and the rotor mechanical speed of each
is synchronized to this frequency. Therefore, the rotors of all
interconnected synchronous machines must be in “synchro-
nism” [37].
In contrast, the assumption of Dabrowski et. al [24] is that
every generator in the system will respond to a disturbance ex-
actly the same. In other words, the implicit assumption of this
model is that all the generators in the system will always keep
synchronism and respond identically. However, when the sys-
tem is under a signiﬁcant disturbance, generators will respond
differently to the disturbance and the system will have the risk
of losing synchronism in a short time after the disturbance.
In some scenarios, the frequency protections will contribute
to a lack of synchronism, and therefore, the frequencies at
different buses will diverge from synchronism. All of this
frequency diversity can not be reﬂected in the single machine
mode [24]. A detailed discussion of why this phenomenon is
important will be demonstrated in subsection 5.4, where we
show how different parts of the grid start operating at different

done on the impact of IoT attacks on power systems. Unfor-
tunately, because our close collaboration with the operator of
this power systems we are required to maintain the conﬁden-
tiality of this system and we are not allowed to share the name
of the system or details of their network topology. Before we
describe our simulation results we clarify our assumptions.
5.1 Assumptions
We state three main assumptions about an IoT demand attack:
1. IoT attackers have full and unlimited ability to control
the compromised portion of loads;
2. The actions of attackers to increase or decrease the com-
promised loads are simultaneous;
3. The portion of the system demand compromised by the
cyber attackers are evenly distributed at each demand
connection point in the transmission system.
The third assumption is a speculation about the scalability
of an IoT attack. For example, if the adversary is able to com-
promise one brand of air conditioner, they can systematically
apply the attack to as many air conditioners as possible in the
target system. Thus, if the total energy capacity of all such
air conditioners is 10% of the system demand, this 10% of
demand is likely to be spread to every demand connection
point in the transmission system.
5.1.1 Parameters Used for Protection Equipment
There are two protections implemented in the transient sim-
ulation, namely Over/Under Frequency Generator Tripping
(O/UFGT) and Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS). If
the frequency at a bus deviates from a predeﬁned threshold
for more than a speciﬁc time period, the generator connected
to that bus will be tripped, and a certain percentage of load
connected to the bus will be shed. The details of O/UFGT and
UFLS are shown in Table 2 and Table 3 speciﬁcally.
Since the current and voltage responses in the system are
normally slower than frequency responses, the Time Inverse
Overload, Time Inverse Under Voltage Load Shedding, and
Time Inverse Over Voltage Generator Tripping are modeled

in the steady state simulation. Each protection checker will
calculate tripping times once the current ﬂow on branches
or the voltage at buses exceed the thresholds. The element
(branch, generator, or load) with the shortest tripping time
will be tripped as the initial conditions for the next iteration
of transient simulation. The parameters of the steady state
protection models described in equations (1-3) are listed in
Table 4.

5.2 Demand Increase Attacks
The most intuitive MadIoT attack against the power grid is a
sudden increase of demand. This will attempt to overload the
transmission lines and potentially cause cascading failures.
5.2.1
1% Demand Increase Attack
Previous work showed that a 1% increase attack against the
Polish power grid in 2008 caused cascading failures. In their
system, a 1% load increase corresponded to 210MW, requir-
ing the adversary to compromise about 210,000 air condition-
ers. In our system, one percent of the load is equivalent to
822.7 MW, which would require the attacker to compromise
approximately 822,000 air conditioners.
Figure 10 shows the bus frequency responses after 1% of
load increase at second 1 and Figure 11 shows the power ﬂow
on branches as a percent of the branch rated capacity. We can
observe that the bus frequencies shown in Figure 10, decline
after the attack at second 1 except for very few buses that are
connected to the region outside of the system with DC tie
lines (the ones that remain at 60Hz on top of the diagram) and
thereby remain less affected.
The rest of the frequencies decline from 60 Hz to 59.875
Hz in about 9 seconds and settle to a new stable state towards
the end of the transient simulation. As indicated in table 2 and
table 3, the system frequency doesn’t violate any thresholds of

frequency protections on generators and loads. Notice that we
focus our study in a short time window, since 30 seconds of
transient simulation is enough to display the moving trends of
the frequency in this case. In short, we can see the how the fre-
quency is affected after the attack; however, as long as the bus
frequency converges to a stable level, driving the frequency
back to 60Hz can be accomplished either automatically or
manually over a longer time scale.
In summary, a 1% load increase attack does not affect our
system and there is no need to activate any protection equip-
ment as the transmission lines remain operating in their nom-
inal values and the frequency of the system does not reach
thresholds to activate any protection.
In contrast to our results, Soltan et al. [47] ﬁnd that with a
1% increase in load there could be cascading outages in the
summer peak of the Polish grid. We are surprised that a sudden
1% increase in load can lead to cascades in a power system.
The reason for our surprise is the N-1 security criterion.
The N-1 criterion requires that electricity systems be op-
erated to be able to withstand sudden step changes in the
supply-demand balance due to outages of generation. The
NERC disturbance control performance standard [8] requires
any system to be able to withstand “the most severe single
contingency” which may include certain common-model dou-
ble outages. For ERCOT, for example, (the Power Grid of
Texas) this amounts to always having 2700 MW or more of
reserves to cope with a simultaneous outage of nuclear units
having total production of around 2700 MW. To put that in
