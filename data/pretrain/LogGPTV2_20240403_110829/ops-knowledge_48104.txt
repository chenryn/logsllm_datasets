User: How to configure and use NAT (Network Address Translation) to enable hosts in the LAN to access the Internet?
Assistant: The following are the steps to configure and use NAT to enable hosts in the LAN to access the Internet: 1. Make sure the router supports the NAT function. Most modern routers have built-in NAT functionality. 2. Connect the router to a broadband modem or other Internet connection device. Connect all computers on the LAN to the router. 3. Log in to the router and open the management interface. This is usually accessed by typing the router's IP address into a browser. You need to enter an administrator username and password to access the router settings interface. 4. Open NAT settings and enable it. In most routers, you can find the NAT settings under the "Advanced Settings" or "Network Settings" tab. 5. Configure port forwarding. If you need to host a web server or other service on your network, you'll need to configure your router to forward specific ports (for example, port 80 for HTTP) to your server. 6. Save and apply the changes. Once you are done with NAT and port forwarding setup, you need to save and apply the changes so they will take effect. 7. Test the NAT settings. Try accessing the Internet from a computer on the LAN using an Internet browser to ensure that the NAT is configured correctly. By properly configuring and using NAT, you can easily connect computers on your LAN to the Internet while securing your network and managing access to external networks.
