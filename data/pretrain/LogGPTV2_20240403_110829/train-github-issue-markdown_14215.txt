Hello everyone,

I'm currently learning Deno and have found the documentation to be very clear, concise, and consistent overall. However, I encountered a 404 error when trying to access the following page:

https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.1/runtime/cache_api

Could someone please check this link and provide an update if it has been moved or if there is an alternative resource available?

Thank you!
