It appears you are encountering a `TypeError: 'frozenset' object is not callable` when attempting to use `easy_install` to install `pip` on your system. This error often indicates that there's an issue with one of the Python packages installed, in this case, it seems to be related to the `hashlib` package.

### Steps to Resolve the Issue:

1. **Uninstall the problematic `hashlib` package**:
   The solution provided, which involves removing a specific version of the `hashlib` package, can resolve the issue. Here’s how you can do it:

   ```sh
   sudo rm -rf /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/hashlib-20081119-py2.7-macosx-10.11-intel.egg
   ```

   This command removes the problematic `hashlib` package from your Python 2.7 site-packages directory.

2. **Reinstall `setuptools` and `pip`**:
   After removing the problematic package, it’s a good idea to reinstall `setuptools` and `pip` to ensure they are up-to-date and correctly configured.

   ```sh
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   sudo python get-pip.py
   ```

   This will download and run the `get-pip.py` script, which installs or upgrades `pip` and `setuptools`.

3. **Verify the installation**:
   Once the installation is complete, you can verify that `pip` is working correctly by checking its version:

   ```sh
   pip --version
   ```

   If `pip` is installed and working, you should see the version number displayed.

### Additional Tips:

- **Use a Virtual Environment**: To avoid such issues in the future, consider using virtual environments for your Python projects. This isolates your project dependencies and helps prevent conflicts between different versions of packages.

  ```sh
  pip install virtualenv
  virtualenv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Upgrade to Python 3**: Python 2.7 has reached its end of life and is no longer supported. It’s highly recommended to upgrade to Python 3, which is actively maintained and has many improvements and security updates.

  You can install Python 3 using a package manager like `Homebrew` on macOS:

  ```sh
  brew install python
  ```

  Then, you can use `pip3` to manage your Python 3 packages.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `TypeError` and get `pip` working correctly on your system.
