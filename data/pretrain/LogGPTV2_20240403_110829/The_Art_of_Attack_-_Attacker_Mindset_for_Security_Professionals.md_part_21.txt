understanding and execution, there are conceivable and proven breach
methods for those defenses. Things like phishing, vishing imper-
sonation, social engineering, malicious insider, physical theft, recon,
unpatched vulnerabilities, zero day exploits, unpatched systems, DNS
leaking, IOT attacks, breach data, network attacks, and covert entry
methods—some overlap in e xecution at times.
This is a good way to gain an understanding of an attack surface
(broadly speaking), which should ultimately translate to the identi-
fication or creation of vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities
. . .or as I like to call them: FUNerabilites. See what I did there. . .?
Vulnerabilities are where the security provisions employed do
not properly defend against the hazards of their counters. As stated
by Ross Anderson, professor of computer security at University of
Cambridge, in his book Security Engineering (Wiley, 2008): “Vulner-
abilities are where a property of a system or its environment, which
in conjunction with an external threat, can lead to a security failure.”
Vulnerabilities are like magic to you as an attacker; they are your
means of achieving the objective. You can find them; you can also cre-
ate them. You have the unfair, asymmetrical advantage. A studying
of the attack surface deserves your full attention throughout any job.
184 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
AMs Applied to the Attack Vectors
As you have noted by now, attackers exploit businesses and peo-
ple through a variety of means— phishing, vishing, impersonation,
physical, and smishing—a ll of which require a custom solution
for each client. They also all require AMs to be executed well. We
haven’t explored phishing or smishing in this book because the
examples used to illustrate points from my career haven’t often
included them.
However, to ensure you have a view of all the means available
to you in which to execute your attacks, we will discuss phishing,
looking at the subcategories of spearphishing and whaling as well.
We will also look at smishing and impersonation. Viewing each of
these through the lens of AMs requirements, we can break them
down and see how we can garner enough information through
each of these vectors to steal, change, or destroy information, one
of which is typically the objective.
In the notes section of this book, you will also find other books
and materials to read if you want to learn more about each of these
vectors, beyond what is relevant for this chapter.
Phishing
Phishing may have been what gave social engineering its rise to
fame— it’s prevalent and easy to understand for most of the public.
I would go as far as to say, it’s basically the common pigeon of Inter-
net attacks. We’ve all seen one, we’ve all recognized one, they are
all too common now. However, phishing makes headlines because,
try as we might, the infosec community cannot seem to quash the
veracity of which phishing campaigns conquer.
Most typically, phishing relies on a simple method: emails are
sent under false pretenses, like Amazon wanting to update your
payment information or your bank detecting unusual activity with
a link straight to the evidence. The emails are often sent to multiple
targets at a time, although spearphishing sees them heavily custom-
ized and extremely convincing for most.
Attack Strategy 185
The goal of a typical phishing attack is, most often, to get a tar-
get to reveal their logins, passwords, and payment information.
Viruses are sent that gather sensitive logon information, and oth-
ers that recruit target machines into botnets that are used to send
illegal spam through networks. Others can be used to obtain intel-
lectual property. Deciding which one of these to use doesn’t truly
matter from an AMs perspective, because generally the scope is the
deciding factor.
There are two important components of a phish for your AMs
to consider. The first is messaging and the second is how that is
malicious, although the latter is beyond the scope of this book.
A single phish can often do most of the heavy lifting for you as
an attacker, which is both anticlimactic for most people and deli-
ciously empowering to know (and use). The next few sections will
look at the various types of phish and which AMs features they
should employ.
Mass Phish
Arguably, a mass phish is the easiest phish to write because it ben-
efits from the Barnum effect, but with a twist. The Barnum effect
is a common psychological phenomenon that allows people to be
convinced that the developed statements are personal to them. The
statements are so vague or broad that people can interpret them in
their own way, finding their own meaning and sometimes feeling in
awe of their accuracy. A good example is a horoscope. Mine today,
from Astrology.com, says the following:
This time of year is all about getting out of your comfort zone. Don’t
be afraid to stretch yourself and refresh your perspective. This story
is highlighted today, as the creatively rich Pisces moon aligns with
your ruler, action- taking Mars. Use this energy to push ahead with
personal projects . . .
. . . You could have a new idea, spark of inspiration or work on a
project that allows you to tap into this side of yourself. Even if your
job is quite analytical, today will require you to flex a different men-
tal muscle.
186 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
There’s not a single sentence in there that cannot be applied to
one of the tens of millions of people who believe in horoscopes and
partake in pseudo- spirituality.
Now for the simple twist: although the Barnum effect allows
individuals to give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their
personality, a phish plays on generalities specific to an environ-
ment— if you work for a bank, you may well be expecting an email
about HR updates in January. If you live in the United States, you
might expect to be contacted about your vote in an election year. If
you have an email account that was active before February 2020,
you definitely got email about COVID-19.
As far as AMs is concerned, a lesser amount of effort goes into
these types of phish. They have to be themed for their audience and
sent in a way that makes sense (e.g., time of day). They don’t have to
be 100 percent believable; they just need to have enough believabil-
ity to pique the target’s curiosity. For example, the target might not
need to know about “Changes to Capital Gains Tax” for their current
bank role, but it’s a familiar term, and here is a general call from—-
seemingly—t he right department telling them that they must sign this
acknowledgment. They may not need to know about “WFH Policy
Updates,” but they might click anyway, because the email has made it
sound important, has given them a call to action (the link, usually in
disguise), and has made it easy for them to follow that line of action.
Almost all AMs here is channeled into making it believable for
the masses and not too specific, overbearing, or long. No one enjoys
a long email.
Make it short.
Make it pointed.
Make it clear.
Give it a call to action.
Give it believability.
Tie it to the objective you’ve been given (through its theme).
Spearphish
A spearphish targets specific people or specific positions within
organizations. Whereas most phishing attacks implement a “throw
Attack Strategy 187
1,000 daggers in the water, and see if you can hit a fish or two,”
spearphishing is often carried out with some knowledge about the
target. Spearphishing emails will often be personalized by name
and appear to come from someone the target knows. Some recent
studies, including one from TrendMicro ( https://www.trendmicro
.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-a nd-d igital-t hreats/
spear-p hishing-i s- the- favored-t argeted-a ttack-b ait), suggest
that up to 91 percent of data breaches within organizations start
with a spearphishing email.
Where mass phishing expeditions typically use broad strokes to
create a malicious email, spearphishing attacks are slightly more
sophisticated. They involve documents containing malware or links
to credential- stealing sites, including cloned sites, to steal sensitive
information or valuable intellectual property.
But what do they require of you as an attacker, you may won-
der? Spearphishing is a campaign built with a goal of penetrating
an organization, not often the individual themselves. The research
needed is mid-l evel; you will have to know names, as spearphish
attacks are most typically addressed to the recipient; roles and job
level are also things you must research for this type of phish.
The message itself will have to be believable and centered on
the target. You will have to theme it according to your objective—
meaning you should give them a reason to click the link or open
the file that makes sense and that they can’t resist and it can be
personalized.
It will still have to be short, although I typically allow for a sen-
tence or two more in a spearphish.
It will still have to be pointed.
It will still have to be clear.
Whaling
Whaling is somewhat similar to spearphishing but directed toward
upper management and C- suite positions at an organization.
There’s no immunity from whaling within an organization, and
that’s a pretty good position to start off in as an attacker. Even Face-
book and Google have been scammed at the highest levels—t hey
188 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
were scammed out of $100 million in 2019 according to CNBC
(https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/phishing-e mail-s cam-s tole-
100- million-f rom-f acebook-a nd- google.html). Whaling emails
were sent to some whales that had some authority and ultimately
got counterfeit invoices paid.
What do whaling phishes require from an AMs perspective?
They require research, as you want to hit the right whale or whales,
taking into account susceptibility, vulnerability, and scope.
You will be required to investigate three categories:
1. First, you explore the company landscape in two ways:
• You will have to learn about the company— what do they
do, what their reputation is from a client/consumer point
of view, and what it is from an employee point of view.
• You will also benefit from getting a sense of what things
look like on the inside— you’ll want to know how they
communicate as a company both in terms of vernacular
and technology- wise; you may benefit from learning the
distance between the C- suite and the D- suite, for example,
or how casual the corporate culture seems and how busy
upper management is.
2. The second thing you will have to investigate is the indi-
vidual you want to send the email to. You won’t need eve-
rything you come across, but you might note it in case the
track you decide to follow ends up fruitless. For example,
you might find that the CEO you are targeting was divorced,
usually an emotive topic that could override most logic,
ultimately allowing a reply or otherwise inadvisable action.
However, you might also find out that although the news
outlets are marking the occasion, he was actually divorced
20 years prior and his ex- wife is actually now his late ex-
wife. There would be little point in emailing him as her
attorney, and even if she were alive, typically most things
have been taken care of 20 years after a divorce in terms of
legalities, so it’s a somewhat fruitless track. It would take
up too much of your time to bend this information into a
believable story, so you’d be better off to look elsewhere.
Attack Strategy 189
Not every company will allow this style of an attack. You
can always list it as a potential avenue, even if you can’t
carry it out due to scope or your own ethical boundaries.
However, if you’ve gotten to know your target and company
and you’ve arrived at a dead end with one attack, you hopefully
have enough information to lead you to another attack.
To execute a whaling attack well, your AMs— specifically
your curiosity, persistence, and law 2—i s best applied to the
following areas: public records, legal subpoenas, news sources,
and social media accounts. Friends of the target’s social media
often provide information, too, even if they don’t have much of a
presence themselves. This is because people like to know people
deemed important. If you are targeting someone with any level
of celebrity (micro or macro), it’s likely that someone, some-
where is talking about them on social media, talking about the
good times, commenting on photos, and so forth.
Research of any kind will aid you on your phishing quest.
For example, a malicious attacker was able to successfully attack
Mattel— a multinational toy manufacturing company— using
research. Through investigation, the attacker learned there was
some internal turmoil in the company. The attacker researched
the company’s organizational chart and found that Mattel
required signatures for payments. The attacker also used social
media to learn the names of key individuals sending requests for
funds. On top of this, the attacker also recognized the company
had just hired a new CEO and was looking to expand into China.
A request for a wire transfer to the Bank of Wenzhou seemed
like a good bet for the attacker and authentic from the target’s
perspective.
3. It is the level of sophistication of the whale that matters most.
You cannot afford generalities; everything must be targeted,
including who it comes from, which should be a trusted source.
Usually, a trusted source is someone with whom the executive
190 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
expects to communicate, which is the third branch of a whaling
phish you must investigate.
You have to look for information on the source, whether you
are sending the phish from inside or outside the organization, so
that you can replicate their communication style. Whale phish-
ing attacks are successful because they are well planned. You
must seek to find the behavior of the target, their patterns, and
business headlines relevant to them. This level of deception will
make it hard to tell the difference between a whale phish and a
real email.
In all honesty, the thing that makes whaling hardest for me is
that I cannot gauge who they are, what they are like, or how they
operate. I often find myself navigating to YouTube or some version
of it where I can see them, whether it be in an interview or in a
casual conversation.
Whaling requires a sort of superiority that some of the other
types of phishing can lack and yet still be successful. Whaling will
require more of your AMs than the others.
Make it high-l evel.
Make it relevant.
Make it pointed.
Make it clear.
Lend it credence through investigation and research.
Vishing
I enjoy conducting a vishing call. They are often similar to a phish-
ing attack, insofar as they are typically used as a way to extract infor-
mation, but a vish is conducted over the phone. Unlike a phish, you
have immediate data on the target— many things can be conveyed
through a voice, which means that AMs can be employed in one of
its most natural states: as agility in reaction. If the target answers,
you can infer a lot from their voice. If you are right— great, proceed.
If you are wrong— great, pivot. It’s the same in the field.
Attack Strategy 191
Vishing can be used to learn many things, but it all boils down
to either gathering information or using the vish in conjunction
with a phish. I will break these two methods down so as to be clear.
When gathering information, you might vish a target belong-
ing to the organization you’ve been hired to test in order to ascer-
tain how much information they will willingly hand over. Typically,
banks employ people to vish their workforce this way. I will call up
as a member of the HR team citing the “recent company changes,”
which, even if there are none, tends to work. Before long I will ask
them to confirm some items on their record, such as marital sta-
tus, the best contact number for them outside of work, their Social
Security number, and so forth.
Another pretext often used is that of IT, usually calling about a
database that was cloned incorrectly and thus leading to discrepan-
cies in the data. If the target doesn’t wish to answer and they are
low enough on the rung, I will pivot and ask for their email and
their manager’s name so that I can gather the needed information
from them. People are usually willing to oblige—t heir manager
will, after all, know what to do and be pleased that they themselves
did not give out information, only that of someone else within the
organization.
The second reason to vish is to use it along with a phish.
My favorite.
When vishing, it’s the three first laws of AMs that have the most
impact. The first law states that you start with the end in mind. It is
a way of taking information in and applying it to an objective, and
in this case steering the call through the information you provide
in order to get to the objective. The second law states that you must
weaponize information for the good of the objective. The third law
states that you never break pretext. I tend most often to focus on
the hardest flag to get. (A flag is a piece of information or asset you
are aiming for. The objective can consist of multiple flags or just
one.) I do this because it informs my pretext well. As an example,
if my objective is made up of three flags— getting the target’s full
name, their job title, and their Social Security number—I will focus
