User: I'm new to python. I want to create controlled script executed from /etc/init.d command like /etc/init.d something start/stop/restart 
Any advise appreciated.
Assistant: Pardus initialization (http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng/projects/comar/SpeedingUpLinuxWithPardus.html) is based on python and in theory you can even start system with windows executable (through Wine of course). You can see a sample initialisation script there doing almost same thing with shell script but in a pythonic way.
