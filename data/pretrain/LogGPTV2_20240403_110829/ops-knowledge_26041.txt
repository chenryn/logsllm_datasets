User: using autoenv and virtualenvwrapper in python and trying to configure in it the specific python version. 
the autoenv file (called .env) contains (simply)
echo 'my_env'
is there a way to configure it's python version?
Assistant: When creating virtual environment, you can specify which python to use.
For example,
virtualenv -p/usr/bin/python2.7 env
Same for mkvirtualenv
