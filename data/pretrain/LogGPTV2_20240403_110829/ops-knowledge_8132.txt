User: I'm working on the default python interpreter on Mac OS X, and I Cmd+K (cleared) my earlier commands. I can go through them one by one using the arrow keys. But is there an option like the --history option in bash shell, which shows you all the commands you've entered so far?
Assistant: In IPython %history -g should give you the entire command history. The default configuration also saves your history into a file named .python_history in your user directory.
