I am encountering an issue with `PdoSessionStorage` where values set in the user's session are not being saved. For more information, please refer to the following forum post: [Symfony Forum - PdoSessionStorage Issue](http://forum.symfony-project.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=51646).

My current environment is as follows:
- PHP version: 5.4.4
- Symfony version: 2.1.2 (recently updated using `php composer.phar update`)

Any assistance with this problem would be greatly appreciated.
