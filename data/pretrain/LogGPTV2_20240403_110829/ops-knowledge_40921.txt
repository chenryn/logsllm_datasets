User: I am using Daemon tool to mount an ISO image on Windows XP machine.I do mount using Daemon command (daemon.exe -mount 0,iso_path).
Above command will mount ISO image to device number. In my case I have 4 partition (C,D,E,F) and G for DVD/CD-RW. Now what happen, ISO gets mounted to drive letter 'H:' with name (as defined while creating ISO) say 'testmount'. 
My queries:-
1) How can I get mount name of mounted ISO image (i.e. 'testmount'). 
 Just another case; if there are already some mount points existing on machine and I created a new one using Daemon tool. Then If I can get latest one using script that will be great.
2) How to get drive letter where it did get mounted.
If anyone know python script or command (or even Win command ) to get these info. do let  me know.
Thanks...
