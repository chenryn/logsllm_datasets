Abstract-Bounds 
a simple upper-bound, 
on performance of a queueing model can 
provide useful information 
to guarantee quality of service for 
communication networks. We study the bounds on the mean 
delay in a transient GIIGIIl queue given the first two moments 
of the service time and the inter-arrival 
establish 
which then is used to show that 
the true transient mean-delay is at most four times larger than 
an asymptotic diffusion-approximation. 
We also prove that the 
tight lower-bound is zero as long as the service time and the 
inter-arrival 
time have finite variance and the load is below 
one. Tightness of the trivial lower-bound is in contrast to the 
stationary 
when the service time is sufficiently 
our results can be applied to analyze the transient mean delay 
of packets in the real-world Internet.
