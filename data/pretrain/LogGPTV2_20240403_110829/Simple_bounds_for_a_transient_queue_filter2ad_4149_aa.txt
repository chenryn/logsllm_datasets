## Abstract
Bounds on the performance of a queueing model can provide valuable information to ensure quality of service in communication networks. This paper investigates the bounds on the mean delay in a transient GI/GI/1 queue given the first two moments of the service time and inter-arrival time. We establish a simple upper bound, which demonstrates that the true transient mean delay is at most four times larger than an asymptotic diffusion approximation. We also prove that the tight lower bound is zero, provided the service time and inter-arrival time have finite variance and the load is below one. The tightness of this trivial lower bound contrasts with the stationary case, where the service time must be sufficiently large for a strictly positive lower bound. Our results are applicable to analyzing the transient mean delay of packets in real-world Internet traffic. We also show how our bounds can be used to predict the mean delay when only the first two moments of the service and inter-arrival times are known.

## I. Introduction
Performance metrics of queueing models have been extensively studied in the literature, motivated by both practical and theoretical considerations. From a practical perspective, these bounds can guarantee quality of service for communication networks. Theoretically, they help understand how different parameters affect the performance of the queueing model. In this paper, we focus on the bounds on the mean delay of a transient GI/GI/1 queue given the first two moments of the service time \( S \) and the inter-arrival time \( A \).

Although the behavior of the GI/GI/1 queue in steady state has been well-investigated (e.g., [16], [22]), its transient behavior is not fully understood, especially under high load conditions. Communication networks often experience high loads, but these periods are typically short. Therefore, it is crucial to study the transient behavior to ensure reliable performance during such periods.

### A. Contributions
Our primary contribution is the derivation of simple lower and upper bounds on the mean delay in a transient GI/GI/1 queue given the first two moments of \( S \) and \( A \). Specifically, let \( W_n \) be the delay of the \( n \)-th job arriving at a GI/GI/1 queue under the first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy, with the condition that the 0-th job arrives at an empty queue (i.e., \( W_0 = 0 \)).

We prove that:
\[ E[W_n] \leq \text{upper bound} \]
where the arrival rate is \( \lambda \), the load is \( \rho \), and \( C_A \) (respectively, \( C_S \)) is the coefficient of variation of \( A \) (respectively, \( S \)). The upper bound holds for any \( n \geq 0 \), and we also establish tighter bounds. We also prove that the tight lower bound is zero as long as the service time and inter-arrival time have finite variance and the load is below one.

### B. Related Work
The upper bound proposed in this paper is constructed using simpler terms compared to existing bounds, which involve arctangent and logarithmic functions. Although there is extensive literature on bounds for the transient and stationary GI/GI/1 queue, our bounds are complementary to the existing ones and provide additional insights.

## II. Simple Bounds on Transient Mean-Delay
Consider a GI/GI/1 queue, where \( A \) denotes the inter-arrival time and \( S \) the service time. Let \( \lambda = \frac{1}{E[A]} \) be the arrival rate, \( \rho = \frac{E[S]}{E[A]} \) be the load, \( \mu = \frac{1}{E[S]} \) be the service rate, \( C_A = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Var}[A]}{E[A]^2}} \) be the coefficient of variation for \( A \), and \( C_S = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Var}[S]}{E[S]^2}} \). Let \( W_n \) be the delay of the \( n \)-th job for \( n \geq 1 \), given that the 0-th job arrives at an empty queue (i.e., \( W_0 = 0 \)).

In this section, we present simple lower and upper bounds on \( E[W_n] \).

## III. Numerical and Simulation Results
In Section IV, we compare the simple upper bound against the diffusion approximation and evaluate it numerically and through trace-driven simulations. We show that the extremal distributions that maximize \( E[W_n] \) given the first two moments of \( S \) and \( A \) can be applied to analyze the transient GI/GI/1 queue, particularly when inter-arrival and service times have correlations.

## IV. Application to Real-World Traffic
Finally, we demonstrate how our upper bounds can be used to predict the mean delay of packets in the real-world Internet, where there are dependencies in inter-arrival and service times. Using traffic datasets made public by the MAWI Working Group, we substitute the parameters into our upper bound expression and show that our bound is useful even when the inter-arrival and service times have correlations.

## V. Conclusion
In summary, we have derived simple lower and upper bounds on the mean delay in a transient GI/GI/1 queue given the first two moments of the service and inter-arrival times. These bounds are useful for both theoretical understanding and practical applications in communication networks. Future work will focus on extending these results to more complex queueing models and further validating them with real-world data.
