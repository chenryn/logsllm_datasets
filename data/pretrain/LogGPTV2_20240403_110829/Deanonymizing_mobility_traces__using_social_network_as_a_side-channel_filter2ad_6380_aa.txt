## Abstract
Location-based services, which utilize data from smartphones, vehicles, and other mobile devices, have gained significant popularity. To mitigate the privacy risks associated with shared location data, some services anonymize or obfuscate this information. In this paper, we demonstrate that these methods can be effectively defeated: a set of location traces can be deanonymized using an easily obtained social network graph. The core idea is that a user can be identified by the people they meet. A contact graph, which identifies meetings between anonymized users in a set of traces, can be structurally correlated with a social network graph to identify anonymized users. We validate our approach using three real-world datasets: University of St Andrews mobility trace and social network (27 nodes each), SmallBlue contact trace and Facebook social network (125 nodes), and Infocom 2006 Bluetooth contact traces and conference attendees' DBLP social network (78 nodes). Our experiments show that 80% of users are correctly identified, 8% are incorrectly identified, and the remaining 4% are mapped to a small set of users (no more than three).

## 1. Introduction
Applications that employ sensor data (e.g., location, acceleration) generated by everyday mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and cars have become increasingly popular. For example, CarTel [15] collects location information from GPS sensors in cars to infer traffic conditions, and GreenGPS [11] computes fuel-optimal routes from OBD-II sensors installed in cars.

To reduce the risk of exposing too much information, it has been suggested that those who collect mobility traces could anonymize them by removing personally identifying information (PII), such as name, address, or birthday. Unfortunately, prior work has shown that PII removed from other kinds of datasets can be recovered by employing auxiliary information [24]; this recovery process is called deanonymization. The key question is: in the case of mobility traces, does there exist readily available auxiliary information with which an adversary could effectively perform deanonymization? In this paper, we show that the answer is 'yes.'

Mobility traces can be deanonymized by exploiting the social network of the participating users. Such social networks are readily available: friend relationships can be found from public Facebook data, co-authorship relationships from DBLP, and business relationships from LinkedIn. The key insight is that a pattern of meetings between users suggests they have a relationship; this relationship may be mirrored in their social network and thus the social network can be used to recover PII removed from a trace.

## 2. Problem Setup
### 2.1 Notation and Terminology
- **VS**: Set of users, each with a unique identifier.
- **L**: Set of location identifiers, each with a unique identifier.
- **d(l1, l2)**: Distance between two locations l1 and l2 in L.
- **A**: Location trace of the form <u, l, t>*, where u ∈ VS, l ∈ L, and t is a timestamp.
- **VC**: Set of anonymized user identifiers, i.e., the mapping between VS and VC is unknown.
- **L'**: Set of obfuscated location identifiers. Location identifiers may be obfuscated using techniques such as adding random noise or generalization.
- **A'**: Anonymized location trace of the form <u', l', t>*, where u' ∈ VC, l' ∈ L', and t is a timestamp.
- **S**: Social network represented as S = (VS, ES), where ES contains edges of the form <u1, u2, r12, w12>, with u1, u2 ∈ VS, r12 ∈ R (relationship type), and w12 (weight and periodicity).

### 2.2 Datasets
We use three real-world datasets to validate our approach:

1. **University of St Andrews**:
   - **Mobility Trace**: WiFi hotspot connections at 300-second intervals.
   - **Social Network**: Facebook friend relationships.
   - **Nodes**: 27
   - **Duration**: 30 days
   - **Granularity**: 300 seconds
   - **Contacts**: 18,241

2. **SmallBlue**:
   - **Mobility Trace**: Instant messenger contacts on an enterprise network.
   - **Social Network**: Facebook friend relationships.
   - **Nodes**: 125
   - **Duration**: 30 days
   - **Granularity**: 300 seconds
   - **Contacts**: 240,665

3. **Infocom 2006**:
   - **Mobility Trace**: Bluetooth contact traces of conference attendees.
   - **Social Network**: DBLP co-authorship relationships.
   - **Nodes**: 78
   - **Duration**: 4 days
   - **Granularity**: 120 seconds
   - **Contacts**: 182,951

## 3. Approach and Evaluation
The key idea behind our approach is to identify discriminating features in the social network graph when performing deanonymization. For instance, if a user d is a friend of both b and c, while e is a friend of only b, these relationships can be used to discriminate d and e. We transfer these constraints to the contact graph and solve for the variables to uniquely map anonymized users.

Our initial results show that our approach deanonymizes 80% of the nodes in the traces correctly, 8% incorrectly, and the remaining 4% are mapped to a small set of users (no more than three). Even when about 25% of the social network and the contact graph is intentionally modified, our approach remains effective. Additionally, when a small fraction (5%) of select node mappings (particularly nodes with low centrality scores) are known a priori, the effectiveness of our approach can exceed 95%.

## 4. Impact of Noise and Incomplete Data
We evaluate the impact of adding noise to the data and using inaccurate or incomplete social network graphs. Our results show that while the addition of noise and the use of incomplete data degrade the efficacy of deanonymization, our approach remains robust under moderate levels of perturbation.

## 5. Related Work
We discuss related work in the field of deanonymization and highlight the contributions of our approach in the context of existing literature.

## 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, we present a method for deanonymizing mobility traces using social networks as a side-channel. Our approach leverages the structural correlation between contact graphs and social network graphs to identify anonymized users. We validate our method using real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness even under noisy and incomplete data conditions.
