If I install `babel-plugin-transform-runtime` into a new project, NPM will
install `babel-runtime` 5.x. This makes sense, as basically everything else
uses a 5.x `babel-runtime` too.
The problem is that it requires methods based on the 6.1.4 filenames,
rendering it basically useless.
This produces errors like this when I try to run Webpack on the resultant
files:
    Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'babel-runtime/helpers/defineProperty'
    Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'babel-runtime/helpers/slicedToArray'
    Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'babel-runtime/helpers/objectWithoutProperties'
These errors only occur when running `babel-plugin-transform-runtime`. I've
tried it on 6.1.4, 6.1.2 and 6.0.2. I've also tried downgrading the versions
of various other packages to 6.1.2 and 6.0.2. I've also removed `node_modules`
and done a complete `npm install` on each of these steps.
