ABSTRACT 
Despite  many  years  of  research  and  significant  commercial 
investment,  the  malware  problem  is  far  from  being  solved  (or 
even  reasonably  well  contained).  Every  week,  the  main-  stream 
press publishes articles that describe yet another in- cident where 
millions  of  credit  cards  were  leaked,  a  large  company  discloses 
that  adversaries  had  remote  access  to  its  corporate  secrets  for 
years,  and  we  discover  a  new  botnet  with  tens  of  thousands  of 
compromised machines. Clearly, this situation is not acceptable, 
but why isn't it getting any better? 
In this talk, I will discuss some of the reasons why the malware 
problem  is  fundamentally  hard,  and  why  existing  defenses  in 
industry are no longer working. I will then outline progress that 
researchers  and  industry  have  made  over  the  last  years,  and 
highlight a few milestones in our struggle to keep malicious code 
off  our  computer  systems.  This  part  will  not  focus  on  advances 
related to the analysis of malicious code alone, but take a broader 
perspective.  How  can  we  prevent  malicious  code  from  getting 
onto our machines in the first place? How can we detect network 
communication  between  malware  programs  and  remote  control 
nodes? And how can we lower the benefits that attackers obtain 
from their compromised machines? Finally, I will point out a few 
areas in which I believe that we should make progress to have the 
most impact in our fight against malicious code.
