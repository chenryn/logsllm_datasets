Therefore, it follows immediately the ﬁrst result:
We now upper bound Pr [K = K ′ ∧ Y = Y ′ : E]. This collision probability is equal
to:
K ← UKeys
≤ Pr(cid:2)K = K ′ ∧ Y = Y ′ : E(cid:3)
Pr(cid:20)K = K ′ :
K ′ ← UKeys(cid:21)

2k(cid:18)Pr(cid:20)X = X ′ :

This can be restated as:
Let denote by DA and D′
A two distributions given by two independent runs of A
and DB the product distribution DA × D′
A. Let B be the following cau-adversary: B
runs A twice independently, simulating A challenger. Let denote DA and D′
A the two
distributions given by A in each run and DB the probability distribution which is sent
by B to the challenger which is constructed as describe above. Since DA and D′
A have
min-entropy at least m, DB has min-entropy at least 2m.
The time complexity of B is 2TA + O(1) and its cau-advantage is exactly:
Pr
X 6= X ′
H(K, X) = H(K, X ′)

This cau-advantage is upper bounded by 1/2t + ε, thus Pr [K = K ′ ∧ Y = Y ′ : E]
is upper bounded by:

For every ﬁxed distributions DA and D′
A, the probability Pr(cid:20)X = X ′ :
X ← DA,
X ′ ← D′
A,(cid:21)
is equal to: Xx
Pr(cid:2)X = x : X ← DA(cid:3) Pr(cid:2)X ′ = x : X ′ ← D′
A,(cid:3) .
This can be upper bounded using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, namely it is upper
bounded by:
As DA and DA has min-entropy at least m, this is smaller than 2−m/2·2−m/2 ≤ 2−m. As
A ⇒ DA, X ← DA,
this is true for every ﬁxed DA and D′
A, X ′ ← D′
A ⇒ D′

and we have:

If ε ≤ 2−m, and we want to impose a 2−e security, this result can be restated as:
m ≥ t + 2e + 1.
C.2 The Preﬁx-Free cLHL
Lemma 10 (pf computational LHL). Let H be a family of functions from {0, 1}k ×
Dom to {0, 1}t such that for every au-adversary B, running in time T and producing a
distribution over Dom×Dom of min-entropy at least 2m−2, advpf−cau
(B) ≤ 1/2t +ε.
Then for every adversary A running in time O(T ) producing a distribution of min-
entropy at least m:
H
advpf-cre
H
(A) ≤p2t · (3 · 2−m + ε).
Proof. The proof is similar to the previous proof, excepted the way the cau-adversary
B is simulated.
Let denote by DA and D′
A two distributions given by two independent runs of A
and Dπ the product distribution DA × D′
A. First note that since DA may be diﬀerent
A we may have X ⊂ X ′ or X ′ ⊂ X and Dπ
from D′
A, for every X ← DA and X ′ ← D′
is not guaranteed to be preﬁx-free. Therefore the adversary B cannot generates the
probability distribution Dπ.
Combining the previous equation with equation 3 we have:
Pr(cid:2)K = K ′ ∧ Y = Y ′ : E(cid:3) ≤

It follows immediately:
23
Let DB be the following distribution: choose (X, X ′) following Dπ, if X ⊂ X ′
or X ′ ⊂ X, then choose Y uniformly at random in Dom and output (Y, Y ), else
output (X, X ′). Let show that this eﬃciently samplable probability distribution has
min-entropy at least 2m − 2. By deﬁnition of preﬁx-freeness for every x′ there is at
most one x such that x ⊂ x′, PrDa[X = x] > 0 and PrD′
a[X ′ = x′] > 0. Therefore, the
probability that X ⊂ X ′ is equal toPx′ Pr[X ′ = x′]Px Pr[X = x] Pr[x ⊂ x′]. Due to
the previous remark, there is at most one term in the sumPx Pr[X = x] Pr[x ⊂ x′]
and the sum is upper bounded by the min-entropy 2−m. Thus, Pr[X ⊂ X ′] is upper
bounded by 2−m. Therefore the probability to obtain a couple (x, x′) which is not
preﬁx-free is smaller than 2−2m and the probability of a couple (y, y) is upper bounded
by 2−2m + 2 · 2−m · |Dom|−1, which is upper bounded by 4 · 2−2m. The min-entropy of
DB is thus greater than 2m − 2 and DB is preﬁx-free.
The time complexity of B is 2TA + O(1) and its cau-advantage is exactly:
This cau-advantage is upper bounded by 1/2t + ε. Besides, it is equal to

Pr
If (x, x′) is preﬁx-free, PrDπ [(X, X ′) = (x, x′)] is equal to PrDB [(X, X ′) = (x, x′)],

It is smaller than Pr[(X ⊂ X ′ ∨ X ′ ⊂ X) ∧ X 6= X ′] + 2t + ε, which is upper bounded
by 2 · 2−m + 2t + ε. With the upper bound for this probability, the proof is similar to
the previous one.
