Sami Bhiri is a postdoctoral researcher at DERI - the National University of Ireland, Galway, where he
is involved in managing several EU projects. Before joining DERI, he was a research and teaching as-
sistant in the University of Nancy 1 and in the ECOO team of the LORIA-INRIA research laboratory. His
research interests are in the area of applying semantics to B2B integration, service oriented computing
and business process management.
Walid Gaaloul is a postdoctoral researcher at the National University of Ireland, Galway, where he is
involved in several EU projects. Before joining DERI, he was a research in the ECOO team of the LORIA-
INRIA research laboratory and teaching assistant in the University of Nancy 1. His research interests lie
in the area of business process management, process intelligence, process reliability, service oriented
computing and semantics for B2B integration.
Claude Godart is full time professor at Nancy University, France and scientific director of the INRIA
ECOO project. His centre of interest concentrates on the consistency maintenance of the data mediating
the cooperation between several partners. This encompasses advanced transaction models, user centric
workflow and web services composition models. He has been implicated in several transfer projects with
industries (France, Europe, and Japan) for a wide range of applications including e-commerce, software
processes and e-learning.
