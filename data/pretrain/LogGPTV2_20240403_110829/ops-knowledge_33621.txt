User: How do I implement some logic that will allow me to reproduce on Windows the functionality that I have on Linux with the fork() system call, using Python?
I'm specifically trying to execute a method on the SAPI Com component, while continuing the other logic in the main thread without blocking or waiting.
Assistant: The Threading example from Eli will run the thread, but not do any of the work after that line.  
I'm going to look into the processing module and the subprocess module.  I think the com method I'm running needs to be in another process, not just in another thread.
