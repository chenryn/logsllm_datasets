Figure 1: Pseudonymizing client
Internet client for a diversity of Internet applications.
In
general, the proposed service seeks to provide both sender
pseudonymity and anonymizing service. We have sender
pseudonymity as the property that the pseudonym identi-
ﬁer conveyed in a message is not linkable to its true sender’s
identiﬁer (in the CDN case, CDN client’s IP address). And
we have anonymizing service as the capability that the re-
cipient’s service (in the CDN case, CDN name resolution
service provided by CDN’s authoritative DNS server) is op-
timally tailored based on the source pseudonym identiﬁer of
a message.
Note that the proposal is especially eﬀective for defense
of sender privacy in sender-sensitive system. The main dif-
ference of sender privacy between sender-sensitive system
and sender-insensitive system is that sender’s identity such
as IP address is critical to decide the optimal response at
recipient of sender-sensitive system. However, almost all
anonymity technologies are basically designed for sender-
insensitive rather than sender-sensitive system [1],[2]. As
sender-insensitive systems do not rely on the sender’s real
identity to provide service, the concept of simply using the
proxy’s or relayer’s identity rather than the sender’s real
identity to obtain the optimal service is applicable. Thus
previous anonymity research on sender-insensitive system fo-
cus on oﬀsprings of mix networks that use a chain of proxy
servers to create hard-to-trace communications so that no
single entity has information about both the sender and the
receiver. Those anonymity proposals vary in their latency,
trust level, network type, anonymity properties, or adver-
sary capabilities. By contrast, we argue that sender-sensitive
systems change the anonymity goal from concealing sender’s
identity to encoding sender’s identity in order to enable the
optimized service through decoding sender’s identity. For
example, in the CDN case, if privacy-preserving techniques
conceal client’s IP address to authoritative servers, author-
itative servers will be unable to either perform the replica
server selection by itself or transfer the task to a third party.
2. PSEUDONYMIZING CLIENT
The pseudonymizing-Internet-client (PIC) service intro-
duces pseudonymizing identiﬁer (PI) to map original identi-
ﬁer (OI) of Internet client to it (see Fig. 1 with the number-
ing indicating the order of actions). By replacing OI with
PI in messages ( 2⃝), clients prevent privacy leakage from OI.
The mapping between OI and PI is registered, maintained
and resolved at pseudonymizing registry (PR) of a trust-
worthy third party ( 1⃝). To enable PIC service, Internet
application provider subscribes pseudonymous optimization
service to pseudonymizing optimizer (PO) at a trustworthy
third party. Upon receiving a PIC request, Internet appli-

the nearest replica server. The DNS authoritative servers
can pose privacy threats because they are able to observe,
collect, process, and transfer privacy-relevant DNS informa-
tion (such as incoming DNS traﬃc) about clients either for
the surveillance purposes of themselves or for facilitating an
outside censor by passing him the data. In particular, the
source IP address of client is of great interest to adversaries
because it can be associated with the client’s DNS messages
to reﬂect the end user’s Internet activities. In spite of CDN
performance beneﬁts, using a local recursive resolver or a
client-side recursive resolver may decrease privacy against
an observer located on an authoritative name server. This
authoritative name server will see the IP address of the client
or be able to estimate the location of the client. If EDNS-
Client-Subnet is used, the proxy-like protection of IP address
privacy is no longer present for a remote recursive resolver
because, in this case, the authoritative name server will be
able to see the original IP address (or preﬁx). To eliminate
the privacy leakage suﬀered by EDNS-Client-Subnet, the re-
cursive resolver reveals the client’s PI rather than source IP
address (OI) to the authoritative server in the DNS requests
if the PIC service is deployed and employed. The authorita-
tive server inputs the PI to the PO and obtains the optimal
results. In this way, client can experience optimal CDN ser-
vice while keeping its privacy.
The following details the process (see Fig. 2 with the
numbering indicating the order of actions): 1⃝ The client

include the PI in the DNS requests. 3⃝ Upon receiving the
DNS requests, the recursive resolver forwards the requests
with the PI to the authoritative server. 4⃝ The authorita-
tive server solicits the subscribed optimization from the PO
using the PI. 5⃝ The PO ﬁrst gets the mapping from the PI
to the target IP address through the secured pseudonymiz-
ing lookup transaction, and then chooses the optimal replica
server whose IP address is nearest to the target IP address
through subscriber-deﬁned rules and information such as us-
ing Geo IP database such as MaxMind. 6⃝ - 8⃝: The optimal
replica server is returned to the authoritative server and then
forwarded to the recursive resolver, and ﬁnally arrives at the
client in the DNS response.

Figure 2: Using pseudonymizing service in CDN
may be geographically distributed among a number of in-
stances (e.g., using anycast) but the back-end core database
is highly synchronized for data consistency; 2) Resolution.
Resolution of PI to OI is provisioned as authoritative service
at PR. Unlike public name resolution service such as DNS,
the access of PR’s resolution service is strictly limited to
its authorized POs. To protect privacy on pseudonymizing
registration against any adversaries, no unauthorized access
is allowed by PR. The authoritative data, excluding records
with invalid validity time, is generated from the registra-
tion database. Like registration service, resolution service
can also use high-performance techniques such as multiple-
replica and anycast.
Internet application provider: Prior to serve requests
for PIC-aware service, Internet application provider should
ﬁrst subscribe the pseudonymous optimization service to
PO. In the subscription, it should deliver all relevant in-
formation necessary for the OI-based optimization except
OI. Such information may include the objectives, parame-
ters, and optimization algorithms of the optimization. The
communication of the optimization related information can
be performed either in an on-the-ﬂy manner or in a pre-
conﬁguration manner. For eﬃciency, the pre-conﬁguration
manner is better for the data which are large and constant
across a number of requests while the on-the-ﬂy manner is
better for the data which is small and variable among diﬀer-
ent requests. Internet application provider retrieves the PI
in the PIC request and includes it in the pseudonymous op-
timization request sent to the subscribed PO. The ﬁnal op-
timal response is returned by Internet application provider
using the optimization response from PO.
PO: As a subscribed service for Internet application provid-
er, PO interacts with Internet application provider to gener-
ate the optimal results on behalf of it. To do this, PO should
conﬁgure the optimization objectives, parameters, methods
in the subscription from Internet application provider, if nec-
essary and if any. Once receiving the pseudonymous opti-
mization request, PO should look up the PI in the request
to obtain the mapping OI by accessing the resolution service
operated by PR. The communication between PO and PR
should be secured against sensitive PI-to-OI mapping leak-
age. In particular, PO and PR may reside at the same third
party thus both of them as well as communications between
them are protected in the same secure box.
3. CASE STUDY OF CDN
CDN is sender-sensitive in delivering its service because
it uses the client’s IP address to direct the client to the op-
timal replica server.
In the DNS-based CDN, the client’s
IP address is conveyed in the DNS requests forwarded to
