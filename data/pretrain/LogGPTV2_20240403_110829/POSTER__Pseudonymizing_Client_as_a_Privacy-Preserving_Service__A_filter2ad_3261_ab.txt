### Figure 1: Pseudonymizing Client

The pseudonymizing client is designed for a wide range of Internet applications. The proposed service aims to provide both sender pseudonymity and anonymization. 

- **Sender Pseudonymity**: This property ensures that the pseudonym identifier in a message cannot be linked to the true sender's identifier (e.g., the CDN client’s IP address).
- **Anonymizing Service**: This capability allows the recipient's service (e.g., CDN name resolution provided by the CDN’s authoritative DNS server) to be optimally tailored based on the source pseudonym identifier.

This proposal is particularly effective in protecting sender privacy in sender-sensitive systems. In such systems, the sender's identity (e.g., IP address) is crucial for determining the optimal response at the recipient. Conversely, most anonymity technologies are designed for sender-insensitive systems, where the sender's real identity is not required to provide the service. These technologies typically use proxy or relayer identities to achieve anonymity.

In contrast, sender-sensitive systems require encoding the sender's identity to enable optimized service. For example, in a Content Delivery Network (CDN), if the client's IP address is concealed from authoritative servers, these servers will be unable to perform replica server selection or delegate this task to a third party.

### 2. Pseudonymizing Client

The Pseudonymizing Internet Client (PIC) service introduces a pseudonym identifier (PI) to map the original identifier (OI) of an Internet client. By replacing the OI with the PI in messages, clients can prevent privacy leakage from their OI. The mapping between OI and PI is managed by a pseudonymizing registry (PR) at a trustworthy third party.

To enable PIC service, an Internet application provider subscribes to a pseudonymous optimization service from a pseudonymizing optimizer (PO) at a trustworthy third party. When a PIC request is received, the Internet application provider uses the PI to interact with the PO, which then provides the optimized service.

### Figure 2: Using Pseudonymizing Service in CDN

The process involves the following steps (indicated by the numbering in Figure 2):

1. The client registers its source IP address and the associated PI with the PR through a secured pseudonymizing registration transaction.
2. The client includes the PI in DNS requests using an EDNS0 option.
3. The recursive resolver forwards the DNS requests with the PI to the authoritative server.
4. The authoritative server queries the subscribed optimization from the PO using the PI.
5. The PO retrieves the mapping from the PI to the target IP address via a secured pseudonymizing lookup transaction, and then selects the optimal replica server based on subscriber-defined rules and information (e.g., using a GeoIP database like MaxMind).
6. The optimal replica server is returned to the authoritative server, which then forwards it to the recursive resolver.
7. The recursive resolver sends the response to the client.

### 3. Case Study of CDN

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are sender-sensitive because they use the client's IP address to direct the client to the optimal replica server. In a DNS-based CDN, the client's IP address is included in the DNS requests forwarded to the authoritative servers, which can pose privacy threats. These servers can observe, collect, and process privacy-relevant DNS information, potentially for surveillance or censorship purposes.

Using the PIC service, the recursive resolver reveals the client's PI instead of the source IP address (OI) to the authoritative server. The authoritative server then uses the PI to obtain the optimal results from the PO, ensuring the client receives the best CDN service while maintaining privacy.

### Pseudonymizing Registry (PR) and Pseudonymizing Optimizer (PO)

- **Pseudonymizing Registry (PR)**: Manages the mapping between OI and PI. It is highly synchronized for data consistency and limits access to authorized POs to protect privacy.
- **Pseudonymizing Optimizer (PO)**: Interacts with the Internet application provider to generate optimal results. It looks up the PI to obtain the OI and selects the optimal replica server based on the client's location and other relevant information.

### Internet Application Provider

Before serving requests for PIC-aware services, the Internet application provider must subscribe to the pseudonymous optimization service from the PO. The provider should deliver all necessary information for OI-based optimization, excluding the OI itself. The communication of this information can be done either on-the-fly or pre-configured, depending on the size and variability of the data.

By using the PIC service, the client can experience optimal CDN service while keeping its privacy intact.
