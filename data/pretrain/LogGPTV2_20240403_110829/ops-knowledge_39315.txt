User: I am running some code that has X workers, each worker pulling tasks from a queue every second. For this I use twisted's task.LoopingCall() function. Each worker fulfills its request (scrape some data) and then pushes the response back to another queue. All this is done in the reactor thread since I am not deferring this to any other thread.
I am wondering whether I should run all these jobs in separate threads or leave them as they are. And if so, is there a problem if I call task.LoopingCall every second from each thread ?
Assistant: You shouldn't use threads for that. Doing it all in the reactor thread is ok. If your scraping uses twisted.web.client to do the network access, it shouldn't block, so you will go as fast as it gets.
