SIGCOMM ’21, August 23–27, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
A APPENDICES
Appendices are supporting material that has not been peer-reviewed.
A.1 IP-to-AS Mapping
To address the challenge of mapping IP addresses to ASes with high
accuracy and coverage, we combine data from two well-known pub-
licly available datasets, namely RIPE RIS [78] and RouteViews [82].
These datasets contain control-plane information of BGP announce-
ments (BGP RIBs and updates), enabling the mapping of an AS (or
more than one ASes in Multi-Origin/MOAS cases) to the IP prefixes
that they announce in BGP. In compliance with the timeline of
our study, we obtain more than 7 years (October 2013 - April 2021)
of daily data from each dataset. We aggregate them in monthly
snapshots and we filter out reserved IP prefixes [57] and ASes [58].
Moreover, since some of the information (such as the origin AS
of the prefix) seen in BGP might be “tainted”, e.g., due to BGP
hijacks [93] or route leaks [94], we preserve only the IP-to-AS map-
pings that consistently appeared for more than 25% of the total time
per monthly snapshot (i.e., more than a week – less than 2% of BGP
hijacks last longer than a week according to [109]). We then merge
the two datasets. In case they contain conflicting information on
the AS mapping for the same prefix, we consider all associated ASes
as valid mappings and treat the case as BGP MOAS. This process
results in a coverage of 75.8% of the publicly routable IPv4 address
space, on average across time.
A.2 On-Net Hypergiant Footprint
To identify the AS(es) of each HG, i.e., the on-net HG footptint,
throughout the 7-year duration of our study, we use the CAIDA
AS Organizations dataset [20]. CAIDA uses WHOIS information
available from Regional and National Internet Registries to infer
mappings of ASes to the organizational entities that operate them.
AS-to-organization mappings are available every quarter from Oct.
2009 onwards, fully covering our study timeline. In order to extract
the HG ASes across time, we are interested in the reverse mapping
(organization-to-AS(es)), since we only know the HG’s organization
name. We track organization IDs (which may change across time)
by parsing corresponding organization name literals, which we
