Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) can support customer anonymity when desired. In the future, privacy features are likely to be integrated into the IT infrastructure as part of application platforms.

The primary challenge in adopting PETs is the general public's poor understanding of privacy issues. Without this understanding, there is little demand for PETs and no strong drivers for the evolution of privacy solutions. Many users do not perceive the value of privacy because they have not experienced the consequences of losing it.

However, awareness of privacy issues is increasing. The rise in identity theft (as seen in the United States and increasingly in Europe) is motivating citizens to take a more active role in protecting their personal data.

Conversely, the increase in terror threats has shifted public opinion on privacy. Most people now accept increased public control, sacrificing their privacy for personal security. Citizens generally trust public authorities and do not expect abuse from them.

Market acceptance of PETs is expected to be polarized, driven by different consumer attitudes. The majority trusts the authorities and does not prioritize privacy in daily life, while a small minority is concerned about their privacy and seeks protection when using electronic services.

Our research suggests that a natural first step towards better privacy protection would be to support and encourage the use of informational privacy tools to create and implement privacy policies on public and private websites. This could raise broad awareness of privacy issues and pave the way for more operational privacy solutions.

Secondly, introducing common principles for identity management with integrated privacy features could support the introduction of privacy management tools in selected areas where users see a benefit from simplified data access and control procedures.

Establishing legal requirements for PETs in specific situations is challenging without a systematic approach. Additional research is needed to define privacy requirements precisely and consistently, forming a basis for legislation. The fact that private data easily crosses borders further complicates matters, as even within Europe, legislation struggles with cross-border privacy concerns.

In Europe, the EU privacy directive has been widely implemented in national legislation, regulating the exchange of private data between public administrations. While the directive builds on earlier sources such as the OECD privacy principles, it does not provide a comprehensive conceptual framework. International cooperation in the privacy field is expected to be most useful in areas of research and development of common terminologies and concepts for classifying private data, issues, and usage scenarios.

#### 3. PROTECTING PRIVACY

##### 3.1 WHAT IS PRIVACY?

Over a century ago, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis defined privacy as "the right to be let alone," which he described as one of the rights most cherished by Americans. However, the concept of being "let alone" no longer suffices to define privacy in today's digital environment, where electronic communication is widely used in interactions with other individuals, businesses, and public institutions. Today, privacy refers to the individual's ability to protect information about themselves from being exposed to others.

Many types of information are generally considered private, such as health data, financial records, and records of religious or political beliefs. Depending on the context, even seemingly trivial information like shopping patterns, phone call details, or geographical positions can be highly sensitive.

A key aspect of privacy is the potential to link different pieces of information. Combining data from various sources can violate an individual's privacy, even if each piece of information is harmless on its own. This is possible when two or more sources use the same unique identifier, such as a social security number. When information sources use the same identifier, there is a risk that the data can be combined, potentially violating privacy.

For this reason, the identifier fields of personal information are often considered the most sensitive and are protected in the name of privacy. However, any information related to an individual can be used to trace personal information by linking different sources. Linking fields could include telephone numbers, street addresses, or even shoe sizes. While not all these fields are unique identifiers, combining several factors often enables the unique identification of an individual, making it possible to combine the information.

Protecting privacy often focuses on minimizing the collection and storage of information and deleting it as soon as it has served its purpose. However, these principles are challenged by the need for convenient electronic services, such as eBusiness and eGovernment transactions. The value of these services often depends on secure identification and access to relevant background information about the individual.

Whether personal information is physically controlled by the individual or resides with trusted third parties, business partners, or authorities, protection often requires electronic tools that control access and use of the information according to the individual's decision.

A wide range of tools and technologies have been developed to enhance the privacy of electronic solutions, primarily targeting Internet-based communications and transactions. The purpose of these Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) is to protect the privacy of individuals while still enabling them to interact with other parties in a modern society using electronic communications.

##### 3.2 HOW IS PRIVACY RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY?

The concept of "Information Security" has many meanings. When we express a need for security, it reflects anticipated threats we want to be protected against, such as loss of information, unauthorized data changes, or exposure of secret information. Depending on the threat, different measures are employed, such as backup copies, encryption, or access control.

The requirement for privacy is the specific need to protect the confidentiality of personal information. General security measures support both privacy and other security needs. Loss of privacy is just one of many threats to personal information, so the privacy requirement must be considered alongside other information security requirements.

Some Privacy Enhancing Technologies included in this study can be used for purposes other than protecting privacy. They are general tools supporting multiple security aspects, such as confidentiality or integrity, while also protecting the privacy of the information owner. However, this report will focus on privacy-related threats and the technologies used to guard against them.

##### 3.3 WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY THREATS?

It is often argued that loss of privacy is not a problem for individuals who have nothing to hide. However, displaying personal details in the public space can have many adverse effects. Given the ease and value of collecting information about individuals through today's electronic infrastructure, any exposed personal information can be exploited. The main threats fall into three categories: A) Loss of confidentiality, B) Identity theft, and C) Unsolicited messages (spam).

A) **Loss of Confidentiality – Abuse of Personal Information:**
Just as physical intrusion into a home or private area can be offensive, the intrusion into personal electronic records or the exposure of personal information is often considered an offense or a threat to the individual.

B) **Identity Theft:**
In many situations, such as healthcare services or financial transactions, a simple token of identity, like a social security number (in Denmark: CPR number), is accepted as the sole proof of identity. This is convenient but opens up the possibility of fraud based on false identity. The risks include financial loss from transactions supported by the stolen identity token and exposure of information accessible with the token. Identity theft can have even worse consequences, such as obtaining false certificates, passports, driver's licenses, and credit cards. Since last year, there have been more instances of criminals setting up fake websites of financial institutions and tricking people, often via email, to reveal their confidential information. This type of identity theft is often called "phishing" and poses a significant threat to the targeted individual.

C) **Unsolicited Messages (Spam):**
Perhaps the most visible driver for privacy protection is the fight against unsolicited electronic messages (spam). Unlike the physical world, where addressing individuals incurs significant costs (e.g., postage or work effort), most electronic media have almost no transaction cost, making them ideal for mass mailing of commercial offers. Email on the Internet is the most common vehicle for sending spam, but other communication channels, such as conferencing systems, weblogs, short message service (SMS), and newsgroups, are also abused for this purpose.

Various methods, technologies, and products have been developed to protect individuals from these threats by hiding their identity, controlling access to their private information, deleting sensitive information, or blocking (filtering) unwanted messages. Many of these tools are generally called Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), but there is currently no widely accepted definition of PETs.

The main purpose of this analysis is to propose a high-level classification of Privacy Enhancing Technologies, along with a corresponding classification of the most significant products on the market and their features.

#### 4. CHARTING THE PET LANDSCAPE

It is generally recognized that the use of information technology can create problems for privacy protection because electronic media have different attributes than traditional paper documents. Electronic information is no longer bound to one physical place; it can be copied, moved, or changed without trace. Protecting electronic information from exposure, alteration, or loss was not a major design criterion for the networks, hardware, and software that currently contain and process our personal data. Some features have been added since the early days of the Internet to improve data protection, but the core design of the network still has serious flaws that can be exploited to gather private information and carry out fraudulent operations.

META Group’s research revealed a broad consensus on the need for privacy and a general recognition that the design of today’s IT systems and networks poses a serious challenge to privacy. The public IT infrastructure should be designed or redesigned to put the user in control of their personal information and private sphere. However, given the extent of the infrastructure and the considerable commercial and state interests in collecting personal data, this will not happen overnight. In the meantime, a number of Privacy Enhancing Technologies can be used to improve privacy protection in selected areas and cases.

Currently, no widely accepted definition of Privacy Enhancing Technologies has been established, and our research indicates that today’s view of privacy-related tools is much broader than the definitions stated a decade ago. The widespread use of electronic information and the interconnection of IT systems in public networks have created a broad range of privacy threats and corresponding opportunities for providers of privacy-related tools and services. Some of these tools are actively involved in information storage and transport, while others support the administration of privacy. The following table proposes two main categories of Privacy Enhancing Technologies and describes several subclasses:

| Main Category | Subclasses | Typical Features |
|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **Privacy Protection** | Pseudonymizer Tools | Enabling e-business transactions without requiring private information. |
| | Anonymizer Products and Services | Providing browsing and email capability without revealing the user’s address and identity. |
| | Encryption Tools | Protecting email, documents, and transactions from being read by other parties. |
| | Filters and Blockers | Preventing unwanted email and web content from reaching the user. |
| | Track and Evidence Erasers | Removing electronic traces of the user’s activity. |
| **Privacy Management** | Informational Tools | Creating and checking Privacy Policies. |
| | Administrative Tools | Managing user identity and permissions. |

#### 4.1 PRIVACY PROTECTION

Privacy Enhancing Technologies are divided into two main categories: Privacy Protection and Privacy Management. The first category, Privacy Protection, includes tools and technologies that actively protect privacy, such as by hiding private information or eliminating the need for personal identification. This category is divided into the following subclasses:

**Pseudonymizer Tools:**
The best way to protect private data in electronic services is to include privacy requirements in the basic design of the service and the architecture of the IT systems built to support it. A wide range of general design tools can be used to develop privacy-aware services and systems, but these tools are seldom marketed as privacy tools and are generally not considered Privacy Enhancing Technologies. If privacy principles were not included in the original design of data structures and services, add-on products or middleware can separate sensitive private data from transactions. Such tools or modules are often offered in connection with e-business software as a "privacy feature." The provided functionality typically replaces the name of a customer with a neutral transaction identifier, thus ensuring that the customer's identity remains anonymous.
