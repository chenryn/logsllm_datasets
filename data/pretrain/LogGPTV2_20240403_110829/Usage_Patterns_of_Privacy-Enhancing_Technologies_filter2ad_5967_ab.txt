customer anonymity, when the customer prefers it. In the future, privacy features are likely to 
be integrated in the IT infrastructure, as a part of the application platforms. 
The most significant problem for the adoption of Privacy Enhancing Technologies is the poor 
understanding  of  privacy  issues  in  the  general  public.  Without  this  understanding,  there  is 
little demand for PETs, and no strong drivers for the evolution of privacy solutions. Many 
users  have  no  perception  of  the  value  of  privacy,  because  they  have  not  experienced  the 
consequences of loosing it.  
But awareness for privacy issues is clearly rising. A factual rise in abuse of identities (as it is 
currently  happening  in  the  United  States,  and  increasingly  also  in  Europe)  is  motivating 
citizens to more personal involvement in guarding their private data. 
However, the increase in terror threats has influenced the public opinion of privacy in the 
opposite  direction:  Most  people  will  now  accept  increased  public  control,  sacrificing  their 
privacy  for  the  purpose  of  personal  security.  The  citizens  generally  have  high  trust  in  the 
public authorities and are not expecting abuse from this side.  
Market  acceptance  of  privacy  enhancing  technologies  is  expected  to  be  polarized  in  the 
future, driven by different consumer attitudes: The majority trusts the authorities and doesn’t 
care  about  privacy  in  their  daily  life,  while  a  small  minority  will  be  worried  about  their 
privacy, and look for privacy protection, when using electronic services. 
Our research indicates, that a natural first step towards better protection of privacy would be 
to support and encourage the use of the informational privacy tools to create and implement 
privacy  policies  on  public  and  private  web  sites.  This  could  create  the  required  broad 
awareness of privacy issues, and lead the way for more operational privacy solutions. 
Secondly, introducing common principles for identity management – with integrated privacy 
features  –  could  support  the  introduction  of  privacy  management  tools  in  selected  areas, 
where the user perceives a benefit from simplified data access and control procedures. 
Establishing legal requirements for PET in specific situations is difficult without a systematic 
approach – additional research in this field is required, before the privacy requirements can 
be defined precisely and consistently, so that they that can form basis for legislation. Further 
complicating  is  the  fact  that  private  data  easily  crosses  borders,  whereas  legislation,  even 
within Europe, is still struggling with an easy way of handling cross-border privacy concerns. 
In  Europe,  the  EU  privacy  directive  has  been  widely  implemented  in  national  legislation, 
regulating e.g. exchange of private data between public administrations. The directive builds 
on  many  earlier  sources,  such  as  the  OECD  privacy  principles,  but  it  does  not  provide  a 
comprehensive  conceptual  framework.  International  cooperation  in  the  privacy  field  is 
expected to be most useful in areas of research and development of common terminologies 
and concepts for classification of private data, issues and usage scenarios.

3  PROTECTING PRIVACY 
3.1  WHAT IS PRIVACY? 
More than a century ago, US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis defined privacy as "the 
right to be let alone", which he said was one of the rights most cherished by Americans. But 
the vision of being "let alone" no longer suffices to define the concept of privacy in today's 
digital  environment,  where  electronic  communication  is  widely  used  in  the  individual’s 
interaction with other individuals, businesses and public institutions. Today, privacy refers to 
the  ability  of  the  individual  to  protect  information  about  him  from  being  exposed  to  other 
parties. 
Many kinds of information are generally considered private by nature, typical examples of 
sensitive  private  information  are  health  data,  financial  data  and  records  of  religious  or 
political conviction. But, depending on the context, even trivial information such as shopping 
patterns, phone call information or geographical position can be highly sensitive. 
A  key  element  in  privacy  is  the  possibility  of  linking  different  pieces  of  information. 
Combining information from different sources can constitute a violation of the privacy of an 
individual, even if the information from each source is considered harmless. This is possible, 
when  two  or  more  sources  of  information  are  using  the  same  unique  identifier  in  their 
records, such as a social security number. When the information sources are using the same 
identifier (key), there is obviously a possibility that their information can be combined, and 
possibly violate the privacy of an individual. 
For  this  reason,  the  identifier  fields  of  personal  information  are  often  considered  the  most 
sensitive  part  of  the  information,  and  protected  in  the  name  of  privacy.  But  it  must  be 
understood, that any information that is related to an individual can be used to trace personal 
information  by  linking  different  information  sources.  Linking  fields  could  be  telephone 
number, street address or shoe size. Not all these fields are unique identifiers, but combining 
several  factors  will  often  enable  unique  identification  of  an  individual,  and  hence  make  it 
possible to combine the information. 
Protecting  privacy  is  often  focused  on  reducing  the  information  collected  and  stored  to  a 
minimum,  and  deleting  the  information,  as  soon  as  it  has  served  its  purpose.  But  these 
principles are challenged by the individual’s need for convenient electronic services, offered 
as eBusiness or eGovernment transactions. Here, the value of the service is often depending 
on having a secure identification of the individual, and having access to relevant background 
information about him. 
Whether  the  personal  information  is  physically  controlled  by  the  individual  –  or  it  resides 
with trusted third parties, business partners or authorities – the protection will often require 
electronic  tools  that  control  the  access  to  and  use  of  the  information,  according  to  the 
individual’s decision. 
A wide spectrum of tools and technologies have been developed to enhance the privacy of 
electronic  solutions,  most  of  these  are  targeting  Internet  based  communications  and 
transactions. The purpose of these Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), is to protect the 
privacy of individuals,  while still enabling them to interact with other parties in  a modern 
society, using electronic communications.

3.2  HOW IS PRIVACY RELATED TO INFORMATION SECURITY? 
The concept of “Information Security” is used in many different meanings. When we express 
a need for security, the statement reflects one or more anticipated threats that we want to be 
protected against. It could be loss of information, unauthorized data changes - or exposure of 
secret  information.  Depending  on  the  anticipated  threat,  we  employ  different  measures  to 
protect our information, such as backup copies, encryption or access control. 
The requirement of privacy is the specific need for protection against loss of confidentiality 
for person related information. A number of general security measures are supporting privacy 
as well as other security needs. Loss of privacy is only one of many threats to our personal 
information,  hence  the  privacy  requirement  must  be  seen  in  connection  with  other 
requirements to information security. 
Some of the Privacy Enhancing Technologies that are included in this study can be used for 
other  purposes  than  the  protection  of  privacy.  They  are  general  tools,  supporting  multiple 
security  aspects,  such  as  confidentiality  or  integrity,  while  at  the  same  time  protecting  the 
privacy  of  the  information  owner.  However,  in  this  report  we  will  focus  on  the  privacy 
related threats, and the technologies used to guard us against them. 
3.3  WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY THREATS? 
It is often argued, that loss of privacy is not representing a problem for individuals that have 
nothing  to  hide:  Displaying  personal  details  in  the  public  space,  however,  can  have  many 
adverse effects: Due to the fact, that today’s electronic infrastructure makes it both easy and 
valuable  to  collect  information  about  individuals,  it  must  be  expected  that  any  exposed 
personal information can be exploited. Today, the main threats fall in three major classes: A) 
Loss of confidentiality, B) Identity theft , and C) Unsolicited messages (spam). 
A) Loss of confidentiality – abuse of personal information. 
In the same way as the individual can feel offended by physical intrusion to his home 
or other private areas, the intrusion into personal electronic records or the exposure of 
personal information is most often considered an offence or a threat to the individual. 
B) Identity theft. 
In many situations, such as health care services or financial transactions, a simple token 
of identity such as the social security number ( in Denmark: CPR number ) is accepted 
as the sole proof of identity. This is convenient for the citizen, but opens up the 
possibility of fraud, based on false identity. The obvious risk is financial loss caused by 
transactions supported by the stolen identity token, and exposure of information, to 
which the token gives access. But identity theft can have even worse consequences: By 
using crafted procedures, a simple identity token can be used to obtain other false 
certificates, passport, drivers license, credit cards, etc. Since last year, there are more 
and more instances where criminals set up fake websites of financial institutions and 
trick people, often via email,  to reveal their confidential information. Such identity 
theft is often also called “phishing”. Naturally, this creates a significant threat to the 
targeted individual.

C) Unsolicited messages (spam). 
Perhaps the most visible driver for privacy protection is the fight against unsolicited 
electronic messages (spam). Unlike the physical world, where addressing individuals 
have a significant cost (e.g. in terms of postage or work effort), most electronic media 
have almost no transaction cost, and is therefore ideal for mass mailing of commercial 
offers etc. The most used vehicle for sending spam is by far email on the Internet, but 
also many other communication channels are abused for this purpose, e.g. conferencing 
systems, weblogs, short message service (SMS) and newsgroups. 
A number of different methods, technologies and products have been developed to protect the 
individual from these threats, by hiding the identity of the individual, controlling the access to 
his  private  information,  deleting  the  sensitive  information  or  blocking  (filtering)  unwanted 
messages. Many of these tools are generally called Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), 
but currently, no widely accepted definition of PETs has been established.  
The  main  purpose  of  this  analysis  is  to  propose  a  high  level  classification  of  Privacy 
Enhancing Technologies, with a corresponding classification of the most significant products 
on the market and their features.

4  CHARTING THE PET LANDSCAPE 
It is generally recognized, that the use of information technology can create problems for the 
protection of privacy, because the electronic media have a different set of attributes than the 
documents of the traditional paper world: The information is no longer bound to one physical 
place,  it  can  be  copied,  moved  or  even  changed  without  trace.  Protecting  electronic 
information  from  exposure,  alteration  or  loss  has  not  been  a  major  design  criteria  for  the 
networks, hardware and software, that currently contain and process our personal data. Since 
the early days of the Internet, some features have been added to improve data protection, but 
the core design of the network still has a number of serious flaws, that can be exploited to 
gather private information, and carry out a number of fraudulent operations. 
META Group’s research revealed a broad consensus regarding the need for privacy, and a 
general recognition of the fact, that the design of today’s IT systems and networks is a serious 
challenge to privacy: The public IT infrastructure should be designed, or redesigned, to put 
the  user  in  control  of  his  own  personal  information  and  his  private  sphere.  But  given  the 
extent  of  the  infrastructure,  and  the  considerable  commercial  and  state  interests  in  the 
collection  of  personal  data,  this  will  not  happen  overnight.  In  the  meantime,  a  number  of 
Privacy Enhancing Technologies can be used to improve the protection of privacy in selected 
areas and cases. 
Currently,  no  widely  accepted  definition  of  Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies  has  been 
established,  and  our  research  indicates  that  today’s  view  of  privacy  related  tools  is  much 
wider  than  the  definitions  stated  just  a  decade  ago.  The  widespread  use  of  electronic 
information, and the interconnection of  IT systems in public networks has created a broad 
range  of  privacy  threats,  and  corresponding  opportunities  for  providers  of  privacy  related 
tools and services. Some of these tools are actively involved in the information storage and 
transport,  while  others  are  supporting  the  administration  of  privacy.  The  following  table 
proposes two main categories of Privacy Enhancing Technologies, and describes a number of 
subclasses:

4.1  PRIVACY PROTECTION 
The  Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies  are  divided  into  two  main  categories:  Privacy 
Protection  and  Privacy  Management.  The  first  category,  Privacy  Protection,  contains  tools 
and  technologies  that  are  actively  involved  in  protecting  the  privacy,  e.g.  by  hiding  the 
private information, or by eliminating the need for personal identification. This category is 
divided into the following subclasses: 
Pseudonymizer Tools 
The  best  way  to  protect  private  data  in  electronic  services  is  to  include  the  privacy 
requirement in the basic design of the service and in the architecture of the IT systems built to 
support  it.  A  wide  range  of  general  design  tools  can  be  used  to  develop  privacy-aware 
services  and  systems,  but  these  tools  are  seldom  marketed  as  privacy  tools,  and  they  are 
generally not considered privacy enhancing technologies. If the privacy principles were not 
included in the original  design of data structures and services, it is possible to use  add-on 
products or middleware, to separate sensitive private data from the transactions. Such tools or 
modules are often offered in connection with e-business software, as a “privacy feature”. The 
provided functionality is typically replacing the name of a customer with a neutral transaction
