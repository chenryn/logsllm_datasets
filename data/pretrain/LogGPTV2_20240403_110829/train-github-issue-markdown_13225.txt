To enhance user experience and provide greater flexibility, each quiz or challenge page should include options for users to navigate both forward and backward. Please ensure that the Challenge (Waypoint) page features clearly labeled "Next" and "Previous" buttons. This will allow test-takers to move freely between questions without feeling constrained, aligning with a more human-centered design approach.
