User: How do I get Tornado (or in general another server) to handle the .py files on my host, while Apache still handles the php files?
Assistant: So you have Apache as the web head and Tornado running behind it? Why not just use ProxyPass from port 80 to whatever port Tornado is running on. 
You can't get Tornado to serve the .py files like PHP can do with .php files.
