User: I've been trying to build Python from source on my mac with the Intel compiler suite (Intel Parallel Studio) and link it against Intel's MKL. 
The reason for that is that I want to use the exactly the same environment on my mac for developing Python code as on our linux cluster.
As long as I am not telling the configure script to use Intel's parallel studio, Python builds fine (configure and make: ./configure --with(out)-gcc). But as soon as I include --with-icc, or if I set the appropriate environment variables, mentioned in ./configure --help, to the Intel compilers and linkers, make fails with:
icc -c -fno-strict-aliasing -fp-model strict -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g  -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes  -I. -IInclude -I./Include   -DPy_BUILD_CORE -o Python/getcompiler.o Python/getcompiler.c
Python/getcompiler.c(27): error: expected a ";"
    return COMPILER;
           ^
compilation aborted for Python/getcompiler.c (code 2)
make: *** [Python/getcompiler.o] Error 2
I've searched everywhere, but nobody seems to be interested in building Python on a mac with intel compilers, or I am the only one who has problems with it. I've also configured my environment according to Intel's instructions: source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64, in ~/.bash_profile.
In any case, my environment is:

OS X 10.11.6
Xcode 8.1 / Build version 8B62
Intel Parallel Studio XE 2017.0.036 (C/C++, Fortran)

Thanks,

Assistant: You could edit the line in getcompiler.c that it is complaining about:
e.g. to 
return "[Intel compiler]";

If you wanted to get fancier you could add in the compiler version, using e.g. the __INTEL_COMPILER macro.
