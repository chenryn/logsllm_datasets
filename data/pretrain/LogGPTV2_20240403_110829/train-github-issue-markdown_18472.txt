  * VSCode Version: 1.1
The .tsx/.jsx auto-formatter adds an unnecessary space on the end of certain
dynamic attributes.
E.g. `` becomes `` after the file is
auto-formatted. A space is inserted after the closing parenthesis of the fn()
call.
The problem appears to be related to having parenthesis in the attribute.
E.g.  is left unchanged by auto-format. `` becomes `` (the space is inserted)
I have also observed the auto-formatter preserves the spaces in the id
attribute of ``
