User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Setup private NTP server for a local network with Ubuntu I want to setup a small NTP server with ubuntu for a local network. 
I want that time is taken only from this server and not from outsdie network servers.Also, I want to enable to send MONLIST to clients that request it. I modified the NTP.conf file but I don't think is working. Can you help me?
The server has IP address 192.168.2.2 and the client that requires time and MONLIST has IP address 192.168.3.3 
The 2 network are connected using a firewall 
Here is the ntp.conf file 

# /etc/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd; see ntp.conf(5) for help

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift

# Enable this if you want statistics to be logged.
#statsdir /var/log/ntpstats/

Assistant: Your clients are on different subnet than the NTP Server. Look in your network topology again. Maybe it is a firewall thing..! Leave 123 tcp port and 123 utp port open on both sides of your subnets or put the NTP Server on the same subnets with your clients and try again.! How are the two subnets connected together?? through a router ? or are they VLANS??? What???
