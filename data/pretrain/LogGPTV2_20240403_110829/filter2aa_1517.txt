SAFES AND CONTAINERS – 
INSECURITY DESIGN EXCELLANCE 
DESIGN DEFECTS IN SECURITY 
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE REAL 
CONSEQUENCES IN 
PROTECTING  LIVES AND 
PROPERTY 
GUN SAFES: A CASE STUDY 
♦ GUN SAFES AND PROPERTY SAFES 
ARE SOLD TO STORE WEAPONS 
♦ MANY ARE NOT SECURE 
♦ ANALYSIS OF INSECURITY 
–  Boltworks and mechanism 
–  Biometrics 
–  Key Locks 
SECURITY REPRESENTATIONS 
♦ SECURE FOR STORING WEAPONS 
♦ CERTIFIED BY CALIFORNIA DOJ 
♦ PROTECT KIDS FROM GUNS 
MANUFACTURERS, SECURITY, 
and ENGINEERING 
♦ Many manufacturers do not understand 
bypass techniques 
♦ Many imports, no security, just price 
♦ Large reputable companies sell junk 
♦ Representations that are not true by: 
–  Manufacturers 
–  Dealers 
–  Retail 
INSECURITY ENGINEERING: 
A DEFINITION 
♦  Intersection of mechanical and security engineering 
♦  Must have both mechanics and security 
♦  Must understand bypass techniques and design against at 
all stages in process 
♦  Develop a new way of thinking by Manufacturers 
♦  Problem: Engineers know how to make things work  
but not how to break them 
MYTHS ABOUT SECURITY AND 
PRODUCT DESIGN 
♦  It is patented 
♦  Engineers think the product is secure  
♦  Product has been sold for many years 
♦  No known bypass tools or techniques 
♦  Product meets or exceeds standards 
♦  Testing labs have certified the product 
♦  Government labs say its secure 
♦  No consumer complaints 
STANDARDS: THE PROBLEM 
♦  MEET ALL STANDARDS BUT THE LOCK OR 
SAFE CAN BE EASILY OPENED 
–  Standards are not up-to-date 
–  Not test for many methods of attack 
–  Consumer relies on standards for security 
–  Just because you meet standards does not mean  
the lock or safe is secure 
♦  STANDARDS CAN MISLEAD THE PUBLIC 
♦  GUN LOCK AND SAFE STANDARDS ARE 
INADEQUATE AND DO NOT PROTECT 
CALIFORNIA DOJ STANDARDS 
     ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS 
 REGULATORY GUN SAFE 
 STANDARDS - CAL DOJ 
 Section 977.50 of the CA Code of Regulations 
♦  Shall be able to fully contain firearms and provide for their 
secure storage;  
♦  Shall have a locking system consisting of at minimum a 
mechanical or electronic combination lock. The 
mechanical or electronic combination lock utilized by the 
safe shall have at least 10,000 possible combinations 
consisting of a minimum three numbers, letters, or 
symbols. The lock shall be protected by a case-hardened 
(Rc 60+) drill-resistant steel plate, or drill-resistant 
material of equivalent strength; 
 CAL DOJ STANDARDS: 
 BOLTWORK 
♦ Boltwork shall consist of a minimum of 
three steel locking bolts of at least ½ inch 
thickness that intrude from the door of the 
safe into the body of the safe or from the 
body of the safe into the door of the safe, 
which are operated by a separate handle and 
secured by the lock; 
 CAL DOJ STANDARDS: 
      CONSTRUCTION 
♦ Shall be capable of repeated use. The 
exterior walls shall be constructed of a 
minimum 12-gauge thick steel for a single-
walled safe, or the sum of the steel walls 
shall add up to at least .100 inches for safes 
with two walls. Doors shall be constructed 
of a minimum of two layers of 12-gauge 
steel, or one layer of 7-gauge steel 
compound construction; 
 CAL DOJ STANDARDS: 
 DOOR HINGES 
♦ Door hinges shall be protected to prevent 
the removal of the door. Protective features 
include, but are not limited to: hinges not 
exposed to the outside, interlocking door 
designs, dead bars, jewelers lugs and 
active or inactive locking bolts. 
 STANDARDS:  
NOT REAL-WORLD TESTS 
♦ Standards do not protect consumers 
♦ No testing of covert entry and mechanical 
bypass techniques 
♦ Not real-world testing, aka kids 
♦ Lowest common denominator for testing 
criteria was adopted for standards 
♦ Allows certification of gun safes that can be 
opened in seconds by kids 
♦ Most states rely on California as Model 
 SMALL GUN SAFES:  
 MAJOR RETAILERS 
RETAILERS DONT KNOW AND DONT 
CARE: ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY 
♦ Contacted four major retailers to warn 
♦ Only one was even concerned 
♦ No action taken by any of them 
♦ Stack-On: Absolutely no interest 
 MISREPRESENTATIONS 
 ABOUT SECURITY 
♦ California DOJ Certified 
♦ Can be relied upon as secure 
♦ Are safe to secure guns 
♦ Cannot be opened by kids 
♦ Only way to open: breaking 
♦ Can be relied upon by consumer 
♦ TSA Approved 
DEALERS MISLEAD THE 
PUBLIC ABOUT SECURITY
