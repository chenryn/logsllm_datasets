**Pre-OS USB Device Detection on DeviceVeil**

### 2) Procedure of Pre-OS USB Detection

Figure 5 illustrates the procedure for pre-OS USB device detection by the DeviceVeil hypervisor. When a USB device is inserted, a "Attach" hardware interrupt occurs. Due to BitVisorâ€™s para-pass-through architecture, the insertion is managed, and DeviceVeil disguises a dummy device until PUF (Physically Unclonable Function) authentication is completed.

After the "Attach" interrupt, the OS follows the normal procedure to detect a USB device. The OS waits for a certain period (about 100 milliseconds) and issues the "Reset" command. The USB device then enters the "default" state and can accept control commands. Subsequently, the "Set Address" command is issued from the OS to the USB device. However, this request is intercepted by DeviceVeil, which issues its own "Set Address" command to the USB device. The USB device then enters the "address" state.

DeviceVeil sends a "Get descriptor(device)" command to the device to retrieve the device descriptor (e.g., vendor ID, product ID, class ID, serial number). If the device is a registered USB-PUF device, DeviceVeil offers a dummy harmless USB keyboard to the OS and initiates the PUF authentication process. If the device is a registered non-USB-PUF device (if explicitly allowed by administrators during the transition), DeviceVeil allows para-pass-through access from the OS immediately. Otherwise, DeviceVeil just offers a dummy device to the OS.

For legitimate PUF-enabled devices, DeviceVeil allows the OS to continue the USB device recognition procedure. The OS sends "Get descriptor(device)" and "Authorized licensed use limited to: Tsinghua University. Downloaded on March 19, 2021 at 10:52:47 UTC from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply."
