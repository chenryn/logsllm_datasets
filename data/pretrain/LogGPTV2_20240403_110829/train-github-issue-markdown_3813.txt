  1. zoom in really far on the middle of a document
  2. select some text
  3. ctrl+wheel zoom out and the selected text scrolls off the screen
in visual studio and wordpad and prob others it seems to be anchored to the
top of the window while zooming so your selection and your 'focus' does not
scroll out of view
please consider adding something similar
thanks
