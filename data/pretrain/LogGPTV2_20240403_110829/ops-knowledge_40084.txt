User: Please talk about your understanding of cloud computing, how is it different from traditional IT, and how do you see the future of cloud computing?
Assistant: My understanding is that cloud computing is a technology that provides computing power and other resources on demand. What makes cloud computing different from traditional IT is that it uses virtualization technology to package hardware resources (such as computing, network, storage) into a service, which can be allocated to a wide range of applications and users on demand at any time, and these resources do not need to be pre-purchased or configuration. The future of cloud computing is bright, especially in the context of enterprise digital transformation. In the past, enterprises needed to build their own hardware infrastructure to meet business needs, which required a lot of money and time. Now, companies can use cloud computing services to get the resources they need quickly and efficiently. This can reduce IT costs for businesses and make them more flexible and agile. At the same time, it can help enterprises achieve elastic scaling of IT resources, and automatically adjust the required computing resources as business needs increase or decrease. With the continuous development and application of cloud computing technology, cloud computing will become the standard configuration of more industries and enterprises, which will change the structure and mode of traditional IT. In the future, cloud computing will become an important part of the digital transformation of enterprises and a key infrastructure supporting new technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.
