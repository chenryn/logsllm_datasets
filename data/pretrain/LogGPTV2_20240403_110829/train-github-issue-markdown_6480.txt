Hello!
Today I've returned to my computer (aarch64 macOS 13.1) and now if I run
`deno` in the terminal it hangs for about 40 seconds before the shell starts.
Once the shell it present it works and feels normal, but then the program
entirely crashes with an OOM error 5 to 10 seconds later.
    Deno 1.32.2
    exit using ctrl+d, ctrl+c, or close()
    REPL is running with all permissions allowed.
    To specify permissions, run `deno repl` with allow flags.

I have not knowningly changed my computer at all since when I last used Deno
on this machine a few days ago.
If I run `deno --log-level=debug` it prints many many lines like this before
it crashes:
    DEBUG RS - deno::npm::resolvers:144 - Resolved package folder of file:///Users/louis/Library/Caches/deno/npm/registry.npmjs.org/fp-ts/2.13.1/es6/Pointed.d.ts to /Users/louis/Library/Caches/deno/npm/registry.npmjs.org/fp-ts/2.13.1

Here is the full log: deno-log.txt
If I move `~/Library/Caches/deno/npm` to a new location it no longer crashes,
but it still takes 6 seconds to start the shell.
Here is the logs for when that happens:

Do let me know what else I can do to help debug!

edit: I mistaken when I said removing the npm cache directory fixed it, it
seems to instead be based upon what my working directory is. If I'm in my home
directory it crashes, but if I'm in the `~/Library/Caches/deno` it starts the
shell in 6 seconds and uses 2.52GB of memory at start. If I run it in a new
directory it starts near instantly and uses 54MB.
edit 2: 1.32.3 does not have this problem, but I had to manually upgrade.
`brew` doesn't have this for some reason.
