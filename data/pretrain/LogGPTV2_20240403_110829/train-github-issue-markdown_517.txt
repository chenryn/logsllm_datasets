in the following schema:
    +-------------------------------------------*
    |   people (abstract) --- has a --- car     |
    |         ^    ^                     ^      |
    |         |    |                     |      |
    | engineers    managers            offroad  |
    |                                           |
    +-------------------------------------------+
you define a ploymorphic car_mapper for car and offroad  
you define a polymorphic people_mapper for engineers and managers with a
property 'car' relation(car_mapper)
after clearing the session, if you query a Person and you retrieve his car
property (person.car), the object returned is wrong but the reference to the
car (person.car_id) is right.  
see attached test case
