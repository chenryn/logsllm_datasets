User: How do I know is there my child process got hang while operating?
Assistant: Well, how do you tell the difference between a stuck process and a process that takes longer than usual to complete? The short answer is: No, you can't detect if your child process is stuck.
I would say that to be able to detect this you need some kind of continuous communication with the process (e.g. look at log files, IPC or similar). Based on this communication you might be able to tell when and if a process is stuck.
