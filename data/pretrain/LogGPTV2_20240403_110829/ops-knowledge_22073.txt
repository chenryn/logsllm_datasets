Certainly! Here is the log converted into a more structured and professional format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2015-10-18T18:01:48.963Z",
  "date": "2015-10-18",
  "time": "18:01:48.963",
  "severity": "INFO",
  "process": "main",
  "component": "org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster",
  "message": "Executing with tokens:"
}
```

This JSON structure clearly organizes the log information, making it easier to read and process.
