Part of the class Private Properties transform is the terribly complicated
"property" to function call visitor. It's strikingly similar to the replace
supers (1, 2) transform.
That's because they're the same thing, just with different functions to call.
This needs to be extracted into a new helper visitor, so we can cut down the
duplication.
