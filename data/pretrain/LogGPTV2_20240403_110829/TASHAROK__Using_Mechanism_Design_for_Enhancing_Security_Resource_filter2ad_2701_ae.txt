investments across the network. This finding motivates the
importance of incentivizing behavioral defenders to achieve
social optimal investments since this would lead to reducing
the per-defender real cost and the social cost as shown next.
Social Costs: Figure 9a-9d demonstrate the reduction in
social cost (which is the sum of the real costs of all defenders)
following the implementation of the mechanism for the four
systems. We observe that
the mechanism design is more
helpful for moderate and highly behavioral defenders since
the behavioral investments under PNE is much worse than
the social optimal solution. Numerically, as a result of risk
reduction following the implementation of the mechanism, we
see that the gain for society (represented by the ratio of the
social cost under PNE to social cost under the mechanism) is
3X for DER, 180X for SCADA, 450X for E-commerce, and
390X for VoIP when the defenders are highly behavioral (i.e.,
α1 = α2 = 0.4). This result shows that the social cost under
the socially optimal allocation is much lower than that under
PNE, and the gap is higher for highly behavioral defenders
and for systems with higher degree of interdependency.
Defender’s Real Expected Loss: Figure 10a and 10b
illustrate the real expected losses of all defenders under both
the PNE and the socially optimal outcome (incentivized by the
mechanism). Here the social planner is made to be behavioral
along with the defenders, at the same level (same value of
α). From the result, we see that implementing the proposed
mechanisms would incentivize risk reduction for each defender
for SCADA system while keeping the risk the same for the
DER system. This happens due to the loose interdependency in
the DER system. With such loose interdependency, the social
optimality is achieved simply by the defenders individually
spending their security resources efficiently.

Externality mechanism each defender pays positive taxes.

each defender participates in the mechanism for the four studied

to participate under higher tax payment.
Tax Payment Amounts: Here, we compare tax payments
under different scenarios for both mechanisms that we study
here. First, for the DER.1 system, it has the nature that each
subnetwork is mainly affected by the corresponding defender.
Therefore, under VCG mechanism, both defenders can reach
the social optimal without paying taxes (i.e., budget balance
for the central regulator). Hence, we omit this figure. However,
for the SCADA system since the two subnetworks are mainly
interdependent (i.e., if the attacker access both subnetworks
via the Corp and the Vendor nodes, as explained earlier),
the budget balance condition is not satisfied for the VCG
mechanism. Figure 11a shows such insight where each of the
two defenders is paid by the central regulator in the VCG
mechanism since each defender makes the SCADA system
more secure by her investments. We note also that although
behavioral defenders invest suboptimally, they also benefit
other defenders in the network (reduce the social cost) and thus
need also to be paid by the VCG mechanism regulator. On the
other hand, Figure 11b shows that the budget balance condition
is satisfied with the Externality mechanism since each defender
pays for the positive externalities on her cost due to other
defender’s investments. Figure 11c-11d show similar findings
for E-commerce system due to interdependency among servers
via firewalls and internet. We omit similar tax figures for VoIP.
Amount of Taxes and Voluntary Participation: Human
bias is an important factor when trying to understand how

stakeholders would react to the security tax. Thus, we consider
next the voluntary participation of the defenders under any
quasi-linear tax-based mechanism. This requires calculation of
the maximum tax payment under which each defender would
participate in the mechanism. Figure 12 shows such maximum
tax amount for our four interdependent systems under different
behavioral levels. The highly behavioral defender is willing to
participate in the mechanism even under higher tax payments
since her suboptimal investments are far from the socially
optimal level. For her, paying higher taxes and allocating
resources according to the social optimum would yield lower
total real loss compared to opting out and achieving PNE.
Asymmetry in Security Budget Distribution Across
Defenders: We now study the effect of asymmetry in security
budget distribution across the defenders and its effect on
social cost. Figure 13a and 13b show the results for the
DER and SCADA systems, respectively. For both systems, we
observe that the social cost is higher with very high budget
asymmetry and moderate to high behavioral level (i.e., one
defender has 10% of the total security budget and the second
defender has the remaining 90%). This observation can be
explained by two facts. First, with a suboptimal behavioral
allocation, the defender that has much less security budget
wastes her constrained budget on non-critical edges. Second,
the much richer behavioral player also allocates her resources
suboptimally. This leads to this magnified increase in the social
cost under extreme budget asymmetry. We observe similar
findings for E-commerce and VoIP systems (Figures omitted).
Number of Defenders: We create a network with multiple
defenders that contains replicas of these two subnetworks, and
assume that new installed equipment corresponds to a new
defender’s subnetwork. We consider a symmetric distribution
of the security budget over all defenders, with each defender
having same security budget. Figure 16 shows that as the
number of defenders increases, the difference between total
losses between non-behavioral and behavioral games increases
in a super-linear manner. For instance, when the number of
defenders is 4, a change from non-behavioral to behavioral
defenders (α = 0.6) increases the loss by 8.65%, while the
same change in α in the larger network with 16 defenders
results in a substantial increase of 26.17%. This is due to the
interdependencies between the subnetworks. For instance, if
there are two defenders, each will incur a loss in two cases:
when either her target asset is successfully compromised or
the other defender’s target asset is successfully compromised
(as it can lead to the compromise of their common goal G).

there are 16 possible paths through which she suffers a loss.
This also explains why the total loss in the system increases
as the number of defenders increases—the individual budget
of each defender stays the same but the number of ways in
which her asset can be compromised increases linearly.
Asymmetry of Cognitive Bias across Defenders: We study
the effect of the asymmetry in cognitive bias across different
defenders, in contrast to the previous experiments where both
defenders had the same behavioral bias. Figure 17a-17b (in
Appendix F) shows the effect of such heterogeneity on the
social cost. We observe that two defenders with moderate
behavioral levels (α1 = 0.6, α2 = 0.6) would invest better
and consequently reduce the social cost more compared to two
heterogeneous defenders (with α1 = 0.8, α2 = 0.4), although
the mean behavioral level is the same in the two cases.
Sensitivity of Edges to Investments: Finally, we show the
effect of edges’ sensitivity to investments on each defender’s
real expected loss for different behavioral levels. We present
this experiment in Appendix F. The high-level takeaway is
that a defender whose edge is more sensitive to investments
(i.e., the probability of successful attack goes down faster) gets
more tax payments under the mechanisms.
D. Baseline Systems
We compare TASHAROK with four baseline systems
under rational defenders: the seminal work of [12] for security
investment with attack graphs on attack graph generation
and investment decision analysis8, [38] for placing security
resources using defense in depth technique which traverses
all edges that can be used to compromise each critical asset
and distribute resources equally on them, the recent work [25]
that explored behavioral decision-making in a non-cooperative
setup (PNE characterization), and the recent work [9] that
showed that attackers follow shorter paths to exploit target
assets in the generated attack graphs. Table I shows such
comparison by calculating the social cost under each work’s
defense allocation, indicating the superiority of TASHAROK
for almost all our interdependent systems (note similar results
between our proposed approach and most baselines for DER.1
in Table I due to the weak interdependency in this system).
Since three of the four baselines (except [25]) do not design
for behavioral defenders, we do not consider such defenders in
this experiment. The result bears out the fact that the defense
investments given by [25] and [12] are identical under rational
decision-making.
TABLE I: Comparison of TASHAROK and baseline systems in
terms of the social cost under each system’s defense allocation
(lower is better). For TASHAROK, we consider a rational social
planner. TASHAROK gives the best defense allocation among the
techniques (resp. the lowest social cost).

VII. RELATED WORK
Game-theoretic modeling of security: Game theory has
been used to describe the interactions between attackers and
defenders and their effects on system security. A commonly
used model in this context is that of two-player games, where a
single attacker attempts to compromise a system controlled by
a single defender [64], [65]. Game theoretic models have also
been used in [14], [66], [67] to study the interaction between
one defender and (multiple) attackers attempting Distributed
Denial of Service attacks. Our work differs from both of
these lines of literature by considering the interdependencies
between multiple defenders in the network. Game theoretic
models have also been used to study critical infrastructure
security [13], [68], censorship-resilient proxy distribution [15],
and protecting networks from cascade attacks [69], [70]. The
major difference of our work is that we analyze behavioral
models of decision-making while existing work has focused on
classical game-theoretic models of rational decision-making.
Moreover, previous research does not consider mechanism
designs to improve security as we do here.
Human behavior
in security and privacy: Notable
departures from classical economic models within the privacy
literature are [41], [71], which identify the effects of behavioral
decision-making on personal privacy choices. The importance
of considering similar models in the study of system security
has been recognized in the literature [60], [72]. Prior work
considers models from behavioral economics in the context of
security applications, but based only on psychological studies
[42], [73] and human subject experiments [74], [75], [30]
for the end user. Our work differs by exploring a rigorous
mathematical model of decision-makers’ behavior. We also
model the interaction between multiple defenders (in contrast
to only one defender in these studies), consider interdependent
assets (in contrast to studies that examine binary decisions for
isolated assets), and study the mechanism design for enhancing
security decision-making of behavioral defenders (in contrast
to these studies that did not consider any mitigation).
A few studies provide theoretical
treatment of behavioral
decision-making in specific classes of interdependent security
games [33], [32], [76]. These works, however do not consider
any mitigation for behavioral decision-making.
Mechanism design in security: The motivation for
considering mechanism design models in the security literature
comes from two main characteristics of security games with
multiple defenders. First, the security investments of each
defender can help other defenders, similar to public good
provision with positive externalities. Second, defenders can
therefore free ride and depend on security investments by
other defenders. This leads to an inefficiently low overall
security level of the system [35], [36]. This motivates the
study of mechanisms for improving network security, and
ideally, incentivizing user cooperation and driving the system
to a socially optimal state of enhanced overall security,
e.g., [37], [46]. However,
to the best of our knowledge,
no previous work in mechanism design has investigated

behavioral decision-making effects and considered attack
graphs that can model any large-scale interdependent system.
Our presented impossibility result differs from those in the
existing literature, which builds on the seminal work of Green
and Laffont [77]. We differ in terms of the selected equilibrium
solution concept,
the set of properties the mechanism is
required to satisfy, the space of cost functions, or the nature of
the system type. For instance, the Myerson and Satterthwaite
result [36] considers a Bayesian Nash solution while we have a
Pure Nash implementation. On the other hand, Maskin’s work
on implementation theory [78] considers Nash equilibrium
for the complete information setup. However it requires that
all NE be socially optimal which cannot be guaranteed in
interdependent security games (see Section IV). Finally, the
line of work [37], [46] has considered quasi-linear costs (where
the tax is added to the original cost function) and Nash
equilibrium solutions of the mechanisms, which has two main
differences from our present work. First, they consider utilities
with classical decision-making models, without the cognitive
biases that we consider here. Second, they do not consider
interdependent systems with attack graphs.
VIII. DISCUSSION
(1) Existence of bias in security decision-makers: Numerous
academic studies of even the most highly-trained specialists
have shown that experts are also susceptible to systematic
failures of human cognition (e.g., [79], [80]). Specifically,
the work [80] has conducted a survey of experiments that
considered behavior of students against experts in a wide
variety of professions. This survey reports only one out of
thirteen considered studies found that professionals make
decisions more closely in line with standard economic
theory. Moreover, recent research has shown that cybersecurity
professionals’ probability perceptions are as susceptible to
systematic biases as those of the general population [27], [28].
Finally, even if security experts exhibit weaker biases, this can
still result in sub-optimal security investments and their effects
may be magnified due to the magnitude of losses associated
with compromised real-world assets that these experts control.
(2) Guiding security decision-makers: We acknowledge that
the security state of a system cannot be fully summarized by
only one measure. However, we believe that our framework
provides an important estimate of the probability of successful
attack (resp. expected financial
loss). We compose that
estimate from something that is easier to grasp — the loss due
to each asset in the system being compromised. We believe
that our work opens up a new dimension of intervention
in securing interdependent systems. Our framework allows
for a quantification of the improvements in security that
can be obtained by incentivizing security professionals to
invest better via our proposed mechanisms. Furthermore, this
framework can guide operators of large-scale interdependent
systems (akin to social planners), by allowing the operator to
investigate subsystems within the system where sub-optimal
security investments might have been made by subordinates
operating those subsystems and by calculating the taxes
charged to each subordinate to participate in the mechanism
and enhance overall system security (social cost). As shown in
Section VI, this would depend on the nature of the network and
the interdependency among different defenders. We emphasize
that our focus in this paper is to explore the benefit of such
mechanism for human decision-makers with cognitive biases
securing interdependent systems and explore its outcomes.
(3) Mechanism design to solve behavioral bias
in
different security problems: Our proposed adaptation of
the Externality and VCG mechanisms to interdependent
security games (Section V) can be further used for different
security problems. Examples include defending isolated assets
with heterogeneous valuations, e.g., for enhancing security
decisions to defend different airports [81] or preventing
DAG-based ransomware attacks [82]. Recent work has shown
the effect of cognitive biases on security resource allocations in
such settings using decision- and game-theoretic analysis [76],
[33]. However, these studies do not consider any mitigation for
such biases. Thus, using mechanism design to improve such
biases would be an avenue for future work.
