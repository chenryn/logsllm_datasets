ABSTRACT 
Network  based  intruders  seldom  attack  directly  from  their  own 
hosts, but rather stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping 
stones” to conceal their identity and origin. To identify attackers 
behind  stepping  stones,  it  is  necessary  to  be  able  to  correlate 
connections  through  stepping  stones,  even  if  those  connections 
are encrypted or perturbed by the intruder to prevent traceability. 
The timing-based approach is the most capable and promising 
current  method  for  correlating  encrypted  connections.  However, 
previous timing-based approaches are vulnerable to packet timing 
perturbations introduced by the attacker at stepping stones.  
In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based correlation 
scheme  that  is  designed  specifically  to  be  robust  against  timing 
perturbations. The watermark is introduced by slightly adjusting 
the  timing  of  selected  packets  of  the  flow.  By  utilizing 
redundancy  techniques,  we  have  developed  a  robust  watermark 
correlation framework that reveals a rather surprising result on the 
inherent  limits  of  independent  and  identically  distributed  (iid) 
random timing perturbations over sufficiently long flows. We also 
identify the tradeoffs between timing perturbation characteristics 
and achievable correlation effectiveness.  Experiments show that 
the  new  method  performs  significantly  better  than  existing, 
passive,  timing-based  correlation  in  the  presence  of  random 
packet timing perturbations.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
Network  based  attacks  have  become  a  serious  threat  to  the 
critical  information  infrastructure  on  which  we  depend.  Those 
charged  with  defending  networked  assets  that  are  under  attack 
would  like  very  much  to  be  able  to  identify  the  source  of  the 
attack,  so  that  appropriate  action  can  be  taken  (whether  that  be 
contacting 
the 
attacker’s  traffic, litigation, or criminal prosecution).  Attackers, 
however,  go  to  some  lengths  to  conceal  their  identities,  using  a 
variety of countermeasures.  As an example, they may spoof the 
IP  source  address  of  their  traffic.    Methods  of  tracing  spoofed 
traffic, generically referred to as IP traceback[6,11,13], have been 
developed to address this countermeasure. 
the  source  network  administrator,  filtering 
Another  common  and  effective  countermeasure  used  by 
network-based  intruders  to  hide  the  origin  of  their  traffic  is  to 
connect  through  a  sequence  of  stepping  stones[14,15,20]  before 
attacking the final target. For example, an attacker at host A may 
Telnet  or  SSH  into  host  B,  and  from  there  launch  an  attack  on 
host  C.  In  effect,  incoming  packets  of  an  attack  connection  or 
flow  from  A  to  B  are  forwarded  by  B,  and  become  outgoing 
packets  of  a  connection  from  B  to  C.   The two connections are 
said to be related in this case.  The victim at host C can use IP 
traceback  to  determine  the  attack  comes  from  host  B,  but 
traceback will not be able to determine the attack originated from 
host A.  To trace attacks through a stepping stone, it is necessary 
to correlate incoming traffic at the stepping stone with outgoing 
traffic  at  the  stepping  stone.  This  would  allow  the  attack  to  be 
traced back to host A in the example. 
The  earliest  work  on  connection  correlation  was  based  on 
tracking  users’  login  activities  at  different  hosts  [7,12].    Later 
work relied on comparing the packet contents, or payloads, of the 
connections  to  be  correlated  [14,17].  Most  recent  work  has 
focused on the timing characteristics [16,19,20] of connections, in 
order  to  correlate  encrypted  connections  (i.e.  traffic  encrypted 
using IPSEC[8] or SSH [10,18]). 
This work was supported by DARPA contract F30602-99-1-0540. 
The  views  and  conclusion  contained  herein  are  those  of  the 
authors. 
20Existing timing-based correlation approaches, are vulnerable to 
countermeasures  by  the  attacker.  In  particular,  the  attacker  can 
perturb the timing characteristics of a connection by selectively or 
randomly introducing extra delays when forwarding packets at the 
stepping  stone.  This  kind  of  timing  perturbation  will  adversely 
affect  the  effectiveness  of  any  timing-based  correlation.  The 
timing  perturbation  could  either  make  unrelated  flows  have 
similar  timing  characteristics,  or  make  related  flows  exhibit 
different timing characteristics.  Either case could cause a timing-
based correlation method to fail. 
In  this  paper,  we  address  the  random  timing  perturbation 
problem  in  correlating  encrypted  connections  through  stepping 
stones. Our goal is to develop a practical correlation scheme that 
is  robust  against  random  timing  perturbation,  and  to  answer 
fundamental questions concerning the maximum effectiveness of 
such  techniques,  and  the  tradeoffs  involved  in  implementing 
them.  
We  propose  a  novel  watermark-based  connection  correlation 
method  that  is  designed  to  be  robust  against  random  timing 
perturbations by the attacker. The idea is to actively embed some 
unique watermark into the flow by slightly adjusting the timing of 
selected packets in the flow. If the embedded watermark is unique 
enough and robust against timing perturbation by the attacker, the 
watermarked flow can be uniquely identified, and thus effectively 
correlated.  By  utilizing  a  redundant  watermark,  we  have 
developed  a  robust  correlation  scheme  which  can  achieve  a 
detection  (true  positive)  rate  arbitrarily  close  to  100%,  and  a 
watermark  collision  (false  positive)  rate  arbitrarily  close  to  0  at 
the same time.  This can be accomplished for an arbitrarily large 
(but  bounded)  independent  and  identically  distributed  (iid) 
random  timing  perturbation  of  arbitrary  distribution,  with  an 
arbitrarily  small  adjustment  of  inter-packet  timing,  as  long  as 
there are enough packets in the flow to be watermarked. 
The  contributions  of  this  paper  are  as  follows.  First,  we 
demonstrate  that  a  previously-proposed  passive,  timing-based 
correlation  scheme  is  vulnerable  to  random  timing  perturbation. 
Second,  we  develop  a  practical  watermark-based  correlation 
scheme  that  is  much  more  robust  in  the  presence  of  random 
timing perturbations. Our experimental results show that the new 
method  consistently  has  a  higher  detection  (true  positive)  rate, 
whether  there  is  random  timing  perturbation  or  not.  Third,  we 
prove that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily close to 100% true 
positive correlation rate and arbitrarily close to 0% false positive 
correlation rate at the same time, at least in theory, for sufficiently 
long flows under certain conditions. Lastly, we develop accurate 
models of the tradeoffs between the desired watermark correlation 
true  positive  rate  (and  false  positive  rate)  and  the  watermark 
embedding  parameters,  as well as the defining characteristics of 
the  random  timing  perturbation.  The  quantitative  expression  of 
the  tradeoffs  is  of  significant  practical importance in optimizing 
the overall correlation effectiveness under a range of conditions. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
summarizes previous work. Section 3 overviews watermark-based 
correlation.  Section  4  describes  the basic embedding of a single 
watermark  bit  in  the  inter-packet  timing  domain.  Section  5 
presents  a  probabilistically-robust  watermark  bit  embedding. 
Section  6  analyzes  the  watermark  bit  robustness  and  tradeoffs. 
Section  7  analyzes 
the  overall  watermark  detection  and 
watermark  collision.  Section  8  evaluates 
the  correlation 
effectiveness of our method experimentally. Section 9 concludes 
the paper, and describes future research directions.  
2.  PREVIOUS RELATED WORK 
Existing connection correlation approaches are based on three 
different  characteristics:  1)  host  activity;  2)  connection  content 
(i.e.,  packet  payloads);  and  3)  connection  (packet)  timing.    The 
host  activity  approach  (e.g.,  CIS[7]  and  DIDS[12])  collects  and 
tracks  user 
login  activities  at  each  stepping  stone.  The 
fundamental problem of host activity approaches is that the user 
login  activity  information  collected  from  stepping  stones  is  not 
trustworthy.  Since the attacker is  assumed to have full control 
over each stepping stone, the attacker can easily modify, delete, 
or forge local user login information.  This defeats the ability to 
perform correlation based on host activity.

connection 
Approaches 
(e.g.,  
Thumbprinting[14] and SWT[17]) require that payload content be 
invariant  across  stepping  stones.  Since  the  attacker  can  encrypt 
the flows that pass through the stepping stones, and thus modify 
the  connection  contents,  this  approach  is  limited  to unencrypted 
connections. 
content 
Connection  timing  based  approaches  (e.g.,  IPD-based[16], 
Deviation-based[19]  and  ON/OFF-based[20])  use  the  arrival 
and/or  departure  times  of  packets  to  correlate  connections.  For 
example, IPD-based correlation [16] has shown that 1) the inter-
packet timing characteristics of connections are preserved across 
many  router  hops  and  stepping  stones;  and  2)  the  timing 
characteristics  of  telnet  and  SSH  connections  are  almost  always 
unique  enough  to  provide  correct  correlation  across  stepping 
stones. 
While  timing-based  correlation  is  currently  the  most  capable 
timing-based 
and  promising  correlation  approach,  existing 
correlation schemes are vulnerable to the attacker’s use of active 
timing perturbation. Donoho et al. [5] have recently investigated 
the theoretical limits on the attacker’s ability to disguise his traffic 
through timing perturbation and packet padding (i.e., injection of 
bogus  packets).  They  show  that  correlation  from  the  long  term 
behavior  (of  sufficiently  long  flows)  is  still  possible  despite 
certain timing perturbations by the attacker. However, they do not 
present  any  tradeoffs  between  the  magnitude  of  the  timing 
perturbation, the desired correlation effectiveness, and the number 
of packets needed. Another important issue that is not addressed 
by [5] is the correlation false positive rate. While the coarse scale 
analysis  for  long  term  behavior  may  filter  out  packet  jitter 
introduced  by  the  attacker,  it  could  also  filter  out  the  inherent 
uniqueness and details of the flow timing. Therefore coarse scale 
analysis tends to increase the correlation false positive rate while 
increasing  the  correlation  true  positive  rate  of  timing-perturbed 
connections. Nevertheless, Donoho et al.’s work [5] represents an 
important first step toward a better understanding of the inherent 
limitations of timing perturbation by the attacker on timing-based 
correlation.      Issues  that  were  not  addressed  included  whether 
correlation  is  effective  for  arbitrarily  distributed  (rather  than 
Pareto  distribution  conserving)  random  timing  perturbation,  and 
the achievable tradeoff of false and true positive rates. 
In the following sections we investigate these and other issues.

correlation  is  “active”  in  that  it  embeds  a  unique  watermark  into 
encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. 
The unique watermark that is embedded gives us an advantage over 
passive timing based correlation in resisting timing perturbation.  
We assume the following about the random timing perturbation:  
1)  While the attacker can add extra delay to any or all packets 
of  an  outgoing  flow  of  the  stepping  stone,  the  maximum 
delay he/she can introduce is bounded. 
2)  The  random 
timing  perturbation  on  each  packet 
is 
independent and identically distributed (iid) 
3)  All  packets  in  the  original  flow  are  kept  in  their  original 
order,  i.e.,  no  padding  packet  is  added  and  no  packet  is 
dropped by the attacker 
4)  While  the  watermarking  scheme  may  be  known  to  the 
attacker, the parameters of the watermarking are not known 
by the attacker.  
3.1  Watermarking Model and Concept 
Generally,  digital  watermarking[1]  involves  the  selection  of  a 
watermark  carrier  domain  and  the  design  of  two  complementary 
processes:  embedding  and  decoding.  The  watermark  embedding 
process embeds the watermark bits into the carrier signal by a slight 
modification  of  some  property  of  the  watermark  carrier,  and  the 
watermark decoder process detects and extracts any watermark bits 
(or equivalently determines the existence of a given watermark) from 
the carrier signal.  To correlate encrypted connections, in this paper 
we  propose  to  use  inter-packet  timing  as  the  watermark  carrier 
domain. 
For  a  unidirectional  flow  of  n>1  packets,  we  use  ti  and  t’i  to 
represent  the  arrival  and  departure  times,  respectively,  of  the  ith 
packet Pi of a flow incoming to and outgoing from some stepping 
stone.  (Given  a  bidirectional  connection,  we  can  split  it  into  two 
unidirectional flows and process each independently.) 
Assume  without  loss  of  generality  that  the  normal  processing 
and queuing delay added by the stepping stone is a constant c>0, 
and that the attacker introduces extra delay di to packet Pi at the 
stepping stone; then we have t’i =ti+c+di. 
We  define  the  arrival  inter-packet  delay  (AIPD)  between  Pi 
and Pj as

and the departure inter-packet delay (DIPD) between Pi and Pj as 
We  will  use  IPD  to  denote  either  AIPD  or  DIPD  when  it  is 
clear in the context.  We further define the impact or perturbation 
on ipdi,j by the attacker as the difference between ipd’i,j and ipdi,j: 
ipd’i,j - ipdi,j = dj-di. 
Assume D>0 is the maximum delay that the attacker can add to 
Pi (i=1,…,n), then the impact or perturbation on ipdi,j is dj-di∈[-D, 
D]. Accordingly range [-D, D] is called the perturbation range of 
the attacker. 
To make our method robust against timing attacks, we choose to

embed the watermark only over selected IPDs. The selection 
of  IPDs  requires  randomly  choosing  the  set  of  packets  and 
random  pairing  of  those  chosen  packets  to  get  IPDs.  The 
random  IPD  selection  is  unknown  to  the  attacker;  it  should 
be  difficult  for  the  attacker  to  detect  the  existence  of, 
extract,  or  corrupt 
the  embedded  watermark,  without 
knowing  the  IPD  selection  function  and  other  watermark 
embedding parameters.

Decoding 
As  an  IPD  is  conceptually  a  continuous  value,  we  will  first 
quantize the IPD before embedding the watermark bit. Given any

quantization step size s>0 as the function
