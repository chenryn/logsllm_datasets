See #10294:
It is useful to filter `@RequestMapping` method based on request headers,
similarly to filtering by paramters. In effect, this feature would look
something like:
`@RequestMapping`(value = "/hotels", header = "content-type=text/*")
This would match requests where the Content-Type header is 'text/plain',
'text/html', etc.
