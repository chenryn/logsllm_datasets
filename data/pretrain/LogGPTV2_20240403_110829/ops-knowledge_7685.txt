Question: "A penetration tester is assessing a web application for security vulnerabilities and discovers that certain user input is being directly reflected in the server's HTTP response without proper validation or encoding. While testing various vectors for reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, the tester decides to use different character encodings to bypass potential input filters. Which of the following actions is most likely to succeed in executing a reflected XSS attack if the web application is improperly handling character encoding?"
 "A": "Injecting a script tag with a straightforward payload such as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into the input."
 "B": "Encoding the script tag using hexadecimal encoding, such as `%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C%2Fscript%3E`, before injecting it."
 "C": "Avoiding script tags entirely and only using plain text to test the input validation process."
 "D": "Uploading a .js file containing the payload to the server and linking to it from the input."
Answer: B
