User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can I log in to a malfunctioning domain controller? I have a setup here with a single domain controller and 4 servers which were whithin it's domain. The servers were brought down and are being repurposed, but we would like to keep backups of the machines around.

I am going through one by one and taking the backups, which requires that I login to these machines. I've been able to login to all the servers, except the domain controller. The domain controller itself seems to have not started all it's active directory services, and when one tries to login, it complains that the system cannot log you on now because the domain XXXXX is not available.

How can I login to this box?

Assistant: Start it in Directory Services Restore Mode (by pressing F8 at boot time), and you'll be able to log on using the DSRM password you chose during Active Directory setup.

Of course you remember that password, don't you? ;-)

(Almost no one seems to remember it when it's actually needed, i.e. when it's the only way to log on to a dead DC...)
