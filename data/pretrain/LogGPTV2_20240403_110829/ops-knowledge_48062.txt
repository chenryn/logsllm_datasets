**Question:**
How can I log in to a malfunctioning domain controller? I have a setup with a single domain controller and four servers that were part of its domain. The servers have been shut down and are being repurposed, but we would like to keep backups of the machines.

I am going through each server one by one to take backups, which requires me to log in to these machines. I have been able to log in to all the servers except the domain controller. The domain controller itself seems to have not started all of its Active Directory services, and when I try to log in, it displays an error message stating that the system cannot log me on because the domain "XXXXX" is not available.

How can I log in to this domain controller?

**Response:**

To log in to the malfunctioning domain controller, you should start it in Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM). To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Boot the Domain Controller:**
   - Restart the domain controller.
   - Press `F8` during the boot process to access the Advanced Boot Options menu.

2. **Select Directory Services Restore Mode:**
   - From the Advanced Boot Options menu, select "Directory Services Restore Mode" and press `Enter`.

3. **Log In Using the DSRM Password:**
   - Once the system boots into DSRM, you will be prompted to log in.
   - Use the DSRM password that was set during the Active Directory setup.

**Important Note:**
Ensure that you remember the DSRM password, as it is the only way to log in to the domain controller when it is in this mode. Many administrators often forget this password, so it is crucial to have it documented or stored securely.

By following these steps, you should be able to log in to the domain controller and proceed with your backup tasks.
