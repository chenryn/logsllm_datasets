User: When debugging my django apps I use pdb for interactive debugging with pdb.set_trace().
However, when I amend a file the local django webserver restarts and then I cant see what I type in the terminal, until I type reset.
Is there anyway for this to happen automatically? It can be real annoying, having to cancel the runserver and reset and restart it all the time.  I'm told it doesn't happen on other OS's (ubuntu) so is there anyway to make it not happen on the Mac?  (I'm using Snow Leopard).
Assistant: OK - this works for me I created a ~/.pdbrc and added

import os
   os.system("stty sane")

Now each time pdb is run it sets the line settings back to sane.
If I fall out to the terminal then I still have to do it manually - but it solves having to quit runserver and reset all the time.
