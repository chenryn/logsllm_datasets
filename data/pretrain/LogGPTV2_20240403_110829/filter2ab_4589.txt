**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Turla

Turla, a well-known threat actor, has employed PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. In some instances, these executions have been facilitated through custom executables or code derived from Empire's PSInject module.[232][184][233] Additionally, Turla has utilized PowerShell scripts to load and execute malware directly in memory, thereby evading detection by traditional antivirus solutions.
