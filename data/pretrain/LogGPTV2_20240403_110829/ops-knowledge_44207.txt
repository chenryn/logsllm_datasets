User: I am getting this dump occasionally from OpenERP, but it seems harmless. The code serves HTTP; is this dump what happens when a connection is dropped?

Exception happened during processing of request from ('10.100.2.71', 42799)
Traceback (most recent call last):

Assistant: This just means that the underlying TCP connection was abruptly dropped. In this case it means that you are trying to write data to a socket that has already been closed on the other side (by the client). It is harmless, it means that while your server was sending an HTTP response to the client (browser) she stopped the request (closed the browser for example).
