User: I am trying to use logrotate to rotate logs for a multi-process python service. Which of the following combination is commonly used (right and safe)?

WatchedFileHandler + logrotate with create option
OR
FileHandler + logrotate with copytruncate option

Option-1 seem to be used in openstack nova and glance projects. I have not seen option-2 being used. Will option-2 work as expected?. Are there any drawbacks with these approaches when used for multi-process apps?
Assistant: As WatchedFileHandler was provided specifically for use with external rotation tools like logrotate, I would suggest that it be used (Option 1). Why do you think you need Option 2?
In a multi-process environment where each process writes to its own logs, there shouldn't be any problems. However, processes shouldn't ever share log files.
