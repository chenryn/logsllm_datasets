Hello,  
I'm digging through Symfony's Security components trying to implement a custom
security bundle, and I really miss one thing: The Big Picture. There is a lot
written about individual components and even source code is quite
understandable, but there is nothing about how these components work together.
The workflow diagrams in HttpKernel documentation are extremely helpful. There
should be similar diagrams included in Security component documentation. How
all these components interact with each other? What happens during ordinary
HTTP request? What happens during login? What happens during subsequent HTTP
requests? …? …?
The documentation says there are some components (Guards missing, btw) and
that's it. No relation between them is provided. No context. Nothing about
basic principles nor ideas.
Security is important and must be well understood to make it right. A cookbook
without context is not enough — it helps when one understands, but does not
make him understand. Symfony Security component is powerful and complex, so it
is hard to get into it.
Someone who has deep understanding of the Security component, please, draw few
diagrams how it works. It will help many other developers.
