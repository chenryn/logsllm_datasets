User: Im trying to install cx_oracle with python2.7.11. all the tutorials i found for installing cx_oracle needs root access, however on the vm i dont have root access on the /usr or /etc folders. Is there any way to install cx_oracle in my user directory?
Assistant: You a Python virtual environment - this way you do not ever need to use System Privs for adding new functionality to your Python Dev Environment.
Look for the command pyvenv - there is lots of info on this.
