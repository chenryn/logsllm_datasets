Service layer: Query the resource information in the database according to the ID. 4. Modify a single resource: Controller: Get the resource information and ID from the request parameters, call the method of the service layer, and modify the resource with the specified ID in the database. Service layer: modify the corresponding resource information in the database according to the ID. 5. Delete a single resource: Controller: Obtain the resource ID according to the request parameters, call the method of the service layer, delete the resource with the specified ID in the database, and return the operation result.
