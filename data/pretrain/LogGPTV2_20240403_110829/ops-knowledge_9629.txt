I have two video streams:
1. A VLC-generated, compressed MP4 UDP stream.
2. An uncompressed DV UDP stream.

Both streams are destined for a Unix host. On this receiving host, I would like to detect the type of incoming stream using either Bash or Python scripting. Note that I do not have root privileges, so I cannot use `tcpdump`.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to implement this?

Thank you.

### Response:

You might want to consider using the `pyffmpeg` library. This library can help you extract container information from the video streams, which should allow you to determine the type of stream. 

Here’s a basic example of how you could use `pyffmpeg` in Python to achieve this:

```python
import ffmpeg

def detect_stream_type(stream_path):
    try:
        # Get metadata from the stream
        probe = ffmpeg.probe(stream_path)
        
        # Extract format information
        format_info = probe['format']
        format_name = format_info['format_name']
        
        # Determine the type of stream based on the format name
        if 'mp4' in format_name:
            return "Compressed MP4 UDP stream"
        elif 'dv' in format_name:
            return "Uncompressed DV UDP stream"
        else:
            return "Unknown stream type"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return "Unable to determine stream type"

# Example usage
stream_path = "udp://@<host>:<port>"
stream_type = detect_stream_type(stream_path)
print(f"Detected stream type: {stream_type}")
```

This script uses `pyffmpeg` to probe the stream and extract its format information. Based on the format name, it determines whether the stream is a compressed MP4 UDP stream or an uncompressed DV UDP stream.

Make sure to install the `pyffmpeg` library if you haven't already:

```sh
pip install pyffmpeg
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
