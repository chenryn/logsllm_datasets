User: I have 2 video streams
(1) VLC Generated Compressed MP4 UDP stream
(2) DV Uncompressed UDP Stream
Both are destined to a host. At this Unix receiving host, I would like to detect type of stream coming using Bash or Python Scripting (without tcpdump, I do not have root priv.)
ANY idea guys how to implement ? 
Thank you.
Assistant: what about trying pyffmpeg out. you should be able to get the container info from that.
