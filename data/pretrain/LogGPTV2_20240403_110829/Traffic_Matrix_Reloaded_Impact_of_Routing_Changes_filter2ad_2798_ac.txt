Out of the trafﬁc matrix elements that do experience large trafﬁc variations 15% have
an average of more than one large trafﬁc variation per week. The small percentage of
elements that experience large trafﬁc variations combined with the low frequency large
shifts per element may lead to the incorrect conclusion that these events are irrelevant.
However, if we consider the network-wide frequency of large trafﬁc shifts, these events
happen fairly often. To show this, we have counted the number of 10-minute measurement
intervals for which at least one of our eight vantage points experienced a large trafﬁc
variation. On average, the network experiences a large trafﬁc variation every four and
half hours. Large trafﬁc variations caused by routing changes happen every 2.3 days,
and very large routing-induced trafﬁc variations happen every 5.9 days. If our analysis
considered all of the PoPs in the network, the overall frequency of large trafﬁc variations
would be even higher.

Implication for Trafﬁc Matrix Studies
Our analysis on trafﬁc matrix variations has important implications for the results of
previous measurement studies.
Differences across vantage points: The results in Section 3 show that the likelihood
of changes in the preﬁx-to-egress mappings can vary signiﬁcantly from one ingress
router to another. In particular, some ingress points may be much more susceptible to
hot-potato routing changes than others [10], making analysis of routing stability very
dependent on where the data are collected. For example, the study in [11] showed that
popular destination preﬁxes do not experience BGP routing changes for days or weeks
at a time. In addition to studying RouteViews and RIPE BGP feeds, the analysis in-
cluded iBGP data from two of the eight routers used in our current study. In our analysis,
these two routers did not experience many hot-potato routing changes. Had the analy-
sis in [11] analyzed a router that experiences several hot-potato routing changes a day,
the conclusions might have been quite different. In fact, hot-potato routing changes can
affect a large number of preﬁxes [10], both popular and not, so we might reasonably
expect popular destinations to experience changes in their egress points. A prelimi-
nary analysis across all eight vantage points conﬁrms that popular destination preﬁxes
262
R. Teixeira et al.
have more BGP instabilities from vantage points that experience more hot-potato routing
changes.
Choice of metrics in studying unlikely events: The analysis in Section 3 shows that
large changes in the trafﬁc matrix elements occur relatively infrequently. In addition,
most changes in the preﬁx-to-egress mapping do not lead to large trafﬁc shifts, consistent
with the results in [7]. Yet, these two results do not imply that routing changes are not a
signiﬁcant contributor to large changes in the trafﬁc matrix elements. In fact, the opposite
is true. A small number of routing changes are indeed responsible for a relatively large
fraction of the (few) large trafﬁc shifts. In addition, long traces are necessary to draw
conclusions about infrequent (yet signiﬁcant) events. The study in [7] draws on ﬁve
traces of 6–22 hours in duration, outside of the maintenance periods where operators
made planned changes to the internal network, making it difﬁcult to conclude deﬁnitively
if large trafﬁc shifts occur and whether routing contributes to them.
Errors from ignoring egress changes in trafﬁc matrix analysis: Previous work on
measuring and analyzing trafﬁc matrices has assumed that routing is stable, in part
because ﬁne-grained routing data is sometimes difﬁcult to collect. Most of the work on
trafﬁc matrix estimation [1, 2, 4] assumes that there are no changes in the preﬁx-to-egress
mapping or the intradomain paths between the ingress and egress points. Even work on
direct measurement of the trafﬁc demands [5, 13] has used only daily routing snapshots,
although the work in [7] is a notable exception. Using out-of-date routing information
runs the risk of associating some trafﬁc measurements with the wrong elements in the
trafﬁc matrix. In some cases, the routing changes might lead to second-order effects
on the trafﬁc (e.g., by causing congestion or increasing the round-trip time) that may
appear in the data, but the primary affect of the trafﬁc moving to a different egress point
is obscured—as is the reason for the variation in the trafﬁc. In addition, changes in the
preﬁx-to-egress mapping may cause large ﬂuctuations in multiple trafﬁc matrix elements
at the same time, which would be obscured if the trafﬁc matrix is computed or analyzed
without regard for routing changes. In our ongoing work, we plan to quantify the errors
in the trafﬁc matrix computed using daily snapshots, similar to the approach in [7] but
focusing speciﬁcally on routing changes that have a large affect on multiple trafﬁc matrix
elements.
Dependence on network design, trafﬁc, and goals: The results of any trafﬁc matrix
analysis, including ours, depend on the details of the network under study. For example,
large ISP networks handle high volumes of aggregated trafﬁc, which may experience
much smaller statistical ﬂuctuations in the trafﬁc. In addition, a large ISP network con-
nects to its peers and many of its customers in multiple locations in the network, increas-
ing the likelihood that destination preﬁxes are reachable via multiple egress points. This
makes an ISP network much more likely to experience changes in the preﬁx-to-egress
mapping over time. Together, these two factors tend to make routing changes have a
larger relative inﬂuence on the trafﬁc matrix in ISP networks than in other kinds of
networks. Even within a single network, the ﬂuctuations in the trafﬁc matrix may vary
from one ingress point to another, due to hot-potato routing changes or the particular
senders and receivers connected to that router. Identifying metrics that isolate each of
these effects would be very helpful in deepening our fundamental understanding of what
causes ﬂuctuations in trafﬁc matrices.

5 Conclusion
Our study shows that large trafﬁc variations, while unusual, do sometimes happen.
Although most routing changes typically do not affect much trafﬁc, routing is usually a
major contributor to large trafﬁc variations. This implies that network operators need to
design the network to tolerate trafﬁc variations that are much larger than typical statistical
ﬂuctuations in the incoming trafﬁc. In addition, research on trafﬁc engineering and
anomaly detection should take into account the impact of routing on the trafﬁc matrix.
Since both the trafﬁc demands V and the preﬁx-to-egress mapping ε are necessary to
compute an accurate trafﬁc matrix, we believe it is more accurate to operate on V and ε
directly, rather than simply on T M.
This work has implications for both the research and network operations communi-
ties. Researchers should consider the impact of changes in the preﬁx-to-egress mapping
when analyzing the trafﬁc matrix. Ignoring these changes might lead to wrong conclu-
sions about trafﬁc matrix stability. Operators need to provision for trafﬁc variations that
are much larger than normal trafﬁc ﬂuctuations. In addition, operators often need to
diagnose the cause of a large surge in trafﬁc. Our work shows that the routing system is
one important place they should look for explanations.
As future work we plan to quantify the inaccuracies introduced in studies of routing
and trafﬁc stability when changes in ε are ignored. We are also studying the duration
of the trafﬁc shifts. If trafﬁc shifts are short-lived, then network operators should just
over-provision to tolerate them. If they are long-lived, however, adapting the routing
protocol conﬁguration may be a better approach for alleviating congestion.
