User: I have created installer for Linux tool, this tool depends on libguestfs. 
The question is, what are the minimum required libguestfs packages I need to install in order for my tool to work?
Assistant: It depends on the distro you are using and the version of libguestfs, but let's assume Fedora/RHEL/Debian and you're using libguestfs â‰¥ 1.18.
In that case for local mount functionality you will only need the basic library package, called libguestfs on Fedora-like or libguestfs0 on Debian-like distros.  You may also want the fusermount tool which is part of FUSE.
If you're using guestfish, then you'll need the tools package.  On Fedora you can just depend on /usr/bin/guestfish which does the Right Thing.  On Debian it's in a package called guestfish.
If you're using libguestfs through bindings (eg. from Python) then you should also depend upon the bindings package, eg. python-libguestfs (Fedora) or python-guestfs (Debian).
