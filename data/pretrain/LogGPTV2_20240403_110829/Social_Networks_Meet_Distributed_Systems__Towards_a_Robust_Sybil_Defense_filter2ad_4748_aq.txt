Gatekeeper [27]. Motivated by the result of the previous
experiment, we examine the eﬀectiveness of applying Gate-
keeper [27], a state-of-the-art decentralized SNSD scheme,
given our default experimental setting of strategic attack
and high unavailability (c = 0.8).
We adapt Gatekeeper [27] (Sec. 2.1) to take into account
churn as an integral factor. Each veriﬁer v performs the
following. First, v obtains s = 100 seeds using the random
walk method that Gatekeeper borrows from SybilLimit [31].
Second, each seed x sends t = O(log((1− c)∗ n)) tickets in a
breadth-ﬁrst fashion so that at least (1− c)∗ n/2 nodes each
receive a ticket. Third, the veriﬁer accepts a suspect node
p if p received tickets from at least fadmit ∗ s seeds. We set
fadmit = 0.2 which was used in the Gatekeeper study [27].
Figure 14 plots the distribution of the number of hon-
est and Sybil suspect nodes accepted relative to the total
number of online honest nodes at a given instance, for 25
veriﬁers each in 50 runs. The MinEC heuristic outperforms
others, with a high probability, in terms of accepting over
80% of all the online honest nodes, while accepting a very
low number of Sybil nodes. Also, note that the MinEC heuris-
tic has lesser variance than the others, indicating consistent
performance for various veriﬁers including the ones close to
the Sybil region.
7. CONCLUSIONS
We presented an extensive study examining two key challenges–
Sybil attacks and heavy churn–in the ﬁeld of social network-
based distributed systems. In the face of such challenges, we
showed that SNSD schemes deal with a fundamental trade-
oﬀ between network connectivity and attack resilience. We

proposed a new design point in this trade-oﬀ with MinEC,
which fares as good as Two-Hop in terms of network con-
nectivity (disconnection probability) and One-Hop in terms
of attack resilience (escape probability). Our experiments
revealed MinEC’s robustness to various parameters’ testing
conditions as well as the feasibility in its application to the
existing state-of-the-art and potential future SNSD schemes
relying on the fast-mixing property with minimal changes.
We believe our work can be extended in the following di-
rections. First, providing a guarantee of high network con-
nectivity (1% disconnection probability) under heavy churn
(c ≥ 0.95) may require exploring beyond the 2-hop neigh-
borhood of each node for better connectivity while avoiding
malicious nodes. Second, the theoretical analysis on select-
ing k remains an open problem. Third, the designs of social
routing systems could be revisited considering heavy churn.
