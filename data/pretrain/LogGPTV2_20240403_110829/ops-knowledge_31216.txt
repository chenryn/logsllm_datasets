**Issue:**
I have installed Python 2.7 (64-bit) on my Windows 7 (64-bit) PC without any issues. However, I am unable to run `.py` scripts via the DOS shell unless I specify the full path to the Python executable.

**Details:**

- **Command that does not work:**
  ```sh
  D:\> myscript.py
  ```
  - The script opens in WordPad instead of running.

- **Command that works:**
  ```sh
  D:\> C:\Python27\python.exe myscript.py
  ```
  - The script runs correctly.

**Attempts to Resolve:**

1. **Changing Default Application:**
   - I tried changing the default application for `.py` files using the Windows 7 GUI (Control Panel, etc.), but Python is not listed as an available software option.
   - Even when manually setting `python.exe` as the default program, the association did not work.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - I checked the environment variables and confirmed that the Python path is included in the `Path` variable:
     ```sh
     Path = C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts
     ```

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - I modified the registry key `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\python.exe\shell\open\command` from:
     ```sh
     "C:\Python27\python.exe" "%1"
     ```
     to:
     ```sh
     "C:\Python27\python.exe" "%1" %*
     ```
   - This change did not resolve the issue.

**Suggestion Request:**
Any suggestions on how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated.

**Solution:**

@slv's answer was helpful, but since I had previous Python installations, I needed to take additional steps. One of the main issues was that the directory of my Python installation had changed. Here are the steps I followed:

1. **Registry Cleanup:**
   - Open `regedit.exe`.
   - Search the entire registry for `.py`, `.pyw`, `.pyx`, and `.pyc` and delete all occurrences.
   - Search the entire registry for the old Python installation path (e.g., `C:\Users\Desktop\Anaconda3`) and replace it with the new installation path (e.g., `C:\Users\Desktop\Miniconda3`).
   - Specifically, update the key `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\python.exe\shell\open\command` to reflect the new path.

2. **Reassociate .py Files:**
   - After making these changes, I was able to reassociate `.py` files with `python.exe` using the "Open with..." menu.

This resolved the issue, and I can now run `.py` scripts from the DOS shell without specifying the full path to the Python executable.
