**Later (because it has to wait for the announcement following the withdrawal to penalize the route). At most, one extra withdrawal message is propagated under the new scheme.**

**Finally, selective flap damping also eliminates announcement-triggered suppression, which consists of successive announcements with increasing degrees of preference. Since our scheme does not count successive monotonic route changes as flaps, both forms of suppression are eliminated.**

**We have validated through simulation that selective flap damping actually eliminates withdrawal-triggered suppression. As shown in Figure 7, selective flap damping exhibits convergence times comparable to the situation when damping is disabled, both for the clique and pyramid topologies. Additionally, we verified this for our realistic topology, where selective flap damping shows the same convergence time and number of messages as the case when flap damping is disabled.**

**Furthermore, we verified that selective damping can suppress actual flaps. To do this, we simulated network failures by making node 1 in each of our topologies repeatedly flap (i.e., alternately withdraw and announce the route to d) with a period of 40 seconds. We then observed the number of additional messages it takes for selective damping to suppress the route compared to the unmodified route flap damping implementation. Our simulation shows that it takes at most 8 additional messages for selective damping to suppress a continuously flapping route, compared to the original RFD scheme. A scheme that does not use any form of damping will instead send an update every 40 seconds. For each topology size, the actual number of additional messages differs. For instance, for a clique of size 5, it takes on average 3 extra messages. For a clique of size 20, it takes on average 6 extra messages.**

**8. RELATED WORK**

**This paper investigates the interaction between route flap damping and BGP convergence. Route flap damping has received very little examination in the research literature. In the standards world, two documents are most often referenced in connection with route flap damping. The route flap damping standard [3] describes the rationale for route flap damping and outlines a possible implementation strategy for the mechanism. While that document discusses some interactions between flap damping and topology, it does not discuss announcement or withdrawal-triggered suppression. An associated document, the RIPE recommendations [9], tantalizingly hints that one or both of these phenomena may have been observed in practice. To quote:**

**"The only explanation would be that the multiple interconnections between Ebone/AS1755 and ICM/AS1800 did multiply the flaps (advertisements/withdrawals arrived time-shifted at ICM routers through the multiple circuits). This would then potentially hold true for any meshed topology because of the propagation delays of advertisements/withdrawals."**

**However, it then proposes a solution that we do not believe addresses the problem, nor does it analyze the phenomenon in any level of detail.**

**Also related to route flap damping is a technique for damping link state changes. Rodeheffer et al. [18] proposed a filter, called a skeptic, that penalizes unstable link state information for a time that increases logarithmically with the number of flaps of the link state. The details of the algorithm are different from route flap damping, and it would be interesting to compare how the two perform on various kinds of flaps.**

**In the academic community, there have been two threads of prior research into the following properties of BGP: stability and convergence delays.**

**Stability: The first thread started with the observation that certain policy configurations could cause persistent route oscillations in BGP [19]. Later, Griffin and Wilfong [6] showed the intractability of determining a safe policy configuration for BGP. Finally, Rexford and Gao [20] proved that if BGP's policy expressiveness is confined to a simple set of policies, persistent route oscillations cannot occur. Independently, Labovitz et al. [21] showed that instability could occur even without policy conflicts due to implementation artifacts. Thus, this first thread confirmed the value of the route flap damping standard and probably influenced the RIPE recommendations.**

**Convergence Delays: The second thread of BGP research is a careful analysis of the dynamics of BGP's route convergence properties [7, 8] and resulted in the interesting finding that BGP's route withdrawal process could result in a combinatorially large number of path explorations.**

**Thus, our paper can be considered a convergence between these two threads of research because it shows that the RFD mechanism used to improve stability can exacerbate convergence delays. Other more recent prior work has explored and attempted to solve delayed Internet routing convergence. Griffin et al. [12] explored how convergence is affected by the MRAI timer setting and addressed its impact on various topologies. In their future work, they pointed out the potential for route flap damping to be invoked by oscillations inherent in the BGP protocol. In this work, we confirm their suspicion by thoroughly studying its interaction with convergence.**

**More directly related is the work of Pei et al. [14], who attempted to avoid path exploration during route withdrawal by using consistency assertions. They showed that their approach can invalidate all paths within one MRAI round in some cases. This is an intriguing approach that might work, although it needs extensive experimentation to be widely deployed and does not work in all cases (e.g., when policy is used for traffic engineering). It should be clear from this paper that a fix for withdrawal path exploration in BGP will reduce the occurrence of the phenomenon we see in this paper. Despite this, the value of our paper is that it provides the first analysis of the interaction between RFD and convergence and suggests an alternate solution for this interaction that is useful, if a general solution to eliminate withdrawal path exploration turns out to be hard to design and deploy.**

**9. CONCLUSION**

**In this paper, we analyze a previously not well-studied interaction between BGP's route withdrawal process and its route flap damping mechanism for ensuring the overall stability of the Internet routing system. This interaction can, depending on the topology, suppress the propagation of a route that has been withdrawn once and re-announced for up to one hour. We have shown that this interaction has a number of subtle features. For instance, we found that in the pyramid topology, increasing the size of the topology actually improved the rate of convergence.**

**We have proposed a simple fix to this withdrawal-triggered suppression called selective flap damping. It relies on being able to weed out secondary flaps using a monotonicity condition, which selectively avoids penalizing such secondary flaps. Our selective flap damping mechanism successfully eliminates withdrawal-triggered suppression in all the topologies that we have analyzed.**

**We leave for further work the problem of accurately characterizing the network topologies and sizes that will induce withdrawal-triggered suppression. A theoretical analysis of the properties of selective flap damping would also be desirable. Despite this, our paper, together with [7, 8], makes it clear that faster convergence does require modifying BGP. This could be done by either fixing the withdrawal path exploration phenomenon (the direction followed in [14]) or by deploying a mechanism similar in spirit to selective flap damping (as in our paper). Either way, such BGP modifications could move us closer to the Holy Grail: an inter-domain routing protocol that is stable and yet reroutes traffic extremely fast after failure.**
