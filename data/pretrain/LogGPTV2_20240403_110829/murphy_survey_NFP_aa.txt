ABSTRACT Network Fault Prediction, a field three decade old, has seen a surge in scientific interest in therecent years. The ability to predict network equipment failure is increasingly identified as an effective tool to
increase network reliability. This predictive capability can then be used, to either mitigate incoming network
failures, or to enact preventive maintenance on incoming failures, and could enable the emergence of zero-
failure networks and allow safety-critical applications to run over larger, higher complexity heterogeneousnetworks. After defining the key terms and describing the core concepts of Network Fault Prediction, this
article shares performance parameters of a specific network and systems integrator’s current operations in
network maintenance, and provides a description of the Machine Learning methods used for Network Fault
Prediction, followed by a survey of recent research applications in the field. Finally, this article lays outperspectives for future research.
