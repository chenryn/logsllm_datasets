face. Of the eight participants who were unable to register,
four did not meet the study requirements (three had no lock-
ing mechanism conﬁgured, while the other ran Android 6),
one failed to authenticate within 60 seconds, and three en-
countered an unspeciﬁed error indicating an issue with their
phone or settings. The entire registration process, including
account creation and the survey, took a median of 18 minutes.
The entire authentication process, including the survey, took
a median of 9.5 minutes.
Of these 42 participants, 39 returned for the authentication
phase, and 33 of them were able to authenticate successfully.
Of the 42 participants who were successfully registered, 23
were men and 19 were women. Our participants tended to
be young, with 8 who were 18-24, 21 who were 25-34, 9
who were 35-44, and 4 who were 45+. Participants’ highest
level of education attainment was as follows: 9 had a post-
graduate degree, 20 had a college degree, 5 had completed
some college without a degree, 7 had a high school diploma,
and 1 had not completed high school. Finally, 26 had no
background in technology/IT, 14 did, and 2 did not answer.
3.3 Key Security Misconceptions
The most severe misconception we identiﬁed was the belief
that biometric data is stored in the online service’s database.
Storage Location: The key misconception held by partici-
pants was where biometrics were stored when using biometric
WebAuthn. Only 14 participants (33%) correctly identiﬁed
that biometrics were stored on their phone. The majority,
20 participants (48%), believed biometrics were stored on
the server or in a remote database operated by the website
(“Within the ExampleTech servers which would hopefully be
secure,” P07). Eight participants expressed uncertainty in
where their biometrics might be stored. When we asked if an
employee of ExampleTech would have access to their biomet-
ric data, the majority (83%) disagreed, yet only 12 participants
(28%) justiﬁed their answer based on their biometric data be-
ing stored locally. Among those who thought the biometric
data was stored somewhere other than their phone, reasoning
ranged from believing it was stored in an encrypted format to
believing sites had a moral obligation to protect private data
(it would be a “breach of trust”). Two participants argued that
an employee would not have physical access to their phone,
so they would not be able to access the biometric information.
Processing of Biometric Data: Only 24 out of the 42 par-
ticipants correctly thought their biometric would be safe from
an attacker who stole data from the website’s database. Seven
thought the attacker would have their biometric, indicating
that they likely believed it would be stored in the website’s
database. Another 11 were unsure whether an attacker would
have access to biometrics stored on their phone, indicating
uncertainty about how the biometric data is processed and
whether the resulting data would allow an attacker to recon-
struct a participant’s face or ﬁngerprint.
Third-Party Access: Prior research [63] found that some
users are concerned about their biometric data being transmit-
ted to third parties. Our participants did not hold this concern.
However, many did not realize their data never leaves their
device. 14 participants thought their biometric or data de-
rived from it are sent to the ExampleTech server. Only four
were positive that their biometric data is not sent outside their
phone. Eight participants vaguely described their understand-
ing as a local veriﬁcation of their biometric on their device.
Lost Phones: We asked participants if someone who found
their phone could access their account. 39 participants said no,
stating that this person would not have access to their physical
biometric (“No one can steal your ﬁngerprint from you,” P36).
Only three participants said the person probably could access
their account. No participant mentioned the possibility of
logging in using the PIN, pattern, or password instead.
3.4 Key Usability Misconceptions
The most problematic usability misconception was that par-
ticipants believed they could sign into their ExampleTech
account using a different device.
Availability: A key misconception that participants had
was how the fallback mechanism used to unlock the phone
(e.g., PIN, pattern, or password) could be used to log in if the
biometric failed. Only 12 participants believed they would
still be able to sign into their account if their biometric failed,
while 25 incorrectly believed they would be unable to do so.
Five participants were aware that they could use their phone’s
PIN or password in place of their biometric. Participants
commonly stated that, if their biometric failed, they would

not be able to sign in because they had not yet set up a fallback
method (“I won’t because, that’s the only sign in method that
I used during registration,” P45). Five participants stated
they would need to create a separate password or contact
ExampleTech’s support hotline. Other participants did not
even identify the possibility of a backup system, believing the
biometric was the only option to authenticate.
Multiple Devices: Misconceptions around device sharing
were common, with 11 participants indicating that they would
be able to log into their account on a device other than the
one where they registered (“My ﬁngerprint wouldn’t have
changed so I should be able to log in,” P29). This ﬁnd-
ing again indicates a misunderstanding about the underlying
functionality of WebAuthn. The current WebAuthn speciﬁ-
cation [5] does not permit transferring the private key across
authenticators [54], requiring a roaming authenticator or an
alternative scheme to register a new device. The biometric or
its fallback scheme (PIN, pattern, or password) are only used
to decrypt and unlock the private key on the device. Even if
participants were aware that their biometric data is not stored
with the website and that they cannot log in from another
device, the explanations given for not being able to sign in
were incorrect. 18 participants thought they could not sign in
because their biometric data is not registered in their friend’s
phone. Only six participants correctly explained that the login
and ﬁngerprint is tied to the device that they used for regis-
tration (“. . . because it’s linked to the device I created it on,”
P24). Broadly, this misconception is reasonable as signing in
from multiple devices is possible with traditional passwords.
Delegating Access: When asked if a trusted person could
be given access to the account without the participant present,
39 participants thought there was no way since the friend
would not have their biometric (“They wouldn’t be able to
except if they cut my hand or there’s another form like a
password,” P14). Only one participant mentioned a potential
fallback option, and only three pointed at the possibility of
registering a friend’s biometric on their phone to grant access.
3.5 Versus Other Authentication Methods
We investigated whether the misconceptions we observed
were speciﬁcally related to WebAuthn or also applied to bio-
metric authentication in other contexts. In contrast to biomet-
ric WebAuthn, participants thought that their biometric data is
only stored locally when it comes to phone unlocking. When
it comes to passwords, participants had a better understanding
of the processing and storage.
Comparison to Non-biometric Methods: Participants
showed a clearer understanding of where their biometrics
are stored when they unlock their phone. 30 out of the 42
participants said they believed their biometrics are only stored
on their personal device. The remainder either thought they
were stored on the cloud or with their phone manufacturer.
However, only 8 participants reasoned that biometrics are only
stored locally; 4 more argued that an employee of the phone
manufacturer would not have physical access to their device.
7 participants stated that an attacker having access depends
on how biometrics are stored, such as in an encrypted format.
12 participants had similar reasoning when considering an
employee at the phone manufacturer not having access. This
indicates that participants still lack a full understanding of
how biometric data is used to unlock their phone, which is a
more familiar process than biometric WebAuthn.
Comparison to Passwords: We also asked participants
if they thought an employee of a website on which they use
a traditional password would have access to their plaintext
password. The majority, 26 participants, correctly understood
that an employee would not have access because the password
is “encrypted” or more generally that access to it is restricted
by law. Nevertheless, we also identiﬁed misconceptions sur-
rounding password security. Six participants argued that the
password is stored with the website so the employees must
have access, while three more said that only employees like IT
administrators would have access. When considering hackers,
most participants showed a correct understanding of the rele-
vance of the storage format. Some argued that “encryption”
(hashing) will prevent an attacker from actually having their
password. Others noted it is relatively easy to circumvent
the security precautions taken with passwords. Four partici-
pants mentioned personal experience with password breaches
(“happened in the past and has been in the news,” P14).
We also asked participants whether they considered pass-
words or biometric login to be more secure. In line with
previous research [7], most participants argued that the bio-
metric login is more secure. They mentioned well-known
attacks on passwords, like shoulder surﬁng, or they stated a
belief that a biometric cannot be copied or guessed (“Unlike
passwords, one’s ﬁngerprint can never be guessed,” P15).
Participants strongly preferred biometric WebAuthn over
passwords. Most argued from a convenience point of view,
with 20 mentioning the process was easy and seven stating it
was fast. Ten argued that using biometrics for authentication
is more secure. Nine pointed out that, unlike a password, the
biometric data cannot be forgotten and that there is no need
to remember it in the ﬁrst place. Two participants noted that
no one can impersonate them as biometric data is unique.
4 Study 2: Co-design Focus Groups
In our second study, we followed a co-design (participatory de-
sign) approach to create more effective ways to communicate
the security and usability advantages of biometric WebAuthn.
In particular, we hoped to counteract the misconceptions iden-
tiﬁed in Study 1. Participants were asked to come up with
single-screen notiﬁcations that addressed misconceptions and
communicate the advantages of biometric WebAuthn.

4.1 Method
As detailed in Section 2.3, co-design focus groups have been
used in past security research to help elicit user perceptions
that may not surface in individual interviews. Participants in
groups challenge the researchers’, and each others’, views and
preconceptions. This facilitates identifying a middle ground.
Inexperienced end-users can be more creative, open minded,
and less biased than the researchers, which enriches the noti-
ﬁcation design process. We conducted 7 online focus groups
with 2 to 7 participants per group. Focus groups lasted 75
minutes. Participants were compensated $25. Each group
had at most one participant with technical background knowl-
edge. Individuals were recruited via Proliﬁc and were asked
to participate in a small group meeting via a video conferenc-
ing platform. To protect their privacy during a session, we
encouraged participants to select a pseudonym. After asking
for consent, we audio recorded each session. All sessions
started with a series of warm-up questions where participants
described their feelings towards passwords and experiences
with biometrics. Similar to Lyastani et al. [32], we created a
video2 to present the mechanics of account creation and sign-
in because biometric WebAuthn would be unfamiliar to many
participants. The video intentionally did not try to explain
the underlying public-key-cryptography-based authentication
process. To allow participants to form their own opinions, we
did not mention any potential advantages or disadvantages of
biometric WebAuthn. Participants were asked to share their
initial impressions afterwards.
We then provided participants with 1 out of 4 resources
from trusted sources [19,24,27,64] that explained WebAuthn.
In selecting articles, we required they have imagery, mention
biometric login, and include an explanation of WebAuthn.
They should take no longer than 5 minutes to read and contain
no technical details (e.g., code snippets). We found appropri-
ate articles on the ﬁrst 5 pages returned when searching for
terms like “What is WebAuthn” and “Passwordless Authenti-
cation.” Moreover, we provided another document speciﬁcally
addressing the misconceptions identiﬁed in Study 1. This doc-
ument can be found in our online appendix [31].
After participants had read the articles, we asked them to
explain what they understood about the WebAuthn login pro-
cess, making sure to address any confusions or inaccuracies.
Participants also elaborated on the most surprising aspect of
the process, where they thought their biometrics was stored,
and whether they would use it. We asked participants to iden-
tify what was unclear, left out, or satisfactory in the resources.
At the end, participants were asked to each come up with a
phone-screen-sized notiﬁcation brieﬂy explaining biometric
WebAuthn to someone without prior knowledge. We also
asked participants to draw a sketch that would support their
explanation. Finally, everyone presented their explanations
2Video demonstrating signing into a website using WebAuthn:

and drawings, and the group as a whole decided on the most
crucial points that should be part of a “perfect” explanation.
Those central elements were shared with future focus groups.
4.2 Participants and Overall Perceptions
Overall, 29 people participated in 7 focus groups. We ex-
cluded the data from two participants because they did not
participate fully in activities or discussions due to technical
issues. Of the 27, 19 were women and 8 were men. 69%
of the participants were between 18 and 34 years old, 27%
were between 35 and 44, and 4% were 45+. 86% of partici-
pants had at least some college education, the majority with a
bachelor’s degree. 18 participants were iPhone users, while
the rest were equally distributed among Samsung, Sony, and
Huawei. We asked their opinion on different authentication
mechanisms. They were surprisingly positive when speak-
ing about passwords. Only a handful explicitly mentioned
disliking passwords. P1 was the most emphatic, saying, “I
hate passwords with a passion.” The most common complaint
