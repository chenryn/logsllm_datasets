# Dark Mail and DIME: An Overview

## Key Figures
- **Ladar Levison**: Founder of Lavabit, an encrypted email service.
- **Stephen Watt**: Involved in the development of secure communication protocols.

## What is Dark Mail?
Dark Mail, also known as the Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME), is a secure email protocol designed to enhance privacy and security. It aims to address the vulnerabilities in traditional email systems by providing end-to-end encryption and minimizing metadata exposure.

### Key Components
- **DIME (Dark Internet Mail Environment)**: A protocol for secure email communication.
- **DMAP (DIME Management Protocol)**: Manages signets and other cryptographic keys.
- **DMTP (DIME Transport Protocol)**: Handles the transport of DIME messages.

## Why Do We Need It?
- **Guilt by Association**: Protects users from being implicated due to their associations.
- **Mass Surveillance**: Mitigates the risks of large-scale data collection.
- **Service Provider Vulnerabilities**: Reduces the impact of legal orders, search warrants, and other forms of surveillance.

## Goals
- **Message Confidentiality**: Ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message.
- **Author Validation**: Verifies the identity of the sender.
- **Minimize Metadata Exposure**: Reduces the amount of information available about the communication.
- **Automated Key Management**: Simplifies the management of cryptographic keys.
- **Efficient Access from Multiple Clients**: Allows seamless access across different devices.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Facilitates easy adoption and integration.

## Adoption and Security
- **Adoption**: The more people who use DIME, the more valuable and secure the system becomes.
- **Security Concerns**:
  - **DNS**: Potential for DNS spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - **Password Strength**: Weak passwords can compromise security.
  - **Endpoint Security**: Vulnerable endpoints can be exploited.
  - **Cryptographic Algorithms**: Outdated or weak algorithms can be broken.
  - **Implementation Vulnerabilities**: Bugs and flaws in the software.
  - **JavaScript Clients**: Webmail clients may have additional vulnerabilities.
  - **Hardware Backdoors**: If widely adopted, there is a risk that hardware may ship with backdoors.

## Signet: The Core of DIME
A **Signet** is a structured data format used in DIME to manage cryptographic keys and other attributes. 

### Signet Structure
- **Header**:
  - **Byte 1**: Signet Format Version Number
  - **Bytes 2-4**: Length of the Signet (minus the 4-byte header)

- **Defined Attributes**:
  - **Byte 1**: Attribute Type (e.g., Signing key, Encryption Key, Org Signature)
  - **Bytes 2-3**: Value Length
  - **Bytes 4-X**: Value

- **Undefined Attributes**:
  - **Byte 1**: Indicates Undefined Attribute Type (Value == 255)
  - **Byte 2**: Name Length
  - **Bytes 3-N**: Name
  - **Bytes (N+1)-(N+3)**: Value Length
  - **Bytes (N+4)-(N+4+X)**: Value

- **Maximum Size**: 16 megabytes due to the 3-byte length field.

### Trust Model
- **Primary Source**: The signet resolver obtains a signet from an authoritative primary source.
- **Secondary Source**: The signet is then validated using a pre-authenticated secondary source.
- **Trust No One**: A fundamental principle in the design of DIME.

  Mr. President, Iâ€™m afraid the ubiquitous adoption of dmail has made mass surveillance technologically impossible.
