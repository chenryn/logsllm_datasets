### Influence of Delegate-Selection Algorithms on fL: Distribution of pmal = LINKBASED, ξ = 0.5 (a,b) and ξ = 1 (c,d)

**Figure 3** illustrates the impact of different delegate-selection algorithms on the distribution of initially malicious users in our delegated key recovery scenario. The figure shows the performance of three algorithms: TRUSTBASED, RANDOMWALK, and FRIENDBASED.

- **(a) and (b)**: These sub-figures represent the scenario where the probability of a node being malicious (pmal) ranges from 1% to 50%, with ξ = 0.5.
- **(c) and (d)**: These sub-figures represent the scenario where pmal ranges from 0.1% to 1%, with ξ = 1.

The y-axis represents the fraction of nodes that are compromised, and the x-axis represents the percentage of initially malicious users. The results show that the TRUSTBASED algorithm consistently outperforms the other two algorithms across all scenarios, especially as the percentage of initially malicious users increases.

### Novelty and Contributions

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply threshold cryptography for private key backup and recovery in distributed social networks. Another key contribution is the introduction of trust measures based on social relationships among users. This solution is effective against infection spreading and resilient to various distributions of malicious nodes.

### Related Work

The most closely related works are [7] and [17], which also use threshold cryptographic approaches but for different problems in social networks. Specifically:

- **[17]**: Proposes using threshold cryptographic protocols for document signing, which requires the user to be available to issue the digital signature. Our work differs in that it focuses on key backup and recovery without requiring user availability.
- **[7]**: Proposes creating certificates based on the agreement of a number of nodes in the network. While both works address security in social networks, our work includes a detailed analysis of infection spreading and the selection of reliable delegates, which is not covered in [7].

In a broader context, our work is related to credential-based access control in P2P and social networks. Credentials can be generated by specialized hardware or based on user attributes. However, these approaches often assume that access is granted to authorized users with known identities, which is not applicable in our scenario of secret backup and recovery.

### Conclusion and Future Work

The secure backup and recovery of secrets in distributed online social systems is a critical and challenging issue. Our work provides a promising initial step toward a technical solution. We have studied the application of threshold-based secret sharing protocols and proposed an algorithm to select the most reliable delegates. This approach minimizes the probability of delegate collusion by leveraging social relationships among the secret owner, delegate candidates, and their friends.

A limitation of our work is that we only consider a small-world network topology with a homogeneous degree distribution. Future work will focus on analyzing the performance of various selection algorithms in larger, heterogeneous networks with heavy-tailed degree distributions. Additionally, we plan to study realistic cost models for adversaries and the self-healing capabilities of distributed social networks.

### Proof of Proposition 1

(i) **Monotonicity of T(n, k-1)**:
- From its definition, it follows that \( T(n, k) \geq T(n, k-1) \).
- The proof of \( T(n+1, k) \leq T(n, k) \) is also straightforward:
  \[
  T(n+1, k) - T(n, k) = t_{n+1}T(n, k) + (1 - t_{n+1})T(n, k-1) - T(n, k)
  \]
  \[
  = (1 - t_{n+1})(T(n, k-1) - T(n, k)) \leq 0
  \]
  since \( T(n, k-1) \leq T(n, k) \).

(ii) **Optimality of Delegate Set D**:
- Suppose the delegate set \( D \) has \( n \) delegates, where each \( i \in D \) has \( t_i \geq t_j \) for \( j \in [N] \setminus D \).
- Consider another delegate set \( D' \) different from \( D \) by one delegate: \( D' = \text{succ}(D) = (D \setminus \{i\}) \cup \{j\} \), where \( j \in [N] \setminus D \) and \( t_i \geq t_j \).
- We will show \( \Pr(D^c \leq k-1) \geq \Pr(D'^c \leq k-1) \):
  \[
  \Pr(D^c \leq k-1) = t_i T(n-1, k-1) + (1 - t_i) T(n-1, k-2)
  \]
  \[
  \Pr(D'^c \leq k-1) = t_j T(n-1, k-1) + (1 - t_j) T(n-1, k-1)
  \]
  Since \( T(n-1, k-1) \geq T(n-1, k-2) \) and \( t_i \geq t_j \), we have:
  \[
  \Pr(D^c \leq k-1) - \Pr(D'^c \leq k-1) = (t_i - t_j)(T(n-1, k-1) - T(n-1, k-2)) \geq 0
  \]

- More generally, for any selection \( D'' \) different from \( D \) by \( J \leq n \) users, there exist a series of delegate selections \( D_j \), \( 1 \leq j \leq J \), such that \( D'' = D_J \), \( D_{j+1} = \text{succ}(D_j) \), and \( D_1 = \text{succ}(D) \). Since \( D' = \text{succ}(D) \) implies \( \Pr(D'^c \leq k-1) < \Pr(D^c \leq k-1) \), it follows that \( \Pr(D''^c \leq k-1) < \Pr(D^c \leq k-1) \).

- Therefore, \( \Pr(D^c \leq k-1) = T(n, k-1) \) is maximized with the delegate set \( D \).

This completes the proof.
