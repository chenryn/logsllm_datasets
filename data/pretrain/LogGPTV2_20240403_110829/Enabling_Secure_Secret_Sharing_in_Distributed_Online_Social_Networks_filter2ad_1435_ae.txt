for our delegated key recovery scenario.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the ﬁrst
one applying threshold cryptography to enable private key
backup and recovery in distributed social networks. Another
novelty of this work is the proposal of appropriate trust
measures based on social relationships among users. This
solution is shown to be effective against possible infection
spreading, and resilient under presence of various malicious
nodes with different distributions.
The work most related to ours is [7], [17], where the
authors apply threshold cryptographical approaches for a
different problem on social networks. [17] considers the ap-
plication of threshold cryptographical protocols for signing
documents, which is different from ours since it requires a
user to be available to issue the digital signature. Regarding
the technical approach, our work is also different from [7],
[17]. First, we study the effectiveness of many delegate
selection approaches given the presence of various numbers
of malicious users and with possible infection spreading.
The FRIENDBASED delegate selection algorithm that we
analyzed is the same as the approach of using trusted friends
to store the cryptographical keys proposed by [17]. Second,
the adversary model we are considering is more powerful
with its capability of spreading its infection to many nodes.
Our simulations also consider many possible attack models
of the adversary. [7] proposes to create certiﬁcates based on
agreement of a number t of nodes in the network determined
dynamically. The main result is a preliminary analysis on the
probability of nodes being attacked. The issues of infection
spreading and the selection of reliable delegates, however,
are not yet studied.
In a wider context, our work is also related to credential-
based access control in P2P and social networks. Credentials
can be generated by specialized hardware such as the Trusted
Computing Platform [11], or based on certain attributes of
the requesters [10]. Most work in this direction addresses the
general problem of access control with the assumption that
access is granted to authorized users with identities known
beforehand. This assumption is not valid in our scenario of
backing up and recovery of secrets and thus these approaches
are not applicable. In other works, such as [3], [4], [6],
[10], heuristic measures are used to evaluate trust between
the resource owner and the requester before the credential
is granted. For example, [3] assigns each edge between
users a trust level and a relationship type and uses a central
node for registration and management. [6] proposes to grant
access to resources based on chain of trust relationships
between the resource owners and the requesters. An open
problem of these solution approaches is a detailed analysis
of their correctness and security under collusive attacks and
spreading of adversarial infection in the network.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The question of secure backup and recovery of secrets
in (distributed online social) systems is an important and
challenging issue. Our work provides a promising ﬁrst step
toward an appropriate technical solution to this problem.
We have studied the application of threshold-based secret
sharing protocols for this purpose and suggested potential
mechanisms to improve the security of these protocols.
Speciﬁcally, we have proposed an algorithm to select the
most reliable delegates to enable such a secure secret sharing
in a network of untrusted nodes. This approach selects
delegates based on a simple trust measure that exploits social

relationships among the secret owner, delegate candidates,
and their friends, to minimize the probability that a set
of delegates collude to steal the secret. Such an approach
has been shown to perform very well under a variety of
scenarios, even with a large number of initially malicious
users with possible spreading of infection in the network.
A limitation of this work is that we only consider a small-
world network topology with homogeneous degree distribu-
tion. It would be important to also measure and analyze
performance of various selection algorithms in larger scale
heterogeneous networks, e.g., with heavy-tailed node degree
distributions. The dynamics of networks with a growing
number of users is also an important factor yet to be studied.
As part of our future work, we plan to study realistic
cost models of an adversary to integrate with the design of
potential delegate selection mechanisms. This issue is impor-
tant since the attack by a rational adversary may be well-
related to its endured cost. The self-healing capability of the
distributed social network via the detection and cleaning of
malicious and infected nodes is also an interesting issue we
plan to study as part of future work.

PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
(i) We prove the monotonicity of T (n, k − 1) ﬁrst. The
proof for A(n, n − 2k + 1) can be done similarly. From
its deﬁnition, it follows that T (n, k) ≥ T (n, k − 1). The
proof of T (n + 1, k) ≤ T (n, k) is also trivial. In fact,
T (n + 1, k) − T (n, k) = tn+1T (n, k) + (1 − tn+1)T (n, k −
1) − T (n, k) = (1 − tn+1)(T (n, k − 1) − T (n, k)) ≤ 0, since
T (n, k − 1) ≤ T (n, k) from the above result.
(ii) Suppose that the delegate set D has n delegates, where
each i ∈ D has ti ≥ tj, j ∈ [N ] \ D.
Consider another delegate set D′ different from D by one
delegate. Deﬁne D′ = succ(D) = (D \ {i}) ∪ {j}, where
j ∈ [N ] \ D and ti ≥ tj, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. We will show
P r(Dc ≤ k − 1) ≥ P r(D′
c ≤ k − 1).
As delegates have equal roles, the order of putting a user
i in a delegate set D does not inﬂuence the probability
P r(Dc ≤ k − 1). Let us select the user i at the last step to
form the set D and select j at the last step to form D′.
It follows that P r(Dc ≤ k − 1) = tiT (n− 1, k − 1)+ (1 −
ti)T (n−1, k−2) and P r(D′
c ≤ k−1) = tjT (n−1, k−1)+
(1−tj)T (n−1, k−1). Since T (n−1, k−1) ≥ T (n−1, k−2)
according to (i), and ti ≥ tj from the deﬁnition of D′, we
have:
P r(Dc ≤ k − 1) − P r(D′
c ≤ k − 1) = (ti − tj)(T (n − 1, k − 1)
−T (n − 1, k − 2))
≥ 0
More generally, given any selection D′′ different from D
by J ≤ n users, one can verify that there exist a series of del-
egate selection Dj, 1 ≤ j ≤ J such that D′′ = DJ , Dj+1 =
succ(Dj), 1 ≤ j ≤ J − 1, and D1 = succ(D). Since
D′ = succ(D) implies P r(D′
c ≤ k − 1) < P r(Dc ≤ k − 1),
it follows that P r(D′′
c ≤ k − 1) < P r(Dc ≤ k − 1).
Therefore, P r(Dc ≤ k − 1) = T (n, k − 1) is maximized
with the delegate set D.
