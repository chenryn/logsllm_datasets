up to 10𝑀𝑊 results is a successful black start, unlike the
previous case which could handle demand increases of
20𝑀𝑊 at all the loads. Hence, an adversary requires at
least 100–200 bots/𝑀𝑊 , or in this case 30–60 thousand
bots, to increase the demand at all the loads by 10–20%
and disrupt the black start. Here again we observe that
the operational properties of the grid play an important
role in the outcome of an attack.
4.3 Line Failures and Cascades
In this subsection, we demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of
the third and the fourth variations of the MadIoT attacks
described in Section 3.2. For simulating the cascading
line failures, we use the MATLAB code developed by
Cetinay et al. [18]. We had to slightly change the code to
make it functional in the scenarios studied in this paper.
To evaluate the severity of the cascade, we deﬁne outage
as the percent of the demand aﬀected by the power outage
at the end of the cascade over the initial demand.
4.3.1 Only 10 Bots per 𝑀𝑊 Can Initiate a Cascad-
ing Failure Resulting in 86% Outage
As described in Section 3.2, once an adversary causes
a sudden increase in the demand, if it does not result in
a major frequency drop, the primary controllers at gen-
erators are automatically activated to compensate for the
imbalance in the supply and demand. Despite balancing

the supply and demand, since this balancing is unplanned,
it may cause line overloads.
To demonstrate this, we assume that an adversary in-
creases the demand at all the load buses by 1%. We also
assume that all the generators contribute proportionally
to their capacities to compensate for this sudden increase
in the demand. This attack results in a single line fail-
ure in the Polish grid 2004 but no outages. However, as
can be seen in Fig. 12, the same attack on the Polish grid
2008 results in the cascade of line failures that lasts for
5 rounds, causes 263 line failures, and 86% outage. The
1% increase in the total demand in the Polish grid 2008
is roughly equal to 210𝑀𝑊 , requiring the adversary to
access to 10 bots/𝑀𝑊 which is about 210 thousand air
conditioners in this case. This number is equal to 1.5%
of the total number of households in Poland [58].
Since the Polish grid 2004 showed a good level of ro-
bustness against the 1% increase attack, we re-evaluated
its robustness against a 10% increase in the demand.
Fig. 13 shows the resulting line failures and the subse-
quent cascade caused by this attack. It can be seen that
this attack causes much more damage with 11 line fail-

Figure 15: The cascading line failures initiated in the Polish grid
2008 by redistributing the demand by an adversary. Demand of

deviation 1𝑀𝑊 (colors show the cascade step in which a line

mand greater than 20𝑀𝑊 . This can be estimated by the
adversary from the total number of IoT bots in a city or
a town. The number of bots is correlated with the popu-
lation of an area and therefore the total demand. Hence,
an adversary detects these load buses and decreases or in-
creases the demands by a random value such that the total
demand increase and decrease sum up approximately to
zero. We assume this can be done by randomly increasing
or decreasing the demand by a Gaussian random variable
with zero mean and selected standard deviation.
Again, the Polish grid 2004 showed a great level of
robustness against these attacks. Even if an adversary
decreases or increases the demand randomly by a Gaus-
sian random variable with zero mean and standard devia-
tion 10𝑀𝑊 at loads with demand greater than 20𝑀𝑊 ,
it only results in three line failures without any outages.
However, the same attack with 10-time smaller changes,
results in serious damage to the Polish grid 2008. As
can be seen in Fig. 15, making only small changes with
standard deviation of 1𝑀𝑊 at load buses with demands
greater 20𝑀𝑊 results in cascading line failures with
77 line failures and outage of 85%. The total absolute
value of the demand changes in this attack was about
80𝑀𝑊 which means that an adversary only requires 4
bots/𝑀𝑊 , or in this case 80 thousand bots, to perform
such an attack.
Although these changes are made randomly, due to the
stealthy nature of these attacks they can be repeated with-
out attracting any attention until they are eﬀective.
4.3.3 Only 15 Bots per 𝑀𝑊 Can Fail a Tie-line by
Increasing (Decreasing) the Demand of the Im-
porting (Exporting) ISOs
In order to demonstrate an attack on the tie-lines as de-
scribed in Section 3.2, since we do not have access to the
European grid or the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, we
modiﬁed the Polish grid 2008 in a principled manner to

ures and 46% outage. Despite the eﬀectiveness of the
second attack, the Polish grid 2004 shows greater level
of robustness than the Polish grid 2008 even under a 10-
time stronger attack. Although this may be due to many
factors such as online generator locations and their val-
ues, topology of the grid, and even number of lines [54],
one possible factor is how initially saturated the power
lines are.
Fig. 14 presents the histogram of the Polish grid lines’
power ﬂow to capacity ratio in Summer 2004 compared
to Summer 2008. There are about 10% more lines with
ﬂow to capacity ratio below 0.1 in the Polish grid 2004
compared to the Polish grid 2008. Consequently, there
are more lines with power ﬂow to capacity ratio greater
than 0.3 in the Polish grid 2008 than in the Polish grid
2004 (to see the locations of the near saturated lines see
Fig. B.2 in the appendix). This clearly demonstrates that
a small increase in the demand is more likely to cause line
overloads in the Polish grid 2008 than in the Polish grid
2004 (as observed in Figs.12 and 13).
Overall, as in the previous subsection,
the results
demonstrate that the eﬀectiveness of an attack depends
on the status of the grid at the time of the attack. How-
ever, unlike the large botnet size (about 300 bots/𝑀𝑊 )
required to cause a blackout from frequency instability in
the system, we observe here that even botnet size of 10
bots/𝑀𝑊 can result in a signiﬁcant blackout depend-
ing on the grid’s operational properties. Albeit the black-
outs caused by frequency instabilities happen much faster
(within seconds) than those caused by cascading line fail-
ures (within minutes or even hours).
4.3.2 Only 4 Bots per 𝑀𝑊 Can Initiate a Cascad-
ing Failure Resulting in 85% Outage by Redis-
tributing the Demand
Another way of causing line failures and possibly cas-
cading line failures in the grid is by redistributing the
demand without increasing the total demand. As men-
tioned in Section 3.2, the advantage of this attack is that
it may have a similar eﬀect to the demand increase attack
without attracting the grid operators’ attention due to fre-
quency disturbances.
Here, an adversary focuses only on the loads with de-

represent a few neighboring ISOs in Europe connected by
a few tie-lines.
First, we used a spectral clustering method to partition
the Polish grid into 5 areas with a few connecting tie-
lines. This is done using MATLAB’s Community De-
tection Toolbox [34, 36]. Since the Polish grid does not
inherently have 5 areas, however, the number of tie-lines
between areas is slightly more than those of the European
grid or Eastern Interconnection. Therefore, we removed
one ﬁfth of the tie-lines. In order to make the power ﬂows
feasible then, we reduced the total supply and demand
by 60% and increased the capacity on the lines that were
overloaded.
Fig. 16(a) shows the modiﬁed grid along with the ratios
of tie-lines’ power ﬂows to their nominal capacities. As
can be seen, similarly to the real grid operation, some of
these tie-lines are carrying power ﬂows near their capac-
ities. These lines–which can be detected through some
of the ISOs’ websites [5]–are the most vulnerable to this
variation of the MadIoT attacks.
For example, as can be seen in Fig. 16(a), the two lines
that are connecting the yellow area to the light blue area
are carrying power ﬂows near their capacities. Therefore,
increasing the demand in the light blue area and decreas-
ing the demand in the yellow area (corresponding to the
direction of the power ﬂow on the lines) can potentially
result in those lines tripping. It can be seen in Fig. 16(b)
that a 1.5% decrease in the demand of the yellow area and
a 1.5% increase of the demand in the light blue area by
an adversary results in the failure of the two tie-lines (ad-
ditional attacks on the other tie-lines are demonstrated in
Figs. B.3(a) and B.3(b) in the appendix). Hence, an ad-
versary can cause a failure in a tie-line by only a botnet
of size 15 bots/𝑀𝑊 , or in this case 60 thousand bots (30
thousand bots at each end of the tie-line).
Since the tie-lines usually carry substantial amounts of
power, failure in these lines can result in cascade of line
failures in other lines and eventually in disconnection of
an ISO from the interconnection. Such a disconnection

may result in a huge imbalance in the supply and demand
values and in uncontrollable frequency drop leading to an
inevitable blackout.
Attacks on the tie-lines are an eﬀective approach when
an adversary has a limited number of bots. By discon-
necting an ISO from its neighboring ISOs, an adversary
can cause a huge demand deﬁcit in the targeted ISO and
possibly a large-scale blackout.
4.4
Increasing the Operating Cost
In this ﬁnal subsection, we evaluate the last variation of
the MadIoT attacks described in Section 3.2. In this vari-
ation of the attacks, an adversary increases the demand
not to necessarily cause a blackout, but rather to signiﬁ-
cantly increase the operating cost of the grid in favor of a
utility in the electricity market.
4.4.1
50 Bots per 𝑀𝑊 Can Increase the Operating
Cost by 20%
For these simulations, we use the Polish grid in Sum-
mer 2004. However, in order to mainly focus on the cost
related issues, we increase the line capacities to make sure
that the attack causes no line overloads. To simulate the
system in its peak demand state, we increase the initial
demand by 10% to make the demand before the attack
close to the online generators’ generation capacity.
We assume that the sudden increase in the demand
caused by the attack can temporarily be handled by the
primary controller and no large frequency drops as in
Section 4.2 happen in any of the scenarios here. There-
fore, our focus is on the cost of the required reserve gen-
erators for providing the additional power and returning
the system’s frequency back to 60𝐻 𝑧 (or 50𝐻 𝑧).
We consider two cases, one with 5 reserve generators,
and the other one with 10. We also consider two possible
cost functions for the reserve generators: 𝑐1(𝑥) = 100𝑥
and 𝑐2(𝑥) = 5𝑥2 + 100𝑥, in which 𝑥 is in 𝑀𝑊 and the
𝑐𝑖(𝑥)s are in $∕ℎ𝑟. The linear and quadratic cost func-
tions are the most common functions for approximating
the generation costs [62, Chapter 3]. The 𝑐1(𝑥) is selected
26    27th USENIX Security Symposium

similarly to cost function of the high-cost online genera-
tors in the grid before the attack and the 𝑐2(𝑥) is selected
to capture the start-up cost of the reserve generators as
well as their higher cost compared to the online genera-
tors.
Fig. 17 shows the increase in the total cost given the
two cost functions. As can be seen, in the worst-case sce-
nario, a 5% increase in the demand–which requires 50
bots/𝑀𝑊 , or in this case 1 million bots–can result in
about a 20% increase in the operating cost of the grid
(see the yellow line in Fig. 17(b)). This is four times
higher than the best-case scenario (see the orange line in
Fig. 17(a)) which is similar to the normal increase in the
operating cost when no reserve generators are needed.
We observe that the eﬀectiveness of the attack in in-
creasing the cost depends on the total number of reserve
generators as well as their generation cost functions.
5 Countermeasure Sketches
Although we are not aware of any rigorous counter-
measures against the MadIoT attacks, in this section, we
brieﬂy provide a set of suggestions both in the power grid
operation side and in the IoT design side to reduce the ef-
fectiveness of these attacks.
5.1 Power Grid Side
One of the most important properties of the MadIoT
attacks, as mentioned in Section 3.3, is that grid op-
