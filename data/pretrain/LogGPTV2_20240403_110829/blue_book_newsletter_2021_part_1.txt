# [Introduction](index.md)
* New: Simplify the landing page text.
* Reorganization: Merge the Meta article into the index.
# [Projects](projects.md)
* Improvement: [Add mkdocs-newsletter as a dormant plant.](projects.md#mkdocs-newsletter)
    MkDocs plugin to show the changes of documentation repositories in
    a user friendly format, at the same time that it's easy for the authors
    to maintain.
    It creates daily, weekly, monthly and yearly newsletter articles with
    the changes of each period. Those pages, stored under the `Newsletters`
    section, are filled with the changes extracted from the commit messages
    of the git history.  The changes are grouped by categories,
    subcategories and then by file using the order of the site's navigation
    structure. RSS feeds are also created for each newsletter type, so it's
    easy for people to keep updated with the evolution of the site.
* Reorganization: Update and reorganize projects.
    Following the [digital garden](digital_garden.md) metaphor
* Reorganization: [Merge the wish_list article into the projects.](projects.md#seeds)
* New: Add seed to follow the updates of software.
* New: Add seed to automatically update the dockers of maintained services.
* Improvement: Explain the updates on the repository-orm project.
    In the latest version `0.2.0`, we added:
    * Support for the [TinyDB repository](https://lyz-code.github.io/repository-orm/tinydb_repository/).
    * Support for regular expressions in the `search` method.
    * Easier repository loading with `load_repository` function.
* Improvement: Add a link to the meilisearch [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/).
* New: Create the quantified self project.
    With links to the two starting points [HPI](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html) and [bionic](https://github.com/bionic-dev/bionic).
* New: [Sketch how to automate repetitive tasks prompted by email events.](projects.md#automate-email-management)
    Most of the emails I receive require repetitive actions that can be automated,
    I've stumbled upon [notmuchmail](https://notmuchmail.org/), which looks very
    promising. A friend suggested to use
    [afew](https://afew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tagging, and I'd probably use
    [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) to interact with the system (and finally be
    able to use email from the cli).
* Improvement: [Add interesting interface.](projects.md#quantified-self)
    For the interface [adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex) looks awesome!
    It's inspired in the Andrew Louis [talk Building
    a Memex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWxvQn4cf8&t=1616s) whose [blog
    posts](https://hyfen.net/memex/) seems to be a gold mine.
    Also look at [hpi's compilation](https://github.com/hpi/hpi).
* New: [Sketch how to improve the launching of applications with i3wm.](projects.md#improve-the-way-of-launching-applications-with-i3wm)
    In the past I tried installing [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
    without success, I should try again. If the default features are not enough,
    check [adi1090x's custom resources](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).
* Improvement: [Show the changes of repository-orm 0.3.1.](projects.md#repository-orm)
    +* Add `first` and `last` methods to the repositories.
    +* Make entity `id_` definition optional.
    +* add `_model_name` attribute to entities.
* Improvement: [Add woop awesome quantified self resources to the research list.](projects.md#quantified-self)
* New: [Add project to migrate software bug tracker to a vendor free one like `git-bug`.](projects.md#migrate-software-bug-tracker-to-a-vendor-free-one)
* New: [Improve the notification management in Linux.](projects.md#improve-the-notification-management-in-linux)
    Create new seed project to be able to group and silence the notifications under a custom logic.
    For example:
    * If I want to focus on a task, only show the most important ones.
    * Only show alerts once every X minutes. Or define that I want to receive them
        the first 10 minutes of every hour.
    * If I'm not working, silence all work alerts.
* New: [Improve the hard drive monitor system.](projects.md#improve-the-hard-drive-monitor-system)
    Create new seed project to use something like [scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) (there's a [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-scrutiny)) to collect and display the information. For alerts, use one of their [supported providers](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny#notifications).
* New: [Aggregate all notifications.](projects.md#aggregate-all-notifications)
    Instead of reading the email, github, gitlab, discourse, reddit notifications,
    aggregate all in one place and show them to the user in a nice command line
    interface.
    For the aggregator server, my first choice would be [gotify](https://gotify.net/).
* New: [Add faker-optional to the dormant plant projects.](projects.md#faker-optional)
* New: [Add seedling project to create factoryboy factories from pydantic models automatically.](projects.md#other)
* New: [Explain the idea of how to improve the record of ideas, tasks,.](projects.md#inbox-management)
* New: Add git-bug as an interesting distributed issue tracker.
* New: [Add the Improve the reliability of the Open Science collections project.](projects.md#improve-the-reliability-of-the-open-science-collections)
    The current [free knowledge efforts](free_knowledge.md): are based on the health
    of a collection of torrents. This project aims to create a command line
    tool or service that makes it easier to automate the seeding of ill
    torrents.
* New: [Add the Monitor and notify on disk prices project.](projects.md#monitor-and-notify-on-disk-prices)
    [Diskprices.com](https://diskprices.com/) sorts the prices of the disks on the
    different amazon sites based on many filters. It will be interesting to have
    a service that monitors the data on this site and alerts the user once there is
    a deal that matches its criteria.
* Reorganization: [Move the automation of computer file management project to the projects page.](projects.md#automating-computer-file-management)
* Reorganization: Move the dying projects below the seeds as they are less important.
* New: [Introduce seedling self-hosted map project.](projects.md#self-hosted-map)
    I love maps, as well as traveling and hiking. This project aims to create a web
    interface that let's me interact with the data gathered throughout my life. I'd
    like to:
    * Browse the waypoints and routes that I've done.
    * Create routes and export the gpx.
    * Be able to search through the data
    * Plan trips
* New: [Introduce the seed project to.](projects.md#switch-to-a-better-browser)
* New: [Add the Life seedling project.](projects.md#life)
    Life is a real time sandbox role game where you play as yourself surviving in today's
    world.
* New: [Add bruty to the dormant plant projects.](projects.md#bruty)
    [bruty](https://github.com/lyz-code/bruty) is a Python program to bruteforce dynamic web applications with Selenium.
* Improvement: Add rsarai hq to interesting sources for lifelogging.
* New: [Introduce pynbox the inbox management tool.](projects.md#pynbox)
    [Pynbox](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox) is a tool to improve the
    management of ideas, tasks, references, suggestions when I'm not in
    front of the computer. Right now I've got Markor for Android to register
    these quicknotes, but the reality is that I don't act upon them, so it's
    just a log of tasks that never get done, and ideas, references and
    suggestions that aren't registered in my knowledge or media management
    systems.
    On the computer there are also cases of tasks that are not worth registering in
    the task management system, or ideas that I get at a moment but don't have time
    to process at the moment.
    The idea then is to automatically sync the Android quicknote with syncthing,
    and have a special format for the file that allows [`pynbox`](https://lyz-code.github.io/pynbox)
    to extract
    the elements from that file to the "inbox system". For example:
    +
    ```
    t. buy groceries
    tv. IT crowd
    i. Improve the inbox management
    I want a system to improve ...
    ```
    Gets introduced in the "inbox system" as a task, a TV suggestion and an idea.
* New: Introduce nyxt as a solution for a better browser.
    I've just stumbled upon [nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/)
    ([code](https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt)), and it looks superb.
* New: [Introduce the shared accounting seed project.](projects.md#shared-accounting)
    I use [beancount](beancount.md) for my personal accounting, I'd like to have
    a system that integrates more less easily with beancount and let's do a shared
    accounting with other people, for example in trips. I've used [settle
    up](https://settleup.io/) in the past but it requires access to their servers,
    and an account linked to google, facebook or one you register in their servers.
    I've looked at [facto](https://github.com/nymanjens/facto) but it uses a logic
    that doesn't apply to my case, it does a heavy use on a common account, instead
    +of minimizing the transactions between the people. I also tried
    [tabby](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby#installation), even though they
    still [don't support Docker](https://github.com/bertvandepoel/tabby/issues/13),
    but it doesn't suit my case either :(.
    Until a new solution shows up, I'll go with [Tricky
    Tripper](https://github.com/koelleChristian/trickytripper) available in F-Droid,
    and manage the expenses myself and periodically send the html reports to the
    rest of the group.
* Improvement: Add quickwit as an interesting database solution for personal knowledge search engine.
* New: [Promote the automation of email management project to seedling.](projects.md#automate-email-management)
* New: [Introduce the pomodoro command line seed project.](projects.md#pomodoro-command-line)
    Command line to help with the [pomodoro workflow](life_planning.md#pomodoro), besides the basic stuff it will interact with the task manager, [activitywatch](activitywatch.md) and the notifications system.
* New: [Introduce the ordered list of digital gardens project.](projects.md#create-an-ordered-list-of-digital-gardens)
    Use [best-of-lists](https://github.com/best-of-lists/best-of) to create an
    awesome list of digital gardens.
* Correction: Clean up deprecated projects.
* New: [Add seed to self host a routing web application.](projects.md#self-host-a-routing-web-application)
    Host and play around with [brouter](https://github.com/abrensch/brouter) and
    [brouter-web](https://github.com/nrenner/brouter-web).
# [Activism](anonymous_feedback.md)
* New: Introduce the anonymous feedback tool to improve diversity, equity and inclusion in an organization.
    Anonymous Feedback is a communication tool where people share feedback to
    teammates or other organizational members while protecting their identities.
    Until the safe space is built where direct feedback is viable, anonymous
    feedback gives these employees a mechanism to raise their concerns, practice their
    feedback-giving skills, test the waters, and understand how people perceive
    their constructive (and sometimes critical) opinions, thus building the needed
    trust.
* New: Define Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.
    * *Diversity* is the representation and acknowledgement of the multitudes of
        identities, experiences, and ways of moving through the world. This
        includes—but is not limited to—ability, age, citizenship status, criminal
        record and/or incarceration, educational attainment, ethnicity, gender,
        geographical location, language, nationality, political affiliation,
        religion, race, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and veteran status.
        Further, we recognize that each individual's experience is informed by
        intersections across multiple identities.
    * *Equity*  seeks to ensure respect and equal opportunity for all, using all
        resources and tools to elevate the voices of under-represented and/or
        disadvantaged groups.
    * *Inclusion* is fostering an environment in which people of all identities are
        welcome, valued, and supported. An inclusive organization solicits, listens
        to, learns from, and acts on the contributions of all its stakeholders.
* New: Introduce Anti-transphobia.
    Anti-transphobia being reductionist is the opposition to the collection of ideas
    and phenomena that encompass a range of negative attitudes, feelings or actions
    towards transgender people or transness in general. Transphobia can include
    fear, aversion, hatred, violence, anger, or discomfort felt or expressed towards
    people who do not conform to social gender expectations. It is often expressed
    alongside homophobic views and hence is often considered an aspect of
    homophobia.
* New: [Introduce arguments against terf ideology.](antitransphobia.md#terf)
    [TERF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TERF) is an acronym for *trans-exclusionary
    radical feminist*. The term originally applied to the minority of feminists that
    expressed transphobic sentiments such as the rejection of the assertion that
    trans women are women, the exclusion of trans women from women's spaces, and
    opposition to transgender rights legislation. The meaning has since expanded to
    refer more broadly to people with trans-exclusionary views who may have no
    involvement with radical feminism.
## [Antifascism](antifascism.md)
* New: Introduce antifascism.
    Antifascism is a method of politics, a locus of individual and group
    self-indentification, it's a transnational movement that adapted preexisting
    socialist, anarchist, and communist currents to a sudden need to react to the
    fascist menace ([Mark p. 11](#references)). It's based on the idea that [any
    oppression form](#how-to-identify-fascism) can't be allowed, and should be
    actively fought with whatever means are necessary.
### [Antifascist Actions](antifascist_actions.md)
* New: [A fake company and five million recycled flyers.](antifascist_actions.md#a-fake-company-and-five-million-recycled-flyers)
    A group of artists belonging to the [Center for political
    beauty](https://politicalbeauty.com/) created a fake company [Flyerservice
    Hahn](https://www.flyerservice-hahn.de/) and convinced more than 80 regional
    sections of the far right party AfD to hire them to deliver their electoral
    propaganda.
    They gathered five million flyers, with a total weight of 72 tons. They justify
    that they wouldn't be able to lie to the people, so they did nothing in the
    broader sense of the word. They declared that they are the ["world wide leader in
    the non-delivery of nazi
    propaganda"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcBVq-PtrpY). At the start of the
    electoral campaign, they went to the AfD stands, and they let their members to
    give them flyers the throw them to the closest bin. "It's something that any
    citizen can freely do, we have only industrialized the process".
    They've done a [crowdfunding](https://afd-muell.de/) to fund the legal process
    that may result.
## Feminism
### [Privileges](privileges.md)
* New: Feminist analysis of privileges and rights.
    Privileges are a group of special structural benefits, social advantages, that a group
    holds over another. So they are elements that should be removed from our lives.
    Some of the topics included are:
    * What's the difference between privilege and right
    * [What can we do to fight the privileges?](privileges.md#what-can-we-do-to-fight-the-privileges)
## [Free Knowledge](free_knowledge.md)
* New: Introduce how to contribute to the free knowledge initiative.
    One of the early principles of the internet has been to make knowledge free to everyone. [Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan) of [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.do/), bookwarrior of [Library Genesis](https://libgen.fun/), [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), and countless unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers.  Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment, and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open Science.
    If you want to know how to contribute, check the [article](free_knowledge.md).
# [Life Management](life_management.md)
* Reorganization: Split the life automation article into life management and process automation.
    I understand life management as the act of analyzing yourself and your
    interactions with the world to define processes and automations that shape the
    way to efficiently achieve your goals.
    I understand process automation as the act of analyzing yourself and your
    interactions with the world to find the way to reduce the time or willpower
    spent on your life processes.
## [Time Management](time_management.md)
* New: Introduce the time management concept.
    [Time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) is the process
    of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific
    activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity.
    It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work,
    social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the
    finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending
    or managing activities at their own time and expediency.
* New: Start analyzing the ways to reduce the time spent doing unproductive tasks.
    By [minimizing the context switches](time_management.md#minimize-the-context-switches) and [managing the interruptions](time_management.md#interruption-management).
* Improvement: [Explain how to improve your efficiency by better using your everyday tools.](time_management.md#tool-management)
* Improvement: Add two more ways to avoid loosing time in unproductive tasks.
    * [Avoid lost time doing nothing](time_management.md#avoid-lost-time-doing-nothing).
    * [Fix your environment](time_management.md#fix-your-environment).
* New: [Explain how to manage meetings efficiently.](time_management.md#meetings)
* New: [Explain how to improve efficiency by taking care of yourself.](time_management.md#improve-your-state)
* New: [Explain how to prevent blocks by efficiently switching mental processes.](time_management.md#don't-wait,-switch-task)
## [Task Management](task_management.md)
* New: Introduce the task management concept.
    [Task management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management) is the process
    of managing a task through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing,
    tracking, and reporting. Task management can help either individual achieve
    goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the
    accomplishment of collective goals.
* Improvement: Introduce the main task management tools.
    The [inbox](task_management.md#inbox) does not refer only to your e-mail
    inbox. It is a broader concept that includes all the elements you have
    collected in different ways: tasks you have to do, ideas you have
    thought of, notes, bills, business cards, etc…
