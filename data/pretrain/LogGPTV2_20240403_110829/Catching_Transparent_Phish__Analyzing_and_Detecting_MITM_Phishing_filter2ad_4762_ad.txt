By utilizing WHOIS information, we are able to determine how
long domains associated with MITM phishing websites were active,
before they were discovered by our crawlers (Figure 8a). We find
that most domains associated with MITM phishing websites were
registered within the year prior to detection with 45.3% of domains
being registered in the week of their detection.
Additionally, due to our infrastructure’s re-crawling module,
can determine the life cycle of MITM phishing websites from their
creation to deletion. As mentioned in Section 4.1, when our data
collection infrastructure receives a potential phishing domain from
Certificate Transparency, it recrawls that domain every 3-6 hours
(depending on the load of our system) for the following 2 days.
Thus, we are able to determine how long it takes for a MITM phish-
ing website to be ready to receive requests from victims after its
certificate is created. Moreover, as our system continually recrawls
all positively labeled MITM phishing websites, we are able to deter-
mine the amount of time these sites remain online after they are first
observed. Figure 8b shows the number of hours it took MITM phish-
ing websites in our dataset to come online after the creation of their
TLS certificates. We find that all MITM phishing websites respond
to requests within one day, with over 90% responding immediately.
Phishing campaigns utilizing traditional methods and tools are
typically short lived, staying online for less than one day on aver-
age [52]. Given the fidelity of content that MITM phishing toolkits
present to users in addition to their post-authentication operation
and built-in evasion mechanisms (described in Section 3.2), we ex-
pect that the lifespan of such websites is higher than traditional
phishing campaigns. Figure 8c shows the number of days MITM
phishing websites in our dataset remain online after first discovery.

We find that over 40% of MITM phishing websites in our dataset
remain online for more than one day, with approximately 15% re-
maining online for over 20 days.
Targeted Brands and Phishing Campaigns
Through analysis of passive DNS data, we find that 339 (27%) do-
mains associated with MITM phishing toolkits in our dataset are
co-located on the same IP address as a benign domain, and 23
domains are co-located with at least one other domain tagged as
malicious by the domain blocklists reported by VirusTotal. This in-
dicates that attackers typically acquire dedicated infrastructure, or
reuse existing malicious infrastructure, for their campaigns rather
than compromise existing domains. This contrasts prior work on
traditional phishing campaigns which report that half of all phish-
ing domains resolve to IP addresses of legitimate websites [31].
Over the course of our study, we discovered 19 trademarks tar-
geted by MITM phishing toolkits. However, we find that a subset
of brands are disproportionately targeted—the top five most tar-
geted attracting 67.1% of all MITM phishing websites in our dataset.
Table 4 shows the number of MITM phishing websites discovered
together with example impersonating domains targeting popu-
lar trademarks in our dataset. Furthermore, Figure 9 presents the
distributions of impersonating domain types targeting the most
popular trademarks we monitor. The domain names associated
with MITM phishing toolkits we observed fall into three categories:
combosquatting (e.g. paypalhelp.com), target embedding (e.g. lo-
gin.paypal.com.attacker.com), and typosquatting (e.g. paypl.com).
Domain distributions can vary greatly depending on the trademark,
where domains impersonating Yahoo were almost entirely target

4.3 Case Study: MITM
Phishing Attacks in an Enterprise Setting
To study the real-world effects of MITM phishing attacks and com-
pare the performance of our detection infrastructure to a com-
mercial phishing detection solution, we partnered with Palo Alto
Networks (PAN). Their in-line vantage points to network commu-
nications and large enterprise-customer base provides detailed in-
sights into real world phishing attacks. While PAN deploys various
web scanners and state-of-the-art phishing detection techniques,
we show that our solution adds a significant amount of exclusive
detections to their phishing coverage.
We provided a list of all 1,220 MITM phishing hostnames to PAN
to determine when each was active based on entries from their anti-
phishing database, and to enrich their database with new phishing
URLs. In total, we find that 57.6% of MITM phishing domains discov-
ered by our infrastructure were labeled as either explicitly malicious
or highly likely to be malicious by PAN scanners. Furthermore, of
the domains listed as such, 15.1% were given their respective label
at least one week after our infrastructure discovered it.
PAN researchers investigated the remaining URLs (42.4%) that
were absent from their anti-phishing database and found one of the
reasons to be cloaking mechanisms of the MITM phishing toolkits
preventing their scanners from observing malicious content. In par-
ticular, they observed a campaign redirecting towards legitimate
URLs of streaming services, either not being weaponized at the time
of the analysis or not detected due to cloaking. Moreover, by using
our tool, PAN found another two phishing hostnames targeting
their users with a similar cloaking behavior. These results highlight
that content-based phishing detection techniques can be thwarted
by cloaking. However, our methodology mitigates these issues by
focusing entirely on network-level features. After conclusion of this
experiment, PAN is implementing PHOCA into their infrastructure
in order to capture future MITM phishing toolkit instances.
In addition, we observe that enterprise users are currently being
targeted by MITM phishing toolkits. PAN provided us with statistics
on the number of their clients that visited each MITM phishing web-
site. Over a 6 month period they captured 6,403 requests directed
towards 260 of our identified MITM phishing websites, logged from
368 distinct firewall devices. On average, each MITM phishing web-
site received 25 requests (as recorded by PAN’s middleware), with
the most popular site receiving 4,728 requests by their clients. We
find that attacks from MITM phishing toolkits are prevalent in the
wild and are currently affecting real users. Moreover, while MITM
phishing toolkits by their nature are geared towards highly-targeted
attacks, some real world attacks result in large numbers of users
falling victim.

trademarks in our dataset.
embedding, while 70% of Paypal domains were combosquatting.
Finally, Table 5 shows the distribution of top-level domains (TLDs)
in our dataset. We observe that the domains with the .com TLD are
the most common. Since gTLDs typically require substantial costs
to register, their common presence in our dataset suggests that the
discovered MTIM phishing toolkits were used in real (and most
likely targeted) phishing attacks where believability of the domain
is vital and therefore justify the increased domain-registration costs.
Phishing Blocklist Presence
By querying popular phishing blocklists, we discover that most
MITM phishing websites our crawler discovered are missing from
these lists. In total, only 43.7% of positively labeled URLs in our
dataset are listed as malicious by at least one domain blocklist re-
ported by VirusTotal [25]. Furthermore, it takes on average seven
days after our crawlers discover a MITM phishing website, for these
URLs to be labeled as such. This is substantially longer than tra-
ditional phishing campaigns, which previous work has shown are
detected by blocklists after only nine hours [52]. Additionally, we
find that only 18.9% of IP addresses associated with MITM phishing
toolkits appear on at least one IP blocklist reported by VirusTotal.
This suggests that attackers use fresh IP addresses and domains to
launch attacks and quickly move before they are discovered.
MITM Phishing Toolkit Cloaking
Our results demonstrate that due to cloaking and their highly-
targeted nature, the phishing websites supported by MITM phishing
toolkits are able to remain hidden from the scanners that feed popu-
lar blocklists. This affords attackers with more time to inflict damage
on a greater number of victims and decreased resource costs.
Our use of domain names from Certificate Transparency pre-
vents us from obtaining the tokenized URLs, and in turn, seeing
phishing content from Evilginx deployments (described in Sec-
tion 3.2). Thus, we observed a diverse set of cloaking responses
to requests towards MITM phishing websites in the wild. Of the
1,220 MITM websites discovered, 14.8% did not perform any cloak-
ing, 19% redirected visitors to the legitimate website of the victim
service (e.g. a phishing page targeting PayPal redirecting users to
the real PayPal website), and 66.2% redirected visitors to arbitrary
destinations, such as, pages served by google.com.

FINGERPRINTING
In previous sections, we showed that it is possible to fingerprint
deployments of MITM phishing toolkits from the point of view of a
client. Even though this fingerprinting is valuable because it allows
scanning tools to now identify these types of toolkits in the wild,
the users who are targeted by these campaigns will not benefit from
this fingerprinting until these sites are added to popular blocklists.
In this section, we explore the fingerprintability of these MITM
phishing toolkits, from the perspective of the target web server. A
web server that is able to differentiate between benign requests and
those originating from a MITM phishing toolkit will be able to flag
the latter and protect end users, even if these users are not aware
that they are interacting with a MITM phishing server.
5.1 TLS Fingerprinting
Since data in the application layer is under complete control of the
attacker, classic browser-fingerprinting methods will not suffice
to determine the presence of a MITM phishing toolkit from the
perspective of a targeted web server. For instance, as all JavaScript
is executed on the victim’s device, fingerprinting scripts would
return information about the victim rather than the toolkit.
We therefore seek to fingerprint MITM phishing toolkits at the
TLS layer of the network stack. These toolkits are built for the
explicit purpose of phishing authentication details and do not make
use of typical web-client software. As a result, the TLS stacks uti-
lized to communicate with target servers are not the common stacks
that web servers typically observe from their users. Additionally,
since these toolkits forward all HTTP request headers to the target
web server, there are discrepancies in the TLS fingerprint when
compared to the reported device and browser in the User-Agent.
To determine the uniqueness of the TLS implementations of
the MITM phishing toolkits studied, we implemented a web page
that records the HTTP request headers, IP address, and JA3 TLS
Fingerprint [10] of each client. JA3 fingerprints are created by con-
catenating each field of the TLS Client Hello packet and computing
the hash of the resulting string. This produces a unique identifier
which can be used to tag TLS implementations and identify clients.
To characterize the distribution of TLS stacks of regular users,
we purchased 13,000 advertising impressions from a popular adver-
tising service. For each impression, the user’s browser connects to
a server under our control over the HTTPS protocol, allowing us
to obtain the aforementioned TLS fingerprint as well as the user’s
HTTP User-agent header. Our web page contained a simple mes-
sage that was completely unrelated to our study. Specifically, the
web page echoed CDC guidelines related to curbing the transmis-
sion of COVID-19, i.e., encouraging users to wash their hands and
practice social distancing. We did not ask users to provide any input
(PII or otherwise), did not offer downloads, and did not send them
any cookies or JavaScript code during these interactions.
5.2 Server Side TLS Fingerprinting Results
Through this process, we recorded 163 JA3 TLS fingerprints of
various clients, corresponding to 4,311 distinct HTTP User-Agents.
The distribution of device platforms and browsers of our TLS fin-
gerprinting dataset is presented in Table 6. Our dataset consists

and browser, as reported via User-Agent headers.
