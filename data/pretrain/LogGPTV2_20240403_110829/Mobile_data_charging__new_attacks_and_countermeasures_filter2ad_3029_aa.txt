## Abstract

3G/4G cellular networks employ usage-based charging, where mobile users are billed based on the volume of data they consume. In this study, we evaluate the security of the metered accounting architecture and application-specific charging policies implemented by operators. We have identified several vulnerabilities and discovered two new attacks that exploit these weaknesses. The "toll-free-data-access-attack" allows an attacker to access any data service without incurring charges. The "stealth-spam-attack" can generate a large volume of traffic directed at a victim, who may remain unaware of the spam. Our experiments on two operational 3G networks confirm the feasibility and simplicity of these attacks. We also propose effective countermeasures.

## 1. Introduction

The widespread adoption of 3G/4G cellular networks has made wireless internet access increasingly popular. According to OECD statistics, 62% of broadband users in the US had subscribed to wireless data plans as of June 2010, with 137 million subscribers. Globally, there are 1.2 billion mobile web users. The rapid growth of smartphones (e.g., iPhones and Android phones) is further accelerating this trend.

While users enjoy the convenience of wireless data, it comes at a cost. Most 3G/4G operators charge based on data usage, as stipulated by the 3G/4G standards. This metered charging is performed within the cellular network (CN) on a per-flow basis, where each flow is defined by the five-tuple (source-IP, destination-IP, source-port, destination-port, protocol). When a data flow is initiated, the CN records the traffic volume, performing accounting based on observed traffic. Operators can also define specific billing policies for different types of flows.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of the 3G/4G charging system, identifying vulnerabilities in both policy and architecture. We describe two new types of attacks: the "toll-free data access attack" and the "stealth spam attack." The toll-free data access attack exploits policy loopholes, allowing attackers to use data services without being charged. The stealth spam attack injects large volumes of spam data into a victim's device, even after the device has terminated its data service, exploiting architectural weaknesses and features of instant messaging applications. Our experiments on two operational 3G networks demonstrate the feasibility and simplicity of these attacks, and the potential for significant undercharging or overcharging.

Our main contributions are:
1. The first security analysis of the 3G/4G network charging system, identifying key vulnerabilities.
2. Description of two new attacks and their validation through real-world experiments.
3. Identification of the root causes of these vulnerabilities and proposed countermeasures.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the 3G/4G architecture and data charging system. Section 3 analyzes the vulnerabilities in mobile data charging. Sections 4 and 5 describe the toll-free data access attack and stealth spam attack, along with countermeasures. Section 6 compares our work with related research, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Data Charging Architecture

Figure 1 illustrates the 3G UMTS network architecture and charging system for data services. The UMTS network consists of the Terrestrial Radio Access Network (RAN) and the core network (CN). RAN provides wireless access to the mobile device (User Equipment, UE), while the PS core network handles data session provisioning.

The major components of the PS core network are the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). SGSN manages data packet delivery within its geographical area, and GGSN acts as a router between the SGSN and the external Internet. Both SGSN and GGSN record data usage for charging purposes.

Current cellular networks support both offline and online charging modes. Offline charging involves collecting data usage in the form of Charging Data Records (CDRs), which are sent to the Billing Domain (BD) for generating bills. Online charging requires pre-payment, and the Online Charging System (OCS) authorizes and deducts data usage from available credits.

### 2.2 Data Charging Procedures

We illustrate the charging procedures using an example. Consider Alice browsing CNN news, initiating a PS service (HTTP). Figure 2 shows the steps involved:

1. **Bearer Establishment**: Alice establishes a bearer via PDP Context Activation, allowing her to connect to the external data network through SGSN and GGSN.
2. **Charging ID Assignment**: GGSN assigns a unique charging ID to the activated PDP context.
3. **CDR Creation**: SGSN and GGSN start creating CDRs and prepare to record data volume.
4. **Data Service**: Alice reads CNN news, and SGSN and GGSN route data packets and record traffic volume.
5. **Accounting**: The accounting procedure continues until the data service completes, either when the bearer is torn down or the HTTP session is closed.
6. **CDR Closure and Transfer**: CDRs are closed and transferred to the BD for billing.

The online charging process is similar, with OCS participating in the triggering and accounting steps.

## 3. Vulnerability Analysis of Mobile Data Charging

### 3.1 Toll-Free Data Access Attack

This attack exploits policy loopholes, allowing attackers to access data services without incurring charges. For example, if an operator offers free DNS service, an attacker can manipulate the DNS queries to access other data services for free.

### 3.2 Stealth Spam Attack

This attack injects large volumes of spam data into a victim's device, even after the device has terminated its data service. It exploits the lack of feedback from the user in the charging decision-making process and the features of instant messaging applications like Skype and Google Talk.

### 3.3 Experimental Validation

Our experiments on two operational 3G networks confirmed the feasibility and simplicity of these attacks. The potential for unbounded undercharging or overcharging was also demonstrated.

## 4. Toll-Free Data Access Attack

### 4.1 Attack Mechanism

The toll-free data access attack manipulates the policy loopholes in the operator's charging system. By exploiting free services, such as DNS, an attacker can access other data services without being charged.

### 4.2 Countermeasures

To mitigate this attack, operators should:
- Implement more robust policy enforcement.
- Monitor and detect unusual patterns of data usage.
- Use encryption and authentication to secure data flows.

## 5. Stealth Spam Attack

### 5.1 Attack Mechanism

The stealth spam attack injects large volumes of spam data into a victim's device, even after the device has terminated its data service. This attack exploits the lack of user feedback in the charging process and the features of instant messaging applications.

### 5.2 Countermeasures

To mitigate this attack, operators should:
- Implement feedback mechanisms to involve the user in the charging decision.
- Use intrusion detection systems to identify and block spam traffic.
- Enhance the security of instant messaging applications.

## 6. Related Work

### 6.1 Comparison with Previous Research

Previous studies have focused on various aspects of cellular network security, but none have comprehensively analyzed the vulnerabilities in the 3G/4G charging system. Our work fills this gap by providing a detailed security analysis and proposing effective countermeasures.

## 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented the first comprehensive security analysis of the 3G/4G charging system, identifying key vulnerabilities and describing two new types of attacks. Our experiments confirmed the feasibility and simplicity of these attacks, and we proposed effective countermeasures. A dependable, metered charging system requires coordinated efforts among the mobile device, the network, and applications, with robust security mechanisms to strengthen every part of the system.
