Opening files compressed with UglifyJS or YUI compressor, which put everything
on 1 line, can take seconds, even for small files (<100kb). Pasting a line
like that into an already open file can also freeze things up. I guess syntax
highlighting might have a problem dealing with the long lines.
If it's the syntax highlighting, perhaps that can kick in later so the file
can at least be displayed within a reasonable time? Maybe it's a more
fundamental problem. It just doesn't feel right to wait around 4 seconds for a
100kb file to load.
