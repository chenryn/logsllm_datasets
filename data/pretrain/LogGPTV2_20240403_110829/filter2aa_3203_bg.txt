### Single-Label, Unqualified Domain Name Resolution

The resolution of a single-label, unqualified domain name is based on the settings in the "Append primary and connection specific DNS suffixes" and "Append these suffixes" check boxes on the DNS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box for Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).

1. **Primary and Connection-Specific DNS Suffixes:**
   - If the "Append primary and connection specific DNS suffixes" check box is selected, the resolver appends the following names and sends separate queries:
     - The primary DNS suffix, as specified on the Computer Name tab of the System item in Control Panel.
     - Each connection-specific DNS suffix, which can be assigned through DHCP or specified in the DNS suffix for this connection box on the DNS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box for each connection.

2. **Parent Suffixes of the Primary DNS Suffix:**
   - If resolution is still not successful and the "Append parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix" check box is selected, the resolver creates new fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) by appending the single-label, unqualified domain name with the parent suffix of the primary DNS suffix name, and the parent of that suffix, and so on, stopping at the second-level domain name. This process is known as name devolution.
   - For example, if the application specifies the name `emailsrv7` and the primary DNS suffix is `central.example.com.`, the resolver tries to resolve the FQDNs `emailsrv7.central.example.com.` and `emailsrv7.example.com.`.

3. **Search List Suffixes:**
   - If resolution is still not successful and the "Append these suffixes" check box is selected, the resolver appends each suffix from the search list in order and submits the FQDN to the DNS server until it finds a match or reaches the end of the list.
   - For example, if the application specifies the name `filesrv11` and the DNS suffix list consists of `admin.wcoast.example.com.`, `admin.ecoast.example.com.`, and `admin.central.example.com.`, the resolver tries the FQDNs `filesrv11.admin.wcoast.example.com.`, `filesrv11.admin.ecoast.example.com.`, and `filesrv11.admin.central.example.com.`.

### Multiple-Label, Unqualified Domain Names

When an application specifies a multiple-label, unqualified domain name, the DNS resolver uses the same process as that for a single-label, unqualified domain name to resolve the name.

### DNS Server Service in Windows

The DNS Server service in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 supports the following features:

1. **Internet Standards-Compliant DNS Server:**
   - The DNS Server service complies with the set of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFCs, ensuring it is an open and standardized protocol.

2. **Interoperability:**
   - The service is RFC-compliant and uses standard DNS data file and resource record formats, allowing it to work with most other DNS server implementations, such as those using Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software.

3. **Active Directory Support:**
   - DNS is required to support Active Directory. When a server is made an Active Directory domain controller, the DNS Server service can be automatically installed and configured on that server.

4. **Enhancements to DNS Zone Storage in Active Directory:**
   - DNS zones can be stored in the domain or application directory partitions of Active Directory. You can specify the partition in which to store the zone, and the zone's data is replicated among the specified domain controllers.

5. **Conditional Forwarding:**
   - The DNS Server service extends standard forwarder support with conditional forwarding, allowing DNS servers to forward queries based on the DNS domain name in the query.

6. **Stub Zones:**
   - Stub zones are copies of zones that contain only the resource records required to identify the authoritative DNS servers for that zone. A DNS server hosting a parent zone and a stub zone for one of the parent zone's delegated child zones can receive updates from the authoritative DNS servers for the child zone.

7. **Integration with Other Microsoft Networking Services:**
   - The DNS Server service integrates with other services such as Active Directory, WINS, and DHCP, offering features beyond those specified in the DNS RFCs.

8. **Ease of Administration:**
   - The DNS snap-in provides a graphical user interface for managing the DNS Server service, and several configuration wizards simplify common administrative tasks. The Dnscmd command-line tool can also be used for most tasks, including scripting and remote administration.

9. **RFC-Compliant Support for DNS Dynamic Update:**
   - The DNS Server service allows clients to dynamically update address and pointer resource records based on the DNS dynamic update protocol defined in RFC 2136, eliminating the need for manual management of DNS records.

10. **Secure Dynamic Updates:**
    - Zones integrated with Active Directory can be configured for secure dynamic updates, allowing only authorized computers to make changes to resource records.

11. **Incremental Zone Transfer:**
    - The DNS Server service uses incremental zone transfers to replicate only the changed portions of a zone, conserving network bandwidth.

12. **Support for New Resource Record Types:**
    - The service includes support for several new resource record types, such as SRV and ATMA, expanding the use of DNS as a name database service.

13. **Aging and Scavenging:**
    - The DNS service can age and scavenge records, removing stale records from DNS when enabled.

### Additional Features in Windows Server 2008

- **Background Zone Loading:**
- **Enhancements to Support IPv6:**
- **Support for Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs):**
- **Ability to Host Global Single-Label Names:**

### Installing the DNS Server Service

You can install the DNS Server service in Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 in the following ways:

1. **Windows Component Installation:**
   - Use the Add or Remove Programs item in Control Panel (Windows Server 2003).
   - Use the Manage Your Server Wizard (Windows Server 2003).
   - Use the Server Manager snap-in (Windows Server 2008).

2. **Active Directory Installation Wizard:**
   - Use Dcpromo.exe.

### Configuring the DNS Server Service

The configuration of the DNS Server service includes properties for the DNS server and forward and reverse lookup zone files. You can modify the properties of a DNS server using the DNS snap-in.

- **Interfaces Tab:**
  - Specify the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses on which the DNS Server service listens for incoming DNS messages.
  
- **Forwarders Tab:**
  - Configure the forwarding behavior, including conditional forwarding, IP addresses for forwarding, timeout behavior, and recursive query options.
  
- **Advanced Tab:**
  - Enable various options such as round-robin, subnet prioritization, data format for checking names, zone data location (Active Directory or local files), and scavenging settings.
  
- **Root Hints Tab:**
  - Configure the set of root domain servers used during iterative queries. Changes are updated in the Cache.dns file.
  
- **Debug Logging Tab:**
  - Enable and configure options for the DNS debug log file, which is useful for troubleshooting.
  
- **Event Logging Tab:**
  - Specify the level of logging for information stored in the DNS event log.
  
- **Monitoring Tab:**
  - Perform diagnostic functions to ensure the correct configuration and operation of the DNS server.
  
- **Security Tab:**
  - Specify access control lists (ACLs) for DNS server administration.

### Maintaining Zones

You can use the DNS snap-in to administer two main types of zones:

- **Forward Lookup Zones:**
- **Reverse Lookup Zones:**
