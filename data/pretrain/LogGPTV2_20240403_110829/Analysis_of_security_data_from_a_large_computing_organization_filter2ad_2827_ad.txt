**Table III: Incident Types and Counts**
- **Application Compromise (22):** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in applications such as VNC, MySQL, MSSQL, and OpenSSL.
- **Credential Compromise (32):** Gaining access using stolen passwords/key-pairs.

### Observations
- **Authentication Mechanisms (55%):**
  - Brute Force SSH: 19 incidents
  - Credential Compromise: 32 incidents
  - Application Compromises: 10 incidents (VNC null session: 6, vulnerabilities in telnet, rlogin, Open X11: 4, Web server/application: 7 due to misconfiguration).

  - Misconfigurations: 7
  - Web-Application Vulnerabilities: 10
  - Backdoors: 3
  - Scanning Other Hosts: 5

- **Unauthorized Media (10):**
  - Sophisticated attackers installing rootkits and hiding media using alternate data streams.

- **Unknown Entry Points (20, 16%):**
  - Application Compromises, Spam/Phishing, and Infected Systems.

### Alert Categories and Incident Types
- **Alerts Detect Multiple Incident Types:**
  - Example: Credential stealing incident vs. application compromise incident, both detected by anomalous HTTP requests with "wget" as the user-agent.

### Attack Phases
- **Scan Phase:**
  - Identifying vulnerable hosts and gathering information.
- **Breach Phase:**
  - Gaining access using stolen or guessed credentials or exploiting misconfigurations.
- **Penetration Control:**
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
- **Embedding:**
  - Setting up the compromised host for remote commands and reusable access.
- **Data Extraction/Modification:**
  - Hiding malware and tracks, modifying system data.
- **Attack-Relay/Misuse:**
  - Misusing the system for personal gain (e.g., spam, DDoS, password harvesting, distributing warez, spreading viruses, and phishing).

### Incident Count by Phase
- **Scan Phase:**
  - 1/1
- **Breach Phase:**
  - 30/39
- **Penetration Control:**
  - 9/10
- **Embedding:**
  - 21/23
- **Data Extraction/Modification:**
  - 8/9
- **Attack-Relay/Misuse:**
  - 7/7
  - 48/61

### Conclusion
- **Detection Mechanisms:**
  - Anomaly-based detectors caught 87% of incidents, while signature-based alerts detected only 13%.
  - Early detection is crucial, and current monitoring tools need to adapt to changing attacker behaviors.

This structured and detailed analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the various incident types, their causes, and the effectiveness of different detection mechanisms.
