### Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Approaches in Network Tomography

Very little of the existing literature on network tomography has explored MCMC methods. The only MCMC approach that has been tested is Gibbs sampling, as seen in [14, 29], which is a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Both studies [14, 29] applied an additional condition of sparsity, meaning that network measurements should be explained by significant losses at a few points rather than small, widespread losses. These studies focused primarily on tree structures, where sparsity can help by concentrating loss higher in the tree, aiding in diagnosis. However, in our context, sparsity is not always applicable (e.g., in AS origin validation), and we measure across general graphs, not just trees. It is worth noting that piecing together trees would be a non-trivial task, making a direct comparison with prior work out of scope.

### Binary Network Tomography

Binary (or Boolean) Network Tomography aims to classify links as "good" or "bad," which is a simpler and more practical inference in some cases [2, 3, 14, 28, 29]. More recently, binary tomography has been applied to general networks to identify censoring ASs by formulating the problem using logical constraints as SAT [10]. This approach leverages the extensive body of work on solving SAT problems but faces challenges: it can have multiple solutions, requiring a method to choose one, or it can have no solutions in the presence of measurement noise. Our approach seeks a middle ground between earlier probabilistic methods, which come with many assumptions and limitations, and the more practical binary tomography. We aim to determine if an AS has a particular property, while also allowing for partial properties and providing a measure of uncertainty. Binary tomography, by itself, does not typically allow such flexibility.

### Limitations of Binary Approaches

We did not compare our method to binary approaches because they cannot derive meaningful results in scenarios of inconsistent deployment. For example, SAT would lead to zero valid solutions based on our data. AS 701 is a concrete example in the current Internet, which damps routes on some paths and not on others (see § 5.1).

### Practical Network Tomography

Despite some limitations, practical network tomography systems have been built [20, 39], demonstrating that methods like ours can be scaled to create useful systems for entire networks.

### Heuristic Approaches

Several studies have used heuristics to pinpoint routing changes [7, 18]. These are tangentially related to our work. A closer example is a prototype [9] that attempts to find the reason for a missing route but does not investigate the exact reasons for unreachability. Another relevant study [27] considers the general problem of inferring AS properties, but most such studies assume an atomic model of ASs, i.e., each AS has a deterministic behavior. A key difference in our work is that we perform controlled experiments using Beacons rather than relying on natural churn.

### Recent Studies on RPKI Deployment

Recent studies have focused on locating ASs that deploy route filtering based on RPKI. Gilad et al. [21] locate route divergences between invalid and valid prefix announcements to infer RPKI deployment. Testart et al. [41] presented another heuristic, assuming that vantage points with full feeds export fewer invalid announcements if they deploy filtering. Both approaches are prone to false positives due to traffic engineering and incorrectly configured RPKI data. Reuter et al. [32] introduced controlled, active experiments to precisely pinpoint ASs that deploy RPKI filtering, but this requires a strict measurement setup, including direct peering between the experiment AS and vantage point.

### Conclusion and Outlook

We presented BeCAUSe, an algorithmic framework for inferring network properties. Unlike heuristic methods, BeCAUSe does not restrict topology setup or require specific participation from network elements, except for their usual packet forwarding. The framework uses two Bayesian computation techniques for rigorous network tomography. We demonstrated BeCAUSe's ability to pinpoint autonomous systems that deploy route flap damping and route origin validation. To our knowledge, this is the first global-scale measurement of route flap damping, revealing that at least 9% of measured ASs use RFD, with ≈ 60% relying on deprecated, harmful vendor default configurations. BeCAUSe outperforms different heuristics in precision and recall and is designed as a generic framework, not just for a specific use case. Future applications may include tracking censorship or other similar topics.

### Ethics

When performing active BGP measurements, it is crucial to avoid impacting real-world operations. During our measurements, we ensured that our Beacons did not overwhelm other routers. In the first measurement period, our Beacons caused 0.48% of all IPv4 control plane traffic, and in the second period, 0.54%. Even with high update burst rates, our Beacon prefixes caused significantly fewer updates than other prefixes on the Internet.
