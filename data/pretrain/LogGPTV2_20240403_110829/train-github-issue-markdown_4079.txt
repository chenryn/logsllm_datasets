I'm currently updating the new React DevTools to use suspense for more
interactions (bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental#196). This has uncovered
three pain points that we should try to address:
  1. ~~**Using the "two`setState` pattern" can be awkward** if the priority is "normal" or higher (as was the case in my "keydown" event handler) because `scheduler.next` uses "normal" priority for this case. (This also applies to e.g. non-React event handlers, since the default priority for these is "normal" as well.) **Temporary workaround** \- manually run the first update with user-blocking priority.~~
  2. ~~**Offscreen updates** cause user-blocking and normal priority work to be batched together (for unknown reasons). This makes interactions feel unresponsive. **Temporary workaround** \- none (other than to stop using offscreen priority).~~
  3. **Fallback UI shown too quickly**. One of the main reasons to use suspense in the "inspected element" panel to begin with is to avoid a quick flash of the "Loading..." fallback when a new element is selected. However, it seems like this is still happening even with suspense. **Temporary workaround** \- none, since I don't know the cause.
**Edit** I think the first two items I reported were caused by a
second/duplicate scheduler package that had gotten installed in DevTools as a
transient dependency.
