They said you may be able to help.  

I am brand new to subversion and have been told that this is the best thing since sliced bread. I have tried google and I am just drawing blanks on what is wrong and have tried multiple different suggestions. I get the following error

The Location information has been specified incorrectly.

svn: Propfind of '/svn': 405 Method not allowed (http://IPADDRESS) with IPADDRESS being the IP of my server.

I get this when I try to log in through Zend Studio. I use the following to try to login url http://IPADDRESS/svn/ username: fakeuser password: fakepassword

I believe that the issue is around this file because of the error "Location Information has been specified incorrectly". This file is included in the httpd.conf file. I have restarted apache and there are not errors when restarting apache.

&lt;Location /project1&gt;
   DAV svn
   SVNPath /home/jhughes/project1
   AuthzSVNAccessFile /home/jhughes/.svn-policy-file
   AuthName "SVN Repositories"
   AuthType Basic
   AuthUserFile /home/jhughes/.svn-auth-file
   Satisfy Any
   Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;


I have spent a few hours on this and cannot get it. So any help is appreciated and I will for sure give someone the point.

I am not using a proxy server. I am using the IP address of the server because I have multiple domains on the server and thought this may be an issue.

Assistant: Ops, maybe I have lost something, but if your Location is "/project1" why access http://IPADDRESS/svn/?

I just paste your Location conf snippet here (ubuntu karmic), create the repo and user and authz files and everything worked here under "http://IPADDRESS/project1"

Your .svn-auth-file hasnt errors?

Through ordinary browsers it works?

Something happens on apache logs?
