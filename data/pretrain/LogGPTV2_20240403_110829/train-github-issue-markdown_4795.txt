**Playwright Setup - Jenkins**
A Jenkinsfile is used, with this stage to run the tests inside a docker
container and not the Jenkins host.
    stage('Running Tests') {
                agent {
                    docker {
                        image “url to docker image”  (dockerfile to generate is attached)                                                        
                        registryUrl “docker registry url”
                        registryCredentialsId XXXXXXXXXXX
                        args "-u root --shm-size=4gb -v $WORKSPACE/$tests_Dir:/tmp/tests"
                        reuseNode true
                    }
                }
                steps {
                    script {
                        String testsDir = "/tmp/tests"
                        RunBrowserTests(friendlyAppName, Target_URL, Test_Specs_GLOB, NPM_Script, testsDir, "", Target_Environment, Secret_Data_Path, Technology_Stack, "", "", Extra_Switches, "", "$WORKSPACE", CheckBooleanParam(Use_Script), Script_Config)
                    }
                }
            }
RunBrowserTests does the following….
Runs the bash script here : https://bitbucket.org/eurotaxglass1/av-
automatron/src/master/runtests.sh  
E.g : bash /tmp/tests/runtests.sh staging Regression true true
**Steps**  
Run the tests over Jenkins repeatedly.
**Expected**  
Tests are initiated concurrently, one param "de" runs with a project and grep
of "de" and the other param "uk" runs with project and grep "uk", each run
produces its own report, one in the "DE" and one in the "UK" folder of the
playwright-report folder.
**Actual**  
If running these tests on repeat, there will eventually within 10-20 runs be
an error on Jenkins CI containing the Pirates dependency description, and when
that occurs one of the concurrent runs will not execute or produce results,
while the other concurrent run will. This happens with production code a lot
more (every 2-4 runs) than with the boilerplate obscured code I have provided
in the issue.
