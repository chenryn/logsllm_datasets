User: How to set resource limits and requests for pods when deploying services using Kubernetes?
Assistant: In Kubernetes, you can ensure that containers get enough resources when they need them by setting resource limits and requests in Pods. These settings can be configured in the Pod's yaml file using the following fields: spec: containers: - name: example-container image: example/image resources: limits: cpu: "1" memory: "1Gi" requests: cpu: "500m " memory: "500Mi" In this example, we set CPU and memory resource limits and requests for the container. The units of limit and request are the number of CPUs ("1") and memory size ("1Gi" or "500Mi "), where "Gi" means gigabytes and "Mi" means megabytes. In this example, the container requested 500M CPU and 500Mi memory, and set a limit of 1 CPU and 1Gi memory at the same time, which means that when the container needs more resources, Kubernetes will automatically adjust the quota of the container. By setting resource limits and requests, you can ensure the reliability and scalability of Pods in using resources without affecting the availability and performance of other Pods.
