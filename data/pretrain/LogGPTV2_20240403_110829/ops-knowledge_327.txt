User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题ASA 5505, is BGP supported? I need to configure BGP on an ASA 5505, according to certain sources it isn't supported, yet I can find resources on the internet giving information on how to configure BGP. 

I'd really like an expert to answer some queries for me. 


Can you configure BGP on the ASA 5505?

1b. if you can't, what can you use in its place?

Assistant: ASA doesn't support BGP whatever the model.
This information is in the documentation, see http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa80/configuration/guide/glossary.html#wp1027964



Update

BGP is supported on ASA from v9.2 (release notes).

Configuration examples are available. The keywords are similar to IOS.
