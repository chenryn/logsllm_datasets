**Syntax:**
```plaintext
set verbose {on | off}
```

**Parameters:**

- **on:**

    - Writer inclusion or exclusion.
    - Metadata compression and extraction.

- **off:**
  - Disables verbose output logging during the shadow copy creation process.

**Example Usage:**
```plaintext
set verbose on
```
This will enable verbose output, providing detailed logs during the shadow copy creation.

```plaintext
