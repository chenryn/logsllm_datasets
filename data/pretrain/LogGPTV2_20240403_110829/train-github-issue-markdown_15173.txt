At the moment the Routing component only supports absolute and domain-relative
URLs, e.g.  
`http://example.org/user-slug/article-slug/comments` and  
`/user-slug/article-slug/comments`.
But I find it very useful to specify path-relative URLs that depend on the
current request path. Lets say the client requests `http://example.org/user-
slug/article-slug/` and I want to generate a link to the comments of the same
article.  
Currently the resulting link would again duplicate the `user-slug` and
`article-slug` -> `/user-slug/article-slug/comments`.  
But it could be simplified to `comments` or `./comments`.
One additional feature that could be implemented is a new twig function
(besides `url` and `path`) lets call it `subpath`.  
It fetches the variables of the current request, e.g. `user-slug` and
`article-slug` internally and then generates such a relative URL. The
advantage is you don't need to specify the variables of the current request
again.  
So simply `{{ subpath('article_comments') }}` is enough for the URL
`./comments`. But you can optionally overwrite some request variables with `{{
subpath('article_comments', {'article': 'different-article-slug'} ) }}` which
would generate `../different-article-slug/comments` (i.e. same user, but
different article).
Thinking of it, the twig function is also a quite useful without the path-
relative URLs. So these are basically two feature requests.  
I already got an idea how to implement this but would like to get your
feedback whether one of these features is also useful to others.
