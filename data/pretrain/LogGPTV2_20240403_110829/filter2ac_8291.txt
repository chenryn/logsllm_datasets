### Title: BotConf 2020 - Hunting the Quasar Family: How to Track a Malware Family

**Abstract:**

QuasarRAT is one of the most well-known open-source Remote Access Trojans (RATs) available. Since the release of xRAT, the predecessor to QuasarRAT, in 2014, it has been widely adopted by attackers in numerous campaigns. The open-source nature of this tool allows attackers to conduct operations in a generic manner, making attribution more challenging. This trend has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, with open-source tools like QuasarRAT being utilized in a variety of cyberattacks.

Our investigation has uncovered multiple RAT projects that are related to or derived from QuasarRAT. These projects often involve enhancing QuasarRAT with new functionalities or transforming it into entirely new types of malware. The Quasar family of malware has been implicated in a significant number of attack cases. Understanding the details of QuasarRAT and its variants, including how each project evolves from the original QuasarRAT and how they are employed in new attack scenarios, is crucial for effective threat detection and mitigation.
