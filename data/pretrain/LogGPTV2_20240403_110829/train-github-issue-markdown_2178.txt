_What steps should we try in your demo to see the problem?_
  1. put some input longer than 2 characters in the first input
  2. try to put some input longer than 2 characters in the second input
**Current behavior**
HTML5 specifies a number of validation attributes for form elements that
browsers are able to interpret to various effects. These are useful for things
like restricting input length (maxLength) and for doing DOM queries (e.g. find
all required input elements).
Currently, Angular2 applies validation for a number of these attributes if
they are applied in the form template. However, when forms are built using
FormBuilder, validation is defined in the ControlMeta object and not as
attributes on the form elements. ngControl does not apply these validations as
attributes to the host element, so when FormBuilder is used, either these
attributes will not get defined and therefore the browser's HTML5 validation
behavior will not be in effect or validation constraints must be duplicated in
the form templates and ControlMeta.
**Expected/desired behavior**
I think it would be useful to have the ngControl directive manage HTML5
validation attributes on the host form element based on the validators applied
to the Control object.
