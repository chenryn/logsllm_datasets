such separation would improve the readability and utility of the
label and help educate consumers. P1 explained: “I lean toward
the option of separation, because I’d like to see a streamlined
label for most consumers to ‘consume’ as easily and quickly
as possible.” S8 concurred: “Consumers may have preferences
for one aspect more than the other and stating them separately
better enables consumer choice and education.” However, the
other half of the experts believed privacy and security factors
should be combined into one section (11/21). For example,
P4 believed that for some consumers, security seems more
important than privacy. Thus, separating them on the label may
cause consumers to focus only on security factors and ignore
privacy information. Among those experts, who were more
interested in combining privacy and security information into
one section, almost all of them (9/11) mentioned that privacy
and security are so related that it is not possible to completely
separate these two concepts.
In the label that we presented to consumer interview partici-
pants, we grouped information into three main sections: security
mechanisms, data practices, and general/more information.
Participants preferred the proposed separation of sections and
reported that these groupings made sense to them.
B. Factors to Include in the IoT Label
From the second survey, we found 30 factors that at least 4
out of 7 of the experts recommended including on the label
(either on the primary or secondary layer) and 17 factors that
at least 4 out of 7 experts recommended excluding from the
label. Note that since only a third of the factors were shown to
each expert (total 21 on the second survey), at least 4 responses
constituted a majority.
The authors discussed the experts’ arguments and preferences
for each factor and made a decision as to whether or not each
factor should be included and if so, on which layer of the
label. In some cases, we made a decision that contradicted the
majority of experts if we felt that their arguments could be
accommodated in a different way.
1) Primary Layer: We found 12 factors that at least 4 out
assessment organization
assessment organization
of 7 experts wanted to include on the primary layer:
• Privacy rating for the device from an independent privacy
• Security rating for the device from an independent security
• The date until which security updates will be provided
• Type of data that is being collected
• Type of sensor(s) on the device
• Whether or not the device is getting cryptographically signed
• Types of physical actuations (e.g., talking, blinking) the
device has and in what circumstances they are activated
• Whether or not the device is using any default password
and critical automatic security updates
• Frequency of data sharing (e.g., continuous, on demand)
• The warranty period of the device
• Level of detail (granularity) of the data being collected, used,
• Access control for device and apps (e.g., none, single-user
and shared (e.g., identiﬁable, aggregate)
account, multi-user account)
Experts were interested in including these factors on the
primary layer because they considered them necessary for
consumers to know, they convey critical information about the
privacy and security of the device, and they inform consumers’
purchase decisions. For example, P1 explained why the type
of collected data should be included on the primary layer: “I
think this is the most useful information to be provided to
consumers for them to compare privacy risks of IoT devices.”
All of our consumer participants understood the information
presented on the primary layer and were able to talk about
privacy and security implications of each factor. For example,
consumers associated the expiration date of the device to its
security updates lifetime. C3 mentioned “planned obsolescence”
when talking about the security update lifetime: “I do like the
fact that you say when the security updates will no longer be
available, because that alerts people to the fact that this device
is going to expire. People have thermostats that last for decades
and it’s useful to know that this is planned obsolescence.” One
of our participants brought up a point of skepticism, related
to how long a company claims to provide security updates:
“I’m skeptical because I know that tech startups can very rarely
guarantee that their servers will be online for three or more
years.”
Among the factors experts believed should be included on
the primary layer, there were three factors that we decided to
either move to the secondary layer or exclude from the label.
Note that we also removed privacy and security star ratings
later in the process as mentioned in Section V. We expect to
add them back when such assessments are available in the
future.
First, we decided to move the physical actuation factor to
the secondary layer because this information is not usually
directly related to the privacy and security of the device. In the
consumer study, all participants found this information useful
from a safety point of view, but none wanted us to move this
factor to the primary layer as they reported that the information
conveyed by this factor does not have privacy and security
implications for them.
Second, we decided to move frequency of data sharing to
the secondary layer because prior work has shown that most
people do not understand the privacy and security implications
of the frequency of data sharing [9]. While almost all the
consumers we interviewed were concerned about data sharing,
only four mentioned privacy concerns related to the frequency
of sharing.
Third, we decided to exclude device warranty period from
the label because it has few, if any, privacy, security, or safety
implications.

2) Secondary Layer: We found 13 factors that at least 4
out of 7 experts wanted to include on the secondary layer of
the label:
• Retention time
• Purpose of data collection
• What information can be inferred from the collected data
• Supported standards (e.g., Wi-Fi, Zigbee)
• Where the collected data is stored
• Whether or not the collected data will be linked with data
• Special data handling practices for children’s data
• The control that users are offered (e.g., opt-in/out from data
• Data-collection frequency (e.g., once a month, on install)
• Whether or not the device can still function when Internet
• Relevant security and privacy laws and standards to which
the device complies (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR)
• Link to the device’s key management protocol
• Resource usage in terms of power and data (e.g., kw, kbps)
Experts mentioned two common reasons to include a factor
in the secondary layer rather than the primary layer: the factor
requires detailed information to convey risk to consumers
(mentioned by 6/7) or the factor does not convey critical
information related to the privacy and security of the device
(mentioned by 4/7).
connectivity is turned off
Among the factors our experts wanted to include on the
secondary layer, there were three factors that we decided to
include on the primary layer instead: date of the latest ﬁrmware
update, purpose of data collection, and where the collected
data is stored.
Experts wanted to have the date of ﬁrmware update on the
secondary layer mainly because these updates happen frequently
and the information on the label can become outdated. On
the other hand, consumers need to know the ﬁrmware version
to which the label is applicable. Therefore, we believe the
ﬁrmware version number and date information should be
provided on both layers of the label.
Most experts (6/7) believed that it would be hard to ﬁt all
the purposes of data collection on the primary layer of the
label. Therefore, they recommended including this information
on the secondary layer. However, past research has shown
that purpose of data collection is one of the most important
factors consumers want to consider when making privacy
decisions [12], [59], [61]. Purposes may be grouped into high-
level categories that could be included on the primary layer.
For example, the W3C’s Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P)
standard identiﬁed 12 purpose categories [105]. The consumers
we interviewed indicated that it was important to them to know
the type of data collected and the purpose of collection when
making device purchase decisions.
Experts stated that where the data is stored should be
included on the secondary layer because it is not relevant to
privacy or security. However, we believe local storage versus
data being stored on the cloud can indeed have different privacy
and security implications [85]. Therefore, we decided to include
program
this in the primary layer. Moreover, most consumer participants
were able to reason about privacy and security implications of
cloud versus device and discuss the trade-off between security
and convenience. C10 talked about this trade-off by saying:
The advantage of the cloud is that if the device is
damaged, you can still access it. So it’s going to be
always available as long as you can access internet.
The other issue with the cloud though is that, like,
it can be hacked and also, who has access to that
is less clear, or you have less control over that. But
I can always access it from whatever device I have
and it’s convenient.
Although experts recommended including information about
device resource usage on the secondary layer, we decided to
remove this factor from the label due to its lack of privacy,
security, or safety implications.
3) Factors with no Speciﬁc Layer: There were four remain-
ing factors that at least 4 out of 7 experts were enthusiastic
about having on the label, but their opinions were split between
including them on either the primary or the secondary layer.
These factors were:
• Who the data is shared with
• Who the data is sold to
• Whether or not the device can still function when data-driven
smart features (e.g., the learning function of smart thermostat)
are turned off
• Whether or not the device has parental control mode
For these factors, about half of the experts reported that
they would like to include them on the primary layer since
they are important privacy and security factors that consumers
should know about before making purchase decisions. The
other half of the experts were not enthusiastic about including
these factors on the primary layer.
We decided to put the factors related to parental controls
and device functionality when smart features are turned off on
the secondary layer because they are not directly related to
security or privacy.
Some experts (3/7) noted that who data is shared with or sold
to is likely to change over time, and recommended putting these
factors on the secondary layer where they could be updated
more easily. We showed consumers a label with these factors
on the secondary layer. However, all consumer participants
expressed concern when they saw that their information could
be shared and sold with third parties and 8 out of 15 said who
data is sold to or shared with were among the most important
factors that could inform their purchase decisions. Therefore
we moved these factors back to the primary layer.
4) Factors to Exclude from the Label: There were six factors
that at least 6 out of 7 experts believed should not be included
on the label:
• List of device-compatible products
• Link to the device’s software and hardware bill of material
• Link to the device’s accompanying app(s)
• Whether or not the device manufacturer has a bug bounty
• Where and when the device brand was incorporated
• Consumer Reports rating
The most common reasons experts said these factors were
not suitable for the label were the lack of relevance to privacy
and security and inability to convey risk to consumers. For
example, S2 did not want the label to include whether or
not the manufacturer has a bug bounty program as this factor
does not offer adequate insight into security practices of the
company: “This information is not too important on how the
company does security analysis.”
Almost all experts were opposed to including the Consumer
Reports rating, mainly as they believed this organization’s
reputation does not stem from their privacy and security
assessments. However, Consumer Reports is in the process
of developing a digital privacy and security standard [22], so
this may change in the future.
We decided to include whether or not the device manu-
facturer has a bug bounty program on the secondary layer.
Since the word “bug bounty” was not immediately clear to
consumer participants, we changed the wording to vulnerability
disclosure and management, which was more understandable
to them. When we presented this factor to our participants,
13 out of 15 associated this information with having good
privacy and security practices, hence they were more inclined
to trust the company who were transparent about their devices’
discovered vulnerabilities and had taken steps to manage them.
C3 explained: “This factor shows that this is a company that
has a security process, and participates in public activities
to educate the community on things that can go wrong.” C5
wanted the IoT companies to disclose their devices’ history
of known vulnerabilities: “A lot of times, if the company had
some kind of vulnerability, they maybe want to sweep it under
the rug and not let anyone know about it. That’s good that it
shows you that they’re being honest about what issues they’ve
had in the past, and what they’ve done to address them.”
We decided to include a link to the software and hardware bill
of materials (mentioned on the label as software and hardware
composition list) on the secondary layer since it can provide
useful information related to security when it is available. When
we asked consumers about this factor, most wanted it to be
included and noted that even if they did not understand it, it
could be useful to those with technical expertise.
Based on our experts’ opinions, we initially excluded the list
of device-compatible products from the label. In the consumer
interview study, we asked participants to tell us about anything
they thought was missing from the label that they would like
us to add. The only factor that participants suggested was a
link to the privacy statement of device-compatible products
such as Alexa. As this was suggested by a couple of our early
participants, we added a factor on the secondary layer to list
compatible platforms with a link to their privacy policies.
C. Attitudes toward Labels and Layered Design
All consumer participants discussed how difﬁcult it is for
them currently to ﬁnd information related to privacy and
security of smart devices before purchasing them. They all
reported that they would like to have an IoT security and
privacy label available at the point of sale, mainly to be as
informed as possible.
Most experts mentioned that IoT privacy and security
labels are useful to inform consumers when making purchase
decisions, which is in line with prior work [37]. P7 explained
that a label can provide consumers with information they would
not have otherwise:
What’s good about a label is that it empowers the
consumer to make a more active decision about cyber-
security rather than just being completely helpless as
to what the security of her device might be. Especially
as more and more of this technology is designed for
consumers, the average consumer doesn’t have a
privacy, security, or a legal department to review
