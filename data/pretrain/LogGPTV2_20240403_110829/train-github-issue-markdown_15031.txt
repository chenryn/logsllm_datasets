# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I spend more time on my work computer than on my personal computer. Corporate
has locked down the installation of applications to approved applications
only. Local administrators can run unapproved portable applications.
FancyZones in particular would be very usefull on my work laptop where I must
have multiple windows open at all times.
It would be great if this app could be made portable. If not the entire
settings and all apps, perhaps some of the individual apps, like FancyZone,
could be.
