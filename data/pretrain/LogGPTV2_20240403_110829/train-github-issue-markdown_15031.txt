### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

I spend more time on my work computer than on my personal one. The corporate IT policy restricts the installation of applications to a pre-approved list, with only local administrators having the ability to run unapproved portable applications. In my work environment, I frequently need to have multiple windows open simultaneously, and a tool like FancyZones would be extremely useful for managing these windows efficiently.

It would be highly beneficial if FancyZones, or at least some of its core functionalities, could be made available as a portable application. This would allow users like me, who are restricted by corporate policies, to take advantage of this productivity-enhancing tool without requiring administrative privileges.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

1. **Portable Version of FancyZones:**
   - Develop a standalone, self-contained version of FancyZones that does not require installation.
   - Ensure that the portable version can be run from a USB drive or any other external storage device.
   - Include all necessary dependencies within the portable package to avoid any installation requirements.

2. **Modular Components:**
   - If creating a fully portable version of the entire suite is not feasible, consider making individual components, such as FancyZones, available as portable apps.
   - Provide clear instructions for users on how to download and use the portable version.

3. **Configuration and Settings:**
   - Allow the portable version to store user settings in a designated folder on the external storage device.
   - Ensure that the portable version can seamlessly load and save configurations, providing a consistent user experience across different machines.

4. **Compatibility and Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test the portable version on various operating systems and environments to ensure compatibility and stability.
   - Address any security concerns to ensure that the portable version adheres to corporate security standards.

By implementing these changes, users in restricted environments will be able to benefit from the powerful window management capabilities of FancyZones, enhancing their productivity and efficiency.
