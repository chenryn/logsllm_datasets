User: since it is not possible to access mysql remotely on GAE, without the google cloud sql, 
could I put a sqlite3 file on google cloud storage and access it through the GAE with django.db.backends.sqlite3?
Thanks.
Assistant: Google Cloud SQL is meant for this, why don't you want to use it?
If you have every frontend instance load the DB file, you'll have a really hard time synchronizing them.  It just doesn't make sense.  Why would you want to do this?
