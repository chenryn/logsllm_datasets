User: Please design a high availability load balancing solution to meet the following requirements. An e-commerce website needs to process tens of thousands of user requests per second. In order to ensure the accessibility and performance of the website, a high-availability load balancing solution needs to be designed. At the same time, in order to improve the user's access speed and experience, it is necessary to cache the static resources of the website (such as pictures, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and distribute them through CDN.
Assistant: 1. Server cluster: use the server cluster solution to distribute requests to multiple servers in a balanced manner for processing. When one of the servers fails, the load balancer can dynamically distribute requests to other normal servers, thus ensuring the accessibility of the website. At the same time, high-performance hardware equipment is used to ensure the performance of the server. 2. CDN acceleration: Use CDN service to cache static resources of the website, such as images, CSS, JavaScript, etc. The CDN distribution network is spread all over the world, which can provide users with fast resource access speed. The cache server adopts a multi-level architecture, which can cache and distribute resources more efficiently and improve the user's access speed and experience. 3. Database cluster: Use the database cluster solution to allocate database instances to multiple nodes to achieve read-write separation and load balancing. When one of the database servers fails, the system automatically switches to other normal database nodes to ensure high availability and stability of the database. 4. Backup and disaster recovery plan: regularly back up all important data and store them in reliable storage devices. At the same time, formulate a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, such as multi-room disaster recovery, remote backup, etc., to ensure the safety and reliability of website data. 5. Monitoring and operation and maintenance: Use efficient monitoring tools to monitor servers, networks and applications in real time to achieve rapid response and troubleshooting. And establish a sound operation and maintenance system to ensure the stability and high availability of the system through continuous operation and maintenance measures.
