User: I am a Plone newbie and am trying to install Plone 4.0.5 on Ubuntu 11.04 Natty using the Unified Installer.
I unpack the installer and run the ./install.sh zeo as root and I get the following error:

ZEO Cluster Install selected

Detailed installation log being written to /tmp/Plone-4.0.5-UnifiedInstaller/install.log

Root install method chosen. Will install for use by system user plone

Installing Plone 4.0.5 at /usr/local/Plone

User 'plone' already exists. No need to create it.

Python zlib support is missing; something went wrong in the zlib or python build.

Installation has failed.
See the detailed installation log at /tmp/Plone-4.0.5-UnifiedInstaller/install.log
to determine the cause.

I have installed these ubuntu packages too:

apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev zlibc libghc6-zlib-dev zlibc

The install.log is quite big - I'm just including mentions of zlib here:

To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.


Failed to build these modules:

I can't find a setup.py in the installation files.
Any ideas what I should do or what I should be looking for? 
Thank you.
Assistant: Instructing the Unified Installer to build its own zlib works: ./install.sh --libz=yes zeo
