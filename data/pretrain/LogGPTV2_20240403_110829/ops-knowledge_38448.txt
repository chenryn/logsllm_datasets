Subject: Installation Issue with Plone 4.0.5 on Ubuntu 11.04 Using Unified Installer

Dear Support,

I am a beginner with Plone and am currently attempting to install Plone 4.0.5 on an Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) system using the Unified Installer. Upon unpacking the installer and running `./install.sh zeo` as the root user, I encountered the following error:

```
ZEO Cluster Install selected
Detailed installation log being written to /tmp/Plone-4.0.5-UnifiedInstaller/install.log
Root install method chosen. Will install for use by system user plone
Installing Plone 4.0.5 at /usr/local/Plone
User 'plone' already exists. No need to create it.
Skipping libjpeg build

Installing Python 2.6.6. This takes a while...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in 
LookupError: unknown encoding: zip
Python zlib support is missing; something went wrong in the zlib or python build.

Installation has failed.
See the detailed installation log at /tmp/Plone-4.0.5-UnifiedInstaller/install.log
to determine the cause.
```

To address this issue, I have also installed the following packages via `apt-get`:
```
apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev zlibc libghc6-zlib-dev zlibc
```

However, the problem persists. The relevant portion of the installation log, focusing on zlib, is as follows:

```
Starting at Tue May 17 14:12:46 SAST 2011
configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --with-readline, --with-zlib, --disable-tk, --with-cxx

Failed to find the necessary bits to build these modules:

sunaudiodev        zlib                               
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

Failed to build these modules:
crypt              nis          
...
```

Additionally, I could not locate a `setup.py` file within the installation files.

Could you provide guidance on what steps I should take next or what specific elements I should be looking for to resolve this issue?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**Resolution:**

After further investigation, I found that instructing the Unified Installer to build its own zlib resolves the issue. The correct command is:

```
./install.sh --libz=yes zeo
```

This approach successfully completes the installation process.
