B.1 Interaction Between Sapling and Sprout
Transactions
Another aspect of the adoption rate for Sapling transactions is how
many users have transferred their values from a Sprout shielded
address to a Sapling shielded address. To investigate this, we have
checked how many transaction outputs of a shielded Sprout trans-
action were spent directly as an input to a Sapling shielded trans-
action.
We have found 241 such outputs, hidden in 213 transactions
overall. Although this might not seem as a huge amount of trans-
actions, in the total value they cover more than 46K ZEC, which
is more than 20% of all Sapling hidden value not related to mining
rewards (212K ZEC) since the time of the Sapling hard fork.
Another question is whether these revealing transactions can be
tracked by the linking methods presented previously in Section 3.
The recommended method of coin transfer is described on the
Zcash website11, where the presence of this linkability is mentioned,
warning users and suggesting methods to avoid it by splitting the
values into smaller round denominations and moving them with
certain delays.
C FURTHER RESULTS
In Heuristic 1 we have used unique value matches. However even
in the case where a matching is not unique, the proposed methods
still provide a probabilistic linkability feature.

blockchain data.
B USAGE OF ZK-SNARKS
Let us investigate the usage and adoption rate of Sapling transac-
tions compared to Sprout transactions.
From Table 6, we notice that even though the number of trans-
actions decreased, the usage of shielded transactions from regular
users mostly switched to Sapling transactions and the main remain-
ing users of Sprout transactions are miners and mining pools who
did not change their use practices yet.

Table 8: Number of possible fingerprint pairs and how many
times they happen for a sliding window of 16,000 blocks. In
the last column we have removed the matches that were also
tagged as a unique complete match in Table 7 (the first line
of the table are the unique matches). The matches are not
reduced only from the unique matches (first line) because
even though a pair is a unique match, value match in the
chain does not mean it is a unique fingerprint match as well,
there can be more hiding and revealing transaction with the
same fingerprints, but with full values that are not the same.
Let us call the probability of a correct value match12 of the unique
input to the unique output going through the shielded pool by P.
Then to estimate the probability of correct non-unique matches we
can divide P by the number of possible pairings. If e.g. our baseline
best case is 85.3% probability (assuming 14.7% false positive rate),
with possible 3 hiding and 2 revealing values which are all identical,
3·2 ·0.853 = 0.142. Generalizing
the probability of correct linkage is 1
1|h|·|r | · P, where
this approach, the probability of correct linkage is
|h| and |r| is the number of times the exact value in question has
appeared as a hiding or a revealing value respectively.
This approach can be directly translated to fingerprints as well,
where a lower value of P might be applied as these links provide
less accuracy in general. Considering these metrics, Tables 7 and
Table 8 summarize the number of links registered based on the
possible number of pairs (|h| · |r|). Further exploration of probabilis-
tic matching together with anonymity set sizes derived from the
subset sums approach could be a direction for future research.
12The values a called matching when they differ by single fixed z-z hop fee.
D EXAMPLE OF A TAGGED TRANSACTION
In this section we show a test tagged transaction using the proposed
subliminal channels. The data is in the decoded hex Zcash transac-
tion in the JSON format. The transaction has two shielded inputs
and one shielded output. In the JSON listing the following features
contain the subliminal message. The first is the commitment value
cv which contains the subliminal message in the last byte as the
result of applying the Pedersen subliminal channel (Section 9). The
second is the zk-SNARK proof value proof, where the subliminal
message is embedded in the 48th and 144th byte using the Inner
Subliminal Channel (Section 8.2). For the ease of readability the
subliminal message is simply the zero value byte which we have
marked with bold font. The transaction can be verified on the Zcash
testnet using the hash of the transaction, which is the txid value.
