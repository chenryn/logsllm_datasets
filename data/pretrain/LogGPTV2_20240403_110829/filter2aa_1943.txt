- **Wages, salaries, and assets from unreported work related to legal services and goods**

### Tax Avoidance and Evasion
- **Tax avoidance (legal)**
- **Tax evasion (illegal)**

### Nonmonetary and Monetary Transactions
- **Nonmonetary transactions**
- **Monetary transactions**

### Illegal Activities
- **Barter of stolen goods and smuggling**
- **Production or growing of drugs for personal use**
- **Theft for personal use**
- **Trade in stolen goods, drug dealing, and manufacturing**
- **Prostitution, gambling, smuggling (international and inter-state), and fraud**
- **Counterfeiting**
- **Computer system hacking, trading stolen information, identity theft, and spamming**

## Measuring the Shadow Economy

- **Previous studies on measuring the size of the shadow economy** have primarily focused on the aggregate shadow economy, usually expressed as a percentage of the official economy.
- **Little to no work** has been done to estimate the size of specific sectors within the shadow economy in the context of the broader legal economy.

---

## Shadow Economy in the United States

- **Schneider and Enste (2000)** estimate the total U.S. shadow economy at between 8% and 10% of GDP, or approximately $1 to $1.4 trillion.
- **Evidence on specific sectors** is largely anecdotal and does not analyze how the shadow economy is linked to the official economy.

---

## International Comparisons

- **Estimates of the aggregate shadow economies** vary widely across different countries.
- **Examples:**
  - **Thailand, Nigeria, and Egypt:** 70% of GDP
  - **Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, and Peru:** 40% to 60% of GDP
  - **Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and South Korea:** 30% to 50% of GDP

- **Detailed breakdown:**
  - **Developing Countries:**
    - **Africa:** 68-76% (Nigeria, Egypt)
    - **Central and South America:** 40-60% (Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Panama)
    - **Asia:** 70% (Thailand), 38-50% (Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, South Korea)
  - **Transition Economies:**
    - **Central Europe:** 20-28% (Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland)
    - **Former Soviet Union Countries:** 28-43% (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Belarus)

## Why Shadow Economies Exist

- **Economic analysis by Becker (1968) and others** suggests that individuals engage in shadow economic activities for financial gain, weighing expected gains against costs and risks.
- **Key incentive areas:**
  - **Burden of taxes and social insurance contributions**
  - **Intensity of regulation**
  - **Social transfers**
  - **Labor market regulation**
  - **Public sector services**

---

## Incentive Issues

- **Burden of taxes and social insurance contributions:**
  - **Differences between the total cost of labor in the official economy and after-tax earnings** provide an incentive to sell labor in the shadow economy.
  - **Loayza (1997)** found that higher tax burdens and labor market restrictions increase the size of the shadow economy in 14 Latin American countries.

- **Intensity of regulation:**
  - **Increased regulation** reduces individual choices in the official economy.
  - **Shifting regulatory costs to employees** provides incentives for workers to supply labor to the shadow economy.

- **Social transfers:**
  - **The social welfare system** can increase the marginal tax rate, reducing incentives to work in the official economy.
  - **Disincentives for welfare recipients** to seek work in the official economy.

- **Labor market regulation:**
  - **Overregulation and high labor costs** in the official labor market drive the shadow economy (Schneider and Enste, 2000).
  - **Forced reductions in working hours** contrary to employee preferences increase potential hours available for the shadow economy.

- **Public sector services:**
  - **Decreased government revenues** due to the shadow economy can reduce the quality and quantity of public services.
  - **Higher taxes and lower-quality public goods** in the official sector can further incentivize participation in the shadow economy.
  - **Johnson, Kaufmann, and Zoido-Lobatón (1998)** show that smaller shadow economies are associated with higher tax revenues, lower tax rates, fewer regulations, and less bribery.

## Shadow-Official Economy Links

- **Previous work** linking the official and shadow economies has been macroeconomic.
- **Examples:**
  - **Houston (1987):** Developed a business cycle model including tax and monetary policy linkages.
  - **Adam and Ginsburg (1985):** Focused on the implications of the shadow economy on official growth.

---

## Focus on Information Sector

- **Shadow information sector** includes:
  - **Computer system hacking**
  - **Trading stolen information**
  - **Identity theft**
  - **Spamming**
  - **Other activities**

---

## Shadow Information Sector and Rest of Economy

- **Input-Output (IO) models** have long been used to examine inter-industry linkages and the effects of changes in final demand on specific industries.
- **A preliminary IO formulation** of the U.S. economy with an added shadow information sector is developed and presented.

## Simplified 3-Sector Official Economy

- **Consider a 3-sector economy** with manufacturing, services and other, and information sectors.
- **Aggregated for simplicity** based on 2002 U.S. economic statistics, expressed in billions of dollars.
- **Table shows** 2002 GDP of approximately $10.7 trillion.

## Simplified 4-Sector Economy with Shadow Information Sector

- **Consider two versions** of the economy with an additional shadow information sector accounting for either 1% or 3% of official information sector output.
- **Range of 1-3%** based on OECD (2002) estimates of the hacker economy in developed countries.
- **No changes** to other inter-industry transactions, though these would likely change with the overall reconstitution of economic activity.

### Discussion: 1-Percent Case

- **Hypothetical example** showing possible interactions between the official and shadow economies.
- **2002 GDP** increases by over 1% ($10.75 trillion) with the addition of the shadow information sector.
- **Example only includes** the shadow information sector; other shadow sectors could be added.
- **Does not account for** additional spending by firms to monitor and prevent hacking activity.
- **Such spending** would show up as higher expenditures by industries on output produced by the official information sector and possibly other sectors.

### Discussion: 3-Percent Case

- **2002 GDP** increases by over 3% ($11.01 trillion) with the addition of the shadow information sector.
- **Examples, though hypothetical**, provide insight into how adding a shadow information sector affects national income and product accounts using the IO framework.
- **Additional shadow components** of other industries, such as illegal drug manufacturing, would require additional shadow agricultural and manufacturing sectors.

---

## Employment in the Hacker Economy

- **US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):** 2007 employment in the entire information industry was slightly over 3 million, down from 3.4 million in 2002.
- **Estimate for 2002 shadow information industry employment:**
  - **1% figure:** 33,950 persons
  - **3% figure:** 101,850 persons
- **Caveats apply;** a bottom-up approach based on estimates of employment in each part of the shadow information sector might be more accurate.

---

## Summary and Conclusions

- **Complication in estimating the size of the hacker economy:** The sector is in a continual state of flux, changing with innovations in a highly innovative industry.
- **More detailed information** on hacker activities could be obtained with additional research and integrated into the broader economic framework.
- **Progress in this area** would allow for better measurement of the burden caused by various forms of hacking to the overall economy and individual industries.
- **Further analysis** could include applying the methodology to other countries and using those comparisons to adjust estimates of trade between countries, which is important for improving the quality of comparative economic data and analyzing vulnerabilities to the U.S. economy from foreign hacker activity.
