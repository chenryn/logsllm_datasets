Measuring the Shadow 
Economy
• Virtually all previous studies on measuring the 
size of the shadow economy focus on the 
aggregate shadow economy, usually 
expressed in terms of the size of the official 
economy.
• Little or no work attempting to estimate the 
size of specific shadow economy sectors 
within the context of the rest of the legal 
economy.
5
Shadow Economy in US
• Schneider and Enste (2000) estimate the total 
US shadow economy at between 8 and 10 
percent of US GDP, or from $1 to $1.4 trillion.
• Evidence on the size of specific sectors of the 
shadow economy in the US is largely 
anecdotal, and does not attempt to analyze 
how the shadow economy is linked to the 
official economy.
6
International Comparisons
• Estimates of the aggregate shadow 
economies of different countries vary widely.
• Some examples:
– The shadow economies of Thailand, Nigeria, and 
Egypt amount to about 70 percent of their 
respective GDP.
– The shadow economies of Guatemala, Mexico, 
Panama, and Peru amount to 40 to 60 percent of 
their respective GDP. 
– The shadow economies of the Philippines, Sri 
Lanka, Malaysia, and South Korea amount to 30 
to 50 percent of their respective GDP.

Why Shadow Economies Exist
• Analysis by Becker (1968) and others suggests that 
people engage in shadow economic activity for 
financial/economic gain, and weigh expected gains 
with expected costs (factoring in risk) in ways not 
inconsistent with the predictions of traditional 
economic theory.
• Some incentive areas include:
– Burden of taxes and social insurance contributions
– Intensity of regulation
– Social transfers
– Labor market regulation
– Public Sector Services
9
Incentive Issues
• Burden of taxes and social insurance contributions
– Differences between total cost of labor in the official 
economy and after-tax labor earnings provides an incentive 
to sell labor in the shadow economy.
– Loayza (1997) estimated the size of the shadow economies 
of 14 Latin American countries and found that greater tax 
burdens and labor market restrictions increased the size of 
the shadow economies of those countries.
• Intensity of regulation
– Increased regulation reduces individuals’ choices in the 
official economy.
– Shifting regulatory costs to employees provides incentives 
for workers to supply labor to the shadow economy.
10
Incentive Issues (continued)
• Social transfers
– The social welfare system can increase the marginal tax 
rate, thereby reducing incentives to work in the official 
economy.
– This system can also provide disincentives for individuals 
receiving welfare payments to seek work in the official 
economy.
• Labor market regulation
– Overregulation and labor costs in the official labor market 
are driving forces for the shadow economy (Schneider and 
Enste, 2000). 
– Forced reductions in working hours contrary to employee 
preferences increases the potential hours they can work in 
the shadow economy.
11
Incentive Issues (continued)
• Public Sector Services
– An increase in the shadow economy decreases government 
revenues, which can reduce the quantity and quality of public 
services.
– This can lead to increased taxes in the official sector which, along 
with the deterioration in the quality of public goods, can provide 
additional incentives to participate in the shadow economy.
– Johnson, Kaufmann, and Zoido-Lobatón (1998) show that smaller 
shadow economies appear in countries with higher tax revenues, if 
achieved by lower tax rates, fewer laws and regulations, and less 
bribery facing enterprises.
– They also find that countries with a better rule of law which is 
financed by tax revenues also have smaller shadow economies.
12
Shadow-Official Economy Links
• Previous work that attempts to link the official 
and shadow economies are macroeconomic.
• For example:
– Houston (1987) develops a business cycle model 
that includes tax and monetary policy linkages.
– Adam and Ginsburg (1985) focus on the 
implications of the shadow economy on official 
growth.
13
Focus on Information Sector
• The shadow information sector is 
composed of individuals and 
organizations engaged in:
– Computer system hacking 
– Trading stolen information
– Identity theft
– Spamming
– Other activities
14
Shadow Information Sector 
and Rest of Economy
• Input-Output (IO) models have long been 
used to examine inter-industry linkages and 
how, among other things, changes in final 
demand affect the demand for goods and 
services in specific industries.
• A preliminary input-output formulation of the 
US economy with an added shadow 
information sector is developed and 
presented.
15
Simplified 3-Sector Official 
Economy
• Consider a 3-sector economy with manufacturing, 
services and other, and information sectors. The 
economy is aggregated into these three sectors to 
simplify presentation.
• The following input-output table illustrates how these 
industries interact in the production of goods and 
services for our hypothetical economy.
• The figures are based on 2002 US economic 
statistics and are expressed in billions of dollars.
• Table shows 2002 GDP of approximately $10.7 
trillion.

Simplified 4-Sector Economy 
with Shadow Information Sector
•
Now consider two versions of the economy with an additional 
shadow information sector that accounts for either 1 or 3 
percent of official information sector output. 
•
In constructing this table, we do not change the other inter-
industry transactions, even though these would likely change 
given the overall reconstitution of economic activity that would 
occur.
•
The 1 to 3 percent range comes from the OECD report 
Measuring the Non-Observed Economy: A Handbook (2002) 
and are based on their lower- and upper-bound estimates of the 
size of the hacker economy in developed countries.
•
For the 1-percent case, the following input-output table 
illustrates how industries interact in the production of goods and 
services.

Discussion: 1-Percent Case
•
This hypothetical example shows possible interactions 
between the official and shadow economies.
•
2002 GDP is higher by a little over one percent ($10.75 
trillion) since we now include an an additional sector in the 
GDP calculation which were are now measuring.
•
This example only shows addition of shadow information 
sector. Other shadow sectors could be added. 
•
This example does not show other kinds of burdens imposed 
on the economy, such as additional spending by firms to 
monitor and prevent hacking activity.
•
Spending by firms to offset hacking would show up as higher 
expenditures by industries on output produced by the official 
information sector and possibly on other sectors.

Discussion: 3-Percent Case
•
2002 GDP is higher by a little over three percent ($11.01 trillion) 
since we now include an an additional sector in the GDP 
calculation which were are now measuring.
•
These examples, though largely hypothetical, give us some 
sense of how adding a shadow information sector would affect 
the national income and product accounts using the IO 
framework.
•
We could also add additional shadow components of other 
industries. Illegal drug manufacturing would, for example require 
additional shadow agricultural and shadow manufacturing 
sectors (as well as possible wholesale and retail sectors). 
22
Employment in the Hacker 
Economy
•
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 2007 
employment in the entire information industry was a little over 3 million 
persons, which is somewhat less than the 3.4 million employed in 2002.
•
If we apply the one percent figure that was used above to estimate the 
size of the shadow economy, we get an estimate of 2002-shadow 
information industry employment of 33,950 persons. 
•
The higher-end estimate of 3 percent of information industry output to 
estimate employment in the shadow information sector yields a 2002 
estimate of a 101,850 persons, but the same caveats apply.
•
However, this estimate must be treated with caution; a better method of 
estimating employment might be to develop estimates from the bottom-
up, i.e., based on estimates of employment in each of part of the 
shadow information sector and then combining these estimates.
23
Summary and Conclusions
•
One complication associated with developing reliable and stable 
estimates of the size of the hacker economy is that it is a sector that is 
in a continual state of flux; it changes as innovations occur in a highly 
innovative industry and the kinds of innovations that occur in the 
information sector are particularly difficult to forecast or foresee. 
•
More detailed information on the different hacker activities could be 
obtained with additional research and these estimates could be 
integrated into the broader economic framework discussed here. 
•
Progress on this front would also make measuring the burden that the 
various forms of hacking cause to the overall economy and to individual 
industries possible.
•
Additional analysis can include applying using the methodology 
developed here and refined further to other countries and using those 
comparisons to adjust estimates of trade between countries. This is not 
only important for improving the quality of information about 
comparative economic activity between countries, but could also see 
application in analyzing vulnerabilities to the US economy that result 
from hacker activity in foreign countries.
