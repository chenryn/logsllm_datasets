User: I had a problem where python was not finding modules installed by pip while in the virtualenv.
I have narrowed it down, and found that when I call python when my virtualenv in activated, it still reaches out to /usr/bin/python instead of /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python.
When I use which python in the virtualenv I get:
/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python
When I look up my $PATH variable in the virtualenv I get:
bash: /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin: No such file or directory
and yet when I actually run python it goes to /usr/bin/python
To make things more confusing to me, if I run python3.5 it grabs python3.5 from the correct directory (i.e. /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python3.5)
I have not touched /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/ in anyway. python and python3.5 are still both linked to python3 in that directory. Traversing to /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/ and running ./python, ./python3 or ./python3.5 all work normally.
I am using virtualenvwrapper if that makes a difference, however the problem seemed to occur recently, long after install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
Assistant: I'm currently having the same problem. Virtualenv was created in Windows, now I'm trying to run it from WSL.
In virtualenv I renamed python.exe to python3.exe(as I have only python3 command in WSL). In $PATH my virtualenv folder is first, there is no alias for python. I receive which python3
/usr/bin/python3. In /usr/bin/python3 there is symlink `python3 -> python3.6. I suppose it doesn't matter for order resolution.
