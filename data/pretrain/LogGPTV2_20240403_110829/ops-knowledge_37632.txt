To install OpenCV for Python 3 on Ubuntu 16.04, you can follow these steps to ensure that the correct version is installed without having to build from source:

1. **Update your package list:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev python3-numpy
   ```

3. **Add the Universe repository if it is not already enabled:**
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository universe
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

4. **Install OpenCV for Python 3:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y python3-opencv
   ```

If `python3-opencv` is not available in the repositories, you can use `pip3` to install OpenCV. First, ensure that `pip3` is installed and up-to-date:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
   sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip
   ```

Then, install OpenCV using `pip3`:
   ```bash
   sudo pip3 install opencv-python
   ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Multiple Python Installations:**
  If you have multiple versions of Python installed and Python 2 is the default, you can make Python 3 the default by updating the alternatives system:
  ```bash
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
  ```

- **Verify Installation:**
  To verify that OpenCV is installed correctly for Python 3, you can run a simple test script:
  ```python
  import cv2
  print(cv2.__version__)
  ```

Save this script as `test_opencv.py` and run it with Python 3:
```bash
python3 test_opencv.py
```

This should output the version of OpenCV installed, confirming that the installation was successful.

By following these steps, you should be able to install OpenCV for Python 3 on Ubuntu 16.04 without needing to build from source.
