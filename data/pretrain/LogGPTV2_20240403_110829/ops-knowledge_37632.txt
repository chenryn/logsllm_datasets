User: I want to install OpenCV for python3 in ubuntu 16.04.  Fist I tried running sudo apt-get install python3-opencv which is how I pretty much install all of my python software.  This could not find a repository.  The install does work however if I do sudo apt-get install python-opencv this issue with this is that by not adding the three to python it installs for python 2 which I do not use.  I would really perfer not to have to build and install from source so is there a way I can get a repository?  I also tried installing it with pip3 and it could not find it either.
Assistant: This is because you have multiple installations of python in your machine.You should make python3 the default, because by default is the python2.7
