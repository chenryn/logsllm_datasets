ABSTRACT
With our ever increasing dependence on computers, many govern-
ments have started to investigate regulations on vulnerabilities and
their lifecycle management. Although many previous works have
studied this problem space for mainstream software packages and
web applications, few studies have targeted consumer IoT devices.
As a first step towards filling this void, this paper presents a pilot
study on the vulnerability disclosures and patch release behaviors
related to 3 prominent consumer IoT vendors in Japan and 3 in the
United States. Our goals include (i) characterizing trends and risks
using accurate data that spans a long period, and (ii) identifying
problems, challenges, and potential approaches for future studies
of this problem space. To this end, we collected all published vul-
nerabilities and their patches for the consumer IoT products by the
included vendors between 2006 and 2017; then, we analyzed our
data from multiple perspectives such as the severity of the vulnera-
bilities and the timing of patch releases with respect to disclosures
and exploits. Our work has uncovered several findings that may
inform future studies, including (i) a stark contrast in the vulnera-
bility disclosures between the two countries and (ii) three alarming
vendor practices that may pose significant risks of 1-day exploits.

1 INTRODUCTION
As our society continues to increase its reliance on computers
large and small, vulnerabilities and their lifecycle management are
gradually becoming a matter of public safety. In response, many
governments have started to investigate regulating computer secu-
rity through legislation/standards setting, e.g., [18, 22]. As we might
expect, understanding the past and current practices of the stake-
holders in IoT vulnerability lifecycle management and identifying
potential improvements are important steps in these efforts.
Existing work on vulnerability lifecycle management can be clas-
sified into two groups based on where it falls with respect to the
time of discovery of a vulnerability. At a high level, work in the
pre-discovery group focuses on the prevention and discovery of
vulnerabilities, whereas work in the post-discovery group focuses
on the disclosure and notification of vulnerabilities as well as mit-
igations. In large part due to the myriad of ways and places for
vulnerabilities to creep in and the depth and breadth of vulnera-
bility prevention and discovery techniques, the literature in the
pre-discovery group is vast and continues to expand rapidly.
In comparison, the literature in the post-discovery group is con-
siderably smaller and there are two lines of work that are particu-
larly relevant to this paper. The first line studies the patch release
behavior of commercial and/or open-source developers (collectively
referred to as “vendors”). For example, previous studies have inves-
tigated the timeliness and the prioritization of patch releases, the
behavioral differences between commercial and open-source ven-
dors, and external factors that may improve their behaviors [1, 2, 7–
9, 26, 27]. The second line studies the characteristics of patches and
vulnerabilities. This includes measurements of diverse properties
such as the number of exploitations, the longevity of vulnerabili-
ties, the size and complexity of their patches, and the rate of patch
deployments [3, 6, 11, 17, 24, 30].
Incidentally, the overwhelming majority of the aforementioned
studies were dominated by mainstream software packages or web-
based applications. Based on our literature search, we are not aware
of any prior work that focused on consumer IoT devices, many of
which are products by vendors that have a small or even non-
existent representation in the datasets used by previous studies.
With the rapid rise of consumer IoT devices in recent years, we thus
believe it is high time to expand our knowledge in vulnerability
lifecycle management in regards to these devices and their vendors.

Events. Figure 1 depicts one possible timeline of a vulnerability
lifecycle, on which there are 6 events: (i) the vulnerability is intro-
duced by the vendor, (ii) the vulnerability is discovered by a finder,
(iii) the vulnerability is publicly disclosed by the finder, the coor-
dinator, or the vendor, (iv) the corresponding exploit is released,
(v) the corresponding patch is released, and (vi) the patch reaches
complete deployment. Note that while the first two events on any
timeline are always (i) and (ii), the remaining four can happen in
any order so long as (v) happens before (vi).
In this paper, we denote the public disclosure date by td, the
patch release date by tp, and the exploit release date by te. The
time difference (tp − td) is the patch availability delay and ideally it
should be small or even negative. Similarly, (tp −te) is the minimum
exploit window, which measures the time between patch availability
and the release of the first exploit known to us.
3 DATA COLLECTION METHODOLOGY
A significant portion of our effort was spent in collecting accurate
information on the vulnerability disclosures and patch releases
related to the included products. In this section, we will detail our
data collection process and justify our choices throughout. Our
overall data collection methodology is depicted in Figure 3.
3.1 Identify Target Countries
Our study initially did not distinguish among countries and our plan
was to include as many vendors as our budget allowed by selecting
vendors with the most number of consumer IoT products. However,
we quickly noticed that the selected vendors were strongly US-
centric, which raised questions regarding the applicability of our
findings to non-US markets. This gave us the inspiration to conduct
a novel study that explores individual markets separately and look
for differences. In the end, we settled on the markets of JP and US
because: (i) these markets are large and thus important economies,
(ii) they have two of the oldest national CSIRTs, namely CERT/CC
(est. 1988) and JPCERT/CC (est. 1996), and (iii) our team is highly
familiar with these markets. From here on, “our dataset” refers to
the combined dataset; we will call out a specific subset when need,
e.g., “the JP dataset”.
Figure 2: Included Vendors and #CVE-IDs.
As a first step towards filling this void, this paper presents a pilot
study on the vulnerability disclosures and patch release behaviors
related to prominent consumer IoT vendors. A key novelty in our
study is the recognition that, even though we are in a global econ-
omy, consumer purchase decisions in different countries are heavily
localized. Therefore, individual markets may show different trends
and risks, and yet these trends and risks may also be correlated due
to global trade. To cater for these possibilities, we have thus decided
to allocate our effort by markets and analyze them accordingly.
In this paper, we will present our study using data covering 3
prominent consumer IoT vendors in Japan (JP) and 3 in the United
States (US) as well as their geographical subsidiaries in Australia
(AU), China (CN), and Germany (DE). Following the data collec-
tion procedure described in §3, our dataset includes 53 and 230
completed CVE entries [19] for respectively the JP and US markets,
covering the 12 years from 2006 to 2017. Aside from characterizing
vendor behaviors, our data analysis in §4 also validates the impor-
tance of including multiple markets. As an example, we found that
97.9% of the disclosures in our JP dataset are coordinated, but the
corresponding US figure is only 55.8%. We will drill into this dif-
ference and offer a plausible explanation in §4.3. Finally, our study
also uncovered three alarming vendor practices presented in §5: (i)
incremental patch release, (ii) unsynchronized patch release, and
(iii) implicit end-of-support. Our analysis in an accompanying tech
report [20] shows how these practices may pose significant risks
of 1-day exploits due to patch-based exploit generation.
2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we will briefly review the roles and the events in
vulnerability lifecycles.
Roles. Our paper follows the terminology in [10, §3]. To quote, the
vendor is “the individual or organization that created or maintains
the product that is vulnerable”; the coordinator is “an individual
or organization that facilitates the coordinated response process”;
the finder is “the individual or organization that identifies the vul-
nerability”; and the deployer is “the individual or organization that
must deploy a patch or take other remediation action”.
1Note that #CVE-IDs in this table counts all 2006–2017 entries involving a vendor. The
corresponding numbers for just consumer IoT devices are shown in Figure 4.

Early on in our study, we were already aware that we did not have
enough resource to include every consumer IoT vendor in JP and
US. Not only are there a large number of them given the broad
interpretation of “consumer IoT devices”, but we also noticed the
crawled data contained a non-trivial number of missing fields that
require manual investigations. Therefore, we decided to prioritize
prominent vendors and included as many as our budget allowed. To
this end, we used the number of wireless routers offered by a vendor
to approximate its prominence, then include every consumer IoT
devices by these vendors. This resulted in a dataset where ∼70% of
the products are wireless routers and ∼30% are in other categories
such as network camera and NAS.
To select vendors, first we decided to use Kakaku.com and Ama-
zon.com as representative shopping sites for JP and US respectively.
Then, we ranked the vendors using the number of products re-
turned to the query “wireless routers” on the two sites.2 Figure 2
shows the top 4 vendors in our search conducted in April 2018. Our
original plan was to include the top 3 vendors from each site, but we
ended up selecting 3 out of the top 4 vendors in both. In JP, the 2nd-
ranked vendor was ELECOM. Although ELECOM is a well-known
consumer device vendor in JP and has many products, surprisingly
no CVE ID was associated with it. In US, the top-ranked vendor
was Synergy Digital. However, this vendor also had no associated
CVE ID because it mainly sells batteries.
3.3 Identify Target Vulnerabilities
Having fixed the vendors, we used the NVD to identify all CVE
entries related to their consumer IoT devices in three steps. First, we
retrieved all CVE entries involving the included vendors from the
NVD. While this should be straightforward in principle, in practice
we have to screen for orthographical variants of vendor names.
Using the vendor I-O DATA as an example, we were able to discover
three different spellings in the NVD: “iodata”, “i-o_data”, and “i-
o_data_device”. Second, we excluded non-consumer-IoT entries,
which explains the drop in #CVE-IDs between Figures 2 and 4. As an
example, we excluded CVE-2017-2137, which pertains to an access
restriction bypass in Netgear ProSAFE Plus Configuration Utility
and is not related to a consumer IoT device. Third, we restricted our
dataset to CVE entries in the 12 years 2006–2017 because, as we
will explain below, we critically depend on the Japan Vulnerability
Notes iPedia [14] but this feed dates back to 2006 only.
3.4 Collect Vulnerability & Patch Information
After determining the included CVE entries, we collected the fol-
lowing 6 pieces of information on each vulnerability.
(1) Affected Products and (2) Versions. We started by extracting
the affected product names and versions from the NVD. Unfortu-
nately, we encountered a number of empty results when extracting
the affected versions, which mirrors the experience reported in [21].
To combat this, we cross-referenced every CVE entry in NVD with
its corresponding entry in JVN and extract the missing information
from the JVN entry, if available. In addition, we also extracted from
