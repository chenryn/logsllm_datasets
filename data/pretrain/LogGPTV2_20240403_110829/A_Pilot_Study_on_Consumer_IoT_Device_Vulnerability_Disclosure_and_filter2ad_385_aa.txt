## Abstract
With the increasing reliance on computers, many governments are investigating regulations for vulnerability management. While previous studies have focused on mainstream software and web applications, few have targeted consumer IoT devices. This paper presents a pilot study on vulnerability disclosures and patch release behaviors of three prominent consumer IoT vendors in Japan and three in the United States. Our goals are to (i) characterize trends and risks using accurate, long-term data and (ii) identify problems, challenges, and potential approaches for future studies. We collected all published vulnerabilities and patches for the consumer IoT products by these vendors between 2006 and 2017 and analyzed the data from multiple perspectives, including the severity of vulnerabilities and the timing of patch releases relative to disclosures and exploits. Our findings include (i) significant differences in vulnerability disclosures between the two countries and (ii) three concerning vendor practices that may pose significant risks of 1-day exploits.

## 1 Introduction
As society's dependence on computers grows, the management of vulnerabilities has become a matter of public safety. Many governments are exploring regulatory measures for computer security. Understanding past and current practices in IoT vulnerability management and identifying potential improvements are crucial steps in these efforts.

Existing work on vulnerability lifecycle management can be categorized into pre-discovery and post-discovery phases. Pre-discovery work focuses on prevention and discovery, while post-discovery work focuses on disclosure, notification, and mitigation. The literature on pre-discovery is extensive and rapidly expanding, whereas the post-discovery literature is smaller but includes studies on patch release behavior and the characteristics of patches and vulnerabilities.

Most prior studies have focused on mainstream software and web applications. To our knowledge, no prior work has specifically targeted consumer IoT devices. Given the rapid rise of consumer IoT devices, it is essential to expand our understanding of vulnerability management for these devices and their vendors.

## 2 Background
In this section, we review the roles and events in vulnerability lifecycles.

### Roles
- **Vendor**: The individual or organization that created or maintains the vulnerable product.
- **Coordinator**: An individual or organization that facilitates the coordinated response process.
- **Finder**: The individual or organization that identifies the vulnerability.
- **Deployer**: The individual or organization that deploys a patch or takes other remediation actions.

### Events
A typical vulnerability lifecycle includes:
1. The vulnerability is introduced by the vendor.
2. The vulnerability is discovered by a finder.
3. The vulnerability is publicly disclosed by the finder, coordinator, or vendor.
4. The corresponding exploit is released.
5. The corresponding patch is released.
6. The patch reaches complete deployment.

We denote the public disclosure date as \( t_d \), the patch release date as \( t_p \), and the exploit release date as \( t_e \). The patch availability delay is \( (t_p - t_d) \), and the minimum exploit window is \( (t_p - t_e) \).

## 3 Data Collection Methodology
A significant portion of our effort was spent collecting accurate information on vulnerability disclosures and patch releases related to the included products. Our overall data collection methodology is depicted in Figure 3.

### 3.1 Identify Target Countries
Initially, we did not distinguish among countries and planned to include as many vendors as possible. However, we noticed that the selected vendors were strongly US-centric, which raised questions about the applicability of our findings to non-US markets. This led us to focus on the Japanese (JP) and US markets due to their importance, the presence of national CSIRTs, and our team's familiarity with these markets.

### 3.2 Identify Target Vendors
Given resource constraints, we prioritized prominent vendors. We used the number of wireless routers offered by a vendor to approximate its prominence and included all consumer IoT devices by these vendors. We used Kakaku.com and Amazon.com to rank vendors based on the number of wireless routers they offered. Figure 2 shows the top 4 vendors in our search conducted in April 2018. We selected 3 out of the top 4 vendors in both countries, excluding vendors with no associated CVE IDs.

### 3.3 Identify Target Vulnerabilities
We used the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify all CVE entries related to the included vendors' consumer IoT devices. We screened for orthographical variants of vendor names, excluded non-consumer-IoT entries, and restricted our dataset to CVE entries from 2006 to 2017.

### 3.4 Collect Vulnerability and Patch Information
For each vulnerability, we collected the following information:
1. **Affected Products and Versions**: Extracted from the NVD, cross-referenced with JVN when necessary.
2. **Public Disclosure Date (\( t_d \))**
3. **Patch Release Date (\( t_p \))**
4. **Exploit Release Date (\( t_e \))**

## 4 Data Analysis
Our dataset includes 53 completed CVE entries for the JP market and 230 for the US market, covering the years 2006 to 2017. Our analysis characterizes vendor behaviors and validates the importance of including multiple markets. For example, 97.9% of the disclosures in our JP dataset are coordinated, compared to only 55.8% in the US dataset. We also uncovered three concerning vendor practices:
1. **Incremental Patch Release**
2. **Unsynchronized Patch Release**
3. **Implicit End-of-Support**

These practices may pose significant risks of 1-day exploits due to patch-based exploit generation, as detailed in an accompanying technical report [20].

## 5 Conclusion
This pilot study provides insights into the vulnerability disclosures and patch release behaviors of consumer IoT vendors in Japan and the United States. Our findings highlight significant differences between the two countries and identify concerning vendor practices. Future studies should further investigate these issues to improve the security of consumer IoT devices.
