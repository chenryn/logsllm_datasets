User: How to use command line tools for file transfer under Linux? Please provide specific steps.
Assistant: The following command line tools can be used for file transfer under Linux: 1. SCP command: The SCP command can transfer files between local and remote servers, and it is very simple to use. For example, to transfer the file file.txt from the local to the /home/username directory of the remote server: ``` scp file.txt username@remote:/home/username ``` Among them, username is the username of the remote server, and remote is the server address. 2. SFTP command: SFTP command can transfer and browse files between local and remote servers, and it is very easy to use. For example, to connect to a remote server: ``` sftp username@remote ``` Then you can use a series of commands to transfer files, such as uploading files: ``` put file.txt /home/username ``` 3. Rsync command : The Rsync command can perform file synchronization between local and remote servers, which is very suitable for large-scale file transfers. For example, to synchronize all files in the local directory /home/user1 to the remote server directory /home/user2: ``` rsync -avz /home/user1/ username@remote:/home/user2/ ``` where, -a indicates archive mode, -v indicates detailed output information, and -z indicates compressed transmission.
