User: i have installed many python modules plugins and libraries in my centos system.
Now i don't want to install each thing again on separate computers.
Is there any way i can make the package like rpm or any other thing so that when i install in in new location all the modules, dependencies also gets installed and everytime i install new thing i can update the install package
Assistant: If you have installed the packages with pip (an improved easy_install), you can just do pip freeze > my-reqs.txt to get a list and versions of the installed packages. There is also some option to install using the reqs file, which I can not remember right now.
Pip is meant to companion virtualenv, which can be used to handle per project requirements of dependent packages.
