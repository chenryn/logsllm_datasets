## Motivation
The motivation for this research stems from the potential for remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips. For instance, the 35C3 talk on Broadcom Bluetooth RCE and the Frankenstein Fuzzer project highlight the risks associated with these wireless technologies. However, Wi-Fi often has more privileges than Bluetooth, making it a more attractive target for escalation.

## Introduction to Spectra
Spectra is a speculative spectrum transmission attack that leverages the shared 2.4 GHz frequency band used by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even LTE. In small devices like smartphones, these wireless technologies can interfere with each other, leading to performance optimization through enhanced coexistence mechanisms. However, these mechanisms also introduce observable side effects, such as transmission delays and coordination, which can be exploited to create side channels. Attackers with code execution privileges can escalate between wireless cores without additional checks by the operating system.

## Impact of Spectra
Spectra can have several significant impacts:
1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - One wireless core can deny transmission to another core.
2. **Information Disclosure**
   - One wireless core can infer data or actions of the other core.
3. **Code Execution**
   - One wireless core can execute code within the other core.

## Broadcom Coexistence
Broadcom's coexistence mechanisms are widely used in various devices, including:
- **Apple**: All iPhones, MacBooks, iMacs, and older Apple Watches.
- **Samsung**: Galaxy S and Note series in Europe.
- **Google**: Older devices like Nexus 5/6P.
- **Raspberry Pi** and IoT devices like Fitbit Ionic.

These devices often lack firmware checks, making them ideal for prototyping and testing.

### Example: BCM4339 Datasheet
From the BCM4339 datasheet (used in Google Nexus 5), we can see how coexistence is managed within the chip.

### Collaborative Coexistence Interface
The AN214852 document describes the collaborative coexistence interface between Cypress-to-Cypress solutions and Cypress-to-third-party chips. Disabling the Enhanced Coexistence Interface (ECI) significantly degrades throughput, making it impractical for real-world use.

### Serial Enhanced Coexistence Interface (SECI)
- **Separate Boards**: Bluetooth (CYW20719) and Wi-Fi (CYW490307) boards are separate.
- **Connection**: The only connection between them is the SECI.
- **Antennas**: Separate antennas are used to exclude side effects.
- **Debugging**: Logic analyzers are used for debugging.

## Vulnerabilities and Exploits
### CVE-2019-15063
- **Description**: When Bluetooth writes to the `gci_chipcontrol` register at `0x650200`, it crashes Wi-Fi.
- **Observation**: A voltage drop is observed with a logic analyzer.
- **Impact**: Causes a kernel panic on various devices, and Wi-Fi PCIe behaves erratically afterward.
- **Demo**: macOS Kernel Panic Demo

### Broadcom Wi-Fi Architecture
Since the BCM94303 (2003) and BCM94318E (2006), the architecture has remained largely the same:
- **Initial Version**: Soft MAC Linux host talks directly with low-level hardware.
- **Newer Versions**: Full MAC with an additional ARM core offloads almost all operations.

### D11 Core: A Specialized Microcontroller
- **Functionality**: Controls Tx and Rx engines, handles channel access scheduling, retransmission, and filters incoming packets.
- **Access**: Direct access to PHY registers, radio, and coexistence interfaces.
- **Memory**: Up to 64kB ucode memory and 8kB own RAM.
- **Accuracy**: Sub-µs accuracy and multiple interfaces, including SECI.

### Breaking the Grant/Reject Scheme
- **CVE-2020-10370**: When Wi-Fi stops sending SECI messages, Bluetooth stops transmitting packets, causing a DoS.
- **Observation**: SECI messages are polled every 1.25ms by the Wi-Fi D11 core.
- **Impact**: Can infer keystroke timings and keypress amounts, leading to information disclosure.

### RAM Sharing
- **CVE-2020-10368**: Bluetooth can read information from the Wi-Fi RAM starting at register `0x680000`.
- **CVE-2020-10367**: Bluetooth can write data to the Wi-Fi RAM starting at register `0x680000`, allowing for code execution.

### Code Execution
- **Exploit**: Writing to `0x681024` in Bluetooth can gain Wi-Fi code execution on a Samsung Galaxy S10.
- **Demo**: iOS Kernel Panic Demo

## Other Chips and Standards
- **Proprietary Coexistence Features**: Many manufacturers, including Intel, MediaTek, Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, Marvell, and NXP, have similar coexistence interfaces.
- **Vulnerability Scope**: Some wireless chips do not separate wireless cores, making them less vulnerable to Spectra. However, operating system-based side channels might still exist.

## Summary
Spectra is a speculative spectrum transmission attack that exploits coexistence mechanisms in wireless chips. It can lead to Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, and Code Execution. The research highlights the importance of securing these interfaces and the need for robust firmware checks.
