## Abstract
Information about the privacy and security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is not readily available to consumers, making it difficult for them to make informed purchase decisions. While legislators have proposed adding succinct, consumer-accessible labels, they do not provide guidance on the content of these labels. This paper reports on a series of interviews and surveys with privacy and security experts, as well as consumers, to explore and test the design space for the content of an IoT privacy and security label.

We conducted an expert elicitation study using a three-round Delphi process with 22 privacy and security experts to identify the factors that are important for consumers when comparing the privacy and security of IoT devices. Based on the criticality of each factor in conveying risk to consumers, we distributed these factors across two layers: a primary layer for display on the product package or website, and a secondary layer available online through a web link or QR code. We also report on the experts' rationale and arguments for their choices.

To understand how consumers would perceive the privacy and security information specified by experts, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 participants who had purchased at least one IoT device (smart home device or wearable). Based on the results of our expert elicitation and consumer studies, we propose a prototype privacy and security label to help consumers make more informed IoT-related purchase decisions.

## I. Introduction
The rapid growth in the development and deployment of IoT devices has brought numerous privacy and security issues to light. Incidents such as Amazon Alexa sending private conversations to random contacts and baby monitors being hacked have been widely reported. Even well-known manufacturers like Google and Amazon have faced criticism for lack of transparency regarding their data practices.

Surveys indicate that consumers are increasingly concerned about the collection and sharing of their personal data. For example, a Mozilla survey found that 45% of respondents were most concerned about privacy in the context of IoT. Similarly, a survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) found that 92% of participants were concerned about their privacy and wanted control over the personal information collected by smart devices.

While consumers are interested in purchasing smart devices, they desire more information about the privacy and security of these devices. Currently, there is limited public information available to inform their purchase decisions. Some resources, such as the Mozilla "Privacy Not Included" website and a report by the UK Information Commissioner's Office, provide some information but cover only a few aspects of privacy and security.

In May 2019, the UK Digital Ministers proposed mandating security labels for IoT devices, covering three security practices: no default passwords, vulnerability disclosure programs, and the lifetime of security updates. However, this plan does not specify the detailed information that should be included on the labels.

Given the importance of presenting the most relevant information in a digestible form, we sought the opinions of privacy and security experts. We conducted interviews and surveys with 22 experts from various backgrounds, including industry, academia, government, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Using the iterative Delphi methodology, we developed a consensus around important factors and their reasons for inclusion.

We designed a prototype layered label based on our expert elicitation study and conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 consumers of IoT devices. Our findings show that all participants understood the information on the primary layer, and while some secondary layer information was less understandable, participants still desired its inclusion to be fully informed.

Our contributions include:
- Distilling a list of privacy and security factors to identify the most important information for IoT labels.
- Partitioning the most important factors into primary and secondary layers.
- Proposing a prototype IoT label based on expert and consumer feedback.

## II. Background and Related Work
### A. Consumers' Privacy and Security Concerns and Preferences
Numerous studies have shown that consumers are increasingly concerned about the privacy and security of IoT devices. These concerns vary based on factors such as the type and purpose of data collection and the retention of collected data. Despite these concerns, consumers continue to purchase IoT devices, often due to their perceived convenience and features. This discrepancy is sometimes referred to as the "privacy paradox."

### B. Product Labels
Product labels, such as food nutrition and energy labels, have been used to aid consumers' purchase decisions. Food nutrition labels, for example, were developed to decrease obesity by helping consumers choose healthier products. The effectiveness of these labels depends on factors such as consumers' attention, knowledge, and socio-demographic factors. Research has shown that privacy "nutrition labels" on websites help users find important information faster and more accurately compared to traditional privacy policies.

### C. Privacy and Security Guidelines and Best Practices
A literature review by Tanczer et al. identified 19 overarching principles related to security best practices for consumer IoT devices. The most common principles included strong authentication by default, reliable and cryptographically signed security updates, encryption by default, and compliance and risk assessment. While the industry acknowledges the importance of selling secure IoT devices, they prefer self-regulation over government intervention. However, a recent UK government report recommended mandating specific requirements for IoT devices to improve security.

## III. Methodology
### A. Expert Elicitation Study
Our goal was to identify factors that experts believed would be useful to include on a privacy and security label for IoT devices and to understand their rationale for selecting each factor. We conducted an in-depth, semi-structured interview study followed by two rounds of surveys with 22 privacy and security experts. To capture a wide range of opinions, we recruited experts from academia, industry, government, and NGOs, with diverse expertise in software, hardware, policy, standards, and user experience.

#### 1. Participant Recruitment and Compensation
To ensure a broad range of expert opinions, we recruited experts from various sectors and provided appropriate compensation for their participation.
