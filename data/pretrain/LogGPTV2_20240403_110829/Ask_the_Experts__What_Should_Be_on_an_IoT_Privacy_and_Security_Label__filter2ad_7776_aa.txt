Abstract—Information about the privacy and security of Inter-
net of Things (IoT) devices is not readily available to consumers
who want to consider it before making purchase decisions. While
legislators have proposed adding succinct, consumer accessible,
labels, they do not provide guidance on the content of these
labels. In this paper, we report on the results of a series of
interviews and surveys with privacy and security experts, as well
as consumers, where we explore and test the design space of
the content to include on an IoT privacy and security label. We
conduct an expert elicitation study by following a three-round
Delphi process with 22 privacy and security experts to identify the
factors that experts believed are important for consumers when
comparing the privacy and security of IoT devices to inform
their purchase decisions. Based on how critical experts believed
each factor is in conveying risk to consumers, we distributed
these factors across two layers—a primary layer to display on
the product package itself or prominently on a website, and a
secondary layer available online through a web link or a QR
code. We report on the experts’ rationale and arguments used to
support their choice of factors. Moreover, to study how consumers
would perceive the privacy and security information speciﬁed by
experts, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with
15 participants, who had purchased at least one IoT device (smart
home device or wearable). Based on the results of our expert
elicitation and consumer studies, we propose a prototype privacy
and security label to help consumers make more informed IoT-
related purchase decisions.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth in the development and deployment
of IoT devices worldwide, large numbers of privacy and
security issues have come to light [88]. The popular press
has reported on incidents such as Amazon Alexa sending
private conversations to a random phone contact [58] and
baby monitors getting hacked [95]. Even well-known IoT
manufacturers have faced criticism for lack of transparency
about their data practices. For instance, recent news articles
reported that Google forgot to mention that its Nest Secure hub
has a microphone [76] and Amazon revealed that in addition
to artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms, human employees listen to
a subset of audio recordings from Echo devices [90].
Surveys have indicated that consumers are indeed worried
about the collection of their personal data and who it is being
sold to or shared with [16], [97]. Privacy is of particular concern
to users of IoT devices. Mozilla surveyed 190,000 participants
around the world and found that privacy is the biggest IoT-
related concern for 45% of the respondents [15]. In a survey
conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) of over
1,600 IoT consumers, 92% of participants were concerned
about their privacy and wanted to have control over personal
information collected by smart devices [56], [81].
While consumers are increasingly interested in purchasing
smart devices [43], [79], a recent survey conducted in the
United Kingdom showed that security and privacy are key
pieces of information that participants would like to consider
when purchasing them [46]. Similarly, an interview-based study
of IoT consumers reported that almost all participants desired to
have information about the privacy and security of IoT devices
at the time of purchase [37]. Currently, there is little public
information about the privacy and security of IoT devices that
consumers can access to inform their purchase decisions [11].
Some resources, such as the Mozilla “Privacy Not Included”
website [71] and a report published by the UK Information
Commissioner’s Ofﬁce [50], provide information about speciﬁc
IoT devices or address limited privacy and security factors.
Critical privacy and security information could be provided to
consumers by including it prominently on a privacy and security
label accompanying the device. This could also increase
consumers’ trust in the device manufacturer [106]. In a May
2019 proposal, the UK Digital Ministers declared their intention
to mandate security labels for IoT devices, with the goal of
notifying consumers about security aspects of these devices [32].
However, this plan only covers three security practices: using
no default passwords, having a vulnerability disclosure program
in place, and specifying the lifetime of security updates. Other
proposals for IoT privacy and security labels fail to specify
the speciﬁc information that consumers should be presented
with on the label [30], [38], [40], [62], [66], [74], [80].
Given consumers’ scarce attention, presenting them with
the most relevant security and privacy information in the most
digestible form is crucial. To determine the most important
information to include on IoT privacy and security labels, we
solicited the opinions of privacy and security experts. In various
ﬁelds, expert elicitation has been used effectively for research
and decision-making [8], [54], [86], [102], [103], particularly
under uncertainty and when necessary information cannot be
obtained from other sources [21], [47], [55].
We conducted interviews and surveys with 22 privacy
and security experts. To get different perspectives, we re-
cruited experts from industry, academia, government, and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). We also ensured that
these experts come from different backgrounds related to IoT
(software, hardware, and policy). We used the iterative Delphi
methodology (explained further in Section III) to develop a
consensus among the experts around important factors and an
understanding of their reasons for or against including each
factor. Overall, we found that differences in opinions were
driven less by fundamental differences in beliefs, but rather
by differences in work experience and priorities. For example,
some experts were more knowledgeable about speciﬁc security
mechanisms, standards, or regulations, and prioritized factors
related to their area of expertise or their organization’s mission.
Prior research has shown that security experts might analyze
the same artifacts differently depending on their background
in speciﬁc security domains [48].
Most factors identiﬁed as important by experts are factors
that they believe will inform consumers. Experts also identiﬁed
some factors for inclusion that could inform experts only,
mostly to be able to hold companies accountable.
Prior studies suggest that layered labels can be effective [23],
[37], [83], [96]. A layered label includes a primary layer that
presents the most important and glanceable content, followed
by a secondary layer for additional information. In our study,
we asked experts to specify the layer on which the information
should be included on the label. They mostly recommend
putting only information that would be understandable and
important to most consumers on the primary layer.
We designed a prototype layered label based on our expert
elicitation study. We then conducted semi-structured interviews
with 15 consumers of IoT devices (smart home devices or
wearables) and presented our prototype to them. We show
that all of our participants had a clear understanding of
the information presented on the primary layer of the label.
Although some of the factors on the secondary layer of the label
were less understandable to participants who lacked privacy
and security expertise, all of our participants reported that
they still want such information to be included on the label
mainly to be as informed as possible. In addition, consumer
participants reported that having all the important privacy and
security factors, even unfamiliar ones, on the label would help
them easily search online to ﬁnd more information.
We make the following contributions in this paper:
• We distill an extensive list of privacy and security factors
to identify the most important pieces of information to
include on IoT labels.
• We partition the most important factors into two layers: the
primary factors we want consumers to notice and consume
at a glance, and the secondary factors that require more
space to effectively convey risk to consumers.
• Based on our expert and consumer interviews and surveys,
we propose a prototype IoT label that includes the most
important factors with proposed groupings.
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we ﬁrst outline prior research on understand-
ing consumers’ privacy and security related concerns for IoT
devices. Next, we provide background on how labels have
been used in different contexts to inform consumers’ choices.
Finally, we discuss reports and recommendations on privacy
and security best practices for consumer IoT devices.
A. Consumers’ Privacy and Security Concerns and Preferences
Numerous studies have demonstrated that consumers are
increasingly concerned about the privacy and security of IoT
devices [5], [15], [45], [87]. Researchers have shown that
the extent of these concerns depends on factors such as the
type of data collected, the purpose of data collection, and the
retention of collected data. Lee and Kobsa [59], [60] explored
factors related to IoT data collection and found that people are
more concerned about data being collected in private locations
compared to public locations. In addition, they found that
people’s concerns depend on the type of data being collected.
In a previous study Naeini et al. used vignettes to study how
different factors can explain variations in comfort level related
to data collected by sensors. They found that factors such as the
purpose of data collection and the retention time signiﬁcantly
impact people’s privacy-related concerns [73].
Despite such concerns, consumers are still purchasing
IoT devices, mostly due to their perceived convenience and
features [18]. This is sometimes referred to as a “privacy
paradox,” thanks to the discrepancy between privacy concerns
and actions taken to mitigate those concerns [1]. One cause for
this could be that consumers are provided with little, or often
no, privacy and security information about IoT devices prior to
purchase [10], [11], [30], [37]. This prevents consumers from
making informed IoT-related purchase decisions and increases
the risk of privacy and security vulnerabilities, which may lead
to high-proﬁle and large-scale attacks targeting IoT devices [4].
B. Product Labels
Product labels, such as food nutrition and energy labels, have
been used to aid consumers’ purchase decisions. Food nutrition
labels, in particular, were developed to decrease obesity by
helping consumers purchase healthier food products [33]. Other
objectives of food nutrition labels include encouraging food
companies to compete to produce healthier products and allow-
ing governments to support consumers’ health-related behaviors
without mandating speciﬁc nutritional requirements [53].
The effectiveness of food nutrition labels has been shown to
depend on factors such as consumers’ attention at the point of
sale [92], whether the consumer is purchasing the product for
children, aiming to lose weight, and/or purchasing the product
for the ﬁrst time [84], [104], their nutrition-related knowledge,
health condition [25], [34], and socio-demographic factors.
Studies have also shown the limitations of nutrition labels in
effectively communicating nutrition information to consumers
to improve eating habits [35], [49]. Despite these shortcomings,
these studies demonstrate that food nutrition labels signiﬁcantly
inform consumers’ purchase decisions [70], [75].
In the realm of privacy, researchers have explored the impact
of privacy “nutrition labels” on websites. They found that
privacy labels help users ﬁnd important information faster and
more accurately, as compared to ﬁnding such information in
traditional privacy policies [52].
C. Privacy and Security Guidelines and Best Practices
Tanczer et al. [93] conducted an extensive literature review
on publicly available reports from industry associations and
international organizations on their security-related proposals
and recommendations for consumer IoT devices. They reviewed
17 industry reports (including from Intel, HP, and Consumer
Technology Association) and policy reports (including from
European Commission, International Organization for Stan-
dardization (ISO), and Alliance for the Internet of Things
Innovation (AIOTI)). This review observed 19 overarching
principles related to security best practices that were referred
to at least twice in these reports. The most common principles
(mentioned in at least 10 reports) were strong authentication by
default, reliable and cryptographically signed security updates,
encryption by default, and compliance and risk assessment.
Some of the other principles were related to physical security,
vulnerability reporting and disclosures, and secure device boot.
The security factors that we synthesized based on our expert
elicitation study covered all of the most frequent security
principles mentioned in this literature review [93].
Tanczer et al. concluded that in general, the industry acknowl-
edges the importance of selling safe and secure IoT devices in
the market and would like to work alongside the government as
part of their efforts. However, they are more interested in self-
regulation than in government interventions [93]. For example
companies can self-certify their IoT devices using a framework
developed by IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) that speciﬁes
ﬁve levels of compliance [51].
A recent UK government
report argued against self-
regulation, noting the lack of incentives for IoT companies to
adhere to security best practices when designing IoT products.
The report recommended that the government mandate speciﬁc
requirements for IoT devices as a mechanism to improve the
security of consumer IoT products [31]. These requirements
are no default password, availability of a vulnerability dis-
closure program, and security updates. These recommended
requirements all are included in our privacy and security label
(see Figures 3 and 4).
Notably, all the reviewed reports above focused on devices’
security mechanisms with few references to data privacy
considerations. As consumers are concerned about both the
privacy and security of their devices, in our work we asked
experts and consumers about both privacy policies and security
mechanisms that should be included on a label.
III. METHODOLOGY
We ﬁrst conducted an expert elicitation study to specify
the content of a privacy and security label for IoT devices.
We complemented the expert study with a series of 15 semi-
structured interviews with non-expert consumers and iterated
on the label design.
A. Expert Elicitation Study
In the expert elicitation study, our overarching goals were
to identify factors that experts believed would be useful to
include on a privacy and security label for IoT devices and
to understand the experts’ rationale for selecting each factor.
We conducted an in-depth, semi-structured interview study,
followed by two rounds of surveys with 22 privacy and security
experts. The process is depicted in Figure 2.

a wide range of expert opinions, we recruited experts from
academia, industry, government, and non-governmental orga-
