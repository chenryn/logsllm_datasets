Question: "An Android application is attempting to begin a cryptographic operation using a key with specific authorizations. The key has Tag::PURPOSE set to KeyPurpose::SIGN and contains a Tag::ORIGINATION_EXPIRE_DATETIME. The current date and time are later than the value of Tag::ORIGINATION_EXPIRE_DATETIME. What will be the result of calling the `begin` method for a cryptographic operation with this key?"
 "A": "The method will return ErrorCode::UNSUPPORTED_PURPOSE because the Tag::PURPOSE does not match the operation."
 "B": "The method will return ErrorCode::KEY_EXPIRED because the current date and time are later than the Tag::ORIGINATION_EXPIRE_DATETIME."
 "C": "The method will begin the operation successfully as Tag::ORIGINATION_EXPIRE_DATETIME is not enforced for KeyPurpose::SIGN."
 "D": "The method will return ErrorCode::KEY_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED as the date and time check indicates excessive use of the key."
Answer: B
