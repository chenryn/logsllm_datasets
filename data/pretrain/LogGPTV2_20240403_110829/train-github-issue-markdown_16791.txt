There is a bit of a UI bug when going from a selected dropdown item to one of
its subitems. See:
![example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/96e00cd2e58e2f3642c2b34b3fa5beea29d681e89374013d7143097a3243d9a7/687474703a2f2f7374617469632e74756d626c722e636f6d2f396867737779732f6955316d6a386336792f626f6f7473747261702d6275672e676966)
Increasing the delay is one way to solve it, but the other is to detect the
direction of the mouse cursor and apply a delay when the cursor is moving
towards one of the submenus.
This repository implements this (see example of how it works here.
It would be nice to have this as Bootstrap's default behavior.
