### Title: BlackHat: US-21 - Use & Abuse of Personal Information

**Abstract:**

Almost every significant online interaction necessitates the creation of a user profile, which typically involves the submission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This PII, including names, ages, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and demographic data, is often linked to the IP address of the device used to access the service. Service providers use this information to verify and track user activity, as well as to tailor their responses. While users generally understand and accept that their information will be used to enhance their experience, many are unaware of the extent to which their personal information is misused or abused.

In this presentation, we delve into the various ways in which online entities and their affiliates exploit personal information. Our findings are based on a 12-month study that monitored email, phone, SMS text, and web scraping activities for 300 fabricated identities across approximately 200 distinct organizations. The goal was to identify which companies act in the best interest of consumers and which contribute to the proliferation of robocalls and spam. 

The study involved one-time interactions with these online entities, resulting in the collection of 16,584 emails, 948 voicemails, and 753 text messages. Beyond quantifying the volume of activity associated with these identities, we constructed a graph to illustrate the sharing of information. We also analyzed the content received, applying a quantitative rubric to published privacy policies, political and special interest leanings, and sought evidence of foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Our dataset, which provides a comprehensive view of the misuse of personal information, will be made available for further research and investigation.
