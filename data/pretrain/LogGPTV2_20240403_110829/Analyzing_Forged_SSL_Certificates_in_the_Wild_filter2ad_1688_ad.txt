the smaller chain size). A small number of certiﬁcate
chains were larger than 5 KB in size, where the size
overhead might have a negative impact on page load time
for victim users.
• Certiﬁcate chain depths. Table IV shows the distribution
of certiﬁcate chain length. Here, we refer to the certiﬁcate
chain depth as the number of certiﬁcates (including any
intermediate CA certiﬁcates) actually transmitted during
the SSL handshake. We note that on most websites, the
certiﬁcate chains normally do not include the issuing root
CA certiﬁcate (since trusted CA certiﬁcates are presumed
to be installed on the client, thus omitted in transmission).
The majority of the forged certiﬁcate chains have a
depth of one, which only contained the server’s end
entity certiﬁcate without any intermediate certiﬁcates.
Since most commercial CAs nowadays issue certiﬁcates
using intermediate keys (rather than their root keys), one
should probably raise some suspicion when encountering
certiﬁcate chains with a depth of one. There were 55 of
the forged certiﬁcates that had a depth of 3 or larger,
which is actually longer than the website’s legitimate
certiﬁcate chain. For these certiﬁcate chains, additional
cryptographic computations or even online revocation
checks on the client might be required, since the client
needs to verify signatures for all of the intermediate
certiﬁcates when establishing an SSL connection. On
slower devices, the additional veriﬁcation time might be
noticeable by the victim user.
• Public key sizes. Table V shows the RSA public key sizes
in bits carried in the forged certiﬁcates. Most of the forged
certiﬁcates had either 1024-bit or 2048-bit public keys,
which are not characteristically different from legitimate
SSL certiﬁcates (although websites should transition to
2048-bit or stronger RSA keys by 2014 according to the
CA/Browser forum’s recommendations). We noticed that
a few certiﬁcates actually contained relatively weak 512-

bit public keys. These users may have become further
vulnerable to a second attacker given the considerably
weakened public key.
B. Certiﬁcate Subjects
First, Table VI shows the subject organizations of forged
certiﬁcates. As expected, the majority of them spoofed the
organization as Facebook. There were over a hundred forged
certiﬁcates that excluded the organization attribute entirely.
Again, we conﬁrmed 93 certiﬁcates that were attributed to
Fortinet Ltd.
Next, we inspect the observed subject common names of the
forged SSL certiﬁcates, summarized in Table VII. Normally,
the subject common name of the SSL certiﬁcate should match
the hostname of the website to avoid triggering SSL certiﬁcate
warnings in the browser. While most of the forged certiﬁcates
used the legitimate website’s domains as the subject common
name, there were a few certiﬁcates that used unrelated domains
as well.
Unsurprisingly, most of the forged SSL certiﬁcates used the
wildcard domain *.facebook.com as the subject common
name in order to avoid certiﬁcate name validation errors.
This suggests that most of the attacking entities were either
speciﬁcally targeting Facebook’s website by pre-generating
certiﬁcates that match the website’s name, or using automated
tools to generate the certiﬁcates on-the-ﬂy. None of the forged
certiﬁcates were straight clones of Facebook’s legitimate cer-
tiﬁcates (that replicated all the X.509 extension ﬁelds and
values). There were some certiﬁcates that used IP addresses as
common name, for example, 69.171.255.255 (which ap-
pears to be one of Facebook’s server IP addresses). We noticed
that a number of forged certiﬁcates used a subject name that
starts with two characters FG concatenated with a long numeric
string (e.g. FG600B3909600500). These certiﬁcates were
issued by Fortinet Ltd., a company that manufactures SSL
proxy devices which offer man-in-the-middle SSL inspection.
Similarly, we found 8 certiﬁcates that had a subject common
name “labris.security.gateway SSL Filtering Proxy,” which is
also an SSL proxy device. There were a few other common
names observed that were likely amateur attempts of SSL
interception, such as localhost.localdomain, which
is the default common name when generating a self-signed
certiﬁcate using the OpenSSL library.
For the forged SSL certiﬁcates that did not use a subject
common name with facebook.com as sufﬁx, we also
checked if any subject alternative names were present in the
certiﬁcate. Subject alternative names are treated as additional
subject names, and allow certiﬁcates to be shared across
multiple distinct hostnames. This may allow attackers to gen-
erate a single forged certiﬁcate for attacking multiple different
websites. For the 233 forged certiﬁcates that did not provide a
matching common name, none of them provided a matching
subject alternative name. Even though these 233 (3.4%) forged
certiﬁcates would deﬁnitely trigger name mismatch errors,
there is still a signiﬁcant possibility that users may ignore
the browser’s security warnings anyway.
C. Certiﬁcate Issuers
In this section, we examine the issuer organizations and is-
suer common names of each forged SSL certiﬁcate. Table VIII
lists the top issuer organizations of the forged certiﬁcates.
At ﬁrst glance, we noticed several forged certiﬁcates that
fraudulently speciﬁed legitimate organizations as the issuer,
including 5 using Facebook, 4 using Thawte, and one using
VeriSign. These invalid certiﬁcates were not actually issued
by the legitimate companies or CAs, and were clearly mali-
cious attempts of SSL interception. Since 166 of the forged
certiﬁcates did not specify its issuer organization (or empty),
we also checked the issuer common names, listed in Table IX.
We manually categorized the certiﬁcate issuers of forged
certiﬁcates into antivirus, ﬁrewalls, parental control software,
adware, and malware. Notably, we observed an intriguing
issuer named IopFailZeroAccessCreate that turned out to
be produced by malware, which we discuss in detail below.
• Antivirus. By far the top occurring issuer was Bitde-
fender with 2, 682 certiﬁcates, an antivirus software prod-
uct which featured a “Scan SSL” option for decrypting
SSL trafﬁc. According to their product description, Bit-
defender scans SSL trafﬁc for the presence of malware,
phishing, and spam. The second most common issuer was
ESET with 1, 722 certiﬁcates, another antivirus software
product
that provides SSL decryption capabilities for
similar purposes. Several other top issuers were also ven-
dors of antivirus software, such as BullGuard, Kaspersky
Lab, Nordnet, DefenderPro, etc. These software could
possibly avoid triggering the browser’s security errors by
installing their self-signed root certiﬁcates into the client’s

system. Note that the observed antivirus-related certiﬁcate
counts are not representative of the general antivirus
usage share of the website’s users, since SSL interception
is often an optional feature in these products. However,
if any antivirus software enabled SSL interception by
default, we would expect a higher number of their forged
certiﬁcates observed.
Supposing that these users intentionally installed the an-
tivirus software on their hosts, and deliberately turned on
SSL scanning, then these antivirus-generated certiﬁcates
would be less alarming. However, one should be wary of
professional attackers that might be capable of stealing
the private key of the signing certiﬁcate from antivirus
vendors, which may essentially allow them to spy on the
antivirus’ users (since the antivirus’ root certiﬁcate would
be trusted by the client). Hypothetically, governments
could also compel antivirus vendors to hand over their
signing keys.
• Firewalls. The second most popular category of forged
certiﬁcates belongs to commercial network security appli-
ances that perform web content ﬁltering or virus scanning
on SSL trafﬁc. As observed in the certiﬁcate subject
ﬁelds, Fortinet was one of the issuers that manufactures
