  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
zypper_module
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.1.0
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
##### SUMMARY
I have in a role a tasks/main.yml which contains:
      - include: library/setup_packages.yml
        vars:
          pkg:   "{{ item }}"
          state: present
        with_items:
          - "{{ wanted_packages | default([]) }}"
        tags:
          - packages
and a library/setup_packages.yml which contains:
    ---
      - debug:
          msg:   "{{ pkg }} -> {{ state }}"
      - zypper:
          pkg:   "{{ pkg }}"
          state: "{{ state }}"
When I call this with a list wanted_packages like this:  
wanted_packages:
  * rlwrap=0.37-2.1
This fails for me because there are two versions of rlwrap in the repository
directory. Only the older one is installable in my context. So I tried to set
a specific version. But the zypper module generates a commandline with both
"rlwrap=0.37-2.1" AND "rlwrap" which leads into a failure.  
The output is:
    TASK [oracle : debug] **********************************************************
    ok: [hhlokora12-tpl] => {
        "msg": "rlwrap=0.37-2.1 -> present"
    }
    TASK [oracle : zypper] *********************************************************
    fatal: [hhlokora12-tpl]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "cmd": ["/usr/bin/zypper", "--quiet", "--non-interactive", "--xmlout", "install", "--type", "package", "--auto-agree-with-licenses", "--no-recommends", "--oldpackage", "--", "rlwrap=0.37-2.1", "rlwrap"], "failed": true, "msg": "Zypper run command failed with return code 4.", "rc": 4, "stderr": "", "stdout": "\n\n\nProblem: nothing provides libreadline.so.5()(64bit) needed by rlwrap-0.42-24.1.x86_64\n Solution 1: do not install rlwrap-0.42-24.1.x86_64\n Solution 2: break rlwrap-0.42-24.1.x86_64 by ignoring some of its dependencies\n\nChoose from above solutions by number or cancel\n\n\n\n\n\n", "stdout_lines": ["", "", "", "Problem: nothing provides libreadline.so.5()(64bit) needed by rlwrap-0.42-24.1.x86_64", " Solution 1: do not install rlwrap-0.42-24.1.x86_64", " Solution 2: break rlwrap-0.42-24.1.x86_64 by ignoring some of its dependencies", "", "Choose from above solutions by number or cancel", "", "", "", "", ""]}
Why is it expanding to both?  
If it is needed a switch like exact_version or so which leads only to the
specific version would be nice.
