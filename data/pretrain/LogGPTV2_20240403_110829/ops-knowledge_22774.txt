User: I am running a Python script in Ubuntu. The script uses gstreamer.  I get the following error message.
error: no element "h264parse"
Let me know if any other information would be helpful.
Assistant: h264parse is part of the "gst-plugins-bad" , you will want to install them through your package manager, if your script imports Gst from gi.repository you will want the 1.0 plugins, the 0.10 otherwise.
Have a nice day :)
