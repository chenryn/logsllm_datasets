 Comparing Apples and Oranges 
OT is hardware and software that detects or causes a change through the direct 
monitoring and/or control of physical devices, processes and events in the 
enterprise. (Gartner) 
OT is a category of hardware and software that monitors and controls how 
physical devices perform. (SearchData.com) 
OT is the hardware and software dedicated to detecting or causing changes in 
physical processes through direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices 
such as valves, pumps, etc. (Wikipedia)

   What is Operational Technology? OT 
Industrial Control System (ICS) is a term used to encompass the 
many applications and uses of industrial and facility control and 
automation systems. ISA-99/IEC 62443 is using Industrial 
Automation and Control Systems (ISA-62443.01.01) with one 
proposed definition being “a collection of personnel, hardware, 
and software that can affect or influence the safe, secure, and 
reliable operation of an industrial process.” (SANS) 
Industrial control system (ICS) is a general term that encompasses 
several types of control systems, including SCADA systems, DCS, 
and other control system configurations such as PLC often found 
in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures. (NIST)

Risk of death and serious injury 
•
Loss of production 
•
Environmental impact

•
Financial loss 
  The need to secure ICS 
9 
•
Historically, IT and OT have had fairly separate 
roles and were managed separately within an 
organization 
•
ICS were traditionally developed using 
specialized hardware and proprietary software 
•
Deployed as standalone platforms using 
vendor proprietary communication protocols 
to communicate with similar systems 
  IT-OT Convergence 
10 
•
Reduce manufacturing and operational costs. 
•
Increase productivity. 
•
Provide access to real-time information. 
•
Utilize modern networking systems to interconnect 
ICS with business and external networks. 
•
ICS vendors also switched to using commercial-off-
the-shelf equipment and software to build their 
systems 
  IT-OT Convergence 
11 
•
Integration of technology such as Windows OS, SQL, and 
Ethernet means that ICS are now vulnerable to the same 
viruses, worms and trojans that affect IT systems. 
•
Enterprise Integration of legacy ICS means they are 
vulnerable to attacks which they were not designed for. 
•
Not all IT security solutions are suitable for ICSs because 
of fundamental differences between  
ICS and IT systems. 
  Challenges in IT-OT Convergence 
12 
OS 
Ethernet 
ICS security goal: AIC (Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality) 
•
Operational availability means it is very difficult and costly to 
interrupt these systems for security updates 
•
ICS lifecycle is usually 10 to 20 years and are  
typically not built with security in mind. 
•
Firmware and software are not replaced 
for a long time, patches are rarely applied,  
and network devices can be disrupted by malformed          
network traffic or even high volumes of well-formed traffic. 
  Challenges in IT-OT Convergence 
13 
ICS 
Lifecycle 
•
ICS patching requires testing, approval, scheduling, 
and validation to ensure safe and repeatable control. 
•
All updates, including patches and virus definition 
files, have to be thoroughly tested with the ICS 
before being approved for installation. 
•
ICS often include safety instrumented system (SIS) 
  Challenges in IT-OT Convergence 
14 
•
Most ICS are supported by outside 
vendors, and are deployed with default 
configuration settings. 
•
Demand for 24/7 remote access for 
engineering, operations or technical 
support means more insecure or rogue 
connections to ICS. 
•
Manuals on ICS equipment are publicly 
available to both would-be attackers and 
legitimate users.

• American Petroleum Institute (API): API-
1164 - Pipeline SCADA Security, 2nd ed. 
• National ICS Security Standard (Qatar), v3, 
Mar 2014 
• Australian Signals Directorate (ASD): 
Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security 
Incidents – Mitigation Details, Feb 2017 
(Note: It claims implementing the Top 4 
can mitigate over 85% of intrusions) 
  Industrial Cyber Security Assessment 
18 
• In any security policy implementation, risk 
and security assessments are the starting 
point 
• Security assessments analyse your current 
state, from technologies to policies, 
procedures to behaviour 
• It offers a realistic picture of your security 
posture (current risk state) and what it will 
take (mitigation techniques) to get to 
where you need to be (acceptable risk 
state) 
  Cyber Security Assessment & Tools 
19 
• NIST “Framework for Improving Critical 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity” 
• The Framework is voluntary guidance, 
based on existing standards, guidelines, 
and practices, for critical infrastructure 
organizations to better manage and reduce 
cybersecurity risk 
• It identifies five essential program 
activities: Identify, Protect, Detect, 
Respond, Recover. 
  Cyber Security Assessment & Tools 
20 
• Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) 
from ICS-CERT (of DHS) 
• A free desktop software tool that asks 
the users a series of questions to 
evaluate their ICS and IT network 
security practices based on recognized 
industry standards 
  System Controls in ICS 
21 
• Defense-in-depth approach: Employs 
multiple layers of defense (physical, 
procedural and electronic) at separate 
levels. The layers are: 
• Policies, Procedures and Awareness 
• Physical Security 
• Network Security 
• Computer Hardening 
• Application Security 
• Device Hardening

• Uses the concept of zones to 
subdivide an Enterprise and ICS 
network into logical segments 
comprising of systems

  Security Application for ICS in the making 
25 
• Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
• Anomaly-based Detection 
• Must teach system to identify “normal” network traffic 
• Detects deviations from normal behaviour 
• More difficult to spoof 
• Needs no foreknowledge of attack signatures 
• May raise more false positives 
• Very hard to implement in a dynamic environment 
• Machine learning increasingly being used to form 
the baseline of “normal” network traffic

  Benefits of DPI for OT 
27 
•
Enhanced visibility of device interactions – far beyond traditional firewalls 
(ex: data flow, commands, values etc.)  
•
Enforced rules on commands & values consistent with the rules of the process 
•
Option to lock down unused functionality (commands/registers) 
•
Detect/protect configuration/firmware changes to ICS endpoints 
•
Validation of messages per protocol standards 
•
Limitation of messages and commands to un-safe operational scenarios 
•
Limits impact of potential human error 
•
Passive implementation that reduces risk of interrupting existing system 
•
A holistic baseline of interconnected systems for application whitelisting 
  Summary 
28 
•
Cybersecurity needs to be an integral part of the IT/OT convergence.  
•
IT and OT were supported and managed separately. IT was traditionally associated with 
business/enterprise systems while OT was associated with field devices and systems for 
monitoring and control. 
•
Need to understand IT security may not apply correctly to OT cybersecurity. 
•
Legacy in technology is one of the many challenges faced where OT devices have virtually no 
security capabilities as compared to an IT device.  
•
Not such thing as 100% secure. It’s all about: 
•
Risk reduction – reduction attack surface, reduce exploitation likelihood. 
•
Impact Mitigation – eliminate or reduce impact that cause loss of lives, equipment 
damage, environmental impact. 
•
Have a back-up operational mode
