### Sender Identity and Effectiveness

Previous studies have compared the effectiveness of notifications sent by humans to those sent by automated systems [39]. Zeng et al. collaborated with Google, sending some messages via the Google Search Console and others via a UC Berkeley email account [45]. In all three studies, the differences in effectiveness between different senders were minimal and, where reported, statistically insignificant.

At first glance, this appears to conflict with our results, which show that UNI-LAW was significantly more effective than UNI-CS. One possible interpretation is that name recognition alone does not make a significant difference (explaining why previous studies, even with the support of well-known companies like Google, did not observe significant differences). Instead, recipients may consider whether the sender can and will plausibly impose consequences for inaction. They might believe that a computer science group is unlikely to pursue legal action, whereas a message citing legal regulations from a private individual or legal experts poses a more credible threat. This aligns with prior research on framing and incentives, which we will discuss next.

### Framing and Incentives

Zeng et al. compared different framings for issues such as outdated TLS configurations and misconfigured or expiring certificates, using either a user focus (explaining the impact on users) or a technical focus (explaining the technical background) [45]. Unlike our study, they did not observe statistically significant differences in remediation rates, possibly because a main incentive (the fact that users may be blocked from accessing the website) was present in both framings.

Other studies used stronger incentives, such as browser warnings [31] or quarantining infected users and denying them internet access until they remediated [14, 15]. Notably, Çetin et al. found that quarantine networks were more effective than email notifications [15]. These results suggest that providing direct incentives for remediation may be a promising approach. Our study indicates that regulatory requirements and associated fines can serve as such an incentive.

### Recipient Trust

Similar to our findings, prior studies reported that recipients often mistrusted notifications [14, 15, 39, 45] and sought verification [14, 15]. We found that while some factors improved trust for many recipients, the same factors decreased trust for a minority. Establishing trust remains a challenge, especially given the prevalence of fraudulent messages on the internet.

### Support Tools

Several prior studies reported that recipients requested automated systems to assist in remediation [13, 30, 31, 45]. Çetin et al. evaluated the effect of providing a tool and found that it did not have a statistically significant effect on remediation [13]. While we did not repeat this experiment, our results indicate that providing a tool may have other benefits, such as simplifying support for recipients, potentially reducing the number of support requests, and increasing trust.

### Reminders

Previous research on the effect of reminder messages has been inconclusive, with Stock et al. finding a small effect [38], while Li et al. found none [30]. In our case, 29.7% of websites that were still non-compliant after the first message remediated after the reminder, with some groups showing over 40% additional remediations (cf. Table 4). Thus, reminders were clearly effective. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear. In our survey, some recipients mentioned that reminders promoted trust. Others had partially remediated and completed the process after receiving the reminder. However, this does not explain why previous studies did not see similar results. More research is needed to understand the effectiveness of reminders.

### Summary

Our study confirms many of the results from previous studies: gaining recipients' trust is difficult, and providing them with automated systems to validate their fixes is perceived as helpful. We also observed that awareness does not necessarily lead to action, indicating that system operators may need incentives for remediation and potential negative consequences for inaction. Such consequences can include browser warnings that deter customers [45], denying end-users internet access [14, 15], or potential fees for violating relevant legislation. However, our results also challenge previous findings by showing that the identity of the sender and the use of reminders can have significant effects on overall remediation. More research is needed to understand the interplay of these factors.

### Limitations

#### Internal Validity
Our study has four limitations regarding internal validity:
1. **Self-Selection**: Two types of self-selection may affect the results. First, the group assignment of sites that provide only an email or postal address in the imprint (87 and 152 owners, respectively, about 6% of non-CONTROL recipients). Second, survey participants may have higher trust in our messages, making them more likely to respond.
2. **Compliance Checker**: Our compliance checker does not confirm cookie consent banners, potentially leading to misdetection of GA removal. No indicators of this issue were found during the two-month study period.
3. **Incorrect Reminders**: Part of the LETTER – UNI-LAW group received incorrect reminders, the effect of which we cannot quantify. Some recipients may have received messages from multiple groups, but the impact of this on remediation is unknown.
4. **Email Servers**: We used three different email servers, which may have led to different delivery rates due to spam classification. The mail servers of UNI-LAW were not configured with SPF and DKIM records. However, similar bounce rates and high CheckGA access rates for the UNI-LAW group suggest that server differences did not significantly affect deliverability.

#### External Validity
Our results are subject to two limitations regarding external validity:
1. **Sample Representation**: While we aimed for a diversified set of websites, our sample is not representative of the overall population of websites in Germany.
2. **Cultural and Legal Differences**: All observations relate to German site owners. It is unknown whether our insights apply to other countries with different legal regimes and cultures. Compliance issues are rooted in local laws and must be addressed specifically for each country. Tailoring notifications through local partners may be a promising approach for researchers.

### Conclusion

Our study indicates that effective notification campaigns on the web are a matter of trust, framing, and support. Based on a covert experiment with 4,594 website owners running 4,754 websites that used Google Analytics without IP anonymization, our notifications led to an overall remediation rate of 56.6%, a significant increase compared to the 9.2% of the control group.

A survey with 477 responses allowed us to identify formal and content-related factors that influenced recipients' trust in the notification. We also collected initial impressions of how website owners solved the problem and which support they benefited from, showing a high demand for our self-service tool and support via email or phone. More research is needed into how this type of support can be standardized and scaled for larger notification campaigns.

According to our results, reminding website owners about legal obligations can increase remediation rates by over 20 percentage points. Thus, even senders without authority to impose fines can motivate site owners to remediate a misconfiguration. Parties interested in running a notification campaign may benefit from consulting with legal experts to ensure the legality of their notification and to frame the issue as one of compliance.

Finally, we found that most website owners were unaware of their non-compliance before our notification, with 19.5% of survey respondents not even knowing their website was using GA. Additionally, 36% of remediating site owners chose to completely remove GA, and several took their websites offline. Thus, notification campaigns may also motivate website owners to disable unmaintained systems, improving the privacy and security posture of the web.
