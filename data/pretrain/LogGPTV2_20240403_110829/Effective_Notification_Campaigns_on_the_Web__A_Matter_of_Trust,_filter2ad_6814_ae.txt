appeared to come from a human from those appearing to
come from an automated system [39], while Zeng et al. col-
laborated with Google to send part of their messages via the
Google Search Console, with the others being sent via Email
from a UC Berkeley account [45]. In all three studies, the dif-
ferences between the different senders were small and, where
this was reported, statistically insigniﬁcant.
At ﬁrst glance, this conﬂicts with our results, which show
UNI-LAW to be signiﬁcantly more effective than UNI-CS. A
possible interpretation is that name recognition does not make
a difference (explaining why previous studies, even with the
support of a well-known company like Google, did not ob-
serve signiﬁcant differences). Instead, recipients consider if
the sender can and will plausibly impose consequences for
inaction. They may believe that a computer science group is
unlikely to pursue legal action, while a message citing legal
regulations sent by a private individual or legal experts is a
stronger incentive, as the sender poses a more plausible threat.
This would be in line with prior research into framing and
incentives, which we will consider next.
Framing and Incentives Zeng et al. compared different
framings for issues such as outdated TLS conﬁgurations and
misconﬁgured or expiring certiﬁcates, using either a user fo-
cus (explaining the impact on the user) or a technical focus
(explaining the technical background) [45]. Unlike our study,
they did not observe statistically signiﬁcant differences in re-
mediation rates, which may be related to the fact that a main
incentive (the fact that users may be blocked from accessing
the website) was present in both framings.
Other studies used stronger incentives, like browser warn-
ings [31] or quarantining infected users and refusing them
access to the Internet until they remediated [14, 15]. Of par-
ticular note is the study by Çetin et al., which compared email
notiﬁcations with quarantine networks and found the latter to
be more effective [15]. These results indicate that providing
direct incentives for remediation may be a promising avenue.
Our study suggests that regulatory requirements and the asso-
ciated ﬁnes can serve as such an incentive.
Recipients (Dis)trust Similar to our results, prior studies
reported that recipients often mistrusted the notiﬁcations
[14, 15, 39, 45] and reached out for veriﬁcation [14, 15]. We
found that while some factors were reported as improving
trust, the same factors were also decreasing trust for a mi-
nority of recipients. Reliably establishing trust remains an
unsolved challenge, especially due to the prevalence of fraud-
ulent messages Internet users are faced with.
Support Tools Several prior studies reported that recipi-
ents asked for automated systems to assist in remediation
[13, 30, 31, 45]. Çetin et al. conducted a study to evaluate
the effect of providing a tool and found that providing or
withholding it did not have a statistically signiﬁcant effect on
remediation [13]. While we did not repeat this experiment, our
results indicate that, regardless of the effect on remediation,
providing a tool may have other beneﬁts, such as simplify-
ing support for recipients, potentially reducing the amount of
support requests, and increasing trust.
Reminders Previous research on the effect of reminder
messages has been inconclusive, with Stock et al. ﬁnding
a small effect [38], while Li et al. found none [30]. In our
case, 29.7 % of websites that were still non-compliant after
the ﬁrst message remediated after the reminder, with some
groups showing over 40 % additional remediations (cf. Ta-
ble 4). Thus, reminders were obviously effective. The reasons
for this discrepancy remain unclear. In our survey, some recip-
ients named the reminders as a trust-promoting factor. Others
had remediated incompletely, and completed the remediation
after receiving the reminder. However, this does not explain
why previous studies did not see similar results. More research
is needed to understand the effectiveness of reminders.
Summary Our study conﬁrms many of the results of previ-
ous studies: Gaining the recipients’ trust is difﬁcult, and pro-
viding them with automated systems to validate their ﬁxes is
perceived as helpful. We also once again observed that aware-
ness does not necessarily lead to action, which indicates that
it may be helpful to provide system operators with incentives
for remediation, and potential negative consequences from
inaction. Such consequences can take the form of browser
warnings that scare off customers [45], denying end users
access to the Internet [14, 15], or potential fees for violating
relevant legislation. However, our results also call into ques-
tion previous results by showing that the identity of the sender
and the sending of reminders can have signiﬁcant effects on
overall remediation. More research is needed to understand
the interplay of these factors.
7.4 Limitations
Regarding internal validity, our study has four limitations.
Firstly, there are two kinds of potential self-selection. The
ﬁrst kind affects the group assignment of those sites that either
provide only an email or a postal address in the imprint. This
is the case for 87 and 152 owners, respectively, i. e., about 6 %
of non-CONTROL recipients. The second kind of self-selection
affects the survey. Our participants can be assumed to have a
higher trust in our messages since distrusting our messages
makes them less likely to respond to our survey invitation.
Secondly, our compliance checker does not conﬁrm cookie
consent banners. Thus, any tracking that takes place after
giving consent is not detected. We could thus misdetect the
introduction of a consent banner as removal of GA. We have
found no indicator that this has happened during the two
months of the study, but did not check all websites.

Thirdly, we sent incorrect reminders to part of the LETTER
– UNI-LAW group, the effect of which we are unable to quan-
tify. However, the most important trends were already visible
before the reminders were sent. We also received indications
that a low number of recipients received messages from more
than one group (e. g., because more than one website was
operated by the same web design agency but listed different
owners in their imprints). We are unable to quantify the poten-
tial effects this may have had on remediation due to observer
effects based on the suspicion of being part of a study.
Fourthly, we used three different email servers, which may
have led to different message delivery rates due to spam clas-
siﬁcation. As we did not control the mail servers, we could
not subscribe to spam reporting services. As in previous stud-
ies [12, 45], this setup may have introduced an impossible-
to-quantify bias. We also found after the fact that the mail
servers of UNI-LAW were not conﬁgured with Sender Policy
Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identiﬁed Mail (DKIM)
records. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that the different mail
servers do not have a large effect on the deliverability of our
notiﬁcations. First of all, we observed similar bounce rates for
the three different senders, and the rates at which CheckGA
was accessed were actually highest for the UNI-LAW group.
Secondly, we sent only relatively small numbers of mails,
all of them with slightly different content, to individual mail
servers. The 1337 recipient addresses are spread over 516
distinct second-level domains. For further clariﬁcation, we
analyzed the diversity of affected mail servers a few months
after the end of the study. According to the results, the average
number of addresses handled by individual mail providers is
2.5 (median: 1). Even commonly used mail providers like
Google and Outlook.com received only 70 and 108 mails,
respectively—and these mails were submitted over a period
of ﬁve days using three different sending servers.
External validity of our results is subject to two limitations.
Firstly, while we aimed to obtain a diversiﬁed set of websites,
our sample is not representative for the overall population
of websites in Germany. Secondly, and more importantly,
all of our observations relate to German site owners, i. e.,
it is unknown whether our insights apply to other countries
with different legal regimes and cultures. This limitation is a
consequence of our compliance-focused approach. Compli-
ance issues are rooted in local laws and have to be addressed
speciﬁcally for every country. While compliance-based notiﬁ-
cations appear to increase the pressure to act for German site
owners, we cannot say anything about their effectiveness in
other countries. The effort of tailoring notiﬁcations on a per-
country level may be higher, but this approach does have its
advantages: better message comprehension and trust through
name recognition of the involved organizations. Thus, it may
be a promising avenue for researchers to relay notiﬁcations
through local partners (similar to [29, 30, 31]) who can relate
the issue to the respective local laws [20].
8 Conclusion
Our study indicates that effective notiﬁcation campaigns on
the web are a matter of trust, framing, and support. We reach
this conclusion based on a covert experiment with 4594 web-
site owners running 4754 websites that used Google Analytics
(GA) without IP Anonymization, i. e., failing to comply with
current European data protection regulation. Our notiﬁcations
led to an overall remediation rate of 56.6 %, a signiﬁcant
increase compared to the 9.2 % of the control group.
In addition, a survey with 477 responses allowed us to
identify a number of formal and content-related factors that
inﬂuenced the recipients’ trust in the notiﬁcation. We also
collected ﬁrst impressions of how website owners solved the
problem and which support they beneﬁted from, showing that
there was a high demand for our self-service tool, but also for
support via email or phone. More research is needed into how
this type of support can be standardized and scaled for larger
notiﬁcation campaigns.
According to our results, reminding website owners about
legal obligations can increase remediation rates by over 20
percentage points. Thus, even senders without any authority to
impose ﬁnes themselves can motivate site owners to remediate
a misconﬁguration. Parties interested in running a notiﬁcation
campaign may be well-advised to consult with legal experts,
not only to ensure the legality of their own notiﬁcation but
also to investigate if the topic of the notiﬁcation can be framed
as an issue of compliance.
Finally, we found that most website owners were unaware
of their non-compliance before our notiﬁcation, with 19.5 %
of survey respondents not even being aware that their website
was using GA. Further, 36 % of the remediating site owners
chose to completely remove GA, and several website own-
ers took their websites ofﬂine. Thus, notiﬁcation campaigns
may also motivate website owners to disable unmaintained
systems, including analytics tools whose data is never viewed
or even complete sites that are obsolete to them, improving
the privacy and security posture of the Web.
