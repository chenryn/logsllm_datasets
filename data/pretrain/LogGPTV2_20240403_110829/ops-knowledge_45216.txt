User: How to use Grafana and Prometheus to achieve monitoring and measurement standardization, and generate specified reports?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Grafana and Prometheus to achieve monitoring and measurement standardization, and generate specified reports: 1. Install and configure Prometheus: Install Prometheus and create a configuration file, which includes the target and indicator information to be monitored. 2. Install and configure Grafana: Install Grafana and configure Prometheus as a data source. Create dashboards and panels to visualize monitoring data. 3. Standardized metrics: Use Prometheus' query language (PromQL) and Grafana's dashboard panels to standardize monitoring templates. Employing metric normalization helps to compare metric values and metric data over different periods. 4. Generate reports: Use the report and alert functions on the Grafana interface to customize and generate specified reports. 5. Data backup: regularly back up historical data of Prometheus to provide support for subsequent query, analysis and monitoring operations. The steps above allow system administrators to monitor in real time and generate detailed reports to ensure application health.
