Impact of the Problem Size: Fig. 5(a) shows the execution
time of the proposed resiliency framework for the k−resilient
observability veriﬁcation with respect to the problem size. We
vary the problem size by considering different IEEE bus test
systems. As the SCADA system is randomly generated, we
take at least three random inputs for each type of experiment,
while each speciﬁc experiment is run at least ﬁve times. The

lies between linear and quadratic
orders. For a speciﬁc bus size, we also observe that
the
execution time differs for sat and unsat results, while the
latter takes a longer time than the former. We observe a
similar growth in k−resilient secured observability veriﬁcation
(Fig. 5(b)), although the time requirement is a little high. This
is because, in this case, the resiliency model needs to consider
the constraints of secured communication, and as a result, the
model size increases.
It is important to note that the problem size principally de-
pends on two topologies: bus topology and SCADA topology.
The bus topology mainly includes the buses and the power
transmission lines, where the latter has a quadratic order with
respect to the number of buses. The SCADA topology includes
RTUs and IEDs whose numbers are proportional to the number
of buses. The number of communication lines also follows a
quadratic order in terms of the number of SCADA devices.
Therefore, the complexity of the problem has a quadratic
upper bound in general with respect to the number of buses.
However, an important feature of power grid networks is that
the average degree of a node (or bus) is roughly 3, regardless of
the number of buses in the system [9]. The degree of a node
in the SCADA topology is also very low. This feature can
explain why the observed complexity is not strictly quadratic.
Impact of the Hierarchy Level: We also analyzed the impact
of the hierarchy level on the model execution time. Fig. 6(a)
and Fig. 6(b) present the evaluation results for the 14 and
57-bus test systems. The results shows that
the execution
time decreases for the satisﬁable results while it mostly
increases for the unsatisﬁable results. This is because, with
the increase of the hierarchy, some RTUs become important,
and consequently the threat space increases. As a result, the
search time for a threat vector decreases. With the unsatisﬁable
cases, to conclude that there is no threat vector, the model

needs to search the whole problem space and thus execution
time increases.
C. Resiliency Analysis
Maximum Resiliency Analysis: We run experiments in differ-
ent SCADA networks with respect to the number of measure-
ments for the 14-bus system. The number of measurements
is represented as the percentage of the maximum possible
measurements for a bus system [10]. We change the resiliency
requirements with respect to the number of IED failures and
RTU failures from smaller values to larger values. The result
shows that the larger the number of measurements, the higher
the maximum possible resiliency. Although this behavior de-
pends on the SCADA network and the dependency among
the measurements, IEDs, and RTUs, we consider arbitrary
SCADA systems as we have described in Section V-A. The
results are shown in Fig. 7(a). We ﬁnd that an SCADA system
can tolerate a larger number of IED failures than that of RTU
failures. This is because the RTUs are often responsible for
multiple IEDs for their communication with the MTU. As a
result, one RTU failure often has larger impact compared to
IED failures.
Resiliency Threat Space Analysis: In Fig. 7(b), we show the
threat space varying the hierarchy level for the 14-bus system.
We observe that the higher the hierarchy level, the larger
the threat space (i.e., the number of potential threat vectors).
The increase in hierarchy creates more dependency among the
RTUs and IEDs as there is more connectivity among the RTUs.
As a result, there is more scope for contingencies that can
violate the resiliency speciﬁcations, and so the threat space
increases. Moreover, if we increase the resiliency speciﬁca-
tions the threat space becomes larger.
VI. RELATED WORK
The security policy misconﬁguration and its veriﬁcation
have been studied extensively [11], [12], [13], [14] for more
than a decade. In these approaches, the formal deﬁnition of
conﬁguration anomalies and safe deployment of single or
multiple security devices are proposed and algorithms are
presented to discover conﬁguration inconsistency. There are
also a number of works on risk-based security conﬁguration
analysis. Risk analysis and security hardening using attack
graphs is proposed by several researchers [15], [16], [17].
However, all these above mentioned security analysis tools
are proposed for analyzing misconﬁguration problems in tra-
ditional networks. These tools cannot be applied for security
or resiliency analysis in smart grids as it requires considering
different cyber-physical operations and security controls.
A distinctive number of studies [4], [18], [19], [20] have
been initiated to describe the security and resiliency issues
based on different attack scenarios. These works also describe
the functional operations of smart grid components with guide-
lines for reliable and robust communication among them. They
advise that the energy providers or utilities cannot be trusted
without a proper veriﬁcation that required security measures
have been implemented. Later, McLaughlin et al. [21] analyze
the security and privacy challenges in smart grid networks.
The authors also present an approach for penetration testing
on AMI systems [22]. They develop archetypal and concrete
attack trees for energy fraud, denial of service, and targeted
disconnect attacks. Rahman et al. [23] develop a formal model
based tool for the end-to-end security veriﬁcation of advanced
metering infrastructures in smart grids. However, this group of
works do not analyze various misconﬁguration problems and
security controls on smart electric grid networks.
Wang et al. [24] present an artiﬁcial
intelligence-based
approach for analyzing risks in smart grid networks. However,
in their analysis they do not consider network node, link, or
communication failures or how that can effect the control
procedures. Anwar et al. [25], [26] propose frameworks for
modeling power grids and their control elements using ﬁrst
order logic. These frameworks are only capable of evaluating
power ﬂows and overloading violations in smart grids. Several
research works [6], [27] study false data injection attacks in

of these attacks at which adversaries can bypass the existing
bad data detection algorithm. They consider different scenar-
ios, such as limited access to meters, limited resources to
compromise meters, under arbitrary or speciﬁc targets, assum-
ing that the adversary has complete or incomplete information
about the grid. Rahman et al. in [10], [28] present veriﬁcation
models for various UFDI attacks with respect to attacker’s
constraints and impact objectives. Yuan et al. [29] propose
a variant of this kind of attack, which are known as a load
redistribution attack.
Although the above mentioned research shows how stealthy
attacks can be launched against a control process, namely the
state estimation mechanism, they neither model data deliveries
or secured communications nor resiliency properties of the
system while some physical devices or communication links
are facing cyber attacks or accidental failures. Therefore,
there is still the need for modeling SCADA conﬁgurations
and analyzing the security and resiliency properties. In this
work, we address this need by developing a formal model
for provably analyzing operational consistency, security, and
resiliency in SCADA systems.
VII. CONCLUSION
A smart grid contains a large number of cyber and physical
devices as well as various critical control mechanisms that
exhibit highly dependent conﬁguration parameters leading to
increased potential for security and resiliency vulnerabilities.
In this paper, we present an automated formal framework
for verifying the SCADA resiliency. We focus on security
conﬁgurations, controls, and resiliency requirements that are
important for protecting smart grids in various contingencies.
We create a logic-based veriﬁcation model and use SMT to
solve this model as a constraint satisfaction problem. Our
proposed framework performs static conﬁguration analysis in
order to determine potential threats as violations to the smart
grid security and resiliency requirements. We demonstrate the
framework using a test conﬁguration and show its efﬁcacy.
The scalability evaluation of the framework shows that the
execution time lies within 30 seconds for a SCADA system
with 400 physical devices (IEDs and RTUs). In future, we
would like to consider the automated synthesis of necessary
conﬁgurations for resilient SCADA systems satisfying the
security and resiliency requirements.
