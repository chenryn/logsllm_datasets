**Current behavior**  
When an `async` pipe is present on a component, all component's `@Input` are
triggered whenever the async value is updated.  
This is especially annoying in the case of `@Input` bounds to setters
`@Input() set foo(v){ }`.  
Not sure how this is useful, but I observed the following:  
It seems that the `async` pipe calls `unwrapValue` which increments
`unwrapCounter`, forcing `checkBinding` to return true the first time it's
called, causing `updateProp` to be called.
**Expected behavior**  
Only the `@Input` bound to the `async` pipe should be updated. (At least it
was the case with v2)
