User: We have a python application that checks a directory(C:\sample\folder) every 5 seconds, there's also this external application(.net app) that puts file into that same directory (C:\sample\folder). 
Will there be any conflict when the two application access the same folder at the same time (accidentally)?
Conflicts like : 

the external app wont be able to place a file because the python app is currently walking through that same directory?
Assistant: It should be fine for the external app to create and write to a file. If the Python app is reading a file, the .NET app may not be able to write to it while Python is reading it, without both processes opening the file in a shareable way, however.
Likewise if the Python app is going to start reading the newly-created file, it may either find that it can't do so until the .NET app has finished writing to it, or it may read incomplete data. Again, changes would quite possibly be required to both processes to allow reading at all.
It's worth thoroughly testing all the poosibilities you're concerned about, possibly involving the creation of a "fake" external app which writes to a file very slowly, but opening it in the same way that the real one does.
