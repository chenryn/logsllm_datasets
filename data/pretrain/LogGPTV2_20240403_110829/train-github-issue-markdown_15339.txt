The docs for `Pkg.dir()` say _"In particular,`Pkg.dir(pkg)` returns the path
to the package `pkg`."_ However @tkelman points out in EcoJulia/Phylo.jl#2
that this doesn't happen when `LOAD_PATH` is set. As a result there's no way
of finding the path to a file in an installed package (from outside that
package), which is extremely desirable if, for instance, you want to install a
resource with a package for reference. If this is right, this seems like a bug
as it conflicts with the documented behaviour...
