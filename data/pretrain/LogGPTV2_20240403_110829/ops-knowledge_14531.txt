User: I've seen new cygwin for window contains python3.2 files.
Where is the python3.2.exe file under cygwin on window?  I need it to configure interpreter for Eclipse in window, but I don't see it.
Assistant: Probably in /usr/bin, or in windows as {Cygwin Install directory}\bin. For example: D:\Cygwin\bin\
Ensure that you run python3.2.exe within the Cygwin emulation layer.
