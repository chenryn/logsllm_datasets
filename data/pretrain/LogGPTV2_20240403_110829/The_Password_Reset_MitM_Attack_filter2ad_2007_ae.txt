Snapchat username. Yet,
the attacker can launch targeted
attacks on users whose username is known to the attacker (e.g.,
by applying social engineering techniques [13], [20], [34]).
In Whatsapp, the attacker cannot initiate the phone call
immediately. Whatsapp’s password reset process begins with
an SMS that is sent to phone number that is used in the
is initiated only 5 minutes later,
process. The phone call
if the process has not completed. Although the SMS used
by Whatsapp is also vulnerable (see below), this limits the
effectiveness of the attack. E.g., for attackers that can block
SMS messages, or only for users that will not correlate the
SMS from Whatsapp with the registration to the attacking page
that claims to call him, and to the vulnerable phone call that
will be received later (the attacking page can mention that it
usually takes 5 minutes until the call is received).
Telegram’s password reset process is similar to that of
Whatsapp. However, the phone call is initiated only if the
user does not respond to a message that is sent to him via the
Telegram application or later via SMS.
Non-informative SMS in all of the applications. The
SMS messages of all the applications contain the name of
the application. Yet, none of them contain a warning that
will prevent the user from typing the code in other website.
Following the results of Experiment 2, this puts their users in
risk.
This becomes more critical due to lack of language com-
patibility. The surveyed applications are widely used across
the globe, with many users who use different languages. In
spite of that, except Whatsapp, the messages were sent only
in English, regardless of the language settings or the language
used by users. The lack of language compatibility increases

VII. DEFENSES
This section discusses defenses against the PRMitM attacks
introduced in the previous sections. There are multiple ways
to defend against each of the attacks; some of them can be
implemented in several ways. The evaluation of all the defense
techniques and their different variants deserves a separate
work. The variants of each countermeasure should be eval-
uated in user studies to learn about the optimal conﬁguration
for each of them.
The main scope of this paper is to introduce the attack, and
to provide ﬁrst aid that can block it. Therefore, we mainly
discuss and evaluate two countermeasures, which we believe
can be easily deployed by websites. Both the techniques
force the users to understand that someone asked to reset
the password. Because more efforts are required, it might
be claimed that these mechanisms harm the user experience.
However, we believe that in operations like password reset, it
is completely reasonable to make the users work hard to reset
their password if it signiﬁcantly improves the security.

A. Good Security Questions
Security questions that are not exclusively related to the
website might be vulnerable to PRMitM attacks.
If a website asks many questions that are directly related
to the actions done by the user in that site, they cannot be
forwarded to the user as legitimate security questions for other
websites.
Google is an example of a website that relies on security
questions combined with other parameters such as IP addresses
and originating browser. In addition to general security ques-
tions, Google asks questions about common contacts, user-
deﬁned labels, and the use of multiple Google services.
Nevertheless, it is desirable to avoid relying on security
questions, as they can be bypassed by attackers, especially
if the attacker is related to the victim.
B. Secure Password Reset Using SMS
Section IV showed that some users do not read the entire
SMS messages they receive (Experiment 2). Beyond that,
current SMS messages (Table IV) lack a warning about giving
away the code, and are sometimes missing explanations about
the meaning of the code and the sender. Lack of language
compatibility makes this problem even more serious.
Following our ﬁndings, we believe that a password reset
code should not be sent in a clear text over SMS. Hence, we
designed a link-via-SMS (LVS) password reset procedure, and
evaluate it compared to detailed SMS messages.
1) Link-Via-SMS (LVS) Password Reset: Links for pass-
word reset are used mainly when the password reset is done
via email accounts. Among the websites we surveyed, only
Facebook sends a link to reset the password in addition to the
code.
Sending a detailed SMS message with a long link (instead
of a code) overcomes the limitations of the SMS with the code.
First of all, to exploit such a message, the PRMitM attacker
has to ask the user to copy a link to his website, which is
unusual. Moreover, since the link is long, the attacker cannot
just glimpse at the message. This increases the likelihood that
the victim will notice the rest of the text.
A long link is better than just a long code. The natural user
interaction with links is to press on them. On the other hand,
there is always a chance that a user will just copy the code
without reading the message.
In our implementation of the LVS, the link refers the user
to an interactive page that has an alert about the attempt to
reset the user password.
The user experience might be degraded if the user cannot
access the Internet from her phone. However, we believe that
in such cases, it is reasonable to force the user into typing the
long link into her browser’s address bar.
Another question that should be discussed is whether LVS
increases the risk to other attacks. We believe that the answer
to this question is negative. Following received links in SMS
might be harmful [35], [36], but this has nothing to do with an
SMS that is sent by a service that intends to protect its users.
Attackers might try to impersonate legitimate LVS message
to trick users to follow malicious links; however, they can do
the same also for legit SMS messages (although the original
message do not include a link).
2) LVS Evaluation: Experiment 4 repeats Experiment 2 but
with an LVS instead of the classical SMS with the code.
EXPERIMENT 4: Effectiveness of LVS against PRMitM attack
on Facebook users.
Experiment process. The experiment process was similar
to Experiment 2 with a single change: We sent the participants
an SMS with an LVS message.
The LVS message was: *WARNING* Someone requested
to reset your Facebook password. Press this link to reset your
Facebook password: http://bit.ly/XXXXXXX. DO NOT SHARE
IT!
Ethics. We only veriﬁed that the users indeed have a phone
number related to their account. We did not contact Facebook
to initiate a password reset process for the participants’ ac-
counts.
Participants. 46 volunteer students from our institute that
did not participate in any other experiment or survey.
Results and analysis. All
the participants stopped the
attack; namely, none of them typed the link into the attacking
page. This reinforced our hypothesis, that LVS is indeed a
secure way to reset a password using SMS. This is important
due to the poor results achieved by the classical SMS messages
(see Experiment 2).
C. Secure Password Reset Using Phone Call
Although phone calls were shown to be vulnerable in
Experiment 3, they can be used effectively and securely for
password reset processes. Two elements must hold: (1) the
message must include the sender, the meaning of the code,
and a warning about misuse, and (2) the call must cause the
user to listen and understand the message. For this purpose we
conducted Experiment 5, which is similar to Experiment 3, but
evaluates more detailed and interactive phone call. The results
show that indeed, such a phone call signiﬁcantly improves the
results.
EXPERIMENT 5: Effectiveness of detailed and interactive
phone call against PRMitM attacks.
Experiment process. The experiment process was the same
as Experiment 3. However, instead of initiating a phone call
from Google, we called the users with an (interactive) phone
call. We denote by Xi and Yi randomly chosen numbers such
that Xi (cid:2)= Yi. Pressing Yi always leads to Good bye! Consider
securing your account!. Xi leads to the next sentence.
1) Hello! This is a phone call from Google in order to reset
the password of your Google account. Click X0 if you
expected this call, and Y0 otherwise.
2) Warning! Someone asked to reset your Google password.
I repeat: Someone asked to reset your Google password.
If you did not ask for a password reset code, press Y1;
otherwise, press X1.

3) You are about to get a code to reset your Google account
password. You should never share this code with anyone
else and never type it in other websites. No one from
Google or other legitimate websites will ever ask for
this code. Your code is XXXXXX. Again, your code is
XXXXXX. Good bye.
In each of the choices either Xi or Yi will be read ﬁrst
randomly. For example, in step 1 of some of the calls, instead
of mentioning X0 and then Y0, the following sentence was
read: Click Y0 if you did not expect this call, and X0 otherwise.
Without waiting more than a second for a user to press
something, our phone call lasts about 70 seconds, double that
of Google’s current English phone call.
Ethics. We did not initiate the password reset process for the
participants’ Google accounts and did not save their details.
Participants. 45 volunteer students from our institute that
did not participate in any other experiment.
Results and analysis. None of the participants disclosed
their code, which shows that such a phone call is very effective.
Some users failed to follow the instructions the ﬁrst time.
Namely, they initiated the phone call two or three times until
they realized that they should not use this phone call to get a
code for the experiment website. Although it might occur also
for users who really want to reset their password, we believe
that the users will agree to bear this overhead to enhance their
security.
D. Notiﬁcations
Websites should notify their users about both password reset
requests and upon password change. The notiﬁcation should
be done both by sending an email and by sending an SMS.
This is especially critical when the password reset is done
using the phone, and even more crucial for email services. If
the attacker takes over an email account, he can delete the
received notiﬁcation. Similar to the password reset messages,
the notiﬁcations must be clear.
Among the websites we tested (Tables II and III) that
support password reset using a phone, only Google sends an
SMS notiﬁcation after a password change.
E. Alternative Countermeasures
A secure password reset process can be implemented using
a phone via either SMS or phone call. An additional phone
method implemented by Google relies on applications installed
on the user’s phone. An application can prompt a clear
notiﬁcation and initiate a password reset process that does not
involve any external website. This makes the process immune
to PRMitM attacks.
Another alternative for users who do not have an account is
to rely on the accounts of friends [37]. The user should give
in advance email addresses or phone numbers of x friends. In
the password reset process, each of the friends will get a code.
y ≤ x of the codes are required to reset the password.
VIII. RELATED WORK
In this section we describe both MitM attacks in the applica-
tion layer, and other techniques that can be used to overcome
some of the challenges in the password reset process.
A. Application Level MitM
In the attacks described in this paper, the attacker manipu-
lates the victim into solving challenges raised to the attacker
by websites. Previous work offered similar approach to solve
CAPTCHA challenges. Egele et al. [38] offered to overcome
CAPTCHA challenges prompted by websites by prompting
the same CAPTCHA challenges to visitors of other websites
under the attacker’s control. Similarly, viruses and botnets like
Koobface enforced the users of infected computers to solve
CAPTCHA challenges for them [39].
Lauinger et al. offered to perform MitM attack between
two chatting clients, by opening a chat with each of them, and
forwarding their input text from one chat to the other [40]. That
way, the attacker can automatically launch social engineering
attacks without designing advanced artiﬁcial intelligence bots
[41].
Another form of MitM attacks is man in the browser (MitB)
attacks [42]. In MitB attacks, malware takes over the browser
and acts as a proxy between the user and the web. That way,
the malware can obtain every piece of information typed by the
user. Moreover, the attacker can manipulate operations done
by the user. For example, to change the recipient of ﬁnancial
transactions.
Another approach to gain a MitM capability that includes
manipulation on the user, is to lure the victim to use a router
controlled by the attacker. The most known attack is the evil
twin attack [43], [44]. In the evil twin attack, the attacker
creates a WiFi access point with an innocuous name, possibly
a name of a trusted WiFi access point. The attacker eavesdrops
HTTP connections of victims who connect to his rogue access
point and to launch phishing attacks on them.
Phishing attacks also load content from the websites to
which they impersonate, creating kind of MitM between the
original websites and the clients to be as similar as possible to
the original websites [21]. More than a decade ago, sophisti-
cated phishing attack was used to bypass anti-phishing system
used by Bank of America [22]. In the attack, a login phishing
website acts as a MitM between the user and the login page of
the ﬁnancial institution, forwarding the challenges to the user
and their solutions to the bank. However, this is still a phishing
attack and it is not different from other phishing attacks that
impersonate a login page and imitate the login procedure. The
PRMitM attack shows that such techniques are possible even
without the need of impersonation to other websites, which
is the greatest challenge in phishing attacks. See more on the
difference between phishing and PRMitM attacks in Section
II-B.
Finally, in Section VII-B, we argue that during password
reset process, links should be used instead of codes. The
authors of [45] recommended to use links in registration
process due to similar reasons.

B. Overcoming Password Recovery Challenges
During the password recovery process websites use several
challenges. Some of these challenges were analyzed in previ-
ous work.
it
Although a human attacker can solve CAPTCHA challenges
or use cheap labor [46],
is desirable for the attacker
to automate the process. Many methods were developed to
solve text CATPCHAs [47]–[49]. Beyond the classical optical
character recognition (OCR) algorithms, researcher showed
that attackers can abuse audio CAPTCHAs, which are often
provided alongside classical CAPTCHA challenges to improve
website accessibility [50]. As mentioned above, a MitM attack
in the application layer can be applied to solve CAPTCHA
challenges [38].
Security questions is another mechanism that has been stud-
ied. Previous research showed that many security questions are
weak, either due to guessable responses (low entropy) or due
to answers that are publicly available online [29]–[32]. These
works also discuss ways to choose good security questions.
