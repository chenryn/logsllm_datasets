It seems the index constraint doesn't seem to constrain anymore... if it does,
then I blame it being early in the morning.
Copying the code from Ryan's post here:
    class Customer {
        dummyProperty: string;
    }
    var map: { [email: string]: Customer; } = { };
    map['PI:EMAIL'] = new Customer(); // OK
    map[14] = new Customer(); // Not OK, 14 is not a string -- ACTUALLY, this compiles now
    map['PI:EMAIL'] = 'x'; // Not OK, x is not a customer
Playground
Apologies if this has already been raised, but I couldn't find a duplicate
issue. Maybe this is now by design?
