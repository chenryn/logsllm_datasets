### Title: How to Tame Your Unicorn - Exploring and Exploiting Zero-Click Remote Interfaces of Modern Huawei Smartphones

**Abstract:**

In the past decade, the field of baseband security has made significant strides. Research has uncovered privacy issues in 3GPP protocols, from GSM to LTE, and traditional memory safety vulnerabilities in various chipset implementations. However, much of this research has only scratched the surface. Most published memory corruption bugs have been classic TLV parsing vulnerabilities in Layer 3 GSM, and previous remote exploitation demonstrations have focused on basebands as isolated units, without considering the complex interactions with surrounding hardware.

Our research aims to challenge the status quo by delving into the latest iterations of Huawei's Kirin System-on-Chips (SoCs). Following Pwn2Own 2017, Huawei ceased support for unlocked bootloaders, introduced new firmware encryption for SoC components, and significantly improved code quality in response to a well-known baseband source leak. The most recent Kirin chipsets that have been the subject of published research date back to 2016.

In this presentation, we will share our journey from unlocking the newest generations of Huawei devices to identifying and exploiting bootloader vulnerabilities. We will also discuss the development of a debugger and the reverse engineering of new mitigation improvements in the baseband operating system. Additionally, we will explore a part of the 3GPP stack that has received little attention, presenting our findings on Huawei's implementation and the discovery of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that differ from previously documented baseband memory corruption bugs.

Finally, we will investigate the ways in which the baseband interacts with the rest of the SoC. We will present several vulnerabilities we have discovered, both in software and hardware, and explain how we exploited them to escape the baseband sandbox. Our methods allowed us to take control not only of the Android operating system and the Linux kernel but also of TrustZone, demonstrating the full extent of the potential attack surface.
