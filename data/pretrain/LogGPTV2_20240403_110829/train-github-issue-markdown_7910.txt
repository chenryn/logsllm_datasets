To extract the port from a random port in a Deno.listen is somewhat painful:
        const listener = Deno.listen({ port: 0, transport: "tcp" });
        //@ts-ignore
        const {port} = listener.addr
        this.port = port
While the random port doesn't seem that useful, it is extremely. For unit
tests, launching a listener or process at a random port means that unit tests
can really be independent, and not hardcoded.
