User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to re-order windows, change the scroll shortcut, and modify the status bar contents in GNU Screen? I learned to use gnu-screen and have been using it for the past several weeks. I got a grip of the basics now, and would be very helpful if I get these queries clarified:


How do I rename / reorder / move windows in Linux screen utility?

For eg., after a few days of use, I come to a state where the window-numbers are 2, 3, 6, 8. Now I want a new-window to be created at #9, or #7. Is this possible? If yes, how?

Also, is it possible to 'move' the window #6 to #4 or #7? If yes, how?
Scrolling shortcut: Scroll takes Ctrl-A + Esc, and then Ctrl-u / Ctrl-d. Is there a way to map PgUp / PgDn to do these directly? Or, is there a way to map some key (like F5) to take me to copy mode, and then PgUp / PgDn for scrolling?
I have enabled "caption always", so the current window title is displayed always at the bottom. Is there a way to display the current window's log-file-name and logging status (on/off) in the same caption bar?

Assistant: You can renumber the current window with ctrl+a :number x where x is a numeric argument.

You can rename the current window with ctrl+a A
