I wonder if this challenge is suitable for the large number of campers who
speak english as a second language or if it could be re-worded so that
understanding english sentence structure or the game "madlibs" is no longer
required. I see a disproportionate number of campers unable to even begin this
challenge, asking questions in the gitter chat rooms. If we could distill this
challenge to its programming essence, I believe it would be good.
