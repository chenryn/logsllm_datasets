Typescript says things are duplicate when i move a file around.  
My guess is that the location of the file is not updated in the typescript
service properly because when i restart VSCode it fixes itself but still its
annoying to have to restart the editor.
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. get a large typescript code base like react.d.ts or something similar
  2. move it
  3. watch it happen
