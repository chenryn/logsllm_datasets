I recently installed the 32-bit version of Python on Windows 7 and then proceeded to install the 32-bit version of Eclipse. After successfully adding PyDev to Eclipse, I attempted to set up the Python interpreter by navigating to `PyDev -> Interpreters - Python`, clicking on "New", and browsing to `C:\Python27\python.exe`. However, I encountered an error message:

**Error Message:**
```
Error getting info on interpreter.
Common reasons include:
- Using an unsupported version
- Specifying an invalid interpreter
Reasons:
See error log for details.
```

**Log Details:**
```
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 4; columnNumber: 23; The reference to entity "g" must end with the ';' delimiter.
```

Could you provide any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

I experienced a similar problem in the past, and it turned out that the issue was related to the use of special characters, specifically the ampersand (`&`), in the path to my Eclipse installation folder. To resolve this, I renamed the folder to use only standard alphanumeric characters (e.g., `Eclipse_32bit`). This change ensured that the path statement for the location of the Eclipse folder was strictly Unicode-compliant without any additional or special characters.

After renaming the folder, I was able to install and configure PyDev without encountering the same error. 

I recommend checking your Eclipse installation path for any special characters and renaming the folder if necessary. This should help resolve the issue.
