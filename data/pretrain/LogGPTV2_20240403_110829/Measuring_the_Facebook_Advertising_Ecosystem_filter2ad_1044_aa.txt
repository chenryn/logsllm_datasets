Abstract—The Facebook advertising platform has been subject
to a number of controversies in the past years regarding privacy
violations, lack of transparency, as well as its capacity to be
used by dishonest actors for discrimination or propaganda. In
this study, we aim to provide a better understanding of the
Facebook advertising ecosystem, focusing on how it is being
used by advertisers. We ﬁrst analyze the set of advertisers and
then investigate how those advertisers are targeting users and
customizing ads via the platform. Our analysis is based on the
data we collected from over 600 real-world users via a browser
extension that collects the ads our users receive when they browse
their Facebook timeline, as well as the explanations for why users
received these ads.
Our results reveal that users are targeted by a wide range of
advertisers (e.g., from popular to niche advertisers); that a non-
negligible fraction of advertisers are part of potentially sensitive
categories such as news and politics, health or religion; that a
signiﬁcant number of advertisers employ targeting strategies that
could be either invasive or opaque; and that many advertisers
use a variety of targeting parameters and ad texts. Overall, our
work emphasizes the need for better mechanisms to audit ads
and advertisers in social media and provides an overview of the
platform usage that can help move towards such mechanisms.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The Facebook advertising platform has been the source of
a number of controversies in recent years regarding privacy
violations [31], [40], lack of transparency on how it provides
information to users about the ads they see [22], and lately,
Facebook’s ability to be used by dishonest actors for discrim-
inatory advertising [9], [16], [38] or ad-driven propaganda to
inﬂuence elections [19]. For example, Propublica demonstrated
how Facebook allowed advertisers to reach users associated
with the topic of ‘Jew Haters’ [9], and also allowed advertisers
to exclude people from ads about employment based on their
age [16].
This situation has led many governments and privacy advo-
cates to push Facebook to make its platform more transparent

and more accountable for the ads that circulate on it [13].
However, providing transparency can be tricky for such a
complex system. For example, Andreou et al. [22] recently
showed that current
transparency mechanisms provided by
Facebook that explain why a user has received a particular
ad are incomplete and sometimes misleading. In addition, a
new report from Upturn [17] (supported by many privacy
advocates) argued that Facebook’s ad transparency efforts are
far from sufﬁcient:
Facebook’s ad transparency tools do not
include
an effective way for the public to make sense of
the millions of ads running on its platform at any
given time ... [We recommend to] provide a strong
baseline of access to all ads, not just those identiﬁed
as political in nature ... [and] disclose data about
ads’ reach, type, and audience—especially for ads
that implicate important rights and public policies.
So, despite Facebook’s efforts to provide transparency, little is
known about the ads inside the platform and how the various
targeting features of the platform are used by advertisers.
There exist two primary characteristics of Facebook’s ad-
vertising platform that make transparency both more crucial
and more complex at the same time. First, every user with
a Facebook account can become an advertiser in a matter of
minutes with ﬁve clicks on Facebook’s website; there is no
veriﬁcation required to become an advertiser, and no need to
provide an identity card or proof of a legitimate registered
business. Second,
the platform provides advertisers with a
wide range of ways to target users. For example, advertisers
are able to target users that satisfy precise combinations of
attributes—based on a list of over 200,000 attributes provided
by Facebook—resulting in complex targeting formulas such
as “interested in tennis and having very liberal convictions but
not living in ZIP code 02115” [5]. Alternatively, advertisers
can target speciﬁc users if they know information such as the
user’s email address or phone number (referred to as Personally
Identiﬁable Information or PII; see Section II for more details).
We do not aim to debate whether such targeting strategies
should be allowed in the ﬁrst place, but we do believe that in
order to design better transparency mechanisms, it is necessary
to have an understanding of how they are being used by
advertisers.
In this paper, we provide a detailed look at how the
Facebook advertising ecosystem is being used. To do so, we
ﬁrst study Who are the advertisers? (Section IV) and then
How are the advertisers using the platform? (Section V). We
investigate topics such as the most common targeting strategies
advertisers use, the users who advertisers target the most, and
how advertisers tailor their ads to speciﬁc users. To do so, we
analyze data from 622 real-world Facebook users, based on
two versions of AdAnalyst [4]. In brief, AdAnalyst is a browser
extension that we developed to collect the ads users receive
when they browse their Facebook timeline, as well as the cor-
responding explanations Facebook provides about the reasons
they have been targeted with each particular ad. In total, we
analyze data about 89K/146K ads and 22K/28K advertisers
(see Section III). While our data is unique and provides a
new perspective on the Facebook advertising ecosystem, it
does have biases due to the way we disseminate AdAnalyst,
and limitations due to the incompleteness of ad explanations
provided by Facebook. We provide precise descriptions of how
these limitations impact the results and ﬁndings throughout the
paper.
Our work is the ﬁrst study of ads and advertisers in Face-
book at a moderate scale. While there have been many studies
about online ad targeting [25], [27], [30], [33]–[36], [42], none
focused extensively on social media advertising on Facebook.
This is important because Facebook has the highest ad volume
amongst social media platforms and it offers a wider range
of data and targeting mechanisms than traditional advertising.
Facebook is also often a pioneer in introducing new targeting
mechanisms such as PII-based targeting (see Section II). Addi-
tionally, our study differs from previous works in several other
ways. First, we analyze the ad targeting strategies of a large
number of advertisers on Facebook. Related work on Facebook
[22] has focused on explanations of ad targeting, but it only
performed controlled experiments to evaluate the transparency
mechanisms Facebook provides. We use their results as a basis
to interpret the large-scale datasets of ads and explanations we
collect. Second, we analyze ads collected from real-world users
in contrast to the more traditional techniques for collecting
ads by creating fake personas and visiting a predeﬁned set
of websites to collect the corresponding ads [25]. We believe
our study offers a unique view of the Facebook advertising
ecosystem that will be very useful for subsequent efforts to
increase its transparency.
Our analysis in Section IV of the set of advertisers on
Facebook reveals that the ecosystem is broad and complex.
There exist advertisers that are well-known and popular (i.e.,
having more than 100K Likes, covering 32% of all advertisers)
amongst which over 73% have a veriﬁed account. At the
same time, there exist many advertisers that are niche (i.e.,
have less than 1K Likes, covering 16% of all advertisers) and
whose trustworthiness is difﬁcult to manually/visually assess
(e.g., less than 7% of them are veriﬁed). We also see that a
non-negligible fraction of advertisers are part of potentially
sensitive categories such as News and Politics, Education,
Business and Finance, Medical, Legal and Religion.
Our analysis in Section V of how the advertisers are using
the platform reveals that:
of targeting strategies (20%) are either potentially invasive
(e.g., make use of PII or attributes from third-party data
brokers to target users), or are opaque (e.g., use the Lookalike
audiences feature that lets Facebook decide to whom to send
the ad based on a proprietary algorithm). This represents a shift
from more traditional targeting strategies based on location,
behavior, or re-targeting. Finally, most advertisers (65%) target
users with one single ad, and only a small fraction (3%) target
users persistently over long periods of time.
(2) Users who advertisers target: A signiﬁcant fraction of
advertisers (24%) use multiple attributes to target users, with
some using as many as 105 attributes! While in most cases
the targeting attributes are in accordance with the business
domain of the advertiser, we do ﬁnd cases of questionable
targeting even from large companies, which emphasizes the
need for more visibility and accountability in what type of
users advertisers target.
(3) How advertisers tailor their ads: A surprisingly large
number of advertisers change the content of their ads either
across users (79%1), across targeting attributes (65%1), or
across time (86%1). While this practice is not
inherently
malicious, it requires close monitoring as it could open the
door to manipulation via micro-targeting.
Overall, our analysis points to the fact that users receive ads
that often come from potentially sensitive advertiser categories,
that are targeted using invasive strategies, and whose quality
is difﬁcult
to assess. Our work emphasizes the need for
better mechanisms to audit ads and advertisers, to increase
transparency, and to protect users from dishonest practices. In
particular, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant fraction of Lookalike audience
targeting, for which current
transparency mechanisms are
unsatisfactory; our work therefore points to the necessity of
ﬁnding appropriate transparency mechanisms for this targeting.
Similarly, we ﬁnd that 79% of users have received an ad using
PII-based targeting, pointing to the need to ﬁnd ways of better
explaining how advertisers received this information in the ﬁrst
place [41]. We also ﬁnd that many advertisers run multiple
campaigns with various targeting strategies and/or various ads;
this points to the necessity of adopting a global approach
towards transparency that does not look at ads in isolation.
As a step forward, our AdAnalyst browser extension
provides users with aggregate statistics about who are the
advertisers that target them, and what are the properties of
other users that were targeted by the same advertisers, which
we hope will help users protect themselves from dishonest
practices and gain a better understanding of the ads they
receive. The AdAnalyst extension can be downloaded and run

provides to users.

A. Advertising in Facebook
Becoming a Facebook advertiser is a simple process: to
sign up, one only needs a (personal) Facebook account and
a payment method (e.g., a credit card). In a few clicks, any
user can become an advertiser by simply clicking on “Create
Ads” from dropdown menu. To place an ad, advertisers need
to create a targeting audience where they specify the users
they want to target, choose some optimization criteria, upload
their ad’s text and image, and place a bid [3].
To create a targeting audience, Facebook provides prospec-
tive advertisers with a plethora of options. First, advertisers
can target users based on their age, gender, location, and the
language they speak. Second, advertisers can target users based
on combinations of attributes representing the characteristics
they want users who receive their ads to have (e.g. users inter-
ested in both table tennis and pizza). Targeting attributes are
grouped into high-level categories of demographics, behaviors,
and interests [22]. Interests can either be predeﬁned (where the
advertisers can browse in a tree structure of attributes in order
to target users) or free-text (where the advertisers can type
something they believe is related with their desired targeting
and browse to related attributes).
Third, advertisers can target users via Custom audiences,
where the advertiser selects speciﬁc users. Advertisers can do
so by uploading a list of various types of personally identiﬁable
information (PII), including email addresses, phone numbers,
physical addresses, names, and dates of birth. They can also
create Custom audiences by selecting users who have visited
their third-party website, installed their mobile application, or
‘Liked’ their Facebook Page. Fourth, advertisers can target
users via Lookalike audiences. In brief, advertisers can start
with a Custom audience and ask Facebook to identify other
Facebook users who are similar to (‘lookalike’) users in the
source audience. Facebook does not precisely deﬁne how it
measures similarity, or disclose its algorithm for selecting
users.
Advertisers can also combine different targeting options
together, such as ﬁrst
targeting using a Custom audience
and then further targeting using age, gender and targeting
attributes [14].
information based on your Facebook proﬁle and
where you’ve connected to the internet.
These explanations provide insight into how a user was
targeted. Prior work [22] demonstrated that some explanations
are more informative than others, depending on the way a user
was targeted (see more details in Section III-B).
Another transparency mechanism that Facebook offers is
the Ad Preferences page [3]. There, users can see (some of)
the attributes that Facebook has inferred about them [22].
III. DATASET
In this paper, we use a dataset collected with the help of
AdAnalyst [4]. AdAnalyst is a browser extension available
for Chrome and Firefox that collects three main types of
information as users browse Facebook: (1) the ads users
receive when they browse their Facebook timeline; (2) the
ad explanations provided by Facebook on why they receive a
particular ad, and (3) the Ad Preferences pages of the users. We
deployed AdAnalyst in two different instances; one for broader
worldwide audiences, and one with a focus on Brazilian users.
The Brazilian instance was disseminated as part of a project2
to provide transparency about political campaigns in the 2018
Brazilian elections.
In this study, we look at data collected from both versions
of AdAnalyst. We call the dataset obtained by the version for
broader audiences DATA-WORLDWIDE, and the data obtained
from the version focused on Brazilian users DATA-BRAZIL.
When we do not mention results from DATA-BRAZIL or
combined results explicitly, we will be referring to results from
DATA-WORLDWIDE.
We only use data from users that installed AdAnalyst for
more than one day. In total, we have 114 users in DATA-
WORLDWIDE and 508 in DATA-BRAZIL. DATA-WORLDWIDE
includes data that have been collected over a period of one year
and four months, while DATA-BRAZIL over a period of ﬁve
months. The median number of days for which we have data
for a user is 35 (29 in DATA-BRAZIL). Next, we provide more
details about the data we collect and how we collect it.
B. Facebook’s transparency mechanisms
A. Data collection
Facebook provides explanations to users about why they
have received a speciﬁc ad, we call these ad explanations. To
obtain such explanations users need to click on the “Why am
I seeing this?” button that is in the upper right corner of every
ad. Ad explanations are usually structured in two parts. The
ﬁst part reveals a part of the targeting and looks like:
One reason you’re seeing this ad is that [advertiser]
wants to reach people interested in [attribute], based
on activity such as liking Pages or clicking on ads.
The second part of an explanation reveals attributes that
might have been potentially used by an advertiser:
There may be other reasons you’re seeing this ad,
including that [advertiser] wants to reach people
ages [age range] who live in [location]. This is
Ads: In order to capture the ads that users receive on Facebook,
AdAnalyst inspects the DOM on Facebook pages for the tag
“Sponsored”. This tag is used by Facebook to help users
distinguish sponsored content (i.e., ads) from the other posts in
their Facebook feed. Ads appear either as Facebook posts (i.e.,
front ads), or appear on the right side of the screen (i.e., side
ads). We capture the media content of the ad, the text of the ad,
and the identity of the advertiser. AdAnalyst does not collect
video ads that appear when a user is watching a video on
Facebook. Ads are accompanied by an ad id, which we can use
to identify unique ads. In total, we have collected 88.6K unique
ads in DATA-WORLDWIDE and 145.8K in DATA-BRAZIL. The
median number of unique ads received by a user daily is 11.1
(11.5 in DATA-BRAZIL).
