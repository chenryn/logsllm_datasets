Currently loss functions does not allow weighting each instance differently.
For example, in machine translation, we don't want to calculate losses for PAD
labels. This can be done with cross entropy by specifying label weights, but
can't be done with MSELoss (which is used to train critic/baseline model if we
apply RL to MT). Manually writing a new loss function is possible, but having
this feature is very convenient. The weights are better be per-instance rather
than per-label.
