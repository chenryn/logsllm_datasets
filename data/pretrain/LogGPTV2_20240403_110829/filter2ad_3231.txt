**Abstract:**

In this keynote presentation, Rakesh Agrawal from the IBM Almaden Research Center will discuss the critical role of privacy in the design and implementation of information systems. The talk will explore the concept of "privacy-cognizant" systems, which are designed to protect user data while still providing valuable services. Key topics will include:

- **The Importance of Privacy:** Understanding the significance of privacy in the digital age and the potential risks associated with data breaches and misuse.
- **Privacy by Design:** Principles and best practices for integrating privacy considerations into the development lifecycle of information systems.
- **Technological Solutions:** An overview of current and emerging technologies that can enhance privacy, such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and secure multi-party computation.
- **Case Studies and Applications:** Real-world examples of privacy-cognizant systems and their impact on various industries, including healthcare, finance, and e-commerce.
- **Future Directions:** A look at the future of privacy in information systems and the ongoing challenges and opportunities in the field.

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the importance of privacy in information systems and to offer practical insights for developing more secure and privacy-protective solutions.
