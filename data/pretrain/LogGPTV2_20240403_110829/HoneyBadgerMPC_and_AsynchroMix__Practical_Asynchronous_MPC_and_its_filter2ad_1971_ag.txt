Table 4: Table of Region Setting for AsynchroMix Online
Phase Benchmark (n is the number of peers)
For a better understanding of the network situation among dif-
ferent AWS nodes, we launched tests to measure the latency and
bandwidth among AWS peers in different regions. The result of
latency experiment could be found at Table 5 and we measured it by
letting peers ping each other. With the help of iper f 3, we managed
to measure the per link bandwidth among the peers. The result of
bandwidth experiment is available in Table 6. Besides per link band-
width, we also get total outgoing bandwidth which are measured
when all peers communicate with all other peers. Total outgoing
bandwidth provides a better view of actual communication and
benchmark result is available in Table 7.
B DETAILS ON DISTRIBUTED EXPERIMENT
SETUP
To launch distributed experiments on both Powermix and Swtiching
Network, we set up AWS machines in up to 10 regions across 5
continents around the world. We tested the performance of both
methods in the following settings : n = 4, n = 10, n = 16, n = 50, n =
100 and corresponding region settings are recorded in Table 4.
