User: I am writing an IRC bot in Python. 
I wish to make stand-alone binaries for Linux and Windows of it. And mainly I wish that when the bot initiates, the console window should hide and the user should not be able to see the window.
What can I do for that?
Assistant: just change the file extension from .py to .pyw
