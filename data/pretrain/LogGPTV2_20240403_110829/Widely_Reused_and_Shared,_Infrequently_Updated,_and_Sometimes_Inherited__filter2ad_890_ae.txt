A.2 Semi-structured Interview Questions
Asset Category Independent Questions: Part I
1. Can you please tell us how many unique PINs you cur-
rently use?
2. Which resources do those PINs protect? For ATM
cards, does the PIN protect one or multiple ATM cards?
[Participants were reminded of some assets that are
commonly protected by a PIN. The list included ATM
cards, smartphones, laptops, personal computers, on-
line accounts, electronic home locks, home security
systems, garage door openers, cars, bike/gym locks,
voicemail, gaming consoles, apps, smartwatches, ther-
mostats, and other home devices.]
3. Did you miss any PINs previously? What resources do
they protect?
Asset Category Dependent Questions
The following questions were repeated for each of the three
PIN categories (digital, (cid:27)nancial, and physical). Context-
dependent questions were for the most frequently used PIN
in each category, unless otherwise noted.
1. Who else have you shared this PIN with? If friends or
roommates, how many?
15
Asset Category Independent Questions: Part II
1. Have you ever used the same PIN for two or more
devices? How about devices that are in di(cid:29)erent
classes?
2. Consider a digital device you use to login to your bank-
ing website/app or your digital wallets like Apple Pay
or Google Pay. Is this device protected using a PIN (in-
cluding PIN backup for (cid:27)ngerprint? If so, does access
to your banking website or your digital wallets require
another PIN or a password?
3. How were the physical PINs to home or garage
access were setup?
[Did they set them up? Did
they updated them when they moved to a new
place? Did a technician set them up? Did the pre-
vious owner set them up or is it the default PIN?
If the previous owner set up the garage door PIN,
did they change key locks? If so, why not other PINs?]
2. How concerned would you be if your PIN was re-
vealed to the following people: (5-point Likert scale
“Very concerned”– “Not concerned at all”)
(a) Friends, (b) Roommates, (c) Parents, (d) Siblings, (e)
Spouses, (f) Children
3. How long have you been using this PIN?
4. Have you ever changed a PIN in this category in the
past? If so, what prompted it?
5. [IF CHANGED PIN] What are your strategies for
changing a PIN and picking a new PIN?
6. Can you rank how important the security of this as-
set is you? (5-point Likert scale “Very important”– “Not
important at all”)
7. When picking the PIN, what was the order of impor-
tance for the following criteria: (a) memorability; (b)
ease of usability; (c) security; (d) reuse of a previous
PIN
8. How often do you enter a PIN for this category?
9. (For any asset in this category) Has there ever been
a situation where someone learned your PIN? If so,
who? How did they learn it? What device? What was
your recourse? If the PIN was not updated, why?
10. (For any asset in this category) Have you ever been
in a situation where you were worried about someone
observing your PIN? What was your recourse?
11. (For any asset in this category) Have you ever been
in a situation where you were worried about someone
may try guessing your PIN? What was your recourse?
12. (For any asset in this category) Have you ever shared
a PIN with someone in the past that you are no longer
in a relationship with? If so, who? [Examples include
past spouses, friends, coworkers, and roommates]
13. [IF SHARED WITH PAST RELATIONSHIPS] Did
you take any steps to ensure that such people no
longer have access to your PIN protected resources?
What steps did you take, and why?
14. Have you ever tried to learn or observe a PIN of some-
one? How? Was it successful? What resource were
you trying to access? Was it someone you knew?
15. If we ask you to guess the PIN of a person you know
in (cid:27)ve guesses, what strategies will you take?
16. Would your strategies for the above question change
if it was a stranger?
17. (For any asset in this category) Do you store or write
PINs anywhere, like a notepad or online password
manager? If you write them on a notepad, where do
you store it?
