The following code snippet will cause an error. The issue can be resolved by removing the `req.clone()` call.

```javascript
Deno.serve(opts, (req) => {
    console.log('check req', req.clone());
    return new Response();
});
```

### Error Details:
```
TypeError: Array.prototype.map called on null or undefined
    at map ()
    at cloneInnerRequest (deno:ext/fetch/23_request.js:164:9)
    at Request.clone (deno:ext/fetch/23_request.js:489:18)
    at Object.serve (deno:ext/flash/01_http.js:543:22)
    at async Promise.all (index 0)
    at async Object.serve (deno:ext/flash/01_http.js:619:5)
```

### Explanation:
The `req.clone()` method is causing the error. This suggests that there is an issue with the internal implementation of `clone()` in the Deno runtime, possibly due to a null or undefined value being passed to `Array.prototype.map`.

### Solution:
To fix the error, you can simply remove the `req.clone()` call:

```javascript
Deno.serve(opts, (req) => {
    console.log('check req', req);
    return new Response();
});
```

This should resolve the issue and allow the server to run without errors.
