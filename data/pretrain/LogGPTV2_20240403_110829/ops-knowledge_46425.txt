User: Please list common attack types related to web security, how to prevent and deal with these attacks?
Assistant: Common types of web security attacks include: 1. XSS (cross-site scripting) preventive measures: - Filter and validate user input, especially special characters such as "<", ">", "'", "\"" Etc. - Escaping and filtering the output content, such as escaping "<" to "&lt;", and escaping ">" to "&gt;" - Using cookies marked with HTTPOnly and Secure - Using CSP (Content Security Policy) Strategy to prevent inline scripts and external resource loading Countermeasures: - Update website patches in time to avoid XSS attacks as much as possible - Respond to XSS vulnerability reports in a timely manner and fix website vulnerabilities as soon as possible - Monitor website behavior and analyze user feedback, such as abnormal behavior Timely fix 2. CSRF (Cross-site request forgery attack) preventive measures: - Use Token to verify user identity - Use verification code and secondary confirmation when submitting the form - Limit HTTP Referer to send requests from other websites to this site Countermeasures: - As soon as possible Fix vulnerabilities and update the website in a timely manner - use cookies marked with HTTPOnly and Secure - monitor website behavior, discover and deal with CSRF attack events in time 3. Preventive measures for SQL injection attacks: - use parameterized queries and stored procedures and other safe programming methods - for users Input is filtered and validated, especially special characters such as single quotes, double quotes, comments, etc. - Do not store confidential information in Cookies or URL Countermeasures: - Update website patches in time to avoid SQL injection attacks as much as possible - Safe to use Logging and analysis system, discovering and recording SQL injection events - monitoring database behavior, finding abnormal behavior and repairing in time 4. DDos attack prevention measures: - Build a web application firewall (WAF) - Configure correct DNS server and load balancer - Strengthen hardware defense, such as using DDoS protection equipment Countermeasures: - Notify Internet Service Provider (ISP) in time - Adjust network topology and limit traffic sources - Use firewalls and IP filters to filter malicious traffic 5. File contains vulnerability prevention measures: - Repair and strengthen the function libraries and scripts that include files - Restrict and filter the path of included files - When using the file upload component, filter and verify uploaded files Countermeasures: - Update website patches in time to avoid file uploads as much as possible Occurrence of Inclusion Vulnerabilities - Use code auditing tools to analyze code, find and fix vulnerabilities - Monitor website behavior, and repair found files contain vulnerabilities in time 6. Preventive measures for HTTP header injection attacks: - Filter and verify user input - Prevent client submission, Modify, hide, and delete information in the HTTP request header - apply web server security patches, and update the web server software in a timely manner Countermeasures: - detect HTTP header injection attacks, find abnormal behaviors and repair them in time - pay attention to checking sensitive and important data in the HTTP header , when abnormal data is found, use security tools to monitor in real time. And on the basis of perfection, the security of web applications can be ensured.
