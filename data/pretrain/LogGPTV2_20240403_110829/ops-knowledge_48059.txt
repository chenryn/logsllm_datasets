User: I'm using PortableApps application with portable eclipse and portable python installed. I've equipped my eclipse with PyDev plugin enabling me to run and debug my files on whatever windows-based platform I'd like. The problem is in order to use the interpreter inside my USB stick, I need to address the proper location of the python interpreter in PyDev settings. with USB drive connected to different computers, I get different drive letter for my USB stick which would make problem locating the path of the installed python inside my USB stick.
