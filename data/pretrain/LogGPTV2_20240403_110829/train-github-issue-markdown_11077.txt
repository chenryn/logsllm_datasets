Greetings, We have a spring app, which listens to messages from a weblogic
JMS. we are using weblogic client library 10.0.1, and Spring 3.0.3-Release. We
use transaction'ed JMS sessions.
It could possibly be a dup of https://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-7366
Can someone pls have a look at the stack trace of JMS Listener threads and
comment? Your help will be much appreciated.
Also adding my spring configuration below:
    		${MNSClient.receive.jms.user}
    		${MNSClient.receive.jms.password}
    		${MNSClient.receive.jms.connectionFactoryName}
    			${MNSClient.receive.jms.initialFactoryName}
    			${MNSClient.receive.jms.providerUrl}
    		${MNSClient.receive.jms.queueName}
