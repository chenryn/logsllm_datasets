This is a regression from 0.6.2 which affects DataFramesMeta
(JuliaData/DataFramesMeta.jl#88). Under some very particular circumstances,
expression interpolation reverses the order of keys in a dictionary, compared
with the order obtained in other places inside the same function. This is a
problem when the function relies on the order of keys matching that of values
(as with DataFrames macros).
In the following example, `:a` appears before `:b` in the two first lines
inside the quoted block, but that's the contrary for the third line.
    function with_helper()
        membernames = Dict{Symbol,Int}(:a => 1, :b => 2)
        quote
            $(keys(membernames)...)
            $(map(key -> :($key), keys(membernames))...)
            $(map(key -> :(somedict[$key]), keys(membernames))...)
        end
    end
    julia> with_helper()
    quote
        #= REPL[1]:4 =#
        a
        b
        #= REPL[1]:5 =#
        a
        b
        #= REPL[1]:6 =#
        somedict[b]
        somedict[a]
    end
