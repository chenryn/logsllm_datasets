is the length of an AS_PATH. Note that
to verify a received route update in these schemes, the time of
signature veriﬁcation is super-linear to the length of AS_PATH.
PATH only requires one public key signature veriﬁcation, there-
fore has similar convergence performance as TBGP.
where
Fig. 9 shows the impact of TBGP on message size and
memory costs with 110 ASes topology. The baseline of average
announcement message and memory cost in our experiment
is 36.09 bytes and 9 KB [20], respectively. On average, the
message size increase in SBGP is more than 763% and that in
TBGP is only about 96%. Compared to S-A, SAS, and PATH,
TBGP still achieves much better performance. For example,
the average message size of BGP updates in PATH is 34
times larger than that in TBGP since PATH needs to generate
and piggyback tree-based authentication proofs in updates.
Furthermore, TBGP has signiﬁcant improvement in memory
consumption. As illustrated, the SBGP scheme consumes addi-
tional 1140% of memory to cache routes and their signatures,
but TBGP only requires about 1.1 times more memory to cache
routes and has a 9.26 times improvement over sBGP. Similarly,
memory consumption in S-A, SAS, and PATH is more than
130% larger than that in TBGP. The reason behind the low cost
is that TBGP does not require caching received route signatures
for further propagation thus eliminates the storage complexity
of
in SBGP.
VI. DISCUSSION
Key Distribution: The prototype of TBGP adopts IBS and
then relaxes the centralization requirement of authorities be-
cause different preﬁx/AS assignment organizations can generate
private keys independently. It does not require additional infra-
structure and mechanism to manage and distribute certiﬁcates.
These authorities are only authorized to generate and bind pri-
vate keys with preﬁxes/ASes which they are authorized to as-
sign. Before that, PKG services provided by these authorities

BGP. Compared to 200% extra convergence time of SBGP, it introduces very
small convergence overhead.
attestation overhead in each AS includes both IN and OUT
ﬁlter attestations. We evaluate the routing convergence time of
our simulation, which considers all the overhead introduced in
TBGP route computation and selection and is frequently used
to evaluate computation overhead in literature. Fig. 7 shows
the impact of TBGP on convergence time, compared with the
ordinary BGP. In these four different topologies, TBGP has
7%, 10%, 4%, and 0% extra convergence time compared to
ordinary BGP, respectively. Especially, TBGP does not intro-
duce extra convergence delay in large-scale topologies, such
as the 208 ASes topology, because the MRAI timer [1] of 30 s
becomes the major cause of convergence delay. Compared with
SBGP, whose convergence time is over 200% larger than that in
ordinary BGP [20], TBGP achieves much better performance.
Fig. 8 shows the impact of TBGP on the increase ratio of
convergence time with the 110 ASes topology. TBGP only in-
creases 4% convergence delay and achieves much better routing
performance over SBGP and other variants of SBGP. For in-
stance, the convergence performance in SBGP increases over
two times of convergence delay, S-A introduces 9% extra con-
vergence delay, and SAS increases over three times at the cost
of increased memory consumption. Compared to SBGP, S-A,
SAS, TBGP has 56.5, 1.25, and 75 times improvements in con-
vergence time, respectively. The performance result is rational

This can be handled by key request and regeneration. 2) The
keys are compromised. This case happens in TBGP when the
TPM is compromised. If the router OS or BGP logic is compro-
mised, private keys cannot be unsealed by the TPM. For attacks
on TPM, we only require a TPM interact with some well known
address authorities when the router ﬁrstly accesses to Internet.
Thus, the attack interface of the Parno attack [44] is limited.
Moreover, since the Tarnovsky attack [45] requires physical ac-
cess to TPM, we do not consider this issue in this paper.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose TBGP, a lightweight secure BGP
solution to prevent BGP routing attacks. In TBGP, a set of route
attestation rules is strictly enforced in each router to simplify
route attestations and build a trusted Internet routing infrastruc-
ture, and thus aggregated signatures are eliminated without sac-
riﬁcing the security of BGP. Our prototype leverages the trusted
computing (TC) technology to build transitive trust relation-
ships between BGP speakers, and the identity-based signature
(IBS) algorithm to sign/verify BGP routes and reduce the com-
plexity of security operations in existing secure BGP solutions.
Our security analysis and performance study shows that TBGP
meets the security goals of BGP with signiﬁcantly better con-
vergence performance and lower resource cost than traditional
solutions.

Fig. 9. Overhead introduced by TBGP is much lower than other schemes.
TBGP only introduces 96% of increase in update message size and requires
about 1.1 times more memory to cache routes. Compared to SBGP, S-A, SAS
and PATH, TBGP has 24.38, 95.41, 12.28, and 34.09 times improvements in
message size, and 9.26, 30.32, 10.25 and 2.63 times improvements in memory

only need to negotiate to obtain IBS security parameters, such
as same master keys, and then build a ﬂat infrastructure in a se-
cure way [16]. Actually, we can further relax the implication.
Since TBGP builds transitive trust in the Internet by authenti-
cating and attesting neighbor ASes, we can deploy local regional
PKG services to generate different AS number keys. Different
ASes can authenticate and attest to each other and build local
trust chains if their IBS parameters are assigned by the same
regional services, and only some large ASes (or top-tier ASes)
are required to achieve different parameters from different re-
gional services to bridge the trust chains. Thus, we only require
the global authorities, IANA and the regional Internet registries,
such as AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE NCC, to
bind keys with preﬁxes. The approach is similar to what have
been done in Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for
BGP security [39]. For the sake of simplicity, we do not consider
the preﬁx hierarchy in this paper, but assume the centralized
PKGs distribute keys when a router goes online. To realize a
decentralized key distribution, we can leverage the hierarchical
IBS [40], where the public key (identity) is a hierarchical preﬁx,
and then local/domain-level PKGs can be introduced.
Key Refreshment: It is well known that IBS algorithms have
a difﬁcult problem on key revocation. Although key-insulated
systems can solve such a problem [41], they introduce more
computation overhead on routers. We solve the problem from
the view of BGP operations. In TBGP, private keys are under
strong protection, which means a route can achieve correct sig-
nature only if the router platform is not compromised. If the
router is misconﬁgured by its operator, the route also cannot
obtain correct signatures because it cannot be attested by the
trusted routing service. (Moreover, in TBGP, we propose to use
ephemeral public identities, where the public keys can be gen-
erated by including timestamp with identity depending on gran-
ularity.) The private key is then updated periodically in a auto-
matic way. This approach is suggested in original IBE algorithm
[42] and is successfully implemented in commercial products
[43]. In general, there are two cases for key revocation in TBGP:
1) The router role is changed, e.g., preﬁx owner is changed.
