### Summary of SSH Login Attempts and Authentication Failures

**Date: December 10, 2023**

The following log entries document multiple failed SSH login attempts and potential security incidents on the server `LabSZ`. The logs indicate that several IP addresses attempted to access the server using invalid usernames and incorrect passwords. 

#### Detailed Log Entries:

1. **Attempt from 173.234.31.186 (ns.marryaldkfaczcz.com)**
   - **Time:** 06:55:46
   - **User:** webmaster
   - **Status:** Reverse DNS lookup failed, invalid user, authentication failure.
   - **Action:** Connection closed by the client.

2. **Attempt from 212.47.254.145**
   - **Time:** 07:02:47
   - **Status:** Connection closed by the client before authentication.

3. **Attempt from 52.80.34.196 (ec2-52-80-34-196.cn-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com.cn)**
   - **Time:** 07:07:38
   - **User:** test9
   - **Status:** Invalid user, authentication failure.
   - **Action:** Client disconnected with a "Bye Bye" message.

4. **Attempt from 173.234.31.186 (ns.marryaldkfaczcz.com)**
   - **Time:** 07:08:28
   - **User:** webmaster
   - **Status:** Reverse DNS lookup failed, invalid user, authentication failure.
   - **Action:** Connection closed by the client.

5. **Attempt from 202.100.179.208**
   - **Time:** 07:11:42
   - **User:** chen
   - **Status:** Invalid user, authentication failure.
   - **Action:** Client disconnected with a "Bye Bye" message.

6. **Attempt from 5.36.59.76.dynamic-dsl-ip.omantel.net.om**
   - **Time:** 07:13:31
   - **User:** root
   - **Status:** Multiple authentication failures (6 attempts).
   - **Action:** Disconnected due to too many authentication failures.

7. **Multiple Attempts from 112.95.230.3**
   - **Time:** 07:27:50 to 07:28:35
   - **Users:** root, pgadmin, utsims
   - **Status:** Multiple authentication failures for each user.
   - **Action:** Clients disconnected with a "Bye Bye" message after each failed attempt.

### Analysis:
- **Potential Security Threats:**
  - The repeated failed login attempts, especially for the `root` user, suggest a possible brute-force attack.
  - The reverse DNS lookup failures and the use of invalid usernames (e.g., `webmaster`, `test9`, `chen`, `pgadmin`, `utsims`) indicate that these may be automated attempts to gain unauthorized access.
  
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Implement rate limiting or fail2ban to block IP addresses after a certain number of failed login attempts.
  - Ensure that all users have strong, unique passwords and consider using multi-factor authentication.
  - Regularly review and update the list of allowed SSH users and disable unused accounts.
  - Monitor and analyze logs for any suspicious activity and take appropriate actions to secure the server.

This summary provides a clear and structured overview of the security events and suggests actionable steps to mitigate potential threats.
