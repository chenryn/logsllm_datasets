Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of establishing a connection between a client and a server. The log begins with an end of stream exception being caught, followed by a client attempting to establish a new session. The session is then established with a negotiated timeout, and a connection request from an old client is dropped. The client is then revalidated, and the purge interval and max session timeout are set. A connection request from another old client is dropped, and a new socket connection is accepted from a client attempting to renew a session. An end of stream exception is caught, and a socket connection is closed for a client with a specific session ID. A new session is established with a negotiated timeout, and a quorum of supporters is established with a last processed zxid.
