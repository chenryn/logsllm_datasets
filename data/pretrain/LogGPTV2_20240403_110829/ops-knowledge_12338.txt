User: (Python2.7-3.2 on WindowsXP)
I used to use sys.arg[0], but now I'm executing it from a batch script(for determining if the user has python)
Thanks ^^
~ps: Suggest if you know a better way to find out if the user has Python
Assistant: You can read the variable __file__ to find out the path to the current Python file being interpreted.
