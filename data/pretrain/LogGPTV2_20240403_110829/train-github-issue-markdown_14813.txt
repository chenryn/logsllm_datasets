### Current Behavior

When using the validation provided by the `type` attribute on an `<input>` element (e.g., `type="email"`), Angular 2 does not correctly apply the `ng-invalid` class when the browser determines that the input is invalid.

### Expected Behavior

The `ng-invalid` and `ng-valid` classes should be appropriately added based on whether the user's input matches the pattern defined by the HTML5 `type` attribute. This would ensure that the form validation state is accurately reflected in the UI.

### Minimal Reproduction with Instructions

Please provide a minimal example and step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue. This will help us understand and address the problem more effectively.

### Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior

Using the `type` attributes provided by HTML5 for validating user input is considered a best practice. It ensures that the input is validated before submission, providing a better user experience and reducing the risk of invalid data being processed.
