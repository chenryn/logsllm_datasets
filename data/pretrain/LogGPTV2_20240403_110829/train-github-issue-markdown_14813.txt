**Current behavior**
When using validation offered by the type attribute on an input element, such
as , Angular 2 does not add the proper ng-invalid class when the browser sees
the input as invalid.
**Expected behavior**
ng-invalid and ng-valid classes should be added appropriately when a user's
input does not match the pattern defined by HTML5 type attribute.  
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
I believe it is best practice now to use type attributes offered by HTML5 to
validate user input before submission.
