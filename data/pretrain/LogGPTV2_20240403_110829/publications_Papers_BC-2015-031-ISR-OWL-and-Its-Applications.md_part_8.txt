 Examples include semantic wikis, semantic social net-
 works, semantic blogs, and semantic product descrip-
 tions. One particularly interesting application was the
 use of semantics to develop the language called Linked
 USDL (Unified Service Description Language) (Car-
 doso et al., 2012) which enables to describe services
 (e.g. from healthcare, education, and cloud computing).
 It was the emergence of services in society that trig-
 gered the development of the language to automate,
 improve, and support the delivery of digital services.
 It embraces the use of formal ontology representations
to capture the semantics of services in such a way that
they are amenable for automated reasoning.
Linked USDL was developed for describing busi-
 ness, software, or real world services using computer-
readable and computer-understandable ontologies to
make services tradable on the Internet. It provides a

burden of writing the complex syntax of OWL allowing
the user to create and edit ontologies in a visual manner.
Given the logical statement nature of the knowl-
edge represented with ontologies, traditional relational
databases are not the ideal storage and query platform
for OWL, and indeed RDFS. Knowledge in OWL is
represented as sets of 
triples and these are most efficiently stored and ac-
cessed in dedicated triple stores, such as Jena TDB
(Jena TDB 2013), and AllegroGraph (AllegroGraph,
2013). Likewise, querying of triple stores is done via
specific query languages: the current standard language
for querying RDF(S) is SPARQL (SPARQL 1.1, 2013),
and this is also the current standard for querying OWL,
although SPARQL cannot take full advantage of the
expressivity of OWL. Other languages, like SQWRL
(SQWRL, 2013), have been recently proposed for
querying OWL. SWQRL takes advantage of OWL’s
expressive power and also of semantic web rule-based
languages such as SWRL (SWRL, 2004), but is not
yet a standard.
