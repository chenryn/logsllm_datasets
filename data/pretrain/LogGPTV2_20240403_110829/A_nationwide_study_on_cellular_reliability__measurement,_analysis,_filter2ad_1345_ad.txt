experiences. To tackle the problem, when a Data_Stall event is de-
tected, Android launches the three-stage progressive mechanism
that sequentially tries light (cleaning up and restarting the current
connection), moderate (re-registering into the network), and heavy
(restarting the radio component) recovery techniques. Before carry-
ing out each of the above operations, Android would wait for one
minute to watch whether the problem has already been Ô¨Åxed (by
constantly examining whether Data_Stall still exists).
In practice, we observe that this mechanism is quite effective‚Äî
once executed, even the Ô¨Årst-stage, lightweight operation (clean-
ing up the current connection) can Ô¨Åx the problem in 75% cases.
Nevertheless, our measurement shows that this mechanism is overly
conservative and thus rather time-consuming. In fact, for the majority
of Data_Stall events, the user device can automatically recover them
in less time, as illustrated in Figure 10. For example, 60% Data_Stall
failures are automatically Ô¨Åxed in just 10 seconds. Also, we notice
that the victim user would manually reset the data connection within
‚àº30 seconds (according to our sampling user survey). Therefore,
the one-minute ‚Äúprobation‚Äù adopted by Android is unnecessarily
long, rendering the recovery mechanism to be neither efÔ¨Åcient nor
user-friendly in practice.
3.3 ISP and Base Station Landscape
As mentioned in ¬ß3.1, our measurement captures a total of 2.32
billion cellular failure events with regard to 5.3M BSes. In this part,
we look at cellular failures from the viewpoint of ISPs and BSes,
by considering the geographic locations, ISP discrepancies, radio
access technologies, and signal strengths.
Geographic Location. By ranking the involved BSes with their
experienced number of cellular failures (in descending order), we
observe a Zipf-like [60] skewed distribution as depicted in Figure 11
(where ùëé = 0.82 and ùëè = 17.12). The median and average numbers
are 1 and 444 respectively, while the maximum number reaches
8,941,860. We then delve into the 10,000 top ranking BSes, and Ô¨Ånd
that they are mostly located in crowded urban areas. Hence, they are
confronted with essentially more ambient interferences and heavier
cellular access workloads, both of which aggravate the problems.
ISP Discrepancy. The BSes involved in our study belong to three
mobile ISPs, referred to as ISP-A, ISP-B, and ISP-C. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
44.8%, 29.4%, and 25.8% BSes belong to ISP-A, ISP-B, and ISP-C,
respectively. From Figure 12, we can see that cellular failures occur
more prevalently (27.1%) on ISP-B‚Äôs users than on ISP-A‚Äôs (20.1%)
and ISP-C‚Äôs (14.7%), mainly due to the inferior signal coverage of
ISP-B‚Äôs BSes. In detail, while ISP-B‚Äôs BSes are a bit more than
ISP-C‚Äôs, to our knowledge most of ISP-B‚Äôs BSes have a smaller
signal coverage because they usually use a higher radio frequency.
The situation is similar in terms of frequency, as shown in Figure 13.
Radio Access Technology (RAT). Among the involved BSes,
23.4%, 10.2%, 65.2%, and 7.3% support 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G access,
respectively. Here the four percentages add up to more than 100%
because some BSes simultaneously support multiple RATs. While

both the number and overall signal coverage of 3G BSes are smaller
than those of 2G or 4G BSes, we observe that the prevalence of
cellular failures on 3G BSes is lower than that on 2G or 4G BSes,
as indicated in Figure 14. This is probably because 3G access is
usually not favored by user devices when 4G access is available, and
the signal coverage of 3G is much worse than that of 2G when 4G
access is unavailable. In other words, 3G networks currently face
less resource contention from the users (i.e., relatively ‚Äúidle‚Äù) and
thus manifest fewer cellular failures.
In common sense, RSS is a key
Received Signal Strength (RSS).
factor that impacts the reliability of cellular service, and a higher
RSS level (or simply signal level) is usually expected to come with
better service reliability. However, our measurement results in Fig-
ure 15 refute this common understanding by revealing that excellent
RSS seems to increase the likelihood of cellular failures. As the
signal level increases from 0 (the worst) to 4 (good), the normalized
prevalence of cellular failures monotonously decreases. Here the
‚Äúnormalized‚Äù prevalence denotes the regular prevalence (as explained
and computed in Table 1) divided by the total time during which
the device is connected to a BS. We have to use the normalized
prevalence because the durations of different signal levels can differ
greatly from each other; in order to account for this discrepancy,
we divide each prevalence by its average duration to achieve a fair
comparison (the duration data are also provided by Xiaomi based
on a nationwide measurement). On the other hand, when the signal
level goes to 5 (excellent), the normalized prevalence of cellular
failures suddenly grows to larger than each case of level 1 to 4.
To demystify this counter-intuitive phenomenon, we carefully ex-
amine a series of in-situ information corresponding to such excellent-
RSS cellular failures, including the BS location, serving ISP, RAT,
error code, etc.. As a result, we Ô¨Ånd that this phenomenon usually
happens around public transport hubs, where the nearby BSes tend
to be problematic simultaneously, regardless of the serving ISPs
and RATs. Actually, ISPs often choose to densely deploy their BSes
around a public transport hub so as to better cope with the large vol-
ume of human trafÔ¨Åc. Owing to this special BS deployment strategy,
the nearby user devices can typically have excellent (level 5) RSS.
On the other hand, such densely deployed BSes could bring non-
trivial signal interferences to each other [45]. In fact, the three ISPs‚Äô
radio frequency bands are fairly close to each other (more speciÔ¨Å-
cally, with the median frequency being ISP-B‚Äôs > ISP-C‚Äôs > ISP-A‚Äôs)
and even occasionally overlap one another, thus leading to poten-
tially signiÔ¨Åcant adjacent-channel interference. More importantly,
dense BS deployment could make LTE mobility management highly
complicated and challenging [12, 38], causing frequent cellular fail-
ures tagged with EMM_ACCESS_BARRED, INVALID_EMM_STATE,
etc. [3]. This is especially the case when multiple ISPs adopt similar
deployment strategies without coordinations.
4 ENHANCEMENTS
Our multifold Ô¨Åndings on cellular data connections failures in ¬ß3
drive us to rethink the current techniques widely employed by cell
phones, mobile OSes, and ISPs with respect to their inÔ¨Çuence on the
reliability of cellular connections. Accordingly, in this section we
provide insightful guidance for addressing various cellular failures at
scale (¬ß4.1), as well as practical enhancements that have registered
large-scale deployment and yielded real-world impact (¬ß4.2).
4.1 Guidelines in Principle
In ¬ß3 we have revealed a variety of technical and business issues that
could lead to or aggravate cellular failures. As elucidated in ¬ß3.2,
cellular failures on 5G phones are more prevalent and frequent than
the other phones (without 5G capability), most probably owing to the
high network workload and immature production state of today‚Äôs 5G
communication modules. Thus, we suggest that mobile phone ven-
dors be cautious when incorporating 5G modules to their products;
more speciÔ¨Åcally, we encourage the vendors to comprehensively
validate the new 5G modules‚Äô coordination and compatibility with
existing hardware/software, so as to produce more reliable phone
models in terms of cellular communication.
Also in ¬ß3.2, we note that Android 10 phones are more subject to
cellular failures than Android 9 phones, due to the typically worse
stability and robustness of newly released OSes, in particular the
blindly prioritized usage of 5G connection over 4G/3G/2G connec-
tions. We have reported the discovered problems of Android 10
to its ofÔ¨Åcial development team, but have not got useful feedback.
Hence, we propose that for the vendors, sufÔ¨Åcient testing for new
characteristics (e.g., the 4G/5G switching policy) should be carried
out before pushing a new OS to certain phone models.
