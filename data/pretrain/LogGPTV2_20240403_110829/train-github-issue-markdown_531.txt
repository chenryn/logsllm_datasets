### Apache Airflow version
2.5.0
### What happened
Prior to Azure provider 5.0.0, `WasbHook.get_file` only required three
arguments (`file_path`, `container_name`, and `blob_name`), but now two
additional parameters - `length` and `offset` \- are required by the
underlying `WasbHook.download` method. However the underlying
`BlobClient.download_blob` method has `length` and `offset` as optional.
### What you think should happen instead
`length` and `offset` should continue to be optional in `WasbHook.download`
(and therefore `WasbHook.get_file`).
### How to reproduce
Call `WasbHook.get_file` with only the initial three arguments (`file_path`,
`container_name`, and `blob_name`).
