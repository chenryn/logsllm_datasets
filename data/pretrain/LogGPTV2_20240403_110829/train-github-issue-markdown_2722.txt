### Documentation Inaccuracy and Discussion on `scale_C`

I would like to address the issue of "documentation inaccuracy" and the ongoing discussion regarding the `scale_C` parameter before the next release. However, I am currently constrained by time.

As I understand it, using the `C` parameter with `scale_C=True` is not ideal, as it does not align with how `C` is typically used in the literature and other software. I am unsure if we have reached a consensus on a solution yet.

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Duplicate Parameter**:
   - **Pros**: Introduce a new parameter `C` (with `scale_C=False` semantics) alongside the existing `alpha`, which would behave as in other linear models.
   - **Cons**: This could lead to confusion for users who are accustomed to a single `C` or `alpha` parameter.

2. **Single `alpha` Parameter**:
   - **Pros**: Simplifies the API and aligns with the conventions in the literature and other software.
   - **Cons**: This would be a breaking change and might require significant updates to existing code.

### Additional Suggestions

I welcome any other suggestions or ideas that could help us resolve this issue.

### Analysis Script

To better understand the effect of `scale_C`, I created the following script: [Link to Gist](https://gist.github.com/2354823).

The results from the script are as follows:

- **`scale_C=True`**:
  ![true](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ecb5d47a0be5d6b6ab4c33dbe14435b49b1116ebf43b21550328d836f6f1602b/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f366d4b31712e706e67)

- **`scale_C=False`**:
  ![false](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7a4d6fa96dd71543182085a34ec0ac41d97752ee212e6371618aaa2304b429ca/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f474156694e2e706e67)

These images show the results of grid searches for `C=2^k` with "shuffle & split" and different fractions of training data. Theoretically, the results should be shifted by a factor of `n_samples`. Since `n_samples` is not a power of two, the shift is not exact, making the comparison slightly more complex.

### Conclusion

I am not particularly partial to either approach based on the current results. Any further insights or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
