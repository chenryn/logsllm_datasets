The animal on the cover of Jenkins: The Definitive Guide is an ornate chorus frog (Pseudacris ornata).
These small amphibians, only 1–1.5 inches long, can be found on the coastal plains of North America
from North Carolina to central Florida and eastern Louisiana. They prefer areas of shallow water without
dense vegetation, such as ponds, roadside ditches, and flooded meadows.
The coloration of ornate chorus frogs varies depending on locale, and individuals can be predominantly
black, white, brown, red, green, or some variation thereof. All specimens, though, display a dark stripe
or collection of spots running from the nostril to the shoulder through the eye, and most have various
other spots or stripes as well. The species breeds from November to March, and the calls of males can
be heard from in or near areas of shallow water.
Ornate chorus frogs also owe their name to the sound of their mating call: Pseudacris comes from the
ancient Greek for “false locust.” The name was assigned in 1836 by American naturalist John Edwards
Holbrook after he observed that the rapid shrill sound resembled that made by the infamous insect.
