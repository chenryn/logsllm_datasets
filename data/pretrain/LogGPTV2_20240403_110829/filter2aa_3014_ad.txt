### Configuring Port Number for a Website
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **Sites** pane, double-click the site you want to configure.
4. In the **General** pane, enter the port number in the **Port** field.
5. Click **Save**.
   - The web service will restart automatically.

### Improving Performance of Static Websites (Performance Cache)
If your website contains mostly static HTML files and you expect high traffic, enabling the performance cache can significantly improve server performance. The performance cache is enabled by default.

#### When to Disable the Performance Cache:
- If you do not anticipate heavy usage of your website.
- If most of the pages on your website are dynamically generated.

#### Understanding the Effect of Using a Web Service Performance Cache
The web service's performance cache is enabled by default and can significantly enhance performance for websites with mostly static content. Content is cached in system RAM, allowing for quick access in response to client requests.

However, enabling the performance cache does not always improve performance:
- If the amount of static web content exceeds the physical RAM, it can increase memory swapping, degrading performance.
- If other services, such as AFP, compete for physical RAM, the web performance cache may be less effective or impact the performance of those services.

#### Enabling or Disabling the Performance Cache
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **Sites** pane, double-click the site you want to configure.
4. In the **Options** pane, toggle the **Performance Cache** option.
5. Click **Save**.
   - The web service will restart automatically.

You can also improve server performance by disabling the access log.

### Enabling Access and Error Logs for a Website
Enabling logs can help with troubleshooting but may slow down server performance.

#### To Enable Access and Error Logs
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **Sites** pane, double-click the site you want to configure.
4. In the **Logging** pane, check **Enable Access Log** to enable this log.
5. Set the frequency for log archiving by checking the box and entering the number of days.
6. Enter the path to the folder where you want to store the logs, or use the **Browse** button to locate the folder.
   - Note: If you are administering a remote server, file service must be running on the remote server to use the **Browse** button.
7. Choose a log format from the **Format** pop-up menu.
8. Edit the format string if necessary.
9. Configure the error log settings as desired.
10. Click **Save**.
    - The web service will restart automatically.

### Understanding the New Web Service `access_log` Format
In version 10.3 of Mac OS X Server, the web performance cache no longer prevents a remote client's IP address from being logged in the `access_log`. The web performance cache process adds an HTTP header named `PC-Remote-Addr` that contains the client's IP address before passing the request to the Apache web server.

- With the performance cache disabled, the standard log format string remains the same: `%h %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b`.
- With the performance cache enabled, the log format string needs to be modified to extract the remote client's IP address: `%{PC-Remote-Addr}i %l %u %t "%r" %>s %b`.

When you use Server Admin to enable or disable the web performance cache, the `CustomLog` directive in `httpd.conf` is adjusted automatically to ensure the correct remote client address is logged.

### Setting Up Directory Listing for a Website
When users specify the URL for a directory, you can display either a default webpage (e.g., `index.html`) or a list of the directory contents.

#### To Enable Indexing for a Website
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **Sites** pane, double-click the site you want to configure.
4. In the **Options** pane, select **Folder Listing**.
5. Click **Save**.
   - The web service will restart automatically.

Note: Folder listings are displayed only if no default document is found.

### Creating Indexes for Searching Website Content
Version 10.3 of Mac OS X Server continues to support the `mod_sherlock_apple` Apache module, which allows web browsers to search the content of your website. You must create a content index before searching is possible.

#### To Create a Content Index
1. Select the folder containing the files you want to index.
2. Open the **Info** window (File > Get Info).
3. Click **Content Index** and then **Index Now**.
   - You can remove an index using the **Delete Index** button in the **Info** window.

New constraints restrict the creation of index files. You must be the owner of the folder and any files within it. For content in `/Library/WebServer/Documents`, you must be logged in as root to create an index.

For remote or headless servers, use the `indexfolder` command-line tool. See the man pages for usage details. The operation of `indexfolder` is affected by the login window. If no one is logged in, the tool must be run as root. If an administrator is logged in, the tool must be run as that administrator.

Whether done from the Finder or the `indexfolder` tool, content indexing creates a folder named `.FBCIndex` in the folder to be indexed or in one of its parent folders.

### Connecting to Your Website
After configuring your website, it’s a good idea to view it with a web browser to verify that everything appears as intended.

#### To Verify a Website
1. Open a web browser and type the web address of your server.
   - Use either the IP address or the DNS name of the server.
2. Enter the port number if you are not using the default port.
3. If you have restricted access to specific users, enter a valid username and password.

### Enabling WebDAV on Websites
WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) allows you or your users to make changes to websites while they are running. If you enable WebDAV, you also need to assign access privileges for the sites and web folders.

#### To Enable WebDAV for a Site
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **Sites** pane, double-click the site you want to configure.
4. In the **Options** pane, select **WebDAV** and click **Save**.
5. Click **Realms**. Double-click a realm to edit it, or click the **Add** button to create a new realm.
   - The realm is the part of the website users can access.
6. Enter the name you want users to see when they log in.
   - The default realm name is "untitled."
7. If you want digest authentication for the realm, choose **Digest** from the **Authorization** pop-up menu.
   - Basic authorization is on by default.
8. Enter the path to the location in the website to which you want to limit access, and click **OK**.
   - You can also use the **Browse** button to locate the folder.
   - If you are administering a remote server, file service must be running on the remote server to use the **Browse** button.
9. Click **Save**.
   - The web service will restart automatically.

Note: If you have turned off the WebDAV modules in the **Modules** pane of Server Admin, you must turn them on again before WebDAV takes effect for a site. See “Apache Modules” on page 61 for more about enabling modules.

### Setting Access for WebDAV-Enabled Sites
You create realms to provide security for websites. Realms are locations within a site that users can view or make changes to when WebDAV is enabled.

#### To Add Users and Groups to a Realm
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **Sites** pane, double-click the site you want to configure.
4. In the **Realms** pane, select the realm you want to edit.
   - If no realm names are listed, create one using the instructions in “Enabling WebDAV on Websites” on page 30.
5. To set access for all users:
   - Select **Can Browse** or **Can Author** for **Everyone**.
     - **Browse**: Allows everyone who can access this realm to see it. You can add additional users and groups to the **User or Group** list to enable authoring for them.
     - **Browse and Author**: Allows everyone who has access to this realm to see and make changes to it.
   - If you want to assign access to specific users (and not to all users), do not select **Can Browse** or **Can Author** for **Everyone**.
6. To specify access for individual users and groups, click **Users & Groups** to open a drawer listing users and groups.
7. Click **Users** or **Groups** in the drawer’s button bar to show the list you want.
8. Drag user names to the **Users** field or group names to the **Groups** field.
   - You can also use the **add (+)** button to open a sheet in which you type a user or group name and select access options.
9. Select **Can Browse** and **Can Author** for each user and group as desired.
10. Click **Save**.
    - The web service will restart automatically.

Use the **Realms** pane to delete a user or group by selecting the name and clicking the **Delete (–)** button.

### WebDAV and Web Content File and Folder Permissions
Mac OS X Server imposes the following constraints on web content files and folders (located by default in `/Library/WebServer/Documents`):
- For security reasons, web content files and folders should not be writable by world.
- Web content files and folders are owned by user `root` and group `admin` by default, so they are modifiable by any administrator but not by user or group `www`.
- To use WebDAV, web content files must be readable and writable by user or group `www`, and folders must be readable, writable, and executable by user or group `www`.
- If you need to modify web content files and folders while logged in as an administrator, those files or folders need to be modifiable by the administrator.

If you want to use WebDAV, you need to enable it in Server Admin and manually change the web content files’ or folders’ ownership to user and group `www`. If you are using WebDAV and you want to make changes to web content files or folders while logged in as an administrator, you need to change the web content file and folder permissions to `admin`, make your edits, and then restore the file and folder permissions to `www`.

#### To Add Sites to Your Web Server While Using WebDAV
1. Change the group privileges of the folder containing your websites to `admin` (default folder location is: `/Library/Webserver/Documents`).
2. Add your new site folder.
3. Change the group privileges of the folder containing your websites back to `www`.

### Enabling Integrated WebDAV Digest Authentication
You can enable digest authentication for WebDAV realms in the **Realms** pane of Server Admin. See “Setting Access for WebDAV-Enabled Sites” on page 31 for more information.

### WebDAV and Web Performance Cache Conflict
If you enable both WebDAV and the web performance cache on one or more virtual hosts (sites), WebDAV clients may encounter problems if they try to upload multiple files in the Finder—the upload may fail to complete.

To avoid this problem, disable the web performance cache for virtual hosts with WebDAV enabled. See “Improving Performance of Static Websites (Performance Cache)” on page 26 for more information about the performance cache.

### Enabling a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Script
CGI scripts send information back and forth between your website and applications that provide different services for the site.

- If a CGI is to be used by only one site, install the CGI in the `Documents` folder for the site. The CGI name must end with the suffix `.cgi`.
- If a CGI is to be used by all sites on the server, install it in the `/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables` folder. In this case, clients must include `/cgi-bin/` in the URL for the site. For example, `http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test-cgi`.
- Ensure the file permissions on the CGI allow it to be executed by the user named `www`. Since the CGI typically isn’t owned by `www`, the file should be executable by everyone.

#### To Enable a CGI for a Website
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **Sites** pane, double-click the site you want to configure.
4. In the **Options** pane, select **CGI Execution**.
5. Click **Save**.
   - The web service will restart automatically.

### Enabling Server Side Includes (SSI)
SSIs allow a chunk of HTML code or other information to be shared by different webpages on your site. SSIs can also function like CGIs and execute commands or scripts on the server.

Note: Enabling SSI requires making changes to UNIX configuration files in the Terminal application. You must be comfortable with typing UNIX commands and using a UNIX text editor.

#### To Enable SSI
1. In the Terminal application, use the `sudo` command with a text editor to edit as the superuser (root).
2. Add the following line to each virtual host for which you want SSI enabled:
   ```apache
   Options Includes
   ```
   Each site is in a separate file in `/etc/httpd/sites/`.
   - To enable SSI for all virtual hosts, add the line outside any virtual host block.
3. In Server Admin for the server you want, click **Settings** in the button bar.
4. In the **Sites** pane, double-click one of the virtual host sites.
5. In the **General** pane, add `index.shtml` to the set of default index files for that site.
   - Repeat this procedure for each virtual host site that uses SSI. (See “Setting the Default Page for a Website” on page 25 for more information.)

By default, the `/etc/httpd/httpd.conf` file maintained by Server Admin contains the following two lines:
```apache
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
AddType text/html .shtml
```
You can add MIME types in Server Admin from the **MIME Types** pane. The changes take effect when you restart the web service.

### Viewing Website Settings
You can use the **Sites** pane of Server Admin to see a list of your websites. The **Sites** pane shows:
- Whether a site is enabled
- The site’s DNS name and IP address
- The port being used for the site

Double-clicking a site in the **Sites** pane opens the site details window, where you can view or change the settings for the site.

### Setting Server Responses to MIME Types and Content Handlers
MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) is an Internet standard for specifying what happens when a web browser requests a file with certain characteristics. Content handlers are similar and also use suffixes to determine how a file is handled. A file’s suffix describes the type of data in the file. Each suffix and its associated response together is called a MIME type mapping or a content handler mapping. See “Understanding Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension” on page 11 for more information.

#### To Set the Server Response for a MIME Type or Content Handler
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
3. In the **MIME Types** or **Content Handlers** pane, click the **Add** button, or select the item in the list you want to edit and click the **Edit** button.
4. If necessary, type a name for a new MIME type or content handler, then type the file suffix associated with this mapping in the **Suffixes** field.
   - If you use the suffix `cgi`, ensure you’ve enabled CGI execution for the website.
5. Click **Save**.
   - The web service will restart automatically.

### Enabling SSL
Before you can enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protection for a website, you must obtain the proper certificates. For more information, see “Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)” on page 45. Once you have obtained a certificate, you can set up SSL for a site.

#### To Set Up SSL for a Website
1. In Server Admin, select the server you want to configure and click **Web**.
2. Click **Settings** in the button bar.
