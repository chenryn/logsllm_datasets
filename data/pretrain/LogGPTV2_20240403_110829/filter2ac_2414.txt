To ensure that only valid password filters are registered, follow these steps:

1. **Filter DLL Location**: The filter DLLs must be located in the Windows installation directory, typically `C:\Windows\System32\`, on both domain controllers and local computers.
   
2. **Registry Entry**: There should be a corresponding entry in the registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages`.

3. **EnableMPRNotifications Policy (Windows 11 22H2 and Later)**: Starting with Windows 11 22H2, you can disable the `EnableMPRNotifications` policy to prevent Winlogon from sending credentials to network providers. This can be done through Group Policy or via a configuration service provider.

By following these guidelines, you can help secure your operating system configuration and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
