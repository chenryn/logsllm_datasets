Essentially, we always pay the cost of the initial captcha,
and then we pay a fractional cost for additional captchas that
is weighted by our chance of answering incorrectly. As an
example of expected solving time in action, a user solving a
Microsoft audio captcha, which takes on average 13 seconds,
and on which users have optimistic solving accuracy of 0.8
, the expected solving time is actually 16.3 seconds 25%
longer than the single captcha time would suggest. Table IV
shows optimistic solving accuracies for all captcha schemes.
VI. CAPTCHAS AND USER BACKGROUND
Having demonstrated that captchas are often quite difﬁcult
for humans, we turn to the question of why. Certainly
the various distortion methods used to to increase captcha
difﬁculty for computers play a role, but in this study we
focus on the characteristics of the people, not the captchas,
that predict captcha difﬁculty. Thus, we rely primarily on the
demographic data we collected from Turkers to investigate
these questions.
Overall we had more than 11800 demographic surveys
completed by Turkers. Since we authorized Turkers to
complete up to ﬁve image and audio tasks for us, it is likely
that some of these surveys are duplicates. However even
in the worst case, we had more than 1100 different people
answering our questions.
Figure 8.
overall and for each scheme
Optimistic solving accuracy for image and audio captchas,
live.com and mail.ru are also among the captcha schemes
with the slowest responses and the worst agreement.
For eBay image captchas, we see an accuracy of 93%,
which is a little less than the 98.5% found in the statistics
collected by eBay. This is probably because on the eBay
site the user may ask for a new captcha before solving
it
if they think the current one is too hard. That our
approximate measurements are at least within a few points of
the eBay measurement suggests that our solving accuracies
are reasonable.
Figure 8 shows optimistic solving accuracy for all au-
dio the schemes, in blue. Google is the hardest of these
schemes, with Turkers achieving only 35% accuracy, while
slashdot.com and yahoo.com are the easiest schemes, with
Turkers achieving 68% accuracy for both of them. Overall,
these numbers track closely our earlier results looking at
solving agreement, and suggest the need for further research
to investigate what makes an audio captcha easy or hard.
4) Expected Solving Time: The previous sections have
showed a number of ways of measuring captcha friction on
users. One way of unifying these all into a single measure
is through expected solving time. The expected solving time
of a captcha is the total amount of time a user should expect
to spend, including not just the time to respond to the initial
captcha, but also any time required to respond to additional
captchas if the ﬁrst is failed. Expected time can be measured
by the following inﬁnite summation, where t is the time it
takes to answer a single captcha, and a is the user’s solving
accuracy:

Figure 12. Average image captcha solving time for native and non-native
speakers of English.
First, it is useful to get a general picture of the Turkers
that worked for us. Figure 9 shows the age distribution of
our workers - the average age was around 29 years, and
almost half of our workers were 25 or younger. Figure 10
shows the native language distribution - Tamil and English
accounted for 40% and 32% of the languages, respectively,
leaving only 28% distributed to all other languages. Finally,
Table 11 shows the distribution of education levels showing
that over 72% of our workers had a bachelor’s degree or
higher. Overall, our Turkers represent a young, educated,
primarily Tamil and English speaking population.
Our ﬁrst question was about the effect of native language:
can non-native speakers of English perform as well as
native speakers on captchas? Figures 12 and 13 show the
solving time and solving accuracy for native and non-native
speakers, broken down by image captcha scheme. Overall
on image captchas, native speakers are substantially faster
and slightly more accurate. Looking across the schemes, the
schemes that use real words, like recaptcha, and pseudo
words, like Google, are solved far faster (up to 30%) by
native English speakers. This last point
is important as
it suggests that captcha schemes that rely on extensive
experience with a single language can be biased against users
who are not native speakers of that language.
Considering audio captchas, we still see that non-native
speakers of English are usually somewhat slower than na-
tive speakers, though for reCaptcha the times are roughly
comparable. As for image captchas, solving accuracy is
lower across the board for non-native speakers. Moreover,
the language bias is again illustrated by the the Slashdot

audio captchas, which are based on spelling English words:
the solving time for non-native speakers is 18.39 seconds,
7.4 seconds longer (57%) than the expected solving time
for native speakers. Thus, some signiﬁcant work needs to
be done to make audio captchas reasonable for globally
deployed web applications.
We also investigated questions of aging: how does per-
formance differ for old and young users? Figures 16 and
17 show that there is a lot of variation in both solving

Of course, we are interested not just in speed, but also
in accuracy, and so Figure 19 shows optimistic solving
accuracy for Turkers with different
levels of education.
Overall the correlation between having a higher education
and being more efﬁcient at solving captchas does not seem
to hold in our data. However, we are relying on self reported
education levels in this work, and it is possible that there is
therefore noise in our data as some Turkers may perceive
reporting a higher education level as an opportunity to get
offered better tasks on Mechanical Turk.
VII. ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK
The closest work to our is that of [3] where they looked
at usability issues in presenting audio captchas to humans.
Though they only used 10 captchas from each of 10 sites,
they also found audio captchas to be more time consuming
and difﬁcult than image captchas, and introduced a new user
interface to make audio captchas more accessible.
The ﬁrst discussion of the captcha idea appears in [22],
though the term CAPTCHA was coined in [24]. Text/image
based captchas have been studied extensively [6], [18], [19]
and there is a long record of successful attempts at breaking
captchas of popular sites [8]. For example in March 2008, a
method to break 60% of MSN visual captchas was disclosed
[26]. One of the most famous visual captcha breakers is
PWNtcha [16]. In [14], Hernandez-Castro and al use a side
channel attack to break labeling captcha. In [12], Golle
use learning attack to break the Asirra scheme. Tam and
his colleagues [23] built a breaker for audio captchas from
google.com, digg.com and an older version of recaptcha.net.
In [4], Cain et. al. studied the relation between captchas
and network security. In [25], Yan et. al. used naive pattern
recognition to break image captchas. In [1], Athanasopoulos
et. al. used animation as captchas. A comparison of human
and computer efﬁciency to recognize single characters was
explored in [5]. Many ways of building captchas have
been proposed [7], [9]–[11], [17]–[19] Finally, many other
techniques have been used to break captchas [20], [21], [27]
VIII. CONCLUSION
We have presented a large scale study of how much
trouble captchas present for humans. We collected 5000
captchas from each of 13 most widely used image captcha
schemes and 3500 captchas from the 8 most widely used
audio captcha schemes, and had them each judged by
multiple human subjects from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk
and an underground captcha-breaking service. Overall, we
found that captchas are often harder than they ought to be,
with image captchas having an average solving time of 9.8
seconds and three-person agreement of 71.0%, and audio
captchas being much harder, with an average solving time
of 28.4 seconds, and three-person agreement of 31.2%. We
also found substantial variation in captcha difﬁculty across

levels.
time and solving accuracy for users of all ages. However
there are small trends visible in these graphs - each year,
users slow down by about 0.01 seconds, and become more
accurate by about 0.01%. These ﬁndings are in line with
some psychological research on aging [15] where older
people are found to be more accurate than younger subjects
who demonstrate greater speed but more errors.
Finally, we looked into the effect of education: do users
with more or less education have an advantage in solving
captchas? Figure 18 shows solving time for Turkers with
different levels of education. There is a small decrease in
solving time of image captchas as higher levels of education
are obtained, starting at 9.6 seconds for Turkers with no
formal education, and dropping to 7.64 seconds for Turkers
with a Ph.D. With audio captchas, on the other hand, more
education doesn’t seem to make people faster: Turkers with
only a high school education were faster than Ph.D.s, and
Turkers with bachelors or masters degrees were substantially

the easiest, and google.com audio captchas being among
the hardest. We observed that the workers from Mechanical
Turk were quicker and more accurate than those from the
underground service, and were also willing to solve captchas
for smaller amounts of money.
Using the data collected from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk,
we identiﬁed a number of demographic factors that have
some inﬂuence on the difﬁculty of a captcha to a user.
Non-native speakers of English were slower, though they
were generally just as accurate unless the captcha required
recognition of English words. We also saw small trends indi-
cating that older users were slower but more accurate. These
results invite future research to more deeply investigate how
individual differences inﬂuence captcha difﬁculty.
