            }
        } catch (TransformationFailedException $e) {
            // the exception is caught here and is not throw again 
            $this->synchronized = false;
            // If $viewData was not yet set, set it to $submittedData so that
            // the erroneous data is accessible on the form.
            // Forms that inherit data never set any data, because the getters
            // forward to the parent form's getters anyway.
            if (null === $viewData && !$this->config->getInheritData()) {
                $viewData = $submittedData;
            }
