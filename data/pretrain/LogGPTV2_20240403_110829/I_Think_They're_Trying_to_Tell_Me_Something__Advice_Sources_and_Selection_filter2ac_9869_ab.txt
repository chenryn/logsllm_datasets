### For Each Finding

For each finding, we report the number of participants who expressed a particular sentiment as an indication of its prevalence. However, our results are qualitative rather than quantitative. The absence of a participant mentioning a specific item does not imply disagreement; it may simply mean that the participant did not address it. Consequently, we chose not to use statistical hypothesis tests for comparisons among participants. While our results may not be statistically generalizable beyond our sample, they offer valuable insights and suggest numerous areas for future research, contributing novel findings to the body of work on users' strategies for learning digital security behaviors.

### E. Limitations

Our study, like many qualitative studies, has several limitations. Despite asking participants to recall their experiences, they may not have fully remembered or may have forgotten some information. We also assume that participants can accurately identify which of their behaviors are security-related and explain why they practice them. To mitigate the risk of satisficing [46], interviewers repeatedly prompted participants to provide comprehensive answers. Additionally, participants may have become fatigued toward the end of the interview, leading to less thorough responses. Some participants might have altered their answers to align with what they perceived as socially acceptable, either to appear more secure or less insecure [46], [47]. Furthermore, the age, gender, and race of the interviewers could have introduced bias into participants' responses. To address these limitations, we recruited a diverse pool of participants to increase the likelihood that relevant ideas would be mentioned by at least one participant.

### IV. Results

In this section, we present the detailed results of our study. First, we discuss the demographics and security sensitivity of our participants, summarized in Table I. Second, we examine the sources from which participants accept security advice and how these sources differ across genders and between physical and digital security, as shown in Figure 1. Third, we analyze the reasons participants gave for accepting or rejecting digital and physical security advice, noting some unanticipated differences. Fourth, we explore the differences between security-sensitive and general participants, suggesting that exposure to digital security information in the workplace may influence advice processing. Finally, we present a case study on two-factor authentication, a behavior found by Ion et al. to have high security importance but low adoption [8].

#### A. Participants

We initially recruited 158 potential participants and selected 47 for interviews, ensuring a balanced representation of men and women, as well as a diversity of age, ethnicity, and education. Of the 47 selected, 25 attended their interview appointments. The demographics of these 25 participants are detailed in Table I. Fifty-six percent of our participants are female, slightly higher than the 51% in the general U.S. population in 2014 [48]. Our sample is somewhat less Hispanic (8% vs. 17%) and less White (40% vs. 62%), but more Black (44% vs. 13%) than the U.S. population [48]. The racial composition of our sample more closely matches the Washington D.C. metro area, which is 43% White (our sample: 40%), 46% Black (our sample: 44%), 10% Hispanic (our sample: 8%), and 4% Asian (our sample: 8%) [49]. Our participants are generally wealthier than the average U.S. household, with only 28% having a household income under $50,000, compared to 47% in the general U.S. population and 40.1% in the D.C. area [49], [50]. However, our sample is representative of the educational attainment in the D.C. area, with 88% holding a high school degree or higher (compared to 90.1% in the D.C. area) and 60% holding a Bachelor’s degree or higher (compared to 55% in the D.C. area) [49].

#### B. How Security Behaviors Are Learned

Participants reported learning digital and physical security advice from various sources. While many sources, such as media, peers, and family, were common to both, this section highlights unique sources for digital security, including IT professionals, the workplace, and service providers (e.g., Comcast). We also discuss a new source: fictional portrayals of negative security events in TV shows and movies. Our findings emphasize and expand on prior research about the importance of negative security stories in teaching digital security behaviors [3]. We then examine common sources—media, family members, and peers—in more detail, focusing on which specific people and sources participants consider authoritative. Finally, we include an interpretive section discussing gender-based differences in advice sources.

**Digital Only: IT Professionals**

IT professionals are a key source of information for digital security methods (N=12). These professionals can be colleagues or friends. As discussed in Section IV-C, a participant's trust in the source is a primary factor in whether they accept the advice. Participants view IT professionals as particularly trustworthy. For example, P15 said, "For personal [digital security advice], I might talk to one of the IT guys about that. I just talk to... the one I’m most friends with, I always try to get information: what’s the best intervention, what do you think?" Participants also use IT professionals to evaluate the trustworthiness of advice from other sources. P19 noted, "When I am looking for new digital-security advice, I will talk to the IT guy at my office. I’ve talked to him a couple of times about my phone and whatever I hear or read." Although participants receive useful advice from IT professionals, it may not always be sufficient. P13 observed, "My friends who work in IT, they just tell you to change your password as often as possible."

**Digital Only: Workplace**

In addition to solicited advice from IT professionals, participants receive unsolicited security advice from their workplaces through newsletters, IT emails, and required trainings. Fourteen participants cited receiving such advice. P4, for instance, learned from work not to click links in emails claiming she needs to update her password. "We got an email from IT telling us that, never will there be an email from them that would require you to do that." Similarly, P8 pays attention to her security trainings at work: "They’ll do yearly IT security training, which is not even necessarily for work, but just for life... they talk about things like not sending people money over Facebook... they also email out updates when things change. I do actually pay attention to those emails when they send them, like about privacy notice updating." P2 also mentioned, "I always read the IT newsletter put out by my workplace."

**Digital Only: Service Provider**

Another source of digital security information, cited by nine participants, is the corporations that provide services (e.g., SunTrust).
