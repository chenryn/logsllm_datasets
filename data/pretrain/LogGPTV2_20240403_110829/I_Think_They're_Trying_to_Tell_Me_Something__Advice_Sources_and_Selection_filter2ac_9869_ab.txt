For each ﬁnding, we state the number of participants
who expressed this sentiment, as an indication of prevalence.
However, our results are not quantitative, and a participant
failing to mention a particular item for which we coded does
not imply they disagree with that code; rather the participant
may have simply failed to mention it. As a result, we opted
not to use statistical hypothesis tests for comparisons among
participants. Our results are not necessarily statistically gener-
alizable beyond our sample; however, they suggest many areas
for future work and provide novel contributions to the body of
work surrounding users’ strategies for learning digital-security
behaviors.
E. Limitations
Our study has several limitations common to qualitative
research. While we asked participants to search their memory
for answers to our questions, they may not have fully done
so, or they may have forgotten some information. Further, we
assume that participants are largely able to correctly identify
which of their behaviors are security behaviors and why they
practiced those behaviors. To mitigate satisﬁcing [46], inter-
viewers repeatedly prompted participants to give full answers
to all questions. Participants may also have tired and provided
less thorough answers toward the end of the interview, and
those who were particularly concerned about the interviewer’s
perception of them may have altered their answers in order
to not portray themselves as overly secure or insecure [46],
[47]. Additionally, the age, gender and race of the interviewers
may have introduced some bias into participants’ responses.
We recruited a diverse pool of participants to increase the
odds that relevant ideas would be mentioned by at least one
participant, despite these limitations.
IV. RESULTS
In this section we detail the results of our study. First,
we will discuss our participants’ demographics and security
sensitivity. An overview of these demographics is shown in
Table I. Second, we will address the sources from which
participants accept security advice and how these sources
differ across genders and for physical and digital security. A
summary of these sources is shown in Figure 1. Third, we
will address the different reasons our participants gave for
accepting and rejecting digital- and physical-security advice;
some of the differences in these reasons were unanticipated.
Fourth, we address differences between security-sensitive and
general participants, which imply imply that exposure to
digital-security information in the workplace may have effects
on advice processing. Finally, we present a case study on two-
factor authentication, a behavior found by Ion et al. to have
high security importance, but low adoption [8].
A. Participants
We recruited 158 potential participants and selected 47 to
interview. We selected a balance of men and women, as well
as a diversity of age, ethnicity, and education. Of the 47
participants selected for interviews, 25 attended their interview
appointments.
Demographics for our 25 participants are shown in Table I.
Fifty-six percent of our participants are female, slightly more
female than the general U.S. population in 2014 (51%) [48].
Our sample is somewhat less Hispanic (8% vs. 17%) and
less White (40% vs. 62%), but more Black (44% vs. 13%)
than the U.S. population [48]. We had a proportional number
of Asian participants (8%). However, the racial makeup of
our sample more closely matched the racial proportions of
the Washington D.C. metro area, which is 43% White (our
sample: 40%), 46% Black (our sample: 44%), 10% Hispanic
(our sample: 8%) and 4% Asian (our sample: 8%) [49]. Our
participant sample is wealthier than the US population and our

demographic area: 28% of our participants have a household
income under $50,000, whereas 47% of households in the
general US population and 40.1% of households in the D.C.
area earn less than $50,000 per year [49], [50]. Our sample
is, however, representative of the educational attainment in
our demographic area: 88% of our participants hold a high
school degree or higher, compared with 90.1% per the D.C.
area census; and 60% of our participants hold a Bachelor’s
degree or higher, compared to 55% in the D.C. area [49].
B. How Security Behaviors Are Learned
Participants reported implementing digital- and physical-
security advice from a number of sources. While many
sources were common to both digital and physical security
(media, peers, family), in this section we emphasize advice
sources unique to digital security, including IT professionals,
the workplace, and providers of participants’ digital services
(e.g. Comcast). Next, we discuss a new source of security
information: ﬁctional portrayals of negative-security events
through TV shows and movies. Our ﬁndings emphasize and

expand prior ﬁndings on the importance of negative security
stories for teaching digital security behaviors [3]. We then
consider common sources – media, family members, and peers
– in more detail. We examine which speciﬁc people and
sources in this group our participants considered authoritative.
Finally, we include an interpretive section discussing gender-
based differences in advice sources.
Digital Only: IT Professionals.
IT professionals are an in-
formation source strictly for digital-security methods (N=12).
These professionals can be colleagues in a participant’s work
environment or friends of the participant. As we will discuss
in Section IV-C, a participant’s belief that a digital-security
advice source is trustworthy is a primary factor in whether
they choose to accept the advice; it seems that participants
view IT professionals as especially trustworthy. “For personal
[digital security advice], I might talk to one of the IT guys
about that. I just talk to . . . the one I’m most friends with,
I always try to get information: what’s the best intervention,
what do you think?” comments P15. Further, participants may
use IT professionals to evaluate the trustworthiness of advice
they have seen elsewhere. For example, P19 says that when she
is looking for new digital-security advice, she will “talk to the
IT guy at my ofﬁce. I’ve talked to him a couple of times about
my phone and whatever I hear or read.” Although participants
may receive useful advice from colleagues and friends who are
IT professionals, we hypothesize that this advice may not be
sufﬁcient. For example, as P13 notes: “My friends who work
in IT, they just tell you to change your password as often as
possible.”
Digital Only: Workplace.
In addition to information users
solicit from IT professionals, users also receive unsolicited
security advice from their workplaces in the form of newslet-
ters, IT emails, or required trainings. Fourteen participants
cited receiving this type of advice. P4 says, for example, that
she learned from work not to click links in emails that claim
she needs to update her password. “We got an email from IT
telling us that, never will there’ll be an email from them that
would require you to do that.” Similarly, P8 pays attention to
her security trainings at work: “They’ll do yearly IT security
training, which is not even necessarily for work, but just for

over Facebook . . . they also email out updates when things
change. I do actually pay attention to those emails when they
send them, like about privacy notice updating.” Further, P2
says she “always reads the IT newsletter” put out by her
workplace.
Digital Only: Service Provider. Another source of digital
security information cited by nine participants is the corpora-
tions that provide a service to the participant (e.g. SunTrust
