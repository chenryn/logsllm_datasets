the dissimilarity matrix D′
is converted to a
grayscale image with each dissimilarity measure in the
matrix corresponding to a pixel in the image I(D′) (line 16).
When using Equation 1, every value in D and D′ is guaran-
teed to be between 0 and 1 (inclusive). By representing 0 as
black, 1 and white and every value in between as a scaled
intensity, I(D′) is a trivial mapping of matrix dissimilarity
to pixel intensity.

C. Running Example
To assist RoleVAT comprehension, we present a simple
running example of a scaled version of the problem. While
RoleVAT is capable of analysing large datasets as shown in
our experimentation in Section IV, this section demonstrates
the fundamental steps that are required using a small dataset.
Table I contains the data that will be used in this example.
Table I(a) lists the users that have been assigned permissions.
This information can also be turned into permission sets that
are associated with users, as in Table I(b). For completeness,
the role assignments in relation to users and permissions for
RBAC are given in Tables I(c) and I(d).
Application of RoleVAT to permission analysis reveals
role tendency information and requires dissimilarity of user
sets. Using the information in Table I(a),
is
required for Algorithm 1 is {{Anu, Chris, Sue}, {Bob, Sue},
{Anu, Chris, Sue},{Anu, Chris, Sue}, {Bob, Sue}, {Anu,
Chris, Sue}}. Given {S}, the ﬁrst step of Algorithm 1 is
to generate dissimilarity matrix D (Lines 2–7). Using {S}
and Equation 1 as a similarity measure, the following matrix
with similarities to two decimal places can be generated.

The dissimilarity of d1,1 and any di,i will be 0, as seen
along the diagonal of matrix D. A set compared to itself will
always yield an exact match. To generate d1,2, dis(U1, U2)
is computed using U1 = {Anu, Chris, Sue} and U2 = {Bob,
Sue}.
dis(U1, U2) = 1 −

|{Anu, Chris, Sue} ∪ {Bob, Sue}|

Dissimilarity dis(U1, U2) = dis(U2, U1) and is placed into
d1,2 and d2,1 of matrix D, resulting in reﬂective values along
the diagonal. All similarities between pairs of permission
sets can be generated in this manner.
The next steps of Algorithm 1 reorders the matrix D to
produce D′ (lines 8–15). In accordance with Line 8, I, J
and P are as follows.
• I=∅, J ={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and P =(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
The highest dissimilarity value in D is 0.75, one of which
is in position d1,2. We choose this as the most dissimilar
value, and update I, J and P as follows.
• I={1}, J ={2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and P =(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
During the ﬁrst iteration of lines 11–14 to identify the next
most similar item, a search for the smallest dij where i ∈

After this position has been identiﬁed in line 12, line 13
updates the collections as follows.
• I={1, 3}, J ={2, 4, 5, 6} and P =(1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0)
The next iteration of lines 11–14 searches for the smallest
dij where i ∈ {1, 3}, j ∈ {2, 4, 5, 6}. After 5 iterations
of lines 11–14, all indices have been reordered with the
following sequence of updates.
• I={1, 3, 4}, J ={2, 5, 6} and P =(1, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0)
• I={1, 3, 4, 6}, J ={2, 5} and P =(1, 3, 4, 6, 0, 0)
• I={1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, J ={5} and P =(1, 3, 4, 6, 2, 0)
• I={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, J =∅ and P =(1, 3, 4, 6, 2, 5)
Using the resultant P =(1, 3, 4, 6, 2, 5), line 15 computes D′
as the following.

Finally,
the output produced in line 16 using D′
is
shown in Figure 1(a). Two dark squares can be seen along
the diagonal. Even though one user has been assigned to
both roles causing some similarity between the permission
clusters, the role tendencies clearly represent role1 and role2
from Table I(d).
For user cluster tendency analysis, users’ permission sets
are compared for similarity. In accordance with Algorithm 1,
the multiset {S} = {{perm1, perm2, perm3, perm4},
{perm2, perm5, perm6}, {perm1, perm2, perm3, perm4},
{perm1, perm2, perm3, perm4, perm5, perm6}} produce the
following dissimilarity matrices.

The resulting user group tendency image can be found in
Figure 1(b). From this image, it can be seen that the user
represented in position 1 of D′ is strongly dissimilar to the
user represented position 4 with some similarity with users
in position 2 and 3. Two or three user groups are possible.
However, due to the size of the example dataset, partitioning
of the data would not offer signiﬁcant beneﬁt.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section shows the results of the proposed RoleVAT
on both real and synthetically generated user permission
assignments. Real access control data was procured from
three undisclosed enterprises of difference sizes as well as
from an educational domain. To validate our ﬁndings further,
RoleVAT was also tested on synthetically generated data.
Details of datasets as well as processing times can be found
in Table II. The experiments analyse both user group and
role tendencies, and were run using a single core on a
2.38GHz Dell Zeon E5440 Server.
The data from the educational domain originates from
The Department of Computer Science and Software En-
gineering at The University of Melbourne. A Unix set
up has been adopted into this environment, where groups
are considered assignable permissions and users request
permission to certain groups when required. The RoleVAT
result on permission tendency is in Figure 2(a) and the user
tendency analysis result is in Figure 2(b). It can be seen
that neither user tendency nor permission tendency analysis
shows distinct user groups or roles. Permission sets appear
to be very unique with minimal overlap. There can possibly
be one partition where all users have similar permission
assignments, represented by the slightly larger black cluster
in the middle of Figure 2(b). However, users and permissions
exhibit strong dissimilarity with each other.
RoleVAT was also tested on three datasets from real
enterprise environments of small, medium and large sizes.
Like the data represented by Figure 2, the data from the
medium sized enterprise domain also does not have RBAC
implemented (Figure 3). There are apparent similarities be-
tween Figure 3(a) and Figure 2(a) for permission tendency.
Even though the number of permissions in the medium
enterprise domain is ten times the number of permissions
in the educational domain (as shown in Table II), it can be
seen that both datasets contain very distinctive permissions
with limited role cluster tendencies. User analysis of the
data in Figure 3(b) shows slight similarities between many
of the users, however the similarities are not strong, and
once again, no signiﬁcant groupings form.
The small and large datasets from enterprise domains both
have RBAC implementations. In the RoleVAT results on
these datasets (Figure 4 and Figure 5), it is possible to
see that both roles and user groupings exist. In the small
dataset shown by Figure 4, the large quantity of non-white
pixels imply high degrees of similarity. If all permissions are
very similar or if all users are very similar, only one role
or user group can be formed. However, groupings of both
permissions to form several roles and users to form multiple
user groups are apparent even with the high correlation.
Figure 4(a) shows permission tendency analysis for roles;
one distinctive role in the top left corner and two distinctive
roles in the bottom right corner. There are also roles in
the middle of the ﬁgure, some are large and some are
over lapping. The largest possible role grouping consumes
approximately a quarter of the image and can be seen to
contain roles within it. This can be due to a number of
possibilities. The ﬁrst is several roles are always assigned
together, causing the permissions in these roles to merge into
one permission cluster. The second is due to the presence of
overlapping permissions in roles. If one role contains all the
permissions of another role as well as other permissions (as
possible in Hierarchical RBAC [24]) or if two roles have a
common subset of permissions, the relationship will also be
present in the RoleVAT images. While it may be a challenge
to see all 25 roles exactly, RoleVAT analysis on permission
