ABSTRACT
This study presents Periscope, a novel side-channel attack that
exploits human-coupled electromagnetic (EM) emanations from
touchscreens to infer sensitive inputs on a mobile device. Periscope
is motivated by the observation that finger movement over the
touchscreen leads to time-varying coupling between these two.
Consequently, it impacts the screen‚Äôs EM emanations that can be
picked up by a remote sensory device. We intend to map between
EM measurements and finger movements to recover the inputs.
As the significant technical contribution of this work, we build an
analytic model that outputs finger movement trajectories based on
given EM readings. Our approach does not need a large amount of
labeled dataset for offline model training, but instead a couple of
samples to parameterize the user-specific analytic model. We imple-
ment Periscope with simple electronic components and conduct a
suite of experiments to validate this attack‚Äôs impact. Experimental
results show that Periscope achieves a recovery rate over 6-digit
PINs of 56.2% from a distance of 90 cm. Periscope is robust against
environment dynamics and can well adapt to different device mod-
els and setting contexts.

1 INTRODUCTION
Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have penetrated
into everyday life. People typically enter sensitive inputs to mo-
bile devices with virtual keyboards, including bank card num-
ber, security code, and digit PIN. Prior research has shown that
these keystrokes can be inferred from onboard motion sensor
readings [9, 30, 33, 36, 39, 57], acoustic signals at microphones
[7, 18, 29, 32, 46, 62], video recordings [5, 6, 11, 42, 45, 54‚Äì56],
and radio signals captured by surrounding wireless infrastructures
[1, 16, 27, 28, 61]. To access these side channels, most existing works
have to impose strong assumptions over attacker‚Äôs capabilities or
attacking scenarios. For example, motion sensor based attacks re-
quire the pre-installation of certain malware to victim‚Äôs device
to access sensor readings. Video based attacks rely on the line-
of-sight (LoS) view of the typing process or object of interest that
reflects typing motions. Radio signal based attacks analyze reflected
signals to characterize environment disturbance caused by finger
movements to learn which key is pressed. It cannot tolerate any
background context changes, as otherwise, the subtle signal fluc-
tuations introduced by finger movements are easily buried under
larger-scale signal variations caused by environment dynamics. All
the above restrictions render many existing keystroke inference
attacks impractical in real-world scenarios.
In this work, we present an attack that leverages electromag-
netic (EM) emanations leaked from device‚Äôs touchscreens to snoop
keystrokes. While the EM emanations have been explored for key-
stroke inference attacks [14, 51, 53], previous efforts have been
focused on physical keyboards. When a key is pressed, the key-
board sends a packet of information known as a scan code to the
computer. The scan code is bound to a physical button on the key-
board. The information leakage threat exists because part of the
internal circuit acts as an antenna and radiates unintentional en-
coded information in EM waves. The attacker can easily reproduce
each keystroke by relating it to its unique EM wave pattern. For
virtual keyboards on mobile devices, their working principle is
quite different. The way to recognize a keystroke does not rely on
the scan code, but rather the current changes in the electrode grid.
(Details will be covered in Section 4.1.) Thus, the fingerprinting EM
leakage from a specific physical button no longer exists.
For the first time, our attack analyzes touchscreen‚Äôs EM emana-
tions under the human coupling effect. As suggested by [43, 58], a
human body can be treated as a conductor with low impedance (a
few ùëò Œ©). When a user‚Äôs finger approaches the screen, it generates
a radiative coupling with the touchscreen‚Äôs circuit. A portion of

through the coupling capacitance. As the finger moves over a screen
to enter inputs, it changes the coupling capacitance. Consequently,
it influences the touchscreen‚Äôs EM emanations, which can be de-
tected by a remotely located eavesdropper. Our attack is built on
this phenomenon to map EM emanation fluctuations with finger
movements for performing keystrokes. Compared with state-of-
the-art inference attacks, our scheme is more practical to execute
from the following aspects. First, it eavesdrops keystrokes in a non-
invasive way. Hence, it avoids the requirement to infect the victim
device in advance of the attack. Second, as EM emanations can
easily penetrate through obstacles, no LoS view is needed to launch
the attack. Third, since our attack relies on direct EM radiations
from touchscreens rather than reflected signals, it is robust against
environment dynamics. We name our proposed attack as Periscope
as it can observe and disclose victim‚Äôs keystrokes covertly without
a LoS view.
Despite these promising features, harnessing EM emanations
for keystroke inference still faces a significant challenge, that is, to
establish a relationship between observed EM emanations and a
specific key press. A straightforward solution is to build a machine
learning model that maps between these two. For this purpose, the
attacker first needs collect labeled dataset of a reasonable size and
train the model properly. During the attack phase, unknown EM
emanations are fed into the trained model as inputs, with the out-
put as which key was most likely pressed. In fact, this approach is
adopted in most existing acoustic and radio signal based inference
attacks [1, 18, 27, 28, 61]. However, training significantly hinders
the attack deployment. As users‚Äô typing behaviors are distinct, user-
dependent inference models are preferred to capture this unique-
ness. It requires either access to the victim‚Äôs device for some time
or possession of her labeled dataset.
To avoid the training hurdle, we aim to develop an analytic
model that characterizes the relation between EM emanations and
keystrokes. To facilitate the analysis, we divide the continuous EM
readings of entering the entire PIN into several segments, each
associated with one key pair. By looking into the equivalent cir-
cuits of the touchscreen with finger coupling, we first derive the
closed-from expression between realtime EM readings and instant
finger-screen distances. Nonetheless, the latter may not directly
reflect specific keystrokes. To fill the gap, we further estimate the
finger movement speed and direction of entering one key pair. With
these parameters, time-dependent finger-screen distances are equiv-
alently transformed to a 3D finger movement trajectory, which are
further cast to two 2D planes. The projected trajectories reveal fin-
ger movement lengths for entering one key pair in both horizontal
and vertical directions on the screen. After such projection and
transformation, we establish an explicit relation between EM read-
ings and finger movements. Meanwhile, we notice that different key
pairs may share an identical finger movement trace. To alleviate the
inference ambiguity, we propose to explore the inter-dependency
between consecutive key pairs to narrow down possible keystrokes.
We model the entire PIN entering process as a Hidden Markov
Model (HMM), with the recovered finger movement traces as ob-
servations, whereas the exact key pairs as hidden states. Finally,
HMM outputs a list of PINs ranked based on their probability of
being the target PIN.
To evaluate the proposed Periscope, we build a prototype with an
Arduino board [3] and a conductive wire, with the total cost around
$10. Extensive experiments show that our Periscope achieves a
recovery rate over 6-digit PINs of 56.2% at a distance of 90 cm. Tests
also show that Periscope is robust against environment dynamics
and transparent to attacker displacement. Besides, it stays effective
for a diverse set of devices and environment context. We summarize
the contributions of this paper as follows.
‚Ä¢ We investigate a novel side-channel attack to eavesdrop
user‚Äôs digit inputs on mobile devices by analyzing human-
coupled EM emanations from touchscreens. While EM ema-
nation based inference attacks have been studied on physical
keyboards before, they are inapplicable to virtual keyboards
due to their distinctive working principles.
‚Ä¢ By analyzing touchscreen circuits under the human coupling
effect, a closed-form expression is derived to characterize
the relation between EM readings and finger movements.
With the analytic model, keystrokes can be easily recovered
from EM readings without training hurdles.
‚Ä¢ We develop a prototype and demonstrate the severity of the
threat. It outperforms state-of-the-art inference attacks in
terms of setup practicability with much fewer deployment
restrictions. Besides, the total cost of the prototype is as low
as $10.
2 RELATED WORK
Existing keystroke inference attacks that exploit side-channel in-
formation can be broadly classified into the following categories.
Motion sensor based attacks. Efforts have been made on in-
ferring user‚Äôs keystrokes from data generated by on-board motion
sensors. Early works [9] and [39] utilize mobile device‚Äôs accelerom-
eter readings to infer victim‚Äôs passwords. By further involving
gyroscope, [36] and [57] are able to increase the attack success rate.
In this line of research, some recent works [30, 33] show that the
similar idea can be applied to wearables to snoop victim‚Äôs inputs.
However, these attacks cannot succeed unless the victim device is
pre-installed with certain malware to acquire motion sensor data,
which limits their applicability.
Acoustic signal based attacks. Genkin et al. [20, 21] are among
the first to study acoustic cryptanalysis that exploits sounds emitted
by computers or other devices to reveal sensitive information. Some
keypads such as ATM inputs and door keypads provide an audio
feedback to the user for each button pressed. Such audio feedback
is observable from a fair distance. Prior works [7, 18] quantify the
delays between feedback pulses to reconstruct the keystrokes. This
type of attack is susceptible to acoustic background noise. Besides,
not all keypads emit audio feedback. Another line of research infers
user inputs by employing acoustic ranging techniques. They uti-
lize microphones to locate finger taps and thus the corresponding
buttons on a screen [29, 46, 62]. It is not easy to derive an ana-
lytic model that characterizes finger movement trajectory with
respect to audio sound. Researchers [4, 52, 63] have to resort to
machine learning techniques and train classifiers to reconstruct
the keystrokes so far. Tedious data sample collection and offline
training process are unavoidable.

techniques, video based attacks have been investigated for a while.
Its idea is to use cameras to record the typing process or an object
that reflects typing motion and then identify inputs by analyzing
the recorded video. Prior works have demonstrated the feasibility of
launching inference attacks by recording hand movement [45, 56],
eye movement [11, 54, 55], tablet backside motion [47], reflections
from nearby objects (e.g., glasses and plastic bottle) [5, 6, 42]. In
these attacks, cameras should have a LoS view for object of interest;
otherwise, keystroke activities cannot be detected. Besides, this
type of attack does not work under poor lighting conditions.
Radio signal based attacks. Emerging research efforts have
been made on eavesdropping keystrokes from radio signals due to
the wide deployment of wireless infrastructures (e.g., WiFi and cel-
lular towers). In particular, prior works [1, 16, 27, 61] reveal victim‚Äôs
keystrokes via the WiFi channel state information (CSI). Ling et al.
[28] recovered the typed PIN on an ATM by analyzing the reflected
cellular signals. As they rely on wireless infrastructures to launch
the attack, the signal strength is relatively strong. Hence, the at-
tacking distance is up to several meters. On the other hand, as radio
signals are highly susceptible to environmental dynamics, these
attacks cannot tolerate any changes in the environment other than
the victim‚Äôs hand or finger movement. As Periscope utilizes direct
EM radiations from the device‚Äôs touchscreen rather than reflected
signals from the target, it is robust against environment dynamics.
Besides, no extra wireless infrastructure is needed to launch the
attack. Like acoustic signal based attacks, due to the complexity
of formulating the relationship between observed wireless distur-
bances and specific key presses, radio signal based attacks typically
resort to machine learning techniques too. Recently, Fang et al. [16]
proposed a training-free keystroke inference attack by leveraging
structures of dictionary words. They built a prototype with USRP,
with a total cost around several thousand dollars.
EM emanation based attacks. EM radiations unintentionally
leak from electronic devices. It has been investigated as a side
channel to and victim‚Äôs keystrokes on physical keyboards [14, 51,
53]. Notably, each key is associated with a unique scan code. Once
it is pressed, the PC recognizes the key by reading the imported
information through the data cable. The attack is based on the
observation that the encoded keystroke information is radiated to
the open air the form of EM emanations as it is transmitted over
the cable. The working principle of soft keyboards is different. A
keystroke is recognized by locating the touched position on a screen
surface from current changes. Therefore, the existing eavesdropping
method toward physical keyboards is inapplicable here. For the
first time, Periscope examines the EM radiation changes caused
by human coupling effects when a finger performs keystrokes. We
then build a mapping relation between EM emanations and finger
movement trajectory which serves as the foundation of our attack.
EM emanations have also been exploited to infer displayed in-
formation on a device‚Äôs screen [24, 31, 49], profile device memory
usages [12], and identify the model of LCD monitors [37], which
are parallel to what we study here.
A comprehensive comparison with related works is summarized
in Table 4 in the Appendix.

3 ADVERSARY MODEL
Attack scenario. The attack scenario is considered as that an ad-
versary seeks to infer a victim‚Äôs secret PIN by eavesdropping her
keystrokes on a mobile device. As shown in Figure 1, the victim
places her device on a table and types on a soft numeric keyboard
on the screen. Such scenarios are prevalent in daily life, such as in a
library or a cafe where users unlock their smartphones by entering
digit PINs. A similar setting is considered in prior works [27, 34, 47].
We plan to investigate in our future work a more complicated sce-
nario that an attack is launched when a victim user holds the mobile
device. The attacker is assumed in physical proximity to the victim.
It is well concealed, e.g., placed underneath a table or in a bush
nearby [34]. We focus on soft numeric keyboards with a classic
layout, though the attack can target other layouts just as easily.
What an attacker cannot do. Unlike many prior keystroke
inference attacks, the attacker does not necessarily have a LoS view
of victim‚Äôs keyboard or any other object of interest, such as hand
movement, eye movement, and tablet backside motion. We do not
