ABSTRACT
Today’s phishing websites are constantly evolving to deceive users
and evade the detection. In this paper, we perform a measurement
study on elite phishing domains where the websites impersonate
trusted entities not only at the page content level but also at the
web domain level. To search for elite phishing pages, we scanned
five types of squatting domains over 224 million DNS records and
identified 657K domains that are likely impersonating 702 popular
brands. Then we build a novel machine learning classifier to detect
phishing pages from both the web and mobile pages under the
squatting domains. A key novelty is that our classifier is built on
a careful measurement of evasive behaviors of phishing pages in
practice. We introduce new features from visual analysis and optical
character recognition (OCR) to overcome the heavy content obfus-
cation from attackers. In total, we discovered and verified 1,175
elite phishing pages. We show that elite phishing pages are used for
various targeted scams, and are highly effective to evade detection.
More than 90% of them successfully evaded popular blacklists for
at least a month.

1 INTRODUCTION
Today, phishing attacks are increasingly used to exploit human
weaknesses to penetrate critical networks. A recent report shows
that 71% of targeted attacks began with a spear phishing [19], which
is one of the leading causes of the massive data breaches [18]. By
luring the targeted users to give away critical information (e.g., pass-
words), attackers may hijack personal accounts or use the obtained
information to facilitate more serious attacks (e.g., breaching a com-
pany’s internal network through an employee’s credential) [17].
Phishing webpages, as the landing pages for phishing messages [30,
42, 56], are constantly involving to deceive users and evade detection.

Sophisticated phishing pages are constructed to impersonate the
webpages of banks, government agencies, and even the internal
systems of major companies [28]. In addition, phishing pages can
also impersonate the domain names of trusted entities via domain
squatting techniques [35, 40, 50]. For example, an attacker may
register a domain that looks like facebook.com using an interna-
tionalized domain name to deceive users, as shown in Figure 1.
While anecdote evidence suggests such “elite” phishing pages exist,
there is still a lack of in-depth understandings of how the phishing
pages are constructed and used in practice.
In this paper, we describe our efforts in searching and detecting
squatting phishing domains where the attackers apply imperson-
ation techniques to both the web content and the web domain. For
convenience, we use the term “squatting phishing” and “elite phish-
ing” interchangeably. Our goals are three-folds. First, we seek to
develop a systematic method to search and detect squatting phish-
ing domains in the wild. Second, we aim to empirically examine
the impersonation techniques used by the attackers to deceive users.
Third, we want to characterize the evasion techniques used by the
squatting phishing pages and their effectiveness to avoid detection.
To these ends, we design a novel measurement system SquatPhi
to search and detect squatting phishing domains. We start by de-
tecting a large number of “squatting” domains that are likely to
impersonate popular brands. Then, we build a distributed crawler
to collect the webpages and screenshots for the squatting domains.
Finally, we build a machine learning classifier to identify squatting
phishing pages. A key novelty is that our classifier is built based
on a careful measurement of the evasion techniques used by real-
world phishing pages These evasion techniques are likely to render
existing detection methods ineffective. Below, we describe each
step and the discuss our key findings.
Squatting Domain Detection. We focus on 702 highly popu-
lar online services (brands) and search for squatting domains that
are likely to impersonate them (e.g., Facebook, Paypal). We apply
five different squatting techniques [40, 51, 58] to generate candi-
date domains, including typo squatting, bits squatting, homograph
squatting, combo squatting, and wrongTLD squatting. By analyz-
ing over 224 million DNS records, we identified 657,663 squatting
domains, and crawled both the web version and mobile version of
their webpages (1.3 million pages) for 4 snapshots over a month.

novel machine learning classifier. Based on a ground-truth set of
4004 user-reported phishing pages (from PhishTank [9]), we char-
acterize common evasion techniques, and develop new features as
countermeasures. Particularly, we observe that evasion techniques
(e.g., code obfuscation, string obfuscation, and layout obfuscation)
often hide phishing related text in the source code or change the
layout of the phishing pages. To this end, we apply visual analysis
and optical character recognition (OCR) to extract key visual features
from the page screenshots (particularly the regions of the login
form). The intuition is that no matter how attackers obfuscate the
HTML content, the visual presentation of the page will still need
to look legitimate to deceive users. Our classifier is highly accurate,
with a false positive rate of 0.03 and a false negative rate of 0.06.
By applying the clas-

sifier to the 657,663 squatting domains, we identified and confirmed
1,175 squatting phishing domains (857 web pages, 908 mobile pages).
Our results suggest that squatting phishing pages exist but are
not highly prevalent among squatting domains (0.2%). In addition,
squatting phishing pages take advantage of all five domain squat-
ting techniques to deceive users, and are used for various targeted
scams. Examples range from setting up fake Google search engines
in Ukraine to scamming Uber’s truck drivers or impersonating a
payroll system to scam employees. Furthermore, squatting phishing
pages are more likely to adopt evasion techniques and are highly
effective in evading detections. More than 90% of phishing domains
successfully evaded popular blacklists such as VirusTotal (70+ black-
lists), PhishTank, and eCrimeX for at least a month. Our results
provide key insights into how to develop effective countermeasures.
Our paper has three main contributions:
• First, we propose a novel end-to-end measurement frame-
work SquatPhi to search and detect squatting phishing
pages from a large number of squatting domains.1
• Second, we perform the first in-depth analysis on squatting
phishing domains in the wild. Our results provide insights
into how squatting phishing pages impersonate popular
brands at both the domain and content level.
• Third, we empirically characterize the evasion techniques
used by squatting phishing pages. The results indicate that
existing detection methods are likely to be ineffective and
need to be improved.
2 BACKGROUND & MOTIVATIONS
We start by introducing the background of phishing, and defining
elite phishing pages that apply squatting techniques.
Phishing has been widely used by cy-

bercriminals to steal user credentials and breach large networks.
Typically, attackers would impersonate a trusted entity to gain the
victim’s trust, luring the victim to reveal important information.
Phishing pages often act as the landing pages of malicious URLs
distributed by phishing emails [42], SMS [56], or social network
messages [30]. The phishing pages usually contain a form to trick
users to enter passwords or credit card information.

As phishing attacks become prevalent [7], various phishing de-
tection methods have been proposed, ranging from URL black-
listing [23] to visual similarity based phishing detection [47] and
website content-based classification [61]. Visual similarity-based
phishing detection [47] aims to compare the original webpages
of popular brands to suspicious pages to detect “impersonation”.
Machine learning based methods [61] rely on features extracted
from the HTML source code, JavaScript, and the web URLs to flag
phishing websites. As phishing attacks evolve, we are curious about
the potential evasion techniques used by attackers in practice.
Domain name squatting is the act

of registering domain names that are likely to cause confusions
with existing brands and trademarks. Domain name squatting has
led to abusive activities such as impersonating the original web-
sites to steal traffic, and distribute ads and malware. A squatting
domain usually shares many overlapping characters at a targeted
domain. Common squatting techniques include bit mutation [51],
typo spelling [50] and homograph imitating [40]. Internationalized
domain names (IDN) can be used for domain squatting domains,
since IDNs can have a similar visual representation as the target
domains after encoding (Figure 1).
Squatting domains can cause trouble to users as well as the tar-
get brands. For example, users often mis-type the domain name
of the website they want to visit in the address bar (e.g., typing
facbook.com for facebook.com). As a result, users could be visit-
ing a website hosted under a squatting domain. Speculators register
squatting domains of popular brands and resell them with a much
higher price. Sometimes, popular brands (e.g., big banks) have to
purchase squatting domains that targeting their websites so that
they can redirect users back to the correct websites [2].
Squatting domains are nat-

urally powerful to conduct phishing attacks since the domain name
looks similar to the domain name of the trusted entities. We refer
phishing pages hosted under squatting domains as squatting phish-
ing pages. More formally, a squatting phishing page (Ps) is composed
of two properties: (1) the domain of the page is a squatting-based do-
main (S); and (2) the webpage contains deceptive phishing content
(W ). Ps = S ∨ W .
2.1 Research Questions
Our goal is to search and identify squatting phishing pages in the
wild. Through empirical measurements, we seek to understand
how attackers perform impersonation to deceive users and how
they perform evasion to avoid being detected. To achieve these
goals, we face two major technical challenges.
First, a lack of comprehensive sources of squatting domains. It is
challenging to capture a comprehensive list of squatting domains
that are potentially impersonating legitimate brands and online
services. More specifically, we are not looking for a specific type
of domain squatting, but aim to cover all different types of squat-
ting domains. Current phishing blacklists rarely include squatting
phishing pages. Later in §4.1, we show that most of the reported
phishing URLs in PhishTank [9] do not have squatting domains.
Second, a lack of effective phishing detection tools. Phishing pages
are constantly evolving. URL blacklisting is ineffective to detect
zero-day phishing pages. In addition, our preliminary analysis

shows that phishing pages have adopted evasion techniques that
are likely to render existing detection methods ineffective (§4.2) .
An efficient and yet evasion-resilient method is needed to detect
squatting phishing pages.
Instead of relying on phishing blacklists, we

decide to search for previous-unknown squatting phishing pages
in the wild. To do so, we develop a set of new tools for squatting
domain detection and phishing page classification. More specifically,
we select a large number of popular brands which are often tar-
geted (impersonated) by phishing pages. Then we directly search
for squatting domains that are likely to impersonate these brands
from hundreds of millions of DNS records. We build a tool to ef-
fectively identify known types of squatting domains including ho-
mograph squatting, typo squatting, bit squatting, combo squatting
and wrongTLD squatting.
To effectively detect phishing domains from the squatting do-
mains, we build a novel machine learning classifier that takes ad-
vantage of image analysis and optical character recognition (OCR)
to overcome page obfuscation. The classifier design is driven by
empirical measurements of evasion methods used in practice (based
on 4000+ manually labelled phishing pages). Once the classifier is
trained, we use it to search for squatting phishing pages within
a large number squatting domains. In the following, we describe
each of the measurement steps and our key findings.
3 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY
In this section, we introduce our measurement methodology to
search for candidate squatting domains. Then we introduce our
data collection process to obtain their webpages (both web and
mobile pages).
3.1 Squatting Detection
At the high-level, we first select a large set of popular brands and
online services which are the potential impersonation targets of
squatting phishing pages. Then we detect squatting domains for
each brand from massive DNS records.
Intuitively, popular brands are attractive tar-

gets. We select domains that are ranked high by Alexa [1]. More
specifically, Alexa provides 17 categories such “business”, “games”,
“health”, “finance”. For each category, we select the top 50 websites
(850 domains in total). Then we search for brands that are popular
targets of real-world phishing attacks. Based on the statistics from
PhishTank [9], we obtain 204 brands (domains). For all the domains,
we then merge some of them that share the same domain names
(e.g., merging niams.nih.gov and nichd.nih.gov into nih.gov). We
merge those that are co-listed by PhishTank and Alexa. In total, we
have 702 unique brands (domain names) that cover a wide range of
different online services.

snapshot of 224,810,532 DNS records from the ActiveDNS project [41]
on September 6, 2017. ActiveDNS project uses multiple seeds to
run active DNS probing, covering a number of top-level domains
(e.g., COM, NET, ORG) and other lists of domain collections (e.g.,
Alexa Top 1M, Public Blacklists). Each record is characterized by a
