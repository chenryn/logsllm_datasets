# Feature request
Currently, only the following meta tags can be duplicate as per the next/head
logic
    var ALLOWED_DUPLICATES = ['article:tag', 'og:image', 'og:image:alt', 'og:image:width', 'og:image:height', 'og:image:type', 'og:image:secure_url', 'og:image:url'];
So, it is not allowing me to render multiple og:see_also tag in meta using
next/head.
It would be great if these ALLOWED_DUPLICATES can be configured/override using
web-pack config/environment variable/nextconfig.
Please suggest.
