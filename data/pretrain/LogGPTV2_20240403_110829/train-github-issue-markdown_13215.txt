When performing a standard GET by ID operation, a single log entry is generated in the audit log. However, executing a search (_search) results in two identical log entries every time.

### Environment Details:
- **Elasticsearch (ES) Version:** 1.6.0 (default installation)
- **Shield Version:** Latest
- **User Added:** "search_admin"

### Issue Description:
The system functions correctly out of the box, but there is an anomaly where _search audits are duplicated in the log. This duplication only affects "SearchRequest" audits, and no other API calls have been observed to exhibit this behavior.

### Example Log Entries:
```plaintext
[2015-06-16 18:37:24,705] [esdev-shieldpoc01] [transport] [access_granted] origin_type=[rest], origin_address=[/10.30.24.36:55308], principal=[search_admin], action=[indices:data/read/search], indices=[test], request=[SearchRequest]
[2015-06-16 18:37:24,705] [esdev-shieldpoc01] [transport] [access_granted] origin_type=[rest], origin_address=[/10.30.24.36:55308], principal=[search_admin], action=[indices:data/read/search], indices=[test], request=[SearchRequest]
```

These log entries are identical and occur every time a _search request is made.
