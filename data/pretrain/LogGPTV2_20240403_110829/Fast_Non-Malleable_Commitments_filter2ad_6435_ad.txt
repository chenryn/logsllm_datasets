precomputation [BGMW92]. This provides a tremendous
improvement for both parties. We also use batch veriﬁca-
tion [LL94, BGR98] for each of the parties’ veriﬁcation of
repeated equations.
In particular, we use the bucket test
with small exponents. For further optimization we use the
Comba multiplication [Com90].
We implement our protocol over elliptic curves. Note
that [GRRV14] required the group size to be exponential in
the tag values, and therefore required approximately 6000
bits group size to achieve decent security. Our protocol,
on the other hand, allows using any group size (as long as
it is secure) regardless of the tags values. This allows us
to use more standard elliptic curves groups. We choose to
use NIST GF(P) elliptic curves, and construct our imple-
mentation in MIRACL SDK – an open source C software
library for elliptic curve cryptography. Our implementation
is generic for any EC parameters. Concrete measurements
of performance for our protocol are presented in table 3. For
example, to commit to a message of size 24,576 bits with El-
Gamal modulus of size 192 bits, tags of size 32 bits, it takes
approximately 4.5 giga clock cycles. That is, on average for
every committed bit we run approximately 0.19 mega clock
cycles.
