ABSTRACT
In this paper, we describe how the electronic rolling shutter in
CMOS image sensors can be exploited using a bright, modulated
light source (e.g., an inexpensive, off-the-shelf laser), to inject fine-
grained image disruptions. We demonstrate the attack on seven dif-
ferent CMOS cameras, ranging from cheap IoT to semi-professional
surveillance cameras, to highlight the wide applicability of the
rolling shutter attack. We model the fundamental factors affecting
a rolling shutter attack in an uncontrolled setting. We then per-
form an exhaustive evaluation of the attack’s effect on the task
of object detection, investigating the effect of attack parameters.
We validate our model against empirical data collected on two
separate cameras, showing that by simply using information from
the camera’s datasheet the adversary can accurately predict the
injected distortion size and optimize their attack accordingly. We
find that an adversary can hide up to 75% of objects perceived by
state-of-the-art detectors by selecting appropriate attack parame-
ters. We also investigate the stealthiness of the attack in comparison
to a naïve camera blinding attack, showing that common image
distortion metrics can not detect the attack presence. Therefore,
we present a new, accurate and lightweight enhancement to the
backbone network of an object detector to recognize rolling shutter
attacks. Overall, our results indicate that rolling shutter attacks can
substantially reduce the performance and reliability of vision-based
intelligent systems.

1 INTRODUCTION
Digital cameras are undoubtedly ubiquitous today, with units now
integrated into most mobile and IoT devices and already domi-
nant in photography, monitoring, and surveillance. With the on-
going integration of cameras into the decision-making process of
intelligent systems, such as consumer home-security [18, 36], com-
mercial security[3], blanket surveillance [31, 40], construction site
safety [13], retail [43], and vehicle automation [33, 54], the integrity
of the captured images is becoming a cornerstone of the correct
behavior of the system.
Recent academic work has produced many examples of disrupt-
ing camera-based intelligent systems using projections on sur-
faces in the environment [25, 29, 58], or the placement of printed
patches [14]. Attacks inhibiting the use of camera footage are well
known and repeatedly shown in different settings [33, 54].
Naïve disruption of cameras using powerful light projected at the
camera is straightforward and often effective, shown in academic
work [33] and real-world settings [8]. However, this disruption has
previously been coarse-grained, only blinding the camera entirely.
While blinding attacks may cause significant disruption, the pres-
ence of blinding is easily detected as it generates substantial and
sudden image changes. Additionally, blinding attacks trigger sig-
nificant exposure adjustments, where the camera has to reduce the
time the sensor is exposed to compensate for the increasing amount
of light, and are therefore generally considered suspicious [38, 46].
Yet, we show that extremely widespread image sensors can be ex-
ploited to obtain small-scale control over the captured images. This
is because Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)
image sensors typically implement an electronic rolling shutter
mechanism that captures the image in sequential rows instead of
all-at-once. As CMOS image sensors provide a convenient balance
between production costs and image quality, they have become the
major sensor technology used in modern cameras.
In this paper, we show how an adversary can exploit the elec-
tronic rolling shutter with a modulated light source and influence
the images captured by the camera in a fine-grained way. The cap-
tured pixels’ intensity can be varied arbitrarily in small bands of the

image, down to a handful of pixel rows given sufficiently bright con-
ditions. The attack is achievable with minimal preparation and no
greater aiming requirements than a naïve blinding attack, yet it can
be further optimized based on knowledge of the target camera to
enhance its effectiveness. The attack is particularly effective when
targeted at computer vision systems. As small-scale, high-frequency
information plays a crucial role in these systems [50], e.g., for edge
detection, the injection of fine-grained distortion has a more pro-
found effect on performance than naïve blinding attacks. This is
analogous to the injection of fine-grained, adversarial distortions
into image data [17], or the physical world [42].
In this work, we introduce rolling shutter attacks and study them
in practice. We model the dynamics of the electronic rolling shutter,
showing that all the parameters necessary to carry out an attack can
typically be inferred from the camera’s technical specifications. We
validate our modeling with empirical data collected from executing
the rolling shutter attack on two cameras, showing how such data
matches the expectations. We then investigate the stealthiness of
the rolling shutter attack, showing that compared to a blinding
attack, it causes only small changes in a set of commonly-used met-
rics for measuring image distortion. Nevertheless, we describe how
rolling shutter artifacts have an outsize effect on the performance
of a range of computer vision systems (illustrated in Figure 1). We
evaluate the attack for the object detection task: first, we physi-
cally reproduce the attack on seven different cameras, followed
by a broader evaluation showing that the rolling shutter attack
significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art object
detection networks, as shown in Figure 1a. Finally, we discuss coun-
termeasures for the attack detection, including introducing a new
countermeasure that re-uses part of the deep network for detec-
tion, and outline the attack limitations. In summary, we make the
following contributions:
• We model the mechanisms behind the rolling shutter, we
show that an attacker can accurately control the attack-
injected distortions simply by inferring parameters from
the target camera’s technical specifications. We validate our
modeling against empirical data by collecting a large dataset
of attack executions with real hardware.
• We perform an extensive evaluation of the rolling shutter
attack’s effect on the object detection task, by partially sim-
ulating it on the BDD100K and the VIRAT dataset, showing
that the integrity of object detection can be compromised.
• We assess the stealthiness of the attack across several metrics
on the BDD100K video dataset, our analysis highlights how
the rolling shutter attack is harder to detect in comparison
to a blinding attack.
• We discuss a range of countermeasures and propose an accu-
rate and lightweight enhancement to the backbone network
of an object detector to detect rolling shutter attacks.
2 RELATED WORK
Many cyber-physical systems rely on the physical measurements
of a wide variety of sensors ranging from temperature sensors
through cameras to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) [7, 21].
Since the integrity of sensor measurements is crucial for systems
to behave as intended, research has been conducted to evaluate the
vulnerabilities of sensors against signal injections on the physical
layer. Physical-layer attacks can be categorized by modality [15]
and substantial attention has been paid to each: electromagnetic
radiation [49, 54], acoustic waves [48, 53, 56] and optical emission [6,
32, 33, 41, 44]. In this work, we focus on the latter category.
Due to their wide range, the focused brightness, and the target-
ing accuracy, lasers are often the first choice for attacks against
optical sensors. [32] showed that an infrared laser could be used to
manipulate the measurements of a drop sensor in a medical infu-
sion pump. In [44], an amplitude-modulated laser was leveraged to
inject voice commands into the microphone of a voice-controlled
assistant. Lasers have also been used to inject spoofed points into
the sensor of a LiDAR system, leading to false-positive object de-
tection [6, 33, 41, 45], and to naïvely blind cameras necessary for
various Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) [33, 54].
In addition to attacks that directly target sensors on the physical
layer, intensive research has been conducted that highlights the vul-
nerability of environment perception systems of modern cars. [28]
demonstrated that cameras recognize objects projected onto the

road as genuine objects or obstacles leading to unintended maneu-
vers. Instead of projecting objects onto the road, [26] highlighted
that it is possible to project objects directly onto the camera lens.
Recently, [23] showed that the rolling shutter can be abused to
create a backdoor in the training dataset for face recognition sys-
tems. The closest work to our own is in [37], which demonstrated
that the rolling shutter can be exploited to cause misclassifications
in single-object scenes, in which the attacker controls the light
source for an enclosed environment. We go beyond the findings in
that work by relaxing some assumptions to a more generalized case,
in which the attacker can not enjoy full control over the scene light-
ing and must contend with further uncontrolled environmental and
camera specific parameters, such as the precise ambient light level,
frame rate and exposure time, along with cluttered, dynamic envi-
ronments. We analyze these factors in detail and develop a reliable
model of required conditions for an effective real-world attack. We
further validate our method on a range of cameras and show that
it works consistently, beyond the single target evaluated in [37].
We study the problem of rolling shutter attacks in a general setting
and describe their applicability and effectiveness in unconstrained
conditions.
3 IMAGE SENSOR TECHNOLOGY
3.1 Photodiode Arrays
An image sensor is composed of a two-dimensional array of unit
cells, also known as pixels. The central component of each pixel is
a photodiode, which absorbs incident photons and converts them
into a signal charge depending on the intensity of the light beam.
An image is captured by exposing each pixel in the photosensitive
array to incident light for a certain amount of time. This time is
known as the integration period [12], or exposure time. The longer
the integration period, the more photons are converted into signal
charge and the brighter the resulting image. To capture an image
and control its brightness, cameras implement an electronic shutter
mechanism. With electronic shutters, the image sensor is constantly
exposed to light and signal charge is continuously generated. How-
ever, the accumulated charge is flushed before reading, such that
only the light gathered during the specified integration time, be-
tween the reset and readout scan, represents the final image [20].
The length of the integration time is typically managed by an auto-
matic exposure control system, in which the measurements from
an integrated light meter are used to optimize the exposure period.
3.2 Scanning Element
The two most common image sensor technologies, Charge-Coupled
Device (CCD) and Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor
(CMOS), use different techniques to recover the accumulated signal
charge from the image array. The main difference is the arrange-
ment of scanning elements and measurement units in the chip.
Measurement units quantify the signal charge and convert it into
electrical signals, whereas scanning elements control the order in
which the captured signal charges are read [22]. While CCD sensors
have a single measurement unit, CMOS sensors have a measure-
ment unit in each pixel [27]. As a result, different electronic shutter
implementations exist — global and rolling electronic shutters.
(a) Electronic global shutter.
(b) Electronic rolling shutter.
Figure 2: Visualization of the frame acquisition in the time-
domain for the two shutter mechanisms.
Global Shutter. Image sensors with an electronic global shutter
simultaneously expose the entire photodiode array to incident light
and also read out the accumulated signal charge from it at once. In
CCD image sensors the individual pixels are connected via vertical
and horizontal shift registers that work as memory buffers. The sig-
nal charge is temporarily stored inside the memory buffers, while
the new integration period has already begun. Figure 2a illustrates
the readout of a CCD image sensor with an electronic global shut-
ter in the time-domain. The use of such memory buffer weighs on
production cost and chip size [51, 57], which lead to CCD image sen-
sors being most common in industrial and professional use [12]. In
comparison, in CMOS sensors, the individual pixels are connected
via metallic wires that cannot store the signal charge [22]. Even
though it is possible to implement an electronic global shutter in
CMOS sensors by changing the circuit and adding additional mem-
ory buffer, it is often not economically viable and would defeat the
main advantage — cheap manufacturing that enables widespread
use in consumer and semi-professional applications.
Rolling Shutter. Image sensors with an electronic rolling shut-
ter expose and read each row of the photodiode array one by one.
As a result, the readout of the last pixel row is slightly delayed
compared to the first one. An exemplary readout scan showing
the time delay between the rows is depicted in Figure 2b. Since
CMOS image sensors do not have a memory buffer, they can only
implement an electronic rolling shutter and thus suffer from im-
age distortions as a consequence of the delay between reading the
first and last pixel row — banding and geometric distortion [22].
The most common phenomena are skewed or compressed objects,
which can be observed particularly well when fast-moving objects
are captured. Another frequently occurring distortion is horizon-
tal banding, which is especially common in indoor environments
where dimmable LED lights are used. Since LEDs are often dimmed
by switching them on and off at a high frequency, bright horizontal
bars might appear in the captured image [10]. In our proposed
