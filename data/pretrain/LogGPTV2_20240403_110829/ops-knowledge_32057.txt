User: When I ran Homebrew's brew doctor (Mac OS X 10.9.2), I get the following warning message:

Warning: Python is installed at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework
Homebrew only supports building against the System-provided Python or
  a brewed Python. In particular, Pythons installed to /Library can
  interfere with other software installs.

Therefore, I ran brew install and followed the steps provided in the installation's caveats output to install Homebrew's version of Python. Running which python confirms that Homebrew's version of it is indeed at the top of my PATH. Output is /usr/local/bin/python.
Despite all this, when I rerun brew doctor, I am still getting the same warning message. How do I suppress this warning? Do I need to delete the /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework directory from my computer? Am I just supposed to ignore it? Is there a different application on my computer that may be causing this warning to emit?
Note that I don't have any applications in particular that are running into errors due to this warning from brew doctor. Also note that this warning message didn't always print out when I ran brew doctor, it was something that started to appear recently. Also, I am using Python 2.7 on my computer, trying to stay away from Python 3.
Assistant: I also received this message. 
Something, sometime installed 

/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework

on my machine (the folder date was about 4 years old).
I've chosen to remove it.
Please note that the Apple provided framework lives in 

/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/
