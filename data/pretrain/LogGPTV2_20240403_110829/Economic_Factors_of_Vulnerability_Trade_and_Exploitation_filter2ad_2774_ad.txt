ploits vary widely by software vendor, and are negatively correlated
with the age of exploit; Adobe and Microsoft exploits retain their
value significantly longer than Oracle exploits. This may indicate
a prolonged economic interest in the exploitation of Microsoft
and Adobe vulnerabilities, a finding consistent with related work
on the persistence of vulnerabilities on end-user systems [55].
Exploit vendors are a significant source of variance in price of ex-
ploit. Pseudo-R2 values indicate that the models’ power is adequate
in explaining the observed effect. In particular, Model 3 explains
approximately 40% of the variance in exploit price estimates. Im-
portantly, all variables of the model can be easily assessed with the
sole knowledge of the vulnerability at any point in time.
4.3 Exploitation in the wild
In this section we evaluate the effects of the identified market vari-
ables on the exploitation in the wild of traded vulnerabilities. A
consideration first: certain exploits may evade detection for some
time, for example by means of frequent exploit repacking. On the
other hand, it is unlikely for an exploit to remain completely under-
cover for a long time, while in the meanwhile delivering hundreds
of thousands or millions of attacks [7, 56]. To lower uncertainty
around exploit detection, we restrict our analysis to exploits pub-
lished in RuMarket at least a year ahead of the SYM data collection
(i.e. before the 1st of April 2016). This coincides with the median
lifetime of an exploit package in RuMarket (see Fig. 5), and allows
SYM a full calendar year to report an exploit at scale. We consider
effects before that time to be unlikely to be caused by type II errors
(i.e. no inclusion in SYM despite high attack volumes). This leaves
us with n = 78 exploits.
Package price and market activity vs exploitation. As we are con-
sidering the effect of the acquisition and deployment of an exploit
by the attacker, we consider cost of package (as opposed to cost of
exploit) because this reflects the upfront price the attacker needs to
pay in order to deploy the attack. Figure 11 reports the distribution
of package prices (left) and replies on the market (right) against
exploitation in the wild. Overall, we find that exploits in SYM are
traded at a lower upfront price than exploits not included in SYM.
Similar conclusions can be drawn for the effect of market interest
(as estimated by PackActivity) on exploitation: exploits to which
the RuMarket community dedicated greater attention have a higher
chance of exploitation in the wild than exploits around which de-
veloped less market activity. A break down by package types does
not reveal any significant interaction between the variables. These
results also support recent findings underlying the importance
of the economics of the attack process in the analysis of cyber-
attack scenarios [14, 20, 56, 72], and in the development of sensible
cybercrime-based measures for risk of cyber-attack [13, 39].
Vulnerability severity. Previous studies revealed the lack of corre-
lation between technical vulnerability characteristics and exploita-
tion [20]. The consideration of additional factors, such as presence
of exploit in the black markets [9], is often advised by experts
and best practices to obtain more significant tests for actual ex-
ploitation [38]. Following [9], we categorize vulnerabilities in two
categories defined by the respective CVSS severity score: critical
(C) (CV SS ≥ 9) and non-critical (NC) vulnerabilities (CV SS < 9).
Table 8 reports the corresponding distributions against SYM. Sup-
porting previous research findings on Exploit Kits alone [9], we
find that critical vulnerabilities traded in the cybercrime markets
have a higher chance of exploitation in the wild (93% in our sample)
than non-critical vulnerabilities (62%, p = 0.0021).
4.3.1 Regression analysis of exploitation in the wild. To more
rigorously evaluate the correlation between the identified market
and vulnerability variables and exploitation in the wild, we select
three logit regression models of the following form over the binary
response variable SYM:
M1: SY Mi = β0 + β1 log(PackActivityi) + ϵi
M2: SY Mi = · · · + β2 log(PackPricei) + ϵi
M3: SY Mi = · · · + β3 CVSS:NCi + ϵi
where SY M indicates presence or absence of exploit at scale; PackActivity
is the number of replies received by the product advert; PackPrice
is the upfront price to pay to obtain the exploit; and CV SS : NC is
the CVSS categorization of the vulnerability severity as non-critical.
Regression results are reported in Table 9.11 Coefficients should
be interpreted as the change in the odds ratio of exploit in the
wild. For example, Model 3 indicates that for every increase in one
unit of loд(PackActivity) there is a three-fold increase in odds of
exploitation in the wild (exp(1.101) = 3.01); the coefficient signif-
icance indicates that exploits bundled in packages around which
more market activity is developed are more likely to be detected in
the wild than exploits with less activity. Interestingly, we find that
package prices also have a significant and negative impact on odds
11An OLS robustness check run on average values of regressors for each CVE (reported
in the Appendix) yields equivalent results.

of exploitation. This indicates that, everything else being equal,
exploits bundled in more expensive packages are less likely to be
detected in the wild than comparable exploits bundled in less ex-
pensive packages. These findings weigh favorably on the existence
of a relation between market activity and exploit deployment in the
wild [9, 15, 56]. Vulnerability severity has also a negative impact on
likelihood of exploit, indicating that risk of exploitation for vulnera-
bilities in RuMarket increases for critical vulnerabilities. All models
show satisfactory Pseudo-R2 values, with Model 3 explaining most
of the variance.
5 DISCUSSION
Exploit measures. An important aspect of threat assessment is
the consideration of exploit metrics. Current approaches often im-
plement these by looking at the technical requirements of an at-
tack, including the evasion of attack mitigation measures [74] and
complexity of the attack [20]. While a technical assessment of the
‘operational’ requirements of an attack can shed light on the rela-
tive ordering of attack preferences, it is hard to quantify absolute
likelihoods. For example, a utility-maximizing attacker may decide
to not perform (or delay) an attack because they do not believe
that there is a positive payoff, given cost of exploit acquisition. Our
analysis gives the first pointers in this direction by quantifying the
relation between time, software, and exploit pricing. Importantly,
this estimate only requires readily available information on the
vulnerability, and the elastic relationship between age of exploit
and price of exploit can be used to evaluate relative changes in
exploit price as time passes. This directly affects current estimates
of attack cost used in risk assessment practices [20, 38, 74]. Simi-
larly, the update of attackers’ exploit portfolios is an important step
driving the variance in risk of attacks [10, 18]. We find that new
exploits are introduced at rates in between two and six months, and
are approximately equal for all software. The process driving this
update remains however to uncover: follow up studies may look
at the factors driving appearance of exploit in the markets (e.g. by
considering pre-existent exploits or software updates [10, 55]).
The dynamics of the underground markets have often been
pointed at as an important block of overall risk of attacks, but
a clear link between the two is currently missing. Whereas the
problem of attack attribution remains open (i.e. we cannot establish
a causality link), this paper provides important indications on the
correlation between market operations and realization of attacks.
This weighs in favour of the importance of economic aspects of
vulnerability exploitation to well-informed security practices (e.g.
vulnerability assessment and prioritization [38, 73]). For example,
our analysis of market activity and odds of exploitation in the wild
reveals a significant and positive relationship between the two.
Similarly, exploits that are more expensive to acquire have lower
odds of exploitation than ‘cheaper’ exploits. This information is
often ignored in risk-assessment studies [38], and condensed met-
rics for vulnerability assessment are used instead [54, 73]. Whereas
existing vulnerability metrics are known to not correlate to attacks
in the wild [9, 20], we find that they do once the effect of market
inclusion is considered as well. Importantly, this provides a useful
tool for a first evaluation of risk of exploit without insights from
the cybercrime markets other than whether the vulnerability is
present [9]. A more precise estimation can then be obtained by
measuring market activity around the packages embedding the
exploit. These results can be factored in current best practices for
vulnerability risk management and exploit mitigation [31, 51, 74].
Vulnerability economics. Previous studies in the literature high-
lighted the operations of criminal markets for drugs, arms and
pornography [69], and for the monetization of stolen information
resulting from an attack [36]. However, little insight exists on the
markets that, as opposed to (re)selling the result of an attack, trade
the technology that enables the attack in the first place. A few esti-
mates exist [1], but are mostly based on 0-day price allegations, vary
widely, and their relevance for the overall risk of attack remains un-
clear [18, 63]. The scientific community long discussed on the idea
of building ‘legitimate vulnerability markets’ [14, 46, 57], and the re-
sult is the institution of a few legitimate exploit markets [63] and of
several ‘bug bounty’ initiatives that reward security researchers for
the disclosure of new vulnerabilities [30], and discourage the partic-
ipation in the underground economy. In this vein it is interesting to
observe that the prices of modern bug-bounty programs are in line
or below those we identify on RuMarket. For example, [30, Tab. 4
pp281] reports that the majority of vulnerability prizes awarded by
Google in their Chrome Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) are
at or below 1000 USD, and that most external contributors to the
program (i.e. vulnerability researchers) earn between 500 and 1000
US dollars. The median price of an exploit in RuMarket, showed in
Table 6, is at approximately 2000 dollars, a higher but not distant fig-
ure from those indicated in [30]. It is however unclear whether the
resulting balance weighs in favour of the legitimate or underground
vulnerability markets: the dynamics balancing vulnerability finding
(a notoriously demanding process [52]) and exploitation trade have
not been fully investigated in the literature yet. For example, at
the above rates it does not seem unlikely that vendors who sell
their exploits multiple times to different buyers may still be better
off participating in the cybercrime economy than moving to the
‘legitimate’ vulnerability markets, as in the latter vulnerabilities can
realistically be traded only once (as the trade creates an association
between the ‘0-day’ vulnerability and identity of whom discovered
it). The results in this paper represent a first building block in the
evaluation and enhancement of current legitimate vulnerability
markets, to foster the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and
attract skillful researchers away from criminal markets.
Our exploit price estimates provide additional insights on the
effect of different criminal business models on exploit pricing and,
therefore, accessibility of attack. With reference to Tab. 14 in the
Appendix, and despite the upwards bias of the estimate (Eq. 2), EKIT
exploits are priced, per unit, significantly below exploits in other
package types. This effect is driven by the higher number of exploits
bundled in EKIT (ref. Table 3), and underlines how the different busi-
ness model employed by EKIT services may allow exploit vendors
to drastically reduce exploit development and deployment costs.
Lower prices may make these tools more accessible to ‘wanna-
be-criminals’, and therefore generate more attacks overall. This
suggests that the criminal business model may play a central role
in the diffusion of cyber-attacks, and calls for additional studies
characterizing this effect. Further, we find that the studied market
shows clear signs of expansion, with a growing number of vendors,
exploits, attack products, and generally inflating package prices.
This indicates that market activity is unlikely to stop in the near
future, and that attacker economics will likely play an increasingly
more relevant role in the cybersecurity scenario.
6 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we presented the first quantitative account of exploit
pricing and market effects on exploitation in the wild. Our findings
quantify a strong correlation between market activities and likeli-
hood of exploit. We find that the analyzed market shows signs of
expansion, and that exploit-as-a-service models may allow for dras-
tic cuts in exploit development costs. Further, we find that exploit
prices are aligned with or above those of ‘legitimate’ vulnerability
markets, supporting work on the identification of incentives for
responsible vulnerability disclosure and attack economics.
