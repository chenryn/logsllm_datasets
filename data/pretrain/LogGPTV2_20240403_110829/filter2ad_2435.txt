## Abstract
"Privacy by Design" (PbD) represents a philosophical shift from the traditional legal-oriented approach to privacy, toward a more proactive, technical, and embedded methodology. Despite its promise, PbD lacks a coherent set of systematic techniques for implementation. This gap is partly due to the failure to effectively leverage and organize existing methods, as well as the need to develop new approaches to address the complexities of modern socio-technical systems. This tutorial aims to survey the current state of PbD and outline the steps required to transform it into a structured and actionable framework.

## 1. Audience
This tutorial is intended for individuals interested in PbD as a practical, technical approach rather than a purely philosophical one.

## 2. What is Privacy?
Defining broad, high-level types of privacy has been challenging, with no universal agreement. However, there is general consensus that the concept of informational privacy, particularly in the context of information technology, holds significant value.

## 3. What is Privacy by Design?
The concept of PbD is closely associated with Ann Cavoukian [1], whose office has produced numerous working papers on the subject. Various related efforts, not always explicitly labeled as PbD, include work on "engineering privacy" [3]. While these efforts share commonalities, such as a foundation in Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) [2], there is considerable variation in their approaches.

## 4. Privacy by Design Case Studies
Case studies presented as examples (and even exemplars) of PbD in action highlight both a lack of consistent method and an absence of mechanisms for establishing such methods. We will review several of these studies, covering topics such as smart grids, location tracking, and near-field communications.

## 5. Theoretical Foundations of Privacy by Design
To the extent that theoretical foundations for PbD exist, they are primarily based on the FIPPs. We will examine some of the issues with FIPPs and other related concepts, such as identity and information leakage. We will also discuss how to address the gaps they represent, especially in light of the increasingly blurry notion of informational privacy.

## 6. Privacy by Design Methods
Existing systematic methods for PbD are rooted in the theoretical foundations described above and/or in specific technologies. These methods provide ways to map FIPPs onto systems and analyze or address risks related to identity and information leakage. They include several standards-based approaches.

## 7. Evolving Privacy by Design
For PbD to be more than just a philosophy, it needs a body of general, structured, and systematic methods. Both analytical and instrumental methods are necessary. We will discuss examples of each.
