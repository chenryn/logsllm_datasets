4.  PRIVACY BY DESIGN CASE STUDIES 
The  case  studies  that  are  put  forward  as  examples  (and  even 
exemplars) of PbD in action highlight both a poverty of consistent 
method and an absence of mechanisms for establishing methods. 
We will review a number of these studies, covering topics such as 
smart grid, location tracking, and near field communications.  
5.  PRIVACY BY DESIGN THEORETICAL 
FOUNDATIONS 
To  the  extent  that  theoretical  foundations  for  PbD  exist,  they 
center on the FIPPs. We will consider some problems with FIPPs 
and  other 
identity  and 
information  leakage  and  how  we  might  address  the  gaps  they 
represent, 
especially 
increasingly  blurry  notion  of 
informational privacy. 
6.  PRIVACY BY DESIGN METHODS 
To the extent systematic methods for PbD exist, they are rooted in 
the  theoretical  foundations  described  above  and/or  in  specific 
technologies. They provide ways of mapping FIPPs onto systems 
and  of  analyzing  and/or  addressing  identity  and  leakage  related 
risk, and include several standards-based approaches. 
7.  EVOLVING PRIVACY BY DESIGN 
Ultimately, if PbD is going to amount to more than a philosophy, 
it will need a body of general structured systematic methods. Both 
analytical  and  instrumental  methods  will  be  needed.  We  will 
discuss examples of each.

ABSTRACT 
“Privacy  by  design”  (PbD)  represents  a  distinct  philosophical 
movement  and  a  shift  away  from  the  dominant  legal-oriented 
approach  to  privacy  and  toward  an  approach  that  is  more 
proactive, technical, and embedded. However, it suffers from the 
general absence of organized systematic techniques for carrying it 
out.  In  part,  this  gap  reflects  a  failure  to  appropriately  leverage 
and  organize  existing  ideas  and  methods,  but  it  also  reflects  the 
need 
the 
complexities of new socio-technical systems. This tutorial aims to 
survey the state of PbD and what will be required to move it into 
the realm of actionable and structured techniques.

1.  AUDIENCE 
This tutorial is aimed at anyone interested in Privacy by Design 
(PbD) as a technical as opposed to a philosophical movement.  
2.  WHAT IS PRIVACY? 
Even  so  modest  a  goal  as  defining  broad,  high-level  types  of 
privacy  has  not  met  with  unanimity,  though  there  appears  to  be 
general  agreement  that  the  notion  of  informational  privacy—
principally  associated  with  information  technology—has  at  least 
some utility. 
3.  WHAT IS PRIVACY BY DESIGN? 
The  concept  of  PbD  is  closely  associated  with  Cavoukian  [1], 
whose office has produced numerous working papers devoted to 
it. A range of related efforts, not always explicitly invoking PbD, 
can  be  identified,  including  one  explicitly  on  “engineering 
privacy” [3]. While there are certain commonalities across all of 
these—most  notably  a  grounding  in  Fair  Information  Practice 
Principles (FIPPs) [2]—there is considerable variation.
