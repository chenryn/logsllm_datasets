### Simulation Cycles and Soft Errors

In the context of simulation cycles, those in which soft errors are not active are considered normal executions. Similarly, the cycles associated with the rollback exception routine are also treated as normal executions.

### Changes in MTBF under Various SER of Random Logic Circuits

In the simulations, soft errors were randomly injected into all flip-flops (F/Fs) of the random logic circuits of both microcontrollers, Original and GEN-MCU. Three soft error rates (SER) were defined: 10−3 per cycle (ER-3), 10−4 per cycle (ER-4), and 10−5 per cycle (ER-5), based on the work of Sugihara et al. [7]. These rates are accelerated for short-term evaluation. In terms of failure in time (FIT), ER-5 corresponds to about 5 × 10^17 FIT per Mbits from the sum of F/F bits included in the microcontroller. Simulations were run until the total simulation cycle reached approximately 100 million cycles.

### MTBF Analysis

- **ER-3**: The soft error-active rates in the Original microcontroller were 5-6%, while in GEN-MCU, they were 5-9%. The MTBF was 0.88 times that of the Original, primarily due to rollback misses caused by soft errors in the rollback exception routine.
- **ER-4**: The sum of simulation failures decreased, and the MTBF was 7.63 times longer than that of the Original, as shown in Figure 12.
- **ER-5**: The MTBF was 30 times longer. The "puwmod01" benchmark in GEN-MCU never experienced a simulation failure, so it was omitted from the MTBF calculation in Figure 13.

### Rollback Routine Duration

The rollback routine requires approximately 0.90 or 0.45 µs at frequencies of 100 or 200 MHz, respectively. These durations are relatively short for the control term of X-by-Wire systems. Given that the actual environment has a much lower SER, the likelihood of multiple soft errors occurring in a short period is negligible. Therefore, when implementing in real-time control systems, we should allow at most one rollback routine term within the system's control term.

### Rollback Enable Area Restrictions

- **(a) Rollback enable area of "Only_CPUD"**
- **(b) Rollback enable area of "Except_RCM"**

### Conclusion

The rollback architecture can output a rollback miss signal to external devices when rollback is impossible, reducing the possibility of a system crash. The detailed MTBF results and figures demonstrate the effectiveness of the GEN-MCU in handling soft errors under various SER conditions.
