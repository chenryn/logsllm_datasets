soft errors are not active as normal executions. The cy-
cles of the rollback exception routine also are normal ex-
ecutions.

4.2.1. Changes of MTBF under various SER of random
Original GEN-MCU
logic circuits
In the following simulations, soft errors were injected at
random to all F/Fs of the random logic circuits of both mi-
crocontrollers, Original and GEN-MCU. We deﬁned three
SER of 10−3 per cycle, 10−4 per cycle, and 10−5 per cycle
in reference to the work of Sugihara et al. [7]. Hereafter,
these three rates are called ”ER-3”, ”ER-4”, and ”ER-5”.
Note that these are accelerated rates for short-term evalua-
tion. In terms of the failure in time (FIT), ER-5 corresponds
to about 5 × 1017 FIT per Mbits from the sum of F/F bits
that are included in this microcontroller. Soft error injection
simulations were run until the maximum total simulation
cycle reached about 100 million cycles.
Detailed MTBF results are shown in Table 2, and the
GEN-MCU results are highlighted. Figures 11, 12, and 13
are MTBF graphs calculated by formula (2) from the sum
of the eight benchmarks. With ER-3, the soft error-active
rates were 5-6% in Original. Meanwhile, in GEN-MCU,
the soft error-active rates were 5-9% and the MTBF was

0.88 times, because the primary cause of failure was roll-
back miss caused by soft errors occurring in the rollback
exception routine. If the SER of evaluation was too high,
we would not be able to simulate an actual operating envi-
ronment and the rollback architecture would not be very ef-
fective. However, the rollback architecture can output a roll-

sible, reducing the possibility of a system crash. At ER-4,
the sum of simulation failures decreased and the MTBF was
7.63 times longer than that of Original, as shown in Figure
12. Finally, at ER-5, MTBF was 30 times longer. Here, the
”puwmod01” benchmark result of GEN-MCU never went
into simulation failure in this evaluation cycle. Therefore,
we omitted the puwmod01 benchmark from the MTBF cal-
culation in Figure 13.
For about 90 CPU cycles, the rollback routine requires
0.90 or 0.45 µs at frequencies of 100 or 200 MHz, respec-
tively. These rollback exception terms would be quite short
for the control term of X-by-Wire systems. SER is much
lower in the actual environment than in this evaluation envi-
ronment, and we expect that the possibility of two or more
soft errors occurring in a short period is negligible. There-
fore, when we implement to the actual real-time control sys-
tems, we should allow at most a rollback routine term in the
control term of the system.
