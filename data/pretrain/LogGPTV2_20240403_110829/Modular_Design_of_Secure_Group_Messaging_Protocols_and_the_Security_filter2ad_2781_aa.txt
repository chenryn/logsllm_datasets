## Abstract
The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) project is an IETF initiative aimed at establishing an industry-wide standard for secure group messaging (SGM). Supported by several major secure-messaging providers with a combined user base in the billions, MLS has evolved through multiple iterations to become a complex, yet relatively ad-hoc cryptographic protocol. Previous analyses of MLS have focused on sub-protocols, particularly continuous group key agreement (CGKA), but a comprehensive security analysis of the full MLS protocol has been lacking.

In this work, we address this gap by formally capturing the security of SGM protocols through a security game parameterized by a safety predicate that characterizes the achieved security level. We then present MLS as an SGM protocol, showing how it can be modularly constructed from three main components:
1. CGKA,
2. Forward-secure group authenticated encryption with associated data (FS-GAEAD), a new primitive,
3. PRF-PRNG, a two-input hash function that acts as a pseudorandom function (resp. generator) in its first (resp. second) input.

The security predicate for MLS's SGM security is defined purely in terms of the security predicates of these underlying primitives, allowing for component substitution while maintaining security. We provide instantiations of all these primitives, including proving the adaptive security of MLS's TreeKEM sub-protocol and introducing a novel FS-GAEAD construction adopted by MLS.

Additionally, we introduce new techniques, primitives, and results with broader applications, such as extending the Generalized Selective Decryption (GSD) proof technique to prove adaptive security for RTreeKEM, a more secure CGKA protocol.

## 1. Introduction
End-to-end encrypted asynchronous secure group messaging (SGM) is one of the most widely used cryptographic applications, with billions of daily users. The IETF is finalizing the standardization of the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) SGM protocol, led by industry (e.g., Cloudflare, Cisco, Facebook, Google, Mozilla, Twitter, Wickr, and Wire) with significant academic input. MLS is expected to be widely deployed in the coming years.

Due to its feature set and multifaceted security goals, MLS is complex and monolithic. Formal analyses of MLS have often been limited in scope, focusing on subsets of the protocol, particularly continuous group key agreement (CGKA). First introduced by Cohn-Gordon et al. [13] (as "Group Ratcheting"), CGKA is believed to encapsulate the essence of building SGM, similar to how key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) capture the essence of public-key encryption (PKE).

### Our Contributions
From a practical perspective, our primary contribution is a rigorous security proof showing that the basic instantiation of MLS is an SGM protocol. We validate the folklore claim that CGKA embodies the essence of SGM, making progress in describing and defining security for such protocols.

#### Black-Box Construction
We provide a black-box construction of an SGM protocol from a passively secure CGKA and other primitives. This construction, when instantiated appropriately, recovers the basic SGM protocol in MLS. Besides passive CGKA, we introduce a new primitive called Forward Secure Group AEAD (FS-GAEAD), which combines a forward-secure key schedule with an authenticated encryption scheme. We also abstract the key schedule of an FS-GAEAD with a new primitive called a Forward Secure KDF (FS-KDF), which supports the derivation of keys in any order. Our efficient FS-KDF construction has replaced the original in the MLS standard.

#### History Graphs
We introduce the first formal security notion for SGM, ensuring correctness, privacy, and authenticity in the form of post-compromise forward secrecy (PCFS). To manage the complexity, we developed the history graph (HG) paradigm for defining the security of asynchronous group protocols like MLS and CGKA. This paradigm provides an intuitive and visual understanding of the security semantics, represented as an annotated graph. The security details are formalized as a predicate over the HG and a challenge message, indicating if the challenge is secure given the execution represented by the HG. This modular approach makes our SGM and CGKA definitions adaptable and comparable.

#### PKI
We provide a more accurate modeling of the PKI used by MLS. Unlike previous works, our PKI can be realized under assumptions more compatible with end-to-end security, using out-of-band mechanisms for long-term key authentication and untrusted key servers for ephemeral key distribution.

#### Security Proofs
Using our HG-based security notions, we prove the security of the black-box SGM protocol, validating the design of MLS and the folklore motivating CGKA protocols. We also show that TreeKEM, as specified in Draft 11 of MLS, is a passively secure CGKA according to our definition, improving on previous analyses by more accurately modeling the PKI and network adversary capabilities. Additionally, we prove that RTreeKEM is a passively secure CGKA by extending the GSD technique to account for updatable public-key encryption (UPKE).

### Related Work
The history graph paradigm was shared with other researchers before this work was published and has been used in subsequent studies [5, 6]. Symbolic representations of executions with safety predicates have been used in [2, 14]. The GSD proof technique, introduced by Panjwani [25] and generalized by Jafargholi et al. [19], was first applied to CGKA protocols in [1].

The most influential precursor to TreeKEM is the asynchronous ratchet tree (ART) protocol, introduced by Cohn-Gordon et al. [13], which focuses on adaptive security for static groups. ART uses an older technique called "Tree-based DH groups," which differs significantly from TreeKEM, as discussed in [3].
