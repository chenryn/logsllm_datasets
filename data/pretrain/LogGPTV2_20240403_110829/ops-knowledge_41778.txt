User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Finding all IP ranges belonging to a specific ISP I'm having an issue with a certain individual who keeps scraping my site in an aggressive manner; wasting bandwidth and CPU resources. I've already implemented a system which tails my web server access logs, adds each new IP to a database, keeps track of the number of requests made from that IP, and then, if the same IP goes over a certain threshold of requests within a certain time period, it's blocked via iptables. It may sound elaborate, but as far as I know, there exists no pre-made solution designed to limit a certain IP to a certain amount of bandwidth/requests.

This works fine for most crawlers, but an extremely persistent individual is getting a new IP from his/her ISP pool each time they're blocked. I would like to block the ISP entirely, but don't know how to go about it. 

Doing a whois on a few sample IPs, I can see that they all share the same "netname", "mnt-by", and "origin/AS". Is there a way I can query the ARIN/RIPE database for all subnets using the same mnt-by/AS/netname? If not, how else could I go about getting every IP belonging to this ISP?

Thanks.

Assistant: whois [IP address] (or whois -a [IP Address]) will usually give you a CIDR mask or an address range that belongs to the company/provider in question, but parsing the results is left as an exercise for the reader (there are at least 2 common whois output formats).

Note that such wholesale blocking can also potentially knock out legitimate users.  Before taking this approach you should contact the abuse desk at the ISP in question (usually listed in the whois information for their netblock or DNS domain, otherwise abuse@ is a good place to start) to see if the situation can be resolved diplomatically rather than technically.



Also note that there are some pre-made solutions to limit requests per second by IP - Check out mod-qos or your system's firewall/traffic shaping capibilities.
