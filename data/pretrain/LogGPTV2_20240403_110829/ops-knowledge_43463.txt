User: Like most Python developers, I typically keep a console window open with the Python interpreter running to test commands, dir() stuff, help() stuff, etc.
Like any console, after a while the visible backlog of past commands and prints gets to be cluttered, and sometimes confusing when re-running the same command several times.  I'm wondering if, and how, to clear the Python interpreter console.
I've heard about doing a system call and either calling cls on Windows or clear on Linux, but I was hoping there was something I could command the interpreter itself to do.
Note: I'm running on Windows, so Ctrl+L doesn't work.
Assistant: I am using Spyder (Python 2.7) and to clean the interpreter console I use either 
%clear  
that forces the command line to go to the top and I will not see the previous old commands.
or I click "option" on the Console environment and select "Restart kernel" that removes everything.
