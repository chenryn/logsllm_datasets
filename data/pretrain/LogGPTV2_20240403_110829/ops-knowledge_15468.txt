I currently use Eclipse with the PyDev plugin to write Python code, and I have been relying on Dropbox to synchronize my workspace. However, this method is far from ideal. I would like to transition to using GitHub (or another source control management platform) to upload and manage my code, allowing me to work on it from different locations. 

I have found many tutorials on this topic to be quite overwhelming, possibly because they are geared towards collaborative projects involving multiple programmers. Could anyone share their experience or recommend a straightforward tutorial that would help me set this up effectively?

**Response:**

I personally use Mercurial for version control. I chose it because it seemed more user-friendly, though it still has a learning curve. There is a Mercurial plugin available for Eclipse, which can make the integration smoother.

Before making any changes, I highly recommend backing up your current workspace and even your Eclipse configuration folder. This will ensure you can revert to your current setup if anything goes wrong.

If you decide to proceed with GitHub, here are some basic steps to get started:

1. **Create a GitHub Account:** If you don't already have one, sign up for a free account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

2. **Install Git:** Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). Git is the version control system that GitHub uses.

3. **Set Up SSH Keys (Optional but Recommended):** Generate an SSH key pair and add the public key to your GitHub account. This allows you to securely connect to GitHub without entering your password every time.

4. **Initialize a Repository in Your Local Workspace:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run `git init` to initialize a new repository.
   - Add your files to the repository with `git add .`.
   - Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.

5. **Create a Remote Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to push your local repository to the remote one. This usually involves running commands like:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin <remote-repository-url>
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

6. **Integrate with Eclipse:**
   - Install the EGit plugin for Eclipse.
   - Import your existing project into Eclipse.
   - Use the EGit plugin to clone, push, and pull changes from your GitHub repository.

These steps should help you get started with using GitHub for your Python projects. If you need more detailed guidance, the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en) and the [EGit User Guide](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/documentation/) are excellent resources.

Good luck, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
