User: I use eclipse to write python codes using pydev. So far I have been using dropbox to synchronize my workspace. 
However, this is far from ideal. I would like to use github (or another SCM platform) to upload my code so I can work with it from different places. 
However, I have found many tutorials kind of daunting... Maybe because they are ready for projects shared between many programers
Would anyone please share with me their experience on how to do this? Or any basic tutorial to do this effectively?
Thanks
Assistant: I use mercurial. I picked it because it seemed easier. But is is only easiER.
There is mercurial eclipse plugin.
Save a copy of your workspace and maybe your eclipse folder too before daring it :)
