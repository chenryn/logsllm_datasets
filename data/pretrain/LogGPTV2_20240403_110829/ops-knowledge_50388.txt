User: This is a really annoying problem. I've prowled the web for solutions, but all I found was tips about changing the PATH variable, which I did, of course. My Python install directory is C:\Python27. It' a 32 bit version. Whenever I type python in the command prompt, it says that it isn't recognised as an internal or external command. Currently, my PATH variable is set to C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python27\Scripts. Anyone has any ideas? I run Windows 7 by the way (64 bit). I'm pretty desperate. Heck, if nothing works I guess I'll try dual-booting Linux and Windows 7...
Assistant: After adding the python folder to the system PATH variable, you should reboot your computer.
Another simple solution is: create a shortcut of the python.exe executable (probably it is in C:\Python27\python.exe, or similar) in a place like C:\Windows\system32 (that is, a place that already is listed in the PATH variable). The name of your shortcut should be python (maybe python.exe should work too). I mean, it can't be python - shortcut or similar, for your purposes.
To see the contents of the PATH variable, go to the cmd and enter set PATH.
