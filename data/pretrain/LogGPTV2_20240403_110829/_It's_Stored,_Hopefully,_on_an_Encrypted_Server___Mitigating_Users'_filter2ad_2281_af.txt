### Participants' Perception of Account Creation Difficulty

Participants reported that the account creation process suggested by Biometric-Brands was more challenging compared to the other four notifications (all p ≤ .047). Specifically, 40% of participants felt that creating an account would be "extremely easy" after viewing the Biometric-Brands notification, while between 46% and 55% of participants felt the same after viewing the other notifications.

### Relative Rankings of Notifications

When asked to rank the five notifications (refer to Figure 6c), a plurality of participants (28%) ranked Biometric-Leaves as the best. Additionally, 51% of participants ranked Biometric-Leaves either first or second, and the smallest fraction (11%) ranked it last. The next highest ranking was for Biometric-Stored, which 20% of participants ranked first, and 48% ranked either first or second. No other notification was ranked either first or second by more than 39% of participants. In contrast, 40% of participants ranked Biometric-Brands last. The differences in rankings were statistically significant (Friedman χ²(4) = 51.1, p < .001). Biometric-Leaves, Biometric-Stored, and Biometric-Shared were ranked higher than Biometric-Brands (all p < .001) and Biometric-Hacked (all p ≤ .046). Biometric-Hacked was also ranked higher than Biometric-Brands (p = .046).

### Preference for Biometric WebAuthn Over Passwords

We inquired about the types of websites on which participants would prefer to use biometric login over passwords. Only 5% of participants did not select any of the listed websites. In contrast, 87% indicated they would use biometric login on banking websites, 62% for email, and between 48% and 56% for work, social media, shopping, and education websites. When asked about non-biometric WebAuthn, 34% of participants did not select any of the listed websites. For each website, between 27% and 40% of participants would use non-biometric WebAuthn.

If given a choice between biometric sign-in and a password for ExampleTech, 66% of participants were "extremely likely" to choose biometric sign-in, with an additional 22% being "somewhat likely." Only 10% were "somewhat" or "extremely unlikely" to do so. This likelihood varied across groups (Kruskal-Wallis χ²(7) = 20.3, p = .013). While 89% to 95% of participants in the biometric conditions were likely to choose biometric sign-in, only 70% of Non-biometric and 69% of Password participants responded similarly. These results suggest that a single experience with biometric WebAuthn increases the likelihood of adoption.

### Perceived Security of Biometrics

While 75% of participants felt that passwords were "slightly" or "much less secure" than biometric sign-in, only 10% felt that passwords were "slightly" or "much more secure." Comparing fingerprint and face biometrics, 33% of participants felt they were equally secure, while 58% felt that face biometrics were less secure than fingerprints. When comparing their non-biometric unlock mechanism to a site-specific password, 51% of participants felt their unlock mechanism was less secure. This result was heavily influenced by the misconception that guessing the PIN or pattern was sufficient for gaining access. Note that with WebAuthn, physical access to the phone is also required.

### Trustworthiness of Websites

Due to misconceptions about biometric storage, we observed a large gap in participants' willingness to register with biometric WebAuthn on trustworthy versus untrustworthy websites. While 86% of participants were "extremely" or "somewhat likely" to use biometric WebAuthn on trusted websites, only 24% answered the same for untrusted websites. However, because only a site-specific public key is transferred, registering on a potentially untrustworthy website with WebAuthn does not actually put the user at risk. In fact, it is safer to register at untrustworthy websites with WebAuthn rather than a (potentially reused) password.

### Discussion

#### Key Misconceptions About Biometric WebAuthn

Participants perceived biometric WebAuthn as more secure than passwords. However, they often tried to infer how this new authentication system worked based on their existing knowledge about passwords and phone unlocking. While some misconceptions (e.g., availability concerns) are well-established in the literature, we identified new issues specific to biometric WebAuthn. The most urgent misconception is the belief that biometric data is stored on the website. Our results show a clear usability advantage of biometric over non-biometric WebAuthn (PIN, pattern, or password). Participants were surprised by how easy and fast the account creation and login process was. We recommend that services emphasize the ease and speed of use when communicating with end users.

#### Impact of Notifications

The notifications we tested to address misconceptions were impactful. Specifically, Biometric-Leaves and Biometric-Stored increased the fraction of participants who correctly reported that their biometric is stored on the device from one-third up to one-half. However, a single, brief notification is not enough to fully address this issue. Users will need more education on where their biometric data is stored.

#### Previous Work and Recommendations

Our findings confirm previous work by Lyastani et al. [32], Farke et al. [18], and Takakuwa [54] on using WebAuthn with hardware security keys. We also identified problems specific to biometric WebAuthn, such as storage, processing, transferability across multiple devices, and delegating access, which should be addressed for successful large-scale deployment.

#### FIDO2/WebAuthn Implementation Issues

Different vendors' implementations of the WebAuthn "Verify your identity" screen can create significant usability hurdles. The interface varies depending on the OS version, hardware vendor, biometric sensor position, UI appearance settings, and configured fallback scheme. Online services can influence the appearance by configuring authenticator attachment selection criteria.

#### Recommendations and Takeaways

- **For Services Implementing Biometric WebAuthn:**
  - Explicitly state that biometric data is not sent to or stored by the website.
  - Emphasize the speed and ease of biometric authentication.
  - Focus on the convenience of WebAuthn rather than comparing it to passwords.

- **For Researchers:**
  - Aim to solve impediments to adoption, such as transferability across devices and delegating access.
  - Move beyond notifications and study richer interactions, such as short videos, to counteract lingering misconceptions.

#### Limitations

Our studies have several limitations. Responses may suffer from social desirability and response bias. To mitigate this, we did not explain that this was a study about usability or security, and we reminded participants that people might have many different opinions. We adhered to best practices, such as keeping questions short and clear, randomization, and piloting. Our studies are based on convenience samples, which limits their ecological validity. Participants were relatively young, well-educated, and a fraction had an IT background. Additionally, our recruitment criteria included only those who unlock their phones using biometrics, which may include a less privacy-concerned population.

#### Future Work

Biometrics can be used for authentication in various contexts, including unlocking devices and within apps. We scoped our studies to web authentication and mobile devices. Future research should explore the differences in mental models between biometric usage within apps and on websites. Additionally, design factors like icons, colors, notification style, and personalization could significantly influence the effectiveness of notifications. Further exploration of design patterns and richer interactions is needed to encourage WebAuthn adoption.

### Conclusion

In this work, we studied misconceptions surrounding FIDO2 WebAuthn using biometrics. An online study with 42 crowdworkers revealed that 67% incorrectly thought their biometrics were transmitted to the website. In co-design sessions, we developed short-form notifications to mitigate these misconceptions. A 345-participant online study showed that notifications focusing on the storage location of biometric data were most effective. Despite this, key misconceptions partially persisted. However, participants indicated a high interest in adopting biometric WebAuthn over non-biometric WebAuthn and passwords.
