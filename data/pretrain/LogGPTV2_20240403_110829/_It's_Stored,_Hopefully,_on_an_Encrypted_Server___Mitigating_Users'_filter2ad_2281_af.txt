Participants felt that Biometric-Brands suggested account cre-
ation was more difﬁcult than for the other four notiﬁcations
(all p ≤ .047). Whereas 40% of participants felt creating an
account would be “extremely easy” after viewing Biometric-
Brands, between 46% and 55% felt the same after viewing
the other notiﬁcations.

Figure 6: Participants’ relative perceptions and rankings of biometric WebAuthn notiﬁcations (within-subjects).
When asked to rank these 5 notiﬁcations (cf. Figure 6c),
a plurality of participants (28%) ranked Biometric-Leaves
ﬁrst. Furthermore, 51% of participants ranked Biometric-
Leaves ﬁrst or second, and the smallest fraction (11%) ranked
it last. Next best, Biometric-Stored was ranked ﬁrst by 20%
of participants, and either ﬁrst or second by 48%. No other
notiﬁcation was ranked either ﬁrst or second by more than
39% of participants. In contrast, 40% of participants ranked
Biometric-Brands last. Differences in rankings were signiﬁ-
cant (Friedman χ2(4) = 51.1, p < .001). Biometric-Leaves,
Biometric-Stored, and Biometric-Shared were ranked higher
than Biometric-Brands (all p < .001) and Biometric-Hacked
(all p ≤ .046). Biometric-Hacked was itself ranked higher
than Biometric-Brands (p = .046).
5.8 Choosing Biometric WebAuthn
Biometric WebAuthn Preferred Over Passwords: We
asked participants to select types of websites on which they
would “choose to use a biometric login. . . over a password.”
Only 5% of participants did not select any of the listed web-
sites. In contrast, 87% indicated they would do so on banking
websites, 62% for email, and between 48% and 56% for work,
social media, shopping, and education websites. In contrast,
when we asked a parallel question about non-biometric Web-
Authn, 34% of participants did not select any of the listed
websites. For each website, between 27% and 40% of partici-
pants would use non-biometric WebAuthn.
If given a choice between biometric sign-in and a password
for ExampleTech, 66% of participants were “extremely likely”
to choose biometric sign-in, while an additional 22% were
“somewhat likely” to do so. Only 10% were “somewhat” or
“extremely unlikely” to do so. This likelihood varied across
groups (KW χ2(7) = 20.3, p = .013). Whereas 89% to 95%
of participants in the biometric conditions were likely to do so,
only 70% of Non-biometric and 69% of Password participants
responded the same. These results suggest a single experience
with biometric WebAuthn makes adoption more likely.
Biometrics Considered More Secure: While 75% of par-
ticipants felt passwords were “slightly” or “much less se-
cure” than biometric sign-in, only 10% felt passwords were
“slightly” or “much more secure.” Comparing ﬁngerprint and
face biometrics, 33% of participants felt they were equally
secure, while 58% felt face was less secure than ﬁngerprint.
Comparing their non-biometric unlock mechanism to a site-
speciﬁc password, 51% of participants felt their unlock mech-
anism was less secure than a site-speciﬁc password. This
result was heavily inﬂuenced by the misconception that guess-
ing the PIN or pattern was sufﬁcient for gaining access. Note
that with WebAuthn, physical access to the phone would also
be required.
Website Trustworthiness: Due to misconceptions about
biometric storage, we found a large gap between participants’
willingness to register with biometric WebAuthn on trustwor-
thy and untrustworthy websites. Whereas 86% of participants
were “extremely” or “somewhat likely” to use biometric Web-
Authn on trusted websites, only 24% answered the same for
untrusted websites. Because only a site-speciﬁc public key is
transferred, registering on a potentially untrustworthy web-
site with WebAuthn does not actually put the user at risk. In
fact, it is far safer to register at untrustworthy websites with
WebAuthn rather than a (potentially reused) password.
6 Discussion
Key Misconceptions About Biometric WebAuthn: Our
participants perceived biometric WebAuthn as more secure
than passwords. However, we observed that participants tried
to infer how this new authentication system worked based on
their existing knowledge about passwords and phone unlock-
ing. While some misconceptions participants expressed (e.g.,
availability concerns) are well-established in the literature,
we identiﬁed new issues speciﬁc to biometric WebAuthn. The
most urgent and salient misconception we identiﬁed in the
context of WebAuthn is where users believe their biometrics
are stored. The fraction of participants we observed reporting
that their biometric data is sent to ExampleTech is alarming.
Thus, when deploying WebAuthn with support for local bio-
metric authentication, such as on mobile devices and some
security keys, we urge services to address this misconception.
Our results show a clear usability advantage of biometric
over non-biometric WebAuthn (PIN, pattern, or password).
Our participants were surprised by how easy and fast the
account creation and login process was. Due to the value
participants placed on ease and speed of use, we also suggest
services emphasize this when communicating with end users.

impactful. In particular, Biometric-Leaves and Biometric-
Stored increased the fraction of participants who correctly
reported that their biometric is stored on the device from one-
third up to one-half. Still, a single, brief notiﬁcation is not
enough to address this fundamental issue. Users will need
more education on where their biometric is stored.
In regards to previous work by Lyastani et al. [32], Farke
et al. [18], and Takakuwa [54] about using WebAuthn with
hardware security keys, our work conﬁrms their ﬁndings (re-
covery, lost authenticators, revocation, and mental models),
but has also identiﬁed problems (storage, processing, trans-
ferability across multiple devices, and delegating access) that
are speciﬁc to biometric WebAuthn and should be addressed
to make the large-scale deployment of WebAuthn a success.
FIDO2/WebAuthn Implementation Issues: As already
touched upon in previous work [40], we identiﬁed vendors’
different implementations of the WebAuthn “Verify your iden-
tity” screen (cf. Figure 1b) to be a major usability hurdle. De-
pending on the OS version, hardware vendor, biometric sensor
position (i.e., back of the phone or in-display), UI appearance
settings (light or dark), and conﬁgured knowledge-based fall-
back scheme (i.e., PIN, pattern, or password) the interface is
very different. Online services can inﬂuence the appearance
as well by conﬁguring an authenticator attachment selection
criteria (i.e., no preference, platform, cross-platform) that
allows user to select an external (roaming) authenticator such
as a USB, NFC, or Bluetooth hardware security key or not.
Recommendations and Takeaways: The notiﬁcations
our participants developed were centered around addressing
misconceptions. Speciﬁc to biometric WebAuthn, we found
that users’ mental models differ substantially from other use
cases on mobile devices, like phone unlocking. Our par-
ticipants explicitly pointed out that they could unlock their
phone with biometrics even without a data connection, so the
biometric must be stored locally. In contrast, we observed
that participants commonly applied their mental model for
password-based sign-in, concluding that their biometric must
be transmitted to the website as a password would. Compared
to eBay’s notiﬁcation (cf. Figure 1a), which motivates users
by focusing on the weaknesses of passwords, we recommend
focusing on the convenience of WebAuthn instead.
Services implementing biometric WebAuthn should:
• Explicitly say that biometric data is not sent to, nor stored
by, the website.
• Emphasize biometric authentication’s speed and ease.
• Focus on WebAuthn’s convenience, rather than compar-
ing it to passwords.
Researchers should:
• Aim to solve impediments to adoption (e.g., transferabil-
ity across devices [54], delegating access)
• Move beyond notiﬁcations and study richer interactions
(e.g., short videos [32]) aiming to counteract lingering
misconceptions (e.g., where biometrics are stored).
Limitations: Our studies have a number of limitations.
Responses from our participants may suffer from a social
desirability and response bias. To mitigate this, we did not
explain that this was a study about usability or security, and
we reminded our participants that people might have many
different opinions. Like many human-subject studies, there
is always the potential for a bias in question wording. To
avoid this, we adhered to best practices [47] like keeping the
questions short and clear, randomization, and piloting. All
questionnaires we used can be found online [31]. As in previ-
ous work [32], we relied on a controllable artiﬁcial account
setting, so our notiﬁcations have not been tested with real-
world services. Most importantly, our studies are limited by
our recruitment method using Proliﬁc. Prior work [48] sug-
gests that online studies about security and privacy behavior
can approximate behaviors of populations well. Our studies
are based on convenience samples, so they are inherently
limited in their ecological validity. Participants were rather
young, well-educated, and a fraction reported having an IT
background. Most notably, due to our recruitment criteria,
our study only included people that unlock their phone using
biometrics, which might include a less privacy-concerned pop-
ulation and inﬂuence the responses towards a more positive
perception of biometric authentication.
Future Work: Biometrics can be used for authentication
on mobile devices in many contexts other than websites, in-
cluding unlocking the device or within apps (e.g., online bank-
ing apps or password managers). We intentionally scoped
our studies to web authentication and only relied on mobile
devices as they offered the easiest-to-control study environ-
ment [20]. Nevertheless, users’ mental models may differ
between these contexts, and we consider studying the dif-
ference between biometric usage within apps compared to a
website context important future work. Moreover, research
on the design of warnings has shown that design factors like
icons, colors, notiﬁcation style, or choice (such as providing
an alternative way for account creation) can signiﬁcantly in-
ﬂuence the notiﬁcation’s effectiveness. Promising UI designs
like personalization or opinionated nudging could also be eval-
uated. We therefore consider it meaningful to explore further
design patterns or richer interactions that more speciﬁcally
focus on encouraging WebAuthn adoption.
7 Conclusion
In this work, we studied misconceptions of FIDO2 WebAuthn
using biometrics. An online study with 42 crowdworkers re-
vealed that 67% incorrectly thought their biometrics were
transmitted to the website. In co-design sessions, we devel-
oped short-form notiﬁcations aiming to mitigate misconcep-
tions surrounding WebAuthn. Participants focused on secu-
rity, convenience, availability, and a comparison to (and em-
phasis of the drawbacks of) passwords. Via a 345-participant
online study where we compared notiﬁcations, we found that

notiﬁcations that focus on the storage location of the bio-
metric are most effective in counteracting misconceptions.
Nevertheless, key misconceptions partially persisted. How-
ever, participants indicated high interest in adopting biometric
WebAuthn over non-biometric WebAuthn and passwords.
