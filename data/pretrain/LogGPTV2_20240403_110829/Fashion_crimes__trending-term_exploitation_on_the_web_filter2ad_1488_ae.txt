Figure 7: MFA prevalence in the top 10 search results fell after
Google announced changes to its ranking algorithm on Febru-
ary 24, 2011, designed to counter “low-quality” results.
monthly revenue from malware of:
Rmal(1 month) = 48 975 × 1 × 0.0216 × 58 ≈ $61 356 .
Thus, malware sites (e.g., fake anti-virus sites) generate roughly
$60,000/month just from trending-term exploitation.
Here too, there are costs associated with deploying these sites,
but server maintenance is a lot cheaper than in the case of MFA
sites, given that most machines hosting malware have been com-
promised rather than purchased. Bots go for less than a dollar [5,
and references therein], while a compromised server (presumably
with high quality network access) goes at most for $25 according
to Franklin et al. [9]. Note that we do not adjust the returns on mal-
ware for the risk of being caught because the likelihood of being
arrested for cyber-criminal activity is currently negligible in many
jurisdictions where cyber-criminals operate.
One conclusion of this analysis is that malware and MFA hosting
have quite different revenue models, but yield surprisingly similar
amounts of money to their perpetrators. This lends further support
to the hypothesis that they could be treated as substitutes.
5. SEARCH-ENGINE INTERVENTION
On February 24, 2011, following a series of high-proﬁle reports
of manipulation of its search engine (e.g., [33, 34]), Google an-
nounced changes to its search ranking algorithm designed to eradi-
cate “low-quality” results [35]. Google deﬁned low-quality sites as
those which are “low-value add for users, copy content from other
websites or sites that are just not very useful.” The MFA sites ex-
amined in this paper certainly appear to match that deﬁnition. Be-
cause we were already collecting search results on the trending set,
we can measure the effectiveness of the intervention in eradicating
abuse targeting trending terms.
Figure 7 plots over time the average percentage of top 10 search
results marked as MFA for terms in the trending set. From July to
February, 3.1% of Google’s top 10 results (solid line) for trending
terms pointed to MFA sites, compared to 2.0% for Yahoo!’s top 10
results (dotted line). The vertical dashed line marks February 24,
2011, the day of Google’s announcement. The proportion of MFA
sites quickly fell, stabilizing a month later at a rate of 0.47% for
Google. Curiously, Yahoo!’s share of top 10 MFA results also fell,
to an average of 0.56%.
Landing in the top results tells only part of the story. The under-
lying popularity of the trending terms is also important. We com-
pute the estimated site visits to MFA sites, which is more directly
tied to revenue. Table 6 compares the number of visits referred to
Table 6: Estimated number of visits to MFA and malware sites
for trending terms.
by Google and Yahoo! search results before and after the interven-
tion. Between July 24, 2010 and February 24, 2011, MFA sites
attracted 4.67 million monthly visits on average. Between March
10 and April 24, 2011, the monthly rate fell 31% to 3.2 million.
However, the changes differed greatly across search engines. Re-
ferrals from Google search results fell by 47%, while on Yahoo!
and Bing the visits increased by 11%. The table also distinguishes
between whether the MFA site uses Google ads or another provider.
81% of MFA sites show Google ads, which is not surprising given
Google’s dominance in pay-per-click advertising.
It is an open
question whether Google might treat MFA sites hosting its own ads
differently than sites with other ads. Striking them from the search
results reduces Google’s own advertising revenue. However, it is in
Google’s interest to provide high-quality search results, the amount
of foregone revenue is small, and is likely to be partly replaced by
other search results. Our ﬁgures support the latter rationale. Sites
with Google ads fell by 1.2 million visits, or 41%. Visits to sites not
using AdSense fell by 91%, but, in absolute terms, the reduction
was smaller than for sites with Google ads. By contrast, Yahoo!
results with Google ads rose by 18%.
Using the pre- and post-intervention MFA visit rates into the
revenue equations developed in Section 4.2, the average monthly
take for MFA sites has fallen from $106 000 to $74 000. If this re-
duction holds over time, what are the implications for miscreants?
First, they may decide to devote more effort to manipulating Ya-
hoo! and Bing, despite their lower market penetration, since the
MFA revenues are growing more equitable in absolute terms. Sec-
ond, malware becomes more attractive as an alternative source of
revenue, so one unintended consequence of the intervention to im-
prove search quality could be to foster more overtly criminal activ-
ities harming consumers. Third, revenue models based on adver-
tising require volume, and external efforts that reduce trafﬁc levels
can cause signiﬁcant pain to the miscreant. By contrast, malware
offers substantially more expected revenue per visitor, and is there-
fore likely to be much more difﬁcult to eradicate.
Given the striking change in MFA prevalence following Google’s
intervention, it is worth checking whether this intervention alters
the signiﬁcance of the empirical conclusions reached in Section 3.4.
We included a dummy variable into the MFA regression reﬂecting
whether Google’s intervention had yet occurred, and found that this
inclusion does not alter the signiﬁcance of the dependent variables
presented in Section 3.4.
6. RELATED WORK
Our work inscribes itself in the body of literature on understand-
ing the underground online economy. Some of the early econo-
metric work in that domain revolves around quantities bartered in
underground forums [9], and on email spam campaigns [18, 22].
Grier et al. [10] extend this literature to Twitter spam. Along the
464same lines, Moore and Clayton have published a series of papers
characterizing phishing campaigns [25, 26, 27].
More recently, a number of papers have also started to investigate
web-based scams. Christin et al. [6] study a speciﬁc web-based so-
cial engineering scam (“one click fraud”). Provos et al. describe in
details how so called “drive-by-downloads” are used to automati-
cally install malware [30, 31]. Cova et al. [8] and Stone-Gross et
al. [36] focus on fake anti-virus malware, and provide estimates
of the amount of money they generate. Stone-Gross et al. cal-
culate, through recovery of the miscreants’ transactions logs, that
anti-virus campaigns gross between $3.8 and $48.4 million a year.
Afﬁliates funneling trafﬁc to miscreants get between $50,000 and
$1.8 million in over two months. These totals are markedly higher
than what we obtain, but they consider all possible sources of mal-
ware (botnets, search engine manipulation, drive-by-downloads)
whereas we only look at the much smaller subset of search engine
manipulation based on trending term exploitation.
A few recent works consider search engine manipulation. Leon-
tiadis et al. [20] investigate search engine manipulation to promote
potentially illicit online drugs. John et al. [17] present a case study
of recent search engine manipulation campaigns, conﬁrming that
trending-term exploitation is an attack vector of choice. They then
devise countermeasures to thwart search engine manipulation.
Our approach differs from the related work in that we focus on a
speciﬁc phenomenon – trending-term exploitation – by investigat-
ing how it is carried out (e.g., search-engine manipulation, Twitter
spam), as well as its purpose: malware distribution and moneti-
zation through advertisements. Our analysis thus sheds light on a
speciﬁc technique used by miscreants that search-engine operators
are battling to fend off.
7. CONCLUSION
We have undertaken a large-scale investigation into the abuse of
“trending” terms, focusing on the two primary methods of mone-
tization: malware and ads. We have found that the the dynamic
nature of the trends creates a narrow opportunity that is being effec-
tively exploited on web search engines and social-media platforms.
We have presented statistical evidence that the less popular and less
ﬁnancially lucrative terms are exploited most effectively, and that
the spoils of abuse are highly concentrated among a few players.
We have developed an empirically grounded model of the earnings
potential of both malware and ads, ﬁnding that each attracts aggre-
gate revenues on the order of $100 000 per month. Finally, we have
found that Google’s intervention to combat low-quality sites has
likely reduced revenues from trend exploitation by more than 30%.
There is a connection in our economic modeling to the battle
over how to proﬁt from typosquatting [28]. In both cases, Internet
“bottom feeders” seek to siphon off a fraction of legitimate trafﬁc at
large scale. Several years ago, typosquatting was used in phishing
attacks and to distribute malware. Today, however, typosquatting
is almost exclusively monetized through pay-per-click and afﬁliate
marketing ads [28], attracting hundreds of millions of dollars in
advertising revenue to domain squatters via ad platforms.
The open question is whether a signiﬁcant crackdown on, say,
fake antivirus sales, will simply shift the economics in favor of low-
quality advertising. However, while ad platforms might tolerate
placing ads on typosquatted websites, advertising that lowers the
quality of search results directly threatens the ad platform’s core
business of web search. Consequently, we are more optimistic that
search engines might be willing to crack down on all abuses of
trending terms, as we have found in our initial data analysis.
