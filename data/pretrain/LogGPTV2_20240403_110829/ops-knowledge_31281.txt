User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Observe the following logs
 0 20:10:53 INFO Partition rdd_6_2 not found, computing it
 1 20:11:07 INFO Partition rdd_42_8 not found, computing it
 2 20:10:53 INFO Partition rdd_11_1 not found, computing it
 3 20:10:46 INFO Partition rdd_2_4 not found, computing it
 4 20:10:46 INFO Partition rdd_2_2 not found, computing it
 5 20:10:56 INFO Partition rdd_26_0 not found, computing it
 6 20:10:55 INFO Partition rdd_21_1 not found, computing it
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: Partition rdd_<*> not found, computing it
B: Changing modify acls to: <*>
C: Registered signal handlers for [TERM, HUP, INT]
D: Changing view acls to: <*>
