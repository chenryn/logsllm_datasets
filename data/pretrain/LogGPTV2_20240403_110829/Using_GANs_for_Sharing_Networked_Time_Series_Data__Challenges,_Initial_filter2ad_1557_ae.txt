### Predicting Future Events and Time Series Analysis Using GANs

#### Introduction
The goal of this study is to predict whether an event \( E \) will occur in the future or to forecast the time series itself. For example, in the GCUT dataset, we aim to predict whether a particular job will complete successfully. This use case demonstrates that models trained on generated data can generalize to real data.

#### Methodology
1. **Dataset Partitioning**:
   - The dataset is partitioned as shown in Figure 12.
   - Real data is split into two equal sets: a training set \( A \) and a test set \( A' \).
   - A generative model (e.g., DoppelGANger or a baseline) is trained on set \( A \).
   - Synthetic datasets \( B \) and \( B' \) are generated for training and testing, respectively.

2. **Evaluation Setup**:
   - Event prediction algorithms are trained on \( A \) and/or \( B \), and tested on \( A' \) and/or \( B' \).
   - This setup allows us to compare the generalization abilities of the prediction algorithms within and across classes of data (real/generated).

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - We predict the task end event type (e.g., EVICT, KILL) from time series observations in the GCUT dataset.
   - Various algorithms are used for prediction: multilayer perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees, and linear SVM.
   - Figure 13 shows the test accuracy of each predictor when trained on generated data and tested on real data. DoppelGANger (DG) outperforms other baselines, achieving 43% higher accuracy than the next-best baseline (AR) and 80% of the real data accuracy.

#### Algorithm Comparison
- **Rank Correlation**:
  - We evaluate whether algorithm rankings are preserved on generated data by training different classifiers (MLP, SVM, Naive Bayes, decision tree, and logistic regression) to classify end event types.
  - This is also evaluated on the WWT dataset using different regression models (MLP, linear regression, and Kernel regression) for time series forecasting.
  - Table 5 shows the rank correlation of prediction algorithms on the GCUT and WWT datasets. DG and AR achieve the best rank correlations, but AR's minimal randomness leads to high accuracy, highlighting the importance of considering rank correlation with other fidelity metrics.

#### Case Studies
- **DoppelGANger (DG) Evaluation**:
  - DG is being evaluated by several independent users, including a large public cloud provider (IBM).
  - IBM has internally validated the fidelity of DG for generating resource usage measurements for different containers.
  - Figure 14 shows the learned distribution of containersâ€™ maximum CPU usage, demonstrating DG's ability to capture challenging distributions, even in the heavy tail.

#### Privacy Analysis and Tradeoffs
1. **Protecting Business Secrets**:
   - Data holders are concerned about leaking information about the types of resources available and in use.
   - Metadata obfuscation can be achieved by retraining the metadata generator to a desired distribution without requiring new time series data.
   - A major open question is how to realistically tune attribute distributions while maintaining the conditional distribution \( P(R_i|A_i) \).

2. **Protecting User Privacy**:
   - Differential privacy (DP) is a leading metric for measuring user privacy.
   - DP-GANs are explored to generate privacy-preserving time series, but they require significant improvements.
   - Membership inference attacks are another concern. Figure 15 shows that DG is robust to membership inference with larger training sets, suggesting a practical guideline: use more training data for better robustness.

#### Conclusions
- While DG is a promising workflow for data sharing, further research is needed to enhance the privacy properties of GANs.
- Networking datasets require more complexity than DG currently handles, such as causal interactions between stateful agents.
- Enabling "what-if" analysis for modeling changes in the underlying system and generating associated data is another direction of interest.
- Physical system modeling and simulation, combined with GANs, may help address these challenges.
