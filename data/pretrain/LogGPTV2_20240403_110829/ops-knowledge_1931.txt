**Documentation for Installing Perl Modules**

I have been tasked with documenting the installation process for a complex application on a clean server. Part of this application involves numerous Perl scripts, each requiring various Perl modules.

Given my limited knowledge of Perl, I currently know only one method to install these required modules. As a result, my documentation includes a long list of individual commands, such as:

```sh
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install JSON'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Simple'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Log::Log4perl'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Email::Simple'
...
```

This list continues for several pages, which is not ideal for the users who will be following this documentation.

### Simplifying the Installation Process

Is there a way to consolidate these installations into a single command, similar to how `aptitude` can install multiple packages at once? For example:

```sh
sudo aptitude install openssh-server libapache2-mod-perl2 build-essential ...
```

### Solution

The best approach is to use pre-packaged versions of the Perl modules if they are available in your distribution. For modules that are not packaged, you can create a Perl script to handle the installation. Here is an example script that uses CPANPLUS to install the required modules:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use CPANPLUS;

my $backend = CPANPLUS::Backend->new( conf => { prereqs => 1 } );
$backend->install(
    modules => [
        'Date::Simple',
        'File::Slurp',
        'LWP::Simple',
        'MIME::Base64',
        'MIME::Parser',
        'MIME::QuotedPrint',
        # Add other required modules here
    ]
);
```

Save this script as `installmodules.pl` and make it executable. You can then include a simple one-liner in your documentation:

```sh
sudo perl installmodules.pl
```

### Additional Notes

Before using CPAN, check if some or all of the required Perl modules are already available as pre-packaged versions for your distribution. This can significantly simplify the installation process.

Thank you for your help, on behalf of the many people who will be using this documentation.
