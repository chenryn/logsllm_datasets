User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题installing lots of perl modules I've been landed with the job of documenting how to install a very complicated application onto a clean server.  Part of the application requires a lot of perl scripts, each of which seem to require lots of different perl modules.
I don't know much about perl, and I only know one way to install the required modules.  This means my documentation now looks this:

Type each of these commands and accept all the defaults:
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install JSON'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Simple'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Log::Log4perl'
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Email::Simple'
(.... continues for 2 more pages... )


Is there any way I can do all this one line like I can with aptitude i.e.

Type the following command and go get a coffee:
sudo aptitude install openssh-server libapache2-mod-perl2 build-essential ...


Thank you (on behalf of the long suffering people who will be reading my document)

EDIT: The best way to do this is to use the packaged versions.  For the modules which were not packaged for Ubuntu 10.10 I ended up with a little perl script which I found here )
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use CPANPLUS;
    use strict;
    CPANPLUS::Backend-&gt;new( conf =&gt; { prereqs =&gt; 1 } )-&gt;install(
        modules =&gt; [ qw(
            Date::Simple
            File::Slurp
            LWP::Simple
            MIME::Base64
            MIME::Parser
            MIME::QuotedPrint
        ) ]
    );

This means I can put a nice one liner in my document:
sudo perl installmodules.pl

Assistant: Depending on your distribution, many perl modules may be already packaged.

Before using CPAN check if some/most/all of the needed packages are not already available for your distro.
