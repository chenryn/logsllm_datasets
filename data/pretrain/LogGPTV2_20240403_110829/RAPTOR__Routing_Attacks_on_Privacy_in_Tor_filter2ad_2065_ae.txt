Table 7: Asymmetric Trafﬁc Analysis accuracy rate
Fig. 13 shows an example of a client with its correlated
server and an uncorrelated server, respectively. Note that
the time shown on the graph has been adjusted according
to the time that trafﬁc starts showing via ISI.
The detection accuracy rate in the interception attack
case decreases from the average 95% in static asymmet-
ric trafﬁc analysis to 90%. One main reason is that we
conﬁgure all 50 Tor clients to connect to the same Tor
guard relay, which leads to signiﬁcantly higher probabil-
ity that many of them will share the same Tor exit relay
(especially those clients which are in the same AS) as
well, and as a result, their bandwidths are highly likely
to be similar. And also, all the clients start requesting

ﬁles from the web servers at the same time, so the band-
width they could achieve will be limited by the guard and
the exit relay, which leads to similar bandwidths due to
the guard/exit bottleneck. However, this scenario is an
extreme and very unlikely case in real Tor connections.
With fewer clients connecting to the same Tor guard re-
lay at the same time, the accuracy of the asymmetric traf-
ﬁc analysis should be higher.
The vast majority of Tor relays are vulnerable to our
attacks. Technically, only preﬁxes shorter than /24 can
be hijacked globally with a more-speciﬁc preﬁx attack
as longer preﬁxes tend to be ﬁltered by default by many
ISPs. To make sure of the feasibility of our attack, we
computed the preﬁx length distribution of Tor preﬁxes
(see Fig.14). We can see that more than 90% of BGP pre-
ﬁxes hosting relays have preﬁx length shorter than /24,
making them directly vulnerable to a more-speciﬁc pre-
ﬁx attack such as ours.
6 Countermeasures Sketch
In this section, we ﬁrst describe a taxonomy of counter-
measures against Raptor attacks. Second, we describe
a general approach for AS-aware anonymous communi-
cation in which Tor clients are aware of the dynamics
of Internet routing. Finally, we describe exploratory ap-
proaches for detecting and preventing BGP hijack and
interception attacks against Tor.

6.1 Countermeasure Taxonomy
There are two main categories of countermeasures: (a)
approaches that reduce the chance of an AS-level adver-
sary observing both ends of the anonymous communica-
tion, and (b) approaches that aim to mitigate correlation
attacks even when an adversary observes both ends of
the anonymous communication. Figure 15 illustrates the
design space of potential countermeasures against Rap-
tor attacks. In this work, we advocate the former line of
defense – namely, to monitor both routing control-plane
and data-plane, and to strategically select Tor relays that
minimize the chance of compromise (§6.2). We also ad-
vocate defenses that aim to detect and prevent routing at-
tacks (§6.3). We do not focus on the class of approaches
that aim to mitigate correlation analysis by obfuscating
packet sizes and timings, as they are generally consid-
ered too costly to deploy (Appendix A).

6.2 AS-Aware Path Selection
To minimize opportunities for AS-level trafﬁc analysis,
the Tor network can monitor the path dynamics between
the clients and the guard relays, and between the exit re-
lays and the destinations. Information about path dynam-
ics can be obtained using data-plane (e.g., traceroute)
or control-plane (e.g., BGP feed) tools. For instance,
each relay could publish the list of any ASes it used to
reach each destination preﬁx in the last month. This in-
formation can be distributed to all Tor clients as part of
the Tor network consensus data. Tor clients can use this
data in relay selection, perhaps in combination with their
own traceroute measurements of the forward path to each
guard relay. For example, Tor clients should select relays
such that the same AS does not appear in both the ﬁrst
and the last segments, after taking path dynamics into
account.
6.3 Mitigating Routing Attacks in Tor
Next, we consider two approaches for mitigating Rap-
tor’s routing attacks: detection and prevention.
6.3.1 Monitoring Framework for Detection Routing
Attacks
We propose that the Tor network monitor the routing
control-plane and data-plane for robust detection of rout-
ing attacks. Detecting routing attacks serves two pur-
poses: (1) First, this serves to raise awareness about the
problem and hold attackers accountable. (2) Second, Tor
directory authorities can notify clients. Such notiﬁca-
tions allow the end-user to respond by either suspend-
ing its use of Tor (since most hijacks and interceptions
are short lived), or choose another Tor relay . Next, we
discuss two proof-of-concept monitoring frameworks,
based on BGP data and traceroute data respectively.
BGP Monitoring Framework. Our BGP monitor-
ing framework gathers BGP data from the Routeviews
project. The framework ﬁlters BGP updates to consider
data about preﬁxes that involve a Tor relay. Building
upon prior work in routing attack detection [16], we im-
plement the following heuristics. (1) Frequency heuris-
tic: routing attacks can be characterized by an AS an-
nouncing a path once (or extremely rarely) to a preﬁx that
it does not own. The frequency heuristic detects attacks
that exhibit this behavior. It measures the frequency of
each AS that originates a given preﬁx; if the frequency
is lower than a speciﬁed threshold, then it could be a po-
tential hijack attack. (2) Time Heuristic. Most known
attacks, including those discussed in § 5, last a relatively
short amount of time. The time heuristic measures the
amount of time each path to a preﬁx is announced for;
if the amount of time is extremely small (below a speci-
ﬁed threshold), then there is the possibility of it being a
routing attack.
Detection Capability: We tested our BGP monitoring
framework based on BGP data during known preﬁx hi-
jack attacks, that were discussed in § 5. As a preliminary
validation, the frequency and time heuristics were able
to detect all of the known attacks; the threshold used for
the frequency heuristic was .00001 (the fraction {# of an-
nouncements for preﬁx p originated by AS A}/{total # of
announcements for preﬁx p}), and the threshold used for
the time heuristic was .01 (the fraction {length of time
that preﬁx p is originated by AS A}/{total length of time
preﬁx p is announced by any AS}).
Traceroute Monitoring Framework. The BGP mon-
itoring framework provides measurements of actual AS-
level paths from BGP collector nodes. However, the in-
put data to the monitoring framework is limited to peers
who chose to participate in frameworks such as Route-
views, and BGP data is only a noisy indicator of the rout-

ing control-plane. For robust detection of attacks, it is
also necessary to monitor the data-plane, which we do
via a Traceroute monitoring framework.
Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool that infers the
routers traversed by internet packets. To analyze both
attacks and changes in AS-level paths to the Tor net-
work, we have built a traceroute monitoring framework
that runs traceroutes from 450 PlanetLab machines to all
Tor entry and exit relays and stores the resulting tracer-
oute data. The set of all Tor entry and exit relays is
updated daily to accommodate new relays that have re-
ceived the guard and exit ﬂags. BGP hijack and inter-
ception attacks typically affect a variety of users from
different vantage points. Thus, traceroute measurements
from 450 geographically diverse PlanetLab have the abil-
ity to detect data-plane anomalies arising out of routing
attacks. The PlanetLab machines are distributed across
140 ASes. Meanwhile, the Tor entry relays are dis-
tributed across 982 ASes and the exit relays are dis-
tributed across 882 ASes. We use Team-Cymru (http:
//www.team-cymru.org/) to compute the mapping be-
tween an IP address and its autonomous system. We will
make the data collected by our Traceroute monitoring
framework available to the research community.
Detection Capability: As a preliminary validation, our
Traceroute monitoring framework was able to detect the
the BGP interception attack discussed in § 5. From the
traceroute data, we observed AS-level path changes from
every PlanetLab node to our Tor guard relay, indicating
an anomaly.
6.3.2 Preventing Routing Attacks in Tor
In addition to monitoring the routing control-plane and
data-plane with respect to the Tor network, the following
approaches can help prevent the threat of Raptor’s rout-
ing attacks.
Advertising /24 Tor preﬁxes: Our experimental mea-
surements indicate that over 90% of Tor relays have a
preﬁx length shorter than /24. This allows an AS-level
adversary to launch a BGP hijack or interception attack
against these Tor relays by advertising a more speciﬁc
preﬁx for them (globally). We advocate that the Tor re-
lay operators should be running Tor relays with a preﬁx
length of /24. Autonomous systems typically ﬁlter route
advertisements of preﬁx longer than /24, so AS-level ad-
versaries will not be able to launch a more speciﬁc hijack
or interception attack.
Favoring closer guard relays: Even if a Tor relay adver-
tises a /24 preﬁx, an AS-level adversary can launch an
equally speciﬁc preﬁx hijack or interception attack (by
advertising another /24). In this case, the impact of the
attack is localized around the attacker’s autonomous sys-
tem, since the route is not globally propagated. We advo-
cate that Tor clients select their guard relays by favoring
Tor relays with a shorter AS-level path between them.
Tor clients could either obtain AS-level path information
via the Tor network consensus download mechanism, or
they can perform traceroutes themselves. This further
mitigates the risk to Tor clients due to an equally speciﬁc
preﬁx attack. We note that by selecting guard relays that
are closer to the client in the AS topology, the risk of
asymmetric trafﬁc analysis and BGP churn is also miti-
gated. 2
Securing inter-domain routing: The research commu-
nity has proposed multiple protocols for securing inter-
domain routing [41, 32, 19, 29, 17]. Real-world deploy-
ment of these protocols would mitigate the BGP hijack
and interception attacks on Tor. However, this approach
requires buy-in from multiple stakeholders in the com-
plex ecosystem of the Internet, and progress on this front
has been slow. We hope that the concerns we raise about
the compromise of user anonymity in Tor can help accel-
erate the momentum for improving BGP security.
7 Discussion and Ethical Considerations
Colluding adversaries. In this paper, we quantiﬁed the
threat of Raptor attacks from the perspective of indi-
vidual autonomous systems.
In practice, autonomous
systems can collude with each other to increase their
capability of monitoring Tor trafﬁc. For example, au-
tonomous systems within the same legal jurisdiction may
be forced to monitor Tor trafﬁc and share it with a single
entity that may launch Raptor attacks.
Applicability to other anonymity systems. It is impor-
tant to note that our attacks merely consider Tor as an
example of a low-latency anonymity system. Raptor at-
tacks are broadly applicable to other deployed anonymity
systems such as I2P, Freenet and Tribler [47, 21, 50].
Ethical considerations. We introduce and evaluate sev-
eral novel attacks against the Tor network. The Tor net-
work has a userbase of several million users [9], and
these users are especially concerned about the privacy of
their communications. Thus, it is of utmost importance
that our real-world experiments on the Tor network do
not compromise the privacy and safety of Tor users. In
this paper, we take multiple precautions to safeguard the
privacy of Tor users:
• Attack our own trafﬁc. All of our attacks only exper-
iment with trafﬁc that we created ourselves, i.e., we
deanonymize our own trafﬁc. In fact, we do not store
or analyze trafﬁc of any real Tor user.
2We note that if clients select closer guards, then knowledge of the
guards reveals probabilistic information about the clients. We will in-
vestigate this trade-off in future work.

• Attack our own relay. Similarly, to demonstrate the
threat of preﬁx interception attacks on the live Tor net-
work, we launch interception attacks against relays
that we already control, i.e., we hijack/intercept our
own preﬁx.
• Firewall our Tor relay. We also used network-level
ﬁrewalls to ensure that real Tor users will never use re-
lays that we control: trafﬁc from real users is dropped
by the ﬁrewall. Only authorized trafﬁc that we create
ourselves can bypass the ﬁrewall and use our Tor relay.
8 Related Work
AS-level adversaries: It is well known that an adversary
who can observe users’ communications at both ends
of the segment can deanonymize Tor clients [45, 54].
Feamster and Dingledine were the ﬁrst to consider the at-
tack from the perspective of an AS-level adversary [28].
Later, Edman and Syverson explored the impact of
Tor path selection strategies on the security of the net-
work [26]. Recently, Johnson et al. analyzed the secu-
rity of the Tor network against AS-level adversaries in
terms of user understandable metrics for anonymity [34],
and Akhoondi et al. [13] considered path selection algo-
rithms that minimize opportunities for AS-level end-to-
end trafﬁc analysis. Finally, Murdoch et al. [40] consid-
ered the analogous analysis with respect to Internet ex-
change level adversaries, which are also in a position to
observe a signiﬁcant fraction of Internet trafﬁc.
We build upon these works and introduce Raptor at-
tacks, that leverage routing asymmetry, routing churn,
and routing attacks to compromise user anonymity more
effectively than previously thought possible.
The attack observations in Raptor were brieﬂy dis-
cussed in a preliminary and short workshop paper [48].
In this paper, we go further by measuring the importance
of the attacks using real-world Internet control- and data-
plane data. We also demonstrate the attacks feasibility by
performing them on the live Tor network—with success.
Finally, we also describe efﬁcient countermeasures to re-
store a good level of anonymity.
Trafﬁc analysis of Tor: An important thread of re-
search aims to perform trafﬁc analysis of Tor commu-
nications via side-channel information about Tor relays.
Murdoch et al. [39], Evans et al. [27], and Jansen et
al. [33] have demonstrated attacks that use node con-
gestion and protocol-level details as a side channel to
uncover Tor relays involved in anonymous paths. Fur-
thermore, Mittal et al. [37] and Hopper et al. [30, 31]
proposed the use of network throughput and network la-
tency as a side channel to ﬁngerprint Tor relays involved
in anonymous paths. We note that most of these attacks
provide probabilistic information about Tor relays, and
may not deanonymize the Tor clients. In contrast, Raptor
attacks can completely deanonymize Tor clients.
BGP insecurity: The networking research community
has extensively studied attacks on inter-domain routing
protocols including BGP hijack [51, 52, 53, 44] and in-
terception attacks [16]. Similarly, there has been much
work on proposing secure routing protocols that resist the
above attacks [41, 32, 17, 19, 29]. However, we are the
ﬁrst to study the implications of these attacks on privacy
technologies such as the Tor network. Arnbak et al. [14]
discuss surveillance capabilities of autonomous systems
from a legal perspective, but do not discuss anonymity
systems.
9 Conclusion
Raptor attacks exploit the dynamics of Internet routing
(such as routing asymmetry, routing churn, and routing
