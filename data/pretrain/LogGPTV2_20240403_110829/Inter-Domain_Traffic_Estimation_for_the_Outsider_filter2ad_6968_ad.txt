### Regression Line and Standard Deviation

The figure illustrates how the standard deviation logically varies based on the fraction of clusters used. Specifically, as the number of points used to compute the fit increases, the number of clusters left for value estimation decreases, making estimation errors more noticeable in smaller clusters. For some clusters of links, traffic prediction estimates can be significantly off (e.g., predicting 5MB when the actual traffic is close to 1MB, resulting in a 500% error). However, the figure shows that the mean value remains relatively stable around 0.5, indicating that, on average, the median estimated traffic (in megabytes) differs from the cluster's real value by approximately 50%.

While we acknowledge that order of magnitude is a coarse approximation, this method represents a valuable first step in inferring traffic volumes that are not directly measurable at scale or without access to proprietary data (e.g., Arbor Network’s collection of inter-domain traffic data from about 110 commercial networks [33]). For instance, the accuracy of alternative methods that formulate inter-domain traffic estimation as a matrix completion problem [24] is largely unknown.

### Ranking AS-Links Based on Traffic Volume

To demonstrate the second use case, we rank AS-links based on different Network Syntax metrics as a proxy for the traffic-volume-based ranking of those links. We start by ranking the AS-links based on the amount of traffic they carry using our ground-truth traffic data. We then select the subset of links identified in our dataset and cluster them into equal-sized groups (ten in this case). For each group, we compute its ranking for both the relative Network Syntax metric and carried traffic, as the average of the individual rankings of the AS-links within the group.

Given the strong correlation between the different Network Syntax metrics and traffic volume, any of the metrics could be used to rank the links. For this analysis, we select the two metrics with the highest degree of correlation: connectivity and ALTP-frequency, and compare their results.

### Figures 15 and 16

- **Figure 15**: Correlation between traffic-based ranking and connectivity for IXP and ISP.
- **Figure 16**: Correlation between traffic-based ranking and ALTP-frequency for IXP and ISP.

Both figures show strong \( r^2 \) values for all four datasets using both Network Syntax metrics. However, ALTP-frequency \( r^2 \) values are slightly higher than their connectivity counterparts, with values as high as 0.95 for ISP and 0.75 for IXP. These results indicate that using Network Syntax metrics to rank AS-links can effectively approximate the ranking based on the amount of traffic they carry.

### Discussion

#### BGP-Derived Connectivity Graphs

As discussed in Section 3.2, Network Syntax cannot be applied to just any AS-level connectivity graph but depends on the information embedded in the graph inferred from traceroute datasets. To illustrate this, we apply Network Syntax to the connectivity graph for ISP derived from the subset of AS-level paths contained in the public BGP view [5] for April 2011. We extract all BGP announcements containing the AS number for ISP, derive their corresponding AS-level paths, and generate the connectivity graph. We then compute the different Network Syntax metrics and evaluate our findings in the context of the ground-truth traffic data for ISP for the same time period.

#### Figure 17

- **Connectivity**
- **Control Value**
- **Global Choice**
- **Integration**

The figure shows that, as anticipated, none of the metrics are strongly correlated with traffic volume. In most cases, links are clustered together either on the lower left side of the plot (corresponding to low traffic volume and nearly identical Network Syntax metric) or mostly grouped on the right lower side of the plot (which corresponds to high Network Syntax metric and low traffic volume).

#### Errors in Traceroute-to-AS Mappings

The pitfalls of IP-to-AS level mapping for AS topology inference are well-known. The common approach of using longest prefix matching to map the routers' IP addresses of a traceroute to AS numbers can generate potentially false AS links [49]. Several previous research efforts have studied these pitfalls [15, 17, 29, 36, 37] and identified common causes for the mismatch, ranging from the incompleteness of IP-to-AS mappings gathered from publicly available BGP feeds to the constraints inherent to the traceroute measurement itself (e.g., routers silently dropping probes or not altering packets' TTL). We correct our datasets to avoid these pitfalls, as described in Section 4.2.

#### Robustness of Network Syntax

We explore the robustness of Network Syntax when applied to traceroute datasets with known issues. We do this by computing the different Network Syntax metrics on the un-corrected April 2011 traceroute dataset for ISP and comparing the resulting correlation with the corrected version.

#### Table 5: Comparison of \( r^2 \) Values

| Metric          | Uncorrected \( r^2 \) | Corrected \( r^2 \) |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Connectivity    | 0.759                | 0.789               |
| Control Value   | 0.708                | 0.759               |
| Global Choice   | 0.314                | 0.653               |
| Integration     | 0.749                | 0.826               |
| ALTP-Frequency  | 0.919                | 0.965               |

The results show that the application of different correction heuristics improves the correlation between traffic volume and the different metrics. However, most metrics (with the exception of global choice) still show significant \( r^2 \) values when computed using the un-corrected dataset.

#### Other Datasets

We apply the same technique to a different dataset collected from CAIDA’s Ark monitors for the same time periods. This traceroute dataset consists of probes launched towards randomly selected IP addresses from CAIDA’s Ark monitors [12], which probe IP addresses from every routable IPv4 /24 prefix in cycles of approximately 48 hours. For this analysis, we combined data from three different probing cycles completed by different sets of Ark monitors between April 1-7, 2011, and April 1-7, 2013.

#### Figures 18 and 19

- **Figure 18**: Correlation between traffic volume and different Network Syntax metrics for the CAIDA 2011 dataset for ISP.
- **Figure 19**: Correlation of AS-link ranking based on traffic volume versus ranking based on ALTP-frequency, using the CAIDA dataset for both IXP and ISP.

The observed trends are similar to those seen in Section 5.2, where the amount of traffic carried by the clustered links strongly correlates with the different Network Syntax metrics. However, the \( r^2 \) values are smaller than their Ono-dataset counterparts. This difference is likely due to the fundamental differences in how the underlying traceroutes were collected, as shown in Table 6.
