**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): 1.4.5
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : local install
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CentOS 7

**What happened** :  
Download 1.4.5 release tarball from Github:  
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/download/v1.4.5/kubernetes.tar.gz  
Unpack it and look at documentation folder docs/yaml/kubectl/...  
Inside that folder user can see bunch of yaml files that have content:
    This file is autogenerated, but we've stopped checking such files into the
    repository to reduce the need for rebases. Please run hack/generate-docs.sh to
    populate this file.
**What you expected to happen** :  
In my opinion, those placeholders should be replaced with real generated
documentation at the time of release. So, somewhere in release scripts call to
generate documentation is missing.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
    $ wget https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/download/v1.4.5/kubernetes.tar.gz
    $ tar zxf kubernetes.tar.gz
    $ cat kubernetes/docs/yaml/kubectl/kubectl_api-versions.yaml
