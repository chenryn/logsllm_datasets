Abstract
Password-based authentication is easy to use but its
security is bounded by how much a user can remember.
Biometrics-based authentication requires no memorization
but ‘resetting’ a biometric password may not always be pos-
sible.
In this paper, we propose a user-friendly authenti-
cation system (KinWrite) that allows users to choose ar-
bitrary, short and easy-to-memorize passwords while pro-
viding resilience to password cracking and password theft.
KinWrite lets users write their passwords in 3D space and
captures the handwriting motion using a low cost motion
input sensing device—Kinect. The low resolution and noisy
data captured by Kinect, combined with low consistency
of in-space handwriting, have made it challenging to ver-
ify users. To overcome these challenges, we exploit the
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to quantify sim-
ilarities between handwritten passwords. Our experimen-
tal results involving 35 signatures from 18 subjects and a
brute-force attacker have shown that KinWrite can achieve
a 100% precision and a 70% recall (the worst case) for
verifying honest users, encouraging us to carry out a much
larger scale study towards designing a foolproof system.
1 Introduction
Authentication plays a key role in securing various re-
sources including corporate facilities or electronic assets.
Naturally, numerous authentication mechanisms have been
proposed in the past, and in general they can be divided
into three categories:
(a) knowledge-based, (b) token-
based, (c) biometrics-based. Knowledge-based authentica-
tion (e.g., text passwords) has been widely utilized because
of its ease of use and ease of update. Unfortunately, text-
password-based authentication veriﬁes the ownership of a
text password instead of a user and thus can suffer from

password theft [1]—anyone with the text password will pass
the authentication. It is also restricted by how much a hu-
man can remember—what is hard to guess is often hard
to remember [2]. Token-based authentication frees humans
from tedious memorizing. It authenticates users by exam-
ining their pre-assigned tokens, e.g., physical keys, RFID
tags, RSA SecureID tokens, smart cards, smartphones [3],
etc. However, such mechanisms are also vulnerable to to-
ken theft. Lost or stolen tokens can easily allow anyone pass
authentication. Finally, biometrics-based mechanisms that
utilize physiological biometrics, e.g., ﬁngerprints, voice, fa-
cial and iris patterns, are less likely to suffer from iden-
tity theft. However, their applications have received resis-
tance from privacy-savvy users, who worry that they will be
tracked, based on their unique physiological biometrics [4].
In this paper, we propose a user-friendly authentication
system called KinWrite that allows users to choose short and
easy-to-memorize passwords while providing resilience to
password cracking and password theft. The basic idea is
to let a user write her password in space instead of typing
it. Writing in space adds behavioral biometrics to a pass-
word (e.g., personal handwriting characteristics) and cre-
ates a large number of personalized passwords that are dif-
ﬁcult to duplicate. As a result, KinWrite inherits the ad-
vantages of both password-based and biometrics-based ac-
cess control: KinWrite authenticates “who you are” instead
of “what you own” or “ what you know,” and allows users
to update their passwords on demand. Hence, stolen pass-
words, shoulder surﬁng [5], and user tracking become less
of a threat.
To capture
in-space handwriting (hereafter 3D-
signature), KinWrite utilizes Kinect
[6], which is a
low-cost motion input sensor device capable of recording
3D depth information of a human body. Using the depth
information, we can detect and track ﬁngertip motion to
obtain a corresponding 3D-signature. Kinect is well-suited
for this task and can be used in various authentication
scenarios including door access control, because it can op-
erate under almost any ambient light conditions, including
complete darkness [7]. Verifying a user’s identity utiliz-
ing 3D-signatures captured by Kinect seems simple yet
appealing. However, several issues make it a challenging
task. First, Kinect is known for its abundant errors and low
resolution [8], which may result in distorted 3D-signature
samples, as shown in Figure 1. Second, the same users
may produce different 3D-signatures over time. Third, the
requirement of user-friendly design limits the number of
3D-signatures needed for the initial ‘password’ enrollment,
and thus disqualiﬁes many classiﬁcation algorithms. Last
but not the least, an adversary may try to impersonate a
legitimate user. The proposed system has to be able to
reject such attempts virtually all the time.
We illustrate the aforementioned challenges in Figure 1:
All three signatures are captured using Kinect when a pass-
word of ‘ma’ was written in the space. In particular, Fig-
ure 1 (a-b) were written by the same user and Figure 1(c)
was generated by an adversary who observed the victim
four times and was given the spelling of the password.
Although the adversary was able to generate a signature
closely imitating the genuine one (shown in Figure 1 (a))
and the two genuine signatures appeared to be different, our
KinWrite system is able to correctly identify both genuine
signatures and reject the forged one.
KinWrite can verify legitimate users and reject attacks
well because it is based on the following intuition. Granted
that the shapes of signatures are important, they may change
over time and may be learned after being observed visu-
ally. In contrast, we believe several spontaneous gestures
that are embedded in the movement of in-space handwrit-
ing, can characterize each user better and are difﬁcult to im-
itate, which we will show through our experiments. A user
may write letters in different sizes or shapes, but the accel-
eration at turning points and the transition of consecutive
points may not vary much. Thus, to verify a signature, Kin-
Write examines not only the shape but also several gesture-
related features. Lacking a large number of training signa-
tures, KinWrite utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to
verify signatures, because DTW only requires the storage
of one known genuine signature as a template and can ac-
commodate differences in timing between 3D-signatures.
The main contributions of this paper are listed below.
• We propose a behavior-based authentication sys-
tem (called KinWrite) that combines the beneﬁts of
both traditional password-based and biometrics-based
schemes. The underlying idea is letting a user write
passwords (including short ones) in 3D-space instead
of typing them. KinWrite utilizes 3D-signatures as
user ‘passwords’, and it veriﬁes users with the Dy-
namic Time Warping algorithm.
• We have built a signature capturing system utilizing
Microsoft Kinect. With this system, we collected 1180
3D-signatures from 18 users over ﬁve months, and
with each, we selected up to two different passwords.
(a) genuine
(b) genuine
(c) forged
Figure 1. The same user may sign the pass-
word in 3D space differently while an adver-
sary with knowledge may be able to imitate
the shape of the genuine signature closely.
Our KinWrite system correctly veriﬁed the
genuine handwriting (a-b) and rejected the
forged one (c).
In addition, we modelled 5 types of attackers with an
increasing amount of information about the passwords
and collected 1200 3D-signatures from 18 attackers.
• We evaluated KinWrite using captured 3D-signatures.
The results show that KinWrite can effectively verify
honest users and is robust to various types of attackers,
including the one that observes victims multiple times
and is aware of the spelling of the passwords.
Compared with traditional online signatures that uses
tablets, KinWrite has the advantage of being contactless,
and signing in the 3D-space leaves no traces.
We organize the remainder of the paper as follows. We
discuss related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we present
the system design requirements and the attack models, in-
troduce Kinect, and overview the KinWrite architecture.
Then, we discuss data processing and feature extraction
in Section 4, and introduce the Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW)-based veriﬁcation algorithm in Section 5. Finally,
we show that KinWrite is effective in verifying users and
rejecting various attackers in Section 6 and give our conclu-
sions in Section 7.

2.1 Authentication
The most widely used, text-based password authentication
schemes are known to be susceptible to shoulder surﬁng,
and their security is limited by what people can remem-
ber. Graphical passwords are claimed to be a better solution
because humans can remember pictures more easily than
a string of characters. Recognition-based graphical pass-
words [2,9] require users to choose their preselected images
from several random pictures for authentication, and some
schemes [10,11] have been designed to cope with the prob-
lem of shoulder surﬁng. Another class of graphical pass-
words asks users to click through several preselected loca-
tions on one image [12]. All those schemes authenticate
‘what you know.’ In comparison, biometrics-based schemes
verify ‘who you are.’ Traditional biometrics-based schemes
utilize physiological biometrics [13], including iris patterns,
retina patterns, ﬁngerprints, etc. New approaches utilize be-
havioral biometrics, such as keystroke dynamics [14, 15] or
mouse movements [16, 17], for authentication. KinWrite
belongs to the same family of behavioral biometrics. How-
ever, most prior behavior-based methods were designed for
continuously verifying a user throughout the session as the
user operates the keyboard or mouse. KinWrite solves a
different problem and targets at authenticating a user once.
Hand-drawn pictures have been proposed as one type
of graphical passwords.
For instance, Draw-a-Secret
(DAS) [18] requires a user to draw a simple picture on a 2D
grid, and the user is authenticated if he/she visits the same
sequence of grids. KinWrite can also use graphical draw-
ing instead of handwritten signatures as passwords. Nev-
ertheless, in this paper, we focus on studying handwritten
signatures. Compared with DAS, whose password space is
limited by the number of vertices, KinWrite captures the
exact trajectory of a 3D-signaure and thus enables a much
larger password space.
2.2 Online Signature Veriﬁcation
With the development of digital equipment, online signa-
tures have gradually replaced ofﬂine signatures (images
of signatures) for user identiﬁcation. For instance, pres-
sure sensitive tablets can record a sequence of 2D signa-
ture coordinates as well as pressure. Methods to verify
such signatures ﬁrst extract features from either each sam-
ple point or the entire signature [19], and then compare the
features against the registered genuine one. The common
classiﬁcation approaches used for comparison include the
following:
the Bayes classiﬁer [20], Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) [21, 22], Neural Networks (NN) [23], Hidden
Markov Models (HMM) [24, 25], Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) [26, 27]. Several other systems have also been pro-
posed for classiﬁcation: a pan-trajectory-based veriﬁcation
system [28], verifying based on symbolic features [29], us-
ing camera-based signature acquisition [30], or an elastic
local-shape-based model [31], etc.
Both KinWrite and online signature utilize behavioral
biometrics: handwritten signature. Naturally,
the two
systems share similarity. However, we believe that 3D-
signatures contain richer behavioral information than 2D
online signatures captured by tablets. For instance, ges-
ture features are embedded in 3D-signatures, but are dif-
ﬁcult to include in 2D online signatures. We envision that
3D-signatures, if done well, can be a good biometric for
user authentication.
2.3 Gesture-Based Veriﬁcation
A few systems have proposed to use hand gestures for user
veriﬁcation. Those systems require users to hold a special
device in their hands, such as a phone [32] that captures
arm sweep action; a tri-axis accelerometer [33] that cap-
tures simple gestures; a biometric smart pen [34] that col-
lects grip strength, the tilt of the pen, the acceleration, etc.
KinWrite has the advantage of writing with an empty hand,
and such a no-contact method has its advantage to germ
conscious users.
2.4 Kinect Application
Kinect, because of its low cost and capability to provide
depth and human gesture information, has gained popu-
larity among researchers.
It has been used to extract the
contour of human body for human identiﬁcation [35], de-
tect human behavior [36] (e.g, walking, running, etc) uti-
lizing skeleton information, recognize sign language [37],
and track a head for augmented reality [38] or ﬁngertips
and palms [39]. Kinect is also used in real-time robotics
control and building 3D maps of indoor environments [40].
Our system also utilizes the depth information provided by
Kinect to track ﬁngertips, but the focus of our work is to
verify 3D-signatures.
3 KinWrite Overview
The KinWrite system consists of a Kinect for capturing 3D-
signatures, a secure storage for storing abstracts of enrolled
3D-signature templates, and a computing unit for process-
ing data and verifying users. KinWrite, as an authentica-
tion system, can be used for various authentication scenar-
ios. Considering that the range of a Kinect sensor is about
0.8m to 4m, KinWrite can work well for ofﬁce building
access control. For instance, a Kinect can be installed at
the entrance of a building. To enter the building, a user
approaches the Kinect and signs her password towards it.
Then, KinWrite will process the captured raw 3D-signature,
and authenticate the user by comparing it with the already
enrolled genuine 3D-signature.
In this section, we discuss the design requirement of Kin-
Write, the attack model, the intuition of using a Kinect, and
the system architecture.
3.1 System Requirements
Around-the-Clock Use. Similar to most authentication
systems, KinWrite is expected to work around the clock,
regardless of the weather or lighting conditions.
