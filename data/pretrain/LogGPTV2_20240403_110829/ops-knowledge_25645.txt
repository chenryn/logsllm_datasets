### Log Summary

This log chunk, spanning from 18:06:32 to 18:06:37 on October 18, documents multiple issues and retries in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **Address Change Detection**:
   - Multiple instances of address changes are detected for both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` components.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` (for `LeaseRenewer`) and `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` (for `RMCommunicator Allocator`), and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000` and `msra-sa-41:8030`, respectively.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times.
   - Each failure is logged with an increasing duration (from 94 to 98 seconds) and indicates that a retry will be attempted shortly.

3. **Connection Retries**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The connection attempts are logged with a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` (maximum retries = 10, sleep time = 1000 milliseconds).
   - Each attempt logs that it has already tried 0 times, indicating that the retry mechanism is not incrementing the retry count correctly.

4. **Error in Contacting RM**:
   - Multiple `ERROR` logs indicate that there is an issue in contacting the Resource Manager (RM).

### Detailed Breakdown

- **10-18 18:06:32 to 10-18 18:06:37**:
  - **LeaseRenewer**:
    - Address change detection from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
    - Lease renewal failures for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` with durations ranging from 94 to 98 seconds.
  - **RMCommunicator Allocator**:
    - Address change detection from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
    - Connection retries to `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep`.
    - Errors in contacting the Resource Manager.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with address changes and failed lease renewals, as well as repeated unsuccessful attempts to connect to the Resource Manager. These issues suggest potential network or configuration problems that need to be addressed to ensure stable operation of the Hadoop cluster.
