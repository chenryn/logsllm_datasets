User: I have a question about using os.execvp in Python. I have the following bit of code that's used to create a list of arguments:

args = [ "java"
       , classpath
       , "-Djava.library.path=" + lib_path()
       , ea
       , "-Xmx1000m"
       , "-server"
       , "code_swarm"
       , params
       ]

When I output a string using " ".join(args) and paste that into my shell prompt, the JVM launches fine, and everything works. Everything works if I use os.system(" ".join(args)) in my Python script, too.
But the following bit of code does not work:
os.execvp("java", args)
I get the following error:

Unrecognized option: -classpath [and then the classpath I created, which looks okay]
Could not create the Java virtual machine.

So what gives? Why does copying/pasting into the shell or using os.system() work, but not os.execvp()?
Assistant: Make sure you aren't relying on shell expansion in your classpath.  E.g. "~/my.jar" will get expanded by the shell in an os.system call, but not, I believe in an os.execvp call.
