Measurement Project dataset. We calculate the total interconnect capacity for
each ISP by summing the capacities for all of the links associated with the ISP.
To enable comparison between ISPs that may have more or less infrastructure
overall, we normalize the capacity values for each using min-max normalization.
We again ﬁlter out date values that are beyond two standard deviations from
a rolling 60-day window mean. To show aggregate infrastructure changes over
time, we take all of the data points in each ﬁscal quarter and perform a least-
squares linear regression using SciKit Learn. This regression yields a slope for
each quarter that illustrates the best-ﬁt rate of capacity increases over that quar-
ter. We scale the slope value to show what the increase would be if the pace was
maintained for 365 days (i.e., a slope of 1 would result in a doubling of capacity
over the course of a year). Figure 6 shows the resulting capacity plots.
The overall trend shows how these two ISPs in the United States aggressively
added capacity at interconnects—at more than twice the rate at which they were
adding capacity over a comparable time period in the previous year. Second, both
ISPs signiﬁcantly added capacity in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020—at a far greater
rate than they were adding capacity in the ﬁrst quarter of 2019. Recall from
the usage patterns shown in Fig. 1, ISP A tends to operate their links at nearly
full capacity, in contrast to ISP B, where aggregate utilization is well below
90%. Both ISPs witnessed a jump in usage around the lockdown; the response of
aggressively adding capacity appears to have mitigated possible adverse eﬀects
of high utilization rates. The increase in capacity was necessary to cope with the
increased volume: although network performance and utilization ratios returned
to pre-COVID-19 levels, the absolute traﬃc volumes remain high.

Increased Advertised IP Address Space
To cope with abrupt changes caused by COVID-19, application service providers
also took action to expand their infrastructure. Previous work has observed
shifted traﬃc in communication applications (such as video conferencing apps,
email, and messaging) after lockdown [12]. It has been reported informally that
many application providers expanded serving infrastructure, changed the routes
of certain application traﬃc ﬂows, and even altered the bitrates of services to
cope with increased utilization.
While not all of these purported responses are directly observable in pub-
lic datasets; however, RouteViews makes available global routing information,
which can provide some hints about routes and infrastructure, and how various
characteristics of the Internet routing infrastructure change over time. This data
can provide some indication of expanding infrastructure, such as the amount of
IPv4 address space that a particular Autonomous System (AS) is advertising. In
the case of video conference providers, where some of the services may be hosted
on cloud service providers or where the video service is a part of a larger AS
that oﬀers other services (e.g., Google Meet), such a metric is clearly imperfect,
but it can oﬀer some indication of response.
To understand how service providers announced additional IPv4 address
space, we parsed BGP routing tables from RouteViews [22]. For each route
that originates from ASes of certain application providers, we aggregate IP
preﬁxes and translate the resulting preﬁxes into a single count of overall IPv4
address space. We focus on two popular video conferencing applications, Zoom
and WebEx, since they are two of the largest web conference providers in the
United States—as also recognized by the FCC in their recent order for regula-
tory relief [9]. We track the evolution of the advertised IP address space from
the beginning of 2019 through October 2020.

Figure 7 demonstrates how each provider increased the advertised IPv4
address space from before the pandemic through October 2020. After the begin-
ning of the COVID-19 pandemic, both Zoom and WebEx rapidly begin to
advertise additional IPv4 address space. Table 1 enumerates the absolute val-
ues of advertised IP address space: Zoom and WebEx increased the advertised
IP address space by about 4x and 2.5x respectively, as we observe a roughly
corresponding 2–3x increase in video conferencing traﬃc.
7 Conclusion
This paper has explored how traﬃc demands changed as a result of the abrupt
daily patterns caused by the COVID-19 lockdown, how these changing traﬃc
patterns aﬀected the performance of ISPs in the United States, both in aggregate
and for speciﬁc ISPs, and how service providers responded to these shifts in
demand. We observed a 30–60% increase in peak traﬃc rates for two major
ISPs in the US corresponding with signiﬁcant increases in latency in early weeks
of lockdown, followed by a return to pre-lockdown levels, corresponding with
aggressive capacity augmentation at ISP interconnects and the addition of IPv4
address space from video conferencing providers. Although this paper presented
the ﬁrst known study of interconnect utilization and service provider responses to
changes in patterns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, this study still oﬀers
a somewhat limited viewpoint into these eﬀects and characteristics. Future work
could potentially conﬁrm or extend these ﬁndings by exploring these trends for
other ISPs, over the continued lockdown period, and for other service providers.

Appendix A Longitudinal Latency Evolution
for 2018–2019 (Previous Year)
This section provides a basis for performance comparison in Sect. 5. Following
the same analysis, we choose the exact same time period in the previous year (i.e.,
late 2018 to mid-2019) in the United States. We compute the average latency per-
Whitebox per-day, and subsequently explore distributions across Whiteboxes for
each ISP.

Longitudinal Evolution of Aggregate, Average Round-Trip Latency.
Figure 8 shows the aggregate average latency per-Whitebox per-day. The previ-
ous year has an overall latency of about 6ms lower than 2020. We observe that
the latency keeps stable until the end of April, where a deviation of about 2 ms
is shown. The rate of increase is of about 10%, echoing similar eﬀects around
lockdown.
Longitudinal Evolution of per-ISP Latencies. We further break the aggre-
gate results into the granularity of ISPs. We report both 95th and 99th percentile
latencies here. Note that in the 95th percentile plot, we show the groups diﬀer-
ently, mainly because of major diﬀerences of latency for Mediacom and AT&T
compared to other ISPs. From Fig. 9, we ﬁnd that the majority of ISPs per-
formed stably, while Mediacom has a large variance in the average RTT. They
both have a tail that contributes to what we observed in Fig. 8. Figure 10 is
grouped the same as Fig. 5, which shows that for certain ISPs, they experience
similar deviations in latency during similar periods of diﬀerent years.
Appendix B Throughput-Latency Relationship
We put a supplementary ﬁgure referred to in Sect. 5 in this appendix. It shows
the distributional changes in latency and throughput on a 4-h basis. Detailed
explanations are in the main text.
