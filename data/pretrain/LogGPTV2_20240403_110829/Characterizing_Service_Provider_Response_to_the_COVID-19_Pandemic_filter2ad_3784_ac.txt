### Measurement Project Dataset

We calculate the total interconnect capacity for each Internet Service Provider (ISP) by summing the capacities of all associated links. To facilitate comparison between ISPs with varying levels of infrastructure, we normalize the capacity values using min-max normalization. We filter out data points that are more than two standard deviations from the rolling 60-day window mean. To illustrate aggregate infrastructure changes over time, we use all data points within each fiscal quarter and perform a least-squares linear regression using SciKit Learn. This regression yields a slope for each quarter, indicating the best-fit rate of capacity increases. We scale the slope to show the annual increase if the pace were maintained for 365 days (a slope of 1 would result in a doubling of capacity over the course of a year). Figure 6 presents the resulting capacity plots.

### Capacity Trends

The overall trend shows that two major ISPs in the United States significantly increased their interconnect capacity at more than twice the rate observed in the previous year. Specifically, both ISPs added substantial capacity in the first quarter of 2020, far exceeding the capacity additions in the first quarter of 2019. As shown in Figure 1, ISP A operates its links near full capacity, while ISP B's aggregate utilization is well below 90%. Both ISPs experienced a surge in usage during the lockdown, and their aggressive capacity additions appear to have mitigated potential adverse effects of high utilization rates. The increase in capacity was necessary to handle the higher traffic volumes, even though network performance and utilization ratios eventually returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, with absolute traffic volumes remaining high.

### Increased Advertised IP Address Space

To cope with the abrupt changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, application service providers also expanded their infrastructure. Previous studies have noted shifts in traffic patterns for communication applications such as video conferencing, email, and messaging after the lockdown [12]. Informal reports suggest that many application providers expanded their serving infrastructure, altered traffic routes, and adjusted service bitrates to manage increased utilization.

While not all these responses are directly observable in public datasets, RouteViews provides global routing information that can offer insights into infrastructure changes. One such metric is the amount of IPv4 address space advertised by a particular Autonomous System (AS). For video conference providers, this metric is imperfect but can still provide some indication of response. 

To understand how service providers announced additional IPv4 address space, we parsed BGP routing tables from RouteViews [22]. For each route originating from ASes of specific application providers, we aggregated IP prefixes and translated them into a single count of overall IPv4 address space. We focused on Zoom and WebEx, two of the largest web conference providers in the United States, as recognized by the FCC [9]. We tracked the evolution of the advertised IP address space from the beginning of 2019 through October 2020.

### Results

Figure 7 illustrates the increase in advertised IPv4 address space by each provider from before the pandemic through October 2020. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, both Zoom and WebEx rapidly began advertising additional IPv4 address space. Table 1 shows the absolute values: Zoom and WebEx increased their advertised IP address space by about 4x and 2.5x, respectively, corresponding to a 2–3x increase in video conferencing traffic.

### Conclusion

This paper examines how traffic demands changed due to the abrupt daily patterns caused by the COVID-19 lockdown, how these changes affected the performance of ISPs in the United States, and how service providers responded. We observed a 30–60% increase in peak traffic rates for two major US ISPs, accompanied by significant increases in latency in the early weeks of the lockdown. These issues were followed by a return to pre-lockdown levels, coinciding with aggressive capacity augmentation at ISP interconnects and the addition of IPv4 address space by video conferencing providers. Although this study offers a limited viewpoint, it provides the first known analysis of interconnect utilization and service provider responses to the pandemic. Future work could extend these findings by exploring trends for other ISPs, over the continued lockdown period, and for other service providers.

### Appendix A: Longitudinal Latency Evolution for 2018–2019 (Previous Year)

This section provides a basis for performance comparison in Section 5. We analyze the same time period in the previous year (late 2018 to mid-2019) in the United States, computing the average latency per Whitebox per day and exploring distributions across Whiteboxes for each ISP.

**Figure 8:** Daily changes in latency from December 2018 to June 2019. (Note: y-axis does not start at zero.)

**Longitudinal Evolution of Aggregate, Average Round-Trip Latency:**

Figure 8 shows the aggregate average latency per Whitebox per day. The previous year had an overall latency of about 6 ms lower than 2020. Latency remained stable until the end of April, where a deviation of about 2 ms was observed, representing a 10% increase, similar to the effects around the lockdown.

**Longitudinal Evolution of per-ISP Latencies:**

We further break down the aggregate results to the granularity of ISPs, reporting both 95th and 99th percentile latencies. In the 95th percentile plot, Mediacom and AT&T show major differences in latency compared to other ISPs. From Figure 9, we find that most ISPs performed stably, while Mediacom showed significant variance in the average RTT, contributing to the observations in Figure 8. Figure 10, grouped similarly to Figure 5, shows that certain ISPs experienced similar deviations in latency during comparable periods in different years.
