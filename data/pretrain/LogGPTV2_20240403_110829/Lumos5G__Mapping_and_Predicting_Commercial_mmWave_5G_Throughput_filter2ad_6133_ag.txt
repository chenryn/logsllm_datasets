and quantitatively, via a carefully designed ML framework ‚Äì
Lumos5G. Our experiences indicate the importance of selecting
composable 5G-specific features discovered from our extensive
measurements, as well as the benefits of using expressive deep
learning architectures that can mine the complex interplay among
the features. Our study hints the potential of developing a city-level
or even country-level fine-grained ‚Äúperformance map‚Äù of 5G
services, which can benefit numerous applications over 5G.
