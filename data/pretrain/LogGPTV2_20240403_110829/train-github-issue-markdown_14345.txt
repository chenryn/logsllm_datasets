Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-target-the-children-
of-an-element-using-jquery has an issue. The first sentence of the text is
incorrect. `Many HTML elements have children elements from which they inherit
properties` should read `Many HTML elements have children elements which
inherit their properties`. Children inherit from parents, not the other way
around.
