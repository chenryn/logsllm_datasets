### Issue with Disabling Reverse Lookup in Rsync Daemon

I am experiencing an issue with some rsync modules being served through `rsync --daemon`.

#### Log Entries
The following lines are from my `/var/log/rsyncd.log` file:

```
2013/02/08 12:15:28 [13174] name lookup failed for XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX: Name or service not known
2013/02/08 12:15:28 [13174] connect from UNKNOWN (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX)
```

#### Rsync Configuration
According to the `rsyncd.conf` man page, the `reverse lookup` option controls whether the daemon performs a reverse DNS lookup on the client's IP address to determine its hostname. This is used for "hosts allow"/"hosts deny" checks and the `%h` log escape. By default, this feature is enabled, but it can be disabled if the lookup is not expected to return a useful result. In such cases, the daemon will use the name "UNDETERMINED" instead.

If this parameter is enabled globally (which is the default), rsync performs the lookup as soon as a client connects. Disabling it for a specific module will not avoid the lookup. Therefore, it is recommended to disable it globally and then enable it only for modules that require the information.

#### Attempted Solution
To address this issue, I added the following line to the global configuration in `/etc/rsyncd.conf`:

```
reverse lookup = no
```

However, after stopping and starting the daemon, the following lines were added to the log file:

```
2013/02/08 12:47:17 [13675] Unknown Parameter encountered: "reverse lookup"
2013/02/08 12:47:17 [13675] IGNORING unknown parameter "reverse lookup"
2013/02/08 12:47:17 [13676] rsyncd version 3.0.7 starting, listening on port 873
```

#### Version Information
The version of rsync installed on my server is:

```
rsync  version 3.0.7  protocol version 30
```

#### Conclusion
The `reverse lookup` parameter is only available in the upcoming 3.1.0 release, as indicated in the NEWS for rsync 3.1.0 (UNRELEASED):

```
Added the "reverse lookup" parameter to the rsync daemon config file to allow reverse-DNS lookups to be disabled.
```

Therefore, the issue is due to the fact that the `reverse lookup` option is not supported in the current version (3.0.7). Upgrading to a newer version of rsync that includes this feature would resolve the problem.
