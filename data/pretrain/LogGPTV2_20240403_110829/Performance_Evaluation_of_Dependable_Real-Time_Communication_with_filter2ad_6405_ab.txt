Route selection  in  the  distributed  approach  requires to 
search  routes  and  perform  admission  tests  on  them  [7]. 
Generally,  the  search  and  test  is  done  at  the  same  time. 
There are two  approaches to finding candidate routes:  se- 
quential and parallel.  In the sequential approach, all possi- 
ble routes are checked one by  one until  a qualified  one is 
found or all possibilities are exhausted. Shortest routes are 
picked and checked first, sequentially one by one. Complete 
search of all possible routes could be very time-consuming. 
In the parallel search, all possible routes are searched con- 
currently  [7,9]. The flooding scheme [9] falls into the cat- 
egory  of  parallel  approach.  Although  this  scheme is  fast 
in  finding  a  route,  it  induces a  large  traffic  overhead.  A 
bounded flooding  algorithm [7] is proposed  to reduce this 
traffic overhead. 
2.1.2  Fault-tolerant communication 
Connection dependability is of great importance to many 
applications where service disruption has a serious negative 
impact.  When  a real-time channel is  disabled  by  a com- 
ponent failure, a new channel that does not run through the 
failed component should be established before resuming the 
data transmission.  However, such channel re-establishment 
attempts can fail because of resource shortage at that  time 
(as a result of network congestion or contention among mul- 
tiple  simultaneous recovery attempts).  Even when such a 
channel is re-established successfully, it may make a seri- 
ously  detrimental impact on  the  underlying application if 
it  takes a  long time.  To  handle  network  component fail- 
ures,  several  fault-tolerant communication  schemes  have 
been  proposed  [ 1,4, lo].  The  common  characteristic of 
these approaches is to use redundant resources. 
Fault-tolerant  communication schemes can be’classified 
as  active or passive.  In  the  active  approach, the  redun- 
dant  resources  are  always  used  for  actual  data  transfer. 
Multiple-copy [lo] and  disperse  [4] routing  schemes  be- 
long to  this category.  In  the  multiple-copy  scheme, more 
than one copy of each message are transmitted through link- 
disjoint  routes.  The more message copies are transmitted, 
the  more  resources  are  wasted  in  the  absence  of  failure. 
In  the disperse-routing scheme [4], a single message with 
error recovery  information  is  divided  into multiple  small 
messages which  are then  transmitted through link-disjoint 
routes. This scheme reduces the waste of resources, but still 
the redundant resources are actively used. 
In  the  passive  approach,  the  redundant  resources  re- 
served  for recovery  from component failures stay  inactive 
during the absence of failure, or the normal operation.  In the 
backup-channel approach [I], the network first establishes a 
primary channel, then sets up a link-disjoint backup channel 
for quick recovery from a component failure. Although the 
backup channels require reservation of resources, they don’t 
“consume” the resources until they  are activated as a result 
of component failures.  The amount of resources to be re- 
served for backup channels can be reduced by multiplexing 
multiple backups,  or overbooking resources.  The backup 
channel multiplexing  will  not  degrade the  communication 
dependability as long as not all of the backup channels are 
activated at the same time (thus not exceeding the resource 
capacity). The resources reserved  for backup channels can, 
in the absence of component failures, be used for transport- 
ing non-real-time traffic. 
2.2  Elastic QoS 
As mentioned earlier,  a connection’s performance QoS 
requirement is usually  specified  as a single value that rep- 
resents  the client’s bare minimum QoS requirement. Spec- 
ification  of higher performance QoS by a client may result 
in  the  network’s  rejection  of  the requested channel, or the 
blocking of  future real-time channel requests.  It  is there- 
fore desirable to specify each client’s QoS requirement with 
multiple values or a range, so that a channel, after its accep- 
tance  based  on its  minimum  requirement, can  (1) receive 
more resources and  hence higher QoS, if  more resources 
are available, and (2) release resources beyond its minimum 
required  if  there is resource shortage.  We  call  this type  of 
QOS  “elastic QoS.” 
There  are two  different models  for  elastic  QoS: range 
Qos  [5,  1l and interval Qos  [12, 131. In  the former,  the 
Qos  requirement is specified as a range that 
the value

ing the best performance. In the interval model, QoS is ex- 
pressed  in  the  form of  k-out-of-M within  a  fixed  time  in- 
terval,  meaning that at  least  k  but  less  than  or equal to M 
packets should arrive within  a fixed time interval.  The link 
manager can selectively ignore a packet as long as it can sat- 
isfy the minimum k-out-of-M requirement. The range QoS 
is applied to offline channel establishment and the interval 
QoS is applied to run-time channel management.

admitting a new channel or terminating an existing channel. 
There are two adaptation schemes:  one is  the  max-utility 
scheme [ 1 I ]  and the other is the coefficient scheme [5]. In 
the max-utility  scheme [ 1 I], each client specifies the utility 
value of his channel.  When more resources become avail- 
able, the system allocates these extra resources so as to max- 
imize the  system’s total  “utility”  or reward.  This scheme 
allows a real-time channel to monopolize all  the  extra re- 
sources even when its utility  is slightly higher than the oth- 
ers.  In  the coefficient scheme 
each client specifies the 
coefficient value of his  real-time channel.  When 
re- 
sources become available, the extra resources are allocated 
proportionally to the coefficient value of each channel. 
The range  QoS model  is  very  useful  for  fault-tolerant 
real-time  communication.  The  resources  reserved  for 
backup  channels  cannot  be  used  in  the  single-value QoS 
model,  although the  amount of  required resources can  be 
reduced using the backup-channel multiplexing.  However, 
in  the  range QoS model, these reserved resources can  be 
utilized  as  extra  resources  to  enhance  performance-QoS. 
When a backup channel is activated due to the occurrence of 
a failure, then all channels using the extra resources retreat 
their  QoS to their  minimum required.  This way, all  chan- 
nels can safely continue their service while at least meeting 
their  minimum  QoS requirements.  When  there  are  extra 
resources available  after activating  a  backup  channel,  the 
extra resources are re-allocated  to the existing channels. 
In  this paper, we  will focus on the performance evalua- 
tion offault-tolerant real-time channels, or DR-connections, 
with the range QoS model. 
3  The Performance Evaluation Model 
We  first  overview  the  overall  operation  of  DR- 
connections with elastic QoS. We then discuss the network 
performance modeling  and  propose  an  evaluation  model. 
Finally, we discuss how to obtain the parameters needed to 
analyze the model. 
3.1  Network Operation 
A client requests a DR-connection with the specification 
of  his  traffic-generation  characteristics and  QoS require- 
ments.  The QoS requirements consist of two parts:  perfor- 
mance and dependability QoS. The performance QoS can 
be presented in various forms such as packet-delivery dead- 
line, maximum network  delay,  or bandwidth.  We  assume 
that one form of performance QoS can be transformed into 
another, and vice versa. To guarantee a given delivery dead- 
line, the  maximum  network  delay should  be  less  than  the 
difference between the issuance time and deadline of each 
packet.  Also,  to  limit  the  network delay  below  a  certain 
value,  one must  reserve  enough network resources  in  ad- 
vance.  We assume that  the performance-QoS requirement 
is given in the form of bandwidth. (This is not a restriction 
performhnce-QoS parameters,) 
because  as mentioned above, it can be  converted to  other 
The  elastic  QoS  model  adopted  here  is  the  min-max 
range  QoS  model.  The  client  specifies  the  minimum 
bandwidth  required  to  satisfy  the  minimum  performance 
QoS requirement, the maximum bandwidth used to achieve 
the  best  performance  QoS,  and  the  utilityheward  he  will 
achieve when extra resources are allocated. 
The dependability QoS is presented as single-value QoS 
and used to guarantee that each DR-connection is assigned 
to have one backup channel even if  component failures oc- 
cur in the network. 
When  a  client requests  a  new  DR-connection,  the  net- 
work floods, within a bounded region around the client, the 
request to find routes from the source to the destination that 
have enough  resources  to  meet  the  connection’s QoS re- 
quirement.  Any node that received this request tries to for- 
ward it with its bandwidth allowance to all of its neighbors 
except the node which  the request came from. However, if 
there is not enough bandwidth to be allocated to the newly- 
requested  connection,  or  a  request  copy  received  earlier2 
has a better bandwidth allowance, the new request copy will 
be discarded. Those request copies that exceed the specified 
flooding bound will also be discarded. This floodingcontin- 
ues until there are no more copies of the request forwarded, 
or a certain time limit is reached. 
As  soon  as the  destination  node  receives a  request,3 it 
sends a confirmation message  with  a resource reservation 
request back to the source along the route in the direction 
opposite to that the request  had  taken  to reach  the destina- 
tion.  Each  intermediate node on the route reserves the re- 
quired resources as the confirmation message travels toward 
the source node. This first route is used as the primary chan- 
ne1 of the  requested  DR-connection.  The destination waits 
until  it receives more copies of the same request traversed 
different routes. If the route of the primary channel and the 
route determined by a request copy arrived later have better 
dependability QoS than  the required value,  the destination 
sends a backup channel conjirmation to the source along the 
second route in the reverse  direction.  This second route is 
used as the backup channel of the requested DR-connection.

mum  acceptable level of the  requested  connection’s Qos

will  be reserved  along the  primary-channel route.  If  not 
enough  resources  are  available,  then  each  link  on  the 
primary-channel path reclaims the extra resources allocated 
to the existing primary  channels of  other DR-connections. 
After  allocation of  the  minimum  amount of  resources on 
each link to the new primary  channel, the remaining avail- 
able resources will be distributed to all of the primary chan- 
nels on the link according to their utility values. 
The resource reservation for a backup channel is slightly 
different from that  for a primary  channel.  The link  con- 
troller/manager first  tries  to  multiplex  the  backup  of  the 
newly-requested connection  with  the  existing backups  on 
the link, i.e., sharing the resources already reserved for the 
other existing backup channels. This multiplexing is possi- 
ble only when no other backup channels need to be activated 
simultaneously with the new backup due to a single compo- 
nent failure that might occur somewhere else in the network. 
If this is not possible,  then  one must reserve additional re- 
sources for the new backup by using the same procedure of 
reserving resources for primary channels. 
When  a  component  failure  occurs  in  the  network,  all 
backup channels whose primaries traverse  the  failed  com- 
ponent must  be activated.  At this time,  all of  the  existing 
primary channels that share links with the activated backup 
channels should release  their extra resources allocated  be- 
yond their  minimum required, since some of  the extra re- 
sources  are reserved  for the  backups  to  be  activated  (but 
temporarily  borrowed by primary channels to enhance their 
QoS). After the activation of backup channels, the extra re- 
sources that still remain available are distributed  to the ex-
