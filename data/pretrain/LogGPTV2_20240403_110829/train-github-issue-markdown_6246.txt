When a trait `T` implements another trait `U` (i.e., `trait T: U { ... }`), it is possible to implicitly coerce a reference to `T` (`&T`) into a reference to `U` (`&U`). For more details, please refer to [RFC 401](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0401-coercions-for-generics.md). This feature is part of [issue #18469](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18469).
