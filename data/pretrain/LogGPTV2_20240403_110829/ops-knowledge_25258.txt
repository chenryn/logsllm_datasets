User: Please introduce several common file types in the Linux file system, how to view and manage them using command line tools?
Assistant: Several common file types in the Linux file system include: 1. Ordinary files: contain text, binary data, programs, etc., and can be viewed and edited through command line tools. For example: txt, sh, exe, etc. 2. Directory file: A container for storing other files and directories. You can view and manage internal files and directories through command line tools. For example: /etc/, /usr/, etc. 3. Device files: represent hardware devices or virtual devices, semaphores, etc., and can operate devices or read and write data through command line tools. For example: /dev/null, /dev/zero, etc. 4. Symbolic link file: It is a pointer to another file or directory, and the command line tool can be used to follow the link to reach the pointed file or directory. For example: /usr/bin/python -> python3.6 etc. 5. Socket file: A file type used for inter-process communication, which can be viewed and connected through command-line tools. For example: /var/run/docker.sock, etc. 6. Named pipe file: A file type used to transfer data between processes, which can be created and connected through command line tools. For example: /tmp/my_fifo etc. Command-line tools usually use the ls command to view a file list, use the cd command to enter a directory, use the cp and mv commands to copy and move files, use the rm command to delete files, use the mkdir command to create directories, and use the mount and umount commands to mount and unmount device files , Use the ln command to create a link file, use the mkfifo command to create a named pipe file, use the stat command to view file attributes, use the file command to view the file type, use the chmod and chown commands to modify file permissions and owners, etc.
