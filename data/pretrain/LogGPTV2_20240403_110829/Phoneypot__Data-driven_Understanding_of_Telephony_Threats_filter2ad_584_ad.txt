research, the goal of threat information collection and analysis
is to develop defenses that can help contain these threats. We
need to do the same with the intelligence that can be derived
from Phoneypot. We will explore several options, ranging from
associating reputation with phone numbers similar to IP and
domain name reputation, and black and whitelists of phone
numbers. However, spooﬁng of phone numbers is much easier
and has been detected. Our future work will address how best
to utilize Phoneypot intelligence to detect such spooﬁng.
X. CONCLUSION
Cyber criminals are now using vulnerabilities in the IP tele-
phony ecosystem to craft attacks that use legitimate sounding
phone calls to scam users. Such incidents are increasing at
an alarming rate. There exist self-reported fraud complaint
databases of unsolicited calls like 800notes and the FTC’s
complaint datasets. However, in this paper, we demonstrate
the need to enhance such databases to address problems such
as delay between when the actual fraud call date & time and
when the complaint was registered, lack of intelligence and
the accuracy of the reports due to inclusion of other abuse like
email spam reports that corrupt the datasets.
We explored the feasibility of using a honeypot to col-
lect better intelligence about telephony attacks. We propose
Phoneypot, a ﬁrst and the largest telephony honeypot and
demonstrate a concrete implementation for it. Such a tele-
phony honeypot must address several new challenges and
we introduce phoneytokens to illustrate them. We also report
experiences with 39K phoneytokens that were deployed and
data collected over a seven week period. Phoneypot received
more than 1.3M unsolicited calls. We were able to investigate
and validate some of these calls with FTC complaint datasets
and a proprietary database from robocall blocking service
provided by Nomorobo. We also found that older block of
numbers tend to receive more calls as compared to newer
block of numbers. We also observed evidence of abuse patterns
including debt collector and telemarketing calls patterns. We
have seen clear evidence of telephony denial of service attacks.
Finally, we compared the timestamps of phone numbers reports
on FTC fraud complaint database and found that there were
many instances where Phoneypot received calls from fraudu-
lent phone numbers before it was reported on the FTC dataset.
This shows that Phoneypot can be used to complement current
data collection mechanisms related to telephony abuse.
Many issues related to telephony threats remain to be
explored. In future, we will explore seeding of phoneytokens
as well as defenses against various threats.
