User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Authentication even with incomplete password When one enters a password to access one's online account, one has to type out the complete password, and submit it to be authenticated. If the password is very long, and if the account is accessed regularly, it will be very tiring to type out the full password over and over again.

Are there any schemes where the user types in a long password, and at every keystroke, the server checks whether or not the password provided so far is satisfactory? If it is satisfactory, the system logs the user in before the user finishes typing the password.

Do such schemes exist?

Assistant: Not sure I understand exactly what it is you are proposing. But unless I misunderstand you completely it would be a security disaster:


If the server gives any kind of indication (if only just in the time it takes for it to respond) if an individual character was correct or not it makes the password much easier to brute force, since you can just do it letter by letter. You end up having to make l*n attemps instead of l^n, where l is the length and n is the size of the alphabet.
If the server lets you in after just half a password you have negated the whole benefit of having a long password. As techraf comments: Your scheme is called "a shorter password".
You can not hash the passwords if you want to be able to check them character by character. That makes safe password storage an impossibility. (Well, you could hash them a ltter at a time but then we are back at the brute forcing problem.)
