• “Legacy 125-kilohertz proximity technology is still in place at around 
70% to 80% of all physical access control deployments in the U.S. 
and it will be a long time” - Stephane Ardiley, HID Global. 
• “There is no security, they’ve been hacked, there’s no protection of 
data, no privacy, everything is in the clear and it’s not resistant to 
sniffing or common attacks.”

How a Card Is Read

P O I N T S  O F  A T T A C K 
Card 
Reader 
Controller 
Wiegand output 
Host PC 
Ethernet 
Card 
• Broadcasts 26-37 bit card number 
Reader 
• Converts card data to “Wiegand Protocol” 
for transmission to the controller  
• No access decisions are made by reader 
Controller 
• Binary card data “format” is decoded  
• Makes decision to grant access (or not) 
Host PC 
• Add/remove card holders, access privileges 
• Monitor system events in real time 
Badge Types 
8 
•
The data on any access card is simply a string of binary numbers (ones and 
zeros) of some fixed configuration and length, used to identify the cardholder  
•
HID makes different types of cards capable of carrying this binary data including:  
•
Magnetic Stripe  
•
Wiegand (swipe)  
•
125 kHz Prox (HID & Indala) 
•
MIFARE contactless smart cards  
•
iCLASS contactless smart cards 
* Multi-technology cards

Badge Basics

C A R D  E L E M E N T S 
Card – “Formats” Decoded 
• Card ID Number  
• Facility Code 
• Site Code (occasionally) 
*Note: if saw printed card number on badge, could potentially 
brute force the 1-255 facility code (for Standard 26 bit card) 
Badge Formats 
11 
HID ProxCard II “Formats” 
• 26 – 37 bit cards 
• 44 bits actually on card 
• 10 hex characters 
• Leading 0 usually dropped

RFID Security Resources

• RFID Security by Syngress 
• Not updated since July 2005 
• NIST SP 800-98 – Securing RFID 
• Not updated since April 2007

Defenses 
47 
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S 
•
Consider implementing a more secure, active RFID 
system (e.g. “contactless smart cards”) that 
incorporates encryption, mutual authentication, and 
message replay protection.   
•
Consider systems that also support 2-factor 
authentication, using elements such as a PIN pad 
or biometric inputs. 
•
Consider implementing physical security intrusion 
and anomaly detection software.

Defenses 
48 
R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S 
•
Instruct employees not to wear their badges in 
prominent view when outside the company premises. 
•
Utilize RFID card shields when the badge is not in use 
to prevent drive-by card sniffing attacks. 
•
Physically protect the RFID badge readers by using 
security screws that require special tools to remove the 
cover and access security components.   
•
Employ the tamper detect mechanisms to prevent 
badge reader physical tampering.  All readers and 
doors should be monitored by CCTV.

USA - Green Card Sleeve 
• Since May 11, 2010, new Green 
Cards contain an RFID chip 
• Tested Carl’s “protective sleeve”, 
doesn’t block anything. 
• False sense of security
