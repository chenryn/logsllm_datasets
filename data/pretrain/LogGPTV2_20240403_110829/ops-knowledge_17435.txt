User: I'm sure this is well documented somewhere, but I can't find it! I want to make my scripts portable to machines that may not have their Python interpreters in the same location. For that reason, I thought that I could just code the first line as #!python3 rather than with the absolute path to the interpreter, like #!/usr/local/bin/python3.
No doubt most of you understand why this doesn't work, but I have no idea. Although my lab mates aren't complaining about having to recode my scripts to reflect the absolute path to the interpreter on their own machines, this seems like it shouldn't be necessary. I'd be perfectly happy with a response providing a link to the appropriate documentation. Thanks in advance.
Assistant: env is a program that handles these sort of things. You should pretty much always use something like #! /usr/bin/env python3 as your shebang line rather than specifying an absolute path.
