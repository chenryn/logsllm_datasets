Select the appropriate instance type and geographic location, and follow the wizard's instructions to complete the configuration. 5. On the Security Groups tab, enable HTTP and HTTPS traffic for the instance. 6. Create a new key pair for the EC2 instance, download it to your computer and save it. Step 2: Install WordPress on EC2 instance 1. Install LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) stack on EC2 instance. 2. Download WordPress, extract it to the /var/www/html directory, and change file and directory permissions. 3. Create a MySQL database and grant access to WordPress. 4.

Step 3: Configure a domain name and bind it to WordPress 1. Select the Route 53 service in the AWS console. 2. Create a new public Hosted Zone and add domain name resolution records. 3. Point the domain name resolution record to the public IP address of the EC2 instance. 4. Change the URL of the site to a custom domain name in the WordPress admin panel. 5. Use SSH to access the EC2 instance and add a VirtualHost entry in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file to configure a new virtual host, and set the ServerName and ServerAlias fields to the custom domain name.
