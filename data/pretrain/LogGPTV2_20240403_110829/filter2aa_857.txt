Live Demo
Canned Demo
Windows Attack 01
URFUKED opens 
the windows  run 
dialog box using the 
keyboard shortcut 
“windows key” + R
In this demo it runs 
the benign 
command 
“notepad.exe”­ but 
any other valid 
command could be 
executed.
Windows Attack 01 (continued)
After opening the 
notepad.exe window, 
URFUKED types text 
into the window in this 
demonstration “attack”
Inspiration
Inspiration
Inspired by (Adrian Crenshaw) 
the IronGeek's:
Programmable HID USB 
Keystroke Dongle [PHUKD].
URFUKED overcomes the blind 
timing, and attack selection 
difficulties, by incorporating an 
RF transmitter and expands the 
concept to include multiple O.S. 
attacks.
[Adrian, I know you're here 
somewhere, Thanks! I owe you 
a beer.]
Interface Details
Using The Interface
First two lights 
represent O.S. to 
attack:
01=Windows
10=Mac
11=Linux
00=Mouse Attack
(for mouse attack the two 
attack lights represent length 
of attack)
These two lights 
represent the attack to 
perform:
00 = notepad message
01 = web page load
10 = download software
11 = rm ­rf
Easily expandable to 64 
different attacks.
Enter a “0”
Enter a “1”
Transmit Attack
Transmission Protocol
Transmission Frames
●3 Carrier Bytes (or more)
0xAA
●Command Sequence Number
0­127
●Command  Byte
Any value
●Checksum
Command Sequence Number 
+ Command Byte
Receiver continually “receives” bytes even when there is no 
transmission due to ambiant RF noise.  I use these frames to 
distinguish a transmission from noise.
Valid Frame Definition:
Transmission
●10 Carrier Bytes
0xAA
●Command Sequence Number
0­127
●Command  Byte
Any value
●Checksum
Command Sequence Number 
+ Command Byte
For reliability the transmitter sends the following command frame 10 
times for each command send button press.
x 10
Each command frame is repeated 10 times for redundancy­ the command is 
only executed once by the receiver even if multiple valid copies are received 
due to the Command Sequence Number.
