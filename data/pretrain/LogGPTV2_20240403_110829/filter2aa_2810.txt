Introduction
Technology v. 
The Law
‣
Becomes more advanced
‣
Changes day to day
‣
Thrives on growth and development
Technology
‣
Rare sweeping changes
‣
Slow to react 
‣
Hates all that is new and different
The Law
‣
Through the Common Law system laws are
‣
Stable
‣
Predictable
‣
Methodical
Why Can’t the Law be 
Different?
‣
Unpredictable viewpoint
‣
Cases have yet to reach appellate levels
‣
Cases haven’t been brought at all
Cause and Effect
Adoption and 
Perception of 
Technology
‣
Most attorneys don’t have a deep understanding 
of technology
‣
Judges are even worse
‣
Attorneys come from diverse backgrounds
Who are We Talking 
About?
‣
Most students used laptops
‣
Most use Windows XP
‣
Most use Internet Explorer
‣
Most don’t pay attention to sending their 
passwords in the clear
Recent Graduates
‣
Attorneys love email and Blackberries 
‣
All Federal Courts have electronic ﬁling
‣
Attorneys have a strong obligation to keep 
communications secret

Easy to use
‣
Easy to implement
‣
Especially for a small practice
Encryption
‣
Ok, John.  Nice to know you have encrypted 
your message to our little "Family"  
‣
 BTW:  Like we need to worry that "Homeland 
Security" will now be watching because you 
posted to this little "House"? 
Understanding
‣
Operate on the front lines
‣
Require excellent advocacy skills
‣
Working understanding of facts
Trial Attorneys
‣
Substitute teacher 
‣
Risk of injury to a minor
‣
Exposure to pornography
The Amero Trial
‣
Willfully or unlawfully causes
‣
A child under 16
‣
To be placed in a situation where the morals of 
that child are likely to be impaired
‣
Shall be punished
The Statute
‣
Willful means deliberately or intentionally
‣
Not a standard of negligence
‣
If she was negligent, she would not be 
convicted
Elements
‣
“Were there any other images that had been 
placed on your hard drive on the day before 
that you saw at least in the ﬁle format?”
‣
"Did she log onto any programs?"
‣
“Speciﬁcally to what I am pointing at here, 
my understanding is this http://
www.vaginalcumshots.com, speciﬁcally this 
website, again, was accessed to that PC in 
Mr. Napp’s classroom, correct?”
Prosecution 
Highlights
‣
“Were any of the adware, spyware, parasite 
and viruses updated on or before October 
19th?”
‣
“I’m computer illiterate.”
Defense Highlights
‣
Before checking ﬁrewall logs checked after 
the computer was accessed by IT
‣
Computer not taken out of service for a 
week
Evidentiary Pitfalls
‣
Police investigator
‣
Q:  "Did you examine the hard drive for 
spyware, viruses or parasites?"
‣
A:  No
Evidentiary Pitfalls
‣
District still runs Windows 95 and 98
‣
Antivirus protection only
‣
Filtering software wasn’t updated
Failings of the 
District
‣
Q: “Does spyware and adware generate 
pornography?”
‣
A: “I'm not aware that they do”
Failings of the 
District
‣
Procedure
‣
Not to be taken lightly
‣
Prosecution not given the material prepared 
by the defense expert
Why Was Some 
Evidence 
Excluded?
‣
Probably not
‣
Expert gave his conclusions
‣
Mentioned Adware & Spyware numerous 
times in testimony
Did It Make A 
Difference?
‣
Rude to the court
‣
Clearly angering the judge and prosecutor
Actions of the 
Expert
‣
Everyone
‣
District
‣
The State
‣
The Defense Attorney
‣
The Expert
Who Do We Blame
‣
Misdirected
‣
Blind rage against the judicial system is 
ineffective
‣
Work together
‣
Ensure this doesn’t happen again
Was the Response 
Warranted?
Where is the Case 
Now?
‣
Judge has ordered a new trial
‣
Anticipating more expert testimony to be offered 
(and admitted)
‣
What will the new outcome be?
‣
HD-DVD Processing Key cracked weeks ago
‣
Finally appears on Digg
‣
Takedown notices sent 
‣
Hilarity ensues
AACS v. The World
‣
Dissemination is a violation of the DMCA
‣
Takedown requests were valid
‣
Not a First Amendment issue
‣
Private companies may do as they choose
Cold Facts
‣
Landscape signiﬁcantly different than it was 
when DeCSS was released
‣
Copyright holders must ﬁnd more effective 
ways of rights protection
‣
User driven sites must be ready to respond
The Reality
Torrentspy
‣
Torrentspy hosts torrent ﬁles
‣
Doesn’t keep logs
‣
‣
The fundamental issues separating law and 
technology aren’t going away
‣
Attorneys need to have a better relationship 
with technology
‣
Need for stronger advocates to prevent poor 
judicial decisions
