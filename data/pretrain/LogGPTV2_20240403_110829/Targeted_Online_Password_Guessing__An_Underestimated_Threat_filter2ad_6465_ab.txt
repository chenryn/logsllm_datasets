Without loss of generality, in this work we mainly focus on
the client-server architecture, the most common case of user au-
thentication, as shown in the right of Fig. 1. There are three
entities involved in a targeted online guessing attack: a user U,
an authentication server S and an attacker A.
User U has registered a password account at the server S. This
password is only known to S, though U’s passwords at other sites
may have already been publicly disclosed. S may be remote (e.g.,
an e-commerce site) or local (e.g., a password-protected mobile
device). To be realistic, we assume that S enforces some security
mechanisms such as suspicious login detection and lockout [14,18],
and thus the number of guesses allowed to A is limited (e.g., 102
[8,18]). A knows some amount of personal info about U, and may
be a curious friend, a jealous wife, a blackmailer, or even an evil
hacker group that buys personal info from the underground market.
As there is a messy mixture of multiple dimensions of info (see
Fig. 2) potentially available to the attacker A, it is challenging to
characterize A. We tackle this issue by assuming that all the public
info (e.g., leaked PW lists and site policies) should be available to
A, and then by deﬁning a series of attacking scenarios (see Table
2) based on varied types of U’s personal info given to A. This is
reasonable: (1) A is smart and likely to exploit the readily available
public info to increase her chance; and (2) A would use different
attacking strategies when given different personal info. Once A
has successfully guessed the password, the victim’s sensitive info
can be disclosed, reputation could be ruined (see [36]), password
account may be hijacked and money might be lost (see [26]).
Note that, here we only consider scenarios where A is with at
most one sister password of user U. The underlying reason is
that, among the 547.56M of leaked password accounts that we
have collected over a period of six years, less than 1.02% (resp.
1.73%) of them have more than one match by email (resp. user
name). Similarly, among the 7.96M accounts collected by Das et
al. in 2014 [12], only 152 (0.00191%) of them have more than one
match by email. Therefore, it is realistic to assume that most users
have leaked one sister password, and A can exploit U’s this sister
password for attacking.
3. HUMAN BEHAVIORS OF PASSWORD
CREATION
Here we report a large-scale empirical study of human behaviors
in creating passwords, in particular, how often they choose popular
passwords, how often to reuse passwords, how often to make use
of their own PII.
3.1 Our datasets
Our evaluation builds on ten large real-world password datasets
(see Table 3), including ﬁve from English sites and ﬁve from
Chinese sites. They were hacked by attackers or leaked by insiders,
and disclosed publicly on the Internet, and some of them have been
used in trawling password models [13, 19, 21]. Rootkit initially
contains 71,228 passwords hashed in MD5, and we recover 97.46%
of them by using our TarGuess-IV and various trawling guessing
models [21, 30] in one week.
In total, these datasets consist of
95.83 million plain-text passwords and cover various popular web
services. The role of each dataset will be speciﬁed in Sec. 5.
In particular, two of these ten password datasets contain various
types of PII as shown in Table 4. Besides, we further employ two
auxiliary PII datasets, aiming to augment the password datasets
by matching the email address to facilitate a more comprehensive
understanding of the role of PII in user-chosen passwords. While
most of the PII attributes in Chinese PII-associated datasets are
available, 17.90% of names and 54.04% of birthdays in Rootkit
are null. These missing attributes may hinder the effectiveness of
targeted attacks against Rootkit users. To the best of knowledge,
our corpus is the largest and most diversiﬁed ever collected for
evaluating the security threat of targeted online guessing.
3.2 Popular passwords
Table 5 shows how often users from different services choose
popular passwords. It is disturbing that 0.79%(cid:24)10.44% of user-
chosen passwords can be guessed by just using the top 10 pass-
words. Generally, top Chinese passwords are more concentrated
than English ones [34], which may imply that the former would be

more prone to online guessing. While most of the top Chinese pass-
words are only made of simple digits, popular English ones tend to
be meaningful letter strings or keyboard patterns. Love plays an
important role — iloveyou and princess are among the top-
10 lists of two English sites, while 5201314 and woaini1314,
both of which sound as “I love you forever and ever” in Chinese,
are among the top-10 lists of three Chinese sites. Other factors
such as culture (see 18881888) and site name (see rockyou and
rootkit) also show their impacts on password creation.
lists as shown in Fig. 4. During the matching process, we ﬁnd
that 34.02%(cid:24)71.11% of Chinese users’ sister password pairs are
identical (and thus are eliminated), while these ﬁgures for English
users are 6.25%(cid:24)21.96% (see Sec. 5.1). This suggests that our
English users reuse less.
Figure 3: Fraction of PWs shared between two sites.
Fig. 3 illustrates the fraction of top-k passwords shared between
two different services with varied thresholds of k. Generally, the
fraction of shared passwords from the same language is substantial-
ly higher than that of shared passwords from different languages. In
addition, the fraction of shared passwords between any two services
is less than 60% at any threshold k larger than 10. This implies that
both language and service play an important role in shaping users’
top popular passwords.
Rockyou and 000webhost share signiﬁcantly fewer common
passwords than other pairs do. We examine these two datasets and
