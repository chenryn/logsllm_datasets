### Entropy and Throughput Analysis

The probability mass function \( p(x) \) for a random variable, such as throughput, satisfies the condition \( 0 \leq p(x) \leq 1 \). The entropy of a process, which is a measure of uncertainty, is inversely related to its predictability. A lower entropy indicates higher predictability.

To analyze the influence of location on throughput, we introduce the concept of location entropy, denoted as \( H(X|l_i) \), where \( l_i \) represents a specific location. This is defined as:

\[
H(X|l_i) = -\sum_{x} p(x|l_i) \log p(x|l_i)
\]

Here, \( p(x|l_i) \) is the probability mass function of throughput at location \( l_i \). We use a method similar to that in [28] to calculate the entropy of instantaneous throughput measurements from data collected during short drives. Both total entropy (Equation 1) and location entropy (Equation 2) are computed.

The geographic space is divided into grids of different sizes: \( 10m \times 10m \), \( 20m \times 20m \), and \( 30m \times 30m \). Each grid square represents a location, and the space is discretized accordingly. The average instantaneous throughput per drive per grid square is treated as a single independent random observation. Thus, each drive can produce at most one observation per grid square. The total entropy is computed for all instantaneous throughput measurements for both 3G and WiFi. The location entropy is calculated for each grid square and then averaged over all squares. The results are presented in Table 1.

From Table 1, it is evident that the total entropy of 3G is much lower than that of WiFi, indicating better predictability of 3G throughputs. The size of the grid squares has little impact on the results. Additionally, the location entropy for both 3G and WiFi is lower than their respective total entropies, suggesting that when conditioned on location, instantaneous throughput becomes more predictable in both networks. However, the degree of improvement is similar for both networks.

### Temporal Correlation

We also evaluate the temporal correlation of instantaneous throughput values. Figure 7 shows the autocorrelation for the long drive, highlighting the excellent temporal stability of 3G relative to WiFi. This contrasts with findings in [28], where the authors observed low autocorrelation in HSDPA throughputs.

Key observations include:
- WiFi throughputs can be zero occasionally (roughly one-third of the time) but can also deliver significantly high throughput (over 2.5 Mbps) roughly one-third of the time.
- When WiFi is available, it outperforms 3G approximately 90% of the time, with a median difference of 1500 Kbps.
- WiFi throughputs exhibit more variability compared to 3G, but this variability decreases when conditioned on location for both networks.
- There is good temporal correlation for instantaneous throughputs on both networks, especially for short lags.
- Slow speeds result in higher throughputs on WiFi, whereas 3G is less sensitive to speed.
- The correlation between WiFi and 3G throughputs is poor, indicating that diversity techniques could be effective.

### Summary and Conclusions

Our experimental measurements show that metro-scale WiFi and 3G networks exhibit different characteristics under vehicular mobility. WiFi experiences frequent disconnections but delivers high throughput when connected. In contrast, 3G offers lower throughputs but provides better coverage and less variability. A hybrid design that leverages the best properties of both networks opportunistically can benefit consumers with better throughput and reduce costs for providers by offloading expensive 3G traffic onto WiFi networks.

While our experiences are provider-specific, the general observations are likely to be consistent across other deployments. Future work includes improving handoff characteristics and TCP dynamics for vehicular WiFi access, and designing hybrid access methods that exploit the best of 3G and WiFi, particularly for interactive use.
