**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (Choose one): **BOTH**

**Kubernetes Version** (use `kubectl version`):  
1.5 (custom built from master)

**Environment:**
- **Cloud Provider or Hardware Configuration**: Azure
- **Operating System** (e.g., from `/etc/os-release`): CentOS 7.2
- **Kernel** (e.g., `uname -a`): 
  ```
  Linux ma-kub8ms0 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Oct 24 16:09:20 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  ```
- **Installation Tools**: Ansible + kubeadm
- **Other Details**:

**Description of the Issue:**
When passing the `--cloud-provider` flag to `kubeadm`, it is only propagated to the controller manager and not to the kubelet. This omission results in the failure of Azure Disk mounting and potentially other cloud-specific features. Additionally, the `--cloud-config` flag is not passed to the kubelet.

It appears that the kubelet can automatically detect the correct cloud provider (Azure) on its own, possibly by receiving a hint from the controller manager. However, if users specify a cloud provider via `kubeadm`, this setting should be explicitly passed to all relevant services. The automatic detection does not address the issue when no cloud configuration is provided to the kubelet.

To work around this, I currently use a custom systemd drop-in to override the `KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add an optional environment file (`/etc/kubernetes/kubeadm-kubelet-args.env`) to the `10-kubeadm.conf` drop-in. `kubeadm` could then write appropriate `cloud-config` (and other) flags to this file, ensuring that the kubelet receives the necessary configurations.
