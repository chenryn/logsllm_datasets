User: Please introduce a common load balancing algorithm, such as round robin, weighted round robin, least connection, etc., and its applicable scenarios, advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Round-robin algorithm: Round-robin algorithm is the most basic load balancing algorithm. It distributes requests to each server in turn according to the order of requests, and then starts to cycle from the beginning. The applicable scenario is that the computing power of all servers is relatively balanced and the number of requests is relatively small. The advantage is that the implementation is simple and the balance is good. The disadvantage is that it is easily affected by the insufficient performance of a single server, and it cannot be dynamically implemented according to the actual load of the server. Adjustment. Weighted round-robin algorithm: Based on the round-robin algorithm, a weight setting for each server is added, and requests are distributed according to the weight ratio. This algorithm is suitable for scenarios where the performance of each server varies greatly. The advantage is that it can be dynamically adjusted according to the actual situation of the server. The disadvantage is that improper weight setting will lead to load imbalance. Minimum connection algorithm: The minimum connection algorithm will allocate requests according to the number of connections currently being processed by each server, and allocate them to the server with the least number of connections first. This algorithm is suitable for scenarios where the connection takes a long time. The advantage is that it can avoid server overload, but the disadvantage is that it cannot consider the actual performance of the server. To sum up, it is very important to choose a load balancing algorithm that suits your business scenario. You need to choose a load balancing algorithm based on factors such as server performance, request type, and quantity, and make real-time adjustments.
