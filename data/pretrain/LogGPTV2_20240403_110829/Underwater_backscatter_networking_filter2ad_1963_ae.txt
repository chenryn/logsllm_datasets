wireless channel is directly proportional to the SINR, our results
demonstrate that PAB’s decoding approach can boost network
throughput and enable concurrent multiple access.
• Finally, it is worth noting that the SINR after projection is differ-
ent across locations. This is expected since the wireless channel
changes with location.
6.4 Power Consumption
Next, we would like to evaluate the power consumption of a PAB
sensor. We used the Keithley 2400 source meter [34] to measure the
current draw, and computed the power as the product of the current
and the voltage when the sensor is connected to a power supply. It is
important to note that in all our previous evaluation, the sensor was
powered remotely and that connecting it to a power supply (instead
of the supercapacitor) is only used in this section for accurately
measuring power consumption.
Fig. 11 plots the power consumption when the sensor is in idle
state (waiting to receive and decode a downlink signal) as well as
when it is backscattering at 100bps, 200bps, 400bps, 1kbps, 2kbps,
and 3kbps. The figure shows that the power consumption in idle state
is 124µW and increases to around 500µW for the different backscat-
ter bitrates. These power consumption numbers are in line with those
expected from the datasheets of PAB’s components. In particular,
the microcontroller, which is the most power-consuming component
of PAB’s design, draws around 230µA in active mode (i.e., when
backscattering), and the LDO draws around 25µA at the correspond-
ing current draw from the MCU. These current measurements are
obtained when the voltage into the LDO is 2.1V, making the prod-
uct of total current draw and voltage within 7% of the datasheets
specifications.
Interestingly, the measured power consumption in idle mode is
higher than the datasheet specifications. We identify two contributing
factors for this discrepancy. First, the MCU is not entirely in standby
Figure 10—System Performance with Concurrent Transmissions. The figure plots
the SINR before (orange) and after (black) projection at 8 different locations.
6.3 Concurrent Backscatter Transmissions
Recall that PAB enables concurrent backscatter transmissions using
the recto-piezo concept, where different nodes have different reso-
nance frequencies and where the receiving hydrophone employs a
MIMO-style decoder to deal with collisions. In order to test PAB’s
approach for enabling concurrent transmissions, we run experiments
where we designed one battery-free sensor to resonate at 15 kHz
and another to resonate at 18 kHz. We create an audio file for the
projector which transmits a downlink signal at both frequencies. We
vary the location of the two backscatter nodes across experimental
trials. The receiving hydrophone captures the concurrent backscatter
transmissions, downconverts them using their respective resonance
frequencies and applies MIMO channel inversion (i.e., it decodes by
zero-forcing through projecting on the orthogonal of the unwanted
channel vector [80]). We measure the SINR (signal-to-interference-
and-noise ratio) of each of the backscattered signals before and after
projection.
Fig. 10 plots the SINR before and after projection across eight of
the locations. We make the following remarks:
• The SINR before projection is less than 3 dB across all the trials.
This low SINR is due to the fact that the concurrent backscat-
ter transmission interferes at the receiver, even though it is pro-
grammed to resonate at a different frequency. Recall from §3.3.2
that this is due to the frequency-agnostic nature of backscatter.
We note that if the projector only transmits at one frequency, then
the SNR would be higher because the second recto-piezo would
not power up altogether. However, this would defeat the purpose
of enabling multiple concurrent transmissions via FDMA.

since it sets few pins to high (the pull-down transistor, interrupt
handles). Second, the LDO consumes similar power even when the
MCU is in standby. This suggests more room for reducing the power
consumption.
6.5 Applications
Finally, we show how a PAB sensor can be used to measure pH, tem-
perature, and pressure. Having demonstrated the powering up and
communication aspects of our design, we focus our evaluation on in-
tegrating sensing interfaces with the microcontroller and embedding
data into transmitted packets.
pH: As described in §5.1(c), pH measurements are done using a
miniprobe connected to the microcontroller’s ADC via a signal con-
ditioning circuit. The ADC samples the output voltage, transforms
it to a numerical pH, embeds it into the payload of a backscatter
packet, and transmits it from a PAB sensor. We verified that the
MCU computes the correct pH (of 7), thus demonstrating the cor-
rectness of our conversion and interfacing processes. We note that,
in this integration, the signal conditioning circuit was powered using
an external supply and used to amplify the probe’s voltage mea-
surements. Future iterations of the sensor design may eliminate the
power supply by incorporating an onboard battery or by leveraging
the harvested energy and duty-cycling the pH sensing process.
Temperature & pressure: As described in §5.1(c), temperature
and pressure measurements are done using a waterproof digital
sensor which directly communicates with the MCU using an I2C
interface. The digital sensor powers up by drawing current from the
MCU. Similar to the pH measurements, we verified the correctness
of this design through correct readings of room temperature and
atmospheric pressure (around 1 bar).
The above evaluation demonstrates the extensibility of PAB’s
design, its ability to interface with various sensors, and its potential
use for in-situ underwater measurements.
7 RELATED WORK
(a) RF backscatter & Rectennas: RF Backscatter has gained sig-
nificant attention from both the networking and the circuits communi-
ties over the past few years. Recent proposals have demonstrated the
ability to backscatter and harvest energy from TV [43], WiFi [1], and
LoRa [56] transmissions, all of which are radio signals and hence
cannot work underwater. Circuits researchers have also introduced
efficient energy harvesting designs called rectennas where the an-
tenna and the rectifier are matched to improve sensitivity and energy
harvesting efficiency [10, 86], as well as for tuning purposes [46].
PAB is inspired by literature in both communities and brings the
benefits of backscatter communication to underwater environments.
(b) In-body Communication: Similar to underwater environments,
the human body exponentially attenuates radio signals (since 60%
of the body consists of water). This has led researchers to leverage
ultrasonic piezoelectric materials for various in-body applications,
including imaging [69], medical implant communication [21, 36],
and neuronal sensing [62].
Recent systems have explored the use of piezoelectric materials
for backscattering ultrasonic signals inside the human body [21, 36,
62]. PAB is similar to these past proposals in that it uses piezoelec-
tricity to enable backscatter, but differs from them in its constraints,
design, and capabilities. Specifically, PAB does not enjoy the wide
bandwidth afforded by ultrasound piezoelectrics nor can it rely on
highly directional scanners available in the ultrasound range.14 This
precludes it from adopting the spatial or frequency diversity schemes
employed by ultrasonic proposals which enable them to scale to mul-
tiple sensors. To address these challenges, PAB’s design introduces
multiple innovations including recto-piezos and a MAC protocol.
Moreover, in terms of capabilities, because it relies on acoustic sig-
nals, PAB can operate over much longer distances than ultrasonic
backscatter, making it a more attractive solution for underwater and
ocean applications.
(c) Subsea IoT & Underwater Sensor Networks: Finally, our
work is related to a large body of research on subsea IoT and
underwater sensor networks [33, 42, 79, 81], including DARPA’s
Ocean of Things initiative [17]. It is well-known that the battery
life is one of the most important challenges facing this area of re-
search [33, 42, 63] and that wireless communication is the main
source of battery drain for many applications [61, 81]. Most exist-
ing underwater communication systems rely on acoustic or optical
transmissions [30, 68], which are known to be power hungry. To
overcome this challenge, some proposals considered the use of mag-
netic induction for charging and communication [2, 19]. However,
magnetic induction inherently suffers from a small distance-to-coil
size ratio; hence, practical implementations of this approach have
demonstrated a limited range of few millimeters to few centime-
ters [7, 57, 84]. PAB shares the motivation with this line of work and
combines the long-range communication properties of acoustic sig-
nals with the ultra-low power nature of backscatter communication
to enable practical ultra-low power underwater networking.
8 DISCUSSION & OPPORTUNITIES
This paper presents PAB, the first technology that enables underwa-
ter backscatter networking.15 The technology leverages the piezo-
electric effect to enable battery-free underwater networking. As the
research evolves, we envision it may be used in a wide variety of
applications such as ocean exploration, marine life sensing, and
underwater climate change monitoring. Below, we highlight poten-
tial development opportunities and discuss some of the challenges
ahead:
• Operation Environment: As the research progresses, we would
like to test and deploy the technology in more complex environ-
ments such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. While we expect the
same principle to hold in such environments, the mechanically
fabricated transducers need to be optimized for the corresponding
environmental conditions, including temperature, pressure, and
salinity. These settings are also likely to introduce new challenges,
such as mobility and multipath, which would be interesting to
explore.
• Transducer Tunability: Our design enables multiple access by
tuning the resonance frequency of a PAB sensor. In principle, the
14These systems employ ultrasound signals whose wavelength is few hundreds of
microns, i.e., 1000× larger than PAB’s acoustic wavelength. The short wavelength
enables building highly directional and compact ultrasonic scanners.

gain from FDMA scales as the number of nodes with different
resonance frequencies increases. However, the tunability of a
PAB sensor will be limited by the efficiency and bandwidth of the
piezoelectric transducer design. This motivates novel transducer
designs and MAC protocols to scale to a large number of nodes.
• Sensing Capabilities: Our evaluation demonstrates the ability
to remotely power up the sensors and achieve communication
throughputs of few kbps. The desire to increase range and data
rates motivates further research to reduce power consumption and
increase sensitivity, throughput, and deep-sea sensing capabilities.
