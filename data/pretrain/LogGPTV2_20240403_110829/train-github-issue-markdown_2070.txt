Using a german locale and the gtk backend induces and error in mmwrite. This
bug was already reported in `gh-1329` and the responsability of gtk was
alluded to in http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/902#comment:1.
This bug has however never been fixed. It might be a bug of gtk only, but I
submit it anyway here because it has devastating consequences when using the
scipy.io package.
Here is a test case:
    #!python
    import os
    os.environ['LANG'] = 'de_DE.UTF-8'
    import gtk._gtk
    def test_locale():
        from numpy import array
        a = array([[1.,2.],[0.,4.5]])
        from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix
        asparse = coo_matrix(a)
        # figure out a temporary file name:
        from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile as tempfile
        f = tempfile()
        name = f.name
        f.close()
        # mmwrite on that tmp file
        from scipy.io import mmread, mmwrite
        mmwrite(f.name, asparse)
        # read
        read = mmread(f.name)
        # compare
        print a
        print read.todense()
        from numpy.testing import assert_array_almost_equal
        assert_array_almost_equal(read.todense(), a)
    test_locale()
