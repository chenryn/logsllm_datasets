title:botconf2016 Rough Diamonds in Banking Botnets
Millions of computers are infected and become part of botnets every day. Our relatives and most of our friends are happily infected, but some of these bots are more important than others. Botnet herders are aware of that and when they don’t have enough resources they sell specific infections to other groups which will give these special systems the love they need. We call these systems “rough diamonds”. During this presentation we will give real examples about how some of these targeted attacks end up in credit card breaches and high-amount fraud transactions.
