**Title: BotConf 2016 - Rough Diamonds in Banking Botnets**

Every day, millions of computers are infected and become part of botnets. Many of these infections go unnoticed by the average user, including our friends and family. However, some of these compromised systems are more valuable than others. Botnet operators, or "herders," recognize this and, when resources are limited, often sell access to these high-value targets to other criminal groups. We refer to these valuable systems as "rough diamonds."

In this presentation, we will provide real-world examples of how these targeted attacks can lead to credit card breaches and large-scale fraudulent transactions.
