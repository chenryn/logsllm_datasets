Currently only the project tree reloads. But if a file was modified outside
vscode the working file is never updated. You have to close the file and re-
open.
So working files should have some sort of message that a file has been
modified outside vscode, and give the option to reload. But at the very least
the functionality to reload the project tree should also reload the working
files if they have been modified outside vscode
