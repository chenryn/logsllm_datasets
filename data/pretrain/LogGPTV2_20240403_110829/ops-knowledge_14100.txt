User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题500 error after dragging joomla website out of subdirectory I recently dragged a website I built with joomla out of a subdirectory and now the whole website just shows a 500 internal error, can't even log into the backend.  I've already tried changing the log and tmp path variables in the configuration.php file with no luck.  any help as to what could be causing this?

Assistant: You haven't specified a Joomla! version but this is our current check list for migrating a Joomla! 2.5.x websites to a live location:


fix the configuration.php file settings for tmp &amp; log directories.
Clean out the cache directories
check the permissions on:


.htaccess
index.php and /administrator/index.php
make sure folders are 755 and files 644 or lower



We do these steps on any move not just ones where we end up with a server error.

If those steps don't rectify (usually do for 99% of 500 errors) check the Apache error log to see if there are any clues to the root cause of the problem.

If you find something in the log you're not clear on add it to your question so people can provide further help.
