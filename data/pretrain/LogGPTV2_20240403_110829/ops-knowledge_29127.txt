User: I am running a python interpreter through emacs. I often find myself running python scripts and wishing I could terminate them without killing the entire buffer. That is because I do not want to import libraries all over again...
Is there a way to tell python to stop executing a script and give me a prompt?
Assistant: Try using keyboard interrupt which comint send to the interpreter through C-cC-c.
I generally hold down the C-c until it the prompt returns.
