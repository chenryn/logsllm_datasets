**Analysis:**

1. **No Exception Detected:**
   - The log entry is an informational message (INFO level) and does not indicate any errors or exceptions.
   
2. **Log Content:**
   - The log records the active base files used by the `nova` compute manager when it uses `libvirt` to manage the image cache.
   - The specific path mentioned in the log is `/var/lib/nova/instances/_base/a489c868f0c37da93b76227c91bb03908ac0e742`.

3. **Service Status:**
   - This information is part of the normal operational status and can be considered a standard service record.
   - It indicates that the image cache is functioning as expected, and no action is required based on this log entry.

**Recommendations:**

- **Monitoring:**
  - Continue to monitor the logs for any changes or new entries that might indicate issues.
  
- **Documentation:**
  - Ensure that the log monitoring and analysis process is well-documented, including the steps to identify and handle different types of log entries.
  
- **Alerts:**
  - If not already in place, consider setting up alerts for critical or error-level messages to ensure timely response to potential issues.

- **Regular Audits:**
  - Periodically review the logs to ensure that the system is operating within expected parameters and to identify any trends or anomalies.

By following these recommendations, you can maintain the health and stability of your `nova` compute environment.
