with respect to the changing network conditions. STCP [36]
changes to a ﬁxed MIMD algorithm. FAST [31] uses queue-
ing delay, like TCP Vegas [6], instead of packet loss, as
its primary congestion signal and improves Vegas’ Additive-
Increase-Additive-Decrease policy with a proportional con-
troller. BIC [67, 59] adds a binary search phase into the
standard TCP to probe the available bandwidth in a log-
arithmic manner. LTCP [5] layers congestion control of
two scales for high speed, large RTT networks. TCP West-
wood [8] enhances the loss-based congestion detector using
more robust bandwidth estimation techniques. All these
end-to-end schemes do not need explicit feedback. There-
fore, it is hard for them to achieve both low persistent bottle-
neck queue length and almost zero congestion-caused packet
loss rate. VCP does need explicit two-bit ECN but is able to
maintain low queue and almost zero loss. However, it is un-
clear whether these end-to-end schemes, if given AQM/ECN
support from network, can achieve similar performance as
VCP in high BDP networks.
Analytical Results: The nonlinear optimization frame-
work [37, 48, 41] provides the above schemes a uniﬁed the-
oretic underpin and proposes a class of control algorithms.
The local stability of the algorithms when homogeneous de-
lay is present is considered by [32, 62] and then extended to
the case of heterogeneous delays by [50]. The local stability
of a modiﬁed algorithm for the case of heterogeneous delays
is proved by [70], which establishes a model that is similar
to what we show in Section 5. In contrast, a global stabil-
ity result is obtained in this paper for the case of a single
bottleneck with homogeneous delays. The global stability of
more general congestion controllers are considered by other
researchers, e.g., in [63, 12, 69].
Variable-structure control with sliding modes has a long
history in control theory [61].
It is useful when a set of
features are desired in a system but no single algorithm can
provide all of them. In computer networking areas, it has
been used to solve a traﬃc engineering problem in [43]. Our
work can be viewed as an application of this idea to network
congestion control.
8. SUMMARY
In this paper, we propose VCP, a simple, low-complexity
congestion control protocol for high BDP networks. Us-
ing extensive ns2 simulations, we show that VCP achieves
high utilization, reasonable fairness, low persistent bottle-
neck queue, and negligible packet loss rate. VCP achieves
all these desirable properties while requiring only two bits
to encode the network congestion information. Since it can
leverage the two ECN bits to carry this information, VCP
requires no changes of the IP header. In this respect, VCP
can be seen as an extension of the TCP+AQM/ECN pro-
posals that scales to high BDP networks.
To better understand the behavior of VCP, we propose
a ﬂuid model, and use this model to analyze the eﬃciency,
fairness, and convergence properties of a simpliﬁed version of
VCP. Particularly, we prove that the model is globally stable
for the case of a single bottleneck link shared by long-lived
ﬂows with identical RTTs.
As future work, it would be interesting to study what im-
provements are possible in VCP by using more than two
bits for the congestion-related information. One obvious
possibility would be to use a ﬁner granularity encoding of
the network load factor to improve the fairness convergence
speed. While in this paper we evaluate VCP through exten-
sive simulations, ultimately, only a real implementation and
deployment will allow us to asses the strengths and limita-
tions of VCP.
