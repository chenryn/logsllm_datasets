## Popping a Smart Gun
### DEF CON 25
**PI: [EMAIL]**

## What is a Smart Gun?
- A smart gun is designed to be fired only by authorized users.
- Various authorization/authentication methods include:
  - Biometrics (e.g., fingerprint readers)
  - RFID rings
  - Other technologies
- For a more detailed discussion, see "A Review of Gun Safety Technologies" (Greene, 2013). Note that Greene's work contains some inaccuracies regarding the smart gun we will discuss today.

## In the Movies
- **Skyfall**: An example of a smart gun in popular culture.

---

## Smart Guns: Prototypes and Market Availability
- Examples of prototyped smart guns:
  - iGun shotgun (RFID ring)
  - Kloepfer pistol (fingerprint)
  - Magna-Trigger/Magloc retrofit (magnets)
  - Safe Gun retrofit (fingerprint)
- Currently, only one model is available for sale in the US:
  - Armatix iP1 (NFC/RF watch)

## Why I Care

---

## Armatix iP1: Watch and Pistol

---

## Design Overview
- The system consists of two components:
  - **Pistol**
  - **Watch**
- The watch authorizes the pistol to fire.
- The watch must be in close proximity to the pistol for it to function.

### Signal Strength Scenarios
- **Scenario 1: Interference > Signal**
  - **Signal Strength vs. Time**
    - Interfering signal
    - Watch signal
    - Slicer level
  - **Explanation**
    - If the slicer level is set too high, no signal bits are recovered.

- **Scenario 2: Interference â‰ˆ Signal**
  - **Signal Strength vs. Time**
    - Interfering signal
    - Watch signal
    - Slicer level
  - **Explanation**
    - Interference fills gaps in the signal, leading to Manchester decoding failure due to missing edges.

- **Scenario 3: Interference < Signal**
  - **Signal Strength vs. Time**
    - Interfering signal
    - Watch signal
    - Slicer level
  - **Explanation**
    - Interference before the byte start causes incorrect byte synchronization, leading to decoding failure.

## Custom Test Transmitter Bill of Materials (BOM)
- **916.5 MHz Transmitter**
  - Murata TR1000 (same module used by Armatix)
  - Alternative options: SiLabs Si4430 ($5) or ON Semi AX5243 ($1)
- **Antenna**
  - Linx ANT-916-SP
  - Alternative: Short pieces of wire ($0.05)
- **Modulation Waveform Generator**
  - PIC16F18313 microcontroller ($1)
- **Stripboard Breadboard**
  - Cost: $1
- **Total Cost**
  - Optimal component choices: $5
  - As-built: $20

## Custom Test Transmitter Diagram
- **Components**
  - Antenna
  - MCU
  - Transceiver
- **Note**
  - Through-hole components are typically placed on the other side of the stripboard.

---

## Results
- The gun does not fire while the transmitter is active.
  - 100% effective up to 3 meters.
  - Some effect up to 10 meters, depending on pistol orientation.
  - Higher transmission power increases the range.
- For these tests, the watch was on the wrist of the non-shooting hand (approximately 10 cm from the pistol).

---

## Effective Range
- **916.5 MHz Transmission**
  - Effective up to 3+ meters

## (Demo of Denial of Service)

---

## Defense Mechanisms
- **Increase Transmitter Power**
- **Use Error-Correcting Codes**
- **Implement More Robust Modulation Techniques**

## FIRE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION
- **Why Have a Smart Gun in the First Place?**

---

## Unlocking Mechanism
- **Components**
  - Electromagnet
  - MCU
  - Ferrous material
  - Cam
  - Trigger
  - Firing pin with blocking lugs
  - Pin blocker
  - Channel for pin unblocking
- **Longitudinal View**

---

## Trigger Partially Pulled
- **Components**
  - MCU
  - Cam moves up
  - Trigger partially pulled, pressing on cam
  - Firing pin closer to being unblocked
- **Longitudinal View**

---

## Scenario 1: Firing NOT Authorized
- **Components**
  - Electromagnet NOT active
  - MCU
  - Firing pin remains blocked; gun cannot fire
- **Longitudinal View**

---

## Scenario 2: Firing IS Authorized
