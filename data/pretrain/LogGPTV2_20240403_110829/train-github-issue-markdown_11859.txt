Form fields rendered individually with form_widget(...) or form_row(...) are
re-rendered via form_rest(...)  
This issue is related to beta2 and was not present in beta1.
Example:
{{ form_row(borrower_form.contact_info.first_name) }} {{
form_row(borrower_form.contact_info.last_name) }} Phone Number  
{{ form_widget(phone_number_form.phone_type) }} {{
form_widget(phone_number_form.phone_number, { 'attr': { 'style':
'width:120px;' } }) }} ext. {{ form_widget(phone_number_form.extension, {
'attr': { 'style': 'width:40px;' } }) }}
When I call form_rest(...) at the end of the form, all of the above fields are
rendered again.
