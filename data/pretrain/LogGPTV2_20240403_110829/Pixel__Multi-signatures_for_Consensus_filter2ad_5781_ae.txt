Table 2: Total bandwidth to propagate a set of 4500 signatures
during consensus to agree on a block of transactions.
We clarify that the savings we obtain from Pixel are com-
plementary to those of Vault [42], which is another system
built on top of Algorand to improve storage and catch-up
speed. In particular, Vault can be used in conjunction with
Pixel to obtain further storage savings. Vault creates “jumps”
between blocks so that the system can conﬁrm block r know-
ing only block r − k for some parameter k (e.g., k = 100).
Instead of downloading every block, a catch-up node in Vault
only needs to download every kth block. Even using Vault,
users would need to download and store about 106 blocks for
every ≈ 13 years of blockchain operation.
Bandwidth Savings. Algorand uses a relay-based propaga-
tion model where users’ nodes connect to a network of relays
(nodes with more resources). Without aggregation during
propagation, Pixel savings for the bandwidth for both relays
and regular nodes come from smaller signatures sizes. Each
relay can serve dozens or hundreds of nodes, depending on the

resources it makes available. A relay must propagate a block
of transactions and the corresponding certiﬁcate (with 1500
votes) to each node that it serves. During consensus, however,
an additional 3000 supporting votes are propagated for every
block. Each node connects to 4 randomly chosen relays. Ev-
ery vote that the node receives from a relay, it propagates to
the remaining 3 relays. Duplicate votes are dropped, so each
vote propagates once on each connection. In Table 2, we sum-
marize savings for 4500 votes propagated during consensus
for each block. From the table, we see that a relay with 10
connections saves about 44% of bandwidth. Bandwidth can
be improved even further if Algorand relays were to aggregate
multiple votes before propagating them to the users.
Block Veriﬁcation Time Savings. Since verifying a Pixel
multi-signature requires only 3 pairings in addition to multi-
plying all the public keys in the signature set, they are faster
to verify than BM-Ed25519 signatures sets. Table 3 shows
that a set of 3000 signatures can be veriﬁed about 65x faster.
In Figure 4, we measure the overall savings on block veriﬁca-
tion time. Block veriﬁcation time is broken into three main
intervals: (a) time to verify vote signatures, (b) time to verify
vote VRF credentials, and (c) time to verify transactions. In
each interval, signature veriﬁcation dramatically exceeds the
time of any additional checks (e.g., check that the transaction
amount is higher than the user’s balance). Blocks with 1500
and 5000 transactions can be veriﬁed 38% and 29% faster,
respectively.
8 Conclusion
In this work, we focus on improving the speed and secu-
rity of PoS consensus mechanisms via optimizing its core
building block – digital signature scheme. We design a new
pairing-based forward-secure multi-signature scheme, Pixel.
We prove that Pixel is secure in the random oracle model
under a variant of Difﬁe-Hellman inversion problem over bi-
linear groups. Pixel is efﬁcient as a stand-alone primitive and
results in signiﬁcant performance and size reduction com-
pared to the previous forward-secure signatures applied in set-
tings where multiple users sign the same message (block). For

instance, compared to a set of 1500 tree-based forward-secure
signatures, a single Pixel signature that can authenticate the
entire set is 2667x smaller and can be veriﬁed 40x faster. We
explained how to integrate Pixel to any PoS blockchains to
solve posterior corruptions problem. We also demonstrate
that Pixel provides signiﬁcant efﬁciency gains when applied
to Algorand blockchain. Pixel signatures reduce the size of
Algorand blocks with 1500 transactions by ≈ 35% and reduce
block veriﬁcation time by ≈ 38%.
