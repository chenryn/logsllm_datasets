ror from different methods in open-air with human blockage.
Evaluation: Direction Derivation.
The localization de-
pends on an accurate estimation of AoAs. We ﬁrst evaluate
the accuracy of AoA inference. We considered both the basic
attack and the adaptive attack. We examine two methods to
derive AoAs: sine-wave ﬁtting (Section 5.1) and frequency
analysis (Section 8.2). The derived AoAs are used to compare
with ground-truth AoAs to calculate the AoA error (i.e., the
absolute difference between the two angles). Table 2 shows
the AoA errors for the OAH setting. These observations sug-
gest that a simple triangulation of AoAs cannot accurately
locate the spoofer.
From Table 2, we observe that (1) the sine-wave ﬁtting
method work betters than the FA method on deriving AoAs;
(2) the sine-wave ﬁtting method is able to get basic spooﬁng
signals’ AoAs accurately with an average error of 10.5◦ but
it is more difﬁcult to estimate AoAs under adaptive attacks
(with an average error of 29.6◦).

A Appendix: Spoofer Localization
With the ability to estimate AoA of GPS signals, we can
further infer the location of the spoofer with additional anal-
ysis. A naive approach is to perform rotation from at least
two different locations. Then we use the estimated AoAs
to locate the spoofer by simple triangulation. However, this
naive approach is highly dependent on the accurate AoA esti-
mation, which can be error-prone especially under spooﬁng
conditions. Instead, we perform AoA-guided navigation (an
adaptation of [43, 57]) to locate the spoofer.
Figure 17: Illustration of the spoofer localization algorithm.
The basic idea is demonstrated in Figure 17. At an initial
location T1, the GPS receiver spins locally to obtain an AoA
aoa1, then we move toward the AoA direction for a certain

Evaluation: Localization Accuracy.
To evaluate our pro-
posed method, we build a simulation framework (in MAT-
LAB), which allows us to analyze the localization results
without performing spooﬁng in a large outdoor space. In this
framework, a GPS spoofer is randomly assigned at a location
which is L meters away from the GPS receiver. Once our
system detects the spooﬁng signal, it will use the sine-wave

guided navigation method to locate the spoofer. Once the GPS
receiver is close enough to the spoofer (less than c meters),
the simulation is terminated as the spoofer is within view. We
record the number of steps it takes to locate the spoofer. In
an ideal situation where AoA error is 0, the number of steps
should be closed to L/d (where d is the moving distance per
step). Both AoA error and walking distance measurement
errors are modeled by a normal distribution (the mean and
standard deviation is set based on our measured data).
The experiment results are shown in Figure 18. We set
the spooﬁng signals to be generated by a basic attack and the
sine-wave ﬁtting method will be used to derive AoA. Then
we set the moving distance d to 10m, the threshold distance
for stopping searching c to 10m, and changes the L from 20m
to 100m. For each setting, 1000 simulations are performed
and the distribution of required steps is plotted as blue box
plots in Figure 18. The orange line connects the average value
of steps in each setting. Our observation is that as L changes
from 20m to 100m, the value of required steps for locating the
spoofer centralized in the range of [L/d − 1,L/d + 1], which
is closed to the results from the ideal situation where AoA
error is 0. These results suggest that the multi-step navigation
helps to rectify the AoA inference errors and converge to the
spoofer location.
B Appendix: Other Supporting Materials
We put other supplementary materials in this section. Fig-
ure 19 and Figure 20 are photos of our experiment setups.
Figure 21 shows the Radiation Pattern of an omnidirectional
dipole antenna with a metal plate as the blocking material.
With the blocking material, the Radiation Pattern can effec-
tively mimic that of a directional antenna. Algorithm 3 shows
the detailed process of the Spectrum Analysis (SA) based
spooﬁng detection method. The SA method is used to detect
adaptive spooﬁng attacks.
