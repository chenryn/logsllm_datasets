User: Working with Rasterbar libtorrent I dont want the downloaded data to sit on my hard drive rather a pipe or variable or something Soft so I can redirect it to somewhere else, Mysql, or even trash if it is not what I want, is there anyway of doing this in preferably python binding if not in C++ using Libtorrent?
EDIT:-->   I like to point out this is a libtorrent question not a Linux file handling or Python file handling question. I need to tell libtorrent to instead of save the file traditionally in a normal file save it to my python pipe or variable or etc.
Assistant: If you're on Linux, you could torrent into a tmpfs mount; this will avoid writing to disk. That said, this obviously means you're storing large files in RAM; make sure you have enough memory to deal with this.
Note also that most Linux distributions have a tmpfs mount at /dev/shm, so you could simply point libtorrent to a file there.
