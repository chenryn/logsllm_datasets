User:  What basic security settings do we need to make when deploying a new server?
Assistant: 1. Update OS and software: Start by updating your OS and software versions to ensure you have the latest security fixes and feature improvements. 2. Configure Firewall: Configure firewall to restrict network traffic to your server. Firewalls can be used to restrict access to certain IP addresses or network segments, and to disable port numbers that are not needed. 3. Disable unnecessary services: Make sure only necessary services are enabled. Uninstalling or disabling unnecessary services reduces the attack surface. 4. Encrypted communication: To ensure the security of network traffic, encrypted protocols such as SSL/TLS and HTTPS should be used. 5. Configure secure access: Make sure only required users have access. Strengthen remote access protection with strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. 6. Detect/prevent intrusions: Build an intrusion detection system and other tools and techniques to monitor servers for malicious activity. 7. Safe Backup: Make sure to make a safe backup of your data and restore it if necessary to prevent data loss or damage.
