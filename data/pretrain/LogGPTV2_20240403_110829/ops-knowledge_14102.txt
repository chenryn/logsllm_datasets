User: I'd like to tag some files on my Mac with Finder under a certain color tag, and then be able to get that list of files using a Python or bash script. Is it possible to get the list of tags associated with a file via the command line or a Python script?
Assistant: Late to the party here, but this is something that has been bugging me too â€” and I eventually came up with a run-round for tech-shy people that requires no line-command coding, just ordinary Finder commands and SimpleText. Try the following:

open a Finder window containing the tagged files and Select All
right-click on the selected files to get Contextual Menu and choose "Copy [x number of] files". If it doesn't say "Copy [x number of] files" but just "Copy [filename] you've accidentally deselected the files; reselect all, and try right-clicking again.
open SimpleText. Make sure that it is set to use Plain Text and NOT Rich Text. (Menu Bar: Format>Make Plain Text/Rich Text). If it is set to Rich Text, this technique will not work: you will get a document containing the actual files rather than a list of their names!
paste. This should paste a list of the filenames of all selected files, one per line, in the order in which they appear in the Finder. Hurrah!

Hope this works for you. It changed my life.
