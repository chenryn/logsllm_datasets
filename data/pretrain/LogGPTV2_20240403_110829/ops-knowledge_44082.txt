User: I have a python file which starts 2 threads - 1 is daemon process 2 is to do other stuff. Now what I want is to check if my 2 thread is stopped then 1 one also should stop. I was suggested to do so by cron job/runnit.. I am completely new to these so can you please help me achieve the goal
Thanks
Assistant: The best way out is to create this daemon as a child thread so it automatically gets killed when parent process is killed
