In the Find widget, the "Previous match" and "Next match" buttons have labels
which include their associated keybindings in parentheses. The "Replace" and
"Replace All" buttons in the Replace Input box don't display keyboard
shortcuts.
I looked into this a bit before creating an issue, and the solution isn't the
simple "look up keybinding --> add to label" approach that I hoped for. It
looks like Replace and Replace All don't actually have keybindings defined.
Instead, the keys are hardcoded into the `_onReplaceInputKeyDown()` method of
findWidget.ts.
I would like to see Replace and Replace All get configurable keyboard
shortcuts. The defaults would come from the existing hardcoded values, so the
core functionality would be unchanged. With configurable keyboard shortcuts it
would be easier to display them cleanly on the Replace and Replace All
buttons, and we get some flexibility as a free bonus.
I would like to implement this and submit a PR, but wanted to document and
perhaps discuss the issue first to make sure that sort of contribution would
be OK. Some comments in #406 brushed up against what I'm suggesting here, but
I didn't find any other potential duplicate issues.
