### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * 7.1.8
  * **Operating System:**
    * macOS Mojave
### Expected Behavior
A framerate of 20-30 fps when streaming `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
with `chromeMediaSource` = desktop
### Actual Behavior
We see a maximum of 5/6 fps instead of the 20-30 fps that we see when
streaming from Chrome via https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/Pluginfree-Screen-
Sharing/#4676396026610028
### To Reproduce
We use `RTCPeerConnection` and `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` to stream
the desktop. If we open `chrome://webrtc-internals` from within Electron, we
see a `framesEncoded/s` of 5/6 fps.
We tried to use this, but it did not improve:  
`app.commandLine.appendSwitch('webrtc-max-cpu-consumption-percentage=100')`
