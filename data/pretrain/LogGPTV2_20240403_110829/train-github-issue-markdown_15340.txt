The Playwright docs encourage the use of `launch_persistent_context` in
headful mode in order to include a browser extension. I have been attempting
to do this and struggling hard. While the code works flawlessly on my laptop,
GitHub Actions using xvfb are failing.
I've filed a ticket in the downstream Python library here. Logs of the error
can be found here. The relevant workflow file is here. The Python code that
launches the browser is here.
Here's my request: This core library should add a unittest that verifies that
the recommended use of `launch_persistent_context` with a browser extension.
This would be similar to the existing test that captures video.
