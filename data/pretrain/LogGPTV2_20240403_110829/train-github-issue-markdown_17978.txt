Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-manipulate-arrays-
with-pop has an issue.
The directions (including the comments) for this challenge are confusing. It
does not mention that the `var removed` should be changed in any way.

The end of this should probably read 'removed should contain the last value'
or something of the sort.
