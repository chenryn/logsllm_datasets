### Issue with Challenge: "Manipulate Arrays with pop"

The challenge located at <http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-manipulate-arrays-with-pop> has some unclear instructions. Specifically, the directions, including the comments, do not clearly state that the `var removed` should be modified.

**Current Instructions:**

**Suggested Clarification:**

To improve clarity, the end of the instructions should read:
"Ensure that `removed` contains the last value of the array after using the `pop` method."

This change will help users understand that they need to update the `removed` variable with the value returned by the `pop` method.
