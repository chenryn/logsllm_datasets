### Title: Black Hat EU-19 - Reverse Engineering and Exploiting Builds in the Cloud

Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) and containerization are fundamental concepts in today's IT landscape and are core to modern software development and operations. In this session, we will provide a concise introduction to CI/CD, with a focus on container builds, tailored for hackers, auditors, and all stakeholders involved in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Building on this foundation, we will delve into the security vulnerabilities of multi-tenant cloud build environments that utilize container-based build systems. Our discussion will be supported by real-world examples identified during the assessment of various cloud container build systems. We will demonstrate several new and lesser-known attack vectors, along with their corresponding remediation strategies.

This presentation aims to equip attendees with a deeper understanding of the potential security risks in cloud-based CI/CD pipelines and practical steps to mitigate them.
