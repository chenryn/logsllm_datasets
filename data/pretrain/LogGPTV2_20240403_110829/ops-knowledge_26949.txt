User: How to use Python scripts to monitor application logs, find problems in time, and provide corresponding processing strategies?
Assistant: Steps to use Python script to monitor application logs: 1. Install the logging module of Python, which can easily process log output. 2. Add logging statements in the application code to record various situations in the program, such as exceptions and errors. 3. Write a Python script to read the log files generated by the application, analyze and process the logs, and find abnormalities or errors. 4. When an abnormality or error is found, the Python script can take corresponding measures, such as sending an email or SMS to notify the operation and maintenance personnel to deal with the problem. The following is an example of a simple Python script that can listen to log files and send an error message to the specified mailbox when an "Error" string is found in the log: ``` import logging # Configure the logger logger = logging.getLogger( __name__) logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR) handler = logging.FileHandler('log_file_path') handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR) logger.addHandler(handler) # Monitor log files with open('log_file_path', 'r') as logfile: while True: line = logfile.readline() if not line: time.sleep(1) continue if 'Error' in line: # Send an email or SMS to notify the operation and maintenance personnel# ... ```
