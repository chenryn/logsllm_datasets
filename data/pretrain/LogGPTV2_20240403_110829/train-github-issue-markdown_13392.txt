Deno bundle is awesome, I can drop countless NPM tooling for a non-deno
specific project.
One question is how to generate typescript definition files from the bundler,
as that would provide the interfaces to code against the es module file
generated by the bundle command.
It seems that specifying a config as below has no effect.
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "declaration": true,
        "sourceMap": true
      }
    }
