User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题DNS configuration validation I am having issues migrating my current Active Directory objects to my new Domain using ADMT. I have gone to a lot of resources to resolve this issue and they seem to point to DNS. Is there a tool or command or something that can validate my DNS configuration is functioning correctly? The DNS server is a Win server 2000 and is the primary Domain Controller.

Assistant: Since DNS is platform-independent at the protocol level, I wonder if you have a Unix/Linux box somewhere you can run commands on?

You're after "doc", which does DNS audits by wandering around the zone, looking at records.  It's somewhat old, and it won't tell you it's leaving a log in log.&lt;zone&gt;, but it works.  It assumes that you have dig, from bind9, which you probably will, on any modern Unix.  ftp site

Another diagnosis tool is dnswalk, which is a sourceforge hosted project; since I can only post one hyperlink, I'll let you find that one.
