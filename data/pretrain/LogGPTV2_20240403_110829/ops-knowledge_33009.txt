User:  web application has performance problems. Please list possible causes of these problems and provide corresponding solutions.
Assistant: Reasons that may lead to web application performance problems include: 1. Front-end technical problems, such as a large number of HTTP requests, slow page rendering, and too many script files. Solutions: reduce HTTP requests, minify and merge JS and CSS files, use browser cache, reduce the number of DOM elements, etc. 2. The database load is too high, such as complex query statements, unreasonable database table design or incorrect indexing, too small database connection pool, etc. Solution: Optimize query statements, design database tables and query indexes, use caching and other technologies. 3. The server configuration is unreasonable, such as unreasonable web server architecture, insufficient resource allocation, lack of load balancing, etc., resulting in excessive server memory and CPU utilization, resulting in slow response. Solution: Use load balancing technology to transparently distribute requests to multiple servers, upgrade server hardware, optimize server configuration, etc. 4. Network problems, such as insufficient bandwidth, disconnection of network connection, etc. Solution: By optimizing server software or trying to use a content delivery network (CDN), etc. Note: Before determining the source of the problem, first consider locating the problem, such as log analysis, tracing requests, using performance optimization tools, etc.
