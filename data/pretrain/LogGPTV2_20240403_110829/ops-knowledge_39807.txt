User: I have been testing the taskqueue with mixed success. Currently I am
using the default queue, in default settings etc etc....
I have a test URL setup which inserts about 8 tasks into the queue.
With short order, all 8 are completed properly. So far so good.
The problem comes up when I re-load that URL twice under say a minute.
Now watching the task queue, all the tasks are added properly, but
only the first batch execute it seems.  But the "Run in Last Minute" #
shows the right number of tasks being run....
The request logs tell a different story. They show only the first set
of 8 running, but all task creation URLs working successfully.
The oddness of this is that if I wait say a minute between the task
creation URL requests, it will work fine.
Oddly enough changing the bucket_size or execution speed does not seem
to help. Only the first batch are executed. I have also reduced the
number of requests all the way down to 2, and still found only the
first 2 execute. Any others added display the same issues as above.
Any suggestions?
Thanks
