User:  Please provide a network defense plan to prevent malicious attacks and data leakage.
Assistant: Network defense plan: 1. Update and upgrade software and systems: Software and systems should be updated and upgraded regularly to fix possible loopholes and problems. 2. Multi-layer authentication: Use multi-layer authentication, such as passwords, keys, fingerprints or biometrics, to ensure that only authorized personnel can log in and access sensitive data. 3. Network interception: Use network interception technology to prevent threats to the network, such as DDoS attacks and port scanning. 4. Encrypt data: For sensitive or confidential data, encryption technology should be used to ensure that only authorized personnel can access it. 5. Firewall: Use a firewall to monitor network traffic and limit unauthorized access. 6. Security testing: Regularly conduct security testing on the network to find loopholes and make up for loopholes. 7. Employee training: Make sure employees are security aware and know how to identify and prevent potential cyber attacks. 8. Back up data: To protect sensitive data, back up data regularly to prevent accidental data loss or malicious attacks. 9. Network intrusion detection system: Deploy a network intrusion detection system to detect and prevent potential intrusions in time. In short, preventing malicious attacks and data leakage requires the comprehensive use of various measures, and it is necessary to constantly adapt to new technology dynamics and changes in attack methods to ensure network security.
