Users should be able to get datasets returned as [Sparse]DataFrames with named
columns in this day and age, for those datasets otherwise providing a Bunch
with `feature_names`. This would be controlled with an `as_frame` parameter
(though `return_X_y='frame'` would mean the common usage is more succinct).
