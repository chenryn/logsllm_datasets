second reason is that when a vendor temporarily wishes
to halt sales of an item with the expectation of selling it
again in the future, instead of de-listing the item and los-
ing all of the reviews and ratings that have accumulated
over time, the vendor instead raises the price to some-
thing prohibitively high in order to discourage any sales.
This is what we call a holding price. Holding prices are
particularly dangerous for our analysis, because they can
be in excess of millions of dollars. So, mistaking a hold-
ing price for an actual price just once could have dramatic
consequences on the overall analysis.
Dealing with holding prices Given a particular feed-
back and a set of observations of the corresponding prod-
uct listing, the objective becomes to determine which
observation yields the most accurate price for that feed-
back. Independent analysis (see Section 3.3) yielded two
different heuristics for solving this problem. In the ﬁrst
heuristic (Heuristic A), we dismissed observations of the
listing where the price was greater than $10,000 USD as
well as observations that showed prices of zero (free).
We then dismissed observations that were greater than 5
times the median of the remaining samples as well as ob-
servations that were less than 25% the value of the me-
dian. We manually observed thousands of product list-
ings and identiﬁed that only in some very rare cases were
the assumptions violated.
The second heuristic (Heuristic B) proceeded by re-
moving observations with a price >$10,000 USD, as
well as the upper quartile and any observations that were
more than 100 times greater than the observation cor-
responding to the cheapest, non-zero price. To under-
stand the effect that these heuristics had on observa-
tions, we calculated the coefﬁcient of variation deﬁned
as cv = σ /µ (standard deviation over mean) for the set

places we study.
of observations for each item listing and plotted its cu-
mulative distribution function.
Figure 4 shows that without any ﬁltering, about 5% of
all item listings were at some point sampled with highly
variable prices, which suggests that a holding price was
observed for this listing. Both heuristics produce rela-
tively similar ﬁltering; we ended up using Heuristic A in
the rest of the analysis.
After applying the ﬁlter, there is still some smaller
variation in the pricing of many listings which is consis-
tent with the ﬂuctuation in prices due to typical market
pressures but it is clear that no listings with extremely
high variations remain. 79,512 total unique item listings
were identiﬁed, 1,003 (1.26%) of which had no valid
observations remaining after ﬁltering, meaning that the
output of the heuristic was the empty set, the remaining
78,509 item listings returned at least one acceptable ob-
servation.
After ﬁltering the listing observations, we pair each
feedback with one of the remaining listing samples. To
minimize the difference in estimated price of the feed-
back from the true price, we select the listing observation
that is closest to the feedback in time. At this point we
have a set of unique pieces of feedback, each mapped to a
price at some point in time; from there, we can construct
an estimate for the sales volumes.
Results We present our results in Figure 5 where we
show the total volume, per marketplace we study, over
time. The plot is stacked, which means that the top line
corresponds to the total volume cleared by all market-
places under study.
In early 2013, we only have re-
sults for Silk Road, which at that point grossed around
$300,000/day, far more than previously estimated for
2012 [13]. This number would project to over $100M
in a year; combined by the previous $15M estimate [13]
for early 2012, and “ﬁlling in” gaps for data we do not
have in late 2012, appears consistent with the (revised)
US Government calculations of $214M of total grossed
income by Silk Road over its lifetime, based on Bitcoin
transaction logs. These calculations were presented dur-
ing the trial of the Silk Road founder (evidence GX940).
We then have a data collection gap, roughly corre-
sponding to the time Silk Road was taken down.
(We
do not show volumes for Atlantis, which are negligi-
ble, in the order of $2,000–3,000/day.) Shortly after the
Silk Road take-down we started measuring Black Market
Reloaded, and realized that it has already made up for a
vast portion of the volumes previously seen on Silk Road.
We do not have sales data for Sheep Marketplace due to
incomplete parses, but we do believe that the combina-
tion of both markets made up for the loss of Silk Road.
Then, both Sheep and Black Market Reloaded closed –
in the case of Sheep, apparently fraudulently. There was
then quite a bit of turmoil with various markets starting
and failing quickly. Only around late November 2013
did the ecosystem ﬁnd a bit more stability, as Silk Road
2.0 had been launched and was rapidly growing. In par-
allel Pandora, Agora, and Evolution were also launched.
By late January 2014, volumes far exceeded what was
seen prior to the Silk Road take-down. At that point,
though, a massive scam on Silk Road 2.0 caused dra-
matic loss of user conﬁdence, which is evidenced by the
rapid decrease until April 2014, before it starts recov-
ering. Competitors however were not affected. (Agora
does show spikes due to very imprecise feedback timing
at a couple of points.) Eventually, in the Fall of 2014,
the anonymous online marketplace ecosystem reached
unprecedented highs. We started collecting data from
Evolution in July, so it is possible that we miss quite a
bit in the early part of 2014, but the overall take-away is
unchanged. Finally, in November 2014, Operation Ony-
mous [38] resulted in the take-down of Silk Road 2 and a
number of less marketplaces. This did signiﬁcantly af-
fect total sales, but we immediately see a rebound by
people going to Evolution and Agora. We censor the
data we obtained from February 2015: at that point we
only have results for Agora and Evolution, but coverage
is poor, and as explained in Section 3, is likely to un-
derestimate volumes signiﬁcantly. We did note a short
volume decrease prior to the Evolution “exit scam” of
March 2015. We have not analyzed data for other smaller
marketplaces (e.g., Black Bank, Middle Earth, or Nu-
cleus) but suspect the volumes are much smaller. Fi-

nally, more recent marketplaces such as AlphaBay seem
to have grown rapidly after the Evolution exit scam, but
feedback on AlphaBay is not mandatory, and thus cannot
be used to reliably estimate sales volumes.
In short,
the entire ecosystem shows resilience to
scams – Sheep, but also Pandora, which, as we can see
started off very well before losing ground due to a loss in
customer conﬁdence, before shutting down. The effect
of law enforcement take-downs (Silk Road 1&2, Oper-
ation Onymous) is mixed at best:
the ecosystem rela-
tively quickly recovered from the Silk Road shutdown,
and appears to have withstood Operation Onymous quite
well, since aggregate volumes were back within weeks to
more than half what they were prior to Operation Ony-
mous. We however caution that one would need longer
term data to fully assess the impact of Operation Ony-
mous.
4.2 Product categories
In addition to estimating the value of the products that
are being sold, we strived to develop an understanding of
what is being sold. Several marketplaces such as Agora
and Evolution include information on item listing pages
that describe the nature of the listing as provided by the
vendor that posted it. Unfortunately these descriptions
are often too speciﬁc, conﬂict across marketplaces, and
in the case of some sites, are not even available at all.
For our analysis, we need a consistent and coherent
labeling for all items, so that we could categorize them
into broad mutually exclusive categories. We thus im-
plemented a machine learning classiﬁer that was trained
and tested on samples from Agora and Evolution, where
ground truth was available via labeling. We then took
this classiﬁer and applied it to item listings on all mar-
ketplaces to answer the question of what is being sold.
We took 1,941,538 unique samples from Evolution
and Agora, where a sample is the concatenation of an
item listing’s title and all descriptive information about it
that was parsed from the page. We tokenized each sam-
ple under the assumption that the sample is written in
English, resulting in a total of 162,198 unique words ob-
served. We then computed a tf-idf value for each of the
162,198 words in the support for each sample, and used
these values as inputs to an L2-Penalized SVM under L2-
Loss implemented using Python and scikit-learn.
We evaluated our classiﬁer using 10-fold cross val-
idation. The overall precision and recall were both
(roughly) 0.98. We also evaluated the classiﬁer on
Agora data when trained with samples from Evolution
and vice-versa to ensure that the classiﬁer was not bi-
ased to only perform well on the distributions it was
trained on. The confusion matrix in Figure 6 shows
that classiﬁcation performance is very strong for all cat-
