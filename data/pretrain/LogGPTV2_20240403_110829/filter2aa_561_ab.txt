# SMB Security and Attack Vectors

## Overview of SMB Signing and Encryption Requirements

### Non-DC Machines
| Operating System | SMB1 Client Signing | SMB1 Server Signing | SMB2/3 Client Signing | SMB2/3 Server Signing | Highest Version |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Windows Vista SP1 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 2.0.2 |
| Windows 7 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 2.1.0 |
| Windows 8 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 3.0.0 |
| Windows 8.1 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 3.0.2 |
| Windows 10* | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 3.1.1 |
| Server 2008 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 2.0.2 |
| Server 2008 R2 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 2.1.0 |
| Server 2012 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 3.0.0 |
| Server 2012 R2 | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 3.0.2 |
| Server 2016* | Supported, Not required | Disabled | Not required | Not required | 3.1.1 |

**Notes:**
- Domain controllers (DCs) require SMB signing by default.
- In Windows 10 and Server 2016, signing and mutual authentication (e.g., Kerberos auth) are always required on `\\*\SYSVOL` and `\\*\NETLOGON`. These settings are enforced through UNC hardening.

### Notable Exceptions
- **SMB3 Dialects:** If a client supports SMB3 and the dialect picked for the connection is between SMB 2.0.2 and 3.0.2, the client will always send a signed `FSCTL_VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO` message to validate the negotiated capabilities, GUID, security mode, and dialects from the original negotiation phase. This feature cannot be disabled in Windows 10/Server 2016 and later. This prevents dialect downgrades (except to SMBv1) and ensures that any signature/encryption support is not stripped.
- **SMB 3.1.1 Security Features:** SMB 3.1.1 uses pre-authentication integrity hashing to verify that all information prior to authentication was not modified. It takes the cumulative SHA-512 hash of every SMB packet prior to authentication and uses it in the SessionBaseKey generation process. If any data is modified, the client and server will not generate the same signing keys. At the end of the session setup response, both client and server must send a signed message to prove integrity.
- **Default Settings:**
  - Signing is not used by default except on DCs and when Windows 10/Server 2016 connect to `\\*\NETLOGON` and `\\*\SYSVOL`.
  - Encryption is only supported in SMB 3.0.0 and greater and must be manually enabled or required.
  - Every dialect up to SMB 3.1.1 can be downgraded to NTLMv2 if it is supported.
  - Signing and encryption keys are based on knowledge of the user’s password.

## SMBetray: A Tool for Attacking Weak SMB Sessions

### Introduction
The goal of SMBetray is to exploit the security gaps in weak SMB sessions from a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) perspective. The primary objectives are to steal sensitive data and gain Remote Code Execution (RCE).

### Challenges
The biggest obstacle was positioning the tool for optimal intercept. The ideal position is a fully transparent intercept/proxy that eavesdrops on the connection between the victim and their legitimate destination without causing disruptions.

### Existing Options
1. **Use of an Arbitrary Upstream Server:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Connection stability.
   - **Cons:**
     - Redirects requests, causing disruptions and losing the original destination information. HTTP MiTM servers avoid this issue by using the "Host:" header.

2. **Use of NFQUEUE for Kernel-Level Packet Editing:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Full transparency as packets are edited on the fly at the kernel level.
   - **Cons:**
     - TCP packet editing takes too long, leading to re-transmission and connection resets.

### Solution
SMBetray combines the transparency of NFQUEUE with the connection stability of an upstream proxy. The tool is built on `ebcLib.py`, a MiTM TCP proxy library.

### Attack Capabilities
SMBetray can perform the following attacks:
- Dialect downgrading and authentication mechanism downgrading.
- Passive file copying.
- File directory injection.
- File content swapping/backdooring.
- LNK swapping.
- Compromising SessionKeys (if credentials are known) and forging signatures.

### Countermeasures

#### Disable SMBv1
- Require SMB signatures across the domain on both clients and servers by enabling “Digitally sign communications (always).”

#### Require SMB Signing
- Ensure that SMB signing is required on all machines to prevent tampering.

#### Use Encryption
- SMB 3 introduced support for encryption, which can be established on a per-share basis or system-wide. Encryption can be either "supported" or "required."
  - **Supported:** Encrypts sessions after authentication but does not reject unencrypted connections.
  - **Required:** Rejects any unencrypted connection.

#### UNC Hardening
- Use Group Policy to push connection security requirements to clients. For example, setting `RequireIntegrity=1` on `\\*\NETLOGON` ensures that the client will only connect to the NETLOGON share if signing is used.

#### Audit and Restrict NTLM
- Audit where NTLM is needed in your organization and restrict it to those systems where it is necessary. Removing or restricting NTLM helps prevent authentication mechanism downgrades to NTLMv1/v2 for SMB dialects less than 3.1.1.

#### Kerberos FAST Armoring
- Require Kerberos Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (FAST):
  - Encapsulates the user’s Kerberos AS-REQ authentication within the machine’s TGT, preventing attackers who know the user’s password from compromising the Kerberos session key.
  - Enables authenticated Kerberos errors, preventing KDC error spoofing and downgrading clients to NTLM or weaker cryptography.
- **Precautions:**
  - Requires Windows 8/2012 or later throughout the environment. Setting FAST Armoring to “Fail unarmored authentication requests” will prevent older, non-FAST-supporting devices from authenticating to the domain.

#### Passphrase vs. Password
- Encourage users to use passphrases instead of passwords. For example, "5ome some stronger p@ssword!" is better than "D3fc0n26!". Stronger passphrases make it harder for attackers to crack passwords and compromise Kerberos Session Keys or SMB Session Base Keys.
