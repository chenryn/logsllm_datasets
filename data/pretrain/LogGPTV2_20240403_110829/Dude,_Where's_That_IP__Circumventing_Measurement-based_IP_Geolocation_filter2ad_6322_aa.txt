Abstract
Many applications of IP geolocation can beneﬁt from ge-
olocation that is robust to adversarial clients. These in-
clude applications that limit access to online content to a
speciﬁc geographic region and cloud computing, where
some organizations must ensure their virtual machines
stay in an appropriate geographic region. This paper
studies the applicability of current IP geolocation tech-
niques against an adversary who tries to subvert the tech-
niques into returning a forged result. We propose and
evaluate attacks on both delay-based IP geolocation tech-
niques and more advanced topology-aware techniques.
Against delay-based techniques, we ﬁnd that the adver-
sary has a clear trade-off between the accuracy and the
detectability of an attack. In contrast, we observe that
more sophisticated topology-aware techniques actually
fare worse against an adversary because they give the
adversary more inputs to manipulate through their use
of topology and delay information.
1 Introduction
Many applications beneﬁt from using IP geolocation to
determine the geographic location of hosts on the In-
ternet. For example, online advertisers and search en-
gines tailor their content based on the client’s location.
Currently, geolocation databases such as Quova [22] and
MaxMind [16] are the most popular method used by ap-
plications that need geolocation services.
Geolocation is also used in many security-sensitive ap-
plications. Online content providers such as Hulu [13],
BBC iPlayer [22], RealMedia [22] and Pandora [20],
limit their content distribution to speciﬁc geographic re-
gions. Before allowing a client to view the content, they
determine the client’s location from its IP address and al-
low access only if the client is in a permitted jurisdiction.
In addition, Internet gambling websites must restrict ac-
cess to their applications based on the client’s location
or risk legal repercussions [29]. Accordingly, these busi-
nesses rely on geolocation to limit access to their online
services.
Looking forward, the growth of infrastructure-as-a-
service clouds, such as Amazon’s EC2 service [1], may
also drive organizations using cloud computing to em-
ploy geolocation. Users of cloud computing deploy VMs
on a cloud provider’s infrastructure without having to
maintain the hardware their VM is running on. However,
differences in laws governing issues such as privacy, in-
formation discovery, compliance and audit require that
some cloud users to restrict VM locations to certain juris-
dictions or countries [6]. These location restrictions may
be speciﬁed as part of a service level agreement (SLA)
between the cloud user and provider. Cloud users can
use IP geolocation to independently verify that the loca-
tion restrictions in their cloud SLAs are met.
In these cases, the target of geolocation has an incen-
tive to mislead the geolocation system about its true lo-
cation. Clients commonly use proxies to mislead content
providers so they can view content that is unauthorized
in their geographic region.
In response, some content
providers [13] however, have identiﬁed and blocked ac-
cess from known proxies; but this does not prevent all
clients from circumventing geographic controls. Sim-
ilarly, cloud providers may attempt to break location
restrictions in their SLAs to move customer VMs to
cheaper locations. Governments that enforce location re-
quirements on the cloud user may require the geoloca-
tion checks to be robust no matter what a cloud provider
may do to mislead them. Even if the cloud provider itself
is not malicious, its employees may also try to relocate
VMs to locations where they can be attacked by other
malicious VMs [24]. Thus, while cloud users might trust
the cloud service provider, they may still be required to
cd ..have independent veriﬁcation of the location of their
VMs to meet audit requirements or to avoid legal liabil-
ity.
IP geolocation has been an active ﬁeld of research for
almost a decade. However, all current geolocation tech-
niques assume a benign target that is not trying to in-
tentionally mislead the user, and there has been limited
work on geolocating malicious targets. Castelluccia et
al. apply Constraint-Based Geolocation (CBG) [12] to
the problem of geolocating fast-ﬂux hidden servers that
use a layer of proxies in a botnet [5] to conceal their loca-
tion. Muir and Oorschot [18] describe limitations of pas-
sive geolocation techniques (e.g., whois services) and
present a technique for ﬁnding the IP address of a ma-
chine using the Tor anonymization network [28]. These
previous works focus on de-anonymization of hosts be-
hind proxies, while our contribution in this paper is to
answer fundamental questions about whether current ge-
olocation algorithms are suitable for security-sensitive
applications:
• Are current geolocation algorithms accurate
enough to locate an IP within a certain country
or jurisdiction? We answer this question by sur-
veying previously published studies of geolocation
algorithms. We ﬁnd that current algorithms have
accuracies of 35-194 km, making them suitable for
geolocation within a country.
• How can adversaries attack a geolocation sys-
tem? We propose attacks on two broad classes of
measurement-based geolocation algorithms – those
relying on network delay measurements and those
using network topology information. To evaluate
the practicality of these attacks, we categorize ad-
versaries into two classes – a simple adversary that
can manipulate network delays and a sophisticated
one with control over a set of routable IP addresses.
• How effective are such attacks? Can they be
detected? We evaluate our attacks by analyzing
them against models of geolocation algorithms. We
also perform an empirical evaluation using mea-
surements taken from PlanetLab [21] and execut-
ing attacks on implementations of delay-based and
topology-aware geolocation algorithms. We ob-
serve the simple adversary has limited accuracy and
must trade off accuracy for detectability of their at-
tack. On the other hand, the sophisticated adversary
has higher accuracy and remains difﬁcult to detect.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion 2 summarizes relevant background and previous
work on geolocation techniques. The security model and
assumptions we use to evaluate current geolocation pro-
posals is described in Section 3. We develop and ana-
lyze attacks on delay-based and topology-aware geolo-
cation methods in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Sec-
tion 6 presents related work that evaluates geolocation
when confronted by a target that leverages proxies. We
present conclusions in Section 7.
2 Geolocation Background
IP geolocation aims to solve the problem of determin-
ing the geographic location of a given IP address. The
solution can be expressed to varying degrees of granu-
larity; for most applications the result should be precise
enough to determine the city in which the IP is located,
either returning a city name or the longitude and latitude
where the target is located. The two main approaches to
geolocation use either active network measurements to
determine the location of the host or databases of IP to
location mappings.
Measurement-based geolocation algorithms [9, 12, 14,
19, 30, 31] leverage a set of geographically distributed
landmark hosts with known locations to locate the tar-
get IP. These landmarks measure various network prop-
erties, such as delay, and the paths taken by trafﬁc be-
tween themselves and the target. These results are used
as input to the geolocation algorithm which uses them
to determine the target’s location using methods such as:
constraining the region where the target may be located
(geolocalization) [12, 30], iterative force directed algo-
rithms [31], machine learning [9] and constrained opti-
mization [14].
Geolocation algorithms mainly rely on ping [7] and
traceroute [7] measurements. Ping measures the
round-trip time (RTT) delay between two machines on
the Internet, while traceroute discovers and mea-
sures the RTT to routers along the path to a given des-
tination. We classify measurement-based geolocation al-
gorithms by the type of measurements they use to deter-
mine the target’s location. We refer to algorithms that
use end-to-end RTTs as delay-based [9, 12, 31] and those
that use both RTT and topology information as topology-
aware algorithms [14, 30].
An alternative to measurement-based geolocation is
geolocation using databases of IP to location mappings.
These databases can be either proprietary or public. Pub-
lic databases include those administered by regional In-
ternet registries (e.g., ARIN [3], RIPE [23]). Propri-
etary databases of IP to geographic location mappings
are provided by companies such as Quova [22] and Max-
mind [16]. While the exact method of constructing these
databases is not public, they are sometimes based on a
combination of whois services, DNS LOC records and
autonomous system (AS) numbers [2]. Registries and
databases tend to be coarse grained, usually returning the
headquarters location of the organization that registered
the IP address. This becomes a problem when organiza-
tions distribute their IP addresses over a wide geographic
region, such as large ISPs or content providers. Mislead-

ing database geolocation is also straightforward through
the use of proxies.
DNS LOC [8] is an open standard that allows DNS ad-
ministrators to augment DNS servers with location infor-
mation, effectively creating a publicly available database
of IP location information. However, it has not gained
widespread usage. In addition, since the contents of the
DNS LOC database are not authenticated and are set by
the owners of the IP addresses themselves, it is poorly
suited for security-sensitive applications.
Much research has gone into improving the accuracy
of measurement-based geolocation algorithms; conse-
quently, they provide fairly reliable results. Table 1
shows the reported average accuracies of recently pro-
posed geolocation algorithms. Based on the reported ac-
curacies, we believe that current geolocation algorithms
are sufﬁciently accurate to place a machine within a
country or jurisdiction. In particular, CBG [12] and Oc-
tant [30] appear to offer accuracies well within the size
of most countries and may even be able to place users
within a metropolitan area. Measurement-based geoloca-
tion is particularly appealing for secure geolocation be-
cause if a measurement can reach the target (e.g., using
application layer measurements [17]), even if it is behind
a proxy (e.g., SOCKS or HTTP proxy), the effectiveness
of proxying will be diminished.
3 Security Model
We model secure geolocation as a three-party problem.
First, there is the geolocation user or victim. The user
hopes to accurately determine the location of the target
using a geolocation algorithm that relies on measure-
ments of network properties1. We assume that; (1) the
user has access to a number of landmark machines dis-
tributed around the globe to make measurements of RTTs
and network paths, and (2) the user trusts the results of
measurements reported by landmarks. Second, there is
the adversary, who owns the target’s IP address. The ad-
versary would like to mislead the user into believing that
the target is at a forged location of the adversary’s choos-
ing, when in reality the target is actually located at the
true location. The adversary is responsible for physically
connecting the target IP address to the Internet, which
allows them to insert additional machines or routers be-
tween the target and the Internet. The third party is the
Internet itself. While the Internet is impartial to both ad-
versary and user, it introduces additive noise as a result
of queuing delays and circuitous routes. These properties
introduce some inherent inaccuracy and unpredictability
into the results of measurements on which geolocation
algorithms rely.
In general, an adversary’s malicious
tampering with network properties (such as adding de-
lay), if done in small amounts, is difﬁcult to distinguish
from additive noise introduced by the Internet.
This work addresses two types of adversaries with dif-
fering capabilities. We assume in both cases that the ad-
versary is fully aware of the geolocation algorithm and
knows both the IP addresses and locations of all land-
marks used in the algorithm. The ﬁrst, simple adver-
sary can tamper only with the RTT measurements taken
by the landmarks. This can be done by selectively de-
laying packets from landmarks to make the RTT appear
larger than it actually is. The simple adversary was cho-
sen to resemble a home user running a program to selec-
tively delay responses to measurements. The second, so-
phisticated adversary, controls several IP addresses and
can use them to create fake routers and paths to the tar-
get. Further, this adversary may have a wide area net-
work (WAN) with several gateway routers and can inﬂu-
ence BGP routes to the target. The sophisticated adver-
sary was chosen to model a cloud provider as the adver-
sary. Many large online service providers already deploy
WANs [11], making this attack model feasible with low
additional cost to the provider.
We make two assumptions in this work. First, while
aware of the geolocation algorithm being used, and the
location and IP addresses of all landmarks, the adver-
sary cannot compromise the landmarks or run code on
them. Thus, the only way the adversary can compromise
the integrity of network measurements is to modify the
properties of trafﬁc traveling on network links directly
connected to a machine under its control.
The second assumption is that network measurements
made by landmarks actually reach the target. Otherwise,
an adversary could trivially attack the geolocation system
by placing a proxy at the forged location that responds to
all geolocation trafﬁc and forwards all other trafﬁc to the
true location. To avoid this attack, the user can either
combine the measurements with regular trafﬁc or protect
it using cryptography. For example, if the geolocation
user is a Web content provider, Muir and Oorschot [18]
have shown that even an anonymization network such as
Tor [28] may be defeated using a Java applet embedded
in a Web page. Users who want to geolocate a VM in a
compute cloud may require the cloud provider to support
tamper-proof VMs [10, 25] and embed a secret key in
the VM for authenticating end-to-end network measure-
ments. In this case, the adversary would need to place a
copy of the VM in the forged location to respond to mea-
surements. Given that the adversary is trying to avoid
placing a VM in the forged location, it is not a practical
attack for a malicious cloud provider.
4 Delay-based geolocation
Delay-based geolocation algorithms use measurements
of end-to-end network delays to geolocate the target IP.
To execute delay-based geolocation, the landmarks need
to calibrate the relationship between geographic distance
and network delay. This is done by having each land-
mark, Li, ping all other landmarks. Since the landmarks
have known geographic locations, Li can then derive a
function mapping geographic distance, gij , to network
delay, dij , observed to each other landmark Lj where
i 6= j [12]. Each landmark performs this calibration and
develops its own mapping of geographic distance to net-
work delay. After calibrating its distance-to-delay func-
tion, it then pings the target IP. Using the distance-to-
delay function, the landmark can then transform the ob-
served delay to the target into a predicted distance to the
target. All landmarks perform this computation to trian-
gulate the location of the target.
Delay-based geolocation operates under the implicit
assumption that network delay is well correlated with ge-
ographic distance. However, network delay is composed
of queuing, processing, transmission and propagation de-
lay [15]. Where only the propagation time of network
trafﬁc is related to distance traveled, and the other com-
ponents vary depending on network load, thus adding
noise to the measured delay. This assumption is also vio-
lated when network trafﬁc does not take a direct (“as the
crow ﬂies”) path between hosts. These indirect paths are
referred to as “circuitous” routes [30].
There are many proposed methods for delay-based ge-
olocation, including GeoPing [19], Statistical Geoloca-
