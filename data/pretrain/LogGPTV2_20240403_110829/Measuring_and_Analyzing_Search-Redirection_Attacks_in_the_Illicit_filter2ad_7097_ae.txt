Conversion ≈ 0.75 × 855 000
20 000 000
= 3.2% .
To ensure that the estimate is a lower bound for the
true conversion rate, whenever there is uncertainty over
the correct ﬁgures, we select smaller estimates for fac-
tors in the numerator and larger estimates for factors in
the denominator. For example, it is possible that the esti-
mate of visits to payment sites is too small, since pharma-
cies could use more than the 21 websites we identiﬁed to
process payments. A more accurate estimate here would
strictly increase the conversion rate. Similarly, 20 mil-
lion visits to search-redirection websites may be an over-
estimate, if, for instance, more popular search queries
suffer from fewer search-redirection attacks. Reducing
this estimate would increase the conversion rate since the
ﬁgure is in the denominator.
There is likely one slight overestimate present in the
numerator. It is not certain that every single visitor to a
payment processing site eventually concluded the trans-
action. However, because these sites are only used to
process payments, we can legitimately assume that most
visitors ended up purchasing products. Even with a con-
servative assumption that only 1 in 10 visitors to the pay-
ment processing site actually complete a transaction, the
lower bound on the conversion rates we would obtain (in
the order of 0.3%) far exceeds the conversion rates ob-
served for email spam [22] or social-network spam [17].
While email spam has attracted more attention, our
research suggests that more illicit pharmacy purchases
are facilitated by search-redirection attacks than by email
spam. One study estimated that the entire Storm bot-
net (which accounted for between 20-30% of email
spam at its peak [12, 37]) attracted around 2 100 sales
per month [22]. The payment processing websites tied
to search-redirection attacks collectively process many
hundreds of thousands of monthly sales. Even allowing
for the possibility that these websites may also process
payments for pharmacies advertised through email spam,
the bulk of sales are likely dominated by referrals from
web search. This is not surprising, given that most peo-
ple ﬁnd it more natural to turn to their search engine of
choice than to their spam folder when shopping online.
To those who aim to reduce unauthorized pharmaceutical
sales, the implication is clear: more emphasis on combat-
ing transactions facilitated by web search is warranted.
6 Mitigation strategies
The measurements we gathered lead us to consider three
complementary mitigation strategies to reduce the im-
pact of search-redirection attacks. One can target the in-
fected sources, advocate search-engine intervention, or
try to disrupt the afﬁliate networks.
Remediation at the sources. The existing public-private
partnership initiated by the White House [19] has so
far focused on areas other than search-redirection at-
tacks. Domain name registrars (led by GoDaddy) can
shut down maliciously registered domains, while Google
has focused on blocking advertisements (but not neces-
sarily search results) from unauthorized pharmacies. Un-
fortunately, no single entity speaks for the many web-
masters whose sites have unknowingly been recruited to
drive trafﬁc to illicit pharmacies.
Nonetheless, eradicating source infections at key web-
sites could be effective. As shown in Figure 3, a small
number of source infections repeatedly appear towards
the top of the search results. Remediating only the most
frequently-occurring websites could substantially reduce
sales. Furthermore, attackers would likely struggle to
adapt to the heightened enforcement. Placing websites
at high-ranking search positions through search-engine
optimization is a slow process, given that the search en-
gine controls the rankings-update cycle. Second, high-
ranking websites that can permeate the top levels of
search results are fairly scarce resources, so that any co-
ordinated reduction is likely to be painful for pharmacies.
How might an enforcement agent select which web-
sites to target for remediation? Again, our ﬁndings are
informative. The survival analysis in Section 4.2 indi-
cates that websites with high PageRank or .edu TLDs
are more persistent. A simple heuristic, then, would be
for an agent to run a few search queries for drug terms
and try to clean up any .edu or high-ranking website
that appears in multiple results.
Search-engine intervention.
In the absence of direct
law enforcement involvement in remediating source in-
fections, search engines could play a more active role in
detecting search-redirection attacks and blocking them
from search results. Google already blocks websites that
are known to be distributing malware [40], and recently
began including warnings on websites believed to be
compromised. From anecdotal inspection, several source
websites participating in search-redirection attacks now
carry the warning. Users are still free to visit the compro-
mised website, however, so those seeking to buy drugs
without a prescription may still ﬁnd willing sellers. We
encourage search engines to consider dropping such re-
sults altogether, given the illegal activity that is being di-
rectly facilitated.

Disrupting the redirection network. The high degree
of interconnection of the different sites we observed in
Section 4 suggests that monetary proﬁts come from fun-
neling trafﬁc between different afﬁliates. One can thus
conjecture that disrupting the connectivity of the net-
work we observed would have adverse economic conse-
quences for the miscreants. Can this be easily achieved?
As described in Section 4, while the network of phar-
macies, sources, and redirectors is almost completely in-
terconnected, there is a comparatively small number of
nodes in the network that redirect trafﬁc from one host
to the next and play a central role in the drug trade.
Speciﬁcally, taking down any of 103 redirectors would
break up the large network of afﬁliates we observed, and
could have strong disruptive effects on the proﬁts made
by advertisers. Of course, we would expect attackers
to quickly move redirectors to different hosts after take-
downs — and in fact, have, over the long measurement
interval we consider, evidence that this sometimes hap-
pens. Nevertheless, the currently long lifetime of redirec-
tors indicates that defenders could act more forcefully.
Perhaps even more interestingly, we were able to ﬁnd
BGP Autonomous System (AS) information for 84 of
the 127 redirectors with in- and out-degrees greater than
two;5 of these, 53 (or 63%) belong to one of only 11 dis-
tinct ASes.6 In other words, a very limited number of
infrastructure providers appear to play an important role
in the illicit online drug trade. Likewise, we were able
to identify domain name registrars for 73 of the redirec-
tor domains; 49 of these domains belong to one of only
5 registrars (ENOM and GoDaddy, which is expected
given their market share, but also “A to Z Domains Solu-
tions,” “BizCN,” and “Directi Internet Solutions,” which
are far more represented in this sample than their market
share would warrant).
Determining whether these hosting providers and reg-
istrars are willing participants or simply have lax host-
ing practices is beyond the scope of our investigation.
However, by strengthening their controls, these service
providers could probably make it harder to operate redi-
rectors, thereby yielding tangible beneﬁts in combating
illicit online drug trade. Should these registrars and
hosting providers take action, we would certainly expect
the miscreants to adapt, and move to different providers
(e.g., bulletproof hosting); but, it is likely that these al-
ternative solutions would be more ﬁnancially costly than
what is currently used, which in turn would reduce the
proﬁt margins miscreants enjoy. In the end, making il-
licit online commerce an unattractive economic proposi-

experiment in February 2011.

cussed in Section 4 is quite accurate.
tion could be the strongest deterrent to such activities.
In sum, any subset of source-infection remediation,
search-engine ﬁltering, and redirector take-down would
make it more difﬁcult for miscreants to conduct their
business. Combining these mitigations would likely
cause signiﬁcant hardship to the criminal networks in
play and would help thwart the illicit online trade of phar-
maceutical drugs (and of other counterfeit goods).
7 Related work
The shift observed in the past decade, from Internet and
computer security attacks motivated by fame and reputa-
tion to attacks motivated by ﬁnancial gain [30], has led
to a number of measurement studies that quantify vari-
ous aspects of the problem, and to motivate possible in-
tervention policies by quantitative analysis. Due to the
amount of network measurement literature available, we
focus here on work most closely related to this paper.
Many studies, e.g., [7, 22, 24, 50], have focused on
email spam, describing the magnitude of the problem in
terms of network resources being consumed, as well as
some of its salient characteristics. Two key take-away
points are that spam is a game of very large numbers,
and that it is not a very effective technique to adver-
tise products, as observed conversion rates (fraction of
email spam that eventually result in a sale) are small.
As pointed out earlier, spamming techniques are how-
ever evolving and increase their effectiveness by better
targeting potential customers, as described by the recent
ﬂurry of spam observed in social networks [17].
A very recent paper by Levchenko et al. [24] provides
a thorough investigation of the different actors partici-
pating spamming campaigns, from the spammers them-
selves, to the suppliers of illicit goods (luxury items, soft-
ware, pharmaceutical drugs, ...). The key difference with
the present study is that Levchenko et al. are focusing
on businesses advertising by spam, while we are looking
into search-engine manipulation. The data we gathered
(see Section 4.4) seems to suggest that, so far, the two
sets of miscreants remain relatively disjoint, but that ad-
vertising based on search engine manipulation is on the
rise (see Section 3.3).
Measurement studies of spam have also informed pos-
sible intervention policies, by identifying some infras-
tructure weaknesses. For instance, taking down a few
servers from suspicious Internet Service Providers [9]
can signiﬁcantly reduce the overall volume of email
spam.
Inﬁltration of spam-generating botnets, as sug-
gested by [39], has also been shown to be effective in
designing much more accurate spam ﬁltering rules.
A series of papers by Moore and Clayton [27, 29, 31]
investigates the economics of phishing, and show inter-
esting insights on the tactics phishers use to evade detec-
tion. A further outcome of this line of research is a set of
12
recommended intervention techniques to combat phish-
ing, e.g., applying economic pressure on DNS registrars.
The present paper borrows some of the techniques (use
of Webalizer data, lifetime computation) used for phish-
ing measurements, as they apply as well to measurement
of online pharmacy activity (see Section 3).
A separate branch of research has focused on eco-
nomic implications of online crime. Thomas and Mar-
tin [45], Franklin et al. [16] and Zhuge et al. [51] pas-
sively monitor the advertised prices of illicit commodi-
ties exchanged in varied online environments (IRC chan-
nels and web forums). They estimate the size of the mar-
kets associated with the exchange of credit card num-
bers, identity information, email address databases, and
forged video game credentials. Christin et al. [8] mine
online forum data to assess the economic impact of a so-
cial engineering attack pervasive on Japanese-language
websites, and to identify some of the key characteristics
of the network of perpetrators behind these scams.
More closely related to the attack described here,
Ntoulas et al. [34] measure search engine manipulation
attacks, and Wang et al. [47] show the connection be-
tween web and email spam, and online advertisers.
The medical literature has been preoccupied with il-
licit online pharmacies for a few years, but has mostly
looked at smaller data samples, and has solely focused
on the retail side rather than the entire infrastructure sup-
porting this commerce. As examples, Henney et al. in-
vestigated the credentials of 37 online pharmacies [18].
Littlejohn et al. [25] focused on a slightly larger sample
of 275 websites, to primarily inform the socio-economic
impact of Internet availability on drug abuse. Likewise,
we are not the ﬁrst to evidence the existence of adver-
tising afﬁliate networks, which have been previously de-
scribed informally (see, e.g., [44]).
We believe that the work presented in this paper is the
ﬁrst to provide a detailed analysis of search-redirection
attacks, and to substantiate their use with a quantitative
analysis of the overall magnitude of the illicit online pre-
scription drug trade. Further, we obtain both an under-
standing of the structure of the miscreants’ networks, and
an idea of the conversion rates they can expect. In that
respect, our measurements may be a useful starting point
for a more thorough quantitative economic analysis.
8 Conclusions and future work
Given the enormous value of web search, it is no sur-
prise that miscreants have taken aim at manipulating its
results. We have presented evidence of systematic com-
promise of high-ranking websites that have been repro-
grammed to dynamically redirect to online pharmacies.
These search-redirection attacks are present in one third
of the search results we collected. The infections per-
sist for months, 96% of the infected hosts are connected
through redirections, and a few collections of redirec-
tors are critical to the connection between source infec-
tions and pharmacies. We have also observed that legit-
imate businesses are nearly absent from the search re-
sults, having been completely drawn out of the search
results by blog and forum spam and compromised web-
sites. We also offer a conservative estimate of between
0.3% and 3% conversion rate of searches for drugs turn-
ing into sales, which should motivate the pressing need
for countermeasures. Fortunately, we are optimistic that
the criminals behind search-redirection attacks could be
disrupted with targeted interventions due to the high con-
