PowerRun is fantastic, and I have missed it every time I switch from Mac to
PC.
I can search programs on my computer, and I can do simple calculations such as
9*3 and 5+2 and similar.
Would is be possible to add web search and currency calculations?
Entering for instance "10DKK" should result in conversions to 5 top currencies
and the one from you locale settings in Windows.
Web search should be either default Google, or for instance "g " to search
Google, "b " to search Bing, "w " to search WiKipedia, "d " to search DuckDuck
and "y " to search Youtube
