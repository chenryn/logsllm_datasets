number of coeﬃcients to estimate), assigning high values to
high-frequency coeﬃcients leads to poor signal reconstruc-
tion. We make use of the knowledge that the signal to be
estimated has a mainly low frequency spectrum as follows:
we penalize in (1) the coeﬃcients associated to deeper scales
of the diﬀusion wavelet basis by them assigning weights ωi,
such that (1) becomes:
(cid:6)β(cid:6)1 subject to ys = ABΩβ,
(5)
bβ = arg min
β
where Ω is the diagonal matrix such that Ωi,i = ωi. Recall
each βi is a coeﬃcient in the diﬀusion wavelet basis. Follow-
ing the discussion above, the weights should increase with
the depth of the scale associated to βi. Here, we chose a
geometric increase in the weights: denoting by k the scale
associated to a diﬀusion wavelet coeﬃcient βi, then ωi = αk
where α is a parameter that is ﬁxed to 2 in the remainder
of this section.
We show how our estimation techniques performs in Fig-
ure 4, which plots performance as the number of paths-per-
timestep varies from 1 to 30, with the blocksize set to τ = 1
and τ = 8 timesteps. For the τ = 8 case, end-to-end de-
lays are estimated by blocks. Our dataset includes mea-
surements for all paths in the network, so we can verify the
accuracy of our estimation procedure against ground truth.
We assess performance in terms of the relative end-to-end
mean delay error, |(cid:12)y − yest(cid:13)|/(cid:12)y(cid:13), and the relative (cid:2)2 error,
||y − yest||2/||y||2, where ||y||2 =
i . Performance is
averaged over 400 timesteps.

First consider the single timestep case, τ = 1 in Fig. 4. We
verify that the rank of G is equal to the number of links nl
and thus the observation of nl paths ensures exact recovery
of all end-to-end link delays with any estimation technique
we are presenting. Our technique outperforms linear estima-
tion (network kriging), with the performance improvement
being most substantial when there are few measurements
per timestep.
However, to fully harness the power of the nonlinear esti-
mator, we need to consider data (and its diﬀusion, via the
diﬀusion operator) over several timesteps. Now consider the
block estimation case, τ = 8, in Fig. 4; when less than 10
samples per timestep are collected, nonlinear estimation in
a wavelet basis exhibits much lower estimation error than
the linear estimator in terms of average end-to-end delay; (cid:2)2
error is also lowered when nonlinear estimation in a wavelet
basis is used.
In terms of mean end-to-end delay (Fig. 4, bottom panel),
our results suggest that by making only 3 measurements per
timestep we can hope to recover the mean network end-to-
end delay with an error of less than 10%. The error stabilizes
for larger number of samples per timestep and decreases to
0 as the number of samples per timestep approaches 21.
In the last ﬁgure (see Fig. 5), we provide a more detailed
insight into the nature of our end-to-end delay recovery tech-

data, estimation via nonlinear estimation in the wavelet ba-
sis and path selection accounting for time-correlation, and
linear estimation) over time for 2 diﬀerent paths. We used
τ = 8 and 10 samples per timestep in the estimation proce-
dure. In Fig 5 (bottom panel), for example, we see that lin-
ear estimation severely underestimates the end-to-end delay
for the chosen path.
In general, the linear estimation ex-
hibits substantial bias. In contrast, the nonlinear estimator
exhibits much less bias but more variability. It is possible
to estimate the bias if we are provided measurements of all
link-level queueing delays (or can make suﬃcient estimates
to form unbiased estimates.) However, such observations are
not always available and we focus here on the case where es-
timating the bias is not possible. In the following section,
we study an application to our technique where physical
constraints on the observations prohibit the utilization of
full-ranked observations to precompute the bias
The presented nonlinear estimation technique is outper-
forms the standard linear estimation technique. In terms of
computation time, on standard hardware, most of the time is
spent computing the basis B (seconds to minutes depending
on τ for the Abilene topology). This is a one-time cost since
B only depends on the network topology. The nonlinear
estimation part is typically an order of magnitude slower
than linear estimation, however it only takes tens to hun-
dreds of milliseconds, depending on τ , to estimate a block
of end-to-end delays for all paths (110τ end-to-end delays),
making the technique deployable for real-time monitoring in
networks with tens of nodes.
6. ALL-OPTICAL NETWORK
MONITORING
Figure 5: Comparison between nonlinear estimation
and linear estimation of path delays for two example
paths.
We address the problem of monitoring circuit-switched all-
optical networks with no wavelength conversion subject to a
variety of physical impairments. More speciﬁcally, we tackle
the speciﬁc case where signal statistics (which are used to
determine signals’ bit-error rates) can only be measured at
certain locations. This is a key issue in all-optical networks
since the equipment needed to take measurements at one
location is extremely costly. The problem is then two-fold:
given ﬁxed BER monitors and hence the BER of observed
lightpaths, what is the best estimate of the BERs of un-
observed lightpaths? Then, how should BER monitors be
placed to facilitate the estimation problem?
All-optical networks are high-speed, optical networks
where OEO (optical-electrical-optical) conversion, which
takes place at the nodes in traditional optical networks
(e.g., SONET networks), is removed [21]. In all-optical net-
works, signal are transmitted in the optical domain with
no electrical regeneration from end to end.
In the nodes,
which are called optical cross-connects (OXCs), signals are
switched spatially in the optical domain [10]. The absence
of OEO conversion allows (among other beneﬁts) all-optical
networks to bypass the capacity bottleneck incurred by the
relatively low speed of electronic components, as data pro-
cessing at 40 Gbit/s and above requires expensive devices.
However, removing OEO conversion results in two main
practical issues for all-optical network operation and man-
agement.
First, signals are propagated over very long distances with-
out electrical regeneration and physical impairments accu-
mulate as signals propagate in optical ﬁber and OXCs. Re-
cently, network-layer techniques, namely, Routing and Wave-
length Assignment (RWA) techniques, have been harnessed
to counter these physical impairments. Assuming circuit-
switched networks with no wavelength conversion1, a RWA
In this section, we apply the compressive network moni-
toring framework derived in this paper to the particular case
of bit-error rate (BER) monitoring in all-optical networks.

version devices are currently at the experimental stage and
are not ready for industrialization.

Figure 6: Model for a lightpath in an all-optical network, and sources of physical impairment. The signal
traverses nodes (OXCs), spans of optical ﬁber and optical ampliﬁers before reaching destination, where it is
detected by a photodetector — represented here by a square law device. Each device degrades the SNR of
the signal: nodes inject node crosstalk, ﬁber spans injects nonlinear crosstalk, and ampliﬁers inject ampliﬁer
(ASE) noise. The BER associated to the signal can be computed from the distributions of the received “0”
and “1” samples, and is related to the appearance of the eye diagram of the signal.
algorithm chooses a route and a wavelength (the combina-
tion of which is called “lightpath” [4]) to accommodate each
incoming call at call admission time.
It is possible to in-
crease the quality of transmission in optical networks by
using appropriate RWA techniques [15, 16]. In this paper,
we make no assumption regarding the particular RWA used
in the network.
The second major issue in all-optical networks is the ab-
sence of OEO converters, which makes monitoring diﬃcult.
Indeed, in traditional, non all-optical networks, signals are
detected at each node, allowing error detection and correc-
tion. For example, SONET frames carry parity bits to detect
errors [17]. Monitoring in all-optical networks is therefore
restricted, both in terms of what can be measured and where
it can be measured. Since electrical signals are not available
at intermediate nodes of a lightpath, only a few optical quan-
tities such as the optical power of the signal are measurable,
and obtaining such intermediate measurements requires ex-
pensive optical spectrometers. Error detection can only be
performed at the edge of the network, since that is the only
place where electrical conversion is performed.
6.1 All-Optical Network Model
We consider circuit-switched all-optical networks where
data is carried over lightpaths, that is, the combination of a
