Question: "An iOS app developer aims to increase the security of their application against reverse engineering. Which of the following measures can enhance the app's resilience to tampering and reverse engineering, and what is a limitation that the developer should consider?"
 "A": "Implementing file-based checks for jailbreak detection improves app security by providing an absolute method to detect all jailbroken devices."
 "B": "Scattering jailbreak detection checks throughout the app's source code can improve the overall anti-tampering scheme, although they cannot guarantee 100% effectiveness."
 "C": "Using protocol handler checks like 'cydia://' to detect jailbroken devices is an outdated method and should not be considered for modern iOS security."
 "D": "Adding automated jailbreak detection bypass techniques to the app can thwart reverse engineers and make the app completely secure against debugging."
Answer: B
