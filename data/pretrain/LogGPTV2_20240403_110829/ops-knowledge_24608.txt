Question: Consider a modified WPA2-PSK handshake process where the following changes are proposed for a new wireless network security protocol:

1. The ANonce and SNonce values are exchanged but are not used in the derivation of the PTK.
2. The GTK is no longer encrypted before being sent to the client.
3. The MICs are replaced with simple checksums for faster processing.

Evaluate the potential implications of these changes. Select all that apply.
"A": "The unique encryption key for each client would not be ensured, making the network more vulnerable to eavesdropping.",
"B": "Encryption of the GTK is unnecessary as it is the same for all clients, thus not encrypting it does not introduce additional risk.",
"C": "Replacing MICs with checksums compromises the integrity check of the nonces, potentially allowing for tampering and replay attacks.",
"D": "The omission of nonces in the derivation of the PTK could lead to predictable keys, increasing susceptibility to certain attacks."
Answer: ACD
