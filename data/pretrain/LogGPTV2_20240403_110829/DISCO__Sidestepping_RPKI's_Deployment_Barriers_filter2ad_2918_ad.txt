### VII. Evaluation

We evaluate DISCO in two primary aspects: its compatibility with the current Internet infrastructure (§VII-A) and its security against various types of attacks (§VII-B). The code for our simulations and measurement analysis is available online [30].

#### A. Compatibility with Today’s Internet

DISCO's strategy for distributing public keys through optional transitive attributes is designed to be compatible with today’s Internet. Routers do not need to understand these optional attributes but are expected to forward them to other networks, thereby extending BGP [48]. However, BGP implementations might violate the protocol specification and filter unknown optional transitive attributes, as observed during the standardization of BGP large communities [55]. We evaluate the propagation of DISCO’s new public key BGP attribute and provide evidence that it would reliably propagate across the global Internet.

**1. Experiment Setup**

We conducted two experiments to measure the propagation of BGP announcements carrying DISCO’s attribute using the PEERING platform [52], [53]. To ensure community support and safety, we shared our experiment proposal with several operators and integrated their feedback into the design. The proposal was then approved by the PEERING operations team. 

PEERING did not initially support the use of such attributes, so we extended the platform to enable per-experiment capabilities. This allowed our approved experiment to use an optional transitive BGP attribute while maintaining the principle of least privilege for other experiments. We announced a “DISCO” prefix with an optional transitive attribute containing a 32-byte owner’s public key, using attribute 0xFF, which is reserved for experimental use. We also announced a “control” prefix without any unknown attributes to track the routes ASes use to reach PEERING under normal conditions.

The first experiment announced the prefixes from PEERING’s point of presence at UFMG, Brazil, and the second from the University of Washington (UW), USA. Each announcement lasted 15 minutes.

DISCO’s BGP announcements conform to the specification but are unusual compared to typical BGP announcements. We took precautions to minimize potential adverse effects on the global routing system if a BGP implementation does not comply with the BGP RFCs or contains a bug triggered by our announcements. We disseminated the experiment plan on the NANOG operator mailing lists, providing advance notice of the schedule. Operators had ample time between experiments to identify and report any issues. Additionally, we tested successful propagation in controlled environments using Cisco IOS-based routers, Quagga, and BIRD.

**2. Measuring DISCO’s Effect on Reachability**

We evaluated whether the presence of the attribute on the DISCO prefix announcement affects the reachability of Internet destinations. If many routers filtered announcements with unusual attributes, destinations behind them would lack a route to the prefix. During our experiments, we used zmap [17] to send ICMP Echo Requests to a list of 5,651,501 IP addresses, targeting those with the highest response rate in responsive /24 prefixes from ISI’s Internet census data from November 2018 [18].

Table III shows that the DISCO and control prefixes have equivalent global reachability. The average AS-level response rate during the UFMG and UW experiments was around 47% and 66%, respectively. The low response rate is due to the scattering of probes across a large set of targets, some of which may have gone offline, become unreachable, or stopped responding since the census. The increase in response rate from the UFMG to the UW experiment is attributed to zmap overloading our VMs during the UFMG experiment and dropping response packets; this was corrected for the UW experiment.

Despite the low overall response rate, it is similar for both the DISCO and control prefixes. The number of ASes that responded only to the DISCO prefix is roughly equal to the number that responded only to the control prefix (see the exclusive ASes columns). Two factors outside attribute propagation can cause responsiveness to one prefix but not another: zmap probing in a random order, which can combine with delayed route convergence, and variations in individual destination responsiveness due to ICMP rate limiting and packet loss. Additionally, a temporary disconnection of the BGP session used to announce the DISCO prefix during the UW experiment may have negatively impacted the propagation of announcements and data plane reachability.

Figure 4 further supports the conclusion that the DISCO and control prefixes are similarly reachable. The “all ASes” line shows the distribution of the number of targets probed in all ASes with responsive destinations. Most ASes own only a small number of /24 prefixes, while some own tens or hundreds. The figure compares this line with the distributions of the number of targets probed in ASes where we observe responses on only one of the prefixes. These distributions are heavily skewed to the left, indicating that differences in AS sets are more likely in ASes with a low number of targets, leading to higher measurement errors.

**3. Identifying Filtering on the Control Plane**

To check the propagation and attributes of routes used to reach the control and DISCO prefixes, we downloaded BGP updates from routers around the world collected by the RouteViews and RIPE RIS projects. We compared routes toward the control and DISCO prefixes to identify candidate ASes that could be filtering the announcement of the DISCO prefix (denoted F) or discarding DISCO’s attribute and forwarding the announcement without it (denoted D). We applied the following rules to estimate F and D for each experiment:

1. For each router R that exports a route toward the control prefix to a BGP collector, we add all ASes in R’s route to A. These represent the set of ASes we expect to see in routes to the DISCO prefix. We initialize F to this full set A, and subsequent rules remove ASes we do see in routes to the DISCO prefix, leaving candidates that may be filtering.
2. For each router R that exports a route toward the DISCO prefix without the DISCO attribute to a BGP collector, we add all ASes in R’s route to D. We do not remove ASes from F as we cannot determine if ASes after the one discarding the attribute would have filtered the announcement.
3. For each router R that exports a route toward the DISCO prefix with the DISCO attribute, we remove all ASes in R’s route from D and F.

To avoid considering transient routes, we required that a route remains stable for 5 minutes during the experiment. If a router exports two routes that satisfy this condition, we consider both routes. For ASes in the converged routes to the control prefix, we check if they appear in any route to the DISCO prefix. If an AS appears on a route to the DISCO prefix, it indicates that the AS does not filter the prefix. If an AS appears on a route to the DISCO prefix with the DISCO attribute, it indicates that the AS does not discard the attribute.

Table IV summarizes our results, showing |F| and |D|, and the number of routers exporting paths to the DISCO and control prefixes. The results indicate that the majority of ASes receive DISCO’s prefix with its attribute. If we observe an AS in a route with the attribute in one experiment, it suggests that the AS does not filter on the attribute, even if not observed in the other experiment.

One AS exported routes toward the DISCO prefix without DISCO’s attribute, traversing two ASes (AS16150 and AS48285) that are candidates for having discarded the attribute. Since other routes do not traverse these ASes, we cannot determine which one is responsible for discarding the DISCO attribute.
