It seems you are experiencing issues with Python 3.5 and 3.6 on your Windows 7 system, while Python 2.7 is working fine. To resolve this, try the following steps:

1. Locate the installation executable (`.exe`) file for the Python version you wish to install.
2. Right-click on the `.exe` file.
3. Select "Run as administrator" from the context menu.

This approach has worked for me in similar situations. If the problem persists, please provide more details about the specific error messages or issues you are encountering.
