User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 heavy_scan_operator 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function diagnoses whether there is a heavy scan operator in the query related table. If the table has too many fetched tuples and the hit rate is low, it is considered a root cause. Additionally, if there are expensive sequential scans, index scans, or heap scans, it is also considered a root cause. The function provides details on the heavy scan operator, including the number of fetched tuples, returned rows, and hit rate. It also suggests adjustments to avoid large scans. If there are expensive scans, the function suggests confirming whether the inner table has an index, avoiding count operations, and considering the index filter ability. If there is a heavy scan operator, the function provides details on the operator and suggests adjustments according to business needs. If there are no suggestions, it suggests avoiding heavy scans.
