T run each one instance of their role, as speciﬁed by the protocol,
where T can deal with up to three requests. The judge, who is
assumed to be honest, blames T if and only if he obtains a message
of the form (cid:104)aT ,rT(cid:105) for some contract. For PASW , we deﬁne α to be
the set of runs where J obtains a message of the form (cid:104)aT ,rT(cid:105) for
some contract, modeling that J is faced with both aT and rT . Let Φ
consist of the accountability constraint α ⇒ dis(T ). We obtain the
following theorem:
THEOREM 4. J ensures Φ-accountability for PASW .
Following Remark 1, we veriﬁed Theorem 4 automatically using
the protocol analysis tool by Millen and Shmatikov [36] (see [33]
for our formal modeling). As mentioned, the completeness condi-
tion is rather trivial in this case.

APPENDIX
A. THE BINGO VOTING SYSTEM
A.1 Zero-knowledge Proofs for Bingo Voting
Here we describe the zero-knowledge proofs used in the tallying
phase and the initialization phase of the Bingo Voting system in
more detail.
ZK-proofs in the tallying phase.
The following steps are per-
formed for every receipt: First, the voting machine generates a
new commitment on the pair ( j,r), where j is the chosen candi-
date and r is the number generated by the RNG and printed next
to j. Then, all the commitments for the receipt are published in a
random order: one of them is the commitment just described, the
other (l − 1) commitments are unopened commitments published
on the bulletin board in the initialization phase, where for different
receipts, different commitments are taken from the bulletin board.
An observer can verify that this is the case. Next, these commit-
ments are re-randomized and shufﬂed twice; both the intermediate
and the ﬁnal set of commitments are published. The ﬁnal commit-
ments are opened. Now an observer can check that there is exactly
one commitment for each candidate and that all numbers shown on
the receipt were in fact contained in the ﬁnal commitments. Fi-
nally, the auditors choose a random bit in some distributed way,
see, e.g., [15]. Depending on the value of this bit, the voting ma-
chine publishes the random factors for the ﬁrst or for the second
re-randomization step.
2 )s by repeating the procedure s times.
If the voting machine would try to cheat, this would be detected
with a probability of at least 50%; this probability can be increased
to 1− ( 1
ZK-proofs in the initialization phase. This proof was not precisely
deﬁned in [10], but it can be implemented by randomized par-
tial checking similarly to the zero-knowledge proof in the tallying
phase. To this end, we assume that a commitment comm( j,x j
i ) on
a pair ( j,x j
i ) = (comm( j), comm(x j
i )),
where the commitments on the single components are Pedersen
commitments. Now, to show that among the published commit-
ments there are exactly n of the form comm( j,x j
i ) for every candi-
date j, the zero-knowledge proof proceeds similarly as in the tal-
lying phase, except that it only uses the ﬁrst component C j
i of a
commitment.
