In our current project I wanted to use Introductions. We already use the
aop:config block(s) quite extensivly. We decided to use this block also for
the .
However this alows only for 3 parameters to be specified  
types-matching="[aspectj expression]"  
implement-interface="[interface to introduce]"  
default-impl="[Class of the default implementation]"
However in our default implementation (default-impl) we need to have some
beans injected. For now we created a patchy solution with a singleton which
holds a reference to the applicationContext. At construction time/initializing
time we use this to retrieve the desired beans.
However what I would like to do is to wire up this delegate from my spring
configuration and use that in our aop:declare-parents/ tag.
Something like this.
