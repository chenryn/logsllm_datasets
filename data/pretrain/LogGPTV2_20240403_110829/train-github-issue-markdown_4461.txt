In our current project, we are using the `aop:config` block extensively. We decided to use this block for introductions as well. However, the `aop:declare-parents` tag only allows us to specify three parameters:
- `types-matching="[aspectj expression]"`
- `implement-interface="[interface to introduce]"`
- `default-impl="[Class of the default implementation]"`

Our issue is that in the `default-impl` (the default implementation class), we need to inject some beans. As a temporary solution, we created a singleton that holds a reference to the `applicationContext`. During construction or initialization, we use this to retrieve the necessary beans.

However, what I would like to do is wire up this delegate directly from the Spring configuration and then use it within the `aop:declare-parents` tag. Ideally, something like this:

```xml
<aop:config>
    <aop:advisor advice-ref="myAdvice" pointcut="execution(* com.example.MyClass.*(..))"/>
</aop:config>

<bean id="myAdvice" class="com.example.MyDefaultImpl">
    <!-- Bean dependencies can be injected here -->
    <property name="dependency1" ref="someBean"/>
    <property name="dependency2" ref="anotherBean"/>
</bean>
```
