When using a fresh installation of the latest Julia master on an Ubuntu 14.04 system, and with an existing `~/.julia/v0.5` setup, attempting to clone an unregistered package via `Pkg.clone` results in an error. For example, when running:

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JaredCrean2/PETSc.jl.git")
```

The following output is observed:

```
INFO: Cloning PETSc from https://github.com/JaredCrean2/PETSc.jl.git
ERROR: unlink: no such file or directory (ENOENT)
 in cd at pkg/dir.jl:37
 in clone at pkg.jl:38
```

This indicates that the cloning process encounters an issue related to a missing file or directory.
