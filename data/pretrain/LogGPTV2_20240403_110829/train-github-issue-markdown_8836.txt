Dropdowns try to center their chosen value when the popup opens up. If the
dropdown is placed on top of the screen (or the list of values is long
enough), that's not possible. So you get a scrolling animation while the popup
settles.
This is jarring at best and annoying at worst since it delays user action
(can't tap on any value until the animation ends [typically a second]).
It would be great if Flutter can precompute whether the centering is possible
and if not prevent the scrolling.
