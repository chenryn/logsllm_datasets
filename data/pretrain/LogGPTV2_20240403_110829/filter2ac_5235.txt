title:botconf2019 The Bagsu Banker Case
The carding ecosystem is constantly evolving. The actors have to adapt their methodology to continue to steal from the banks with a good cost effectiveness ratio. To maintain this balance, the carders have moved towards infrastructure as a service, making the analystâ€™s work more and more complex. We have discovered the infrastructure of a quiet banking Trojan actor that has been targeting German users since at least 2014. Our presentation aims to give a technical insight into the whole operation: infrastructure, multi platform trojans, money laundering schemes and their recent move towards the malware-as-a-service markets like Dreambot, Trickbot or even Emotet.
