User: The number of servers in the company's data center has increased by 100. How should the network topology be adjusted to ensure high efficiency and security?
Assistant: Specific adjustments need to be made according to the situation, and the following are some possible methods: 1. Expand network bandwidth: Increasing the number of servers means greater network bandwidth is required, so you can consider increasing network bandwidth to ensure network efficiency. 2. Increase the number of switches: increasing the number of switches can add more ports, thereby supporting more server connections and ensuring network performance. 3. Increase firewall and security measures: As the number of servers increases, more security measures are required to protect the security of the data center. 4. Update the network topology: redesign the network topology to adapt to the new number of servers and network bandwidth requirements. 5. Virtualization technology: Virtualization technology can be used to reduce the number of servers, thereby reducing the complexity of network topology and the burden of network bandwidth.
