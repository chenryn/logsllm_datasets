## Expected Behavior
Due to the somewhat slow behaviour when using controlled textfields, I'm
currently trying to use uncontrolled textfields. My first idea was to simply
use `setState` in the onChange event handler to update the state.
Basically, the code looks like this:
The event handler currently looks like this to make sure it's `setState()`
which causes the problem:
    handleAnswer = id => event => {
            this.setState({
                test: event.target.value
            });
        }
What I expect to see is that the state property "test" is set to the value of
the textfield.
## Current Behavior
The event handler gets called once, which sets the state to the key pressed.
However, said character does not appear in the textfield and the field
immediately loses focus afterwards.
What gets me is that the same code works just fine for a RadioButton.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
The non-working code is provided above.
## Context
Currently, controlled textfields are very slow. I'll have to make do with
`ref`s then.
