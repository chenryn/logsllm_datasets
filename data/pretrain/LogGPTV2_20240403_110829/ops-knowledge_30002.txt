User: I'm trying to release my first Python package in the wild and I was successful in setting it up on PyPi and able to do a pip install.  When I try to run the package via the command line ($ python etlTest), I receive the following error:
/usr/bin/python: can't find '__main__' module in 'etlTest'
When I run the code directly from my IDE, it works without issue.  I am using Python 2.7 and have __init__.py scripts where required.  What do I need to do to get this working?
Assistant: I had the same problem and solved it by making sure I'm in the correct directory of the package you are trying to run.
For Windows, type dir in the console, while on Linux/macOS - ls to see your current directory
