When working with `datetime64` objects in a Pandas Series, the method you're attempting to use may not directly support `datetime64` for checking data frequency. To resolve this issue, you need to convert the `datetime64` objects to Python's `datetime` objects before performing the `allclose` check.

For clarity, here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Convert the `datetime64` objects in your Pandas Series to Python `datetime` objects.
2. Use the `allclose` function (or an equivalent method) to check the data frequency.

Here is an example of how you can do this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

# Example Series with datetime64 objects
series = pd.Series([pd.Timestamp('2023-01-01'), pd.Timestamp('2023-01-02')])

# Convert datetime64 to datetime
converted_series = series.apply(lambda x: x.to_pydatetime())

# Now you can perform the allclose check or other operations
# For example, using numpy's allclose
import numpy as np

# Assuming you have a reference series to compare against
reference_series = pd.Series([datetime(2023, 1, 1), datetime(2023, 1, 2)])

# Convert reference series to datetime
reference_converted = reference_series.apply(lambda x: x.to_pydatetime())

# Check if the two series are close
are_close = np.allclose(converted_series, reference_converted)

print(are_close)
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the `allclose` check works correctly with `datetime64` objects.
