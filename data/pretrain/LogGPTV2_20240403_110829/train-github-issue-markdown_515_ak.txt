### Environment and Build Configuration

The following environment variables are set for the build process:

```sh
export USER_LIBRARY_DIR=/Users/app/Library
export USE_DYNAMIC_NO_PIC=YES
export USE_HEADERMAP=YES
export USE_HEADER_SYMLINKS=NO
export VALIDATE_PRODUCT=NO
export VALID_ARCHS="i386 x86_64"
export VERBOSE_PBXCP=NO
export VERBOSE_SCRIPT_LOGGING=YES
export VERSIONING_SYSTEM=apple-generic
export VERSIONPLIST_PATH=Runner.app/version.plist
export VERSION_INFO_BUILDER=app
export VERSION_INFO_FILE=Runner_vers.c
export VERSION_INFO_STRING="\"@(#)PROGRAM:Runner  PROJECT:Runner-1\""
export WRAPPER_EXTENSION=app
export WRAPPER_NAME=Runner.app
export WRAPPER_SUFFIX=.app
export WRAP_ASSET_PACKS_IN_SEPARATE_DIRECTORIES=NO
export XCODE_APP_SUPPORT_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode
export XCODE_PRODUCT_BUILD_VERSION=9C40b
export XCODE_VERSION_ACTUAL=0920
export XCODE_VERSION_MAJOR=0900
export XCODE_VERSION_MINOR=0920
export XPCSERVICES_FOLDER_PATH=Runner.app/XPCServices
export YACC=yacc
export arch=x86_64
export variant=normal
```

### Build Script Execution

The build script is executed with the following command:

```sh
/bin/sh -c /Users/app/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Runner-eibyryruxxukonbktfgxmdtgldrb/Build/Intermediates.noindex/Runner.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/Runner.build/Script-9740EEB61CF901F6004384FC.sh
```

### Directory and File Operations

The following directory and file operations are performed:

```sh
mkdir -p -- /Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Flutter
rm -rf -- /Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Flutter/Flutter.framework
rm -rf -- /Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Flutter/App.framework
cp -r -- /Users/app/documents/flutter/flutter/bin/cache/artifacts/engine/ios/Flutter.framework /Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Flutter
```

However, the `cp` command fails due to too many levels of symbolic links:

```sh
cp: /Users/app/documents/flutter/flutter/bin/cache/artifacts/engine/ios/Flutter.framework/Headers/Flutter.h: Too many levels of symbolic links
cp: /Users/app/documents/flutter/flutter/bin/cache/artifacts/engine/ios/Flutter.framework/Headers/FlutterAppDelegate.h: Too many levels of symbolic links
...
```

### Flutter Build Process

The Flutter build process is initiated with the following command:

```sh
/Users/app/documents/flutter/flutter/bin/flutter --suppress-analytics --verbose build bundle --target-platform=ios --target=/Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/lib/main.dart --snapshot=build/snapshot_blob.bin --debug --depfile=build/snapshot_blob.bin.d --asset-dir=/Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Flutter/flutter_assets --preview-dart-2
```

### Compilation Errors

The compilation process encounters errors due to missing header files:

```sh
In file included from /Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Runner/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.m:5:
/Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Runner/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h:8:9: fatal error: 'Flutter/Flutter.h' file not found
#import <Flutter/Flutter.h>
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```

Similar errors occur for other files:

```sh
In file included from /Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m:1:
/Users/app/Desktop/flutter_apps/hello/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.h:1:9: fatal error: 'Flutter/Flutter.h' file not found
#import <Flutter/Flutter.h>
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### Flutter Doctor Output

The `flutter doctor -v` command provides the following output:

```sh

```

### Summary

The build process failed due to missing `Flutter/Flutter.h` header files, likely caused by an issue with the symbolic links in the `Flutter.framework`. The `flutter doctor` command did not detect any issues, but the Flutter and Dart plugins were not installed in Android Studio.
