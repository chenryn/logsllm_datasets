**Table 1: BGP attacks and their associated properties.**

#### 2.2.1 Traditional Sub-Prefix Hijack
**Attack Methodology:**
The adversary makes a BGP announcement for a sub-prefix that includes the victim domain’s IP. For example, to attack a victim domain on the IP address `X.Y.Z.1` with prefix `X.Y.Z.0/23`, an adversary could announce the prefix `X.Y.Z.0/24` to capture the victim’s traffic. Figure 2a shows the default routing of traffic when no attack is active, and Figure 2b shows the effects of a sub-prefix hijack attack.

**Effect:**
Because routers prefer more-specific IP prefixes over less-specific ones, this announcement will capture all traffic to the victim’s domain, as demonstrated in Figure 2b. This attack is highly effective and can be launched by any AS on the Internet.

**Attack Viability:**
This attack is highly viable. The majority of domains use IP prefixes shorter than the maximum `/24`, which allows an attacker to announce IP sub-prefixes without being filtered (many ASes filter announcements longer than `/24` [9]). Additionally, the attack has a global effect and the adversary’s location does not influence the attack viability.

**Attack Stealthiness:**
Although effective, this attack is very visible in both the control and data planes. As seen in Figure 2b, all traffic from any AS on the Internet is routed to the adversary. In the data plane, this causes a nearly global loss of connectivity to the victim’s domain. From a control-plane viewpoint, the announcement is highly suspicious. The adversary’s AS has likely never announced the victim’s prefix before. When the adversary originates the victim’s prefix (an event known as a Multiple Origin AS, MOAS, conflict [49]), many BGP monitoring systems [30, 42, 29, 26] will flag this announcement due to the suspicious change in origin AS. Furthermore, if the victim has an RPKI entry for their IP prefix, this announcement will be filtered by ASes that perform Route Origin Validation (ROV) [17]. Thus, although an adversary could easily get a certificate before the attack is detected (as we will show in Section 3, several CAs will sign a certificate seconds after domain control verification and these attacks can last for several hours), the rapid detection of this announcement would reduce the damage the bogus certificate could do.

#### 2.2.2 Traditional Equally-Specific Prefix Hijack
**Attack Methodology:**
An adversary aiming to increase stealthiness (or attack a domain running in a `/24` prefix so a sub-prefix attack is not viable) may launch an equally-specific-prefix hijack [22]. In this attack, an adversary announces the exact same prefix that the victim is announcing. Each AS will then pick the preferred route between the adversary’s false announcement and the victim’s original announcement, based on local preferences and path length, etc. As shown in Figure 2c, this type of attack causes only part of the Internet to prefer the adversary’s announcement. In parts of the Internet that do not prefer the adversary’s route, this attack is unnoticeable in the data plane (connectivity is unaffected). Also, in the control plane, many ASes will not learn (let alone choose) the adversary’s route.

**Attack Viability:**
The viability of this attack is determined by the topological relationship between the CA, the victim, and the adversary. The Internet topology must cause the adversary’s route to be preferred by the CA over the victim’s route. Thus, this attack is less viable than a traditional sub-prefix hijack. We will further quantify the viability of this attack in Section 4.3.1.

**Attack Stealthiness:**
In the control plane, this attack is more stealthy than a traditional sub-prefix hijack because parts of the Internet will not hear the adversary’s announcement. However, this attack still involves a change in origin AS that can be detected by RPKI and BGP monitoring systems. In the data plane, this attack will not cause a global loss of connectivity to the victim’s domain like the traditional sub-prefix hijack.

#### 2.2.3 Prepended Sub-Prefix Hijack
**Attack Methodology:**
An adversary can increase the stealthiness of a sub-prefix hijack attack by prepending the victim’s Autonomous System Number (ASN) in the malicious announcement’s AS path. Thus, the AS path will begin with the victim’s ASN followed by the adversary’s ASN. Importantly, the adversary’s AS is no longer claiming to be the origin AS for the prefix. Instead, the adversary is simply claiming a topological connection to the victim (that does not in fact exist).

**Attack Viability:**
The viability of this attack is identical to that of the traditional sub-prefix hijack attack because routers always prefer a more specific BGP announcement over a less-specific one regardless of the AS-path field. Thus, all victims that have an IP prefix shorter than `/24` are vulnerable.

**Attack Stealthiness:**
This attack is significantly more stealthy than a traditional sub-prefix hijack, particularly in the control plane. The origin ASN in the adversary’s announcement is identical to the victim’s ASN in the original announcement. BGP monitoring systems that only perform origin AS check will not be able to detect this attack. More advanced techniques such as data-plane measurements [42, 26] are needed to detect the attack. However, these advanced systems often require human intervention to take action on a flagged route, which may take hours [9].

On the data plane, this attack has a similar global effect to the traditional sub-prefix attack. However, due to control-plane stealthiness, an adversary will likely launch this attack (instead of a traditional sub-prefix hijack attack) to increase stealthiness with no effect on viability.

#### 2.2.4 Prepended Equally-Specific Prefix Hijack
**Attack Methodology:**
Similar to the prepended sub-prefix attack, an adversary can prepend the victim’s ASN to an equally-specific-prefix hijack. Because the adversary is now announcing the same prefix as the victim with the same origin ASN, this attack has a significant increase in stealthiness over all previously listed attacks.

**Attack Viability:**
This attack is even less viable than a traditional equally-specific prefix hijack. AS-path length is an important factor in route selection. Because the adversary’s route is made one hop longer by prepending the victim’s ASN, the adversary’s announcement will attract less traffic than it does in the traditional equally-specific prefix hijack. In many other applications, this can significantly limit the use of such an attack, but when attacking the PKI, the adversary only needs to intercept traffic from one of many trusted CAs. Thus, this attack can still be viable even with the reduced area of effect.

**Attack Stealthiness:**
This attack has similar control plane properties to the prepended sub-prefix hijack. The prepended victim origin AS makes the attack less likely to be detected by BGP monitoring systems. Thus, the attack is very stealthy. On the data plane, it is similar to the traditional equally-specific prefix hijack, which does not cause global loss of connectivity.

#### 2.2.5 Sub-Prefix Interception with Path Poisoning
**Attack Methodology:**
While all previous attacks have involved breaking data-plane connectivity to a victim’s domain (either global or partial), we here present an attack that uses AS-path poisoning to maintain a valid route to the victim’s domain. Our attack allows an adversary to fully man-in-the-middle encrypted TLS traffic (as opposed to only attacking unencrypted traffic [39]).

In our attack, an adversary announces a sub-prefix of the victim’s original announcement, similar to the sub-prefix hijack attack. The crucial difference is that the adversary will append a legitimate route R to the victim following the adversary’s own ASN in the announced path. This causes the ASes along route R between the adversary and the victim to ignore the adversary’s announcement because of loop prevention. These ASes would still prefer the victim’s original announcement, and thus route R is still a valid route to the victim. All of the ASes not on route R would prefer the adversary’s announcement because of the adversary’s more-specific prefix announcement. Thus, the entire Internet (with the exception of the ASes on route R) routes traffic destined to the victim’s domain to the adversary, and the adversary can still forward all the traffic through to the victim via a valid route without breaking data-plane connectivity.

**Attack Viability:**
This attack can be performed by any multi-homed AS against a domain on a prefix shorter than `/24`. It is crucial that the adversary’s AS be multi-homed (have more than one provider) so at least one provider can deliver the victim’s traffic to the adversary while another provider forwards the traffic to the victim.

**Attack Stealthiness:**
This attack is completely stealthy in the data plane in terms of connectivity. Once the adversary makes the announcement, it can continue forwarding traffic to the victim via the valid route to maintain data connectivity. In addition, the adversary can use the bogus certificate gained in this attack to not only fake a victim’s website but to fully man-in-the-middle all TLS connections. The adversary can decrypt TLS traffic by posing as the victim’s domain to users. It can then forward the user traffic to the victim’s domain to hide the attack. This ensures that there is no connectivity issue from the victim’s perspective while a full man-in-the-middle attack is underway on TLS connections.

This attack also has a high degree of stealthiness in the control plane. Many networks will announce sub-prefixes on occasion for traffic engineering. Because the adversary’s announcement has the victim as the origin AS of the prefix and a valid path to the victim, this announcement will look similar to a legitimate route. In addition, because of BGP loop prevention, the ASes along route R may never notice this malicious announcement.

### 3 Launching Ethical Attacks in the Wild
We successfully performed all the attacks in Section 2 in an ethical manner on the real Internet using trusted CAs.

#### 3.1 Experimental Setup
Our experimental setup consisted of an adversarial server and a victim server. Each server was configured to make BGP announcements and forward packets through the muxes in the PEERING testbed [40].

In this experiment, we will consider a victim server in Ohio that is connected to a mux in the Los Nettos Regional Network in Los Angeles over a VPN tunnel, and an adversarial server sited in London that is connected to a mux at the Amsterdam Internet Exchange over another VPN tunnel (shown in Figure 3). Note that the adversary has two different upstream providers, making it multi-homed and capable of launching AS-path poisoning attacks.

#### 3.2 Real-World BGP Attacks
**Control Setup:**
We start by announcing a `/23` IP prefix we controlled to the Los Nettos Regional Network. Internet traffic to the victim’s domain came through the Los Nettos Regional Network to the victim’s server.

**3.2.1 Sub-Prefix Hijack Execution:**
We left the victim’s network configuration untouched and then used the adversarial server in London to make malicious BGP announcements for a more specific `/24` prefix containing the victim’s domain through the mux at the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. We then waited several minutes for the announcement to propagate. We subsequently approached leading certificate authorities and requested a certificate for the victim’s domain. Because the domain resolved to an IP in the hijacked sub-prefix, we were able to complete the domain control verification process without any access to the victim’s server. We also successfully repeated this process using a prepended sub-prefix hijack attack where the victim’s ASN was prepended to the adversary’s announcement.

**3.2.2 Equally-Specific Prefix Hijack Execution:**
Using a similar configuration to the sub-prefix attacks, we announced the same `/23` prefix as the victim from the mux at the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. Because these attacks do not affect traffic globally, we used ICMP Ping to determine which ASes had been hijacked by our announcement.
