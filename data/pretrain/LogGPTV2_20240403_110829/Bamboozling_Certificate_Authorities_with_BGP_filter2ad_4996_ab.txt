preﬁxes over less-speciﬁc ones, this announcement will
capture all trafﬁc to the victim’s domain, as demonstrated
in Figure 2b. This attack is highly effective and can be
launched by any AS on the Internet.
Attack Viability: This attack is highly viable. The
majority of domains use IP preﬁxes shorter than the max-
imum /24 (shown in Section 4.2), which allows an at-
tacker to announce IP sub-preﬁxes without being ﬁltered
(many ASes ﬁlter announcements longer than /24 [9]).
Additionally, the attack has a global effect and the adver-
sary’s location does not inﬂuence the attack viability.
Attack Stealthiness: Although effective, this attack
is very visible in both the control and data planes. As
seen in Figure 2b, all trafﬁc from any AS on the Inter-
net is routed to the adversary.
In the data plane, this
causes a nearly global loss of connectivity to the vic-
tim’s domain.
In addition, from a control-plane view-
point, the announcement is highly suspicious. The adver-
sary’s AS has likely never announced the victim’s preﬁx
before. When the adversary originates the victim’s pre-
ﬁx (an event known as a Multiple Origin AS, MOAS,
conﬂict [49]), many BGP monitoring systems [30, 42,
29, 26] will ﬂag this announcement because of the sus-
picious change in origin AS. Furthermore, if the victim
has an RPKI entry for their IP preﬁx, this announcement
will be ﬁltered by ASes that perform Route Origin Val-
idation (ROV) [17]. Thus, although an adversary could
easily get a certiﬁcate before the attack is detected (as we
will show in Section 3, several CAs will sign a certiﬁcate
seconds after domain control veriﬁcation and these at-
tacks can last for several hours), the rapid detection of
this announcement would reduce the damage the bogus
certiﬁcate could do.
2.2.2 Traditional Equally-Speciﬁc-Preﬁx Hijack
Attack Methodology: An adversary aiming to in-
crease stealthiness (or attack a domain running in a /24
preﬁx so a sub-preﬁx attack is not viable) may launch an
equally-speciﬁc-preﬁx hijack [22]. In this attack, an ad-
versary announces the exact same preﬁx that the victim is
announcing. Each AS will then pick the preferred route

Table 1. At a high level, each attack in the lower table
is more preferable to an adversary because it is stealthier
and less detectable by existing BGP security measures
and data-plane measurements. However, these stealthier
attacks are less likely to be viable for a given adversary.
The viability and stealthiness of each attack is shown in
Table 2. We later use these observations to asses the vul-
nerability of the PKI to BGP attacks of varying levels of
stealthiness in Section 4.
2.2.1 Traditional Sub-Preﬁx Hijack
Attack Methodology: The adversary makes a BGP
announcement to a sub-preﬁx that includes the victim
domain’s IP. For example, to attack a victim domain on
the IP address X.Y.Z.1 of preﬁx X.Y.Z.0/23, an adver-
sary could launch a sub-preﬁx attack announcing the pre-
ﬁx X.Y.Z.0/24 to capture the victim’s trafﬁc. Figure 2a
shows the default routing of trafﬁc when no attack is
active, and Figure 2b shows the effects of a sub-preﬁx
hijack attack. Because routers prefer more-speciﬁc IP

between the adversary’s false announcement and the vic-
tim’s original announcement, based on local preferences
and path length, etc.. As shown in Figure 2c, this type
of attack causes only part of the Internet to prefer the ad-
versary’s announcement. In parts of the Internet that do
not prefer the adversary’s route, this attack is unnotice-
able in the data plane (connectivity is unaffected). Also,
in the control plane, many ASes will not learn (let alone
choose) the adversary’s route.
Attack Viability: The viability of this attack is deter-
mined by the topological relationship between the CA,
the victim, and the adversary. The Internet topology
must cause the adversary’s route to be preferred by the
CA over the victim’s route. Thus, this attack is less vi-
able than a traditional sub-preﬁx hijack. We will further
quantify the viability of this attack in Section 4.3.1.
Attack Stealthiness:
In the control plane, this at-
tack is more stealthy than a traditional sub-preﬁx hijack
because parts of the Internet will not hear the adver-
sary’s announcement. However, this attack still involves
a change in origin AS that can be detected by RPKI and
BGP monitoring systems. In the data plane, this attack
will not cause a global loss of connectivity to the victim’s
domain like the traditional sub-preﬁx hijack.
2.2.3 Prepended Sub-Preﬁx Hijack
Attack Methodology: An adversary can increase the
stealthiness of a sub-preﬁx hijack attack by prepending
the victim’s Autonomous System Number (ASN) in the
malicious announcement’s AS path. Thus, the AS path
will begin with the victim’s ASN followed by the adver-
sary’s ASN. Importantly, the adversary’s AS is no longer
claiming to be the origin AS for the preﬁx. Instead the
adversary is simply claiming a topological connection to
the victim (that does not in fact exist).
Attack Viability: The viability of this attack is iden-
tical to that of the traditional sub-preﬁx hijack attack
because routers always prefer a more speciﬁc BGP an-
nouncement over a less-speciﬁc one regardless of the
AS-path ﬁeld. Thus, all victims that have an IP preﬁx
shorter than /24 are vulnerable.
Attack Stealthiness: This attack is signiﬁcantly more
stealthy than a traditional sub-preﬁx hijack, particularly
in the control plane. The origin ASN in the adversary’s
announcement is identical to the victim’s ASN in the
original announcement. BGP monitoring systems that
only perform origin AS check will not be able to detect
this attack. More advanced techniques such as data-plane
measurements [42, 26] are needed to detect the attack.
However, these advanced systems often require human
intervention to take action on a ﬂagged route, which may
take hours [9].
On the data plane, this attack has a similar global effect
to traditional sub-preﬁx attack. However, due to control-
plane stealthiness, an adversary will likely launch this
attack (instead of a traditional sub-preﬁx hijack attack)
to increase stealthiness with no effect on viability.
2.2.4 Prepended Equally-Speciﬁc-Preﬁx Hijack
Attack Methodology: Similar to the prepended sub-
preﬁx attack, an adversary can prepend the victim’s ASN
to an equally-speciﬁc-preﬁx hijack. Because the adver-
sary is now announcing the same preﬁx as the victim
with the same origin ASN, this attack is has a signiﬁcant
increase in stealthiness over all previously listed attacks.
Attack Viability: This attack is even less viable than a
traditional equally-speciﬁc preﬁx hijack. AS-path length
is an important factor in route selection. Because the ad-
versary’s route is made one hop longer by prepending the
victim’s ASN, the adversary’s announcement will attract
less trafﬁc than it does in the traditional equally-speciﬁc
preﬁx hijack. In many other applications, this can signif-
icantly limit the use of such an attack, but when attacking
the PKI, the adversary only needs to intercept trafﬁc from
one of many trusted CAs. Thus, this attack can still be
viable even with the reduced area of effect.
Attack Stealthiness: This attack has similar control
plane properties to the prepended sub-preﬁx hijack. The
prepended victim origin AS makes the attack less likely
to be detected by BGP monitoring systems. Thus, the
attack is very stealthy. On the data plane, it is similar to
the traditional equally-speciﬁc preﬁx hijack which does

2.2.5 Sub-Preﬁx-Interception With Path Poisoning
Attack Methodology: While all previous attacks have
involved breaking data-plane connectivity to a victim’s
domain (either global or partial), we here present an
attack that uses AS-path poisoning to maintain a valid
route to the victim’s domain. Our attack allows an ad-
versary to fully man-in-the-middle encrypted TLS trafﬁc
(as opposed to only attacking unencrypted trafﬁc [39]).
In our attack, an adversary announces a sub-preﬁx of the
victim’s original announcement similar to the sub-preﬁx
hijack attack. The crucial difference is that the adversary
will append a legitimate route R to the victim following
the adversary’s own ASN in the announced path. This
causes the ASes along route R between the adversary
and the victim to ignore the adversary’s announcement
because of loop prevention. These ASes would still pre-
fer the victim’s original announcement, and thus route R
is still a valid route to the victim. All of the ASes not on
route R would prefer the adversary’s announcement be-
cause of the adversary’s more-speciﬁc preﬁx announce-
ment. Thus, the entire Internet (with the exception of the
ASes on route R) routes trafﬁc destined to the victim’s
domain to the adversary, and the adversary can still for-
ward all the trafﬁc through to the victim via a valid route
without breaking data-plane connectivity.
Attack Viability: This attack can be performed by
any multi-homed AS against a domain on a preﬁx shorter
than /24. It is crucial that the adversary’s AS be multi-
homed (have more than one provider) so at least one
provider can deliver the victim’s trafﬁc to the adversary
while another provider forwards the trafﬁc to the victim.
Attack Stealthiness: This attack is completely
stealthy in the data plane in terms of connectivity. Once
the adversary makes the announcement, it can continue
forwarding trafﬁc to the victim via the valid route to
maintain data connectivity. In addition, the adversary can
use the bogus certiﬁcate gained in this attack to not only
fake a victim’s website but to fully man-in-the-middle all
TLS connections. The adversary can decrypt TLS trafﬁc
by posing as the victim’s domain to users. It can then
forward the user trafﬁc to the victim’s domain to hide
the attack. This ensures that there is no connectivity is-
sue from the victim’s perspective while a full man-in-the-
middle attack is under way on TLS connections.
This attack also has a high degree of stealthiness in
the control plane. Many networks will announce sub-
preﬁxes on occasion for trafﬁc engineering. Because the
adversary’s announcement has the victim as the origin
AS of the preﬁx and a valid path to the victim, this an-
nouncement will look similar to a legitimate route. In ad-
dition, because of BGP loop prevention, the ASes along

route R may never notice this malicious announcement.
3 Launching Ethical Attacks in the Wild
We successfully performed all the attacks in Section 2 in
an ethical manner on the real Internet using trusted CAs.
3.1 Experimental Setup
Our experimental setup consisted of an adversarial server
and a victim server. Each server was conﬁgured to
make BGP announcements and forward packets through
the muxes in the PEERING testbed [40].
In this ex-
periement, we will consider a victim server in Ohio that
is connected to a mux in the Los Nettos Regional Net-
work in Los Angeles over a VPN tunnel, and an adver-
sarial server sited in London that is connected to a mux
at the Amsterdam Internet Exchange over another VPN
tunnel (shown in Figure 3). Note that the adversary has
two different upstream providers, making it multi-homed
and capable of launching AS-path poisoning attacks.
3.2 Real-World BGP Attacks
Control Setup. We start by announcing a /23 IP preﬁx
we controlled to the Los Nettos Regional Network. Inter-
net trafﬁc to the victim’s domain came through the Los
Nettos Regional Network to the victim’s server.
3.2.1 Sub-Preﬁx Hijack Execution
We left the victim’s network conﬁguration untouched,
and then used the adversarial server in London to make
malicious BGP announcements for a more speciﬁc /24
preﬁx containing the victim’s domain through the mux
at the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. We then waited
several minutes for the announcement to propagate. We

and requested a certiﬁcate for the victim’s domain. Be-
cause the domain resolved to an IP in the hijacked sub-
preﬁx, we were able to complete the domain control
veriﬁcation process without any access to the victim’s
server. We also successfully repeated this process using
a prepended sub-preﬁx hijack attack where the victim’s
ASN was prepended to the adversary’s announcement.
3.2.2 Equally-Speciﬁc-Preﬁx Hijack Execution
Using a similar conﬁguration to the sub-preﬁx attacks,
we announced the same /23 preﬁx as the victim from the
mux at the Amsterdam Internet Exchange. Because these
attacks do not affect trafﬁc globally, we used ICMP Ping
to determine which ASes had been hijacked by our an-
