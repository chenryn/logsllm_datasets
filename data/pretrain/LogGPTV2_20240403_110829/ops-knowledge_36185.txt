Question: "Why would configuring 'Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://trusted.partner.com' alongside 'X-Frame-Options: DENY' not be an effective strategy for allowing only https://trusted.partner.com to frame your website?"
 "A": "Because 'X-Frame-Options: DENY' will override the 'Content-Security-Policy' and disallow framing from all sources, including https://trusted.partner.com."
 "B": "Because 'Content-Security-Policy' is not supported by all browsers and 'X-Frame-Options' should be used exclusively."
 "C": "Because 'X-Frame-Options' does not support allowing specific domains and will cause conflicts with the 'Content-Security-Policy'."
 "D": "Because specifying a specific domain in 'Content-Security-Policy' is not valid syntax and will be ignored by browsers."
Answer: A
