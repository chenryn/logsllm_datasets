when having an accordion `.accordion-toggle` gets class `collapsed` when
specified section is collapsed.
however, this hapens only when clicking on the same handler.
example: http://jsfiddle.net/DRfbh/
red background indicates that `.accordion-toggle` does not have class
`collapsed`.
Clicking on the first item, works ok, but when clicking any other item, opened
section is collapsed, but class is not added to the `.accordion-toggle`
