## Abstract

Over the past few years, Proximity-based People Discovery (PBPD) services, such as Nearby Friends, have gained popularity in geosocial apps. Unlike their predecessors, which directly pinpointed users' exact locations, PBPD services provide coarse-grained (discretized) proximity information, like "Jennifer is within 2 miles," balancing privacy and functionality. Many companies, including Facebook, are promoting these features, fostering the perception that sharing coarse-grained proximity information is harmless. This paper introduces a novel positioning attack that can locate PBPD service users with high precision using only this coarse-grained information. The attack requires no specialized hardware or server-side collusion and can be easily automated. We design and implement the Geosocial Positioning System (GsPS), which can locate users with high precision (within 10m) in a few minutes under real-world settings. GsPS is also capable of performing city-scale scanning and long-term profiling at low costs. The public and social network industry should be aware of the potential risks associated with this attack and use PBPD services cautiously.

## 1. Introduction

Proximity-Based People Discovery (PBPD) has become increasingly popular in geosocial apps over the past few years. It allows users to discover, learn about, and interact with others nearby, bridging online social activities and the physical world. Users share their exact locations with the service provider, which then provides a list of nearby users ranked by geographical proximity. While the service provider knows the exact location of every user, it only discloses coarse-grained proximity information, such as "Jennifer is within 2 miles." This model is perceived to be safer in terms of location privacy and is widely adopted by popular apps like Facebook.

However, we demonstrate that this perceived safety is false by presenting an effective positioning attack. This attack shows that coarse-grained proximity information, generally believed to be innocuous, can be exploited to infer users' locations with high precision (within 10m) in a matter of a few minutes. The proposed attack adapts the well-known triangulation technique to the unique properties of geosocial apps. By measuring the target's distance to a series of strategically selected reference locations (users), the target's candidate area can be effectively reduced. Based on this attack, we design and implement the Geosocial Positioning System (GsPS), which requires neither specialized hardware nor server-side collusion and can be easily automated for city-scale scanning and long-term profiling at negligible costs. We test GsPS on two representative real-world apps with PBPD services: Facebook and Grindr. Our experimental results show that GsPS is highly effective in practical settings.

## 2. Attack Overview

### 2.1 Threat Model

The proposed attack enables an adversary to precisely locate other users using the same PBPD service. A victim can be any ordinary user whose proximity information is visible to the attacker. A prior trust relationship may be required if the geosocial app discloses proximity information only between friends. The threat of this attack depends on how each app balances three aspects: (1) the granularity of proximity information, (2) who can access proximity information, and (3) the frequency of updating proximity information. For example, a service that allows a stranger to continuously track your exact location is more disturbing and riskier than one that only discloses coarse-grained proximity information to your friends when you explicitly check in.

### 2.2 Basic Design

Triangulation is a commonly used technique for locating objects. By precisely measuring the target's distances to three or more references, its exact location can be computed by intersecting the circles (or spheres) centered at each reference with the measured distance as the radius. However, applying triangulation to PBPD is challenging due to the discretized formats of proximity information, which give different implications on the actual location of a user. Direct application of the traditional triangulation algorithm on PBPD services typically results in a rough candidate area spanning hundreds of meters or even several kilometers.

To address this challenge, we design an iterative positioning algorithm that can infer a user's exact location with high precision, even with discretized proximity information. Our algorithm reduces the candidate area by scanning at a series of strategically selected reference locations. Each scan partitions the candidate area into concentric rings, keeping one of them. We show that this reduction is very effective if the reference locations are carefully chosen. Our algorithm selects each reference location to minimize the expected area of the candidate space after scanning.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our positioning algorithm by measuring the number of steps (scans) required to achieve a specified positioning precision. The fewer scans an algorithm requires, the less time and resources are consumed, and the less suspicious the attacker will appear. We adopt the proximity format used by Facebook, where proximity information is discretized to mile granularity when larger than one mile and to half-mile when smaller than one mile. We measure the number of steps taken to achieve a precision of 10m, with the attacker initialized at 1 mile, 5 miles, and 10 miles away from the target. The experiments are repeated 100 times under each setting, and the corresponding Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) are plotted. The simulation results indicate that 10–20 scans are sufficient to locate the target with high precision, demonstrating that our positioning algorithm is effective enough for real-world attacks, though some level of automation is required.

### 2.3 GsPS: Geosocial Positioning System

GsPS consists of four components:
1. A standalone attack engine written in Java, providing universal algorithmic support for the triangulation attack.
2. Android emulators installed with mock location providers and customized plugins for various PBPD apps.
3. Server-side encapsulation (called Drone) of the Android emulator, which bridges the attack engine and the Android emulators.
4. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) for debugging and testing.

The app logging plugins automatically extract proximity information by intercepting interactions between the app and the Android framework. This information is synced with the attack engine using the Drone interface. Each Drone instance communicates with the corresponding emulator via the Android Debugging Bridge (ADB). An attacker can distribute workloads among multiple emulators to speed up the positioning process or achieve higher throughput.

## 3. Experimental Results

We host GsPS on a workstation with four Intel Xeon(R) CPUs (3.2GHz) and 16GB RAM, configured to terminate when the maximum error (worst possible precision) reduces to less than 30m. We test GsPS under three representative scenarios using real-world apps.

### Attack Scenario 1: Locating a Random Stranger

An attacker wants to locate a random stranger while browsing an app providing PBPD service among strangers. We test this scenario on Grindr, a geo-social app geared towards gay, bisexual, and bi-curious men, with over one million daily active users in 192 countries. The exact location of each Grindr user is sensitive given the nature of the user group. Grindr provides continuous proximity information when less than 1km and discretized to km when larger than 1km. We registered two accounts on Grindr—one as the target and the other as the attacker—and mounted our positioning attack with GsPS. The attacker is initialized at a random location within a 30km radius of the target. The results (50 trials) of our positioning attack on Grindr are shown in Figure 4.

### Attack Scenario 2: Scalable Attack on Multiple Users

A dedicated attacker wants to locate all Grindr users within a specific area. We launch a scalable attack by initializing five emulators at random locations in the San Francisco area. These emulators independently scan and locate their nearby friends and merge the results, i.e., estimated locations of the targets. As shown in Figure 5, GsPS located 60 different users in less than 10 minutes, with varying effectiveness depending on the area. The attack is more effective in crowded areas, such as downtown, and less effective in suburban areas where users are scattered.

### Attack Scenario 3: Long-Term Profiling

An attacker interested in a specific user tries to profile them over time and extract their Points of Interest (PoIs). Facebook recently released a proximity-based Nearby Friends feature, which notifies users in real-time when their friends are nearby. This feature allows an attacker to build a timestamped view of a user's locations during a certain period, posing profiling threats. We fed a Facebook user a 10-hour location trace of a real user in San Francisco and located them using GsPS. We find that GsPS can effectively identify PoIs (location clusters in Figure 6) but may miss location points when the user is constantly moving.

## 4. Conclusion

Of all variants of Location-Based People Discovery services (LBPDs), the proximity-based ones are the most widely deployed due to their natural preservation of privacy. Our positioning attack, however, undermines the foundation of PBPD features, showing that they are not any safer than directly disclosing a user's exact location to others. This attack assumes neither specialized hardware nor server-side collusion and can be easily automated. This new attack vector poses serious threats to the social network industry and draws attention from the research community. Although numerous location protection mechanisms have been proposed for friend discovery services in geosocial networks, it remains unclear whether they can achieve reasonable trade-offs between usability, performance, and privacy on this new attack. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rethink proximity-based social features, considering all potential risks introduced by this attack.
