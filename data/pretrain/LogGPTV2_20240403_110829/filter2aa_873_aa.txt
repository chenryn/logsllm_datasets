### Staring into the Abyss: The Dark Side of Crime Fighting, Security, and Professional Intelligence

#### Notes and Comments

**Why Security Fails**

As of 2010, Frost & Sullivan estimated that there were 2.28 million information security professionals worldwide. An experienced security practitioner humorously remarked, "It sounds better if you make air quotes when you say 'information security professionals.'"

**The Situation**

We are all in this together. Hacking and hackers exist on a spectrum, often described as gray hat. A black hat hacker is a hacker. A gray hat hacker is one who knows when to bend the truth. A white hat hacker is one who has lost track of the truth. The world is inherently gray, and hacking, being a subset of the world, is also gray.

Those who define a paradigm do not need to worry about answers; they determine the questions that can be asked. They know the size and shape of the picture because they create the frame.

Years ago, I referred to "real birds in digital cages." Now, I would say, "real flocks of birds in digital cages." The simulated beating wings above, below, and on both sides provide an illusion of security, of being part of the herd, the team, the tribe. Our own beating wings give an illusion of freedom, but the cage slowly turns and positions us where it will.

We are all assimilated. We are the Borg-R-Us.

Anthropologist Margaret Mead said it takes a full year to learn how to see what she learns in the first week in a new culture because she is assimilated so quickly and unconsciously. The frames of her perceptual lenses are immediately recontextualized by the cues, however exotic, in response to her statements.

In any organizational culture, we learn to behave according to known but unwritten rules. The written rules, found in the thick book given to new hires, soon become written and unknown as they gather dust on the shelf. There are four kinds of rules: known and written, unknown and written, unknown and unwritten, and known and unwritten. The known and unwritten rules are the ones we must learn to survive.

These rules define team players and whistleblowers, us and them, and Team America. They make a less-than-absolute good or value seem absolute through agreement, reinforcement, fear of consequences, legal agreements, and more. This is true for investigative reporters, spiritual or religious individuals, and anyone who speaks out, potentially becoming labeled as a terrorist. Penalties escalate based on the alleged intention and allegiance of the speaker, who becomes a perpetrator.

"The weakest link in the chain is frequently the definition of the problem, and the definition of the problem is often not what we think," said Matt Blaze.

Who are we, then? What is the "security space"? What does our self-referential narrative about the "industry" include and exclude? What is the rule base of the filter, and how well does it work at the perimeter? Where have we put the truth, and what is it?

Nothing is harder to see than things we believe so deeply that we don't even see them. This is true in the "security space," where our narratives are self-referential, bounded by mutual self-interest, and characterized by groupthink. As the saying goes, "If everyone is thinking the same thing, someone isn’t thinking." Original, far-seeing insight is not always rewarded; in fact, it is often punished.

My story: To change the paradigm, one way or another, you have to leave. Timothy Leary said, "You never get the truth from the company memo." Your individual identity, with its flexible boundaries, is absorbed into the corporate identity. The more successful you are in a particular culture, the more your speech articulates the company line, the myth, the simple cover story many have come to believe. Think of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," where someone you know opens their mouth, and out comes an alien ululation. This movie has been remade repeatedly because it conveys the truth of McCarthyism and applies to our current context.

**The Result**

Analyzing deeper political and economic structures reveals behaviors and beliefs in a different light, illuminating mixed motives and the interpenetration of legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. The overworld and the underworld form a complex system, a planetary economy and society.

There is a significant impact on security and intelligence practitioners—on their psyches, relationships, and lives—when their work constantly confronts them with the abrasive interface of mixed motives. Cognitive dissonance is always present and, unless it leads to serious emotional stress, is the least of our worries.

Twelve-step programs promise regeneration of our deepest being and say, "We are only as sick as our secrets." But life in the national security state, the security space, and the intelligence "community" is founded on secrecy, millions of classified documents, and compartmented worlds.

"I am getting more and more cynical all the time and I still can’t keep up," said Jane Wagner. What does it do to a human being to live with frightening secrets—frightening because they confront us with the truth of ourselves and the myth of righteousness can no longer be sustained? Here is one story... [insert story of Washington DC dinner].

**The Intention Behind This Presentation**

This analysis aims to make you think twice before uncritically using the buzzwords and jargon of the security profession—words like "security," "defense," "cyberwar," "terrorism," and "the enemy." By the end of this presentation, simplistic distinctions between foreign and domestic, us and them, will blur, while the complexities of information security remain. Niels Bohr said, "If quantum mechanics hasn’t shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet." Similarly, anyone doing security or intelligence work who does not experience cognitive dissonance has lost touch with the points of reference for their humanity and the real big picture in which we are all actors.

**Example: Security Professionals Under Pressure**

A study by (ISC)² and Frost & Sullivan in 2011 found that security professionals are overwhelmed by the growing attack surface, including mobile devices, the cloud, social networking, and insecure applications. Many feel that their jobs are too much for them. Application vulnerabilities ranked as the top threat, with only 20% involved in secure software development. Mobile devices were the second-highest concern, despite 70% having policies and technology in place. Cloud computing and social media threats also highlight a skills gap. Most security pros aren't ready for these challenges, and nearly two-thirds don't expect budget increases for personnel and training in 2011.

Nietzsche warned, "Whoever battles monsters should take care not to become a monster too. For if you stare long enough into the Abyss, the Abyss stares also into you." This presentation is not about giving you three things to do at the office tomorrow. Instead, it aims to reflect on who we are, not by looking at what we assert, but by observing our behavior. We should think realistically about our work and lives in the context of the political and economic realities of the security profession, professional intelligence, and global meta-national corporate structures.

"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, refuses to go away," said P. K. Dick.

**Thinking About Security**

Discussions of security often focus on statements about "security," suggesting a condition of primary naiveté. Security has a context. Turning context into content, i.e., illuminating the slightly bigger box, gives mastery over not only security but life, the universe, and everything.

Eddie Bernays' work, such as "Torches of Freedom," "Bookcases and Books," and the overthrow of Arbenz in Guatemala, exemplifies how this happens. We still have beliefs, but we do not believe in them in the same way. We contextualize them differently and understand them better. This does not always happen at security conferences, where rhetoric reinforces the narrative, including sales pitches and marketing.

Cultural studies of media, to which I will refer, are about beliefs and the management of perception in the mind of society. The world divides into people who believe in their beliefs in a primary, naive way and those who don’t.

Security in the real world is about what works. A monk once asked, "Why do we bow at the Zen Center?" We bow because things seem to work better when we bow. This is practical spirituality, applicable to work and life alike. What actions make things work better when we do them?

This presentation aims to put what we hear at conferences into context—the social, economic, or political dimensions of security and how they affect our behavior and what we say. We may still make the same claims, but we will not believe in them in the same way. We will quietly critique our own blather, if only inside our heads.

There is a way to hold all of this without becoming arrogant, superior, or smarmy. We are all merely human. No one has the high moral ground. We all swim in the same water, as Jake Gittes said in "Chinatown." Our real challenge is to be willing to be human, enthusiastically and robustly, not less than human. Not the Borg.

**The Dark Side**

James Baldwin said, "The price one pays for pursuing any profession or calling is an intimate knowledge of its ugly side." If we do not know that ugly side, we do not know the profession—or ourselves. The price we pay for self-awareness is an intimate knowledge of our ugly sides, too. So another title for this talk is: know yourself.

One place to look is the exploration of deep politics, as in Peter Dale Scott's "Deep Politics and the Death of JFK." There is an important distinction between traditional conspiracy theory, conscious secret collaborations toward shared ends, and deep political analysis, the study of practices and arrangements, deliberate or not, which are usually repressed rather than acknowledged. In deep politics, there is an open system with divergent power centers and goals, not a single objective or control point.

Deep political systems or processes habitually resort to decision-making and enforcement procedures outside those publicly sanctioned by law and society. They are covert and suppressed, outside general awareness and acknowledged political processes. For example, criminal structures are often tolerated by police because of their usefulness in informing on lesser criminals, as seen in the Whitey Bulger case. The same is true for the intelligence community. In Chicago, there is a police-criminal symbiosis, and the mob controls civic life, its economic, political, and social underpinnings. Its depth and persistence create the frame.

Due to morphing geopolitical structures into what we now call meta-national stage-managed globalism, competitive intelligence and "economic patriotism" are indistinguishable from state-based intelligence operations. When Jan Hering moved from the CIA to Motorola, it marked a shift in what trans-nationals had become and what meta-nationals would become.

I keynoted twice for a Microsoft Israel conference and shared the platform with Steve Ballmer. My job was to enhance his credibility when he spoke about taking security seriously, as required by the market and changing global conditions. Bill Gates is no worse than Larry Ellison, Scott McNealy, or Steve Jobs. To achieve their positions, you must be a robber baron and use all means necessary to secure intellectual property, from taking the property to taking the human head that knows the details, using the whole repertoire of techniques used by the IC.
