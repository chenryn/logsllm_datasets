Staring into the Abyss:  
The Dark Side of Crime Fighting, Security, and Professional Intelligence 
Notes and Comments 
WHY SECURITY SUCKS  
As of 2010, Frost & Sullivan estimates that there are 2.28 million information 
security professionals worldwide.  
to which an experienced security practitioner replied: 
“it sounds better if you make air quotes when you say information security 
professionals.” 
THE SITUATION  
We are all in this together. all hacking and all hackers are gray hat. 
a black hat hacker is a hacker. 
a gray hat hacker is a hacker who knows when to fudge the truth. 
a white hat hacker is a hacker who put the truth down somewhere and can’t remember 
where he left it. 
the world is gray. hacking is a subset of the world. therefore, hacking is gray.  
Those who define a paradigm do not need to worry about answers, because they 
determine the questions that can be asked.  They know the size and shape of the picture 
because they create the frame. 
Years ago I referred to “real birds kin digital cages.” Now I would say, “real flocks of 
birds in digital cages.” The simulated beating wings above and below and on both sides 
provide an illusion of security, being part of the herd, the team, the tribe,  and our own 
beating wings provide an illusion of the freedom of flight. But the cage slowly turns and 
positions us where it will. 
We are all assimilated. The Borg-R-Us. 
Margaret Mead , noted anthropologist, said it takes a full year to learn how to see what 
she learns in the first week in a new culture because she is assimilated so quickly and 
unconsciously into the culture.  The frames of her perceptual lenses are immediately 
recontextualized by the cues, however exotic, in response to her statements.

In any organizational culture, we learn how to behave according to known but unwritten 
rules. The written rules, known only when we scan the thick book given to new hires, 
soon become written and unknown as they gather dust on the shelf in our cubicles.   
(there are four kinds of rules: known and written, unknown and written,  unknown and 
unwritten, and known and unwritten. The known and unwritten rules one had better learn 
or one won’t last.  
These rules define team players and whistle blowers. They define us and them. They 
define Team America, the tribe, our side, and all of the other ways we make a less than 
absolute good or value seem like an absolute good or value. We do that through 
agreement, reinforcement, a deeply embedded fear of consequences and reprisals, legal 
agreements, in short, everything that makes a seriously spiritual or religious human who 
takes a moral code seriously = an investigative reporter, if he or she speaks = a terrorist. 
Penalties escalate as The Powers categorize not the behavior, which is self-similar across 
those categories, but the alleged intention and allegiance of the speaker, who becomes a 
perp.  
“The weakest link in the chain is frequently the definition of the problem, and the 
definition of the problem is often not what we think” – Matt Blaze 
Who are we, then, really? What is the “security space” – really? What does our self-
referential narrative about the “industry” include and what does it EXCLUDE?  What is 
the rule-base of the filter and how well does it work at the perimeter?  
Where have we put the truth? and what really is it? 
Nothing is harder to see than things we believe so deeply we don't even see them. 
This is true in the "security space," in which our narratives are self-referential, bounded 
by mutual self-interest, and characterized by a heavy dose of group-think. It is true that, 
“if everyone is thinking the same thing, someone isn’t thinking,”  and it is also true that 
one is not always rewarded for original far-seeing insight. In fact, the contrary.  
My story: how do you change the paradigm? one way or another, you have to leave. 
Timothy Leary: “You never get the truth from the company memo.” Your individual 
identity, the boundary around it flexing and blurring, is absorbed into the corporate 
identity, and the more success you achieve in a particular culture, the more – when you 
open your mouth to speak – you articulate an instantiation of the Myth, the company line, 
the simple cover story many have come to believe.  Think “Invasion of the Body 
Snatchers” when someone you think you know opens their mouth and outcomes not 
familiar speech but an alien ululation.  That movie has been remade and remade again 
because it ports the truth of McCarthyism, to which it first referred, into our current 
context.

THE RESULT 
Analysis of deeper political and economic structures reveals behaviors and beliefs in a 
different light which illuminates mixed motives and the fact that legitimate and 
illegitimate enterprises interpenetrate one another deeply, yin-yangishly, the  overworld 
and the underworld making up one vanilla-and-chocolate swirl of pudding, one complex 
system, one planetary economy and society.  
There is also an serious impact on security and intelligence practitioners – on psyches, 
relationships, lives – when work brings one constantly up against the abrasive interface of 
those mixed motives. Cognitive dissonance is always present and the least of our worries, 
unless it leads to serious emotional stress.  
Twelve-step programs as a model promise regeneration of our deepest being and say, “we 
are only as sick as our secrets.” But life in the national security state, the security space, 
the intelligence “community” which permeates all meaningful communities -  is founded 
on secrecy millions of secrets, millions of classified documents, hundreds of thousands of 
compartmented worlds.  
“I am getting more and more cynical all the time and I still can’t keep up.” – Jane 
Wagner.  
What does it do to a human being to live with often-frightening secrets – frightening 
because they confront us with the truth of ourselves and the myth of righteousness can no 
longer be sustained? Here is one story ... [insert story of Washington DC dinner].  
THE INTENTION BEHIND THIS PRESENTATION 
This analysis will hopefully make you think twice before uncritically using the 
buzzwords and jargon of the security profession - words like "security" itself, and 
"defense," and "cyberwar," and “terrorism,” and “the enemy.”  
By the end of this presentation, simplistic distinctions between foreign and domestic and 
us and them will go liquid while the complexities of information security remain, 
bounded by a perimeter which has cased to be a perimeter, which is more like a moebius 
strip suggesting that the inside and the outside are really one thing. Niels Bohr said, “if 
quantum mechanics hasn’t shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet.” In a similar way, 
anyone doing security or intelligence work who does not experience cognitive dissonance 
has lost touch with the points of reference for his or her humanity – and the real big 
picture in which we are all actors, inside the frame.

Security Pros May Be Ready To Crack Under Growing Pressure,  Study Says

Faced with securing personal devices and a growing base of threats, security pros 
feel overwhelmed, (ISC)2 survey reports  
Feb 23, 2011  
By Tim Wilson 
Darkreading  
Faced with an attack surface that seems to be growing at an overwhelming rate, many 
security professionals are beginning to wonder whether their jobs are too much for them, 
according to a study published last week.  
Conducted by Frost & Sullivan, the 2011 (ISC)2 Global Information Security Workforce 
Study (GISWS) says new threats stemming from mobile devices, the cloud, social 
networking, and insecure applications have led to "information security professionals 
being stretched thin, and like a series of small leaks in a dam, the current overworked 
workforce may be showing signs of strain."  
"In the modern organization, end users are dictating IT priorities by bringing technology 
to the enterprise rather than the other way around," said Robert Ayoub, global program 
director for network security at Frost & Sullivan. "Pressure to secure too much and the 
resulting skills gap are creating risk for organizations worldwide ... They are being asked 
to do too much, with little time left to enhance their skills to meet the latest security 
threats and business demands."  
As of 2010, Frost & Sullivan estimates that there are 2.28 million information security 
professionals worldwide. Demand for professionals is expected to increase to nearly 4.2 
million by 2015, with a compound annual growth rate of 13.2 percent.  
Application vulnerabilities ranked as the No. 1 threat to organizations among 72 percent 
of respondents, while only 20 percent said they are involved in secure software 
development.  
Nearly 70 percent of respondents reported having policies and technology in place to 
meet the security challenges of mobile devices, yet mobile devices were still ranked 
second on the list of highest concerns by respondents. The study concludes that "mobile 
security could be the single most dangerous threat to organizations for the foreseeable 
future."  
Cloud computing illustrates a serious gap between technology implementation and the 
skills necessary to provide security. More than 50 percent of respondents reported having 
private clouds in place, while more than 70 percent reported the need for new skills to 
properly secure cloud-based technologies.  
5 
Most security pros aren't ready for social media threats. Respondents reported 
inconsistent policies and protection for end users visiting social media sites, and nearly 
30 percent had no social media security policies whatsoever.  
The main drivers for the continued growth of the profession are regulatory compliance 
demands, greater potential for data loss via mobile devices and mobile workforce, and the 
potential loss of control as organizations shift data to cloud-based services, the study 
says.  
Nearly two-thirds of respondents don't expect to see any increase in budget for 
information security personnel and training in 2011. Salaries showed healthy growth, 
with three out of five respondents reported receiving a salary increase in 2010. 
When Nietzsche said, "Whoever battles monsters should take care not to become a 
monster too, For if you stare long enough into the Abyss, the Abyss stares also into you." 
(Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, chapter 4, no. 146) he was warning us that becoming 
more fully aware has consequences. As a sign in Sandia National Lab's Physics 
Department says: "Do not look directly into the laser beam with your remaining eye."  
So this presentation is not one of those talks that gives you 3 things to do at the office in 
the morning. Ideally it will echo in the weeks and months ahead when you find 
yourselves in situations which recall it   The purpose is to reflect on who we are, not by 
looking at what we assert, but by observing our behavior – the same way we establish 
identity off and online -  so we can be more effective both as practitioners of our arts and 
crafts and also as more fully human beings. Ideally we will think realistically about our 
work and lives in the context of the political and economic realities of the security 
profession, professional intelligence and how it permeates work and life, and global 
meta-national corporate structures which are the source of political decisions and 
economic consequences, rather than explanations rooted in paradigms of the 20th century 
which were shaped by prior technologies. 
Here is an outline: 
- what we think we think 
- what we really think, based on what we do 
- political and economic analysis reveals a different world than the one we pretend to 
inhabit 
-competitive intelligence and nation-state intelligence blur in this world, altering the 
context of security and ethical considerations of our actions which have also radically 
changed as a result of technologies 
- the intelligence world since 1947, since 9/11, since before your birth – has exploded  
- global corporate structures such as banking and financial services and how they work 
- vendors and the security space 
- what security professionals, chatting at the digital water cooler, really think 
6 
- real threats 
- interpenetration of the intelligence community, the security world, and meta-national 
corporations 
- clipper revisited. why clipper? who was really the worrisome threat?  
- the yin/yang of official (law and order) and unofficial (criminal) enterprises 
- whistle blowing, accounting, real structures of mutuality feedback and accountability  
- how to build those structures in “functional networks” – thinking about AA and the like 
- the real tasks and challenges of security 
- 
things are not always what they seem, but they are always what they are 
“Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, refuses to go away.” – P. K. Dick 
THINKING ABOUT SECURITY  
Discussions of security and the security industry often focus on statements about 
“security.” This duh-sounding remark suggests a condition of primary naiveté, which is 
like reading for example the Bible in a literalist way, as if all statements are the same  
kind, devoid of historical context, outside time, space, genres, and culture – outside the 
context that gives them meaning, in other words, particular meanings at that, which 
meanings include sociological, psychological, economic, political, and cultural 
dimensions.  
Security has a context. Turning context into content, i.e. illuminating the slightly bigger 
box inside which we hope to find ourselves with “out of the box thinking,” gives mastery 
over not only security, but life, the universe, everything.    
Eddie Bernays and his work is a good example of how this happens. Torches of Freedom. 
Bookcases and books. Guatemala and the overthrow of Arbenz.  
We still have beliefs, in other words, but we do not BELIEVE in our beliefs in the same 
way. We contextualize them differently. We understand, we hold them differently. And 
that does not always happens at security conferences where the rhetoric reinforces the 
narrative that includes sales pitches, marketing brochures, and both bunnies handing out 
chocolates.  
Cultural studies of media, to which I will refer a little, are about beliefs, the management 
of perception in the mind of society. One might say that the world divides into people 
who believe in their beliefs in a primary naive way – and those who don’t. 
Security in the real world is about – what works? Why do we bow at the Zen Center? a 
monk asked his audience. We bow because things seem to work better when we bow 
That is practical spirituality, and applies to work and life alike. What are those things, the 
doing of which makes things work better, when we do them? 
So this is an attempt to put what we hear at conferences - like this one - into context, the 
social, economic, or political dimensions of security and how those affect our behavior 
7 
and what we say. We may still make the same claims, but ... we will not believe in them 
in the same way. We will hear ourselves say them and quietly critique our own blather, if 
only inside our heads.. 
There is a way to hold all of this and not get all arrogant, superior, or smarmy about it. 
We are all merely human. No one has the high moral ground. We all swim in the same 
water, as Jake Gittes said in “Chinatown. ”Our real challenge is to be willing to be 
human, to be enthusiastically and robustly human,  not less than human.  
Not the Borg. 
THE DARK SIDE  
James Baldwin said, “The price one pays for pursuing any profession or calling is an 
intimate knowledge of its ugly side.”  
If we do not know that ugly side, we do not know the profession - or ourselves. The price 
we pay for self-awareness is an intimate knowledge of our ugly sides, too. So another 
title for this talk is: know yourself.  
One place to look is the exploration of deep politics, e.g. Peter Dale Scott, “ Deep 
Politics and the Death of JFK.” There is an important “distinction between traditional 
conspiracy theory, conscious secret collaborations toward shared ends, and deep political 
analysis, the study of all those practices and arrangements, deliberate or not, which are 
usually repressed rather than acknowledged. In the latter, there is an open system with 
divergent power centers and goals, not a single objective or control point.” 
But more than that, a deep political system or process habitually resorts to decision-
making and enforcement procedures outside as well as inside those publicly sanctioned 
by law and society. They are “covert and suppressed, outside general awareness as 
well as outside acknowledged political processes.” 
An example: criminal structures are often tolerated by police because of their usefulness 
for informing on lesser criminals. See e.g. the Whitey Bulger file.  The same is true re: 
the intelligence community. In Chicago, e.g., there is a police-criminal symbiosis and the 
mob controls more than the police department it has corrupted. It controls civic life, its 
economic political and social underpinnings. Its depth and persistence creates the frame.  
Next: as a result of morphing geopolitical structures into what we now call meta-national 
stage-managed globalism, Competitive Intelligence and “economic patriotism” are 
indistinguishable from state-based intelligence operations. When Jan Hering moved from 
the CIA to Motorola, it was a marker – first of what trans-nationals had become, then 
what meta-nationals would become.

I keynoted twice for a Microsoft Israel conference and shared the platform with Steve 
Ballmer. My job was to enhance his credibility when he spoke about taking security 
seriously, at long last, because the market and changing global conditions required it. 
Now, Bill Gates is no worse than Larry Ellison or Scott McNealy or Steve Jobs – to 
achieve the positions of any of them, you had better be a robber baron and use all means 
necessary to secure intellectual property from taking the property to taking the human 
head that knows the details, using the whole repertoire of techniques used by the IC
