of a workflow we can reduce its cost or execution time.
III.QOSMINING
In this section we focus on describing a new method that
can be used by organizations to apply data mining
algorithms to historical data and predict QoS for their
running workflow instances. The method presented in this Fig. 2. Path mining

the method described in [4]. The method is composed of To perform path mining, current workflow logs need to

following subsections. the type of the input parameters passed to activities and the
output parameters received from activities. The values of
inputs/outputs are generated at runtime during the
execution of workflow instances. Table 1 shows an
extended workflow log which accommodates input/output
values of activity parameters that have been generated at
runtime. Each ‘Parameter/Value’ entry as a type, a
parameter name, and a value (for example, string loan-
type=”car-loan”).
