**Title: Workflow Quality of Service Management Using Data Mining Techniques**

**Author: Jorge Cardoso**

**Abstract:**
Organizations have long recognized the importance of Quality of Service (QoS) for maintaining competitiveness. Workflow systems are a suitable solution for managing the QoS of processes and workflows. Effective QoS management in workflows can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce internal costs, and increase the value of services. This paper introduces a novel method that leverages data mining techniques to predict the QoS of running workflow instances. Our method, which builds on previous work in Business Process Intelligence (BPI), has been validated through experimentation with various data mining algorithms. The results demonstrate the potential for more accurate and flexible QoS predictions.

### I. Introduction
The global economy demands advanced information systems. Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) provide the necessary infrastructure to define and manage business processes. Workflow Management Systems (WfMS), a subset of BPMS, have become a critical competitive factor for many organizations, enabling them to streamline and automate business processes, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs.

One key requirement for BPMS and WfMS is the ability to manage the QoS of processes and workflows. Ignoring QoS during the design and composition of workflows can lead to suboptimal performance. Proper QoS control ensures the creation of high-quality products and services, meeting customer expectations and achieving satisfaction. In this context, QoS encompasses factors such as response time, reliability, and cost.

A significant aspect of QoS management is the prediction of QoS for workflows. Several approaches, including statistical algorithms, simulations, and data mining-based methods, have been proposed for this purpose. This paper focuses on the latter approach, which uses data mining to predict QoS. This method has gained attention and is associated with the emerging field of Business Process Intelligence (BPI).

### II. Motivation
Many organizations are adopting workflow management systems to support their business processes. However, current systems often lack effective QoS management, particularly for parameters such as delivery deadlines, reliability, and cost. For example, when a workflow is initiated to deliver a service, it would be beneficial for the organization to predict the completion time and associated costs. 

Workflows are non-deterministic and concurrent, making QoS prediction challenging. A single workflow schema can generate multiple instances, each potentially invoking a different subset of activities. Even if the execution times and costs of individual activities were static, the overall QoS of a workflow instance would vary based on the specific activities invoked at runtime.

Predicting QoS offers several advantages:
- **Monitoring and Prediction:** Organizations can monitor and predict QoS at any point during the workflow lifecycle.
- **Compliance Assurance:** Workflows must be continuously monitored to ensure they meet initial QoS requirements and objectives.
- **Adaptation Strategies:** If a running workflow is not meeting QoS requirements, adaptation strategies can be triggered to modify the workflow structure, thereby reducing costs or execution time.

### III. QoS Mining Method
This section describes a new method for predicting QoS using data mining algorithms. Our method differs significantly from previous approaches and consists of three distinct phases:

1. **Path Mining:**
   - **Objective:** Predict the path that will be followed by workflow instances at runtime.
   - **Process:** Analyze the workflow log and apply data mining algorithms to identify likely paths.
   - **Data Requirements:** Extend the workflow logs to include input/output parameter values and path information.
   - **Example:** In a simple workflow, path mining can predict the probability of different paths being followed, each with a different set of activities.

2. **QoS Activity Model Construction:**
   - **Objective:** Build a QoS model for each activity that may be invoked.
   - **Process:** Use historical data to construct a QoS activity model that includes runtime behavior, such as duration and cost.
   - **Technique:** Similar to operational profiling, where the input space is partitioned into domains, and each input is associated with a probability.
   - **Model Update:** QoS models are constructed at design time and re-computed as needed.

3. **Workflow QoS Estimation:**
   - **Objective:** Estimate the overall QoS of a workflow based on the predicted path and QoS activity models.
   - **Process:** Use reduction rules to compute the QoS of the workflow.
   - **Validation:** Validate the method through experimentation with various data mining algorithms.

### V. Conclusions
In conclusion, this paper presents a novel method for predicting the QoS of running workflow instances using data mining techniques. The method, which builds on previous work in BPI, has been validated through experimentation and shows promise for more accurate and flexible QoS predictions. Future work will focus on further refining the method and exploring its application in real-world scenarios.
