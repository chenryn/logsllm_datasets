Hello,
Following #21409, I think it would be very more user-friendly to enable
passing parameters as objects to Router::generate().  
Indeed, the user is used to get objects from parameters in the controller
using explicit or implicit param converters, so it would be nice to be able to
pass these very same objects to generate routes.  
It should be possible insofar the task of the Router is exactly managing
controller arguments for making routes.
