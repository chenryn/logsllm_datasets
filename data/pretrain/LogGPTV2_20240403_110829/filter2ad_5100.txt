ABSTRACT
Cloud computing is a dominant trend in computing for the
foreseeable future; e.g., major cloud operators are now es-
timated to house over a million machines each and to host
substantial (and growing) fractions of our IT and web in-
frastructure. CCSW is a forum for bringing together re-
searchers and practitioners to discuss the implications of this
trend to the security of cloud operators, tenants, and the
larger Internet community. CCSW welcomes submissions
on new threats, countermeasures, and opportunities brought
about by the move to cloud computing, with a preference for
unconventional approaches, as well as measurement studies
and case studies that shed light on the security implications
of clouds.
• cost and usability models and their interaction with
cloud security
• scalability of secure clouds
• trusted computing technology and clouds
• analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud
protection
• network security (DoS, IDS, etc.) mechanisms for clouds
• security for cloud programming models
CCSW is also receptive to novel paradigms and controversial
ideas that are not on the above list.

1. TOPICAL COVERAGE
ACM CCSW is a forum for presenting novel research or
empirical studies from academia, industry, and government
on all theoretical and practical aspects of security, privacy,
and data protection in cloud scenarios. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:
• secure cloud resource virtualization
• secure data management outsourcing
• practical privacy and integrity mechanisms for out-
sourcing
• cloud-centric threat models
• secure outsourced computation
• remote attestation mechanisms in clouds
• sandboxing and VM-based enforcement
• trust and policy management in clouds
• secure identity management mechanisms
• cloud-aware web service security paradigms and mech-
anisms
• cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mecha-
nisms
• business and security risk models for clouds

3. PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS
Elli Androulaki is a Research Staﬀ Member at IBM Re-
search – Zurich, where she is leading a team focusing on
Hyperledger-fabric security. During her tenure at IBM Re-
search, Dr. Androulaki has performed applied security re-
search and development, contributing to multiple products
in the IBM Enterprise Block and File Storage portfolio.
Before joining IBM Research, Dr. Androulaki worked at
the Systems Security group at ETH Zurich as a researcher.
1882She holds a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineer-
ing from the National Technical University of Athens with
distinction and received her M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in
Computer Science from Columbia University, New York.
Her research interests involve privacy, cloud security, and
blockchain security.
Michael K. Reiter is the Lawrence M. Slifkin Distinguished
Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His previous
positions include Professor of ECE and CS at Carnegie Mel-
lon University and Director of Secure Systems Research at
Bell Laboratories. His research interests include all aspects
of computer security and distributed computing, and he has
been named an ACM Fellow and an IEEE Fellow for his con-
tributions to these areas. He holds a B.S. degree in Math-
ematical Sciences from the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell Uni-
versity.
