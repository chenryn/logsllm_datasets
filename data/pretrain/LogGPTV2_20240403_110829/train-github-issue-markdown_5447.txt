**Current behavior**  
When navigating forward and then back, the scroll position is lost.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
When navigating on an extensive list of items, the user scrolls down the list
and click on some item. The app activates the next route/component which shows
the product details. If the user decides do navigate back, the page does not
scroll to the previous point.
**Reproduction of the problem**
Live example: http://plnkr.co/edit/vUROPirs5tjklyBw6t4H?p=preview  
step 1 - first, adjust browser zoom until heroes from the hero list disappear  
step 2 - scroll down to the end of the page  
step 3 - click on "RubberMan"  
step 4 - click on the back button either on the browser or the component  
step 5 - the page is not scrolled to the same position of stop 2
**What is the expected behavior?**  
The browser should scroll to the previous position like it happens in any non-
single page application.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
It should be considered a bug that can reduce the level of the user
experience.
