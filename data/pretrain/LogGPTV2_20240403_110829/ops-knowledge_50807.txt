User: I am new to Eclipse & PyDev (on Ubuntu 13.04) and want to try Python3.3 programming.
But I cannot choose python3.3 iterpreter, - I try to choose it in usr\lib\python3.3 , but:
- when I try to choose PYTHONPATH by clicking "New folder" - window doesn't open (I can do it onl after choosing auto-config, which will add python2.7 pates);
- I don't know the file in usr\lib\python3.3, which I need to choose, as python3.3 interpreter (auto-config returns me only 2.7 objects).
Can you advice me how to choose python3.3 interpreter (maybe the main is the file\path I need to choose in " usr\lib\python3.3" as interpreter file - in windows Eclipse I see python3.3.exe, - I need to find its equal in Ubuntu I think)?
Thanks!
Assistant: Use the auto-config option. It will automatically find the libraries.
