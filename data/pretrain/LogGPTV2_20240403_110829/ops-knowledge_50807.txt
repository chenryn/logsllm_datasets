I am new to using Eclipse and PyDev on Ubuntu 13.04 and would like to start programming with Python 3.3. However, I am encountering difficulties in setting up the Python 3.3 interpreter.

When I attempt to select the Python 3.3 interpreter from `/usr/lib/python3.3`, I face the following issues:
- When I try to add the PYTHONPATH by clicking "New folder," the window does not open. This only works after I use the auto-configuration option, which adds paths for Python 2.7.
- I am unsure which specific file in `/usr/lib/python3.3` I need to select as the Python 3.3 interpreter. The auto-configuration only returns options for Python 2.7.

Could you please advise me on how to correctly set up the Python 3.3 interpreter? Specifically, I need to know the correct file or path to choose in `/usr/lib/python3.3` as the interpreter. In Windows, I see `python3.3.exe`, so I assume there should be an equivalent in Ubuntu.

Thank you!

**Assistant:**

To set up the Python 3.3 interpreter in Eclipse with PyDev, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Python 3.3 Executable:**
   - On Ubuntu, the Python 3.3 executable is typically located at `/usr/bin/python3.3`.

2. **Configure the Interpreter in PyDev:**
   - Open Eclipse and go to `Window > Preferences`.
   - Navigate to `PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter`.
   - Click on the `New...` button to add a new interpreter.
   - In the `Interpreter Name` field, enter a name for your Python 3.3 interpreter (e.g., "Python 3.3").
   - In the `Interpreter Executable` field, browse to `/usr/bin/python3.3` and select it.
   - Click `OK` to save the interpreter configuration.

3. **Set Up the PYTHONPATH:**
   - After adding the interpreter, you can manually add the necessary libraries to the PYTHONPATH.
   - Go to `PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter` again.
   - Select the Python 3.3 interpreter you just added.
   - Click on the `Libraries` tab.
   - Click `Add Folder` and browse to `/usr/lib/python3.3` to add the standard library.
   - You can also add any additional site-packages or custom libraries if needed.

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   - Click `Apply and Close` to save your changes.
   - Create a new Python project and select the Python 3.3 interpreter to ensure everything is set up correctly.

Using the auto-configuration option may not always find the correct interpreter, especially if multiple versions of Python are installed. Manually specifying the interpreter and its libraries ensures that you are using the correct version.

If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for more assistance.
