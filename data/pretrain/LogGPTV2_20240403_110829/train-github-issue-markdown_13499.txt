Hi folks,  
Wondering if someone can please help with this import error on a fresh
install.
Background: Recently started a new conda environment with a couple of basics
like jupyter, numpy, scipy. I'm using MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4, and python3.7
The specific error is:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
     in 
    ----> 1 from jax import vmap # for auto-vectorizing functions
          2 from functools import partial # for use with vmap
          3 from jax import jit # for compiling functions for speedup
          4 from jax import random # stax initialization uses jax.random
          5 from jax.experimental import stax # neural network library
...

    ImportError: dlopen(/Users/lmar3213/miniconda3/envs/lew_jax/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jaxlib/xla_extension.so, 2): Symbol not found: ____chkstk_darwin
      Referenced from: /Users/lmar3213/miniconda3/envs/lew_jax/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jaxlib/xla_extension.so (which was built for Mac OS X 10.15)
      Expected in: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
     in /Users/lmar3213/miniconda3/envs/lew_jax/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jaxlib/xla_extension.so
To install, I ran as per the installation instructions i.e. `pip install
--upgrade pip` which was already up to date, and then `pip install --upgrade
jax jaxlib` which installed happily.
The only clue I have as to understanding the error is that it mentions
`xla_extension.so` was built for mac OS X 10.15 but Im on 10.13. Any help is
appreciated! Thankyou!
