User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows a series of data TLB error interrupts occurring over the course of a day. It begins with the kernel generating core.8280 and core.12357, followed by a series of 15 data TLB error interrupts occurring at regular intervals.
