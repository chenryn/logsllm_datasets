ently few of them actually chose stories, despite our
suggestion to do so. Nearly 50% of Story users re-
ported choosing no story whatsoever in their exit
surveys. Rather, these users employed a variety of
alternative strategies, such as picking four pleasing
pictures and then trying to memorize the order in
which they picked them. Not surprisingly, this con-
tributed very signiﬁcantly to incorrect password en-
tries due to misordering their selections. For exam-
ple, of the 236 incorrect password entries in Story,
over 75% of them consisted of the correct images se-
lected in an incorrect order. This is also supported
anecdotally by several of the exit surveys:
“I had no problem remembering the four
pictures, but
the
original order.”
I could not remember
“No story, though having one may have helped
to remember the order of the pictures better.”
“...
but the third try I found a sequence
that I could remember. ﬁsh-woman-girl-corn,
I would screw up the ﬁsh and corn order 50%
of the time, but I knew they were the pic-
tures.”
As such, it seems advisable in constructing graphical
password schemes to avoid having users remember
an ordering of images. For example, we expect that
a selection of k images, each from a distinct set of
n images (as in the Face scheme, though with im-
age categories not necessarily of only persons), will
generally be more memorable than an ordered se-
lection of k images from one set. If a scheme does

rely on users remembering an ordering, then the im-
portance of the story should be reiterated to users,
since if the sequence of images has some semantic
meaning then it is more likely that the password
is memorable (assuming that the sequences are not
too long [21]).
6 Conclusion
The graphical password schemes we considered in
this study have the property that the space of pass-
words can be exhaustively searched in short order
if an oﬄine search is possible. So, any use of these
schemes requires that guesses be mediated and con-
ﬁrmed by a trusted online system. In such scenarios,
we believe that our study is the ﬁrst to quantify fac-
tors relevant to the security of user-chosen graphical
passwords. In particular, our study advises against
the use of a PassfacesTM-like system that permits
user choice of the password, without some means to
mitigate the dramatic eﬀects of attraction and race
that our study quantiﬁes. As already demonstrated,
for certain populations of users, no imposed limit
on the number of incorrect password guesses would
suﬃce to render the system adequately secure since,
e.g., 10% of the passwords of males could have been
guessed by merely two guesses.
Alternatives for mitigating this threat are to pro-
hibit or limit user choice of passwords, to educate
users on better approaches to select passwords, or to
select images less prone to these types of biases. The
ﬁrst two are approaches initially attempted in the
context of text passwords, and that have appeared
in some graphical password schemes, as well. The
Story scheme is one example of the third strategy
(as is [4]), and our study indicates that password se-
lection in this scheme is suﬃciently free from bias to
suggest that reasonable limits could be imposed on
password guesses to render the scheme secure. For
example, the worst 10% of passwords in the Story
scheme for the most predictable population (Asian
males) still required twenty guesses to break, sug-
gesting a limit of ﬁve incorrect password guesses
might be reasonable, provided that some user ed-
ucation is also performed.
The relative strength of the Story scheme must be
balanced against what appears to be some diﬃculty
of memorability for users who eschew the advice of
using a story to guide their image selection. An al-
ternative (besides better user education) is to per-
mit unordered selection of images from a larger set
(c.f., [4, 7]). However, we believe that further, more
sizeable studies must be performed in order to con-
ﬁrm the usability and security of these approaches.

1For a random variable X taking on values in X , if G(X)
denotes its guessing entropy and H(X) denotes its Shannon
entropy, then it is known that G(X) ≥ 2H(X)−2 + 1 [18] and
that H(X) ≥ 2 log |X|
|X|−1 (G(X) − 1) [19].
