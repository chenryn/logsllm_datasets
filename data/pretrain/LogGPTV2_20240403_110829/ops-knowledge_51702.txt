User: What are the three current mainstream cloud computing deployment models listed?
Assistant: 1. Public cloud deployment mode: refers to the cloud computing environment shared by multiple users provided by cloud service providers (such as Alibaba Cloud, AWS, etc.). This deployment mode has the advantages of rapid deployment, elastic expansion, and free trial, and is suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises or individual users. 2. Private cloud deployment mode: refers to the cloud computing environment built and managed by the enterprise itself. Data and applications can only be used by internal personnel, with a high degree of security and control. This deployment model is suitable for large enterprises and government agencies. 3. Hybrid cloud deployment mode: refers to the combination of public cloud and private cloud, so that enterprises can flexibly choose which cloud environment to use according to business needs. This deployment mode highlights elasticity and scalability, which can help enterprises better respond to business changes.
