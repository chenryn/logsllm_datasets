ABSTRACT
Designing a fallback authentication mechanism that is both memo-
rable and strong is a challenging problem because of the trade-off
between usability and security. Security questions are popularly
used as a fallback authentication method for password recovery.
However, they are prone to guessing attacks by users’ acquain-
tances and may be hard to recall. To overcome these limitations, we
present PassTag, a hybrid password scheme that takes advantage
of both graphical and textual password authentication methods.
PassTag combines a user-provided image and a short personalized
text description of the image, imagetag, as an authentication secret.
Furthermore, PassTag incorporates decoy images to make it diffi-
cult to guess the user-provided pictures. We conducted three user
studies with 161 participants for up to three months to evaluate the
performance of PassTag against security questions. The evaluation
results demonstrate that PassTag is significantly stronger against
close adversaries and highly memorable (92.6%–95.0%) after one,
two, and three months, respectively. Our longitudinal study results
show PassTag is a promising alternative for fallback authentication.

1 INTRODUCTION
The increasing number of passwords that users have to remem-
ber and their complicated password composition policies make it
challenging for people to remember their passwords [36]. A recent
study [16] demonstrated that 45% of participants experienced at
least one account lockout in a year. When users are unable to recall
their passwords, fallback authentication schemes are required for
users to regain control of their accounts. Communication-based
password resets, or security questions are the most common ap-
proaches for fallback authentication. Communication-based pass-
word resets such as by email or mobile phone work well, but they
may not be appropriate in certain situations [18] (e.g., when users
lost the password for the email service itself). Hence, security ques-
tions have been popularly used as an alternative that takes advan-
tage of users’ personal information, but they are not easy to achieve
both in terms of security and usability [33, 35].
To overcome the limitations of existing fallback authentication
mechanisms, we propose a novel fallback authentication method
called PassTag (see Fig. 1) based on picture superiority effect1 [29]
and levels-of-processing effect2 [6]. Our goal is to strengthen fall-
back authentication systems by taking advantage of both graphical
and textual password authentication methods. We use user-chosen

memorability of textual passwords by creating an additional re-
trieval path to recall the textual passwords. Users will be able to
remember the image secrets more easily without much practice or
reinforcement than text passwords due to the picture superiority
effect. At the same time, levels-of-processing effect would help users
recall their user-provided image-tag secrets (personalized, unique,
memorable, and difficult-to-guess tagging for their own images)
using the images as cues. Moreover, user-provided image secrets
can also be used as an additional security barrier to strengthen
the security of PassTag, as it forces attackers to correctly choose
the user-provided image secrets followed by the user-provided
image-tag secrets.
While security questions generally suffer from close adversary at-
tacks (e.g., friends, colleagues, family members, or acquaintances) [17,
34], PassTag was designed to make it difficult from such attacks by
employing different security mechanisms in PassTag design. We
specifically introduce the idea of generating a set of decoy images
that share a common theme with user-provided image secrets so
that even close adversaries cannot easily guess the victim’s user-
provided image secrets. In addition, we provide defense mechanisms
against sophisticated human attackers as well as automated ma-
chine learning-based attacks and demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1) We explore how to construct images as gadgets or primitives
not only to be used as passwords but also as cues to help recall
textual passwords and discuss its security and memorability.
2) We design our graphical-textual hybrid fallback authentication
system, PassTag, to enable such concepts, whilst simultaneously
generating decoy images using adversarial samples similar to the
user-provided images to guarantee that the images can be used
as memory cues for legitimate users but cannot be leveraged by
attackers to guess textual passwords.
3) We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of PassTag to
evaluate the security and usability of PassTag. We conduct three
user studies with 161 participants and find that the secrets in
PassTag are significantly more memorable and resilient to close
adversaries than security questions.
Our IRB-approved user studies show that PassTag achieves (92.6%
– 95.0%) recall rates, which are similar or higher than other fallback
authentication systems [18, 19, 22, 35], with an average of (52.3–
53.9 seconds) authentication time. In addition, we analyzed the
correlation between each user’s provided images and their corre-
sponding textual image-tags using various machine learning APIs
and found that users did not make guessable or obvious choices for
their respected images and texts, which show that PassTag can be
robust against different types of attacks. Based on these findings,
we believe that PassTag can be used as a viable alternative for fall-
back authentication, striking a good balance between security and
privacy.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews
related works. Section 3 describes the overall design of the user-
chosen graphical-text hybrid fallback authentication system. Sec-
tion 4 highlights the possible attack models for our system. Section 5
to Section 11 discuss the user-studies and provides the results. Sec-
tion 12 offers discussion and Section 13 conclusion.
2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we present prior research that is directly relevant to
fallback authentication mechanisms as well as textual and graphical
passwords.
Fallback Authentication: Fallback authentication usually con-
sists of two stages. In the first stage, users have to provide various in-
formation, such as email addresses, phone numbers or choose secu-
rity questions and answers to the corresponding security questions.
This information is used in the second stage to retrieve or reset for-
gotten passwords. In particular, communication-based multi-factor
password resets relying on email and mobile phone are often used
for fallback authentication. This approach works well, but may not
be appropriate in certain situations [18] (e.g., when users lose the
password for the email service itself or do not have access to their
mobile phone). Garfinkel [11] identified that the email accounts
used for fallback authentication can become a single point of failure
or may be out of date and not be accessible anymore. Additionally,
mobile phone numbers could sometimes be sensitive information
that not every user would be comfortable sharing with their service
providers [15]. Security questions are also popularly used as an
alternative for communication-based password reset [10] due to
the fact that security questions are basically a knowledge-based
user authentication without requiring any communication with
other component (e.g., server). Users have to answer a number of
questions, which have to be recalled during fallback authentica-
tion. Most security questions are predefined by the service and are
based on users’ personal information (e.g. “What is your mother’s
maiden name?”). However, several previous studies have showed
that security questions are neither proficient in usability nor secu-
rity [14, 17, 21, 22].
Schechter et al. [35] evaluated security questions in popular
webmail providers such as AOL, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. Ac-
cording to their user study results, participants’ acquaintances were
able to guess 17% of the participants’ answers within 5 guesses,
demonstrating that personal knowledge questions (e.g., names of
relatives, names of schools attended) are vulnerable to close adver-
saries. Moreover, 20% of the participants in the user study did not
remember their answers within six months. To overcome the limi-
tations of traditional security questions, Hang et al. [18] proposed
dynamic security questions which were generated using mobile
phone usage behavior (e.g., calls, text messages or app usage) of
its users. However, it would be challenging to generate dynamic
security questions that are sufficiently secure and usable. Security
questions-based authentication schemes are inherently vulnerable
to close adversaries. To overcome this security weakness, PassTag is
designed to be secure against close adversaries by using decoy im-
ages, which are similar to the user-provided image secrets, in order
to introduce confusions to attackers carrying out educated guessing
attacks. In this work, we compare our approach with security ques-
tions as a baseline because it is a fallback authentication system
that is widely utilized and well studied.
Cognitive Effects on Authentication: Humans have an ex-
ceptional ability to recognize images previously seen, even when
the images are viewed very briefly due to the picture superiority
effect [1]. Picture superiority effect refers to the phenomenon that
for the human brain, recognition is an easier memory task than

formation as compared to textual information [7]. The most widely
recognized explanation for the picture superiority effect is the dual-
coding theory [30]. According to the dual-coding theory, graphical
images are encoded in the human brain not only visually, but the
images are also converted into a verbal form and remembered se-
mantically. Biddle et al. [3] leveraged this phenomenon of human
memory more effectively retrieving images than textual description
to develop various recognition-based graphical passwords schemes.
We explore and incorporate these effects into PassTag ’s system
design.
In addition, Craik et al. studied how information associated with
a stimuli is longer-lasting due to the levels-of-processing effect [6].
Levels-of-processing effect refers to the phenomenon that as number
of connections between information increases, it produces more
elaborate, longer-lasting, and stronger memory traces. Increasing
the levels of memory establishes a ceiling of potential memory
performance, and retrieval cues determine the extent to which that
potential is utilized [28]. Levels-of-processing effect can be evident by
observing how textual information is easier to recall for the human
brain when associated with pictorial information than recalling text
without any illustration [32]. Vu et al. [43] showed that increased
depth of processing increases password recall. The improvement
in recall is due to the amount of connections between memorable
information, which has the possibility to create more retrieval paths
for recalling the information.
Graphical-Textual Hybrid Passwords: Stubblefield and Si-
mon [37] introduced a scheme called Inkblot using images as a
cue for text password entry, where users are presented with a series
of computer-generated “inkblots” and asked to type the first and
last letter of the word or phrase that best describes each inkblot.
These letter pairs are used as the password during log-in with pre-
sented inkblots as cues to remember the characters. GridWord [2] is
another hybrid scheme where users select a set of three words. The
system stores an one-to-one mapping of the words to cells on a 2D
grid. During authentication, users enter their password by either
selecting the three grid cells or the three words. GeoPassNotes [26]
is an extension of the GeoPass [40], where users create a password
by first selecting a location on the map as and then creating an
annotation. For a log-in to be successful, both the same location and
annotation must be re-entered. Macrae et al. [26] found GeoPass-
Notes to be highly memorable and the addition of annotations
increased security with minimal usability impact.
In Deja’ Vu [8], users select and memorize a subset of “random
art” images from a large sample for their defined portfolio. For
authentication, users must recognize images belonging to their
pre-defined portfolio from a set of decoy images. In the test system,
a screen of 25 images was displayed, in which 5 of the images
was selected by the users for their portfolio. Users must correctly
identify all images from their portfolio distinguishing that from the
decoy images. Random art images are used to make it more difficult
for users to write down their password or share it with others by
describing their images. Marasim [23] is a jigsaw-based password
scheme where users must recognize system-generated images that
represent tags, which the users labeled from their user-submitted
image during password creation. During password creation, users
create textual tags for a image of their choice, and four random
images are returned by Google for each textual tag. Users then
choose one image per tag as their password. At the time of log-in
a challenge set of 25 images are randomly placed and users must
identify their images by entering the corresponding number on the
images. Oorschot and Wan [42] proposed TwoStep to combine a
