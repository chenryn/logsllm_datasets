or CDS record in one of its customers’ domains, it authenticates the
record and then updates the DS record in the registry.8 Once the old
DS record is replaced with new one, the customer can remove the
5DNSKEYs for a domain could be delivered out-of-band even
though the domain does not have a DS record, enabling an RRSIG
to be validated by the DNSKEYs. However this is not the intended
mechanism for deployment of DNSSEC.
6An anecdotal example is that the DS record for isoc.org was
found to be incorrect at the 38’th ICANN meeting in 2010 due to a
transcription error made when the DS record was manually entered
while dictated over a phone. This was discovered shortly before
the press conference announcing the ISOC (The Internet Society)
DNSSEC deployment by one of our authors and fixed immediately.
7Since the DS record can be generated using the CDNSKEY, pub-
lishing both a CDS and CDNSKEY is redundant but not incorrect.
8The operational methods for the registry to notice the CDNSKEY
and CDS record may differ; the registry can use tools that periodically
check each of its customers’ domains to see if they have a CDS and
CDNSKEY record, or it can provide a web interface for the customer
to signal the parent zone to fetch the records.
Figure 2: Steps in the process for inserting a DS record into the
registry when the DNS operator is (1) a registrar, (2) a reseller,
(3) the owner, and (4) a third-party. In each case, it is the DNS
operator who actually generates the DS record; it then has to
be handed off (potentially up to three times) to make it to the
registry. Not shown is the case where a customer buys a domain
from a reseller and uses a third-party DNS operator (adding yet
another handoff).
CDNSKEY and CDS records from their zone configuration settings.9
Unfortunately, CDS and CDNSKEY have thus far seen very little adop-
tion by registries, leaving us with the manual processes described
above.
Third-party DNS operators Recently, we have observed the
growth in popularity of organizations that provide management of
DNS records, but do not serve as registrars; we refer to these organi-
zations as third-party DNS operators. These organizations serve as
authoritative nameservers for customers, manage DNS records, and
often provide security services such as distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) prevention. One prominent example of such a service is
Cloudflare. With a third-party DNS operator, properly deploying
DNSSEC is even more complicated, as it is the third-party who
generates DNSKEYs and RRSIGs. Specifically, if the registry does not
support CDS or CDNSKEY (which comprises all but one registrar at
the time of writing), the third-party DNS operator does not have the
authority to ask the registrar to upload a DS record; it must instead
ask the customer to relay a DS record to the registrar. As we will
see later in the paper, this convoluted process plays a role in why
DNSSEC adoption remains low.
As a summary, Figure 2 shows how the process for inserting
DS records into the registry varies when the DNS operator is the
registrar, a reseller, the owner, and a third-party.
3 RELATED WORK
In this section, we discuss studies of DNSSEC deployment and DNS
registrars.
DNSSEC deployment We first discuss related studies of DNSSEC
deployment, covering both server-side (DNSSEC-enabled domain)
and client-side (DNS resolver) studies.
Server-side support: DNSSEC has attracted much attention from
both research and industrial stakeholders. In early stage of deploy-
ment of DNSSEC, several studies measured the operational sta-
tus of DNSSEC [34, 35] or operational challenges for wide de-
ployments [48]. More recently, studies found that 89% of generic
TLDs (gTLDs) and 47% of country-code TLDs (ccTLDs) supported

the registry to remove the current DS record by setting the algorithm

DNSSEC in 2016 [40], and that most major DNS server software
supports DNSSEC [14] as well. Additionally, a number of free
tools exist to help system administrators properly deploy DNSSEC,
such as DNSSEC Debugger [11] and DNSViz [15]. Recent studies
have also found, however, that DNSSEC adoption for second-level
domains remains low. Our recent study [8] showed that DNSSEC
deployment is rare in the second-level domains (roughly 1% of .com,
.net and .org domains), but is growing. Some of the studies have
focused on the misconfigurations of DNSSEC: Adrichem et al. [43]
analyzed a sample of second-level domains and similarly found that
4% exhibited misconfigurations. Dai et al. [10] also found that 19%
of second-level domains from the Alexa Top-1M could not establish
a chain of trust from the root. One of the common causes was the
failure to upload DS records; nearly 30% of .com, .net, and .org
domains do not properly upload DS records even though they have
DNSKEYs and RRSIGs [8].
Our work complements these pieces of prior work, as they mea-
sured the current status of the low DNSSEC deployment. In contrast,
we focus primarily on why DNSSEC deployment remains so small
and why there are high levels of DNSSEC misconfiguration. Our ap-
proach is to purchase domains from popular registrars and resellers
and then examine the process of configuring DNSSEC for these
domains. We also use considerably broader datasets including all
second-level domains from three gTLDs (.com, .net, and .org) and
two ccTLDs (.nl and .se).
Client-side support: To measure client-side support for DNSSEC,
studies have used advertisements in embedded webpages to cause
clients to make DNS requests [4, 29, 40]; their results showed that
about 26% of clients use DNSSEC-validating resolvers, but they
retry querying to non-validating resolvers if validation fails (de-
feating the point of DNSSEC). Using a similar technique, Lian
et al. [29] showed that 1% of clients failed to resolve DNSSEC-
enabled domains at all, while only 3% of clients successfully de-
tected DNSSEC-signed domains with broken signatures. Finally,
we used the Luminati proxy network [7] to induce DNS requests;
we found that 83% of clients use a resolver that requests DNSSEC
records, but only 12% of them actually bother to validate the re-
sponse [8].
Registrars Another line of work has examined the role of reg-
istrars in the deployment of DNSSEC. Recent work has found
that many second-level domains with DNSKEYs fail to upload a DS
record [8, 43, 44], suggesting that certain registrars may incorrectly
deploy DNSSEC. Some studies focused on the process of enabling
DNSSEC. The Internet Society [22], for example, stressed the role
of registrars in enabling DNSSEC, publishing a list of registrars that
are known to support DNSSEC. The report by York [47] also pointed
out that the low DNSSEC adoption rate is due to its complexity, and
the most effective way to accelerate its deployment is to simplify the
process of signing a domain, such as enabling DNSSEC by default.
On the other hand, several studies examined ways to increase
DNSSEC deployment, primarily through financial incentives [9, 18–
20]. Collectively, they showed how financial incentives for a registrar
can lead to higher levels of DNSSEC adoption. Unfortunately, finan-
cial incentives are only offered by a small number of ccTLDs (e.g.,
.nl, .se, and .cz), and this approach has yet to expand to other
TLDs.

There are also several attempts to make it easier for third-party
DNS operators to use DNSSEC. For example, Cloudflare and CIRA,
the registry operator for .ca, are working on a draft standard [13,
27], which essentially would allow the third-party DNS operator to
identify the registrars and communicate with them directly to enable
or bootstrap DNSSEC using a REST-based [39] protocol (without
any effort from registrants).
4 DATASETS
In this section, we present the datasets that we use in this study and
briefly examine the overall support for DNSSEC to help motivate
the subsequent analysis.
4.1 TLD zone files
Our goal is to understand how different registrars have affected
DNSSEC’s deployment. To do so, we rely on scans from five TLDs,
provided by OpenINTEL [36, 45]: the .com, .net, and .org generic
TLDs and .se and .nl country-code TLDs. We choose .com, .net,
and .org because they are some of the largest TLDs, and .se and
.nl because they are TLDs that show some of the highest rates of
DNSSEC deployment [12].
Our dataset contains daily scans of all second-level domains in
these five TLDs. Because of the way the data was collected, our
datasets start at different times: .com, .net, and .org start on March
1st, 2015, .nl starts on February 9th, 2016, and .se starts on June
7th, 2016. However, all end on December 31st, 2016. Table 1 shows
a summary.
Each daily scan contains a number of pieces of information for
each second-level domain in the zone: First, each daily scan con-
tains the Nameserver (NS) record(s) for each domain, containing the
authoritative nameserver(s) of the DNS operator. Second, each scan
contains the Delegation Signer (DS) record for each domain, if it
exists. Third, each scan contains the DNSKEY and DNSKEY RRSIGs for
the domain, if any exist. Taken together, the scans represent one of
the most comprehensive sets of DNSSEC observations.

4.2
To understand how different registrars behave, we first need to know
who manages each domain. One possible option is to use WHOIS
data to obtain registrar information; however the WHOIS infras-
tructure is distributed across registrars and resellers, is heavily rate-
limited, and lacks a consistent schema [28]. Moreover, a domain
could be managed by a reseller, but the WHOIS information may be

Figure 3: Cumulative distribution of .com, .org, and .net do-
mains by DNS operators; shown are all, partially deployed, and
fully deployed domains. We can see that 26 DNS operators are
necessary to cover over 50% of all domains. However, only four
DNS operators are needed to cover 57% partially deployed do-
mains, and only two DNS operators cover 54% of fully deployed
domains.
served by its partner registrar; this would conflate the behavior of
the reseller and the registrar.
Instead, we rely on the authoritative nameserver for each domain
(from the NS record), which is present in our data sets, to indicate the
DNS operator. The identity of the authoritative nameserver serves
our purpose well, as the domain name of the authoritative name-
server typically identifies the organization that is actually managing
the name. Specifically, we group domains if they share the same
second-level domain in their NS records. For example, if two dif-
ferent domains have NS records of ns01.domaincontrol.com and
ns02.domaincontrol.com, we group these under the DNS operator
domaincontrol.com (owned by GoDaddy).
4.3 Overall DNSSEC support
We begin by quickly examining how DNSSEC is deployed across
different TLDs. Table 1 shows the number of domains in each of the
TLDs that we study as well as the percentage of domains that have
DNSKEYs; we can immediately observe that the overall DNSSEC
deployment rate in the three generic TLDs is quite low—in line with
recent studies [8]—but that the percentage is much higher in .nl and
.se. We explore this trend in more detail in the subsequent sections.
Next, we examine how the domains that attempt to deploy
DNSSEC are distributed across registrars. Recall that to correctly
deploy DNSSEC, a domain must (a) publish DNSKEYs and RRSIGs
for all records, and (b) must have a DS record in the TLD zone. Thus,
we examine how three subsets of the domains are distributed across
registrars: (1) all domains, (2) partially deployed domains, and (3)
fully deployed domains.
Figure 3 presents a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of
the number of all .com, .net, and .org domains per registrar from
the December 31, 2016 snapshot. We make two observations. First,
we observe that partially and fully deployed domains show a much
different distribution across registrars than the overall data set: 26
registrars are necessary to cover 50% of all domains, but only four
registrars are necessary to cover 50% of the partially deployed do-
mains, and only two registrars are necessary to cover 50% of the
fully deployed domains. Second, the small number of registrars that
host an outsized proportion of DNSSEC domains suggests that many

ployment for DNSSEC.
popular registrars fail to support DNSSEC. For example, the overlap
between the 25 most popular registrars overall, and the 25 most pop-
ular registrars among fully deployed domains is only three registrars,
which paints a bleak picture of DNSSEC support among registrars.
Hence, to better understand why and how DNSSEC is deployed, we
turn our attention to study each registrar’s DNSSEC deployment
policy and its impact.
5 POPULAR REGISTRARS
We begin by examining how the most popular DNS registrars support
DNSSEC. To do so, we register domains ourselves and attempt to
deploy DNSSEC, as well as look at all domains operated by the
registrar to look for patterns.
5.1 Methodology
To understand how different registrars support DNSSEC, we need to
register domains and try to deploy DNSSEC as a customer would.
We focus on the most popular 31 DNS operators that serves DNS
for the most domains across our datasets, which collectively cover
54.3% of .com, .net, and .org domains in the TLD zone files. For
each of these 31 DNS operators, we proceed as follows:
(1) We first check whether the DNS operator is a registrar. We
found nine are domain parking services10 and two are third-
party DNS operators. We do not study the domain parking
services further11. The two third-party DNS operators, DNS-
Pod and Cloudflare, are studied in Section 7. For the others,
we purchase a .com domain.
(2) Next, we examine whether our purchased domain supports
DNSSEC by default, or if DNSSEC is an opt-in feature. If
we are unable to find a way to do so, we email the registrar to
ask if they support DNSSEC.
10Domain parking services are services that hold a given domain,
but do not provide any services (e.g., a website). Often, such parking
services simply serve ads as a way to profit from parked domains.
11These DNS operators are parking services: Ename (1,604,676
domains), BuyDomains (1,190,973), SedoParking (1,186,838), Do-
mainNameSales (1,081,944), CashParking (1,012,114), HugeDo-
mains (807,607), ParkingCrew (660,081), RookMedia (619,254), as
well as the advertising domain ztomy.com (631,381 domains).
