User: How to detect and prevent the server from DDoS attack? Please provide commonly used defense methods and techniques, and explain the advantages, disadvantages and applicable scenarios of each method and technique.
Assistant: DDoS attack is a cyber attack designed to make a server unavailable or crash by flooding it with traffic and requests. Therefore, in order to detect and prevent servers from DDoS attacks, the following are commonly used defense methods and technologies: 1. Traffic monitoring Traffic monitoring can help administrators detect abnormal network traffic, so as to respond to DDoS attacks in time. The advantage of this method is that abnormal traffic can be detected quickly and actions can be taken quickly, but the disadvantage is that normal traffic may be falsely reported. 2. Firewall A firewall can filter out traffic from unknown sources, thereby preventing DDoS attacks. The advantage of this method is that it can filter out most malicious traffic, but the disadvantage is that it may filter out legitimate traffic. 3. CDN CDN is a global distributed network, which can help accelerate and distribute data on the server, thereby reducing the load and pressure on the server. The advantage of this method is that it can disperse a large amount of attack traffic, but the disadvantage is that it may affect the performance and speed of the website. 4. Reverse proxy The reverse proxy can forward the traffic to multiple servers, thereby dispersing the attack traffic, thereby reducing the load and pressure on the server. The advantage of this method is that it can disperse a large amount of attack traffic, but the disadvantage is that it may affect the performance and speed of the website. 5. Flow limiting and QoS By limiting the flow or QoS (Quality of Service) on the server, administrators can limit the flow and requests, thereby reducing the load and pressure on the server. The advantage of this method is that it can limit traffic and requests, but the disadvantage is that it may affect the performance and speed of the website. In general, the above methods and technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the applicable scenarios are also different. Therefore, administrators should choose appropriate defense methods and technologies according to the actual situation of the server, so as to protect the server from DDoS attacks.
