**Migrated issue, originally created by Adrian (@thiefmaster)**
I have the following code:
https://gist.github.com/ThiefMaster/9cea43683142912e5ffb0fa3b5d8d0a9
It fails with a circular dependency error even though there is only a change
to `p` (however, both `p` and `gal` show up in  
`sess.dirty` when I print it right before the commit, but `is_modified` only
returns True for `p`).
It also works fine if I uncomment the expire call - but of course that's an
awful workaround. `post_update=True` on the `gallery`  
relationship also does the job but it seems like an SQLAlchemy bug to me since
there's only one object with changes which can be flushed/committed just fine
if I do  
a manual expire...
