### VII. Discussion

#### Risk Mitigation for Disposable Email Addresses
Our study highlights several risky use cases associated with disposable email services. The primary source of risk is the public nature of these inboxes, which can be accessed by multiple users simultaneously (see §III-A). Randomly assigned addresses do not fully mitigate this issue, as they can still be accessed by different users at the same time. One potential countermeasure is to implement a sandbox using cookies. For instance, if a user is currently accessing an inbox, other users without the same cookie should be prevented from accessing it. The inbox would then become available again once the current session is closed.

If a disposable email service does not implement such a sandbox, it is essential that the service clearly informs users about the public nature of the inboxes and the specific expiration times for emails. Our findings indicate that some disposable email services retain emails for much longer than advertised, sometimes up to 30 days beyond the promised duration.

Users of disposable email services should proactively delete their emails whenever possible and avoid sharing personally identifiable information (PII) in both the temporary inbox and any accounts registered through the disposable email address. Due to the public nature of these services, accounts registered with disposable email addresses are vulnerable to hijacking through password resets. Future research could explore user perceptions of the benefits and risks of using disposable email services and identify any potential misunderstandings regarding their security.

#### Email Tracking and Countermeasures
The most straightforward way to prevent email tracking is to stop rendering emails in HTML (i.e., use plaintext emails) or block all outgoing requests not initiated by user clicks. However, this approach degrades the user experience, as images in the email (if not embedded) will not be displayed. To address this, Gmail has implemented a feature where the server fetches all images on behalf of the user, preventing trackers from collecting IP addresses. Nevertheless, trackers can still gather the following information: (1) the user opens the email, (2) the time of opening, and (3) the user's identifier (if included as a parameter in the tracking URL).

A more promising method is to perform targeted HTML filtering to remove tracking-related image tags. Since most tracking pixels are invisible, removing them would not significantly impact the user experience. This approach is similar to ad-blocking, where filters are used to detect and remove ads on websites. In addition to static HTML analysis, dynamic analysis is necessary to account for trackers that may falsely claim HTML size attributes or hide behind redirections.

#### Email Tracking Notification
For transparency, it is crucial to inform users when tracking is detected. Many websites are now required (e.g., by the EU Privacy Directive) to notify users when cookies are used for web tracking. More recently, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) prohibits online services from tracking users via email without explicit consent. However, there is no such privacy policy in the U.S. While legislation may take time, a more immediate solution is to rely on email services or clients to notify users of tracking.

#### A Comparison with Previous Research
Our work builds on a recent study that analyzed email tracking across 902 websites (12,618 emails) [17]. Our dataset is significantly larger, and while some of our results confirm previous observations—such as the widespread use of obfuscation and MD5 for encoding user identifiers—other findings differ. For example, doubleclick.net, ranked 1st in the previous study, is only 7th in our dataset based on unique sender domains (ranked 2nd based on email volume). list-manage.com, ranked 10th in the previous study, is the top third-party tracker in our analysis. These differences can be attributed to several factors: (1) our larger dataset (210,000+ sender domains vs. 902), (2) our broader coverage of website categories (over 100 vs. "Shopping" and "News"), and (3) our inclusion of various tracking methods (e.g., invisible or remote pixels) beyond just those containing explicit user identifiers.

### VIII. Limitations

#### Dataset Coverage
Our analysis primarily covers disposable email services with user-specified addresses (UA). Collecting data from randomly assigned addresses (RA) is more challenging. Using a small dataset from RA services (§III-A), we found that these addresses also contain account management emails, including 134 registration emails (11.7%), 44 password reset emails (3.9%), and 32 authentication emails (2.8%). The spam email ratio is lower in RA services (81.6%) compared to UA services (94%).

#### Representativeness
Our dataset is not representative of a typical user's inbox, limiting its use for assessing email tracking at an individual level. However, it provides valuable insights into tracking activities across a large number of online services (200K domains across 121 categories). Future work could involve user studies to evaluate tracking at the individual level.

#### Ethical Considerations
For ethical reasons, we did not manually analyze PII or backtrack accounts registered with disposable addresses. This limitation affects our ability to answer certain questions, such as confirming the validity of detected PII (assuming training accuracy transfers well to testing) and verifying the legitimacy of password reset emails.

#### Detection Methods
Our current detection methods have limitations. For example, trackers could use subdomain names instead of URL parameters to identify individual users or use font links instead of image links. We did not find such cases in our dataset. Additionally, our method cannot detect tracking URLs that use both large tracking images and random strings as user identifiers.

### IX. Related Work

#### Web Tracking and Email Tracking
Web tracking has been extensively studied over the past decade, with researchers analyzing third-party tracking across different websites and countries. Google is consistently identified as the top tracker, with 80% of Alexa's top 1 million websites hosting Google-owned trackers. Various tracking techniques, such as flash cookies, canvas fingerprinting, evercookies, and cookie syncing, have been examined. While adblockers help reduce tracking, anti-adblockers are becoming increasingly sophisticated.

#### Disposable Accounts and Phone-Verified Accounts
Previous research has explored disposable SMS services and the security risks associated with man-in-the-middle attacks. Studies have also investigated SMS spam and the re-registration of "retired" email addresses to hijack existing accounts. Other research has looked at how disposable SMS services are used to create phone-verified fake accounts in online services.

#### PII Leakage and Email Hijacking
Studies have examined PII leakage through various channels, including mobile network traffic, website contact forms, and cross-device tracking. Our work focuses on PII leakage during email tracking, providing new insights into the prevalence and methods of tracking.

### X. Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive measurement study of disposable email services, collecting a large dataset from 7 popular services (2.3 million emails sent by 210K domains). Our findings provide new insights into the uses and potential risks of disposable email services and the prevalence of email tracking across different online services. These results are valuable for developing more effective anti-tracking tools for email systems.

### Appendix – Obfuscated User Identifier
To detect obfuscated user identifiers (i.e., email addresses) in tracking URLs, we tested 31 different hash/encoding functions. If the link's parameters contain the "obfuscated version" of the receiver's email address, the image is considered a tracking pixel. We applied 31 hash/encoding functions to the receiver's email address to look for a match and also tested two-layer obfuscations by exhaustively applying two-function combinations, e.g., MD5(SHA1()). In total, we examined 992 obfuscated strings for each address.
