(ﬁrst-party tracking). Popular tracking domains also include
shopping websites and information technology websites.
VII. DISCUSSION
Risk Mitigation for Disposable Email Addresses.
Our
study reveals risky use cases of disposable email services. The
root source of risk is the public nature of the disposable email
inboxes. Randomly-assigned addresses cannot fully mitigate
this problem since multiple users can still access the same
address at the same time (see §III-A). One possible counter-
measure is to implement sandbox using cookies. For example,
if a current user is using the inbox, then other users who do not
possess the same cookie cannot access the same inbox. The
inbox will become available again once the current user closes
her session. If the disposable email service does not implement
sandbox, we believe it is necessary for the service to clearly
inform users about the public nature of the inbox. In addition,
it is also important for the service to clearly communicate
the email expiration time to users. Our results show that two
disposable email services host the emails much longer than
what they promised (e.g., 30 days of delay).
Users of disposable email services should proactively delete
their emails whenever possible. More importantly, users should
avoid revealing their PII in both the temporary inbox and in the
accounts they registered through the disposable email address.
Due to the public nature of the disposable email services,
accounts registered with disposable email addresses can be
easily hijacked through a password reset. A future direction is
to understand user perceptions towards the beneﬁts and risks
of using disposable email services and identify the potential
misunderstandings with respect to their security.
Email Tracking and Countermeasures.
The most
straightforward way to prevent email
tracking is to stop
rendering emails in HTML (i.e., plaintext email) or block all
the outgoing requests that are not initiated by user clicks. The
drawback, however, is a degradation of user experience since
the images in the email (if they are not embedded) cannot
be displayed. To address this problem, Gmail has a special
design where the Gmail server fetches all the images on behalf
of the users. In this way, the tracker cannot collect users’ IP
addresses. However, the tracker can still obtain the following
information: (1) the user indeed opens the email; (2) the time
of email opening; and (3) the user’s identiﬁer (if the identiﬁer
is a parameter of the tracking URL).
A more promising way is to perform targeted HTML
ﬁltering [17] to remove tracking related image tags. Since
most of tracking pixels are invisible, removing them would not
hurt the user experience. This is very similar to ad-blocking
where the ad-blocker construct ﬁltering rules to detect and
remove ads on websites. In addition to static HTML analysis,
we believe dynamic analysis is necessary since (1) trackers
may falsely claim the HTML size attributes, and (2) the real
trackers may hide behind the redirection.
Email Tracking Notiﬁcation.
For the sake of transparency,
it is necessary to inform users when tracking is detected.
Today, many websites are required (e.g., by EU Privacy
Directive) to display a notice to inform users when cookies
are used for web tracking. More recently, EU’s new GDPR
policy forbids online services from tracking users with emails
without unambiguous consent. However,
there is no such
privacy policy in the U.S.. While legislation may take a long
time, a more immediate solution is to rely on email services
or email clients to notify users.
A Comparison with Previous Research.
The most re-
lated work to ours is a recent study that analyzed emails
tracking of 902 websites (12,618 emails) [17]. In this work,
we collect a dataset that is larger by orders of magnitude.
Some of our results conﬁrm the observations of the small-
scale study. For example, we show that obfuscation is widely
used to encode user identiﬁers for tracking and MD5 is the

most commonly used method, both of which are consistent
with [17]. Interestingly, Some of our results are different, in
particular, the top third-party trackers (Table IX). For example,
doubleclick.net, which was ranked 1st by [17], is only
ranked 7th based on unique sender domains (ranked 2nd based
on email volume) in our dataset. list-manage.com was
ranked 10th by [17] but came to the top in our analysis. There
are a couple reasons that may contribute to the differences.
First, the previous work collected a small email dataset from
902 sender domains, while we collected emails from 210,000+
sender domains. Second, the previous study collected data
from “Shopping” and “News” categories, while our dataset
covers more than 100 website categories. Third, previous work
only considered tracking URLs that contain an explicit user
identiﬁer (i.e., email address), while we cover more tracking
methods (e.g., invisible or remote pixels).
VIII. LIMITATIONS
The ﬁrst limitation is that our analysis only covers dis-
posable email services with user-speciﬁed addresses (UA).
This is mainly due to the difﬁculty to obtain data from
randomly-assigned addresses (RA). Here, we use the small
dataset collected from RA services (§III-A) to provide some
contexts. Recall the dataset contains 1,431 messages from 5
RA services. After removing personal and non-English emails,
we apply our classiﬁer to the rest 1142 emails. We ﬁnd that
randomly-assigned addresses also contain account manage-
ment emails, including 134 registration emails (11.7%), 44
password reset emails (3.9%), and 32 authentication emails
(2.8%). We also notice that the spam email ratio is lower in RA
services (81.6%) than that of UA services (94%). Intuitively,
spammers often blindly send spam emails to addresses with
popular usernames.
The second limitation is that our dataset is not representative
with respect to a normal user inbox. Our measurement results
cannot be used to assess email tracking at a per-user level.
Instead, the main advantage of the dataset is that it contains
emails sent by a large number of online services (including the
top-ranked websites). This allows us to analyze email tracking
from the perspective of online services (200K domains across
121 categories). For future work, we can evaluate the user-
level tracking through user studies.
Third, for ethical considerations, we decided not to man-
ually analyze the PII or back-track the accounts registered
with the disposable addresses. This has limited our ability to
answer some of the questions. For example, in §IV-A, we did
not manually conﬁrm the validity of detected PII, assuming
the training accuracy transfers well to the testing. In §IV-C,
it is possible that spammers would use the email addresses
to register fake accounts in online services, but we cannot
conﬁrm. Similarly, for the password reset emails, it is possible
that the emails were triggered by malicious parties who were
trying to login other people’s accounts, or by the real owners
of the accounts who forgot the password.
Fourth, our email
incomplete.
Theoretically, it is possible for a tracker to use subdomain
tracking detection is still
names (instead of URL parameters) to identify individual
users, or use font links (instead of image links). However,
we did not ﬁnd such cases in our dataset. In addition, our
current method cannot detect tracking URLs that use both
large tracking images and random strings as user identiﬁers.
IX. RELATED WORK
Web Tracking and Email Tracking.
Web tracking has
been extensively studied by researchers in the past decade [15].
Researchers have analyzed third-party web tracking across
different websites [29] and countries [23]. Consistently, dif-
ferent studies have shown that Google is the top tracker
on the web [34], [43] where 80% of Alexa top 1 million
websites have Google-owned trackers [31]. Web tracking has
turned into a cat-and-mouse game. Researchers have studies
various tracking techniques such as ﬂash cookies [46], [12],
canvas ﬁngerprinting, evercookies, and cookie syncing [9],
[18]. While adblockers help to reduce tracking, anti-adblockers
are also increasingly sophisticated [59], [24], [36], [39].
Disposable Accounts and Phone Veriﬁed Accounts.
Pre-
vious work has studied disposable SMS services where public
phone numbers are offered to users for a temporary usage [41].
Researchers also studied the security risks of man-in-the-
middle attack [20], and use the collected messages to investi-
gate SMS spam [25], [37]. A recent work shows that “retired”
addresses from popular email services can be re-registered
to hijack existing accounts [21]. Other researchers looked in
how disposable SMS are used to create phone-veriﬁed fake
accounts in online services [50].
PII Leakage and Email Hijacking.
Previous works have
examined PII leakage under various channels [26], [27] such as
mobile network trafﬁc [42], [53], website contact forms [47],
and cross-device tracking [14]. Our work differs from previous
works with a focus on PII leakage during email tracking.
X. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we perform a ﬁrst measurement study on
disposable email services. We collect a large dataset from
7 popular disposable email services (2.3 million emails sent
by 210K domains), and provide new understandings of what
disposable email services are used for and the potential risks
of usage. In addition, we use the collected email dataset
to empirically analyze email tracking activities. Our results
provide new insights into the prevalence of tracking at different
online services and the evasive tracking methods used of
trackers. The results are valuable for developing more effective
anti-tracking tools for email systems.

APPENDIX – OBFUSCATED USER IDENTIFIER
To detect obfuscated user identiﬁers (i.e. email addresses) in
the tracking URLs, we have tested 31 different hash/encoding
functions. If the link’s parameters contain the “obfuscated
version” of the receiver’s email address, then the image is
considered as a tracking pixel. As shown in Table XI, we
apply 31 hash/encoding functions on the receiver email address
to look for a match. We also test
two-layer obfuscations
by exhaustively applying two-function combinations, e.g.,
MD5(SHA1()). In total, we examine 992 obfuscated strings
for each address.
