User: I am trying to set up some scheduled tasks for a Django app with celery, hosted on heroku.  Aside from not know how everything should be configured, what is the best way to approach this?
Let's say users can opt to receive a daily email at a time of their choosing.
Should I have a scheduled job that run every, say 5 minutes.  Looks up every user who wants to be emailed at that time and then fire off the emails?
OR
Schedule a task for each user, when they set their preference.  (Not sure how I would actually implement this yet)
Assistant: It depends on how much accuracy you need. Do you want users to select the time down to the minute? second? or will allowing them to select the hour they wish to be emailed be enough.
If on the hour is accurate enough, then use a task that polls for users to mail every hour.
If your users need the mail to go out accurate to the second, then set a task for each user timed to complete on that second.
Everything in between comes down to personal choice. What are you more comfortable doing, and even more importantly: what produces the simplest code with the fewest failure modes?
