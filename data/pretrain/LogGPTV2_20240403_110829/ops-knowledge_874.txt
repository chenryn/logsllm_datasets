Question: In the context of network switches, a common vulnerability arises when ARP mapping tables overflow during spoofing attacks, causing the switch to behave like a hub and broadcast traffic that could be intercepted by an eavesdropper. Which of the following design changes would not prevent this vulnerability?
"A": "Limiting the number of ARP entries that can be recorded for each switch interface.",
"B": "Increasing the size of the ARP table to accommodate more entries.",
"C": "Enabling automatic switch shutdown when a spoofing attack is detected.",
"D": "Designing the switch to broadcast all traffic as a default behavior in case of table overflow."
Answer: D
