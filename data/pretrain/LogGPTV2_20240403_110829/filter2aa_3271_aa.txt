What	
  are	
  most	
  cloud	
  providers	
currently	
  doing?	
•  Providers	
  are	
  trea;ng	
  cloud	
  security	
  as	
  a	
tradi;onal	
  hos;ng	
  environment	
•  Clients	
  are	
  given	
  a	
  virtual	
  ﬁrewall	
  with	
in-­‐line	
  IPS	
  services	
•  Providers	
  frequently	
  oﬀer	
  Vulnerability	
Assessment	
  for	
  free	
•  Each	
  client’s	
  virtual	
  instance	
  is	
independent	
•  Clients	
  are	
  “fending	
  for	
  themselves”	
  with	
no	
  coordinated	
  enterprise	
  security	
Conven;onal	
  Solu;on:	
  IPS	
•  Very	
  diﬃcult	
  for	
  providers	
  to	
  oﬀer	
prepackaged	
  IPS	
  that	
  works	
  for	
  all	
clients	
  and	
  won’t	
  block	
  legi;mate	
traﬃc	
•  Informa;on	
  coming	
  from	
  an	
  IPS	
  is	
frequently	
  incomplete	
  (encryp;on,	
lack	
  of	
  end-­‐point	
  awareness)	
•  In-­‐line	
  IPS	
  has	
  to	
  work	
  at	
  line	
  speeds,	
so	
  very	
  complex	
  correla;ons	
  aren’t	
possible	
Conven;onal	
  Solu;on:	
Tradi;onal	
  Design	
•  Focus	
  on	
external	
  threats	
•  Assume	
  internal	
hosts	
  are	
trusted	
•  Clients	
  can’t	
beneﬁt	
  from	
security	
  data	
being	
  generated	
by	
  other	
  clients	
By	
  the	
  way,	
  how’s	
  that	
  working?	
•  I	
  can’t	
  say	
  for	
  certain	
  what	
  the	
  security	
posture	
  is	
  inside	
  a	
  company	
•  I	
  can	
  guess	
  the	
  nature	
  of	
  the	
  security	
posture	
  based	
  on	
  behaviors	
  of	
  their	
network	
  and	
  personnel	
•  Guesses	
  are	
  based	
  on	
  how	
  frequently	
  a	
par;cular	
  host	
  contacted	
  my	
  network,	
and	
  how	
  long	
  it	
  took	
  for	
  it	
  to	
  stop	
•  Data	
  is	
  from	
  ﬁrst	
  six	
  months	
  of	
  2011	
  (AWS)	
•  There	
  was	
  a	
  single	
  recurring	
  host	
  from	
AWS.	
  Given	
  their	
  size,	
  that’s	
  probably	
  a	
very	
  good	
  indicator
