block (PCB) list.3 However other linked list-based data structures can be similarly sup-
ported as well. The basic procedure is to generate the live set L and periodically generate
and compare with the scanned set S. We tested 8 real-world rootkits and 2 of our own
rootkits (linuxfu and fuuld) previously used in [12,21,23], and these rootkits com-
monly hide kernel objects by directly manipulating the pointers of such objects. LiveDM
successfully detected all these attacks just based on the data anomaly from kernel mem-
ory maps and the results are shown in Table 2.
In the experiments, we focus on a speciﬁc attack mechanism – data hiding via DKOM
– rather than the attack vectors – how to overwrite kernel memory – or other attack fea-
tures of rootkits for the following reason. There are various attack vectors including the
ones that existing approaches cannot handle and they can be easily utilized. Speciﬁcally,
we acknowledge that the rootkits based on loadable kernel module (LKM) can be de-
tected by code integrity approaches [22,24] with the white listing scheme of kernel mod-
ules. However, there exist alternate attack vectors such as /dev/mem, /dev/kmem de-
vices, return-oriented techniques [11,25], and unproven code in third-party kernel drivers
which can elude existing kernel rootkit detection and prevention approaches. We present
the DKOM data hiding cases of LKM-based rootkits as part of our results because these
rootkits can be easily converted to make use of these alternate attack vectors.
We also include results for two other rootkits that make use of these advanced at-
tack techniques. hide lkm and fuuld in Table 2 respectively hide kernel modules and
processes without any kernel code integrity violation (via /dev/kmem) purely based on
DKOM, and current rootkit defense approaches cannot properly detect these attacks.
However, our monitor effectively detects all DKOM data hiding attacks regardless of
attack vectors by leveraging LiveDM-generated kernel object map. Allocation-driven
mapping can uncover the hidden object even in more adversary scenarios. For example,
if a simple linked list having no data invariant is directly manipulated without violating
kernel code integrity, LiveDM will still be able to detect such an attack and uncover the
speciﬁc hidden object.
In the experiments that detect rootkit attacks, we generate and compare L and S sets
every 10 seconds. When a data anomaly occurs, the check is repeated in 1 second. (The

for a particular process. Its data type in Linux is task struct.

repeated check ensures that a kernel data structure was not simply in an inconsistent state
during the ﬁrst scan.) If the anomaly persists, then we consider it as a true positive. With
this monitoring policy, we successfully detected all tested DKOM hiding attacks without
any false positives or false negatives.
We note that while this section focuses on data hiding attacks based on DKOM, data
hiding attacks without manipulating data (such as rootkit code that ﬁlters system call
results) may also be detected using the LiveDM system. Instead of comparing the un-
tampered LiveDM-generated view with the scanned view of kernel memory, one could
simply compare the un-tampered view with the user-level view of the system.
6.2 Temporal Malware Behavior Monitor
Kernel rootkit analysis approaches based on dynamic type-projection are able to perform
temporal analysis of a running rootkit. One problem with these approaches, however, is
that they are only able to track malware actions that occur from injected rootkit code. If
a rootkit modiﬁes memory indirectly through other means such as legitimate kernel func-
tions or kernel bugs,
these approaches are unable to follow the attack.
Allocation-driven mapping does not share this weakness. To further illustrate the
strength of allocation-driven mapping, we built a temporal malware behavior monitor
(called a temporal monitor or a monitor below for brevity) that uses a kernel object map
in temporal analysis of a kernel execution trace.
In this section, we highlight two features that allocation-driven mapping newly pro-
vides. First, allocation-driven mapping enables the use of a kernel object map covering
all kernel objects in temporal analysis; therefore for any given dynamic kernel object
we can inspect how it is being used in the dynamic kernel execution trace regardless
of the accessing code (either legitimate or malicious), which is difﬁcult for both static
and dynamic type-projection approaches. Second, the data lifetime in allocation-driven
mapping lets the monitor avoid the dynamic data identity problem (Section 2.1) which
can be faced by an asynchronous memory map.
Systematic visualization of malware inﬂuence via dynamic kernel memory. Our
monitor systematically inspects and visualizes the inﬂuence of kernel malware attacks
targeting dynamic kernel memory. To analyze this dynamic attack behavior, we gener-
ate a full system trace including the kernel object map status, the executed code, and the
memory accesses during the experiments of kernel rootkits. When a kernel rootkit attack
is launched, if it violates kernel code integrity, the rootkit code is identiﬁed by using our
previous work, NICKLE [22]. Then the temporal monitor systematically identiﬁes all
targets of rootkit memory writes by searching the kernel object map. If the attack does
not violate code integrity, the proposed technique in the previous section or any other ap-
proach can be used to detect the dynamic object under attack. The identiﬁed objects then
become the causes of malware behavior and their effects are systematically visualized
by searching the original and the modiﬁed kernel control ﬂow triggered by such objects.
For each object targeted by the rootkit, there are typically multiple behaviors using its
value. Among those, this monitor samples a pair of behaviors caused by the same code,

the latest one before the attack and the earliest one after the attack, and presents them
for a comparison.
As a running example in this section, we will present the analysis of the attacks by
the adore-ng rootkit. This rootkit is chosen because of its advanced malware behavior
triggered by dynamic objects; and other rootkits can be analyzed in a similar way. Table 3
lists the kernel objects that the adore-ng rootkit tampers with. In particular, we focus on
two speciﬁc attack cases using dynamic objects: (1) The ﬁrst case is the manipulation
of a PCB (T3) for privilege escalation and (2) the second case is the manipulation of
a function pointer in a dynamic proc dir entry object (P1) to hijack kernel control
ﬂow. Fig. 4 presents a detailed view of kernel control ﬂow and the usage of the targeted
dynamic kernel memory in the attacks. The X axis shows the execution time, and kernel
control ﬂow is shown at top part of this ﬁgure. The space below shows the temporal usage
of dynamic memory at the addresses of T3 and P1 before and after rootkit attacks. Thick
horizontal lines represent the lifetime of kernel objects which are temporally allocated
at such addresses. + and × symbols below such lines show the read and write accesses
on corresponding objects. The aforementioned analysis process is illustrated as solid
arrows. From the times when T3 and P1 are manipulated (shown as dotted circles), the
monitor scans the execution trace backward and forward to ﬁnd the code execution that
consumes the values read from such objects (i.e., + symbols).

Selecting semantically relevant kernel behavior using data lifetime. Our monitor in-
spects dynamic memory states in the temporal execution trace and as such we face the
dynamic data identity problem described in Section 3.1. The core of the problem is that
one memory address may correspond with multiple objects over a period of time. This
problem can be solved if the lifetime of the inspected object is available because the
monitor can ﬁlter out irrelevant kernel behaviors triggered by other kernel objects that
share the same memory address. For example, in Fig. 4, we observe the memory for T3
is used for four other PCBs (i.e., T1, T2, T4, and T5) as well in the history of kernel ex-
ecution. Simply relying on the memory address to analyze the trace can lead to ﬁnding
kernel behavior for all ﬁve PCBs. However, the monitor limits the inspected time range
to the lifetime of T3 and select only semantically relevant behaviors to T3. Consequently
it can provide a reliable inspection of runtime behavior only relevant to attacks.
Other kernel memory mapping approaches commonly cannot handle this problem
properly. In static type-projection, when two kernel objects from different snapshots are
given we cannot determine whether they represent the same data instance or not even
though their status is identical because such objects may or may not be different data in-
stances depending on whether memory allocation/deallocation events occur between the
generation of such snapshots. Dynamic type-projection mapping is only based on mal-
ware instructions, and thus does not have information about allocation and deallocation
events which occur during legitimate kernel execution.
Case (1): Privilege escalation using direct memory manipulation. In order to demon-
strate the effectiveness of our temporal monitor we will discuss two speciﬁc attacks em-
ployed by adore-ng. The ﬁrst is a privilege escalation attack that works by modifying
the user and group ID ﬁelds of the PCB. The PCB is represented by T3 in Fig. 4. To
present the changed kernel behavior due to the manipulation of T3, the temporal monitor
ﬁnds the latest use of T3 before the attack (at t2) and the earliest use of it after the attack
(at t3). The data views at such times are presented in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) as 2-dimensional
memory maps where a kernel memory address is represented as the combination of the
address in Y axis and the offset in X axis. These views present kernel objects relevant to
this attack before and after the attack. The manipulated PCB is marked with “Case (1)”
in the views and the values of its ﬁelds are shown in the box on the right side of each view
(PCB status). These values reveal a stealthy rootkit behavior that changes the identity of

(b) The manipulated data view at t3.

a user process by directly patching its PCB (DKOM). Before the attack (Fig. 5(a)), the
PCB has the credentials of an ordinary user whose user ID is 500. However, after the
attack, Fig. 5(b) shows the credentials of the root user. This direct transition of its status
between two accounts is abnormal in conventional operating system environments. su
or sudo allow privileged operations by forking a process to retain the original identity.
Hence we determine that this is a case of privilege escalation that illegally permits the
root privilege to an ordinary user.
Case (2): Dynamic kernel object hooking. The next adore-ng attack hijacks kernel
code execution by modifying a function pointer and this attack is referred to as Kernel
Object Hooking (KOH) [10]. This behavior is observed when the inﬂuence of a manipu-
lated function pointer in P1 (see Fig. 4) is inspected. To select only the behaviors caused
by this object, the monitor guides the analysis to the lifetime of P1. The temporal mon-
itor detects several behaviors caused by reading this object and two samples are chosen
among those to illustrate the change of kernel behavior by comparison: the latest original
behavior before the attack (at t1) and the earliest changed behavior after the attack (at t4).
The monitor generates two kernel control ﬂow graphs at these samples, each for a period
of 4000 instructions. Fig. 6(a) and 6(b) present how this manipulated function pointer
affects runtime kernel behavior. The Y axis presents kernel code; thus, the ﬂuctuating
graphs show various code executed at the corresponding time of X axis. A hook-invoking
function (proc file read) reads the function pointer and calls the hook code pointed
to by it. Before the rootkit attack, the control ﬂow jumps to a legitimate kernel function
tcp get info which calls sprintf after that as shown in Fig. 6(a). However, after the
hook is hijacked, the control ﬂow is redirected to the rootkit code which calls kmalloc
to allocate its own memory, then comes back to the original function (Fig. 6(b)).

7 Discussion
Since LiveDM operates in the VMM beneath the hardware interface, we assume that
kernel malware cannot directly access LiveDM code or data. However, it can exhibit po-
tentially obfuscating behavior to confuse the view seen by LiveDM. Here we describe
Kernel Malware Analysis with Un-tampered and Temporal Views
195
several scenarios in which malware can affect LiveDM and our counter-strategies to de-
tect them.
First, malware can implement its own custom memory allocators to bypass LiveDM
observation. This attack behavior can be detected based on the observation that any mem-
ory allocator must use internal kernel data structures to manage memory regions or its
memory may be accidentally re-allocated by the legitimate memory allocator. Therefore,
we can detect unveriﬁed memory allocations by comparing the resource usage described
in the kernel data structures with the amount of memory being tracked by LiveDM. Any
deviance may indicate the presence of a custom memory allocator.
In a different attack strategy, malware could manipulate valid kernel control ﬂow and
jump into the body of a memory allocator without entering the function from the be-
ginning. This behavior can be detected by extending LiveDM to verify that the function
was entered properly. For example, the VMM can set a ﬂag when a memory allocation
function is entered and verify the ﬂag before the function returns by interceding before
the return instruction(s) of the function. If the ﬂag was not set prior to the check, the
VMM detects a suspicious memory allocation.
8 Related Work
Static type-projection mapping has been widely used in the defense against kernel mal-
ware attacks. SBCFI [16] detects persistent manipulations to the kernel control ﬂow
graph by using kernel memory maps. Gibraltar [1] derives data invariants based on a
kernel memory map to detect kernel malware. KOP [5] improves the accuracy of map-
ping using extended type graph based on static analysis in addition to memory analysis.
Complementing these approaches, allocation-driven mapping provides an un-tampered
view of kernel objects where their identiﬁcation is not affected by kernel malware’s ma-
nipulation of the kernel memory content. It also accurately reﬂects the temporal status of
dynamic kernel memory, which makes it applicable to temporal analysis of kernel/kernel
malware execution.
PoKeR [23] and Rkproﬁler [31] use dynamic type-projection mapping generated from
rootkit instructions to understand the rootkit behavior. Since only rootkit activity is used
as the input to generate a kernel memory map, this approach can only cover the kernel
objects directly manipulated by rootkit code. Moreover, there exist the attacks that are
difﬁcult to be analyzed by these proﬁlers because rootkits can use various resource such
as hardware registers to ﬁnd the attack targets [21].
KernelGuard (KG) [20] is a system that prevents DKOM-based kernel rootkits by
monitoring and shepherding kernel memory accesses. It identiﬁes kernel objects to be
monitored by scanning the kernel memory using data structure-speciﬁc policies enforced
at the VMM level. Similar to type-projection mapping, KG’s view of kernel memory is
based on the runtime kernel memory content which is subject to malware manipulation.
As such, KG’s reliability can be improved by adopting LiveDM as the underlying kernel
memory mapping mechanism.
LiveDM involves techniques to capture the location, type, and lifetime of individ-
ual dynamic kernel objects, which can be described as belonging to the area of virtual
machine introspection [9].

9 Conclusion
We have presented allocation-driven mapping, a kernel memory mapping scheme, and
LiveDM, its implementation. By capturing the kernel objects’ allocation and dealloca-
tion events, our scheme provides an un-tampered view of kernel objects that will not
be affected by kernel malware’s manipulation of kernel memory content. The LiveDM-
generated kernel object map accurately reﬂects the status of dynamic kernel memory and
tracks the lifetimes of all dynamic kernel objects. This temporal property is highly desir-
able in temporal kernel execution analysis where both kernel control ﬂow and dynamic
memory status can be analyzed in an integrated fashion. We demonstrate the effective-
ness of the LiveDM system by developing a hidden kernel object detector and a temporal
malware behavior monitor and applying them to a corpus of kernel rootkits.
