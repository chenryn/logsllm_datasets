NetB and NetC networks while it is around 7 msec for the
NetA network.
For the location in New Brunswick, looking at Figure 5(e,f),
we ﬁnd that the TCP and UDP throughput for NetB and
NetC has higher variability than the location in Madison.
Although the overall variation is still lower than 0.15. Akin
to the location in Madison, both networks have low jitter
(less than 3 msec) and packet loss (less than 1%).
Fine time scale: In Table 4, we present the standard
deviation for throughput, jitter, and loss rate calculated for
10 seconds bins and 30 minute bins for all three networks for
both locations, to compare and contrast the network charac-
teristics at ﬁne time scales with coarse time scales.As can be
seen from the table, the standard deviations over coarse and
ﬁne timescales vary signiﬁcantly. For example, at the loca-
tion in Madison, the standard deviation of TCP throughput
is 211 Kbps at coarse timescales, whereas it is around 377
Kbps at ﬁner timescales, a diﬀerence of 159 (377-211) Kbps.
Similar observations can be drawn for other metrics across
all the networks. This diﬀerence in standard deviation is
expected as 30 minutes is a large duration of time which
can hide large ﬂuctuations in performance. We can make
similar observation for the measurements collected at the
location in New Brunswick. The high degree of variation at
short time scales eﬀectively rules out the use of small and
infrequent measurements to estimate performance.
Finally, given the relatively low overall jitter (less than 10
msec) and no losses in the networks, we desist from present-
ing further jitter and loss performance results for the sake
of brevity.

ric is stable. A metric should be estimated for each epoch
independently. We use the Allan deviation measure [18] to
determine the epoch for which the metric is stable. The
Allan deviation is used to calculate the frequency stability
of a variable and is deﬁned as the square root of the Al-
lan variance. Allan variance is then deﬁned as the variance
between two measurement values formed by the average of
the squared diﬀerences between successive values of a regu-
larly measured quantity. The sampling period of the mea-
surement also forms a parameter which determines the time
granularity at which the Allan deviation is measured. The
diﬀerence from standard deviation arises from the usage of
immediate measurement values to calculate the diﬀerence
terms, instead, of using the long term mean.
It is mathematically expressed as,
i=1 (Ti+1−Ti)2
2(N −1)
σy(τ0) = r PN −1
Where, Ti are the averaged measurement values collected
at time instance i and N is the total number of available
measurement values. A low Allan deviation implies that the
current values do not diﬀer much from the previous values.
In contrast, large Allan deviation would signify that the co-
herence of the measured metric is changing.
We present the Allan deviation of UDP throughput at
the two zones for the NetB network using the Proximate
dataset in Figure 6 as an example.
In the ﬁgure, the x-
axis of the plot represents the periodic burst duration while
the y-axis represents the corresponding Allan deviation. We
ﬁnd that, for the zone in Madison, Allan deviation becomes
the lowest around a time duration of about 75 minutes. This
value is higher (mostly greater than 0.5) at both smaller and
larger values. For the zone in New Brunswick we ﬁnd that
Allan deviation is lowest around 15 minutes. We pick this
minimum value of the Allan deviation is the epoch duration
for the corresponding zone. Epochs for other metrics can
similarly be determined using the above method.
In WiScape, we collect measurements from clients to get
stable estimates in each epoch for a zone, re-starting this
process as we move from one epoch to the next. Hence,
for the representative zone from Madison, the measurement
