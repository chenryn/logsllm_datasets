For a week now, sometines, the namespaces property in bootstrap.php.cache is
null, which trigger this error:
Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in app/bootstrap.php.cache on
line 1211  
Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in app/bootstrap.php.cache on
line 1211  
Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in app/bootstrap.php.cache on

Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in app/bootstrap.php.cache on

Fatal error: Class 'Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationRegistry' not found
in app/autoload.php on line 35
And after a few hours, without doing anything special, everything returns to
normal, until the error reappears.  
What makes me create a bug is that, a little annoyed by this error, I
completely deleted my project, downloaded the latest symfony version, re-
installed my vendors to get back on a clean. But the error is still there...
I checked three times, the class AnnotationRegistry exists in my project.  
It can not be a issue between incompatible version bundle, since it is a clean
symfony that is installed.
Is there a hidden cache in symfony | doctrine that I could empty ? How can it
be that even after reinstalling my symfony version, the error is still there?
More generally, how is it possible that the namespaces property is empty in
bootstrap.php.cache ?
I am aware that github is not a support forum, but I feel that there is here
an issue that goes beyond my Symfony installation. It's strange that the error
persists even after reinstalling symfony.
