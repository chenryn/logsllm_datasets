More general conditions (§3.4). Let ℎ𝑞 be a condition that
requires all links in 𝜂𝑞 to be alive and all links in 𝜉𝑞 to be dead.
Then we model ℎ𝑞 by linearizing the constraint:

𝑒∈𝜉𝑞

𝜂𝑞
ℎ𝑞 =
𝑥𝑒
(1 − 𝑥𝑒)
as follows:
(ℎ𝑞 − 1) + 𝑥𝑒 ≤ 0 ∀𝑒 ∈ 𝜂𝑞
ℎ𝑞 − 𝑥𝑒 ≤ 0 ∀𝑒 ∈ 𝜉𝑞
(1 − ℎ𝑞) − 
𝑥𝑒 −
𝑒∈𝜂𝑞
𝑒∈𝜉𝑞
0 ≤ ℎ𝑞 ≤ 1.
(1 − 𝑥𝑒) ≤ 0
We model 𝑌 𝐻 by adding the above constraints for each LS 𝑞 to (4).
Proof of Proposition 5. We will show 𝑀 ∈ R𝑃×𝑃 is a weakly-
chained diagonally dominant matrix, where 𝑀𝑖 𝑗,𝑖1 𝑗1 ≤ 0 for (𝑖, 𝑗) ≠
(𝑖1, 𝑗1). Then, it follows from Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in [8] that 𝑀 is
an invertible M-Matrix.
For a particular failure scenario 𝑥, let 𝑇𝑥 (𝑠, 𝑡) denote the set of
alive tunnels from 𝑠 to 𝑡, 𝐿𝑥 (𝑠, 𝑡) denote the set of active LSs from 𝑠
to 𝑡 and 𝑄𝑥 (𝑠, 𝑡) denote the active LSs which go through segment
(𝑠, 𝑡). We first give the formal definition of 𝑃, the set of node pairs
of interest. A node pair (𝑖1, 𝑗1) ∈ 𝑃 if and only if there is a sequence
of node pairs (𝑖1, 𝑗1), (𝑖2, 𝑗2),...,(𝑖𝑘, 𝑗𝑘), such that 𝑧𝑖𝑘 𝑗𝑘 𝑑𝑖𝑘 𝑗𝑘 > 0
and ∀𝑚 : 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 𝑘 − 1, ∃𝑞 ∈ 𝐿𝑥 (𝑖𝑚+1, 𝑗𝑚+1) ∩ 𝑄𝑥 (𝑖𝑚, 𝑗𝑚) such
that 𝑏𝑞 > 0. There is a chain of LSs, such that a preceding LS serves
a segment in the subsequent LS, where the last LS serves a pair
with non-zero allocation and the first LS contains (𝑖, 𝑗). For the
node pairs which are not included in 𝑃, we set 𝑈 (𝑖, 𝑗) = 0.
Next, we formally define each entry in 𝑀. The diagonal of 𝑀 is
the sum of available reservations on the pair, i.e.∀(𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝑃, 𝑀𝑖 𝑗,𝑖 𝑗 =
node pair needs to carry for other node pairs, i.e. for (𝑖, 𝑗) ≠ (𝑚, 𝑛)
It is easy to see that 𝑀 is weakly diagonally dominated because
𝑀 × (cid:174)1 ≥ (cid:174)𝐷 ≥ 0, where the first inequality is the capacity constraint
and second because 𝑧𝑝𝑑𝑝 ≥ 0 for all 𝑝.
From our definition of 𝑃, we know that ∀(𝑖1, 𝑗1) ∈ 𝑃, there
is a sequence (𝑖1, 𝑗1), (𝑖2, 𝑗2),...,(𝑖𝑘, 𝑗𝑘), such that 𝑧𝑖𝑘 𝑗𝑘 𝑑𝑖𝑘 𝑗𝑘 > 0
and ∀𝑚 : 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 𝑘 − 1, ∃𝑞 ∈ 𝐿𝑥 (𝑖𝑚+1, 𝑗𝑚+1) ∩ 𝑄𝑥 (𝑖𝑚, 𝑗𝑚) :
𝑏𝑞 > 0. Thus, for each row (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝑃, there is a sequence (𝑖1, 𝑗1),
(𝑖2, 𝑗2),...,(𝑖𝑘, 𝑗𝑘), such that
𝑀𝑖𝑘 𝑗𝑘,𝑚𝑛
𝑙∈𝑇𝑥 (𝑖,𝑗) 𝑎𝑙 +𝑞∈𝐿𝑥 (𝑖,𝑗) 𝑏𝑞. Other entries of 𝑀 denote how much a

chained diagonally dominant matrix. Since, for (𝑖, 𝑗) ≠ (𝑖1, 𝑗1),
invertible M-matrix and there is a unique solution (cid:174)𝑈 ∗ to the linear
system 𝑀 × (cid:174)𝑈 = (cid:174)𝐷.
Next, we use Brouwer fixed-point theorem [7] to prove that all
entries of the solution are in [0, 1]. Let 𝑓 ( (cid:174)𝑈) be a function mapping
from [0, 1]𝑃 to R𝑃. We define 𝑓 ( (cid:174)𝑈) as
𝑓 ( (cid:174)𝑈)𝑖,𝑗 =
Observe that the denominator is larger than zero. If not, it follows
from weak diagonal dominance that 𝑀𝑖 𝑗,𝑖′ 𝑗′ = 0 for all (𝑖′, 𝑗′) ≠

solution to 𝑀 × (cid:174)𝑈 = (cid:174)𝐷 if 𝑓 ( (cid:174)𝑈0) = (cid:174)𝑈0. With (cid:174)𝑈 ∈ [0, 1]𝑃, we have

(13)
where the first inequality is because (cid:174)𝑈 (𝑚, 𝑛) ≤ 1, 𝑏𝑞 ≥ 0, and the
denominator is positive. The second inequality is from the capacity
constraint. Since 𝑓 is a continuous function mapping from [0, 1]𝑃 to
[0, 1]𝑃, and [0, 1]𝑃 is a compact convex set, it follows from Brouwer
fixed-point theorem [7] that there is at least one point 𝑈0 ∈ [0, 1]𝑃
so that 𝑓 (𝑈0) = 𝑈0, which we have already argued is the unique
solution to 𝑀 × (cid:174)𝑈 = (cid:174)𝐷. □
Proof of Proposition 6. We consider (𝑠, 𝑡) column of 𝑀−1,
which exists by Proposition 5, and denote it as 𝜆.
By definition, 𝑀 = 𝐴 + 𝐵 where 𝐴 is a diagonal matrix with
𝐴𝑠𝑡,𝑠𝑡 =𝑙∈𝑇𝑥 (𝑠,𝑡) 𝑎𝑙, 𝐵𝑠𝑡,𝑠𝑡 =𝑞∈𝐿𝑥 (𝑠,𝑡) 𝑏𝑞, and for (𝑠, 𝑡) ≠ (𝑚, 𝑛),
𝐵𝑠𝑡,𝑚𝑛 = −(𝑚,𝑛)∈𝑃,𝑞∈𝑄𝑥 (𝑠,𝑡)∩𝐿𝑥 (𝑚,𝑛) 𝑏𝑞. Then it follows that

Table 3: Topologies used in evaluation
Topologies summary (§5). Our evaluation is done using 21
topologies obtained from [22] and [23]. The number of nodes and
the number of edges of each topology is shown in Table 3.

where 𝑒𝑠𝑡 is (𝑠, 𝑡)𝑡ℎ unit vector in R𝑃 and 𝑀𝑚𝑛,· denotes the column

Now, 𝑒𝑠𝑡 can be interpreted as a directed path carrying a unit flow
from 𝑠 to 𝑡. Moreover, we show that 𝐵𝑚𝑛,· is a circulation since
it can be written as an addition of cycles, one for each logical
sequence servicing (𝑚, 𝑛). To show this, we only need to show that
for any 𝑞 ∈ 𝐿𝑥 (𝑖, 𝑗) with 𝑏𝑞 > 0, if (𝑘, 𝑙) is a logical segment in 𝑞,
that is if 𝑞 ∈ 𝑄𝑥 (𝑘, 𝑙), then (𝑘, 𝑙) ∈ 𝑃. Since (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝑃, there is a
weak chain from (𝑖, 𝑗) to a strictly dominated pair. The existence
of 𝑞 shows that (𝑘, 𝑙) is connected to (𝑖, 𝑗) since 𝑀𝑘𝑙,𝑖 𝑗 ≤ 𝑏𝑞  0 are included in 𝑃. There-
fore, (cid:174)𝐷 contains all the serviced demands and the proof is complete.
