I'm on commit `9f6d389` (master) to check out the folding stuff and I really
like it! :)
I noticed it isn't possible to fold empty regions like the interface below and
the empty function. The fold arrow doesn't appear. Is this by design? There
isn't that much to fold, only some newlines so it isn't a big issue though.
ps. I'm using TypeScript
    interface test {
    }
    function name(params:type) {
    }
**edit** If it is by design, feel free to close
