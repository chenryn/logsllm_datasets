**Current Behavior**
The current code calls the `.callFn` method. In a unit test, the `DynamicTestModule`'s `module.ngfactory.js` output is `jit_NgModuleInjector0.call(this, parent, [], []);`. This call fails because `NgModuleInjector` is a class and should be instantiated using the `new` keyword.

**Expected Behavior**
I believe that in some cases, the `.instantiate` method should be used instead of `.callFn`.

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions**
Please refer to the plunk in [issue #14808](#14808). However, that issue currently blocks the reproduction of this problem. To bypass that issue, you can modify the `useFactory: () => ...` to `useFactory: function (...)`. After making this change, this issue should be the next one you encounter. I attempted to create a gist with a modified `compiler.js`, but GitHub does not seem to accept the theta character used for internal exports.
