Sensors
• Active vs Passive
• Common sensors:
• GPS
• LIDAR
• Cameras
• Millimeter Wave Radar
• Ultrasonic Transducers
• Digital Compass
• IMU
• Wheel Encoders
• Doppler Velocity Logger (subsurface)
• Scanning SONAR (subsurface)
• Pressure Transducers (air & subsurface)
Sensors
• Sources of uncertainty:
• Noise
• Drift
• Latency & update rate
• Uncertainty must be modeled under assumptions
• Sensor fusion:
• Fused/registered data can be more useful than separate
• What to do when sensors disagree?
• Robot robustness may come down to:
• How smart is it at discounting 1 bad/spoofed sensor?
Sensor Attacks
• 2 kinds:
• Denial
• Preventing sensor from recovering useful data
• Spoofng
• Causing sensor to retrieve specifcally incorrect data
• Basic attack mode choice:
• Attack sensors instantaneously
• Attack aggregated sensor data
GPS
• Denial:
• Jamming
• Spoofng:
• Fake GPS satellite signals at higher
power

• Preventing return signal
• Spoofng:
• Manipulating absorbence/refectivity
• Active spoofng
LIDAR
• 2D sensor highly orientation dependent
• Inclines can look like obstacles
• May miss low obstacles & discontinuities
LIDAR
• Active emission sensor
• Can only see what returns a signal
• No return = nothing there
LIDAR
• Absorbent things look like nothing
• Also transparent
LIDAR
• Refective things can confuse laser
• Faraway things brought near
• Loss of return looks like ditch

human
LIDAR
• Solid looking objects look solid
!
LIDAR
• Denial: strong source overpowers LIDAR in a certain area
Shin, Kim, Kwon, Kim, KAIST, 2017
LIDAR
• Spoofng: weaker sources cause false returns
• Can exploit curved glass refraction to alter location of false returns
• Depends on source strength
Shin, Kim, Kwon, Kim, KAIST, 2017

The Map
• Traffc lights
• Camera knows where to look
• Difference in robot vs human
assumptions
The Map
• Vegetation
• Colorized LIDAR
• Transmission classifer
• Overhanging foliage
• Map dependence may exacerbate brittleness of discrimination rules
The Map
• Map requires constant updates
• Local map:
• Vulnerable to unexpected real world features
• Remote map:
• Vulnerable to denial (4G jamming)
• Vulnerable to spoofng (MITM attack, standard cellular intercept techniques)

Would you buy a self-driving car that couldn’t
drive itself in 99 percent of the country?
Or that knew nearly nothing about parking,
couldn’t be taken out in snow or heavy rain,
and would drive straight over a gaping pothole?
