### Priorities and Roadblocks
- **Priorities**:
  - **Precision Agriculture**
  - **Self-Driving Cars**
- **Roadblocks**:
  - **Shared Infrastructure (Airspace, Roads)**
  - **Acceptance (Safety, Robustness)**

## Classic Failures
- **Sandstorm (DARPA Grand Challenge 2004)**:
  - **State Estimation**: Correct state estimation is crucial for decision-making.
  - **Exploits**: Successful attacks often subvert state estimation.
- **Fatal Tesla Autopilot Accident (US-101, March 2018)**:
  - **Dynamic Cruise Control + Autosteer Lane Following**: 120 kph impact with a previously damaged crash attenuator.
  - **Vehicle Behavior**: Selected poor lane markings over lead vehicle.
  - **Decision Making**: Fragile and prone to edge cases.

## Autonomous Vehicle Logic Structures
- **Activity Hierarchy**:
  - **Control Loops, Stability Maintenance**
  - **Collision Avoidance**
  - **Navigation & Localization**
  - **Mission Task Planners/Reasoners**
- **Attack Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Lower Layers**: More engineering effort spent on guaranteed robustness.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Lifesaving Drone**: GPS waypoint circuit, dynamic "bombing run" planner, impact point estimator.
    - **Pizza Delivery Drone**: Balancing, weight shifting, dynamic obstacle discrimination, route planning from SLAM-generated sensor map, pizza dispensing.

## Sensors
- **Active vs. Passive Sensors**:
  - **Common Sensors**: GPS, LIDAR, Cameras, Millimeter Wave Radar, Ultrasonic Transducers, Digital Compass, IMU, Wheel Encoders, Doppler Velocity Logger, Scanning SONAR, Pressure Transducers.
- **Sources of Uncertainty**:
  - **Noise, Drift, Latency, Update Rate**
  - **Sensor Fusion**: Fused/registered data can be more useful than separate data.
  - **Disagreement Handling**: How smart is the system at discounting one bad or spoofed sensor?

### Sensor Attacks
- **Denial**:
  - **Preventing Useful Data Recovery**
- **Spoofing**:
  - **Causing Specific Incorrect Data Retrieval**
- **Basic Attack Modes**:
  - **Instantaneous Attack on Sensors**
  - **Aggregated Sensor Data Attack**

#### GPS
- **Denial**: Jamming
- **Spoofing**: Fake GPS satellite signals at higher power
- **UT Austin Radionavigation Laboratory**: Low-cost GPS simulator using BladeRF SDR, HackRF One, and gps-sdr-sim.

#### LIDAR
- **Denial**: Active overpowering, preventing return signal.
- **Spoofing**: Manipulating absorbance/reflectivity, active spoofing.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Orientation-dependent, may miss low obstacles, confusion due to reflective surfaces.

#### Cameras
- **Object Detection**: Specialized object detection, stereo for depth maps.
- **Denial**: Easily dazzled.
- **Spoofing**: Camouflage techniques, color assumptions, repeating patterns, adversarial examples.

#### MMW RADAR
- **Collision Avoidance**: Lower resolution than LIDAR.
- **Denial/Spoofing**: Jamming, chaff, overhead signs.

#### IMU & Compass
- **Primary Navigation Sensor**: High-fidelity models available.
- **Denial/Spoofing**: Physical attacks with magnetic fields, thermal drift.

#### Acoustic Attacks on IMU
- **MEMS Gyroscope**: Perturbed with external acoustic sources, similar to hard disk attacks.

#### Wheel Odometry
- **Encoders**: Useful for true speed and stop detection.
- **Attacks**: Changing wheel diameter, slippery surfaces, removal leading to unpredictable behavior.

#### Ultrasonic Sensors
- **Automated Parking**: Only used at low speed.
- **Attacks**: Jamming, spoofing, cancellation.

### Bond vs. Robots
- **GPS Jammer, Smoke/Dust/Vapor, Lightweight Decoy Obstacles, Chaff, Glass Caltrops, Oil Slick, Active LIDAR Jammer/Spoofer, Active Radar Jammer, Acoustic Blaster, Lane Marker & Adversarial Turtle Dispenser**.

## The Map
- **Preacquired Map Data**: Considered reference ground truth, reduces recognition load.
- **Traffic Lights, Vegetation, Speed Control, Traffic Management Features**.
- **Map Updates**: Local and remote vulnerabilities, including denial and spoofing.

### Exploiting the Logic Structure
- **Goal**: Maximize uncertainty, require manual assistance, confuse occupants, inconvenience other road users.
- **Fragile Maneuvers**: Attacker has access to the map.

### Trapping/Redirecting
- **Attacks on Collision Avoidance and Navigation Layers**: Force robot to postpone high-level tasks, moving obstacles, obstacle swarms, artificial stop signs.

### Clobbering
- **Subvert Collision Avoidance**: Incapacitate vehicle, damage/remove sensors, subtle map deviations, imitate light vegetation, simulate obstacles at speed, disguise entrance walls with reflective/absorbent material, dynamic obstacles under overhead signs.

### V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) Communications
- **Components**: On-board and roadside communicators, DSRC (Omnidirectional, 300m range, 200-500 bytes), Basic Safety Message (BSM) protocol, not encrypted, PKI authenticated.
- **Transmissions**: Core and appended parts, unencrypted GPS, potential for spoofing feedback.
- **Security Concerns**: Tracking/Privacy, standard PKI concerns, no direct control imminent.

### Traffic Sensor Flaws
- **Hacking US Traffic Control Systems**: No encryption/authentication, wireless transmission in cleartext, firmware updates neither encrypted nor signed.

### Consequences
- **Driverless vehicles are cool!**
- **Do not engage in any of these activities!**
- **Respect the technology and its potential!**
