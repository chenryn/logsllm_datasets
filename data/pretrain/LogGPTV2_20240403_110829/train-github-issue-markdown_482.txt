## Expected Behavior
When using a grid that scrolls vertically, a horizontal scrollbar should not
be necessary.
## Current Behavior
The grid looks like it generates double the needed spacing on the right side,
resulting in a layout that is slightly too wide for the screen, and needs a
horizontal scrollbar.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Add spacing to a grid container
  2. Sometimes the issue happens
Here's the issue
Adding some padding to an outer div prevents it from happening
