Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the template extraction:

**Log Line:**
```
NIFF: node node-45 has detected an available network connection on network 5.5.224.0 via interface alt0
```

**Extracted Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<node_id> has detected an available network connection on network <network_address> via interface alt0
```

In this template:
- `<node_id>` represents the unique identifier for the node (e.g., `45`).
- `<network_address>` represents the IP address of the network (e.g., `5.5.224.0`).

This format ensures clarity and consistency when documenting or analyzing similar log entries.
