of all Internet ASes, versus 7% for the random-no-ring-1
placement.
Figure 5 further shows that deploying decoys in the ring
ASes of China ampliﬁes the costs of the Chinese RAD attack.
Another observation based on Figure 5 is that, while global
decoy deployment is more effective, even regional deployment
causes China to lose much of its connectivity.

after the RAD attack (Figures 5c and 5f). Each AS is weighted

weighted according to the weights of the ASes on the route.
measured latency between two PoPs X and Y from iPlane’s
“Inter-PoP links” dataset (see Section VI). For a BGP/RBGP
path composed of k ASes {T1, ..., Tk}, we deﬁne eLat to be
the sum of eLat for all neighbor ASes in the path:
In the rest of the simulations, we only consider the “no-
ring” placements (i.e., we do not select decoy Ases from
among the ring ASes).

B. Non-valley-free paths
The key technique suggested by the RAD paper is to
re-route trafﬁc between different adversary-controlled ASes
in order to take advantage of more alternative routes (see
Section III-B). As discussed in Section IV, routing through
NVF paths is extremely costly. Figure 6 shows the percentage
of paths that become NVF (the denominator includes only
reachable destinations). In all cases, a large fraction of des-
tinations are only reachable via NVF paths. Deploying decoys
in ASes with larger customer cones ampliﬁes this effect.
Table 7 shows the average number of Chinese transit ASes
that must transit NVF trafﬁc. This estimates how many links
of the NVF paths are “inside the valley.”
C. Costly valley-free paths
We now demonstrate that even valley-free (VF) paths
selected by the Chinese ASes as part of the RAD attack are
more costly than the paths that would have been selected in
the absence of the attack.
Using less-preferred paths (Business): Figure 8 shows
the percentage of VF paths that become more expensive as
a consequence of using RBGP (this is the Business cost
described in Section IV). This ratio varies between 6% and
21% depending on the placement strategy.
Note that, in the case of random-no-ring-1 placement,
this ratio declines as the number of decoy ASes increases. The
reason is that as the number of decoy ASes increases, more
destinations are reachable only via (even costlier) NVF paths,
as shown in Figure 6.
Longer paths (Length):
In Section IV, we discussed the
effects of longer paths on the quality of service. Figure 9 shows
the percentage of VF paths that become longer when RBGP
is used instead of BGP. This percentage varies between 20%
and 43% depending on the placement strategy. The average
increase in path length varies from 1.12 to 1.40.
Higher latencies (Latency): We now show that even when
RBGP selects paths of the same length as the corresponding
BGP paths, the RBGP paths are likely to have signiﬁcantly
higher latency. The reason for this increase is that RBGP paths
are forced to use less popular transit ASes which have less
network capacity (see Section IV).
To estimate latency, we use the following metric. For two
neighbor ASes A and B, we deﬁne eLat as:
eLat(A, B) =
1
nA ∗ nB
nA
nB
!
!
i=1
j=1
Lat(Ai, Bj)
where Ai represents the ith point-of-presence (PoP) of the AS
A and nA is the number of A’s PoPs. Lat(X, Y ) returns the
The raw eLat metric is a coarse estimate that may not
represent the actual latency of a given path. That said, we can
use the relative increase in eLat due to the RAD attack, i.e.,
the ratio between eLat for an RBGP path and eLat for the
corresponding BGP path, to estimate the increase in actual
latency, without knowing the exact value of the former.
The iPlane dataset does not contain the latencies for every
PoP pair and every AS. Therefore, we only estimate latencies
for the paths where the latency of each individual link is
available in the dataset.
Figure 10 show that
the RAD attack causes a signif-
increase in the eLat metric. For instance, for the
icant
random-no-ring-1 placement
(the random placement
strategy considered in the RAD paper, with decoys placed
in only 1% of ASes), launching the RAD attack makes the
routes from China to Internet destinations over 4 times slower.
The impact
is even worse when decoys are placed more
strategically and/or in more ASes.
The ﬂuctuations in the graphs are caused by the limitations
of the iPlane dataset, which prevent us from estimating latency
for some of the paths (i.e., some of the paths chosen by Chinese
ASes to avoid a particular decoy placement “disappear” from
the measurements).
D. The need for infrastructural changes
Launching the RAD attack requires China to make dra-
matic changes to its network infrastructure.
Edge ASes acting as transit ASes (NewTransit):
The
RAD attack fundamentally assumes that all Chinese ASes
are capable and willing to transit trafﬁc for each other (see
Section III-B). However, as discussed earlier, the majority of
the Internet ASes are edge ASes and do not have the requisite
network equipment and resources to transit other ASes’ trafﬁc.
Our simulations show that the RAD attack requires many
edge ASes to be converted into transit ASes, requiring huge
re-organization and investment in their network infrastructure.
China currently has 199 ASes, of which only 30 are transit
ASes. Figure 11 shows the number of Chinese edge ASes
that must become transit ASes in order to launch the RAD
attack. For example, a random-no-ring-1 placement in
the China-World scenario with decoys in 2% of all ASes
requires 59 edge ASes to be converted into transit ASes, almost
doubling the number of transit ASes in China.
Converting a typical edge AS into a transit AS is highly
non-trivial. Besides the monetary costs of purchasing and de-
ploying new networking equipment, the organizational policies
of edge ASes present signiﬁcant obstacles. For example, would
a university-owned ISP built for educational purposes or an ISP
owned by a private, international company be willing—or even
capable, if forced by the government—to act a transit AS?

Increased load on existing transit ASes (TransitLoad):
Transit ASes are signiﬁcantly affected by changes in their
transit
the RAD attack
dramatically changes transit loads on many Chinese transit
ASes. Since we only consider the trafﬁc that leaves China,
our estimates are conservative.
The information on trafﬁc volumes between Internet ASes
is not public. To simulate changes in transit loads, we assume
that trafﬁc volume between two ASes AS1 and AS2 is propor-
tional to the number of IP addresses they respectively possess:
L(AS1, AS2) = IP s(AS1) × IP s(AS2)

load increase factor over all 30 transit ASes in China, for the
China-World and China-US scenarios.
We add L(AS1, AS2) to the load of every transit AS on the
path from AS1 to AS2. In other words, we model the transit
load of a transit AS as the sum of trafﬁc volumes for all paths
that cross this AS.
This model may not be accurate for some ASes since the
higher number of IP addresses does not necessarily imply
higher trafﬁc volumes. However, it provides us with a simple
estimate of transit loads in the absence of public data on actual
trafﬁc volumes. Furthermore, the inaccuracy is averaged across
all paths, thus overestimates and underestimates cancel out to
some extent.
Using this model for each Chinese transit AS A, we
compute the transit load increase factor, which is the ratio
of A’s transit
load after the RAD attack over A’s transit
load before the attack (we exclude trafﬁc that does not leave
China). Table IV shows the maximum value of the transit
The RAD attack signiﬁcantly increases loads on some
transit ASes because they are forced to transit additional trafﬁc,
e.g., that of NVF paths. Some of the increases are so drastic
that we believe it is extremely unlikely that existing transit
ASes will be able to handle them. For example, assuming a
random-no-ring-1 placement with decoys deployed on
2% of ASes in the China-World scenario, there is a Chinese
transit AS that must transit roughly 122 times more trafﬁc due
to the RAD attack.
Tables V and VI show the median transit load increase
factor for the most affected 10% and 20% of transit ASes,
respectively. The increase factor grows rapidly with the number
of decoy ASes and with better decoy placements since both
force Chinese ASes to route more trafﬁc over NVF paths.
The RAD attack also causes some transit ASes to lose
transit trafﬁc, which is the source of their revenue. Table VII

shows the minimum values of the transit load increase factor.
For the random-no-ring-1 placement, there is a transit
AS that loses 30% of its transit load. Tables VIII and IX show
the median and average changes in transit load, respectively.
Transit
load does not
increase monotonically with the
number of decoy ASes. On the one hand,
increasing the
number of decoy ASes increases load imbalance and forces
more trafﬁc to shift to better-connected transit ASes. On the
other hand, increasing the number of decoy ASes makes more
destination ASes unreachable (see Figure 5) and thus reduces
overall transit trafﬁc. Furthermore, the results for the random
simulations are reported for different, randomly selected decoy
placements, which may have slightly different effects on the
distribution of transit loads.
VIII. LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1.
The RAD attack proposed by Schuchard et al. [24] is
extremely costly to the censors, even for the simple decoy
placement considered in the RAD paper. The costs include
collateral damage due to the loss of connectivity to many
Internet destinations and much lower quality of service for
the remaining destinations, monetary costs of buying and de-
ploying new networking equipment needed to re-route massive
amounts of trafﬁc and convert edge ASes into transit ASes, and
monetary costs caused by switching to less-preferred and, in
particular, non-valley-free paths.
Even if the censors are willing to pay the monetary costs,
evidence indicates that social costs may prevent them from
