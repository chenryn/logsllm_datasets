User: Does anyone know where or how to set the default path/directory on saving python scripts prior to running?  
On a Mac it wants to save them in the top level ~/Documents directory. I would like to specify a real location. Any ideas?
Assistant: It seems like you can get idle into the directory you want if you run any module from that directory. 
I had previously tried opening idlemain.py through the path browser. I was able to open and edit the file, but it seemed like I wasn't able to save my modifications.
I'm just glad to hear other people are having this problem. I just thought I was being stupid.
