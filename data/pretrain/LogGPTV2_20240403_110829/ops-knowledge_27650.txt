**Question:**
Does anyone know how to set the default save path or directory for Python scripts before running them? On a Mac, the system defaults to saving them in the top-level `~/Documents` directory. I would like to specify a different location. Any suggestions?

**Response:**
To change the default save directory for Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Run a Module from the Desired Directory:**
   One way to set the working directory is to run a module from the desired location. This will set the current working directory to the one where the module is located.

2. **Modify the IDLE Configuration:**
   If you are using IDLE (the integrated development environment that comes with Python), you can try modifying the `idlemain.py` file. However, it seems that simply opening and editing this file through the path browser may not allow you to save your changes. 

3. **Alternative Solutions:**
   - **Use a Script to Change the Working Directory:**
     You can create a small script that changes the working directory to your preferred location at the start of your session. For example:
     ```python
     import os
     os.chdir('/path/to/your/directory')
     ```

   - **Set Up a Custom Shortcut or Alias:**
     You can also set up a custom shortcut or alias in your terminal to open IDLE from the desired directory. For example, add the following to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:
     ```sh
     alias idle='cd /path/to/your/directory && idle'
     ```

I'm glad to hear that others are facing this issue as well. It's reassuring to know that it's not just me.
