Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and FSNamesystem components of a distributed file system receiving and storing blocks of data. DataXceiver is receiving blocks from various sources, PacketResponder is terminating, and FSNamesystem is updating the blockMap with the source, block ID, and size of the data.
