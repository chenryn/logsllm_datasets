### Evaluation Criteria for Completeness of Vision

#### Market Understanding
- **Definition**: The vendor's ability to understand and address buyers' wants and needs, translating them into products and services. Vendors with the highest degree of vision not only listen to and understand these needs but also enhance them with their own insights.
- **Weighting**: High

#### Marketing Strategy
- **Definition**: A clear, differentiated set of messages consistently communicated throughout the vendor’s organization and externalized through its website, advertising, customer programs, and positioning statements.
- **Weighting**: Medium

#### Sales Strategy
- **Definition**: The strategy for selling products using an appropriate network of direct and indirect sales, marketing, service, and communication affiliates. This extends the scope and depth of market reach, skills, expertise, technologies, services, and the customer base.
- **Weighting**: Medium

#### Offering (Product) Strategy
- **Definition**: The vendor’s approach to product development and delivery, emphasizing differentiation, functionality, methodology, and feature sets as they map to current and future requirements.
- **Weighting**: High

#### Business Model
- **Definition**: The soundness and logic of the vendor’s underlying business proposition.
- **Weighting**: High

#### Vertical/Industry Strategy
- **Definition**: The vendor’s strategy for directing resources, skills, and offerings to meet the specific needs of individual market segments, including vertical markets.
- **Weighting**: Not Rated (Not evaluated in this Magic Quadrant, as APM and observability tools typically cover multiple verticals in a similar manner.)

#### Innovation
- **Definition**: Direct, related, complementary, and synergistic layouts of resources, expertise, or capital for investment, consolidation, defensive, or pre-emptive purposes.
- **Weighting**: High

#### Geographic Strategy
- **Definition**: The vendor’s strategy to direct resources, skills, and offerings to meet specific geographic needs outside the “home” or native geography, either directly or through partners, channels, and subsidiaries, as appropriate for that geography/market.
- **Weighting**: Medium

### Quadrant Descriptions

#### Leaders
- **Description**: Vendors in the APM and Observability Leaders quadrant provide products that are a strong functional match to general market requirements and have been among the most successful in building and expanding their customer base. They offer comprehensive portfolios with superior application visibility and broad integration with other IT operations management (ITOM) technologies. Leaders demonstrate evidence of superior vision and execution for emerging and anticipated market requirements, along with a consistent track record of innovation and customer experience.

#### Challengers
- **Description**: Vendors in the APM and Observability Challengers quadrant have broad market reach and large deployments. They typically have strong execution capabilities and a significant sales and brand presence, often garnered from the company as a whole. Some vendors may be transforming their product offerings and market focus, and their APM offerings are often positioned as elements of a larger solution that may extend beyond ITOM.

#### Visionaries
- **Description**: Vendors in the APM and Observability Visionaries quadrant provide products and have built a compelling plan to competitively address APM suite market requirements. However, their product portfolio may still be a work in progress. They have a lower ability to execute than the Leaders, typically due to a lower ability to respond to market conditions, bring together necessary product and platform requirements, and effectively gain and expand on market share.

#### Niche Players
- **Description**: Vendors in the Niche Players quadrant primarily cater to specific audiences or have limited use-case support. They do not demonstrate equal depth across all core capabilities and typically do not meet the APM needs of the broader market. They may serve specific verticals, market segments, or geographic regions. These vendors may have a more-limited ability to invest in the necessary functional and sales and marketing capabilities to expand beyond their current focus. Inclusion in this quadrant does not reflect negatively on the vendors’ value in the markets in which they choose to compete.

### Context

#### An Expanded View of APM and Observability
- **Title Change**: The title of this research has changed to reflect the growing interest and adoption of observability in the domain of APM. Observability is the characteristic of software and systems that allows them to be "seen" and enables questions about their behavior to be answered. It enables organizations to analyze software and systems based on the signals they emit.
- **Distinction from Traditional APM**: Observability-centric solutions support an exploratory, analytics-driven workflow that may resemble business intelligence (BI) more than IT operations. Many Leaders provide powerful, AI-augmented APM that identifies and predicts pathologies quickly, alongside access to raw, high-cardinality telemetry and tools to explore and understand it.
- **Resonance Beyond IT Operations**: The term "observability" is resonating outside of IT operations, particularly with senior IT leaders and application owners. It allows for discussion of these concepts beyond the IT operations team, especially when referring to cloud-native architectures like microservices, containers, and container-orchestrators.

#### The Growing Integration of Security
- **Inclusion of Security**: This is the first year that security has been included as a component of the market. Historically, the domains of security and IT operations have worked in separate silos, even when using the same telemetry.
- **Recent Incidents**: High-profile security incidents, such as Log4Shell, have highlighted the importance of understanding not only application performance but also the components and vulnerabilities they contain. APM tools and agents, already deployed across critical applications, can identify and block exploitable vulnerabilities. Some customers found that APM-based RASP identified vulnerable applications more quickly than their vulnerability management solutions.
- **Future Collaboration**: While an application performance and security monitoring (APSM) market is unlikely, the growing overlap and similarity of IT operations and security operations toolchains suggest more collaboration is inevitable.

### Market Overview

#### Market Growth
- **Continued Growth**: The continued growth in mobile, cloud-native applications, and workload migrations from traditional data centers to cloud architectures fuels the APM and observability market. Additionally, the adoption of APM tools has expanded in the following areas:
  - **Expansion within Existing Clients**: As APM products have evolved in capability, simplified deployment, accelerated time to value, and decreased in price, their utilization has increased in a larger percentage of applications.
  - **Expansion into Previously Untapped Industries**: APM and observability tools were traditionally found in large enterprises in industries like banking, finance, and global retail. Recently, as many industries undergo digital transformations, adoption has expanded into new areas such as government departments, healthcare, and manufacturing.

#### Market Trends
- **Holistic Tools**: Customer demand for more holistic tools where good-enough functionality in log management or infrastructure monitoring becomes part of a broader monitoring platform.
- **Contextual Data Viewing**: The need to view multiple data types in context without switching tools.
- **Alignment with Analytics**: APM tools will continue to become more aligned with analytics tools rather than data collection technologies, shifting the value proposition away from proprietary agents to more open and flexible data-ingestion platforms.
- **Expanding Use Cases**: APM use cases will expand beyond core IT operations to include SRE/cloud operations and DevOps, which are becoming important for understanding application performance across the entire stack and multiple IT teams.
- **SaaS and Cloud Services**: SaaS products and other cloud services present challenges to I&O teams. APM vendors are investing in capabilities to extend their monitoring to cover these environments.
