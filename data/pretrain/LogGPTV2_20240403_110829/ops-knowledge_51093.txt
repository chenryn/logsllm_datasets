User: When I press CTRL+F9 to run tests in Pydev, which interpreter does it use?
For example, I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 installed.
When I run scripts in the console by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter, a window pops up that lets me choose interpreter. But this does not happen when running tests.
Assistant: It'll be either the default interpreter (the top one at the preferences > pydev > interpreter) or the one that's configured for the project (if you select the project > alt+enter > pydev-interpreter/grammar you can let 'default' or select a different one).
After you've done a launch, you can go to run > run configurations and change it for the created launch.
