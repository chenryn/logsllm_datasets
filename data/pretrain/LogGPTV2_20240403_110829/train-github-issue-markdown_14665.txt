This is from julia-users. The example is:
    function g(a)
      if a
        f() = 2
      else
        f() = 3
      end
      return f
    end
    f = g(true)
    f() # Returns 3
What's also interesting is that g(false) in another REPL session gives an
error: "f not defined". So in this setup you either get the second function
(if you ask for the first one), or you get nothing! This is on Commit
