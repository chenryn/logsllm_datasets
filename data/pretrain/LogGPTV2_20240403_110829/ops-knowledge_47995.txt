User: I have a custom python logging working. I want to build a celery custom logging, based on workers. I went through the Docs but couldn find a hint. Anyone can suggest me one such method to do so?
Assistant: When you say you want different log files for each worker do you mean for each worker node or for each pool worker process? 
If it is for each node, that is already supported. Do celery worker --help for more info.

-f LOGFILE, --logfile=LOGFILE
                          Path to log file. If no logfile is specified, stderr
                          is used.

If you are using supervisord for running your workers, you can use stdout_logfile and stderr_logfile
If you want separate logfile for each pool worker process, can you explain why? Note that pool worker processes will keep changing if maxtasksperchild is set to limit the number of tasks executed by a process. You will need to figure out how you want to relate each worker process to a log file in this case.
