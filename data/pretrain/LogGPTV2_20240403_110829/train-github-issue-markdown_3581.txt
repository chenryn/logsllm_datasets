##### Detailed description
When compiling OpenCV I ran into the following error:
    Scanning dependencies of target opencv_videoio

    /home/ruben/Projects/Libraries/opencv/modules/videoio/src/cap_gphoto2.cpp:32:10: fatal error: gphoto2/gphoto2.h: No such file or directory
     #include 
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So it's missing the header files for gPhoto2. However, CMake says that it
detects gPhoto2 to be present:
    --     gPhoto2:                     YES
Turns out that the problem was that I did have gPhoto2 present on my system,
but not the development files that includes the header that OpenCV needs for
this module. CMake detected gPhoto2, but this was a false positive as I didn't
have the required files anyway. Installing Ubuntu's package for libgphoto2-dev
fixed the problem for me, because that put `gphoto2.h` on the include path.
##### Steps to reproduce
  1. Install all dependencies of OpenCV except gPhoto2.
  2. Install the Ubuntu package for `libgphoto2-6`, but not `libgphoto2-dev`.
  3. Build OpenCV using CMake.
##### Actual results
  * Error at 36% that `gphoto2.h` is not found.
##### Expected results
gPhoto2 should not be marked as found in the configure stage of OpenCV, if its
header files are not present. Furthermore, I'd expect one of these things to
happen, whichever you think is most common behaviour for OpenCV:
  * CMake disables whatever modules require gPhoto2 (videoio at least), or
  * an error is raised during the configure stage that not all modules can be built as desired.
