### Anomaly Analysis and Early Warning System

#### Anomaly Impact and Distribution
An anomaly was detected, but not all organizations were affected. Most organizations concluded that they were indeed impacted, though to a lesser extent than the average. Notably, Organizations 3 and 4 experienced a disproportionately strong anomaly in their networks. This requires a deeper investigation into why these specific organizations were more affected.

An analysis of the full port distribution and its entropy (plots omitted due to space limitations) revealed that affected organizations saw a sudden increase in scanning activity on specific high port numbers. The connections primarily originated from ports 80 and 443, which are commonly used as fallback ports by Skype. Additionally, a series of high port numbers indicated an anomaly related to Skype. For Organizations 3 and 4, some of the scanned high ports were extremely prevalent, with a single destination port accounting for 93% of all flows at the peak rate. Furthermore, most of the anomalous flows within these organizations targeted a single IP address and originated from thousands of distinct source addresses, connecting repeatedly up to 13 times per minute. These patterns suggest that the two organizations host popular supernodes, attracting a significant amount of traffic to specific ports. In contrast, other organizations mainly hosted client nodes and experienced uniform scanning. Organization 2 had banned Skype entirely.

Based on this analysis, organizations can take appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of the 2-day outage, such as notifying users or blocking specific port numbers.

#### Early Warning System
We also investigated the potential for building an early-warning system for global or large-scale anomalies using an aggregate view. The Skype anomaly did not start simultaneously across all locations due to varying Windows update policies and reboot times. We measured the lag between the time the Skype anomaly was first observed in the aggregate view and the local view of each organization. Table 3 lists the organizations that experienced a considerable lag, defined as over one hour. Notably, one of the most affected organizations (Organization 6) could have been alerted almost a day in advance. However, as shown in Figure 11, for Organization 2, this would have resulted in a false positive alarm. To maximize the benefits of such an early warning system, the aggregate view should be annotated with additional information, such as the number of affected organizations and the type of services involved. Our event correlation protocol is useful for determining whether similar anomaly signatures are observed in participating networks. Anomaly signatures can be extracted automatically using advanced techniques [8, 33].

| Organization | Lag [hours] |
|-------------|-------------|
| 3           | 1.2         |
| 5           | 2.7         |
| 6           | 23.4        |
| 7           | 15.5        |
| 13          | 4.8         |
| 17          | 3.6         |

### Related Work

#### Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)
Roughan and Zhang [37] first proposed the use of MPC techniques for various applications related to traffic measurements, including the estimation of global traffic volume and performance metrics [36]. They also identified that MPC techniques can be combined with common traffic analysis methods and tools, such as time-series algorithms and sketch data structures. Our work extends their research by introducing new MPC protocols for event correlation, entropy, and distinct count computation, and by implementing these protocols in a ready-to-use library.

#### Data Correlation Systems
Data correlation systems that provide strong privacy guarantees achieve data privacy through partial data sanitization using bloom filters [44] or cryptographic functions [26, 24]. However, data sanitization is generally not a lossless process and thus imposes a tradeoff between data privacy and utility.

Chow et al. [12] and Applebaum et al. [1] avoid this tradeoff by using cryptographic data obfuscation. Chow et al. proposed a two-party query computation model for privacy-preserving querying of distributed databases. Their solution includes three entities: the randomizer, the computing engine, and the query frontend. Local answers to queries are randomized by each database, and the aggregate results are derandomized at the frontend. Applebaum et al. present a semi-centralized solution for collaboration among many participants, dividing responsibility between a proxy and a central database. The proxy obliviously blinds the clients' input, stores blinded keywords along with non-blinded values in the central database, and unblinds the respective keywords upon request. SEPIA, in contrast, does not rely on two central entities but supports an arbitrary number of distributed privacy peers, is provably secure, and is more flexible regarding the functions that can be executed on the input data.

### Conclusion
The aggregation of network security and monitoring data is crucial for tasks such as collaborative network defense and cross-sectional Internet monitoring. Privacy concerns often hinder such collaboration. In this paper, we explored the practical usefulness of solutions based on secure multiparty computation (MPC). We designed optimized MPC operations that run efficiently on large input data and implemented these in the SEPIA library, along with novel protocols for event correlation and multi-domain network statistics (entropy and distinct count). Our evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of SEPIA in realistic settings. With commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, near real-time operation is practical even with 140 input providers and 9 computation nodes. The basic operations of the SEPIA library are significantly faster than those of existing MPC frameworks and can be used as building blocks for arbitrary protocols. We believe our work provides valuable insights into the practical utility of MPC and paves the way for new collaboration initiatives.

### Future Work
Our future work includes improving SEPIA's robustness against host failures, dealing with malicious adversaries, and further enhancing performance, possibly using polynomial set representations. In collaboration with a major systems management vendor, we have started a project to incorporate MPC primitives into a mainstream traffic profiling product.

### Notes
1. We define near real-time as the requirement of fully processing an x-minute interval of traffic data in no longer than x minutes, where x is typically a small constant. For our evaluation, we use 5-minute windows.
2. For instance, if n = 10 and Tc = 7, each event that needs to be reconstructed according to (4) must be reported by at least one of the first 4 input peers. Hence, it is sufficient to compute the Cij and Wij for the first n − Tc + 1 = 4 input peers.
3. When run on a 32-bit platform, up to twice the CPU load was observed, with similar overall running time. This difference is due to shares being stored in long variables, which are more efficiently processed on 64-bit CPUs.
