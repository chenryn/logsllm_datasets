User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it worth sending abuse mail? I have been running my own e-mail server for a while, and I noticed that scanning for open relays has been on the rise during the last days.
So I whipped up a little script that parses postfix logs, isolates "hostile" IP addresses, finds the ISP abuse contact and sends an appropriate e-mail to them with the relevant log entries.
I just let them know (nicely) that one of their clients is likely up to no good.

So far, about 30 e-mails have been sent, but no one has bothered replying so far (not even to say "thanks, we'll look into it"). I end up wondering: is it really worth notifying providers? Is someone actually reading abuse mail? Does he/she want to know about possible spammers on his network?

I don't really care about my server being scanned, it's just that I feel like I should do something to make the spammer's job harder.

Thanks in advance for your input!

Assistant: It depends on ISP approach of course. I have worked in the biggest polish Web Hosting company - we always did some action in case of abuse - of course we replayed and did some actions targeted to spamer. If it's spam, you can report these adresses to RBL list ;)
