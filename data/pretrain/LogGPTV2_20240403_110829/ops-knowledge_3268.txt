User: Is it possible to make a minimalistic operating system using Python?
I really don't want to get into low-level code like assembly, so I want to use a simple language like Perl, Python. But how?
Assistant: I suggest you find a good textbook on operating system design, and study that.  I'm pretty sure you won't find such a book with Python source code; C is more likely.  (You might find an older textbook that uses Pascal instead of C, but it's really not that different.)
Once you have studied operating systems design enough to actually be able to write an operating system, you will know enough to have your own opinions on what languages would be suitable.
