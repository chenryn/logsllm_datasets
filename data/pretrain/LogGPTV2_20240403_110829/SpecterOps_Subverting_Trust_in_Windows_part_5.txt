These Yara rules could certainly be tweaked to be slightly more targeted but upon initial inspection, of
the 6500 binaries/files returned, there appeared to be no malicious, fully-implemented SIP or trust
providers other than a PoC malicious SIP developed by the author of this whitepaper.
Use of Signature Validation Utilities
By now, it should be clear that without first validating against trust subversion attacks, that signature
validation utilities like sigcheck, signtool, and Get-AuthenticodeSignature assume that the integrity of
the trust validation mechanisms has not been subverted. Therefore, as any threat hunter and DFIR
practitioner should know, using a single analysis tool/methodology to classify something as benign,
especially on a system that is assumed to be compromised, is insufficient. If signature validation tools
are to be used on a system assumed to be compromised, it would be best to validate that SIP and trust
provider registry keys have not been altered in addition to performing offline reputation validation of
their respective DLLs by calculating their file hashes.

Security Vendor Guidance
Security product developers should consider the following when building trust subversion attack
mitigations/detections:
1. Identify calls made to WinVerifyTrust in your codebase. If the user-mode trust architecture in
Windows is relied upon, ensure that registry keys have not been hijacked and that reputation
has been established for SIPs and the trust providers your code relies upon.
2. As has been stated previously, a trust hijack attack can serve as a means of getting code
execution in the context of code that calls WinVerifyTrust. One of the most effective means of
preventing untrusted DLLs from being loaded into your process is to register an ELAM driver and
run your product as a protected service. As was mentioned previously, any attempted loads into
a protected process will be prevented and generate a Microsoft-Windows-
CodeIntegrity/Operational log 3033 event.
3. Alert upon any change to SIP or trust provider registry keys.
4. Any signed code for which a signature does not validate should be treated as if it is not signed.
5. Non-Microsoft binaries that implement any of the following APIs should be treated with
additional suspicion:
a. CryptSIPAddProvider
b. CryptSIPRemoveProvider
c. CryptSIPLoad
d. CryptSetOIDFunctionValue
e. CryptRegisterOIDFunction

Known Good SIP and Trust Provider Registrations
The following is a non-exhaustive list of known SIPs, trust providers, and their implementing DLLs (files
paths removed)/functions. These should be used as a reference point for baselining normal in your
environment.
