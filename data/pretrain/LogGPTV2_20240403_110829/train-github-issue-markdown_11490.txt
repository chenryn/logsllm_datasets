## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
```bash
/opt/Cranberry/venv/bin/celery multi start worker1 --workdir=/opt/Cranberry/ --app=Cranberry
```

## Expected Behavior
The `celery multi start` command should work in other directories when the `--workdir` option is passed.

## Actual Behavior
After upgrading to 5.0.1 from 4.x, the `celery multi start` command stopped working when not running from the `workdir`, even with the `--workdir` option passed. The daemon service could not start as a result.

Error from the command:
```
Error: Invalid value for '-A' / '--app': Unable to load celery application. Module 'cranberry' has no attribute 'celery'
> worker1@ip-10-0-5-210.ec2.internal: * Child terminated with exit code 2 FAILED
```

I inserted `print('Workdir: ', workdir)` at `celery/celery/bin/celery.py` line 123, and it prints:
```
Workdir: None
```

Further debugging shows that `multi` ends up calling a subprocess with `celery --app=Cranberry worker --workdir=/opt/Cranberry/ ...`. The command goes to `celery.bin.celery.APP.convert`.

I tried to print `ctx.params` there and noticed that the `--workdir` parameter only shows up when it is before `--app` in the command:
```bash
(venv) $ celery --app=Cranberry --workdir=/opt/Cranberry/ worker
app convert: Cranberry {}
Usage: celery [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
Error: Invalid value for '-A' / '--app': Unable to load celery application. The module Cranberry was not found.

(venv) $ celery --workdir=/opt/Cranberry/ --app=Cranberry worker
app convert: Cranberry {'workdir': '/opt/Cranberry/'}
Usage: celery [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
Error: Invalid value for '-A' / '--app':
```

The `--workdir` parameter does not seem to be used in `os.chdir` or passed to `find_app`.

Any help on this is much appreciated!
