**Current Behavior**
I have implemented the following code to set the locale:

```typescript
import { LOCALE_ID } from '@angular/core';

{ provide: LOCALE_ID, useValue: 'en-CA' }
```

However, `console.log(new Date().toLocaleDateString())` still outputs the date in the format `yyyy-m-d`.

**Expected Behavior**
The date should be formatted according to the `en-CA` locale.

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions**
You can reproduce the issue using this [Plunker example](https://plnkr.co/edit/ulSNTMTMZmORzvkVTvch?p=preview).

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior**
I need to change the date formatting to match the `en-CA` locale.
