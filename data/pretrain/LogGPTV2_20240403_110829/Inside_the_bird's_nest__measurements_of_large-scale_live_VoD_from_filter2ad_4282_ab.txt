### The Three Largest Content Providers

The three primary sources of Olympic video content are the official Olympics video website (Oﬀ), the largest social networking site in China (Soc), and the official Olympics video syndication site (Synd). Table 1 summarizes the key aspects of these providers, which differ in two main areas: business models and content presentation.

#### Business Models

- **Oﬀ**: This platform provided traditional video services to users across China. It featured a wide range of content, including full-time games, highlights, interviews, and online commentaries.
- **Soc**: In addition to portal services such as news, entertainment reports, and blogs, Soc offered specialized services for its user base, including instant messaging and online games. Unlike Oﬀ, Soc did not embed advertisements at the start of videos.
- **Synd**: This site was not directly accessible to the public. Instead, it was used by approximately 174 other websites across China, with most of its users coming from these partner sites. Both Synd and Oﬀ embedded advertisements at the beginning of their videos.

#### Content Presentation

- **Oﬀ**: Offered a diverse array of videos, ranging from a few seconds to several hours in length. Videos were typically released within 45 minutes after the respective events. The platform provided around 13,700 videos, including full games, highlights, interviews, and commentaries.
- **Soc**: Released about 20,000 video contents, primarily short clips, with most videos being under 5 minutes long. The platform did not include embedded advertisements.
- **Synd**: Provided significantly less content compared to Oﬀ and Soc, serving around 30 different highlights and game fragments each day, each under 5 minutes long. These videos were updated daily.

### Navigation and User Experience

- **Oﬀ**: Featured well-organized navigation capabilities, including sitemaps, event categories, and search features. The video player also provided thumbnails of related videos to guide viewers.
- **Soc**: Offered similar navigation features and used client software to engage users through instant messages. However, it did not provide links to related videos.
- **Synd**: The navigation and presentation features were limited by the capabilities of the 174 websites that linked to it, and detailed information on these features is not available.

### Data Collection and Processing

Each Flash Media Server (FMS) generated an access log tracking server and user actions. Logs were collected from all edge FMS servers between August 6th and August 31st, 2008, during the Olympic Games. Each FMS server reported logs every 15 minutes, which were then merged daily.

#### Access Log Analysis

- **Log Entries**: More than 3.5 million unique clients accessed over 34,000 video files, generating approximately 170 million lines of log data.
- **State Machine Model**: A simple state machine model was developed to capture user actions, involving five primary actions: connect-pending, connect, play, stop, and disconnect.
- **Session Definition**: A session started with the "play" action and ended with a "stop" action, with various operations in between.

### Summary Statistics

Table 3 provides a summary of the access logs. Over 3.5 million unique clients established around 18 million connections and accessed over 34,000 video files in 20.4 million sessions. The VoD system used dedicated FMS servers for each provider, allowing classification of events based on the specific content provider.

### Understanding Live VoD

#### Video Lengths

- **Live VoD**: Video lengths ranged from a few seconds to several hours, influenced by the nature of the events and the segmentation of longer events into smaller videos for near real-time delivery.
- **Traditional VoD**: Typically, video lengths are more uniform, with TV episodes lasting 30-60 minutes and movies 90-120 minutes.
- **UGC Sites**: Most videos on platforms like YouTube are under 600 seconds.

Figure 5 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of video lengths for the three providers. For example, 70% of Oﬀ's videos are under 1000 seconds, while Soc's 80th percentile is around 300 seconds.

#### Temporal Access Patterns

- **Daily Accesses**: Figure 6 shows the total number of videos accessed per day, with peaks on August 8/9 and August 18. The opening ceremony on August 8 and the withdrawal of Chinese athlete Liu Xiang on August 18 were significant events.
- **Hourly Accesses**: Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show time-of-day effects, with peak traffic around 10 PM. Some hours showed sharp spikes, indicative of flash crowd behavior.
- **Rush Hour**: Figure 8 illustrates the proportion of daily accesses contributed by the rush hour, with some days showing up to 17.6% of total accesses occurring in a single hour.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the characteristics of Live VoD, highlighting the unique patterns in video lengths, temporal access patterns, and the evolution of content popularity over time. These findings offer valuable information for understanding and optimizing video delivery systems for live and on-demand content.
