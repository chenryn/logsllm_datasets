### Timing Requirements and System Performance
The system met the timing requirements of the plant engineers and was even able to reflect changes more quickly than the commercial system.

### VI. Lessons Learned
Our experience in deploying an intrusion-tolerant SCADA system yielded valuable lessons in three key areas: technical insights, lessons from the red team experiment and deployment, and long-term lessons for transitioning this technology in the power industry.

#### A. Technical Lessons
1. **Low-Level Setup**:
   - The detailed low-level setup described in Section III-B is often overlooked in academic papers but is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of sophisticated intrusion-tolerant protocols. If an attacker can bypass these protocols at a lower level, they can undermine the assumptions on which the protocols are based.
   - Our red team experience highlighted that the network is a major attack vector. Low-level network attacks, such as man-in-the-middle and denial of service, do not require specific protocol or domain knowledge and are common tactics used by experienced hacker teams. The red team's initial attacks were focused on these low-level vulnerabilities. Without the robust network setup (including switch configuration and the use of two separate networks with a PLC proxy), the red team would likely have succeeded in causing a denial of service.
   - At the operating system level, porting all system components to the latest minimal CentOS server version was critical in preventing the red team from easily escalating their privileges once they gained access to one of the replicas.

2. **Defense-in-Depth**:
   - We learned that we could improve our code compilation and execution practices to make it more difficult for attackers. For example, compiling the code without debugging symbols would increase the time required for the red team to execute their exploits. Additionally, specifying options through command-line parameters and configuration files made it easier for the red team to understand the running processes; embedding these options into the program would have made information gathering more challenging.

#### B. Lessons for Successful Red Team and Deployment
1. **Preparation and Collaboration**:
   - Establishing rapport well in advance of the experiment is crucial. In previous red team experiments, a more open and collaborative approach was more effective. The physical separation of the red team in this instance, while realistic for modeling remote cyberattacks, limited our ability to interact and understand the exact attacks. In-person interaction could have enabled a wider range of protocol-specific attacks and improved our understanding of the red team's methods.
   - Working closely with power plant engineers during the second deployment led to a mutually beneficial experience, enhancing both sides' understanding of how the technology integrates into real-world operations.

2. **Emulation and On-Site Development**:
   - The open-source SCADA ecosystem allowed us to effectively prepare for the experiment using emulation. Prior to the red team experiment, Spire had never been tested with a real PLC, but we were able to test the system end-to-end using OpenPLC to emulate PLCs on Linux.
   - Despite thorough preparation, both deployments required short-notice on-site development. Each deployment was an intensive two-week process, with the first week dedicated to setup, integration, and final development. These environments, including a national lab with restricted internet and phone use, and a power plant requiring protective personnel equipment, presented unique challenges.

#### C. Lessons for Transition in the Power Industry
1. **Complexity and Collaboration**:
   - The power plant deployment underscored the complexity of modern power grid monitoring and control systems. Unlike a single monolithic SCADA system, the power plant included several distinct subsystems for generation and transmission. While our intrusion-tolerant SCADA system successfully controlled a small part of the transmission topology, more collaborative work is needed to understand the full power plant system architecture and design a holistic solution.
   - Given the conservative nature of the industry, an incremental transition approach is necessary to gain the trust of power grid operators and decision-makers. The participation of power plant engineers in the design of the red team experiment was essential in building their trust for the deployment, and this deployment is a first step toward the ultimate transition, although it will likely be a long process.

### VII. Related Work
Previous research has used intrusion-tolerant replication to create resilient SCADA systems, but to our knowledge, none have been tested by a nation-state-level red team or deployed in a power plant. Notable works include:

- Zhao et al. [4] used PBFT with four replicated SCADA controllers and demonstrated sub-second sampling rates in a simulated power grid scenario.
- Kirsch et al. [6] added intrusion tolerance to a Siemens SCADA product using Prime.
- Medeiros [5] proposed a fault- and intrusion-tolerant architecture for the EDP Distribuição SCADA system, leveraging knowledge of the Portuguese electric grid.
- Nogueira et al. [8] implemented SMaRt-SCADA, an intrusion-tolerant prototype integrating Eclipse NeoSCADA with BFT-SMaRt, addressing several challenges in traditional SCADA master support for intrusion-tolerant replication.

### VIII. Conclusion
We have shared our experiences in deploying an intrusion-tolerant SCADA system in a nation-state-level red team experiment and a power plant test deployment. These experiences provided technical lessons in supporting the assumptions of intrusion-tolerant protocols and employing defense-in-depth, as well as broader lessons for experimentation and transition in the power industry.
