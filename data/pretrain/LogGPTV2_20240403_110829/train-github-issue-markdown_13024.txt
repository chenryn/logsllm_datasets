We use an asset file to configure some feature inside our app.  
So during test, we tried to access to it but we keep getting this error.
    The getter 'buffer' was called on null.
      Receiver: null
      Tried calling: buffer

I know that assets are not available during test, but can you at least return
null if no assets ?
An other possibility would be to provide assets before test like
`tester.provideAsset(name, asset)`;
