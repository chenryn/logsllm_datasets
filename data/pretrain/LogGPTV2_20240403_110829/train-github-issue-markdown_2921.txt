I am very sorry for making dupl of #2753. But after closing this issue on 2
Jul 2015, there are a lot of compelling arguments from community for allowing
this feature.
I read this article with statement: _It is no longer possible to implement ng-
include..._.  
I only want to make sure that:
  * angular team is really not interested in supporting any "html template as data or as parameter" scenario (for incoming angular2 release candidate)
  * there cannot be provided any official workaround, avoiding to have single angular2 component for every product in catalogue, for every web page, for every eLearning exercise etc.?
