I apologize for the duplication of issue #2753. However, since this issue was closed on July 2, 2015, there have been numerous compelling arguments from the community in favor of allowing this feature.

After reading an article that states, "It is no longer possible to implement ng-include...," I would like to clarify the following points:

1. Is the Angular team genuinely not interested in supporting any "HTML template as data or as a parameter" scenarios for the upcoming Angular 2 release candidate?
2. Are there no official workarounds available to avoid having a separate Angular 2 component for every product in a catalog, every web page, and every eLearning exercise, etc.?

Thank you for your attention to these questions.
