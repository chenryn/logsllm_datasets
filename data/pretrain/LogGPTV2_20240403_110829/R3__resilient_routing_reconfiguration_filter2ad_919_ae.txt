Figure 7: Sorted performance ratio: Level 3.
FCP, and PathSplice reach at least 2.4 times of optimal, while MPLS-
ff+R3 and OSPF+R3 reach only 1.6; thus they are at least 50%
higher than R3 based protection.
Summary: For US-ISP, R3 based schemes consistently achieve bet-
ter performance than OSPF+recon, OSPF+CSPF-detour, FCP, and
PathSplice, outperforming them by at least 50% in all scenarios and
much higher in some scenarios.
Rocketfuel topologies: Next we evaluate using Rocketfuel topolo-
gies. For each Rocketfuel topology, we randomly generate one traf-
ﬁc matrix using gravity model. Due to lack of SRLG information,
we generate all two-link failures and randomly sample around 1100
three-link failures. We then evaluate the performance of different
algorithms under these failures.
Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the performance ratios for SBC and
Level 3, respectively. We choose these two topologies as they
give representative results among the Rocketfuel topologies. From
these ﬁgures, we make the following observations. First, on SBC,
MPLS-ff+R3, which jointly optimizes base routing and protection
299 
routing, signiﬁcantly out-performs all OSPF based algorithms, in-
cluding OSPF+opt. This demonstrates the advantage of joint opti-
mization of base routing and protection routing. Second, on Level
3, MPLS-ff+R3 and OSPF+R3 have very similar performance, and
consistently out-perform other OSPF based algorithms, except for
OSPF+opt. In fact, on Level 3, OSPF+opt performs very close to
optimal and slightly better than MPLS-ff+R3 and OSPF+R3. Re-
call that it is substantially more expensive to implement OSPF+opt,
this indicates that on networks with very good OSPF routing, R3 on
top of OSPF can be used to achieve most of the gains of R3 while
retaining the simplicity of OSPF routing.
Prioritized R3: We evaluate prioritized R3 using three classes of
trafﬁc with different priorities. Speciﬁcally, we extract trafﬁc of
TPRT and TPP from the US-ISP backbone trafﬁc in a peak inter-
val. For conﬁdentiality, we rescale the trafﬁc volumes of TPRT and
TPP. We then subtract these two types of trafﬁc from the total trafﬁc
and treat the remaining trafﬁc as IP. For prioritized R3, we set the
protection levels of TPRT, TPP, and IP to four failures, two failures,
and one failure, respectively. For general R3, all trafﬁc is protected
against one failure. We report results for all single failures, top
100 worst-case two-failure scenarios, and top 100 worst-case four-
failure scenarios out of the sampled four failures.
Figure 8 shows the normalized bottleneck trafﬁc intensities for
the three classes of trafﬁc under R3 with and without priority. We
make the following observations. First, both prioritized and general
R3 provide congestion-free rerouting under single failures. Com-
paring the performance between prioritized and general R3, we
observe that IP trafﬁc has lower bottleneck trafﬁc intensity under
prioritized R3 than under general R3, while the bottleneck traf-
ﬁc intensities of TPP and TPRT under prioritized R3 are slightly
higher than under general R3. The reason for the latter is because
even though IP trafﬁc has lower priority than TPP and TPRT under
multiple failures, prioritized R3 can give IP better treatment under
single failures as long as TPP and TPRT trafﬁc are well protected,
which is the case (i.e., the bottleneck trafﬁc intensities of TPP and
TPRT are always smaller than 0.4 under single failures). Second,
under two-link failures, prioritized R3 guarantees no congestion for
TPRT and TPP, whereas TPRT and TPP experience congestion un-
der general R3. The bottleneck trafﬁc intensities of IP trafﬁc are
higher under prioritized R3 than under general R3, which is in-
evitable due to limit of resources. Third, under four-link failures,
TPRT incurs no congestion using prioritized R3, whereas all traf-
ﬁc experiences congestion using general R3. Even TPP, which is
protected up to two-link failures, achieves lower trafﬁc intensities
under prioritized R3 than under general R3. As expected, IP trafﬁc
experiences congestion under both general and prioritized R3 dur-
ing four-link failures. These results demonstrate that prioritized R3
is effective in providing differentiation to different classes of trafﬁc.
Penalty envelope: Our R3 formulation introduces a penalty en-
velope on normal case MLU. The goal is to balance between be-
ing robust to topology changes and being optimal when there are
no topology changes. We demonstrate the importance of this tech-
nique by evaluating network performance under no topology changes.
In Figure 9, we show the performance of four algorithms: R3 with-
out penalty envelope, OSPF, R3 with penalty envelope, and opti-
mal. We pick a time period when OSPF performs particularly well
with optimized IGP weights. We make the following observations.
First, adding the penalty envelope signiﬁcantly improves normal
case performance. The 10% penalty envelope is effective and R3
performs within the envelope during normal operations. Second,
R3 without penalty envelope can lead to signiﬁcant performance
penalty in normal cases. Its normalized trafﬁc intensity sometimes
goes as high as 200% of the optimal and may perform even worse
than OSPF. The reason is that R3 without penalty envelope opti-
mizes exclusively for the performance under failures and only en-
forces no congestion during normal network topology and trafﬁc.

R3, which jointly optimizes base routing and protection routing,
out-performs OSPF+R3. So a better base routing leads to bet-
ter overall performance. To further understand the impact of base
routing, we conduct the following evaluation. We compare two
versions of OSPF as base routing: (i) OSPFInvCap+R3 and (ii)
OSPF+R3, where in the former the IGP weights of the base routing
is inverse proportional to link capacity and in the latter IGP weights
are optimized. As shown in Figure 10, R3 based on OSPFInvCap is
signiﬁcantly worse than R3 based on an optimized OSPF routing.
These results further demonstrates the importance of base routing.

tation complexity of R3. We run R3 ofﬂine precomputation for
