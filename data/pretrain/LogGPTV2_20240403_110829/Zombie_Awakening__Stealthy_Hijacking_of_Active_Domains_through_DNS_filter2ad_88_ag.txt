This is because resolvers may purge
cache periodically. In this measurement study, we are interested in
obtaining a high-level estimation about the lifetime of a poisoned
record.

Maximum TTL limit. Some resolvers set a limit on the maximum
TTL value they accept, which provides an estimate on how long a
poisoned A record can survive in the cache of the resolvers. Hence,
we measure the maximum TTLs of the affected resolvers. To this
end, we registered a domain and created 40 subdomains to test 40
affected resolvers (similar to our methodology in Section 4.3). The
TTL value for all subdomainâ€™s A record is set to be 604800 seconds
(i.e., one week), the maximum TTL limit for most resolvers [42].
Then each resolver is queried to achieve the returned TTL value.
Table 5 shows the returned TTLs. As the resolvers from the same
operator share the same returned TTLs, except for Yandex DNS, we
present the value per operator. We observe the majority of the tested
resolvers accepts the set TTL value (i.e., 604800 seconds), while
resolvers operated by Clean Browsing and Quad9 accept smaller
TTL values, i.e., 86400 seconds and 43200 seconds, respectively. Note
that it is possible that a poisoned record was cleaned up from the
