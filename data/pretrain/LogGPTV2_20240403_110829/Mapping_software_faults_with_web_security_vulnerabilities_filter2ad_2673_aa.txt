1. Introduction
Most information systems and business applications
that are built nowadays (e.g. e-commerce, banking,
transportation, web mail, blogs, etc.) have a web front(cid:173)
end. They need to be universally accessed by clients,
employees and partners around the world as online
trading is becoming more and more ubiquitous in the
global economy. These web applications, which can be
used from anywhere, also become so widely exposed that
any existing security vulnerability will most probably be
uncovered and exploited by hackers. Hence, the security
of web applications is a major concern and is receiving
more and more attention from the research community.
However, in spite of this growing awareness of security
aspects at web application level [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], there is an
increase in the number of reported attacks that exploit
web application vulnerabilities. A recent
example
(August 17, 2007) of such attacks occurred in the
recruitment website Monster.com where 1.6 million of
personal records were stolen [6]. Numerous other data
breach attacks are frequently reported and many of them
are due to security problems in web applications [7, 8, 9].
According to an Accunetix [10] audit result, 70% of
the 3,200 websites scanned in the past three years contain
security vulnerabilities. The NTA Monitor's 2007 Annual
Security Report [11] states that online risks in financial
institutions have increased 16%, and 28% in publishing
companies. Overall, 32% of the websites analyzed
contain critical vulnerabilities that are widely known and
actively exploited by hackers. This confirms that
the
security problem in web applications is an issue far from
being solved and that software bugs that are responsible
for security vulnerabilities may have a devastating cost if
exploited by hackers. Although configuration and human
issues are also potential causes for vulnerabilities, the
root cause of most security attacks are vulnerabilities
created by software faults.

In this paper we look at 655 security patches that were
developed for different versions of six widely used web
applications. In order to characterize the types of faults
that are most likely to lead to software vulnerabilities we

Defect Classification (ODC) [12, 13, 14]. Every patch is

utmost importance to build a realistic attack injector, for
example. It may also be crucial for the development of
automatic static code analyzers that focus on finding
security vulnerabilities, for the specification of guidelines
for teams of security code reviewers, for the evaluation of
penetration test tools as well as for the creation of more
secure internal policies
for programming practices,
among others.

2. Classification of web application security
patches
In the present study we used six well know web
applications. These applications have a large community
of users and they are representative of a large spectrum of
web applications being used nowadays. The classes of
vulnerabilities analyzed have a critical importance as they
affect most of the web applications, not just those used in
this study.
The present study uses LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql
and PHP) web applications because they include the
technologies most
commonly used to build web
applications nowadays. LAMP software is free,
fast,
flexible, and has many libraries. Although there are other
to build web
widely used programming languages
applications, PHP applications have
an increasing
popularity nowadays. According to Nexen.net, PHP
represents around 33% of the market share [18] and is
widely adopted to build custom web applications, portals
for large community of users, e-commerce applications
and web administration tools. It is also used in many
large
(e.g. Google, Amazon, Digg,
Wikipedia, SourceForge, etc.) and e-government sites.
Nevertheless, this kind of setups is responsible for a large
number of reports of security flaws.
corporations
The two vulnerabilities analyzed by the present study
are the most critical
in web applications: Cross Site
Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (see [8] for details on
these vulnerabilities). Exploits of these vulnerabilities
take advantage of unchecked input fields at user interface,
which allows the attacker to change the SQL commands
that are sent to the database server (SQL Injection) or
through the input of HTML and a scripting language
(XSS).
[8]
released a report
The Open Web Application
Security Project
in 2007
(OWASP Foundation)
which listed the ten most critical web application security
vulnerabilities. It was based on data on vulnerability type
distributions in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE!) provided by Mitre Corporation [9]. According to
this report, XSS is the most critical vulnerability (18.5%),
followed by SQL injection (13.6%). Together they are
responsible for approximately one third of all the CVE in
2006. The popularity of these attacks is related to: a) the
easiness in finding and exploiting such vulnerabilities; b)
the importance of the assets they can disclose; and c) the
level of damage they may inflict. In fact, SQL injection
and XSS allow attackers to access unauthorized data
(read, insert, change or delete), gain access to privileged
database accounts, impersonate another user (such as the
administrator), mimic web applications, deface web
pages, obtain access to the web server, etc.

the problem releasing
application updates or patches. These patches correcting
vulnerabilities were used in our study to understand
which code is responsible for security problems. With
this approach we can classify the code that caused real
security flaws.
For each web application tested, the methodology to
classify the security patches is the following:
1) Verification of the patch to confirm if the version of
the web application is available.
2) Analysis of the code with the vulnerability and of the
code after being patched.
3) Classification of each code fix that is found in the
patch. To be accurate, we followed some rules as
described in section 2.4.
4) Loop through the previous steps until all available
patches of the web application are analyzed.

gap between statistical defect models and the causal
analysis. The underlying idea is that knowing the root
cause of software defects helps in removing their source,
therefore contributing to the improvement of software
quality [19]. In the present study we are only dealing with
code defects, therefore we only use the ODC defect types
that are directly related to the code. These defect types

The five classes of ODC fault types are too broad and
they do not have enough detail for the precision needed
by the present field study. We need to analyze the code
from the point of view of the software programmer, so

nature of the defect [14]: missing construct; wrong

the security vulnerabilities collected can be
classified using the 11 fault types already identified in
[14] and one extra fault type (MFC extended). They are
presented in Table 1, where their correlation with the
original ODC types is also shown. We defined the MFC
extended fault type because there was one typical defect
that could not be classified according to the fault types
defined by Duraes [14]. The MFC extended is based on
the missing function call (MFC) fault type. The MFC can
only be used if the return value of the function is not used
elsewhere in the code. However,

programming there are lots of security problems because
of missing functions whose purpose is to sanitize a
variable. The return of these functions is the variable
sanitized that will be used in the code. As this important
fault type can not be classified using the original MFC we
removed the restriction and created a new type named
"MFC - Missing function call extended".
2.2. Web applications analyzed
One mandatory condition for this field study is the
availability of the source code of the web applications
under analysis. The code of previous versions and the
associated security patches must also be accessible. The
other mandatory condition is the presence of information
correlating the security fix and the specific version of the
web application.
For the present study we have selected six web
applications: PHP-Nuke [20], Drupal [21], PHP-Fusion
[22], WordPress [23], phpMyAdmin [24] and phpBB
[25]. These

automation system built as a community portal. The news
can be submitted by registered users and commented by
the community. PHP-Nuke is quite modular and custom
modules can be added to increase the number of features
available. PHP-Nuke is one of the most notorious CMS
and it has been downloaded from the official site over 8
million times [20].
WordPress is a personal blog publishing platform that
also supports the creation of easy to administrate web
sites. A Google search of WordPress pages using the text
"Proudly powered by WordPress", which is at the bottom
of WordPress based sites, finds over 7 million pages.
phpMyAdmin is a web based MySQL administration
tool. It is one of the most popular PHP applications and
has a very large community of users. phpMyAdmin is
available in 47 languages,
is included in many Linux
distributions and was the winner of the 2007 SourceForge
Community Choice Awards for Best Tool or Utility for
SysAdmins [27].
The web applications analyzed are so broadly used
that they have a large number of vulnerabilities disclosed
from previous versions, which are the subject of analysis
of the present field study (see Table 2). The number of
vulnerabilities is not constant among web applications
because the quality of the code and the number of
vulnerabilities publicly disclosed varies a great deal.
