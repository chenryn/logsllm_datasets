intermediate certiﬁcate has signed 26% of currently valid HTTPS
certs. If the private key for this intermediate authority were com-
promised, 26% of websites that rely on HTTPS would need to be
immediately issued new certiﬁcates. Until these websites deployed
the new certiﬁcates, browsers would present certiﬁcate warnings for
all HTTPS communication. While it is not technically worrisome
that a small number of organizations control a large percentage
of the CA market, it is worrying that large CAs are not following
simple precautions and are instead signing a large number of leaf
certiﬁcates using a small number of intermediates.
5.4 Browser Root Certiﬁcate Stores
Microsoft, Apple, and Mozilla all maintain a distinct set of trusted
signing certiﬁcates, which we refer to as root authorities. Google
Chrome utilizes the OS root store in Windows and Mac OS and
utilizes the root store maintained by Mozilla on Linux. Combined,
the three groups trust 348 root authorities, but there are large discrep-
ancies between the root certiﬁcates trusted by each organization. For
example, as can be seen in Table 6, Windows trusts 125 additional
authorities that are not present in any other OS or browser.

Table 6: Differences in Browser and OS Root Stores — While
there are signiﬁcant differences in the root certiﬁcates stores, 99.4%
of trusted certiﬁcates are trusted in all major browsers.
The differences in the root stores lead to 463 partially trusted
CAs. All but a small handful of the partially trusted authorities
belong to government, regional, or specialty issuers. Only one of
the partially trusted CAs, ipsCA, advertised itself as a commercial
authority and sold certiﬁcates to the global market. Incidentally, the
company claims to be “recognized by more than 98% of today’s
desktops” [2]. It fails to mention that its certiﬁcates are not trusted
in Mozilla Firefox or on Mac OS.
Further investigation indicates that ipsCA was in the Mozilla root
store in 2009, but was removed after several violations including
the issuance of embedded-null preﬁx certiﬁcates, the unavailability
of OCSP servers, and the issuance of leaf certiﬁcates with validity
periods beyond the lifetime of the root CA certiﬁcate [34].
These 463 partially trusted authorities have little presence on the
Internet. In total, they have signed certiﬁcates for only 51 domains in
the Alexa Top 1 Million and for one domain in the Alexa Top 10,000
which belongs to mci.ir, an Iranian telecommunications company.
Of the 348 root certiﬁcates, 121 of the authorities never signed any
leaf certiﬁcates seen in our study, and 99.4% of the leaf certiﬁcates
trusted by any browser are trusted in all browsers.
5.5 Name Constraints
While it is not an inherently poor idea to provide signing cer-
tiﬁcates to third-party organizations, these certiﬁcates should be
restricted to a limited set of domains. Instead, all but 7 CAs in
our March 22 scan can sign for any domain. X.509 Name Con-
straints [18] provide a technical mechanism by which parent au-
thorities can limit the domains for which an intermediate signing
certiﬁcate can sign leaf certiﬁcates. Optimally, signing certiﬁcates
provided to third-party organizations, such as universities or corpo-
rations, would utilize name constraints to prevent potential abuse
and to limit the potential damage if the signing certiﬁcate were
compromised.
We ﬁnd that only 7 trusted intermediate authorities out of 1,832
have name constraints deﬁned, of which 3 were labeled as Comodo
testing certiﬁcates. The remaining 4 are:
1. An intermediate provided by AddTrust AB to the Intel is
limited to small a number of Intel owned domains.
2. An intermediate controlled by the U.S. State Department and
provided by the U.S. Government root authority is prevented
from signing certiﬁcates with the .mil top-level domain.
3. An intermediate provided to the Louisiana State University
Health System is limited to a small number of afﬁliated do-
mains.
4. A root certiﬁcate belonging to the Hellenic Academic and
Research Institutions Certiﬁcation Authority is restricted to
the .gr, .eu, .edu, and .org domains.
5.6 Path Length Constraints
A signing authority can limit the number of intermediate authori-
ties that can appear below it in a certiﬁcate chain by specifying an
X.509 path length constraint [18] on the intermediate certiﬁcates that
it signs. This is frequently used to prevent intermediate authorities
from further delegating the ability to sign new certiﬁcates.
In our dataset, we ﬁnd that 43% of signing certiﬁcates do not have
any path length restriction deﬁned. While this may not be a concern
for large commercial CAs, we note that more than 80% of the
intermediate authorities belonging to other types of organizations
(e.g. corporations, academic, and ﬁnancial institutions). While
we saw little evidence of non-commercial CAs providing signing
certiﬁcates to third-party organizations, we did observe governments
using their intermediate authority to sign subordinate CA certiﬁcates
for corporations within their country.
5.7 Authority Key Usage
All of the browser-trusted leaf certiﬁcates in our study were signed
using an RSA key. As shown in Table 8, over 95% of browser
trusted certiﬁcates were signed with 2048-bit RSA keys. We also
note 6 browser-trusted authorities with ECDSA keys belonging
to Symantec, Comodo, and Trend Micro. However, we found no
trusted certiﬁcates that were signed using a ECDSA certiﬁcate.
Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that 243 (13%) of the browser-trusted sign-
ing certiﬁcates were signed using a weaker key than they themselves
contained. In all of these cases, the weakest key was the root author-
ity. While only 58 (15.2%) of the 348 browser root authorities utilize
1024-bit RSA keys, these keys were used to indirectly sign 48.7%
of browser-trusted certiﬁcates. In all of these cases, the CA organi-
zation also controlled a browser-trusted 2048-bit root certiﬁcate that
could be used to re-sign the intermediate certiﬁcate.
NIST recommends that the public stop using 1024-bit keys in
2016 based on the expected computational power needed to compro-
mise keys of this strength [5]. However, as seen in Figure 5, more
than 70% of CA certiﬁcates using 1024-bit keys expire after this
date and 57% of roots using 1024-bit RSA keys have signed children
that expire after 2016. Figure 3 shows how certiﬁcate authorities are
using certiﬁcates valid for up to 40 years—far beyond when their
keys are expected to be compromisable. Most worryingly, it does
not appear that CAs are moving from 1024-bit roots to more secure
keys. As shown in Figure 4, we ﬁnd only a 0.08% decrease in the
number of certiﬁcates dependent on a 1024-bit root authority in the

past year. In 2012, 1.4 million new certiﬁcates were issued that were
rooted in a 1024-bit authority, and 370,130 were issued between
January and April 2013.
6. LEAF CERTIFICATES AND HOSTING
Over the last 14 months, we collected 6.93 million unique trusted
certiﬁcates. In our March 22 scan, we observed 3.2 million unique
trusted certiﬁcates from 21.4 million hosts.
In this section, we
discuss the dynamics of these trusted leaf certiﬁcates and the hosts
serving them.
6.1 Keys and Signatures
Public Keys
In line with previous studies, we ﬁnd that over 99%
of trusted leaf certiﬁcates contain RSA public keys. We provide
a breakdown of leaf key types in Table 9. Over the course of the
past year, we found 47 certiﬁcates that contain ECDSA public keys;
none were present in our March 22 scan and none were browser
trusted. Recently, Google began to use ECDSA certiﬁcates for
several services. However, these sites are only accessible through
the use of server name indication (SNI) and so do not appear in our
dataset.
We ﬁnd 2,631 browser-trusted certiﬁcates using 512-bit RSA
keys, which are known to be easily factorable, and 73 certiﬁcates
utilizing 768-bit keys, which have been shown to be factorable with
large distributed computing efforts [20]. While a large number of
these certiﬁcates were found being actively hosted, only 16 have
not yet expired or been revoked. No browser-trusted authorities
have signed any 512-bit RSA keys since August 27, 2012. We
were further encouraged to ﬁnd that less than 4% of valid trusted
certiﬁcates used 1024-bit keys.
Weak Keys
Previous studies have exposed the use of weak keys
in the HTTPS space [16,22,35]. We revisit several of these measure-
ments and provide up-to-date metrics. Following up on the study
performed by Heninger et al. [16], we ﬁnd that 55,451 certiﬁcates
contained factorable RSA keys and are served on 63,293 hosts, a
40% decrease in the total percentage of hosts with factorable keys,
but only a slight decrease (1.25%) in the raw number of hosts found
using factorable keys since 2011. Three of the factorable certiﬁ-
cates are browser trusted; the last was signed on August 9, 2012.
2,743 certiﬁcates contained a Debian weak key [7], of which 96
were browser trusted, a 34% decrease from 2011 [16]. The last
browser-trusted certiﬁcate containing a Debian weak key was signed
on January 25, 2012.
Figure 4: Temporal Trends in Root Key Size — We ﬁnd that
48.7% of browser-trusted leaf certiﬁcates are dependent on 1024-bit
RSA based root authorities, contrary to recommended practice [5].
Figure 5: Expiration of 1024-bit Root Certiﬁcates — This ﬁgure
shows when trusted 1024-bit RSA CA certiﬁcates expire. We note
that more than 70% expire after 2016 when NIST recommends
discontinuing the use of 1024-bit keys.
Figure 6: CDF of Certiﬁcate Removal — We ﬁnd that 20% of
expiring certiﬁcates and 19.5% of revoked certiﬁcates are removed
retroactively (to the right of 0 days).
