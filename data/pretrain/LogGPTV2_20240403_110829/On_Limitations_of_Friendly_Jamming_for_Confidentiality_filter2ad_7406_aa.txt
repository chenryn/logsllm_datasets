Abstract—Wireless communication provides unique security
challenges, but also enables novel ways to defend against
attacks. In the past few years, a number of works discussed the
use of friendly jamming to protect the conﬁdentiality of the com-
municated data as well as to enable message authentication and
access control. In this work, we analytically and experimentally
evaluate the conﬁdentiality that can be achieved by the use of
friendly jamming, given an attacker with multiple receiving
antennas. We construct a MIMO-based attack that allows the
attacker to recover data protected by friendly jamming and
reﬁne the conditions for which this attack is most effective.
Our attack shows that friendly jamming cannot provide strong
conﬁdentiality guarantees in all settings. We further test our
attack in a setting where friendly jamming is used to protect
the communication to medical implants.
I. INTRODUCTION
The shared nature of the wireless communication channel
poses numerous security challenges, from eavesdropping by
a nearby attacker to selective interruption of communica-
tion by jamming. However, the physical layer of wireless
communications also enables novel ways to defend against
attacks. For example, wireless transceivers can collaborate
in order to prevent an attacker from interfering with, as
well as eavesdropping on, their communication. Recently,
a number of schemes were proposed in this space [1]–[7];
these schemes use the idea of friendly jamming—intentional
signal interference by collaborating and coordinated devices.
Friendly jamming is typically used to achieve the follow-
ing goals: (i) to prevent an attacker from communicating
with a protected device, and (ii) to prevent the attacker
from eavesdropping on messages sent by protected devices.
The ﬁrst goal is related to access control, authentication
and intrusion detection, and is typically achieved by a
friendly jammer who jams all trafﬁc to or from a protected
device [8]–[10]. The second goal is conﬁdentiality and is
achieved in this setting by exposing the attacker to friendly
jamming such that the attacker’s channel, unlike the channel
of the protected receiver, is degraded to such an extent that
successful decoding of messages becomes infeasible.
We focus on conﬁdentiality provided by friendly jamming
schemes. Although it might seem that the use of jamming for
conﬁdentiality is unnecessary because conﬁdentiality can be
simply achieved by encryption, there are numerous scenarios
where key distribution, performance, mismanagement, or
legacy issues prevent the establishment or use of shared
keys. One example is the case of medical implants, where
access to the implant data is safety-critical and must be
granted to medical professionals in all circumstances, even
in foreign domains to which appropriate credentials or keys
cannot be distributed [11], [12]. Another example is a
corporate setting where friendly jamming can be used as a
second layer of protection against unintentional information
leakage, mitigating the risk that misconﬁgured or legacy
systems do not use appropriate encryption [13]. Furthermore,
jamming can be used to protect initial key establishment, e.g.
in sensor networks [14].
Friendly jamming schemes that aim to achieve conﬁden-
tiality rely on the assumption that it will be hard for the
attacker to extract the message, as the jamming signal from
the friendly jammer and the signal carrying the conﬁdential
message superimpose at the attacker’s antenna(s). The signal
at the attacker’s antennas and thus his ability to extract
the message depends on many factors: the jamming and
message signals, the mutual distances between the jammer,
message source and the attacker, their locations as well
as the environment itself. Some related work on friendly
jamming assume scenarios where the attacker has limited
capabilities in terms of the number or directionality of his
antennas and antenna placement [1], [2], [15]. Other related
works such as [11], [16] do not assume an attacker that is
restricted in terms of the number of antennas but instead
argue that one can defend against a MIMO eavesdropper
or an eavesdropper with a directional antenna by ensuring
that the friendly jammer is located signiﬁcantly less than
half a wavelength from the data source. These works also
show that if the attacker is equipped with a single antenna,
proximity alone is not sufﬁcient for conﬁdentiality, but that
the ratio between the jammer and data source power is
equally a critical parameter. These arguments are based on
channel models and signal processing techniques commonly
used in wireless communication research. However,
the
effectiveness of friendly jamming has so far not been studied
in scenarios in which the attacker is equipped with multiple
antennas.
In this work we analyze friendly jamming in scenarios
where the friendly jammer and the message source are
physically very close (closer than half of the signal’s carrier

Figure 1. Two common friendly jamming scenarios. In both, the attacker A is jammed by J and is unable to eavesdrop on a message M transmitted by
the transmitter D. The legitimate receiver R can still receive the message. We differentiate between the scenario in which the data source (D) and friendly
jammer (J) are far (a) and when they are close (b).
wavelength), given an attacker with two receiving antennas.
We introduce a new type of an attack, based on MIMO, that
allows the attacker to recover conﬁdential messages from
distances sufﬁcient for a practical attack. We demonstrate
our attack both analytically and experimentally.
In our analytical evaluation, based on a Line-of-Sight
(LoS) model, we show that the attacker can recover the
conﬁdential message even when the friendly jammer and
the data source are few centimetres apart and the attacker is
several meters away.
Our experiments were done in the 402 − 405 MHz MICS
band. In our LoS experiments, the friendly jammer and the
data source were placed 15 − 30 cm apart (less than half a
wavelength for the MICS band). In this setting, we demon-
strate the successful recovery of conﬁdential messages by
an attacker from up to 3 m away, and in some cases from
further distances. In our NLoS measurements, we placed
the data source (a USRP) behind a layer of bacon and
ground beef, simulating a medical implant in human ﬂesh
and we positioned the friendly jammer within 5 − 7 cm of
the data source. In this setting we were able to recover
conﬁdential messages from distances of up to 2 m with
success rates depending on environmental conditions. The
above distances between the jammer, data source and the
attacker correspond to many practical settings. Our results
also raise security concerns with the use of friendly jamming
for the protection of conﬁdentiality of messages transmitted
by medical implants.1
1In our experimental results we shape the jamming signal power proﬁle
for the FSK modulated data that our data source uses. The works in [11],
[16] generate friendly jamming signal by combining multiple random white
Gaussian signals and by matching the shape of their power proﬁle to that
of the implant. In this work, we do not restrict the type of jamming signal
that the friendly jammer generates as our attack helps in eliminating the
jamming signal regardless of its type.
In this work we consider a relatively strong attacker,
who can place his antennas at chosen locations in the
vicinity of the victim’s system. Nevertheless, we believe
that in a number of scenarios, especially those where the
message source and the jammer are static (e.g., a patient
lies stationary during medical examination or a computer
that is used in an ofﬁce), this attacker model is practical. In
the case of a mobile victim, our attack can still be used to in-
termittently recover parts of transmitted messages, violating
the conﬁdentiality provided by friendly jamming schemes.
Note that since the transmitted messages are not protected
by any form of encryption, but that their conﬁdentiality is
typically solely protected by friendly jamming, the attacker
may be able to recover full messages even if he is able to
receive only individual message fragments.
Through our analysis and experiments, we demonstrate a
fundamental limitation of friendly jamming schemes when
they are used for conﬁdentiality and we reﬁne the conditions
under which such schemes can be used. Our results however,
do not pertain only to friendly jamming, but can also be
seen as a further reﬁnement of attacker models used in the
analysis of physical-layer security schemes—they highlight
again the importance of precise modeling of attacker’s
capabilities.
The structure of the paper is as follows. We give back-
ground information on friendly jamming schemes in Sec-
tion II. We then analyze the underlying model and assump-
tions in detail in Section III and show analytically under
which circumstances the attacker can eliminate the jamming
signal. We validate our ﬁndings experimentally in Section IV
and show that a practical attacker can remove the jamming
signals and recover the data. In Section V, we discuss the
impact of our ﬁndings and possible countermeasures. We
conclude the paper in Section VI.

II. BACKGROUND
In the context of conﬁdentiality, friendly jamming is used
in a scenario in which devices rely on a friendly jammer to
prevent the attacker from overhearing the messages that they
exchange. A typical friendly jamming scenario consists of
four parties: a transmitter, receiver, attacker and a jammer.
The jammer’s goal is to sufﬁciently degrade the channel be-
tween the transmitter and the attacker such that the attacker
cannot decode the messages coming from the transmitter.
However, the jammer must not prevent the receiver from
decoding the messages.
We differentiate between two types of friendly jammer
systems:
• Remote jammer systems. In these systems, the dis-
tance between the transmitter and the jammer is much
larger than half a carrier wavelength. Here, a common
security assumption is that the attacker is equipped with
a single omni-directional antenna and thus cannot sepa-
rate the conﬁdential message from the jamming signal.
However, in a number of scenarios, an attacker can
still try to use antenna directionality to his advantage
and extract the exchanged message. A remote jammer
system is illustrated in Figure 1(a).
• Nearby jammer systems. In these systems, the jam-
mer and the transmitter are less than half a carrier
wavelength apart. The main security assumption here
is that, in these systems, the jamming and data signal
envelopes are highly correlated ( [17] § 13.2.1) and are
thus assumed to be inseparable. We later show that this
assumption does not always hold. A nearby jammer
system is illustrated in Figure 1(b).
A. Friendly Jamming Schemes
Secrecy capacity [18] is a key notion in the information-
theoretic aspects of wireless security. It is deﬁned as the
difference between the capacity of the intended communi-
cation channel and the capacity of the eavesdropper channel.
Prior work discusses a number of ways of quantifying and
increasing the secrecy capacity bounds of various types
of wireless channels. Proposed systems rely on one or
more relay nodes [1]–[4], multi-antenna transmitters [19]
or friendly jammers [5], [6] to increase secrecy capacity
by enhancing the receiver’s and degrading the attacker’s
channel. Proposed systems considered a single [6] as well
as multiple friendly jammers [7]. All the schemes primarily
considered only remote jamming.
A common attacker model used in the analysis of these
schemes was based on a single, passive eavesdropper [4]–
[6], [20] and if resilience against multiple eavesdroppers was
considered, eavesdropper collusion was not made a part of
the model [1], [19].
Goel and Negi [21] consider the case of transmitter,
receiver and attacker all having multiple antennas. However,

Figure 2. The scheme proposed in [11]: To secure communication to the
implant, the patient wears an IMD shield. The shield (J) serves as a friendly
jammer and prevents all direct communication to an IMD and makes sure
that unauthorized devices (A) cannot decode messages transmitted by the
IMD. A programming device (P ) which wants to communicate with the
IMD has to ﬁrst establish a secure channel with the shield.
the total number of attacker’s antennas in their analysis is
less than or equal to the number of transmitting antennas.
Pinto et al. [22] consider a more powerful attacker. They
analyze the secrecy capacity in the presence of colluding,
spatially-separated eavesdroppers. Within their model, the
eavesdroppers are allowed to share and combine information
to improve their chances of successfully decoding a message.
The authors conclude that an increasing number of colluding
eavesdroppers drastically reduces the achievable secrecy
capacity.
Kuo et al. consider the problem of secure initialization
of nodes in sensor networks [14]. The proposed scheme
employs a Faraday cage in order to signiﬁcantly attenuate
signals which carry secret keying information. A friendly
jammer is placed outside of the Faraday cage to further
interfere with any potential eavesdroppers.
In the following, we describe a scheme that considered
the use of nearby jamming.
Gollakota et al. propose the use of nearby jamming to
to implantable
ensure conﬁdentiality and access control
medical devices (IMDs) [11].
In this scheme, a friendly jammer aims to protect an
“insecure” IMD, i.e., an IMD that does not implement any
security mechanisms. Without this protection, an attacker
could freely communicate with, as well as eavesdrop on,
data transmitted by the IMD. This would pose both safety
risks (malicious reconﬁguration of the device) and privacy
concerns (leakage of private information). To protect against
these attacks,
the user wears an additional device on a
necklace—the shield. The shield acts as a gateway for exter-
nal devices who want to communicate with the IMD—it will
prevent any direct external communication to the IMD by
jamming unauthorized queries of the IMD. In addition, the
shield will jam any transmissions from the IMD, preventing
anyone from eavesdropping on the message content. The
shield itself can cancel out his own jamming signal and
can thus correctly demodulate the data sent by the IMD.

Consequently, anyone who wishes to communicate with
the IMD must ﬁrst contact the shield, who then forwards
the communication to the IMD. Because the shield is an
external device, unlike an IMD, it can easily establish a
secure channel to any legitimate reader.
For an attacker with a single antenna, the scheme ar-
gues that given close proximity of the jammer to the
data source, sufﬁcient jamming power, and a well-formed
jamming signal, an attacker cannot recover the data signal.
To defend against an attacker with multiple antennas, the
work assumes that the respective channels of the IMD and of
the shield to the attacker cannot be separated with directional
antennas or techniques such as MIMO if the IMD and the
shield are signiﬁcantly less than half of the communication
signal wavelength apart. As reasoning for this, it refers to
Chapter 1 in [23] and Chapter 7 in [24] — these references,
however, do not explore the use of MIMO-like techniques
in adversarial settings. In the example of medical implants,
this work considers a distance of few centimeters, without
giving a precise threshold. In terms of the attacker, the only
other restriction that is imposed is that the attacker must
be located further away from the jammer than the implant
(e.g., at distances 20 cm and greater). The attacker is not
restricted in terms of the number, location, or directionality
