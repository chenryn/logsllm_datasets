phase we will pessimistically assume that a strike only on the GP bit still
results in an uncorrectable error. During the post-testing phase the SECDED
logic can ignore the error if GP indicates a mismatch and SEC syndrome is
zero (as this will happen either for a triple bit error or error only in GP, and
we do not expect 3-bit errors in the same line during the post-testing mode).

errors) then this line will be incorrectly regarded as a
fault-free line resulting in silent error, and we denote
such a line as a G- line.
Correctable Line (C Line): Indicates a line that has
an odd number of errors. If there is one bit error,
SECDED will correct the error, and we denote such a
line as a C+ line. However, if the line has more than
one errors then SECDED will cause miscorrection,
and the number of errors in the line would increase
by one, and we denote such a miscorrected line as a
C- line.
Detectable Line (D Line): Indicates a line that has an
either two or more error, and the syndrome and parity
mismatch. SECDED does not modify the contents of
a D line.

On a read access,
the two lines in the DMR pair are
sent through the SECDED circuit. We augment the SECDED
circuit to provide the line type as deemed by SECDED (G,C,or
D). This line type information is used to drive the detection
decision of FLAIR.
C. Detection Algorithm of FLAIR
FLAIR relies on two levels of error detection, as shown
in Figure 9. First, the status of the SECDED and second
DMR. The overall detection mechanism of FLAIR can be
tuned towards high robustness or more cache capacity. For
example, we can implement FLAIR in a conservative fashion
where DMR is performed only if both lines are estimated to
be G lines from SECDED. However, from Table II we observe
that 39% of the pairs are expected to have one error, therefore
this simple approach will discard almost one-third of the pairs
in testing mode.5 Therefore, we chose to have capability to
correct at-least one error in the pair. The detection algorithm
for FLAIR we employ is to rely on the DMR check only if
the pair has at-least one G line. Otherwise, the pair is deemed
as faulty, without the need to check DMR.
5The capability of correcting one error in each of the two lines is not as
essential as it has much smaller impact on capacity. This can be computed as
the product of: probability that the pair has two errors (prob=18%) and the
probability that both lines will get one error each (prob=50%), so a capacity
loss of 9% of the total pairs

only if SECDED estimates that at-least one line is a G line (in reality it may
be G- or G+).
D. Robustness of FLAIR to Multi-bit Errors
To assess the vulnerability of FLAIR to multi-bit errors, we
will consider case by case the number of of errors in a pair. To
separate the effect of mechanism robustness from bit failure
probabilities, we will divide the analysis into two parts. First,
we will compute the FLAIR Vulnerability Factor (FVF), which
indicates the probability that if a given multi-bit error event
happens, what is the likelihood that FLAIR will not be able
to detect it. We can multiply FVF to Raw Event Probability
(REP) (which will be a function of operating voltage) to get the
Event Vulnerability Factor (EVF) for that event. For analysis
with soft-error strike and miscorrection of SECDED, we will
be overly pessimistic in our calculations, and assume that these
events will always ﬂip the most vulnerable bit.
1)
2)
Pair has up-to 5 errors: FLAIR failure probability is
zero. FLAIR needs at least one line to be G- (which
needs at least four errors). If the pair has 5 errors, and
one line has four errors (for G-) then the other line
will have 1 error and SECDED will repair the line.
DMR will detect error between the corrected line and
the fault line. Thus, FVF for this case is 0.
Pair has 6 errors: Failure can occur if one line has
4 errors (G- line) and the other line has the two error
positions overlap. Then, if a soft error strike happens
in the position of third error, and it gets miscorrected
such that the new error is in the position of fourth
error. The probability that there is a (2,4) split of 6
errors is 30
64 , and the probability that the positions of
the two errors match can be computed6 as
523·522 .

6For a line with 512 bits, SECDED would require 11 bits, so the total
number of bits in the protected line is 523.

Thus, FVF for this case is 2−15.6.
Pair has 7 errors: To get a G- line, one line must
have four errors, therefore the other line must have
three errors. Failure would occur when the line with
3 errors gets miscorrected (or through a soft error
strike) into a line with 4 errors. The probability that
7 errors cause a (4,3) split is 70
128 , and the probability
that there will be overlap of the 3 three-error bits in
two lines is
523·522·521 . Note that for other splits such
as (5,2), DMR will be effective and thus avoid silent
error. Thus, the FVF for this case is 2−23.4.
Pair has 8 errors: Given that we need at-least one
G- line, one line must have either 4 or 6 errors.
A (6,2) split will be detected by DMR. Thus, the
vulnerable case is only when there is a split of (4,4).
The probability that we will get a (4,4) split in 8
errors is 70
256 . The probability that the errors in both
lines will overlap is
523·522·521·520 . Thus, the FVF
for this case is 2−33.
Pair has 9 errors: For failure there must be at-least
one G- line, so one line must have either 4 or 6 errors.
A (6,3) split will be detected by DMR. Thus, the
vulnerable case is only when there is a split of (4,5)
and the line with 5-errors gets changed to 4 bit-error
line, either by soft error strike or miscorrection. The
probability that we will get a (5,4) split in 9 errors
is 0.5. The probability that there will be overlap of 4
errors in both lines is
523·522·521·520 . Thus, the FVF
for this case is 2−33.
Pair has 10 errors: For failure there must be at-least
one G- line, so one line must have 4 errors and the
other 6 errors. The line with 4 error can get alpha
particle strike, making it seem like 5 errors which
could get miscorrected to the line with 6 errors. The
probability that we will get a (5,4) split in 9 errors
is 0.5. The probability that there will be overlap of 4
errors in both lines is
523·522·521·520 . Thus the FVF
for this case is 2−29.
Pair has 11+ errors: As these many errors in the line
is negligible to begin with (2−27 or less), we simplify
the calculations of these case by simply using a lose
upper bound on FVF. For these cases, we need at
120
24
120
least ﬁve error bits to have overlapping positions.
Given that the line (with SECDED) has 523 bits, this
probability is ≪ 2−20, if bit failure probability is <
0.5. So, we will use FVF ≪ 2−20.
The total failure rate of FLAIR mechanism can be esti-
mated by multiplying FVF with the raw probability that the
event will happen. For example, if the probability that the pair
has 8 errors is X and the EVF is Y then the contribution to
overall vulnerability from 8 error case would be X ·Y . Table III
shows the effective vulnerability of FLAIR. The effective pair
failure rate with FLAIR is 2−26.3 which meets our target for
the pair failure probability 2−25.7. Thus, FLAIR will be able
to provide a Vmin of 485mv, similar to ECC-8.
Note that we have made two severely pessimistic assump-
tions in our analysis. First, miscorrection always results in
match with faulty bit of the other line. Second, soft error strike
happens exactly in the position of the most vulnerable bit in
the line. Given the inherent likelihood of these events is low
(<< 0.2%), the Vmin of FLAIR in practice can be expected
to be lower than 485mv.
E. Vmin Comparisons
Table IV compares different ECC schemes with VS-ECC.7
and FLAIR. The Vmin of VS-ECC is limited by ECC-4 for
quarter of the cache (as the protected cache has only one-
fourth the lines, the Vmin is slightly lower than ECC-4 for
baseline cache). FLAIR provides a Vmin similar to ECC-8.
An important aspect to consider in these Vmin calculations is
that we assumed that for all schemes, except FLAIR, there
is alternative mechanism to handle soft-errors, and all the
available ECC is used only for tolerating hard errors. Reserving
one of the available ECC units to only tolerate soft errors
would increase the Vmin of these schemes (signiﬁcantly). The
analysis of FLAIR, on the other hand, already accounts for soft
error tolerance. Thus, FLAIR provides low Vmin as well as
soft error tolerance, while using only existing SECDED code.
While Table IV compares FLAIR to schemes that avoid
non-volatile fault map, we also evaluated FLAIR versus
7Table 3 of [2] shows VS-ECC obtains 500mv Vmin with cache line disable,
which incorrectly assumes that there are no errors in training phase.

schemes that rely on having non-volatile memory with faulty
locations stored. The most advanced (albeit complex) proposal
in this class is Archipelago [4]. We found that for failure rate
of Figure 2, and yield target of 99.9%, Archipelago tolerates a
bit failure rate similar to ECC-8.8 Thus, FLAIR obtains Vmin
similar to Archipelago without the need for non-volatile fault
map, while avoiding dual-line read on each cache access, and
obviating complex pairing of cache lines.

Operating Voltage (mv)
F. Operation During Post Testing Phase
tested,
FLAIR uses replication to provide robustness only during
the testing phase. As cache ways get
the testing
information gets stored in the line, and these ways become
available for normal use. Then, a pair of two ways that are
storing replicated information for one of the way are freed up
for testing. This procedure continues till the entire cache has
gone through the testing phase and ﬁnally there would be no
replicated ways in the cache. After the testing phase is over,
the cache operates similar to traditional cache with SECDED
and the lines with faults can simply be discarded. Read and
write operations in the post testing phase get satisﬁed by single
access at at the normal latency (without any latency overheads).
V. RECLAIMING DISCARDED LINES
Once the testing phase is over, the replication mode of
FLAIR is discontinued, the faulty lines identiﬁed during the
testing phase are disabled, and cache operates only with
reliable lines. Figure 10 shows the percentage of lines that have
exactly 1 error, or 2 or more errors as the operating voltage
is changed form 485mv to 540mv. At target Vmin of 485mv,
30.7% of the lines would have one bit of hard fault, and 9.3%
of lines will have two or more errors.
As our cache employs only SECDED we will need to
disable lines with 2+ errors. For lines with 1 error we can
use SECDED code to correct one bit error. However, the line
with single bit fault would then become vulnerable to soft
errors. For example, if such a line is struck by a soft error
then SECDED would be able to detect the error but not correct
it. Therefore, prior approaches [2] would recommend simply
disabling lines with even one bit fault. Unfortunately, that
would discard 40% of cache lines in normal mode at 485mv
operation.
Ideally we would like to have almost all of the cache
