own business as usual, planning your new life on Hawaii, it once again becomes abruptly
apparent that you have been the victim of one of those horrible online first amendment
crimes that you have a faint recollection of being the last thing to ever pass by the
original front teeth of that EFF guy. All of a sudden, your rights within the area of
speaking have apparently been radically cut down to the somewhat disappointing “right
to remain silent”, and you start wondering what the world has really come to? Well,
actually, you knew it would happen eventually, just like it happened to all great Internet
enterprises, the “unfair competition” lawsuit trick, the oldest trick in the book.
— Partial lack of anonymity/pseudonymity. People seem to somehow be able to get hold
of your real identity by suing your Internet identity, or otherwise reporting it to the police.
• 
Just returned from the week long visit “downtown”, you are starting to seriously consider
a small donation to the EFF, since installing that hard disk encryption software
mentioned in the blood stained pamphlet left by the EFF guy outside your door
seemingly resulted in a failure for your competitors to plant fake evidence of unfair
competition on your computer, or at least that’s your interpretation of the legal mumbo
jumbo that ended with “dismissed due to lack of evidence”. So it really worked then it
seems, those EFF people really managed to save your freedom of speech after all, and
they deserve a donation for it indeed! Being a responsible donor though, you always
make sure to check up on the financial activities and transactions of the organizations to
which you donate money. After all, you don’t want to have any part in sponsoring
something that would later turn out to be some kind of shady operation, right?
Incidentally, this would also be a great opportunity to try out that latest service offering of
your most fierce competitor in the area of Internet entrepreneurship, namely the Russian
Business Network. A service which they have given the disquietingly inventive name
“Get the bank account transaction listing of any given company or private person, for 10
cents”. Availing yourself of this service and having skimmed through the EFF account
transaction lists, you don’t notice anything out of the ordinary except one small oddity.
Two local chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous (which you conclude, from their initials,
must be the Rock Island and Menlo Park AA chapters) have repeatedly made some
pretty huge donations to key personnel at EFF, all of which have been immediately
“reimbursed” shortly thereafter on each occasion. Poor people you think, they must have

been drunk and mistyped the account numbers when transferring money from the local
chapters to the national organization. Naturally, being the Good Samaritan that you are,
you decide to take a quick peek at the individual account listings of these “RIAA” and
“MPAA” local chapters, just to insure they didn’t misplace any more of their money while
being under the influence lately. You quickly get to regret this thoroughness though,
when seeing that these poor fellows seem to have misplaced money transfers to
practically every single ISP board member, judge or politician involved in questions
concerning copyright and digital communications law in the whole of the United States
and Europe. That’s just too much, you say to yourself, it would take all night to note down
and report all those mistaken transactions. Those poor drunkards are on their own for
now. Damn, alcohol abuse is crazy, almost as crazy as all those policies and laws
proposed by the exact ISPs, politicians and judges being present on this transaction
listing, regarding data retention, blocking of traffic to arbitrary destinations, and release of
personal traffic logs to third-party make-believe cops owned by commercial interests. He-
he, isn’t that a funny coincidence you think to yourself, before finally registering your $10
donation to the EFF, which after all seems to be a bunch of some pretty standup guys,
having returned all those misplaced donations and everything.
— Full lack of anonymity, and subsequent invasion of privacy and abuse of personal
information by commercial interests and other shady authorities could soon pose a huge
threat to Internet users all around the world (as a result of misplaced AA money transfers
if nothing else).
So, can’t anything be done about this current and impending state of affairs?
Yes it can! In addition to donating money to charitable organizations (e.g. the EFF) that work
actively with helping “AA chapters” all over the world to stay away from their abuse, an efficient
way of removing the possibility for such privacy invasion and abuse would be to completely
remove the compromising link between a network information exchange and the network
identification details of the peers involved in such exchanges, i.e. the IP addresses of the
communicating peers.
This, combined with removing the possibility of eavesdropping on any part of the contents of such
information exchanges, would insure that no external party whatsoever could neither see who is
talking to whom, nor discover what they are talking about, be it the ISP itself or any other
organization tapping the wire at any given point along the communication path.
Oh, and about the danger of “over entrepreneurial” individuals (like our dear friend from the
examples above) exploiting this anonymity to commit serious crimes like those in the examples
above, don’t worry, this has been taken into consideration and taken care of in the design of the
protocol too, in one of the most clean and beautiful of ways possible.
And that, dear readers, is the definition of anonymity in the context of this paper.

3.  Further Definitions and Limitations
3.1.  Design Assumptions
Yet again, for a topic as multifaceted as this, some important assumptions on which the design is
based should be declared:
1.  The traffic of every node in the network is assumed to be eavesdropped on (individually, but
not globally in a fully correlated fashion) by an external party.
2.  Arbitrary random peers participating in the anonymization network/protocol are assumed to
be compromised and/or adverse.
3.  The protocol design cannot allow for any trusted and/or central entity, since such an entity
would always run the risk of being potentially forced offline or manipulated, if for no other
reason due to large enough quantities of money (or lawyers) being “misplaced”.
3.2.  Important Consequences of Design Goals and Assumptions
As a result of the design assumptions listed above, a number of consequences critical to the
design of the protocol can be deduced, out of which some important ones are:
1.  The protocol needs to be fully decentralized and distributed.
2.  No other peer participating in the protocol can be trusted by itself.
3.  Probabilistically secure algorithms need to be used instead of deterministically secure ones.
3.3.  Design Directives
During the course of any design procedure, one is often faced with different alternatives or
options at different levels. Design directives are meant to assist in making these decisions, and
also to make sure that all such decisions are made in a consistent manner, toward the same
higher level goals. The most important design directive for this project is:
1.  CPU power, network bandwidth, working memory and secondary storage resources are all
relatively cheap, and will all be available in ever increasing quantities during the coming
years and thereafter. Thus, wherever a choice must be made between better security or
better performance/lower resource consumption, the most secure alternative should be
chosen (within reasonable bounds, of course).

4.  Design Goals of the Protocol
4.1.  Complete Decentralization
In the world of IT security, it is a well known fact that however efficient, secure and robust a
system or protocol may be, if it has any kind of single weak point, this is what any determined
attacker will find and exploit. In cases of involvement by big financial and/or political interests, an
additional common angle of attack is the legal arena, where lawsuits, legal threats and
economical pressure are the primary weapons of choice.
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is to make sure that it has no central or single
weak points, neither in the IT realm, nor the legal realm. Because of this, the only viable option is
to make the protocol completely decentralized (including legal ownership wise, i.e. also making it
open source and community owned), dependent only on the sum of its users, while at the same
time not specifically on any single instance of them.
4.2.  Maximum Resistance against All Kinds of DoS Attacks
The current widespread trend of anti-privacy measures around the world is there for a reason. Big
commercial and political interests, and combinations of them, want to restrict and control the
privacy and free exchange of information on the Internet today. Considering the decentralized
nature of this protocol, combined with the fact that its primary purpose is actually to prevent the
tracking and targeting of single individuals on the basis of who they are communicating with and
why, the only practical way to attempt to stop it would be to launch destructive technical attacks of
different kinds against the network as a whole (attempting to outlaw its use altogether would of
course also be a theoretical possibility, which is discussed separately later in this paper).
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is to be resistant against such attacks, in the best
way possible, and this goal should therefore be considered through all levels of its design.
4.3.  Theoretically Secure Anonymization
As always in the field of security, any solution relying solely on the obscurity and practical
difficulty of cracking it, will always fail sooner or later. Usually sooner too actually, if just enough
motivation and resources exist among its adversaries.
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is that the security of its anonymity should be
theoretically provable, regardless of being deterministic or probabilistic.
4.4.  Theoretically Secure End-to-End Encryption
End-to-end encryption, and the subsequent prevention of anyone eavesdropping on the contents
of single communication sessions, is something that is normally taken for granted on the Internet
today. This kind of secrecy is also of extra importance when it comes to the field of anonymi-
zation, due to the simple fact that if someone is able to eavesdrop on the contents of the
communication between two otherwise anonymous parties, it is highly likely that information of
more or less identifying nature will occur at some point. In such case, the identities of the
communicating parties can be deduced by means of this information, instead of through network
specific address information.
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is to make sure that no entity other than the two
communicating peers of the protected conversation has access to its contents. Or, put in a
simpler way, the enforcement of end-to-end encryption.

4.5.  Complete (Virtual) Isolation from the "Normal" Internet
It is a well-known fact that people behave worse while under the cover of anonymity. Many
opponents of a protocol of the type being presented here would argue that the Internet is
sufficiently full of crime as it is today, and that increased anonymity would only be for the worse
(apparently not considering anti-privacy crime).
A big disadvantage with many existing anonymity solutions, e.g. TOR, is that they only provide an
anonymizing layer between their users and the normal, non-anonymous, Internet. This results in
a design containing “out-proxies” for the last communication step between the anonymization
layer and the normal Internet, which in turn has two substantial drawbacks. First of all, the traffic
of this last communication step is not necessarily encrypted, which enables any out-proxy to
eavesdrop on any such information (and as mentioned above, eavesdropping of communication
contents is not only a confidentiality risk, it is also a direct anonymity risk!). Second of all, the
users of such a system are essentially able to perform any action that normal non-anonymous
Internet users can, including most kinds of Internet related crime, such as spamming and unlawful
hacking. These types of crimes can always be traced back to the last “out-proxy” before the
switch to normal non-anonymous Internet traffic, and the person acting as this out-proxy (which in
a decentralized design would be any random user of the system) would run the risk of being
associated with the crime in question. Both these factors are of course at the very least
unpleasant, and would have a very discouraging effect on the usage of the system.
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is to make sure that none of its users should need
to worry about crimes being committed against other random Internet users from their own
computer, which is in turn accomplished by complete isolation between the anonymized network
and the normal Internet. This way, each and every user can decide exactly which services they
want to expose to anonymous access, considering the risks associated with doing so. For
example, if you don’t want to take the risk of anonymous hackers vandalizing your web server,
simply don’t expose it to the anonymous network. If you don’t want to take the risk of anonymous
users threatening you in a chat room, don’t join a chat room on the anonymous network. This way
(possibly even in combination with legal measures like EULAs and licenses for the protocol and
its implementations), no user of the anonymous network (let’s call this user “A”) should be able to
blame another innocent user of the anonymous network (let’s call this user “B”) for an anonymous
attack which just happened to bounce off user B as a last random stop before hitting user A.
Thus, no user of the network should have to worry about their participating role as a possible
routing node when using the network.
NOTE: Out-proxies from the Phantom protocol toward the normal non-anonymous Internet can
still be implemented on the application level, and hosted by anyone willing to take the risk. In this
case they could also easily be made target-specific, in order to e.g. allow for anonymous access
to your own website only, or similar.
4.6.  Maximum Protection against Protocol Identification/Profiling
Already today, several ISPs around the world have been exposed throttling or blocking traffic that
they either don’t themselves like, or even worse, that some commercial or political third-party
interests disapprove of and, thus, pressured them to block, all for a large variety of reasons. Due
to the fact that many of these parties in many cases are the very ones whose actions in the field
of anti-privacy this anonymization protocol aims to counteract, it is fair to assume that the protocol
itself would quickly become an attractive target for such measures.
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is to make positive identification of its use as hard
as possible for any third party with full external eavesdropping access to its traffic, in order to
prevent these same parties (e.g. an ISP) from being able to act upon this kind of information.
Let’s not kid ourselves however, traffic analysis is extremely hard to defend against to the extent
of it not being able to conclude anything. The practical goal will rather be to induce a large
enough amount of uncertainty and false positives into any reasonably resourceful traffic analysis
method, in order to prevent real-time throttling and blocking.

4.7.  High Traffic Volume and Throughput Capacity
Practically all free and generally available anonymization solutions of today operate at speeds too
low for most users to be interested, or at least be attracted to them. Many of these solutions also
outright explicitly and completely forbid the transfer of larger data volumes. First of all, poor
performance and limitations of any kind are negative traits of any protocol or system, by
themselves. Second of all, and even more importantly, the strength of the provided anonymity
(and also the robustness against DoS attacks of different kinds) in a fully distributed and
decentralized solution like the Phantom protocol, depends on its number of users.
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is to make it as capable, high-performing and non-
limited as possible in the aspects of transfer volume and throughput, while still maintaining
theoretically strong anonymization.
4.8.  Generic, Well-Abstracted and Backward Compatible Design
Last but not least, there are some design goals that practically always constitute winning
strategies when designing complex systems and powerful solutions. First of all, in the long run, a
generic system is practically always superior to a specific system, and especially if it is popular
and used by many people, thus becoming the subject of the accompanying constant flow of ideas
and suggestions for new and creative ways of using and adapting it. Second of all, a well-
abstracted design makes sure that a design mistake in one area doesn’t affect unnecessarily
large parts of the solution as a whole, and also allows for much more efficient collaborative work
by different groups of people with different areas of expertise. Third of all, a design that is
backward compatible with previous solutions and applications will get a much quicker start, has
much greater opportunities to quickly show off its potential, and is much easier to put into a
perspective that people understand and appreciate.
Thus, an important design goal of the protocol is to make it as generic, well-abstracted and
backward compatible with existing adjacent and relevant technologies as possible. This might
sound a bit vague, highfalutin and unnecessary to mention, but as you will see, it will be of great
importance in many ways for this protocol.

5.  Bird’s-Eye View of the Protocol
Now, with all the major goals, directives and assumptions behind the protocol design having been
presented, we can begin to delve into its actual design. At its core, and viewed at the highest
level, the design of the protocol is very simple.
5.1.  Some Initial Definitions
• 
A protocol user is any actor or device that is using the protocol. It could be a home user,
a large server, or possibly even a dedicated anonymization appliance. Everything that
has access to the Internet is a valid candidate.
• 
In the context of this protocol, the real identity of a protocol user is equated with its IP
address on the network in question (which for all matters of this paper will be assumed to
be the Internet). This will hold true even if this IP address isn’t necessarily a dedicated
one for the user, i.e. even if the user is one of many behind a particular NAT firewall, the
identity of the user is considered to be revealed to a certain party if the external IP
address of this NAT firewall is revealed to the same party.
• 
All protocol users participate in the anonymous network, or rather, the protocol users are
even the sole constituents of the anonymous network, since it is fully distributed and
decentralized.
• 
All protocol users in the anonymous network will be represented as network nodes in this
paper. In explanatory figures, these nodes will in turn be represented as circles (of
different color, depending on their role in the current explanation).
• 
An anonymized node is a network node that is making use of the anonymous network to
