User: You need to design a highly available MySQL database architecture to ensure the safety and reliability of business data. Please provide a plan, including key links such as multi-copy synchronization, failover mechanism, backup and recovery.
Assistant: 1. Multi-copy synchronization scheme: - Master-slave replication scheme: build a master-multiple-slave architecture, the master library undertakes writing tasks, and the slave library undertakes reading tasks - Master-slave replication scheme: build a master-slave architecture, the master database Responsible for writing tasks, the standby database is only used as a backup of data, and does not accept read requests. When there is a problem with the main database, it will automatically switch to the standby database. 2. Failover mechanism scheme: - Master-slave replication scheme: when the main database fails, manually Switch the read and write requests to the slave library, at this time the slave library becomes the new main library-master-standby replication scheme: when the main library fails, it will automatically switch to the standby library and perform data synchronization at the same time, and the original main library will be used as the standby library after recovery 3. Backup and recovery plan: - Regular database backup: Regularly back up the database to ensure the safety of business data - Incremental backup: Regularly perform incremental backups to shorten recovery time - Database disaster recovery: Store backup data in different cloud services Provider backup to avoid data loss caused by failure of a single cloud service provider - Automatic recovery: When the database fails, automatic recovery through backup data The above is a reference solution, and the specific implementation can be adjusted and expanded according to business scenarios and needs. When designing the architecture, you also need to consider database performance, security, disaster recovery, monitoring, and scalability.
