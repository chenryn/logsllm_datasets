User: This may be a duplicate, but I couldn't find the question anywhere, so I'll go ahead and ask:
Is there a simple way to delete a superuser from the terminal, perhaps analogous to Django's createsuperuser command?
Assistant: No need to delete superuser...just create another superuser... You can create another superuser with same name as the previous one.
I have forgotten the password of the superuser so I create another superuser with the same name as previously.
