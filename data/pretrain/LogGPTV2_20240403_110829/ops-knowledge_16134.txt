User: Its weird because, when I run a normal python script on the server, it runs but when I run it via uWSGI, it cant import certain modules.
there is a bash script that starts uwsgi, and passes a path via --pythonpath option.
Is this an additional path or all the paths have to be given here ?
If yes, how do I separate multiple paths given by this option.
Assistant: you can specify multiple --pythonpath options, but PYTHONPATH should be honoured (just be sure it is correctly set by your init script, you can try setting it from the command line and running uwsgi in the same shell session)
