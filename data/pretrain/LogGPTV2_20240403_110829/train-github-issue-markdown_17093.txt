 _This works_  
`deno run --allow-write writeToFile.ts`
_But this does not, it just ignores the flag_  
`deno run writeToFile.ts --allow-write`
It should at least throw a warning or something, not just silently ignore
flags passed like in the second example. Please adjust the parser in such a
way, that the second example will also work.
