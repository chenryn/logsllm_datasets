User: Please describe the three-way handshake process of the TCP protocol and explain the purpose of each handshake.
Assistant: The three-way handshake process of the TCP protocol includes the following three steps: 1. The client sends a SYN message to the server. In the first handshake, the client sends a SYN message to the server. SYN means "synchronous", and this message is used to indicate that the client wants to establish a connection. The client will choose a random initial sequence number as the identifier of this connection, and include it in the SYN message and send it to the server. 2. The server sends a SYN/ACK message to the client. In the second handshake, after the server receives the SYN message from the client, it needs to respond to it. The server sends a SYN/ACK message to the client, where SYN indicates that the server agrees to establish a connection, and ACK indicates that the client's SYN message has been received. The server will choose its own initial sequence number in this message, so as to identify it in the subsequent data transmission process. 3. The client sends an ACK message to the server. In the third handshake, the client needs to respond to the SYN/ACK message from the server. The client sends an ACK message to the server, where ACK means to confirm that the server's SYN/ACK message has been received. In this message, the client will add 1 to the initial serial number of the server as the serial number of the next transmission data, and at the same time, the client will also add its own initial serial number + 1 as the serial number of the next data transmission in this step . Through the above three steps, the client and server establish a TCP connection. The purpose of each handshake step is as follows: First handshake: The client informs the server that the client wants to establish a TCP connection and gives an available initial sequence number. The second handshake: The server indicates that it agrees to establish a connection and gives its own initial sequence number. The third handshake: the client confirms the agreement of the server and indicates its own initial serial number, and the connection is established at this time.
