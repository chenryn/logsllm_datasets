Introduction 
In recent years Cybercrime has been front-page news as a result of an increase in profit-
motivated internet crimes; and an apparent lack of sufficient security measures that leave 
standard internet users virtually unprotected from internet crimes.  
Software security vendors have been trying to show progress in the fight against cybercrime 
- with some success. The vast majority of Internet users, however, are still unprotected from 
internet crime that includes fraud, phishing and identity theft. The success of financial 
cybercrime has served to fuel further increase in its levels as more and more criminals turn 
to the Internet as a means for theft.  
It is likely this problem would have been shadowed by other IT security issues, were it not for 
the fact that major corporations are also being targeted - with measurable success - and that 
attacks are growing more and more sophisticated by the day (check out www.datalossdb.org 
for statistics and samples). 
Cyber warfare (i.e. government warfare conducted over the internet), on the other hand, 
hasn't drawn considerable media attention1, mostly because of lack of evidence connecting 
cyber attacks with government policy or actions. In some circles cyber warfare is not even 
considered a serious topic of discussion, being closely associated with conspiracy theories.  
At the same time governments across the world are investing vast resources in developing 
cyber warfare weaponry and awareness, as part of their overall defense and offense 
strategy. 
Leading industrial nations, such as the US, Russia and the UK, as well as developing cyber-
nations including China and Iran, are trying to make sure they won!t stay behind in the cyber

arms race; while at the same time trying to keep "off the radar" in terms of public and media 
awareness to their actions.  
This paper will explore possible links between the political activities of national governments, 
and cybercrime activities, through events that included substantial cyber-warfare 
characteristics. We will also outline a mechanism by which cybercrime is often connected 
with cyber warfare - to the benefit of both governments and cyber criminals.   
Background 
While researching last year some "behind-the-scenes" aspects of cybercrime (including 
technical threats by criminals and business aspects of cybercrime), we uncovered some 
interesting material from a criminally operated server. This material led us to the conclusion 
that there are possible links between a certain criminal organization and government/state 
dealings.  
We then observed several famous cases linking cybercrime with political international 
conflicts, using our experience in order to shed light on mechanisms of cybercrime, and to 
identify links between cybercrime and state-sponsored cyber-attacks.   
Cybercrime 
Cybercrime turned into a major concern as computers and the internet became an integral 
part of daily life. Most research efforts that focus on covering the cybercrime world portray a 
highly organized environment, sometimes at a level akin to organized-crime.  
Targeted and specialized, cybercrime is like a modern economic sector with sub-sectors that 
specialize in different technologies and markets, actively trading between themselves. 
This is a force that adheres to classic economic theories of supply and demand, to rules of 
international business, marketing, distribution channels, outsourcing and financially-driven 
innovation. 
Cybercrime today is almost completely financially driven, and usually bears no relation to 
geographies or politics, unless they play a role in revenue generation. 
One of the major enablers of this economy is the almost nonexistent legislation against 
cybercrime. Where legislation does exist, it is rarely enforced effectively. Although modern 
states do have criminal legislation banning electronic crime, lack of cooperation and 
coordination between countries renders such legislation ineffective, since cybercrime 
recognizes no borders and geographical barriers.  
The existence of regions in which authorities either turn a blind eye or have lax legislation, 
provides a safe haven for cyber criminals and enables cybercrime organizations to get away 
with their activities. 
In terms of technology, most of the vulnerabilities and exploits used in cybercrime are well 
documented, both technologically and financially. Cybercrime tools and skills are often 
offered for a premium in an active marketplace that exists for creating, selling and 
exchanging such technologies; a marketplace that thrives in the fringes of legitimate 
technological markets. 
Most of the victims of cybercrime (whether individuals or businesses) are usually covered by 
local liability and insurance protection, with financial institutions footing the bill for most of the

damages accrued from these activities (it is therefore natural that financial institutions are 
major consumers of security intelligence services and proactive security actions). 
Cyber Warfare 
It is well known that advanced nations are allocating considerable resources to cyber 
warfare and to creating awareness/readiness for cybercrime, as part of a defense and 
offence strategy on the cyber front. 
On the defense side, the aim of cyber warfare is to protect infrastructure, military capabilities 
and civilian institutions.  
On the offence side, the aim of cyber warfare is to target an adversary's critical 
infrastructure, alter their view of the battlefield (both kinetic and virtual), and affect their 
population (propaganda). 
Cyber warfare capabilities range from the more traditional SIGINT (Signal Intelligence), 
including espionage (both internally and externally), development of offensive capabilities to 
render information systems inaccessible or inoperable (including falsifying information), and 
developing defensive capabilities to protect critical IT-reliant infrastructure from attacks. 
Most cyber capabilities developed by advanced countries over the last decade focus on 
military aspects of cyber warfare: stealth vehicles, jamming devices, anti-jamming, secure 
communication capabilities, etc.  
Less attention was given to “classic” computer attacks involving personal computers and 
servers. As a result, governments often found themselves following civilian market 
developments in this field, rather than leading the innovation. 
Past Events and Making the Links 
In order to underscore the recent developments in cybercrime and cyber warfare, we will 
review a number of major cyber warfare events:  
Estonia 
Much has been written on cyber events revolving around the Estonian-Russian cyber war. 
This was an online-only conflict spurred by the relocation of a soviet-era bronze statue in 
Tallinn in 20072. While some call it the first cyber warfare, others denounce the notion, 
claiming there was no direct involvement in cyber activities on the part of the two 
governments supposedly at war. 
Both are right. Estonia was indeed the first public case of effective cyber warfare, which 
brought the country!s IT infrastructure to a standstill.  
For a country like Estonia, which is heavily reliant on its IT infrastructure (most of its banking 
activities, for example, are done online and so is voting and numerous other government 
functions) - the result was the same as warfare targeted a civilian population: for three 
weeks the country!s major infrastructure, including the banking sector, media and 
governments, ceased to work as a result of a DDoS attack (distributed denial of service).

On the other hand, who waged this war? The obvious answer would be Russia. There was 
no proof, however, of direct links between any Russian government or military entities and 
the cyber attacks on Estonia.  
Yet this is exactly how cyber warfare is waged: a Russian official, in answer to claims that 
Russia was behind the attacks, stated that “If you are implying [the attacks] came from 
Russia or the Russian government, it's a serious allegation that has to be substantiated. 
Cyber-space is everywhere”  (Vladimir Chizhov, Russian Ambassador to the EU). 
Tracing back the attacks, we can see each and every one came from civilian networks. More 
notably, the attacks had a form characteristic to attacks used by cyber criminals to extort 
online businesses (that rely on providing uninterrupted service for their revenue generation).  
For background on the techniques and operations, check out a riveting recount of battling 
such threats (with success) here: http://www.csoonline.com/article/print/220336 and here: 
http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/botnet_pr.html (which shows what happens 
when you try to openly and directly fight spammers). 
In the Estonian case, the attacks were not just simple hack-and-deface attacks (attributed to 
the Nashi - a Russian youth political movement), but also an all-out DDoS (Distributed Denial 
of Service) that brought the country!s infrastructure to its knees for over three weeks.  
This DDoS attack came from a botnet that was later associated more closely with a Russian 
cybercrime group operating out of St. Petersburg, with links to the RBN (Russian Business 
Network). RBN has been extensively covered in cybercrime research and was linked to 
Russian politics on more than one occasion3. 
This leads to the question, how and why would a criminal organization whose main objective 
is financial get involved in a purely political issue? How could that involvement come in such 
an organized and timed manner, in response to the events in Tallinn (events that were 
clearly generating political reactions from the Russian Government)?  
The only conclusion is obvious: one of the lines of business of Russian groups linked to the 
attacks is what is called "botnet4 rental".
