### Implementation of Wireless Surveillance and Public Safety Networks in Various U.S. Cities

#### New Orleans, Louisiana
**Type of Implementation:** Tropos Wi-Fi Mesh Network  
**Application:** Police surveillance and crime reduction

As part of Mayor C. Ray Nagin’s ambitious crime-fighting agenda, the city of New Orleans evaluated both wired and wireless solutions for a new surveillance system. The city ultimately chose a wireless system operating on unlicensed spectrum, which was deemed more versatile, reliable, and cost-effective compared to other alternatives.

The city selected a Wi-Fi mesh network by Tropos, with nodes mounted on power poles, drawing power from them as part of an agreement with the city's power utility. During Hurricane Katrina, this system captured some of the most dramatic footage of the disaster until the power grid failed.

Using detailed crime maps, the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) worked with the mayor’s Office of Technology to strategically place cameras in areas with high incidences of murders, robberies, vehicle thefts, and drug trafficking. The IP-based cameras, controlled remotely from police headquarters, provide high-quality digital images accessible to any wireless device on the city’s IP network. The reconfigurable mesh architecture allows for easy relocation of Wi-Fi nodes and cameras, enhancing safety during special events like the annual Mardi Gras parade. During the pilot phase from January to August 2004, the area covered by the surveillance network saw a 57% reduction in murders and a 30% decrease in car thefts compared to the same period the previous year.

#### Pratt, Kansas
**Type of Implementation:** 2.4 GHz Alvarion BreezeACCESS System  
**Application:** Mobile broadband access for law enforcement

Pratt, Kansas, has implemented a mobile broadband wireless network that enables police officers to access critical law enforcement applications from their patrol cars. Officers can obtain arrest and criminal information, access department databases, and submit reports from the field without returning to the office. The private city network, built on Alvarion Inc.’s BreezeACCESS system, utilizes the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band. This choice avoids user fees and higher equipment costs associated with licensed frequencies. Network nodes are installed on water, airport, and other civic towers, providing T-1 comparable (1.544 Mbps) connectivity. For added security, the network employs Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) technology and a firewall to ensure data privacy.

#### Las Vegas, Nevada
**Type of Implementation:** 2.4 GHz Tropos MetroMesh  
**Application:** City police and fire network, downtown hotspot

Initially seeking a better way to control traffic lights, Las Vegas decided to build a Wi-Fi mesh network to support traffic monitoring and communication for public safety personnel. The self-healing nature of the mesh network makes it robust enough to handle potential Homeland Security crises. The first 5 square kilometers cost $175,000, with the total coverage of the city estimated at $6 million. Cheetah Wireless, using similar equipment, offers public access "hot zones" to subscribers across the city, helping to keep costs low and bringing high-speed wireless access to the general population.

#### Spokane, Washington
**Type of Implementation:** 802.11 Wireless  
**Application:** Downtown hotzone and public safety

Spokane’s network, covering 100 city blocks, is primarily used for public safety applications and is claimed to be the largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the U.S. The network has two domains: (1) the city's private domain for public safety, mobile workforce, and automated parking enforcement, and (2) the public domain, SpokaneHotzone, provided by OneEighty Networks, a local ISP. The network supports various public safety uses, such as allowing firefighters to download floor plans before entering a burning building.

#### Odessa, Washington
**Application:** Wi-Fi Internet, public safety (police vehicle data access)

Odessa Office Equipment, a WISP serving several towns, set up a wireless data access network for local police departments. Law enforcement officers will soon be able to run bandwidth-intensive applications, such as fingerprint identification, from the field, aiding in the immediate identification of individuals with outstanding warrants or suspended licenses. The availability of unlicensed low-frequency spectrum is essential for this capability.

#### Tacoma, Washington
**Application:** Homeland security, monitoring inventory at Port of Tacoma using RFID

Odessa Office Equipment also installed a system using unlicensed wireless to read Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) tags on shipping containers at the Port of Tacoma. Using RF ID readers on moving cranes, the system automatically identifies what is coming off each ship before the containers leave the port.

#### Charlotte County, Florida
**Type of Implementation:** 5 GHz unlicensed Motorola Canopy  
**Application:** Wi-Fi Internet for businesses and emergency services

DayStar Communications provides high-speed wired and wireless data and voice services for business communities in Port Charlotte, Punta Gorda, and Venice. After Hurricane Charley in 2004, DayStar offered free domestic Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone calls and Wi-Fi Internet access to county residents at two locations. This service was particularly helpful for the elderly, who needed to contact relatives and register for FEMA assistance. The high-bandwidth unlicensed wireless network proved critical during the crisis when wired communications were down.

#### Daytona Beach Shores, Florida
**Type of Implementation:** 5.3 GHz Unlicensed Wireless  
**Application:** Residential/business Internet, municipal and public safety

Qmega Technologies, Inc. has provided high-speed wireless Internet access to businesses and residents of Daytona Beach Shores for four years. The company also provides wireless Internet services for city hall and public safety, connecting five city buildings wirelessly for voice and data. During the 2004 hurricanes, the city’s wireless network remained online, enabling officials to access weather and hurricane reports for better evacuation and response planning.

#### Rio Rico, Arizona
**Type of Implementation:** 802.11 Wireless  
**Application:** Public safety/first responder; eventually, access for schools and residents

Santa Cruz County is constructing a public safety network over a 32-mile stretch of US I-19, funded by a two-year, $500,000 Homeland Security grant. After the initial period, the county will sell part of the network’s bandwidth to customers near the highway to make the network self-sustaining. Early tests have shown the ability to hold VoIP calls at 80 mph.

#### Buffalo, Minnesota
**Type of Implementation:** Motorola MeshNetworks; 2.4 GHz Band QDMA  
**Applications:** Public safety, city utilities

Buffalo, located 40 miles north of Minneapolis, has a public safety network using Motorola’s proprietary mesh architecture on the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band. The network, covering 12.4 square miles, went live in February 2005 and is used for police, fire, and other city services. The city also operates a parallel Wi-Fi ISP, Buffalo Wireless Internet Group, offering affordable internet packages.

#### South Sioux City, Nebraska
**Type of Implementation:** 802.11b Wi-Fi  
**Applications:** Public safety, city utilities

South Sioux City first built a fiber optic ring in the late 1990s and later experimented with wireless in 2002. Initial trials were so promising that they decided to build a dedicated network for public safety and municipal uses, receiving a $457,000 grant from Homeland Security. The network will cover the city’s schools, supporting a system of security cameras while providing students with wireless Internet access.

#### Ripon, California
**Type of Implementation:** Motorola MeshNetworks; 2.4 GHz Band QDMA  
**Applications:** Public safety, city utilities; eventually open for public access

Ripon, a town of 13,000 people, is deploying a mesh network using Motorola’s hardware, covering 8 square miles. The network will be used for public safety and municipal applications, such as real-time remote monitoring of city wells and pump station data. The city expects to save at least $2,000 per month, with the total cost estimated at $500,000, offset by a $75,000 homeland security grant. The network will eventually be made publicly accessible, aiming to attract residents from Silicon Valley.
