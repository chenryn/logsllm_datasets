points around the city as part of Mayor C. Ray 
Nagin’s ambitious crime-fighting agenda. The 
city researched both wired and wireless 
solutions, and ultimately decided that a 
wireless system operating on unlicensed 
spectrum would be both versatile, reliable and 
more cost-effective than other alternatives.

The city selected to anchor its police surveillance system on a Wi-Fi mesh network by Tropos. 
Wi-Fi nodes are mounted on the city’s power poles, drawing power from them as part of an 
agreement with the city power utility. Indeed, during Hurricane Katrina, some of the most 
dramatic videos of the disaster were recorded by the city’s wireless surveillance system—at least 
until the power grid went down. 
Using detailed crime maps of the city, the New Orleans Police Department worked with the 
mayor’s Office of Technology to place cameras in the areas most plagued by murders, robberies, 
vehicle thefts and drug trafficking. The IP-based cameras, controlled remotely from police 
headquarters, provide high-quality digital images that can be made available to any wireless 
device on the city’s IP network.  The reconfigurable mesh architecture of the city’s Wi-Fi 
network allows city officials to easily move Wi-Fi nodes and cameras to needed areas. This is 
helpful to ensure safety at special events, such as the annual Mardi Gras parade. During the pilot 
phase of the project, conducted from January through August of 2004, the area covered by the 
surveillance network recorded 57% fewer murders and 30% fewer car thefts than in the same 
months the previous year.  
Pratt, Kansas 
Type of Implementation: 2.4 GHz Alvarion BreezeACCESS system 
Application: Mobile broadband access for law enforcement 
The rural Kansas town of Pratt has a mobile broadband wireless network that allows police 
officers to access critical law enforcement related applications from their patrol cars. Officers can 
obtain critical arrest and other criminal information, access department databases and submit 
reports from the field, without having to report to the office. The private city network, which 
allows both fixed and mobile data access, is built on Alvarion Inc.’s BreezeACCESS system, 
which utilizes the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band.  The city chose an unlicensed wireless solution to 
avoid the user fees and higher equipment costs associated with a licensed frequency. Network 
nodes are installed on water, airport and other civic towers. The network covers the entire city, 
and provides T-1 comparable (1.544 Mbps) connectivity. For added security, the network 
employs Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) technology and a firewall to ensure data 
privacy.  
Las Vegas, Nevada 
Type of Implementation: 2.4 GHz Tropos MetroMesh  
Application: City police and fire network and downtown hotspot 
Began as a search for a better way to control traffic lights, the city of Las Vegas realized that Wi-
Fi could do that and more. The city decided to build a mesh network to support traffic monitoring 
and communication for public safety personnel. Mesh networks such as that of Las Vegas are 
self-healing in the event of a node failure, making them robust enough to survive a potential 
Homeland Security crisis. The first 5 square kilometers cost $175,000, and coverage of the entire 
city is estimated to cost just $6 million. Using the access granted them by the city, Cheetah 
Wireless is also able to use the similar equipment to offer public access “hot zones” to subscribers 
all over the city. This business model helps keeps cost to the city low, and brings the 
benefits of high-speed wireless access to the general population. 
Spokane, Washington 
Type of Implementation: 802.11 Wireless 
Application: Downtown hotzone and public safety 
6
Spokane’s network covers 100 city blocks and is used primarily for public safety applications. 
The city claims it is largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the US. The network has two domains: 
(1) the city's private domain which it uses for public safety, mobile workforce, and automated 
parking enforcement and (2) the public domain, SpokaneHotzone, which is devoted to public 
access offered through OneEighty Networks, a local ISP. Time Magazine profiled Spokane’s 
network, citing many examples of current and planned public safety uses, such as allowing fire 
fighters to download floor plans before entering a burning building. 
Odessa, Washington 
Application: Wi-Fi Internet, public safety (police vehicle data access) 
Odessa Office Equipment is a WISP serving the towns of Odessa, Wilbur, Creston and Ephrata 
with its 11Mbps wireless system running on unlicensed spectrum. Odessa set up a wireless data 
access network for the local police departments. According to Marlon Schafer, the company’s 
owner, police in the region report that roughly 50% of their stops are of people who lie about 
their identity and don’t present proper identification. Law enforcement officers will soon be able 
to run bandwidth-intensive applications such as fingerprint identification from in the field in 
cases like this, to help immediately identify individuals with outstanding arrest warrants, 
suspended licenses, etc.  The availability of unlicensed low-frequency spectrum to carry such data 
at high speeds is essential to making that a reality.  
Tacoma, Washington 
Application: Homeland security, monitoring inventory at Port of Tacoma using RFID 
Unlicensed wireless has important homeland security applications as well. Odessa Office 
Equipment (profiled above) also installed a system that uses unlicensed wireless to read 
Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) tags on shipping containers at the Port of Tacoma. Using 
RF ID readers on moving cranes, the system automatically identified what was coming off each 
ship before the containers even left the port.  
Charlotte County, Florida 
Type of Implementation: 5 GHz unlicensed Motorola Canopy  
Application: Wi-Fi Internet for businesses and emergency services 
DayStar Communications provides high-speed wired and wireless data and voice services for the 
business communities of Port Charlotte, Punta Gorda and Venice. DayStar has a Wi-Fi network 
operating on unlicensed spectrum covering parts of Punta Gorda, Port Charlotte, Englewood and 
Venice. The company offers an affordable wireless Internet package for businesses in the region. 
After Hurricane Charley devastated the Gulf Coast in the summer of 2004, DayStar opened its 
arms to the community and began offering free domestic Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) 
phone calls and Wi-Fi Internet access to county residents at two different locations. Sixteen VOIP 
telephones were made available in Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte. A DayStar Communications 
representative was made available at each location to help residents use the service. DayStar 
President Al Sanders was especially concerned about the region’s elderly, who were forced to 
wait in long lines to call relatives and register for assistance from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency following the disaster. Sanders decided to offer the service to assist in 
hurricane-related situations. The availability of a high-bandwidth unlicensed wireless network 
proved critical in getting assistance to the elderly community during a time of crisis, when wired 
communications had gone down.

Daytona Beach Shores, Florida 
Type of Implementation: 5.3 GHz Unlicensed Wireless 
Application: Residential/business Internet, municipal and public safety 
For the past four years, local WISP Qmega Technologies, Inc. has provided high-speed wireless 
Internet access to the businesses and residents of the entire town of Daytona Beach Shores, FL.  
Qmega has an agreement with the city to provide wireless Internet services for the city hall & 
public safety as well. The five buildings of the city complex are connected wirelessly to each 
other, with voice and data, which in turn allows police officers & staff in City Hall to be able to 
access public safety applications over an encrypted link. All of this is done with Mikrotik routers 
using unlicensed spectrum in the 5.3 Ghz band. The entire city core is covered for mobile in-car 
service. The city’s high-speed network has also proved its importance not just in police work, but 
in emergency response as well. During the devastating 2004 Florida hurricanes, the city’s 
wireless network was online during the storms, enabling city officials to look up weather & 
hurricane reports online to better plan evacuation and response efforts. Unfortunately, because 
Qmega’s coverage area will not include a new public safety complex being built 20 miles away, 
the city is now forced to switch to a more expensive cellular service.  
Rio Rico, Arizona 
Type of Implementation: 802.11 Wireless 
Application: Public safety/first responder; eventually, access for schools and residents 
Santa Cruz County is constructing a public safety network over a 32-mile stretch of US I-19, part 
of the CANAMEX corridor that links Canada to Mexico. The project is being financed by a two-
year, $500,000 Homeland Security grant, secured through the Arizona Telecommunications and 
Information Council. After that time frame, the county will begin selling part of the network’s 
bandwidth to customers living near the highway to provide Internet access, revenues which will 
make the network self-supporting. Two thirds of Santa Cruz County’s schools are within a half-
mile of the highway, putting them within range of the network. Early tests have demonstrated the 
ability to hold VoIP calls at 80 mph. 
Buffalo, Minnesota 
Type of Implementation: Motorola MeshNetworks; 2.4 GHz Band QDMA 
Applications: Public safety, city utilities 
Buffalo, a town located 40 miles north of Minneapolis, has a public safety network that does not 
use standard Wi-Fi protocols. Rather, it utilizes Motorola’s proprietary mesh architecture on the 
2.4 GHz unlicensed band, giving each node a one-mile range. The city’s network, covering 12.4 
square miles, went live in February 2005, and is used for Police, Fire, and other city services, for 
the usual suite of applications: filing reports and checking records from the road, accessing 
architectural information from the field (useful for both firefighters and civil engineers), etc. The 
city also maintains a parallel Wi-Fi ISP, Buffalo Wireless Internet Group, using standard Wi-Fi, 
which charges just $9.99 per month for 192kbps; and $23.99 for 384kbps. The builder of the 
Network, WaveRider, claims 20% household penetration and 60% business penetration.

South Sioux City, Nebraska 
Type of Implementation: 802.11b Wi-Fi 
Applications: Public safety, city utilities 
South Sioux City first built its own Fiber Optic ring in the late 90s to provide high-speed 
communications for the city government, and leased bandwidth to private ISPs to resell to 
residents and businesses. They then experimented with wireless in 2002, and initial trials were so 
promising that they decided to build a dedicated network for public safety and municipal uses, for 
which they received a $457,000 grant from Homeland Security. The city is not initially planning 
for total coverage, but for a dense enough scattering of hotspots so that officers in the field will 
never be more than a few minutes away from one. The network will also cover the city’s schools, 
supporting a system of security cameras while simultaneously giving students wireless Internet 
access. 
Ripon, California 
Type of Implementation: Motorola MeshNetworks; 2.4 GHz Band QDMA 
Applications: Public safety, city utilities; eventually open for public access 
Ripon, a town of 13,000 people in California’s Central Valley, is deploying a mesh network using 
Motorola’s hardware and covering 8 square miles. The city researched both licensed and 
unlicensed wireless solutions, and overwhelmingly decided upon an unlicensed solution due to its 
high quality cost advantages. The will be used for public safety and other municipal uses such as 
real-time remote monitoring of city wells and pump station data and Geographical Information 
Systems mapping of the city. City police officers will have mobile data systems in their cars, and 
soon the city will use the network to deploy more than 20 surveillance cameras to monitor and 
investigate suspected criminal activity. The cameras will be placed at three truck stops on a major 
freeway, in city parks and at locations in the downtown area, among other places. The network is 
expected initially to save the police department at least $2,000 per month. Overall, the network is 
expected to cost $500,000 (with no recurring fees), offset by a $75,000 homeland security grant. 
The 18-month preliminary study rejected cellular as being too expensive and limited in its data 
capacity, deciding instead on unlicensed IP based service. The network will be made publicly 
accessible eventually, which the city hopes to use to attract residents from Silicon Valley.
