**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :
Would like to be able to treat an object field as String given the following
mapping:
              "properties": {
                "severity": {
                  "index": "not_analyzed",
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "metadata": {
                  "type": "string"
                  "coerce": true
                }
              }
Indexing the following document:
    {
        "severity": "ERROR",
        "metadata": {
            "someKey": "someValue",
            "someKey": {
                "some nested key": "some nested value"
            } 
        }
    }
should store the document under `metadata` as a searchable String.
Right now, it is not possible to coerce anything to a String.
