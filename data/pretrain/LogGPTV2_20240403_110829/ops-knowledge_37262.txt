User: The hard disk of an existing server has used more than 80% of the space and needs to be cleaned up. Please provide a feasible disk cleanup solution to ensure that no important data and files are lost.
Assistant: The following are feasible disk cleaning solutions: 1. First, organize and archive files, delete useless or duplicate files and temporary files, and free up space. 2. Use the disk cleaning tool to clean up garbage, delete system temporary files, browser cache, log files, and free up more space. 3. Move larger files to other storage media, such as external hard disk or cloud storage, so as to reduce the occupation of local hard disk. 4. For older backup files and unused applications, you can consider deleting or transferring them to save space. 5. Carry out disk defragmentation, reorganize disk fragments into continuous space, thereby improving the efficiency of hard disk read and write, and can also release part of the space. It should be noted that important files and data must be backed up before disk cleanup to prevent data loss due to misuse. At the same time, you also need to delete files carefully to avoid deleting wrong files.
