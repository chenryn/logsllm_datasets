User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Using group policy preferences to push a file to C:\Windows on a restricted user We have a really old Video learning program that we need to run from the network for our students. However it uses Director Player 6.0 and the students get the error: "Unable to copy the driver file C:\Windows\xobglu16.dll to your Windows directory. Your disk may be full"

Now the solution I've read is to copy the files manually to each machine and mark them read-only.

I'm trying to do this via GPP, but the Event log is showing an Access is denied error. I believe it is because the student accounts do not have permission to c:\windows.

Any ideas on a work around without using a script?

Assistant: Make sure you haven't checked the "Run in user security context" box on the files you're pushing out. That would be on the "common" tab in GPP. If that is unchecked and you're still getting the error, it would be a very good idea to try and get this pushed out through the Computer GPP. Since these are probably student machines, they're likely in an OU that's full of them anyway.
