Question: A user has activated Advanced Data Protection for their iCloud account but wants to maintain web access to their data via iCloud.com. Evaluate the consequences and mechanisms of the user's decision to enable web access after activating Advanced Data Protection.
"A": "Enabling web access after turning on Advanced Data Protection requires the user to authorise web sign-in on a trusted device, which temporarily uploads required service keys to iCloud web servers.",
"B": "Once web access is enabled, encrypted iCloud data remains inaccessible through the web, ensuring no decryption keys are exposed to iCloud web servers.",
"C": "Authorising web access after enabling Advanced Data Protection will allow iCloud web servers to decrypt and display the user's data without further device authorisation for each session.",
"D": "When web access is enabled, the user's device will only upload service keys for an allow list of services, and user notifications will be triggered upon each service key upload."
