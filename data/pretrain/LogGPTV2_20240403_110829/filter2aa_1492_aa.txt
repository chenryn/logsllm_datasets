Regulation\Compliance 
•
For an industry that makes a decent amount of revenue there 
is little to no regulation\compliance 
•
Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission and Kahnawake 
Gaming Commission 
•
Party Poker and other sites do not allow players from the USA 
and in certain countries (i.e. UK) it is regulated and taxed. 
“Licensed and regulated by the Government of Gibraltar, our games are powered 
by the bwin.party systems which are independently tested to ensure that our 
games operate correctly, are fair, their outcomes are not predictable and that 
the system is reliable, resilient and otherwise up to the highest standards of 
software integrity, including access control, change control recording, 
fingerprinting of the executables and regular monitoring of all critical 
components of our systems.”

Regulation\Compliance (Cont.) 
There is a need for 
compliance related 
activities if online poker is 
to become regulated and 
safe to play in the USA.   
A standard needs to be 
developed and companies 
that provide these services 
need to be audited.  Not 
just from the financial 
perspective, but the 
technical perspective.   
Why will this happen?

Random Number Generator 
Vulnerability 
•
Documented in 1999 and originally published in 
Developer.com 
•
PlanetPoker had published their shuffling algorithm to 
demonstrate the game’s integrity 
•
ASF Software developed the shuffling algorithm

Random Number Generator 
Vulnerability (Cont.) 
•
In a real deck of cards, there are 52! (approximately 2^226) 
possible unique shuffles. 
•
In their algorithm only 4 billion possible shuffles can result from this 
algorithm 
•
Seed for the random number generator using the Pascal function 
Randomize() 
•
Number reduces to 86,400,000 
•
They were able to reduce the number of possible combinations 
down to a number on the order of 200,000 possibilities 
•
Based on the five known cards their program searched through the 
few hundred thousand possible shuffles to determine the correct 
one

Random Number Generator 
Vulnerability (Cont.) 
•
These days companies have their RNG audited by reputable 3rd 
parties  
•
From Poker Stars site: “Cigital, the largest consulting firm specializing in 
software security and quality, has confirmed the reliability and security of the 
random number generator (RNG) that PokerStars uses to shuffle cards on its 
online poker site, showing the solution meets or exceeds best practices in 
generating unpredictable and statistically random values for dealing cards.”

UB/Absolute Super User Issue 
•
Full story is almost like a soap opera. 
•
Cheating is thought to have occurred between 2004-2008 
when members of online poker forum began investigating. 
•
Still actively being investigated by people such as Haley 
(http://haleyspokerblog.blogspot.com/).

UB/Absolute Super User Issue (Cont.) 
• Story is owner suspected cheating and asked software 
developer to put in a tool to “help catch the cheaters” 
• Hired an independent contractor to put in a tool which 
became known as “god mode” 
• God Mode worked like this: the tool couldn’t be used on 
the same computer that someone was using. Someone 
else would need to log into UB and turn the tool on. 
That person could then see all hole cards on the site–
and then feed the information. 
• 23 accounts. 117 usernames. $22 million dollars

just XOR it…….
