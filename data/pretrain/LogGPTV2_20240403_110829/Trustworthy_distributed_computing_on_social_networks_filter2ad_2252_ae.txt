in the computing services). That is, the time it takes to finish
tasks originated by a given fraction of nodes in such graph,
and for the majority of these nodes, ends in a relatively short
time. On the other hand, such characteristics and advantages
are maintained even when the number of outsourcers of
computations is as high as 50 percent of the nodes, contrary
to the case of other graphs with dense structure and high
connectivity known to be proper for the aforementioned
applications. This last observation encourages us to inves-
tigate further scenarios of deployment of our design. We
anticipate interesting findings based on the inherit structure
of such deployment contextsVsince such contexts may
have different social structures that would affect the utility
of the built computing overlay.
Future Work
8.2
This paper opens several future directions and call for further
investigation at several fronts. To this end, in the future we
will look to extend this work in directions: completing the
missing design components in a simulation fashion and
realizing a working real-world deployment and application.
In the first direction, we aim to complete the missing
ingredient of
the simulator and enrich it by further
scenarios of deployment of our design, under failure,
with various scheduling algorithms at both sides of the
outsourcer and workers (in addition to those discussed in
344
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING, VOL. 7, NO. 3,
JULY-SEPTEMBER 2014
this work). We also would like to consider other overhead
characteristics that might not be in line with topological
characteristics in the social graph. These characteristics
may include the uptime, downtime, communication over-
head, and I/O overhead consumption, among others.
In the second direction, we will turn our attention from the
simulation settings to real-world deployment settings, thus
addressing options discussed in Section 6.6. We will also
implement a proof-of-concept application, among those dis-
cussed in Section 3.3, by utilizing design options discussed in
this paper. We anticipate hidden complexities in the design to
arise, and significant findings to come out of the deployment.
