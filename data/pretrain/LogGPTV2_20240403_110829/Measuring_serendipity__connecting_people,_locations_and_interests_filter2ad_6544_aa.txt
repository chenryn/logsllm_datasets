ABSTRACT
Characterizing the relationship that exists between people’s
application interests and mobility properties is the core ques-
tion relevant for location-based services, in particular those
that facilitate serendipitous discovery of people, businesses
and objects. In this paper, we apply rule mining and spec-
tral clustering to study this relationship for a population
of over 280,000 users of a 3G mobile network in a large
metropolitan area. Our analysis reveals that (i) People’s
movement patterns are correlated with the applications they
access, e.g., stationary users and those who move more often
and visit more locations tend to access diﬀerent applications.
(ii) Location aﬀects the applications accessed by users, i.e.,
at certain locations, users are more likely to evince interest
in a particular class of applications than others irrespective
of the time of day. (iii) Finally, the number of serendipitous
meetings between users of similar cyber interest is larger
in regions with higher density of hotspots. Our analysis
demonstrates how cellular network providers and location-
based services can beneﬁt from knowledge of the inter-play
between users and their locations and interests.

INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in technology allow mobile devices to
ﬁnd their physical location via a multitude of methods: cell
tower look up, cell tower triangulation, cell tower and wi-ﬁ
access point triangulation [6] and Global Positioning Sys-
tem (GPS), with varying accuracy levels. Besides the use
of location estimation for navigation services, a new class
of applications, ‘serendipitous’ location-based services, have
also gained tremendous popularity. These services and ap-
plications allow users to serendipitously, i.e., accidentally
discover people, businesses and other locations around them
that match their interests.
For instance,
location-aware social networking applica-
tions such as Loopt [3] or Pelago [4] enable ‘serendipitous
meetings’ between friends who discover that they are in the
same neighborhood or city and hence may decide to meet.
Some applications [5] even facilitate formation of new rela-
tionships by allowing users to share their location and proﬁle
information with the entire user base. A user can look up
who else is in proximity and depending on common interests,
can decide to communicate. Furthermore, location tagging
services allow a user to leave interesting tags about a partic-
ular geographic location, e.g., photos [1] or snippets about
current events, etc., and then other users who are in vicin-
ity of that location could be automatically prompted with
those geo-tags. Finally, location-based advertising [2] allows
a retailer to send advertisements to users on detecting that
a user, who previously opted-in to the service, has entered
the ‘geo-fence’ area around the retailer.
These serendipitous location-based services are typically
designed to work even when users provide only coarse-grained
location information. This is due to several reasons. First
and perhaps the most important reason is privacy related.
Users may be more comfortable sharing their location with
friends and businesses at coarse-levels such as neighborhood
or city as opposed to ﬁner-levels such as street address or
GPS coordinates. Second, a vast majority of mobile phones
in a 3G network are still not GPS enabled and hence their
location needs to be obtained via other techniques such as
cell tower look up.
267Regardless, these applications still provide a meaningful
experience in the face of coarse location information. In so-
cial networking, it is suﬃcient for two friends to decide to
meet up if they know that they are in the same neighbor-
hood - they do not necessarily have to know each other’s
exact latitude and longitude to decide on meeting up. Sim-
ilarly, for location-based tagging as well as advertising, if
someone is within a radius of a few hundred meters to a
few miles, that can be suﬃcient for prompting the user with
geo-tags left by others or advertisements from businesses in
the neighborhood.
The fundamental questions relevant to these serendipi-
tous location-based services remain yet unanswered. For in-
stance, how likely is it to meet in our daily lives, and where,
with people who share similar interests in cyber domain?
What role does our physical location play in terms of what
we access online from there?
We answer these questions by considering an underlying,
yet even broader question: what is the relationship between
one’s mobility properties and aﬃliations towards given ap-
plications in cyber domain? We answer this question by
systematically and methodically studying the user mobil-
ity and Web access patterns for over 280,000 clients of a
3G mobile network in a large metropolitan area. Using a
one-week network trace, we obtain the application interest
expressed by a user by classifying URLs accessed in to broad
categories such as social networking, dating, music, gaming,
trading, etc. We obtain mobility patterns by extracting the
time-sequence of base-stations accessed by users.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to systemat-
ically study the relationship between mobility patterns and
application aﬃliations at such a large scale. This is our main
contribution. Among a number of insights that we provide,
the key one is that we present a ﬁrst-of-its-kind evidence
suggesting a strong application aﬃnity at certain locations
irrespective of time of day, i.e., certain locations inspire peo-
ple to access a speciﬁc application type.
To understand the relationship between mobility and the
corresponding application usage, we apply an association
rule-mining approach [25] to extract the most prominent be-
havior in mobility and applications. Our analysis conﬁrms
previously reported results [20] on the high predictability
of human movement. For example, we ﬁnd that 70% of
users return back to at least one common location every
day over a one week period. In addition, we ﬁnd strong cor-
relation and anti-correlation between some applications and
mobility. For example, we ﬁnd that listening and download-
ing music prevails for stationary users. For mobile users,
bandwidth- and battery-intensive applications (such as mu-
sic) fade away, while e-mail prevails.
We ﬁnd that users spend most of their time within their
‘comfort zone’ consisting of three top-most locations, includ-
ing home and work. The access behavior inside and outside
the ‘comfort zone’ diﬀers. For example, dating applications
are mostly accessed from within the ‘comfort zone’, but nei-
ther from home nor from work. On the other hand, users
who leave the ‘comfort zone’ exhibit the tendency of stay-
ing connected by accessing social networking sites, reading
e-mail and news.
Next, we explore the relationship among locations and
applications accessed at them. To achieve this, we extend
the rule-mining approach to identify location hotspots. We
deﬁne four types of hotspots based on the time of day when
they are active, i.e., day, noon, evening, and night. We ﬁnd
that there is a strong bias towards applications accessed by
people at the locations at which hotspots occur. Because the
hotspots we deﬁne are time dependent, we explore whether
the root cause of the observed application skew is the time
of day or the location itself. We ﬁnd that in majority of
scenarios, it is location that dominantly impacts which ap-
plications are accessed.
Finally, to explore the probability that people with similar
cyber aﬃnities meet each other in the real world, we proceed
as follows. Using a spectral clustering approach [12], we split
the metropolitan area into smaller regions. We ﬁnd that the
frequency with which one meets others who share the same
cyber interests is determined by the density of hotspots in a
given region, i.e., fraction of locations that are hotspots in
the region.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we pro-
vide details about the trace, and explain how we mine the
desired mobility and application usage information. In Sec-
tion 3, we deﬁne our rule-mining based approach and pro-
vide insights about the relationship between mobility, ap-
plications, and locations. In Section 4, we explore hotspots,
perform the regional analysis in Section 5 and in Section 6,
we present related work. We summarize our ﬁndings in Sec-
tion 7 and discuss potential beneﬁts to cellular networks and
location-based services.
2. PRELIMINARIES
Here, we provide details about the dataset. Then, we ex-
plain how we extract users’ mobility properties and interests
in the cyber domain, i.e., aﬃliation towards given Internet
applications and services.
2.1 Trace Description
We use an anonymized trace collected from the content
billing system for the data network of a large 3G mobile ser-
vice provider. The trace contains information about 281,394
clients in a large metropolitan area of 1,900 square miles
(approx. 5,000 square kilometers) during a seven day pe-
riod.
It preserves user privacy as all identiﬁers such as
users’ phone numbers, email addresses and ip-addresses were
anonymized.
The trace provides details of a packet data session de-
ﬁned as beginning from the time the user is authenticated
by the authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)
protocol by the Remote Authentication Dial in User Ser-
vice (RADIUS) [24] server to the time the user logs oﬀ. In
between, a user’s packet data session consists of HTTP and
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) sessions1 initiated by
the user.
When a customer logs on, the serving Packet Data Serv-
ing Node sends a RADIUS Access-Request to the RADIUS
server. If the user is successfully authenticated, the RADIUS
server returns an Access-Accept message which contains a
‘correlation identiﬁer’ which will be used to uniquely iden-
tify the user through the entire packet data session. Next,
the Packet Data Serving Node uses the RADIUS accounting
protocol (RADA) [23] for communicating events that involve
data usage to the RADIUS server [23].
These accounting messages contain the following relevant
information:
local timestamp, anonymized user identiﬁer
(phone number or email address), anonymized ip-address
assigned to the user, correlation identiﬁer, and the base-
station that was currently serving the user besides other in-

formation. These accounting messages can be of type Start,
Update and Stop and there can be any number of these mes-
sages within a packet data session. Start messages are used
to indicate the beginning of a new accounting activity, e.g.,
when the user starts a new application in the current data
session. Update messages are generated periodically to in-
dicate the current accounting status of the data session [7].
The Stop message contains an attribute, ‘Session Continue’
which when set to ‘false’ is indicative of the end of the ses-
sion. Changes in user’s currently associated base-station are
reported either in an Update message or via a Stop message
immediately followed by a Start containing the new base-
station.
Each HTTP session contains the following details: user’s
anonymized ip-address, the URL accessed and the local times-
tamp. Because the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is
run over HTTP in this network, the trace provides the same
records for MMS as well.
We reconstruct a user’s entire packet data session as fol-
lows. Using RADIUS and RADA messages, we build an as-
sociation between a user identiﬁer (phone number of email
address) and his currently assigned ip-address. Then, we
identify the applications accessed by a user by grouping the
HTTP and MMS sessions that occur after a RADIUS ses-
sion and have the same ip-address as was assigned to the
user.
The trace provides the location of a user in terms of the
base-station. In the trace, we have a total of 1,196 base sta-
tions for the large metropolitan area. The area serviced by a
base-station in this network varies from hundreds of square
meters (in densely populated areas) to several square miles
(in sparsely populated areas). On average a base station ser-
vices 4 square kilometers. In the remainder of the paper, we
use the term location to refer to the area serviced by a spe-
ciﬁc base-station. Thus, while our trace does not provide
GPS-level ﬁne-grained location information, we will show
later that location information at the level of base-stations
is still invaluable from the perspective of the serendipitous
location-based services. In particular, we will show how we
can infer generic user mobility properties (Sections 2.2,3.1),
as well as correlate locations with application usage (Sec-
tion 3.2).
2.2 Extracting Mobility Properties
Here, we explain how we extract mobility patterns from
the trace and present preliminary results about human mo-
bility.

Figure 1 shows an example for the location sequence of
a user across two diﬀerent packet data sessions. We use
the RADIUS accounting packets of type Start, Update, and
Stop to extract the sequence of locations or base-stations
accessed by a user along with the timestamps at which the
user was present at those locations.
There can be two kinds of movements for a user. (i) (i)
Intra-session movement happens when the user’s location
changes within a packet data session due to hand-oﬀs, e.g.,
between (Accept, 0, 1) and (Start, 2, 2). (ii) Inter-session
movement happens when the location changes during the
inactive time, i.e., when the user is not active in the mobile
network, e.g., between (Stop, 7, 3) and (Accept, 9,3).
We consider a user to be stationary if the base-station he is
associated with does not change. That is even if the user did
physically move within the base-station, for our purposes,
we consider him as stationary. Similarly, there can be two
kinds of stationary events for a user: (i) intra-session when
a user’s location stays the same within a packet data session
and; (ii) inter-session when a user’s location remains the
same between two consecutive sessions.
In our seven-day long trace, we record 3,162,818 packet
data sessions, generated by 281,394 users. Table 1 provides
a few representative statistics for the trace.
2.2.1
Basic Mobility Observations
While we are able to detect a user’s access to the mo-
bile data network and accurately estimate a given location
(above) and characterize accessed applications (below), an
important underlying question is if we are able to accurately
estimate user mobility patterns. In particular, there is on
average a gap of 6 hours and 11 minutes between two con-
secutive sessions from the same user. On separating users
as those who move and those who stay stationary between
two consecutive packet data sessions, we obtain the average
inter-session move and stationary times as 8 hours and 23
minutes, and 4 hours and 25 minutes respectively. In com-
parison, the average time spent by a user session moving is
9.3 minutes (intra-session movement) and stationary is 31
minutes (average intra-session stationary).
Necessarily, intra-session movements provide more infor-
mation about user movement than inter-session movement.
This is because in intra-session movements, we are capable
of tracing all locations visited by a user while he was online.
In this regards, we look in to whether inter-session move-
ments still capture adequate information when compared to
intra-session movements. We compare the two movements
from the perspective of displacement probability.
Given a time diﬀerence ∆T , we identify all inter-session
and intra-session movements where the user has changed
his location within the time gap: ∆T ± 0.05∆T . Figure 2
shows cumulative distribution function (CDF) of user dis-
placement, i.e., how far a user moves in the given time in-
terval, with intervals ∆T ranging from 20 minutes to one
day. We compute the distance between two locations as the
geodesic or great-circle distance between them, which takes
